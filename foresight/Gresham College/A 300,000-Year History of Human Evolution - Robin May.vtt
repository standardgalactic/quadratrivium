00:28.920 --> 00:39.920
Felly, we are in ourselves a very brief moment in history and so actually 300,000 years for us feels like a long time even if in planetary terms it's the blink of an eye.

00:39.920 --> 00:52.920
So the question is, with that very brief slice of time, can we learn anything useful about human evolution by looking at that and what it might mean for our understanding of who we are today?

00:52.920 --> 00:59.920
The Gresham College lecture that you're listening to right now is giving you knowledge and insight from one of the world's leading academic experts.

00:59.920 --> 01:05.920
Making it takes a lot of time, but because we want to encourage a love of learning, we think it's well worth it.

01:05.920 --> 01:11.920
We never make you pay for lectures, although donations are needed. All we ask in return is this.

01:11.920 --> 01:19.920
Send a link to this lecture to someone you think would benefit, and if you haven't already, click the follow or subscribe button from wherever you're listening right now.

01:20.920 --> 01:22.920
Now, let's get back to the lecture.

01:24.920 --> 01:32.920
When we think about evolution, there's a kind of straightforward and simple rule really, which is that evolution is basically about reproduction.

01:32.920 --> 01:44.920
Stuff that has an impact on your reproduction and most importantly on your offspring's reproduction is really important for evolution and stuff that doesn't is completely irrelevant.

01:45.920 --> 01:53.920
So if I look around this hall, for example, there are some people here who are going to be massively shaped by evolution because they're at the start of their potential reproductive journey.

01:53.920 --> 01:59.920
They may have children, they may not have children, they may have grandchildren, but all of those things are still for play for.

01:59.920 --> 02:06.920
If you're like me pushing the wrong end of your reproductive life, you're becoming significantly less and less important in terms of evolution.

02:07.920 --> 02:15.920
And of course, once you've reproduced and you're post reproductive, anything or nothing that happens to you is invisible to evolution.

02:15.920 --> 02:21.920
And that's an important point. I'm laboring that point because we often ask questions about why do we have this disease?

02:21.920 --> 02:23.920
Why is this problem come up now?

02:23.920 --> 02:27.920
And quite often the answer to that question is because evolution doesn't care.

02:27.920 --> 02:31.920
It's irrelevant because it has no direct impact on reproduction.

02:32.920 --> 02:41.920
So broadly speaking, evolution boils down to the question of how many offspring do you have and how many of those offspring go on to have offspring themselves.

02:41.920 --> 02:45.920
And so you can compare that. This is an example from the British Royal Family, for example.

02:45.920 --> 02:50.920
So here is Queen Victoria surrounded by a couple of generations of her family.

02:50.920 --> 02:52.920
She was very evolutionary successful, right?

02:52.920 --> 02:54.920
There are a lot of offspring here.

02:54.920 --> 02:59.920
And actually, if you're a kind of budding historian and you look at the royal families of Europe,

02:59.920 --> 03:04.920
you can see a sort of genetic legacy of Queen Victoria right across Europe.

03:04.920 --> 03:07.920
That, in evolutionary terms, is very successful.

03:07.920 --> 03:08.920
Not so great over here.

03:08.920 --> 03:11.920
This is William and Mary from the Glorious Revolution.

03:11.920 --> 03:12.920
No children of their own.

03:12.920 --> 03:15.920
And in fact, Mary's sister Anne, who didn't have no children either.

03:15.920 --> 03:18.920
And of course, this is why the throne changed hands.

03:18.920 --> 03:23.920
So evolutionarily speaking, that lineage essentially went extinct.

03:23.920 --> 03:25.920
Why am I putting out pictures of kings and queens here?

03:25.920 --> 03:29.920
The point about this is that if we're measuring evolution and measuring impacts,

03:29.920 --> 03:33.920
the really important thing to measure are these things here, the kids,

03:33.920 --> 03:35.920
and their children, and so on and so forth.

03:35.920 --> 03:40.920
And we need to think about that in terms of features, behaviours,

03:40.920 --> 03:44.920
things that change the survival or reproduction of our children.

03:44.920 --> 03:48.920
So it all ultimately boils down to babies.

03:48.920 --> 03:49.920
A slightly still cute one here.

03:49.920 --> 03:50.920
She's not so cute anymore.

03:50.920 --> 03:54.920
She probably would be very happy about this baby photo of my teenage daughter being on the screen,

03:54.920 --> 03:57.920
but never mind when it gets taken down on YouTube,

03:57.920 --> 04:00.920
even though she's filed an official complaint.

04:00.920 --> 04:04.920
So it's all about the survival and reproduction of babies.

04:04.920 --> 04:10.920
And so if we think about evolution, the strongest forces in shaping all evolution,

04:10.920 --> 04:16.920
but in particular human evolution, are those that impact on infant survival

04:16.920 --> 04:20.920
and ultimately on their reproductive success.

04:20.920 --> 04:25.920
So if we look, for example, at this data from the WHO from a few years ago now,

04:25.920 --> 04:26.920
this is a pretty grim slide.

04:26.920 --> 04:31.920
This is a slide of what means that babies don't survive, infant mortality under five,

04:31.920 --> 04:33.920
the leading cause.

04:33.920 --> 04:35.920
And if you look at that data, first of all, foremost,

04:35.920 --> 04:39.920
I think it's important to say this is actually a tragic indictment of where we are today

04:39.920 --> 04:42.920
because many, many, many of these things are preventable

04:42.920 --> 04:45.920
and should not be causing infant mortality,

04:45.920 --> 04:50.920
wherever they are, because of inequality and poverty and all the other things that go with it.

04:50.920 --> 04:55.920
That notwithstanding, in evolutionary terms, if we look at these leading causes of death,

04:55.920 --> 04:58.920
the majority of them are infectious diseases.

04:58.920 --> 05:01.920
So at a first approximation, your biggest risk,

05:01.920 --> 05:04.920
if you're a newborn human infant on planet Earth,

05:04.920 --> 05:07.920
is something that will infect you early on.

05:07.920 --> 05:09.920
And if it infects you and it kills you, that's it,

05:09.920 --> 05:11.920
you're removed from the gene pool, your evolution.

05:11.920 --> 05:14.920
Re-contribution has finished.

05:14.920 --> 05:20.920
So we might expect, then, that if we're looking for evidence of what has shaped human evolution,

05:20.920 --> 05:26.920
that these infectious forces will be the place where we are most likely to find that evidence.

05:26.920 --> 05:32.920
And to a first approximation, then, infection is a big evolutionary problem,

05:32.920 --> 05:37.920
and things that overcome infection are big evolutionary successes.

05:37.920 --> 05:42.920
So can we learn about those processes over the last 300,000 years

05:42.920 --> 05:44.920
by looking at human evolution?

05:44.920 --> 05:48.920
And to quickly recap, for those of you who didn't see the previous lecture,

05:48.920 --> 05:52.920
and with the caveat that these dates change all the time,

05:52.920 --> 05:54.920
this is an incredibly fast-moving field.

05:54.920 --> 05:57.920
People discover new fossils, new DNA all the time.

05:57.920 --> 06:00.920
So with the caveat that this is probably wrong already,

06:00.920 --> 06:02.920
and definitely will be by the time I finish this lecture,

06:02.920 --> 06:08.920
this, roughly speaking, is how we think of the evolution of our own species, Homo sapiens.

06:08.920 --> 06:11.920
So you roll the clock back, say, 600,000 years.

06:11.920 --> 06:16.920
This hominin species Homo heidelbergensis is roaming Africa.

06:16.920 --> 06:22.920
It spreads out from Africa to Europe, where it evolves into the species we know of as Neanderthals.

06:22.920 --> 06:26.920
It migrates across to Asia and becomes this enigmatic species

06:26.920 --> 06:29.920
about which we know very little other than their DNA sequence

06:29.920 --> 06:33.920
and a few tiny fossils called the Denisavans.

06:33.920 --> 06:37.920
And then subsequently, about 300,000 years ago,

06:37.920 --> 06:41.920
that species that has remained in Africa has evolved again

06:41.920 --> 06:43.920
into what we would call anatomically modern humans,

06:43.920 --> 06:48.920
migrate out of Europe again and meet all these other species around the world

06:48.920 --> 06:53.920
and go on to populate the entire planet as we know it today.

06:53.920 --> 06:56.920
And this graph, which I showed last time, lifted from the Natural History Museum,

06:56.920 --> 06:59.920
shows us up here, Homo sapiens at the top corner,

06:59.920 --> 07:03.920
and the fact that we now know that up until about 50,000 years ago,

07:03.920 --> 07:07.920
we shared at least parts of the planet with these other species,

07:07.920 --> 07:09.920
certainly the Denisavans and the Neanderthals,

07:09.920 --> 07:12.920
and who knows possibly other species too.

07:14.920 --> 07:17.920
So the key and important fact about this is that we have a species,

07:17.920 --> 07:21.920
anatomically modern humans that evolved in Africa, that migrated out,

07:21.920 --> 07:25.920
they came into Europe, and we have this delightful phrase that geneticists like to use,

07:25.920 --> 07:29.920
admixture, which basically means mating with other people.

07:29.920 --> 07:34.920
And so admixture occurred, mating occurred between these ancient,

07:34.920 --> 07:39.920
but modern anatomically Homo sapiens and Neanderthals in Europe,

07:39.920 --> 07:44.920
and then again with this group called the Denisavans over in Asia.

07:44.920 --> 07:48.920
And so modern humans are this blend of these hybrid existences,

07:48.920 --> 07:53.920
and you can find out much more about that from various sources online if you want.

07:54.920 --> 07:56.920
Why am I telling you about this? I'm telling you about this

07:56.920 --> 08:00.920
because this gives us a powerful tool to understand much more

08:00.920 --> 08:04.920
about how evolution has shaped modern humans.

08:04.920 --> 08:07.920
Because we can look at these hybridisation events,

08:07.920 --> 08:11.920
or these ancient matings between Homo sapiens and other species,

08:11.920 --> 08:13.920
and we can look at the exchange of genes,

08:13.920 --> 08:19.920
and we can ask which of those genes have had an evolutionary consequence for us as a species.

08:19.920 --> 08:24.920
And what does it tell us about the last 50,000 years?

08:24.920 --> 08:26.920
So let me explain what I mean by that.

08:26.920 --> 08:31.920
So here we have this ancient mating event, and this is a PG lecture,

08:31.920 --> 08:32.920
so I'm going to show skeletons.

08:32.920 --> 08:35.920
So here we have Homo sapiens skeleton,

08:35.920 --> 08:39.920
and on the other side we have Neanderthal skeleton, very similar,

08:39.920 --> 08:42.920
bit stockier, more chunky, various anatomical differences

08:42.920 --> 08:46.920
that mean you can distinguish it but broadly speaking similar.

08:47.920 --> 08:52.920
When any two organisms mate, and hopefully you might remember this from your school biology lessons,

08:52.920 --> 08:56.920
each of us carries two copies of each of our chromosomes.

08:56.920 --> 08:59.920
One inherited from our mum, and one from our dad.

09:00.920 --> 09:02.920
When you produce sperm and eggs, they separate,

09:02.920 --> 09:05.920
each sperm or egg getting one or the other.

09:05.920 --> 09:07.920
And then when you mate with somebody else,

09:07.920 --> 09:09.920
one of theirs comes together with one of yours,

09:09.920 --> 09:11.920
and you get a new combination.

09:11.920 --> 09:14.920
Hopefully that's not news to anybody listening to this.

09:14.920 --> 09:17.920
When this ancient Neanderthal and Homo sapiens mate,

09:17.920 --> 09:19.920
exactly the same process happened.

09:19.920 --> 09:23.920
So one Homo sapiens chromosome was in a sperm or an egg,

09:23.920 --> 09:26.920
they mate it with this Neanderthal,

09:26.920 --> 09:28.920
one of their chromosomes came together,

09:28.920 --> 09:32.920
and you end up with this two, one from each parent, just like anybody else.

09:33.920 --> 09:38.920
The offspring of any mating, that includes all of us in the room and all those listening,

09:38.920 --> 09:39.920
so you have two chromosomes.

09:39.920 --> 09:42.920
When you produce your own sperm and eggs,

09:42.920 --> 09:45.920
those two chromosomes that you've got, one from mum and one from dad,

09:45.920 --> 09:47.920
do a process called crossing over.

09:47.920 --> 09:51.920
So before you produce sperm or eggs, they come together,

09:51.920 --> 09:54.920
and they exchange bits of DNA between each other.

09:54.920 --> 09:58.920
And so what you end up with when you produce, for example, an egg cell,

09:58.920 --> 10:03.920
is not a cell that has just your mum's chromosome or just your dad's,

10:03.920 --> 10:07.920
but they have a chromosome that has, for example, been inherited from your dad,

10:07.920 --> 10:10.920
but with bits of your mum's or vice versa.

10:10.920 --> 10:13.920
And this is one of the processes by which we get variation,

10:13.920 --> 10:17.920
and this is why we don't all look like an exact clone of our grandmother or grandfather,

10:17.920 --> 10:22.920
even though you've got part of their chromosome because there's been a genetic reshuffling.

10:23.920 --> 10:29.920
That process happened also 50,000 years ago when Homo sapiens and Neanderthals mate it.

10:29.920 --> 10:33.920
And so what you end up with in the first and second generation of this cross

10:33.920 --> 10:39.920
are chromosomes that are a blend of the Homo sapiens DNA and the Neanderthal DNA.

10:40.920 --> 10:42.920
So, in this colour scheme, they look like this.

10:42.920 --> 10:44.920
They're not regularly striped, obviously,

10:44.920 --> 10:48.920
but they have some genes from the Homo sapiens parent

10:48.920 --> 10:51.920
and some from the Neanderthal parent.

10:51.920 --> 10:55.920
And the important point is that to a first approximation,

10:55.920 --> 10:58.920
that process of shuffling is random.

10:58.920 --> 11:03.920
So what you should expect is that these offspring have a random inheritance

11:03.920 --> 11:07.920
of genes that were either sapiens or Neanderthal.

11:07.920 --> 11:10.920
Now, that offspring is going to go away,

11:10.920 --> 11:12.920
and they're going to have their own offspring and so on and so forth.

11:12.920 --> 11:17.920
And what you should expect if all of those genes are essentially completely neutral,

11:17.920 --> 11:20.920
they have no impact, is that over time,

11:20.920 --> 11:24.920
the distribution of Neanderthal genes and Homo sapiens genes

11:24.920 --> 11:27.920
will remain random across your chromosomes.

11:27.920 --> 11:31.920
And that means that if I were to look today at all of you sitting here listening to this

11:31.920 --> 11:34.920
and to sequence your DNA, which is, of course, possible,

11:34.920 --> 11:40.920
what I should see is a totally random distribution of Neanderthal genes across your genome.

11:40.920 --> 11:42.920
But that's not what we see, actually.

11:42.920 --> 11:45.920
So what we generally see is something that looks a bit more like this.

11:45.920 --> 11:52.920
Broadly speaking, most of your genome is a random mixture of Neanderthal and Homo sapiens.

11:52.920 --> 11:55.920
So if you're European, for example, I mean,

11:55.920 --> 11:58.920
then you've got about 2% Neanderthal DNA,

11:58.920 --> 12:03.920
and that is roughly speaking distributed pretty evenly across your chromosomes.

12:03.920 --> 12:09.920
With the exception of occasional patches where you see either no DNA at all from a Neanderthal,

12:09.920 --> 12:12.920
you have only Homo sapiens DNA, or the reverse,

12:12.920 --> 12:16.920
you are highly enriched from Neanderthal DNA in that area.

12:16.920 --> 12:17.920
Why do we see that?

12:17.920 --> 12:23.920
We see that because that is a hallmark of the fact that this is no longer a neutral bit of DNA.

12:23.920 --> 12:24.920
It's no longer a neutral gene.

12:24.920 --> 12:27.920
What it means, so in this example here, for example,

12:27.920 --> 12:31.920
here you have a blue patch, which is only Homo sapiens DNA.

12:31.920 --> 12:38.920
So what that means is that the equivalent Neanderthal gene has been selected against.

12:38.920 --> 12:44.920
It's been a bad idea over the last 50,000 years to have Neanderthal DNA in this bit of your chromosome.

12:44.920 --> 12:49.920
Whatever the gene was you inherited there was not helpful, and it has been selected against.

12:49.920 --> 12:54.920
Conversely, if you have a patch like this, we have more Neanderthal DNA than by chance.

12:54.920 --> 13:00.920
That means something that Neanderthal great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandparent gave you was useful,

13:00.920 --> 13:04.920
and it has been retained despite this random process.

13:04.920 --> 13:08.920
So we can look in modern human genames, in all of your genames,

13:08.920 --> 13:11.920
and we can look for patches that look like this, and when we see them, we can say,

13:11.920 --> 13:15.920
okay, something here has been important over the last 50,000 years.

13:15.920 --> 13:19.920
What is it and what might it have done?

13:19.920 --> 13:21.920
And that's exactly what various groups have done,

13:21.920 --> 13:25.920
and this in particular is work of Josh Ake, Serena Tucci and others,

13:25.920 --> 13:29.920
where they have looked in modern genames, and what they've done particularly well in this

13:29.920 --> 13:32.920
is they have looked in two distinct populations.

13:32.920 --> 13:36.920
Modern Europeans, people living, for example, in London today,

13:36.920 --> 13:40.920
and modern Asians living in various parts of Asia.

13:40.920 --> 13:45.920
And the point about doing two populations is what if there is a gene that has been selected for

13:45.920 --> 13:50.920
because it benefits modern humans broadly, it should be in both of those populations.

13:50.920 --> 13:55.920
And if there's one that's particularly specific, I don't know, it helps you navigate the tube in London, for example,

13:55.920 --> 13:59.920
then it will only be in the European population and not the Asian or vice versa.

13:59.920 --> 14:02.920
So when we do that, that is exactly what you see.

14:02.920 --> 14:05.920
So here on this graph at the top, what you see is a chromosome.

14:05.920 --> 14:09.920
This is chromosome 7, human chromosome 7, and the little red and blue lines

14:09.920 --> 14:14.920
are indications of where there are neanderthal bits of DNA still in that chromosome.

14:14.920 --> 14:18.920
And what you see is that, roughly speaking, most of the chromosome, they're pretty random,

14:18.920 --> 14:24.920
except that it's pretty clear, I think, that here is a patch where we don't have any neanderthal DNA.

14:24.920 --> 14:29.920
Why is that? That must be, the assumption is, that's because whatever was on that chromosome from the anatol

14:29.920 --> 14:34.920
was not helpful, was not good, and it's actually disadvantaged people carrying it

14:34.920 --> 14:37.920
in the sense that they have not reproduced as well as the rest of us

14:37.920 --> 14:40.920
and they have been lost from the population.

14:40.920 --> 14:44.920
And when we look in that region, one of the genes that's in this region,

14:44.920 --> 14:47.920
turns out to be this rather delightful one called Fox P2.

14:47.920 --> 14:51.920
And Fox P2, in codes of protein, which you can see here spinning around,

14:51.920 --> 14:56.920
which we have known about for some years, because this protein is incredibly important for language.

14:56.920 --> 15:02.920
So modern living humans, for example, who have mutations in this protein,

15:02.920 --> 15:07.920
often have very severe learning defects around language and communication,

15:07.920 --> 15:12.920
speech defects, and are not very successful in being able to communicate.

15:12.920 --> 15:17.920
If you look ancestrally, modern humans have evolved this gene much faster than chance.

15:18.920 --> 15:21.920
It suggests the gene itself is under very strong selection to do something.

15:21.920 --> 15:25.920
And it's different to other primate versions of this gene, for example,

15:25.920 --> 15:28.920
and it's different to the neanderthal version.

15:28.920 --> 15:32.920
And so the assumption we have here, which I think is a pretty reasonable hypothesis,

15:32.920 --> 15:37.920
is that the neanderthal version of this gene did not allow you to do what these people are doing here,

15:37.920 --> 15:42.920
did not allow you to participate in communication in the same way that modern homo sapiens did.

15:43.920 --> 15:49.920
So, for example, if you were a hybrid from this neanderthal homo sapiens cross 50,000 years ago,

15:49.920 --> 15:53.920
you would probably struggle to communicate with other members of your species.

15:53.920 --> 15:55.920
And for those of us who have had a very nervous first date,

15:55.920 --> 15:58.920
we know that communication is quite important for reproduction.

15:58.920 --> 16:01.920
So if you couldn't communicate, you probably didn't reproduce very well,

16:01.920 --> 16:04.920
and so those genes have been lost from the population.

16:05.920 --> 16:08.920
So this is one example of a neanderthal gene that we haven't got anymore,

16:08.920 --> 16:10.920
because it wasn't advantageous.

16:10.920 --> 16:12.920
Can we find examples of genes that are the opposite,

16:12.920 --> 16:16.920
where that neanderthal history has benefited us?

16:16.920 --> 16:18.920
And of course we can.

16:18.920 --> 16:21.920
And so we can look on chromosomes for the opposite pattern.

16:21.920 --> 16:23.920
So now we're looking not for those gaps,

16:23.920 --> 16:27.920
but for places where the red and the blue genes are very, very dense,

16:27.920 --> 16:29.920
more dense than the rest of the chromosome.

16:29.920 --> 16:33.920
And you can see here on chromosome 3, one neat example here.

16:33.920 --> 16:36.920
But what's clever about this example, I hope you can see this,

16:36.920 --> 16:39.920
is that there are lots of red lines there.

16:39.920 --> 16:43.920
So these are the ones derived from modern Asian humans.

16:43.920 --> 16:48.920
So lots of people in Asia carry this neanderthal gene,

16:48.920 --> 16:51.920
but it's missing from European populations.

16:51.920 --> 16:54.920
So the assumption here is that whatever this gene is,

16:54.920 --> 16:56.920
whatever this DNA region is here,

16:56.920 --> 16:59.920
it has been helpful, it's been kept,

16:59.920 --> 17:02.920
but only if you have a lineage in Asia.

17:02.920 --> 17:06.920
So there's something here that is in some way that we don't quite understand,

17:06.920 --> 17:10.920
beneficial for survival and reproduction in that part of the world,

17:10.920 --> 17:13.920
less beneficial in Europe.

17:13.920 --> 17:16.920
And it turns out when you look at this region of DNA,

17:16.920 --> 17:18.920
there are several genes in here,

17:18.920 --> 17:21.920
but there's a little cluster here called HYAL,

17:21.920 --> 17:23.920
Hyaluronic Acid genes.

17:23.920 --> 17:27.920
And these genes encode proteins that are incredibly important

17:27.920 --> 17:31.920
for rebuilding cellular structures after DNA damage.

17:31.920 --> 17:35.920
And in particular after DNA damage caused by sunshine,

17:35.920 --> 17:37.920
because by ultraviolet irradiation.

17:37.920 --> 17:40.920
So, for example, if you have a poorly functioning version of this gene,

17:40.920 --> 17:42.920
you burn incredibly easily.

17:42.920 --> 17:46.920
You get very bad sunburn quite rapidly.

17:46.920 --> 17:50.920
And so the hypothesis here is that back 50,000 years ago,

17:50.920 --> 17:54.920
we picked up this version of a gene from neanderthal crosses.

17:54.920 --> 17:58.920
It confers better protection against ultraviolet irradiation.

17:58.920 --> 18:01.920
If you're in a grey and misty northern Britain,

18:01.920 --> 18:03.920
that is pretty irrelevant,

18:03.920 --> 18:06.920
but if you're in a sun-baked Asian desert, for example,

18:06.920 --> 18:09.920
it's really quite important to be able to survive sunburn.

18:09.920 --> 18:12.920
And so this gene has been retained in the populations that needed it

18:12.920 --> 18:16.920
and not in the pale kind of rainy populations of Europe

18:16.920 --> 18:19.920
like the one we're standing in today.

18:19.920 --> 18:21.920
So that's an example that goes the other way.

18:21.920 --> 18:24.920
And then perhaps the neatest example that I really like of this study

18:24.920 --> 18:28.920
is the one here, which applies equally to all modern humans.

18:28.920 --> 18:31.920
So now we're looking for a region, this is on chromosome 12.

18:31.920 --> 18:34.920
And there is a region here, I hope you can see it,

18:34.920 --> 18:39.920
very, very densely populated with neanderthal DNA in both populations.

18:39.920 --> 18:42.920
So in both European and Asian populations.

18:42.920 --> 18:47.920
So here in this region is something that we inherited from neanderthals.

18:47.920 --> 18:49.920
It's turned out to be really useful for all humans,

18:49.920 --> 18:51.920
or at least all the ones that we've sequenced,

18:51.920 --> 18:55.920
and it's been kept at very high frequency.

18:55.920 --> 18:58.920
And this little gene cluster here contains three genes,

18:58.920 --> 19:01.920
all very closely related, called the OAS genes.

19:01.920 --> 19:04.920
And these genes are very, very important

19:04.920 --> 19:06.920
because they drive an immune process.

19:06.920 --> 19:11.920
And what they do is they detect and respond to viral infections.

19:11.920 --> 19:15.920
And it's a very clever system because what this gene does is it keeps back,

19:15.920 --> 19:19.920
it keeps under control the very powerful weapons that you use against a virus

19:19.920 --> 19:22.920
to avoid them doing damage when you're not infected.

19:22.920 --> 19:26.920
When a virus appears, these genes respond and they drive the production

19:26.920 --> 19:32.920
of one of these antiviral weapons that we have, called RNAs.

19:32.920 --> 19:35.920
And this essentially is a degrading enzyme,

19:35.920 --> 19:37.920
something that chews up viruses.

19:37.920 --> 19:40.920
And as you may know, viruses come broadly speaking in two flavours.

19:40.920 --> 19:45.920
There are some that have a genome that is made of DNA, like our genome,

19:45.920 --> 19:48.920
but there are many, many viruses that have a genome made of RNA,

19:48.920 --> 19:51.920
a related but different molecule.

19:51.920 --> 19:53.920
And so because our genome is made of DNA,

19:53.920 --> 19:55.920
but a virus is made of RNA,

19:55.920 --> 19:58.920
that gives you a tool to destroy a virus by targeting that RNA,

19:58.920 --> 20:01.920
and that's what this tool does.

20:01.920 --> 20:05.920
So when you detect a viral infection, these OAS genes turn on this weapon,

20:05.920 --> 20:07.920
this RNA's weapon, the weapon is produced,

20:07.920 --> 20:11.920
and it comes and it degrades the virus you're infected with.

20:11.920 --> 20:13.920
So this seems like quite a good thing to have,

20:13.920 --> 20:17.920
and so the hypothesis is maybe the neanderthal version of these genes

20:17.920 --> 20:19.920
is a bit better at dealing with viruses,

20:19.920 --> 20:22.920
and so that's why we have kept it so well, and that is exactly true.

20:22.920 --> 20:25.920
In fact, it turns out that you can do these experiments in the lab.

20:25.920 --> 20:28.920
If you have the neanderthal version of these genes,

20:28.920 --> 20:30.920
rather than the homoesapiens version,

20:30.920 --> 20:34.920
you are much better at controlling a whole variety of viruses, actually,

20:34.920 --> 20:39.920
particular things like hepatitis C, tibialynecatholitis, and West Nile virus.

20:39.920 --> 20:43.920
And one of the interesting things about this is the virus group

20:43.920 --> 20:46.920
that you are particularly good at controlling if you have these genes

20:46.920 --> 20:49.920
all belong to a group called the Flavi viruses.

20:49.920 --> 20:52.920
And so, to me, at least, that is quite compelling evidence

20:52.920 --> 20:56.920
that at some point between that mating with neanderthals 50,000 years ago

20:56.920 --> 21:00.920
and today, we have been through quite a strong selective pressure

21:00.920 --> 21:03.920
in which Flavi viruses were a really big problem.

21:03.920 --> 21:07.920
And so what happened was people who did not have this extra protection

21:07.920 --> 21:10.920
succumbed, died, didn't inherit their genes.

21:10.920 --> 21:13.920
Those people who carried this extra neanderthal gene

21:13.920 --> 21:17.920
were able to survive those pandemics, if you want to call them that,

21:17.920 --> 21:21.920
and give their genes on, and that's why we see those genes today.

21:21.920 --> 21:24.920
The last twist in this rather neat tale, I think,

21:24.920 --> 21:27.920
is that these neanderthal genes that we inherited

21:27.920 --> 21:32.920
have apparently helped us survive at some point in the last 50,000 years.

21:32.920 --> 21:35.920
But even more importantly, they have also helped us survive

21:35.920 --> 21:37.920
in the last five years.

21:37.920 --> 21:40.920
Because you may know that during the COVID-19 pandemic,

21:40.920 --> 21:45.920
there was intense interest in what made individual differences

21:45.920 --> 21:47.920
in our response to the virus.

21:47.920 --> 21:50.920
And we will all know people who got COVID-19 and carried on

21:50.920 --> 21:53.920
as if nothing had happened, they were completely fitting well.

21:53.920 --> 21:55.920
And unfortunately, many of us will also know people

21:55.920 --> 21:57.920
who were very severely ill or perhaps died.

21:57.920 --> 22:00.920
And the question became quite often,

22:00.920 --> 22:03.920
why is it that two people who are superficially very similar

22:03.920 --> 22:06.920
may respond so differently to that virus?

22:06.920 --> 22:09.920
And so many groups looked at this by sequencing DNA

22:09.920 --> 22:12.920
in those different people and asking what genes to people

22:12.920 --> 22:14.920
who seem to brush off the virus have

22:14.920 --> 22:17.920
that are missing in people who get severely ill.

22:17.920 --> 22:20.920
And it turns out that one of those genes that you can see over here

22:20.920 --> 22:23.920
is exactly this, OAS3.

22:23.920 --> 22:26.920
So it turns out that if you have this neanderthal gene,

22:26.920 --> 22:29.920
your ancestors survived some pandemic in the last 50,000 years,

22:29.920 --> 22:31.920
and that's why you're here today.

22:31.920 --> 22:33.920
But the fact that you're physically here today

22:33.920 --> 22:35.920
in this hall listening to me may also be

22:35.920 --> 22:38.920
because that same gene has helped you survive the pandemic

22:38.920 --> 22:41.920
that we've all been through in the last four or five years.

22:41.920 --> 22:43.920
Quite a salient reminder, I think,

22:43.920 --> 22:45.920
that evolution is not all about dead stuff.

22:45.920 --> 22:47.920
It's also about what happens today

22:47.920 --> 22:50.920
and understanding it is really, really important.

22:53.920 --> 22:56.920
So that all feels and is ancient history.

22:56.920 --> 22:59.920
We're talking about things that happened 50,000 years ago,

22:59.920 --> 23:01.920
and albeit they may have an impact today.

23:01.920 --> 23:04.920
But it's still quite difficult to get your head around

23:04.920 --> 23:07.920
neanderthal matings 50,000 years ago.

23:07.920 --> 23:10.920
But the question is, and I'd like to turn to you now,

23:10.920 --> 23:13.920
is really, can we see anything that's even more recent than that?

23:13.920 --> 23:17.920
And I said at the beginning that evolution works on very slow time scales,

23:17.920 --> 23:19.920
usually millions of years.

23:19.920 --> 23:22.920
So asking whether we can see anything evolutionarily

23:22.920 --> 23:25.920
over thousands of years is a bit of a tall order.

23:25.920 --> 23:28.920
But nonetheless, with the power in particular

23:28.920 --> 23:30.920
of very, very advanced genetics

23:30.920 --> 23:33.920
that we have received over recent years,

23:33.920 --> 23:37.920
we're now in a position to start to see things that have evolved humanity

23:37.920 --> 23:39.920
over not just a blink of an eye,

23:39.920 --> 23:42.920
but an absolute nanosecond of evolutionary time

23:42.920 --> 23:45.920
just in the last few thousand years.

23:45.920 --> 23:48.920
And one of the points that I think is particularly notable

23:48.920 --> 23:51.920
is that we think of evolutionary events

23:51.920 --> 23:53.920
as being standalone.

23:53.920 --> 23:56.920
We think of, for example, humans migrated out of Africa,

23:56.920 --> 23:59.920
that was lovely, got to rest the world, end of season.

23:59.920 --> 24:01.920
But actually, of course, that's not how it works.

24:01.920 --> 24:04.920
When something changes, it has a knock-on impact.

24:04.920 --> 24:08.920
So, you know, if we start to evolve tool use, for example,

24:08.920 --> 24:10.920
that had a direct impact on humans,

24:10.920 --> 24:12.920
because we could benefit from that tool use,

24:12.920 --> 24:15.920
but it also had a direct impact on other species.

24:15.920 --> 24:17.920
For example, trees that were now cut down

24:17.920 --> 24:20.920
that would not previously have been able to be cut down.

24:20.920 --> 24:22.920
So there are follow-on impacts.

24:22.920 --> 24:25.920
In other words, evolution can spawn more evolution.

24:25.920 --> 24:28.920
If you think about the evolution of flight in birds,

24:28.920 --> 24:31.920
before birds could fly, there was no need for trees to have fruit

24:31.920 --> 24:33.920
that could be kind of spread in the canopy.

24:33.920 --> 24:36.920
As soon as they had flying birds that could spread it around,

24:36.920 --> 24:39.920
it made sense to evolve fruit that might be attractive to those birds

24:39.920 --> 24:42.920
high up in the canopy, and so on and so forth.

24:42.920 --> 24:44.920
So humans have evolved, too.

24:44.920 --> 24:47.920
So the question is, have we evolved in a way that has then shaped

24:47.920 --> 24:49.920
our own evolution?

24:49.920 --> 24:51.920
And the answer to that is definitively yes.

24:51.920 --> 24:54.920
And the bit of human evolution I want to talk about

24:54.920 --> 24:58.920
is this one, is the transition from, if you like,

24:58.920 --> 25:01.920
hunter-gatherer nomadic individual humans

25:01.920 --> 25:04.920
to the kind of humans we recognize today,

25:04.920 --> 25:07.920
people who are urbanized, people who live with agriculture,

25:07.920 --> 25:12.920
people who do all these kind of things that society today depends on.

25:12.920 --> 25:15.920
And we know actually quite a bit about how this happens.

25:15.920 --> 25:20.920
So what we know is that around about 10,000 or 11,000 years ago,

25:20.920 --> 25:24.920
up until that point, most humans had been hunter-gatherers,

25:24.920 --> 25:28.920
nomadic, spreading over large areas, no particular pattern.

25:29.920 --> 25:32.920
Around 10 or 11,000 years ago, we start to see evidence

25:32.920 --> 25:35.920
of people returning to the same place again and again.

25:35.920 --> 25:38.920
Maybe that's because they realized that was a good place to be,

25:38.920 --> 25:40.920
it was a safe place to be, it had good food, whatever,

25:40.920 --> 25:42.920
but they came back to the same place.

25:42.920 --> 25:46.920
What we think probably happened was that in their hunting and gathering,

25:46.920 --> 25:48.920
they would, of course, have brought food home.

25:48.920 --> 25:52.920
They would have spilt food, particularly nuts and seeds and grains,

25:52.920 --> 25:54.920
and some of those would have germinated.

25:54.920 --> 25:57.920
And then, of course, if you were a savvy hunter-gatherer 11,000 years ago,

25:57.920 --> 26:00.920
you realize that actually, if your corn is growing here,

26:00.920 --> 26:02.920
you don't have to go out to hunt and gather it

26:02.920 --> 26:04.920
and run the risk of being eaten, you can stay here.

26:04.920 --> 26:09.920
And so bit by bit, what we now recognize as agriculture evolved.

26:09.920 --> 26:11.920
So instead of gathering stuff from the wild,

26:11.920 --> 26:14.920
you could sow stuff and you could keep it in one place.

26:14.920 --> 26:17.920
Subsequently, people then realized you could do similar things with animals,

26:17.920 --> 26:20.920
we started to keep livestock, so on and so forth.

26:20.920 --> 26:24.920
And that agricultural revolution has been incredibly important

26:24.920 --> 26:29.920
for human society, but also incredibly important for human evolution.

26:29.920 --> 26:33.920
And we can start to see, using modern genetic tools,

26:33.920 --> 26:37.920
just how important that has been.

26:37.920 --> 26:40.920
So the evolution of agriculture has been most intensely studied

26:40.920 --> 26:43.920
in an area called the fertile crescent.

26:43.920 --> 26:45.920
Unfortunately, it is now a very troubled part of the world,

26:45.920 --> 26:49.920
so ranging from Egypt through to Iraq in a longer swath here.

26:49.920 --> 26:52.920
It's important to note that we actually know that agriculture

26:52.920 --> 26:55.920
was being evolved in parallel in other places, Asia,

26:55.920 --> 26:58.920
for example, the domestication of rice south America.

26:58.920 --> 27:01.920
But actually, because most of the work and science,

27:01.920 --> 27:04.920
if you like, has been in this area, this is the area we know the most about

27:04.920 --> 27:06.920
in terms of the evolution of agriculture.

27:06.920 --> 27:09.920
And what we know is that about 10,000 years ago,

27:09.920 --> 27:12.920
people started to domesticate certain key crops.

27:12.920 --> 27:15.920
And we can see that in those crops themselves,

27:15.920 --> 27:18.920
because you can see hallmarks of very rapid evolution

27:18.920 --> 27:22.920
as people started to select for crops that were, for example,

27:22.920 --> 27:27.920
bigger or more edible or more durable around 10,000 years ago.

27:27.920 --> 27:31.920
So at about 10,000 years ago, in this area, certainly of the fertile crescent,

27:31.920 --> 27:34.920
and elsewhere in the world, humans were starting to develop agriculture,

27:34.920 --> 27:39.920
and that had a really important impact on lots of things about being human.

27:39.920 --> 27:43.920
And the first one, and one that's often overlooked,

27:43.920 --> 27:46.920
is that it allowed us to stay put.

27:46.920 --> 27:50.920
Up until then, for the rest of human history, we'd had to migrate around,

27:50.920 --> 27:54.920
because if you need to hunt and gather, you need to be where the stuff to be gathered is.

27:54.920 --> 27:57.920
It's no good staying put and hoping that your kind of banana is going to come to you.

27:57.920 --> 27:59.920
You've got to go and find the banana.

27:59.920 --> 28:01.920
When you start to do agriculture, you can stay in one place,

28:01.920 --> 28:03.920
and you can start to put down roots.

28:03.920 --> 28:07.920
In other words, you can start to do what we now recognise as urbanisation,

28:07.920 --> 28:10.920
and build villages and then towns and then ultimately cities.

28:10.920 --> 28:15.920
And this, for example, is one of the earliest examples of a town in what is now Turkey.

28:15.920 --> 28:19.920
So agriculture, the development agriculture, had multiple impacts.

28:19.920 --> 28:22.920
The first one, obviously, is it changed what we ate,

28:22.920 --> 28:25.920
probably not into this rather delicious-looking meal here,

28:25.920 --> 28:27.920
but it nonetheless changed quite randomly what we ate.

28:27.920 --> 28:31.920
And a common misconception is that it must have made things better.

28:31.920 --> 28:34.920
Actually, all the evidence suggests it made things worse.

28:34.920 --> 28:40.920
If you look at the early nutritional profile of people at this cusp of agriculture,

28:40.920 --> 28:44.920
their nutritional profile is actually worse than the hunter-gatherers that preceded them.

28:44.920 --> 28:48.920
And the reason for that is that the diversity of their diet collapsed.

28:48.920 --> 28:54.920
They went from eating loads and loads of different species to eating a very, very small subset.

28:54.920 --> 28:58.920
So they had a much more reliable food source because they were growing it themselves,

28:58.920 --> 29:00.920
but a much more diminished one in terms of diversity,

29:00.920 --> 29:05.920
and that had quite an important impact in terms of nutrients, as we'll see in a second.

29:05.920 --> 29:10.920
The second impact is that it allowed humans to start to achieve densities,

29:10.920 --> 29:13.920
population sizes that we'd never seen previously.

29:13.920 --> 29:15.920
Prior to this point in human history,

29:15.920 --> 29:19.920
we were very small groups of nomadic hunter-gatherers that travelled around,

29:19.920 --> 29:22.920
and you couldn't get very big because you couldn't stay in one place,

29:22.920 --> 29:25.920
you couldn't sustain a big population.

29:25.920 --> 29:28.920
Now, you're staying in one place, you're growing your own food,

29:28.920 --> 29:31.920
you can expand agriculture, you can get to high densities.

29:31.920 --> 29:34.920
High densities are very important for society.

29:34.920 --> 29:39.920
They're also quite important for some bad things, most notably infectious diseases.

29:41.920 --> 29:46.920
And thirdly, we started to live much more closely with other species,

29:46.920 --> 29:48.920
not quite like this, but with other species.

29:48.920 --> 29:52.920
By domesticating livestock, we started to share our homes,

29:52.920 --> 29:55.920
literally share our homes, with all sorts of species,

29:55.920 --> 29:59.920
goats, dogs, sheep, cows, so on and so forth.

29:59.920 --> 30:02.920
And a whole bunch of species that we didn't intend, but they came anyway,

30:02.920 --> 30:05.920
rats, mice, et cetera, et cetera.

30:06.920 --> 30:10.920
And that mixing pot has had a really profound impact

30:10.920 --> 30:14.920
on the subsequent evolution of humans over the last 10,000 years.

30:14.920 --> 30:17.920
And let me show you a few examples of that.

30:17.920 --> 30:19.920
So, here's the first one.

30:19.920 --> 30:22.920
This, obviously, is wheat, this is a crop that we eat.

30:22.920 --> 30:26.920
I said just now that one of the things that happened when we moved to agriculture

30:26.920 --> 30:29.920
is that we diminished the diversity of our diet.

30:29.920 --> 30:31.920
We had plenty more calories, so that's a good start,

30:31.920 --> 30:34.920
but we missed out on things that were nutrients

30:34.920 --> 30:37.920
that were not necessarily present in all our plants.

30:37.920 --> 30:39.920
So, for example, if you eat 50 different species,

30:39.920 --> 30:42.920
you're going to pick up nutrients from lots of different species.

30:42.920 --> 30:45.920
If you eat three species, you may well be missing something

30:45.920 --> 30:49.920
that is only produced in that four species that you'll no longer eating.

30:49.920 --> 30:51.920
And that is true.

30:51.920 --> 30:54.920
So, we know, for example, there is an amino acid called ergyffion,

30:54.920 --> 30:57.920
and ergyffion is actually still a bit unclear why we need it,

30:57.920 --> 30:58.920
but we do need it.

30:58.920 --> 31:00.920
We don't make that ourselves.

31:00.920 --> 31:03.920
And, in fact, many, many species do not make ergyffion,

31:03.920 --> 31:06.920
including most of the major crop species.

31:06.920 --> 31:10.920
So, we have to get it from things like fungi, for example.

31:10.920 --> 31:12.920
So, when we switch, and that was not a problem,

31:12.920 --> 31:15.920
when you were outhunter gathering and finding your own mushrooms and everything else,

31:15.920 --> 31:18.920
when you switched to eating largely grain crops,

31:18.920 --> 31:21.920
you suddenly missed out on this ergyffion.

31:21.920 --> 31:26.920
And that has, that impact is now clear in modern human genomes,

31:26.920 --> 31:30.920
because the gene you need to harvest ergyffion from your food

31:30.920 --> 31:33.920
encodes a protein, OCTN1, like this,

31:33.920 --> 31:37.920
which picks up ergyffion in your diet and puts it into your bloodstream.

31:37.920 --> 31:40.920
And this gene we can see in modern human populations

31:40.920 --> 31:42.920
comes in different flavours.

31:42.920 --> 31:47.920
Some people present in the audience probably don't produce very much of this,

31:47.920 --> 31:50.920
but many of us have a version that is much more active.

31:50.920 --> 31:55.920
In fact, it's 50% more effective at getting ergyffion in out of your food

31:55.920 --> 31:57.920
than the other type of the gene.

31:57.920 --> 32:00.920
And if you look at where that highly effective gene is found,

32:00.920 --> 32:02.920
what you see is a rather wonderful map like this.

32:02.920 --> 32:06.920
Those of us in Western Europe are very, very likely to have this,

32:06.920 --> 32:08.920
what's called a high affinity gene.

32:08.920 --> 32:13.920
People who have a long-standing African ancestry, much less so.

32:13.920 --> 32:18.920
And the explanation for this is that that's because the evolutionary history in Africa

32:18.920 --> 32:21.920
was hunter-gatherer for much, much longer.

32:21.920 --> 32:24.920
Those of us in Europe have been through this agricultural bottleneck.

32:24.920 --> 32:28.920
We are the survivors of people who farmed in the Middle East, essentially.

32:28.920 --> 32:31.920
And so in order to survive farming in the Middle East,

32:31.920 --> 32:35.920
you needed this version of the gene to help you get nutrients out of your food,

32:35.920 --> 32:36.920
otherwise you died.

32:36.920 --> 32:40.920
And so those of us who have survived that process have that high affinity gene

32:40.920 --> 32:44.920
because it's able to scavenge ergyffioning from your food.

32:44.920 --> 32:48.920
A very nice example, I think, of where agriculture has shaped modern genomes

32:48.920 --> 32:51.920
in a way that we had not previously predicted.

32:52.920 --> 32:54.920
And in fact, we can go one step further than this

32:54.920 --> 32:56.920
because we can say, so this is testing an individual gene,

32:56.920 --> 32:58.920
but we can turn it around and we can say,

32:58.920 --> 33:03.920
what is it in modern humans that apparently has evolved very, very fast?

33:03.920 --> 33:06.920
And a very neat way to do that was done by David Reichs group

33:06.920 --> 33:11.920
who looks at relatively recently dead human beings.

33:11.920 --> 33:15.920
And when I say relatively recently, I mean the last 6,000 years, more or less.

33:15.920 --> 33:22.920
And they sequence DNA from corpses from about 6,500 years ago to about 300 years ago.

33:22.920 --> 33:25.920
So this is quite a big swave of human evolution.

33:25.920 --> 33:31.920
By doing that, you can look at genes that have essentially not changed over that period of time

33:31.920 --> 33:34.920
versus those that are apparently changing very, very fast.

33:34.920 --> 33:38.920
And the theory is that a gene that is important for something that is changing

33:38.920 --> 33:40.920
will itself change.

33:40.920 --> 33:42.920
So if you think about, for example, dealing with an infection,

33:42.920 --> 33:46.920
your genes are changing fast as the infectious profile changes,

33:46.920 --> 33:51.920
whereas the way that you pattern an embryo has not changed over the last 6,000 years.

33:51.920 --> 33:54.920
So those genes are not evolving very fast.

33:55.920 --> 33:58.920
So what you see in front of you is a graph of the whole human genome

33:58.920 --> 34:01.920
from chromosome 1 right down here to chromosome 22.

34:02.920 --> 34:06.920
Every gene, each 20,000-ish genes of the human genome has been looked at,

34:06.920 --> 34:09.920
and the question is how fast are those genes changing.

34:09.920 --> 34:12.920
What you see is the vast majority of genes are not changing very much at all,

34:12.920 --> 34:15.920
and that makes sense, right, because most of what it means to be human

34:15.920 --> 34:17.920
has not changed over the last 6,000 years.

34:17.920 --> 34:20.920
But you have these occasional genes, the tall ones here,

34:20.920 --> 34:23.920
that are evolving very, very fast indeed.

34:23.920 --> 34:29.920
These are genes that do something that has changed a lot over the last 6,500 years.

34:29.920 --> 34:31.920
And one of the very nice things about this analysis

34:31.920 --> 34:34.920
is that one of these genes is that one I just talked about,

34:34.920 --> 34:36.920
the ergithionine transporter.

34:36.920 --> 34:39.920
So you can see that gene here, it has a terrible name,

34:39.920 --> 34:41.920
but nonetheless you can see that gene is one of these

34:41.920 --> 34:44.920
that is significantly evolving faster than chance.

34:45.920 --> 34:47.920
But there are some other neat ones here,

34:47.920 --> 34:50.920
and this one clearly is the one that is evolving the fastest,

34:50.920 --> 34:53.920
and this one is the one that affects all of us today.

34:53.920 --> 34:57.920
So if you're sitting here listening to this scoffing your late night cereal

34:57.920 --> 35:00.920
with a bowl of milk, then you can thank this gene for that.

35:00.920 --> 35:02.920
If you're sitting here listening to this saying,

35:02.920 --> 35:04.920
I wish I could have that bowl of milk, but it would make me sick,

35:04.920 --> 35:09.920
you can blame this gene for that, because this is the lactase persistence gene.

35:09.920 --> 35:14.920
And this is a very nice example of evolution, shaping evolution.

35:14.920 --> 35:17.920
Because, as you will know, those of you in particular

35:17.920 --> 35:20.920
who've got domestic pets, cats, dogs, et cetera,

35:20.920 --> 35:24.920
the basic rule for all mammals is that baby mammals drink milk,

35:24.920 --> 35:26.920
and big mammals don't, right?

35:26.920 --> 35:28.920
If you have a puppy, a puppy drinks milk,

35:28.920 --> 35:31.920
when you wean the puppy and have an adult dog,

35:31.920 --> 35:33.920
if you give your adult dog a bowl of milk,

35:33.920 --> 35:35.920
it will vomit it all back up again, okay?

35:35.920 --> 35:37.920
And that is true for most mammals.

35:37.920 --> 35:39.920
It is also historically true for humans.

35:39.920 --> 35:44.920
Historically, evolutionarily, humans could also not consume milk as adults.

35:44.920 --> 35:46.920
We would drink milk as babies, we would wean,

35:46.920 --> 35:49.920
and then we would become what's called lactose intolerant,

35:49.920 --> 35:52.920
because you would miss the enzyme to digest it.

35:53.920 --> 35:56.920
That was not a problem, until we started dairying,

35:56.920 --> 36:00.920
we started keeping cattle and sheep and other things for their milk.

36:00.920 --> 36:05.920
And then it became quite useful to be able to digest that milk even as an adult.

36:05.920 --> 36:09.920
There is a mutation that is presumably quite rare in nature

36:09.920 --> 36:12.920
that keeps that gene on into adulthood.

36:12.920 --> 36:16.920
And for the last million years or so, that's been totally irrelevant.

36:16.920 --> 36:19.920
But suddenly when we started to have a ready source of milk as adults,

36:19.920 --> 36:21.920
having that version of the gene was very beneficial.

36:21.920 --> 36:25.920
And the time it was particularly beneficial was when times got really tough.

36:25.920 --> 36:29.920
So, for example, in winter when there's no food around,

36:29.920 --> 36:32.920
you were essentially on the brink of starvation.

36:32.920 --> 36:37.920
If you had a cow and you could drink that milk and not vomit it back up again,

36:37.920 --> 36:39.920
you had a significant chance of survival.

36:39.920 --> 36:42.920
If you drank it and threw it back up again and got no calories from it,

36:42.920 --> 36:43.920
that was not helpful.

36:43.920 --> 36:47.920
And so what we see here is the very, very strong selective pressure

36:47.920 --> 36:51.920
to have this version of the gene that allows us to metabolise milk.

36:51.920 --> 36:53.920
And for those of you who listen to this thing,

36:53.920 --> 36:54.920
yeah, but I'm lactose intolerant.

36:54.920 --> 36:57.920
I'm sorry, you're one of these people down here who have got the older version of the gene

36:57.920 --> 37:02.920
that is not conferring that ability to drink milk as an adult.

37:02.920 --> 37:06.920
So this is an example where we have done something, we have evolved dairying,

37:06.920 --> 37:11.920
and it has shaped our own genetic evolution quite dramatically.

37:11.920 --> 37:15.920
And the other example you can see here is a whole cluster of genes down here,

37:15.920 --> 37:19.920
which is all the different functions that they are all to do with the immune system.

37:19.920 --> 37:21.920
And I said right at the beginning of this lecture

37:21.920 --> 37:25.920
that one of the strongest forces in immunity is infectious disease,

37:25.920 --> 37:29.920
because it kills people and in particular it kills young people before they have reproduced.

37:29.920 --> 37:35.920
And so we should expect genes that confer resistance to disease to be evolving fast,

37:35.920 --> 37:36.920
and they are.

37:36.920 --> 37:40.920
So there are genes here that are evolving very, very fast.

37:40.920 --> 37:44.920
And one of the reasons they have evolved particularly fast over the last few thousand years

37:44.920 --> 37:49.920
is because we ourselves have dramatically increased the risk of infection.

37:49.920 --> 37:52.920
And we've done that by living very close to each other,

37:52.920 --> 37:55.920
we're all here in a fairly crowded hall for starters,

37:55.920 --> 37:57.920
able to spread diseases quite well,

37:57.920 --> 38:01.920
but also because we have brought into our lives things that spread diseases to us,

38:01.920 --> 38:06.920
either deliberately or inadvertently, like this rather cute fluffy thing here for example,

38:06.920 --> 38:12.920
rats, mice, the fleas they bring, the parasites they bring are often damaging to humans.

38:13.920 --> 38:19.920
And so that onset of urbanisation and agriculture exposed us to new diseases.

38:19.920 --> 38:23.920
And in particular one of the diseases of course that they brought,

38:23.920 --> 38:25.920
that these animals brought with them,

38:25.920 --> 38:29.920
that has been enormously influential in human evolution is this one here.

38:29.920 --> 38:32.920
This is the bacteria that causes the bubonic plague.

38:32.920 --> 38:37.920
And this as you will probably know is carried by, the bacteria is carried by fleas,

38:37.920 --> 38:39.920
the fleas live on rodents.

38:39.920 --> 38:43.920
So getting exposed to those fleas on either your pets

38:43.920 --> 38:46.920
or more likely your rodents that live in your house

38:46.920 --> 38:49.920
is the route by which you pick up bubonic plague.

38:50.920 --> 38:53.920
It is very likely that bubonic plague has been around for a long time,

38:53.920 --> 38:57.920
but it was a very minor evolutionary pressure when we were hunter-gatherers

38:57.920 --> 39:01.920
because A, you didn't often come into contact with these things carrying it,

39:01.920 --> 39:05.920
and B, even if you did, you were only living in a band of a few people,

39:05.920 --> 39:09.920
even if it wiped out your tribe, it was not a major impact in terms of evolution.

39:09.920 --> 39:13.920
When you start to live in a town or a village or a city of thousands of people,

39:13.920 --> 39:16.920
now you have the opportunity to have proper pandemic plague

39:16.920 --> 39:19.920
and a very significant evolutionary impact

39:19.920 --> 39:22.920
because as we know only too well over the last few years,

39:22.920 --> 39:25.920
disease spreads fast in crowded conditions.

39:26.920 --> 39:29.920
And we know from very good historical data

39:29.920 --> 39:33.920
that the magnitude of the impact of these bubonic plagues

39:33.920 --> 39:35.920
has been quite astronomical.

39:36.920 --> 39:38.920
So, for example, this is a picture of the plague of Ash Dodd,

39:38.920 --> 39:40.920
which we don't actually know if that happened, but nonetheless,

39:40.920 --> 39:45.920
but we do know from good contemporary historical data,

39:45.920 --> 39:49.920
for example, that the plague of Justinian at the end of the Roman Empire

39:49.920 --> 39:51.920
swept around the coastline of the Mediterranean

39:51.920 --> 39:54.920
and multiple historians from that time

39:54.920 --> 39:57.920
tell us that it killed about one in four people.

39:57.920 --> 39:59.920
And bearing in mind, this is the Roman Empire,

39:59.920 --> 40:03.920
this is the sort of centre of the global universe at that point.

40:03.920 --> 40:05.920
So 25% of the people in the Mediterranean

40:05.920 --> 40:07.920
was a big chunk of the world's population

40:07.920 --> 40:10.920
who died within just a couple of years.

40:10.920 --> 40:12.920
And then much closer to home, we're here in London,

40:12.920 --> 40:14.920
those of us in the hall at least,

40:14.920 --> 40:17.920
and we will all be very familiar with the impact of the black death in Europe,

40:17.920 --> 40:21.920
the same disease, different name, same disease, same bacteria.

40:21.920 --> 40:25.920
In particular, the black death which peaked around 1350,

40:25.920 --> 40:27.920
at least in this part of the world,

40:27.920 --> 40:29.920
is estimated to have wiped out

40:29.920 --> 40:33.920
between 30% and 60% of the population of Europe.

40:33.920 --> 40:35.920
So this is an enormous mortality,

40:35.920 --> 40:38.920
a really, really strong selective force.

40:38.920 --> 40:41.920
And so it stands to reason that the slightest advantage

40:41.920 --> 40:45.920
would actually be a really, really big advantage in evolutionary terms.

40:45.920 --> 40:49.920
Even if your chance of survival was 1% better than the guy next door,

40:49.920 --> 40:51.920
over that kind of level of scale

40:51.920 --> 40:55.920
that's going to be visible in our evolution.

40:55.920 --> 40:58.920
And it turns out that that is indeed true.

40:58.920 --> 41:01.920
And so there is an absolutely fantastic study

41:01.920 --> 41:03.920
done by Elias Berreiro, which I really love,

41:03.920 --> 41:06.920
which uses an amazing historical resource

41:06.920 --> 41:08.920
just down the road from here.

41:08.920 --> 41:13.920
So down at East Smithfield, just by Tarra London here,

41:13.920 --> 41:17.920
in 1348, Edward III, who was king at the time,

41:17.920 --> 41:20.920
was hiding well away from the plague, very sensible,

41:20.920 --> 41:24.920
but watching London be decimated by plague,

41:24.920 --> 41:26.920
he was very astute bit of biology.

41:26.920 --> 41:29.920
Edward III thought this is not very good to have dead plague victims everywhere.

41:29.920 --> 41:31.920
What I'll do is I'll buy a big lump of land,

41:31.920 --> 41:34.920
I will dig a big hole, and I will tell my soldiers

41:34.920 --> 41:38.920
to throw anyone who dies of the plague into that pit,

41:38.920 --> 41:40.920
which is at East Smithfield.

41:40.920 --> 41:43.920
And then by about 1350, the plague is over in London,

41:43.920 --> 41:45.920
they cover over those dead bodies,

41:45.920 --> 41:47.920
and a very astute bit of government there,

41:47.920 --> 41:49.920
well, let's not waste this resource,

41:49.920 --> 41:51.920
it's a little bit like HS2 in this country,

41:51.920 --> 41:53.920
let's not waste this resource.

41:53.920 --> 41:54.920
We've got a big pit.

41:54.920 --> 41:57.920
I know we'll put other people in it now when they die on top.

41:57.920 --> 42:00.920
So what you have in East Smithfield is a layer,

42:00.920 --> 42:02.920
a layer of people who died of the plague,

42:02.920 --> 42:05.920
and then above it, a layer of people who survived the plague

42:05.920 --> 42:07.920
and died of something else a couple of years later.

42:07.920 --> 42:09.920
And that is an amazing genetic tool

42:09.920 --> 42:12.920
because you can look at the DNA of those different layers

42:12.920 --> 42:16.920
and say, what are the genes that made you susceptible to the plague

42:16.920 --> 42:17.920
when you're in the bottom layer,

42:17.920 --> 42:21.920
or helps you resist the plague and you're in the top layer?

42:21.920 --> 42:23.920
And when you do that, you find them.

42:23.920 --> 42:24.920
It's fantastic.

42:24.920 --> 42:25.920
So here we have a plot,

42:25.920 --> 42:27.920
just like the one I showed you of all the genes,

42:27.920 --> 42:29.920
and the ones up the top are the genes

42:29.920 --> 42:32.920
that are significantly overrepresented in the survivors.

42:32.920 --> 42:34.920
So if you had that version of the gene,

42:34.920 --> 42:37.920
you were much more likely to make it through the plague.

42:37.920 --> 42:39.920
You might have got run over by a horse the following year and died,

42:39.920 --> 42:41.920
but you didn't get the plague and died.

42:41.920 --> 42:44.920
So they were advantageous in helping you to survive.

42:44.920 --> 42:47.920
For example, CTA4 or the ERAP genes there.

42:47.920 --> 42:52.920
Unsurprisingly, these genes are all to do with immunity.

42:52.920 --> 42:56.920
So, for example, the ERAP genes are used to reveal to the immune system

42:56.920 --> 42:58.920
the presence of a pathogen.

42:58.920 --> 43:02.920
Having those helped, presumably, these medieval Londoners to say,

43:02.920 --> 43:05.920
oh my goodness, immune system, there's a bubonic plague happening here

43:05.920 --> 43:08.920
to deal with it fast and help me survive.

43:08.920 --> 43:11.920
So that version of the gene helped them survive

43:11.920 --> 43:13.920
against the plague all those years ago,

43:13.920 --> 43:16.920
and we can see that evolution today.

43:16.920 --> 43:20.920
But the last twist to this tale, and perhaps a slightly miserable point to end on,

43:20.920 --> 43:23.920
is that this gene, having these genes, is why we're all here today,

43:23.920 --> 43:26.920
especially those of you who have long-distant London ancestors.

43:26.920 --> 43:31.920
The reason you're alive today is because your great-grandparents

43:31.920 --> 43:34.920
had this version of the gene and survived the plague.

43:34.920 --> 43:37.920
Unfortunately, you've now got this version of the gene,

43:37.920 --> 43:40.920
and that's probably also the reason if you're sitting there rubbing your knuckles

43:40.920 --> 43:42.920
that you have rheumatoid arthritis.

43:42.920 --> 43:47.920
Because it turns out that this gene is really good at triggering the immune system against plague.

43:47.920 --> 43:50.920
Unfortunately, it's also a bit good at triggering it when you don't need to

43:50.920 --> 43:55.920
and inducing autoimmune diseases like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.

43:55.920 --> 43:59.920
So what you end up with is a gene that was massively advantageous a long time ago,

43:59.920 --> 44:02.920
now, unfortunately, having a bit of a negative consequence.

44:02.920 --> 44:05.920
Of course, the really bad news is, as I said at the beginning,

44:05.920 --> 44:08.920
evolution works on reproduction.

44:08.920 --> 44:13.920
So it's really important to be resistant to plague and have your babies grow up.

44:13.920 --> 44:16.920
By the time you get rheumatoid arthritis, most of us have done our reproduction.

44:16.920 --> 44:18.920
It doesn't impact at all on our ability to reproduce,

44:18.920 --> 44:20.920
and so evolution doesn't see this,

44:20.920 --> 44:23.920
and so you're going to be stuck with this gene probably forever now

44:23.920 --> 44:26.920
because there's no evolutionary pressure to remove it again for the population.

44:26.920 --> 44:28.920
Bad luck, but that's evolution for you.

44:28.920 --> 44:30.920
Thank you very much. I'm very happy to take questions.

44:30.920 --> 44:35.920
APPLAUSE

44:35.920 --> 44:37.920
OK, so for those listening online, can you hear that?

44:37.920 --> 44:39.920
How has modern medicine changed evolution?

44:39.920 --> 44:41.920
Well, I'm going to be really mean and say, stick around,

44:41.920 --> 44:44.920
because the next lecture, we're going to talk a bit about that,

44:44.920 --> 44:47.920
but I'll give you a quick spoiler alert.

44:47.920 --> 44:52.920
So the short answer is, it is probably too soon to see anything particularly dramatic,

44:52.920 --> 44:59.920
but there are some very nice examples of where we will very soon, I think, see evolutionary impacts.

44:59.920 --> 45:02.920
And probably the biggest one is around reproduction,

45:02.920 --> 45:07.920
because things like IVF, of course, have just changed this beautiful model I've shown you about.

45:07.920 --> 45:09.920
It's all about how successful you are at reproducing,

45:09.920 --> 45:12.920
because now you can reproduce if you actually couldn't reproduce previously,

45:12.920 --> 45:16.920
or indeed you can choose not to reproduce even though you're biologically capable,

45:16.920 --> 45:18.920
which is something that has not happened for millions of years

45:18.920 --> 45:22.920
and is undoubtedly going to reshape evolution in some really interesting ways.

45:22.920 --> 45:23.920
And that's all I'm going to say.

45:23.920 --> 45:25.920
You'll have to tune in for the next lecture to find out some more.

45:25.920 --> 45:28.920
I'm going to go to question online, then I come to the audience.

45:28.920 --> 45:30.920
We have a whole series of questions,

45:30.920 --> 45:33.920
which I think are kind of points of clarification about genetics, yes?

45:33.920 --> 45:38.920
People are asking questions about how lactose intolerance genes

45:38.920 --> 45:41.920
change their expression over the life course,

45:41.920 --> 45:46.920
and whether, if you're lactose intolerant,

45:46.920 --> 45:48.920
it means that one of your parents is lactose intolerant.

45:48.920 --> 45:51.920
So they're just some people who want some clarification on those points.

45:51.920 --> 45:52.920
Yeah, very good point.

45:52.920 --> 45:54.920
So, and I just slightly brush over that.

45:54.920 --> 45:56.920
So how does the lactose gene work?

45:56.920 --> 45:58.920
So essentially you have a gene, lactase,

45:58.920 --> 46:01.920
which helps you digest milk sugars, lactose.

46:01.920 --> 46:05.920
If you can't digest the sugar, it makes you sick and you vomit it back up again.

46:05.920 --> 46:10.920
So having that enzyme expressed produced is critical to be able to digest milk.

46:10.920 --> 46:13.920
Genes work, you have the thing that you're making, so that enzyme,

46:13.920 --> 46:16.920
and what's called a promoter sequence beside it,

46:16.920 --> 46:20.920
which tells the body when to put that protein into production, when to turn it off.

46:20.920 --> 46:23.920
So, for instance, there are some proteins that have produced

46:23.920 --> 46:26.920
at different times of the menstrual cycle if you're female,

46:26.920 --> 46:28.920
or when you go into adolescence or so on and so forth.

46:28.920 --> 46:32.920
You don't want the gene for beards being turned on when you're six months old.

46:32.920 --> 46:34.920
You only want it when you're in puberty.

46:34.920 --> 46:38.920
And so those promoters are if you like the timer.

46:38.920 --> 46:42.920
Lactase, this enzyme, has a timer which says,

46:42.920 --> 46:46.920
turn me off forever as soon as you've finished, you know,

46:46.920 --> 46:49.920
as soon as you've weaned, as soon as you've finished drinking milk from your mother.

46:49.920 --> 46:52.920
And that works brilliantly well in all animals, including ourselves.

46:52.920 --> 46:55.920
What we have done at some point in the evolutionary time

46:55.920 --> 46:57.920
is there has been a mutation that has broken that switch,

46:57.920 --> 47:00.920
and it stays on forever.

47:00.920 --> 47:04.920
No use at all, in fact, possibly slightly disadvantageous

47:04.920 --> 47:07.920
because you're making approaches of no relevance,

47:07.920 --> 47:10.920
up until the point when you start being exposed to milk as an adult,

47:10.920 --> 47:12.920
then massively, massively important.

47:12.920 --> 47:13.920
So that's how it works.

47:13.920 --> 47:14.920
And the question about inheritance.

47:14.920 --> 47:16.920
So there are two sorts actually of lactase intolerance.

47:16.920 --> 47:17.920
I should have made that clear.

47:17.920 --> 47:19.920
The clean genetic type is that.

47:19.920 --> 47:21.920
So if you don't have the enzyme, you can't digest the sugar,

47:21.920 --> 47:23.920
you're lactase intolerant.

47:23.920 --> 47:26.920
There are secondary issues, for example, allergies to milk,

47:26.920 --> 47:28.920
which are nothing to do with that enzyme,

47:28.920 --> 47:32.920
and are to do with whether you've been stimulated by a particular antigen,

47:32.920 --> 47:33.920
so on and so forth.

47:33.920 --> 47:36.920
So I guess the cautionary tale here is don't be listening to this at home

47:36.920 --> 47:39.920
and thinking, oh, actually, my milk allergy is all nonsense.

47:39.920 --> 47:40.920
I don't have that gene.

47:40.920 --> 47:41.920
I'm going to go and drink milk.

47:41.920 --> 47:43.920
If you've been told your milk allergic, don't drink milk.

47:43.920 --> 47:45.920
Okay, regardless of whether you have this gene or not.

47:45.920 --> 47:46.920
So there are different systems.

47:46.920 --> 47:49.920
But yes, if you are genetically lactase intolerant,

47:49.920 --> 47:54.920
then whether your children are or not depends on the gene of your partner too.

47:54.920 --> 47:57.920
Because if your partner is lactase tolerant and they're lucky,

47:57.920 --> 47:58.920
they'll get that gene and not yours.

47:58.920 --> 48:02.920
Then on the lactose, my cat loves a nice drop of milk,

48:02.920 --> 48:05.920
or yogurt, or cheese, or whatever.

48:05.920 --> 48:09.920
And the story I've always heard is they became domesticated

48:09.920 --> 48:13.920
when we took up dairy and they killed the mice and the rats in the dairy.

48:13.920 --> 48:17.920
So is there something about cats that enables them to drink milk as adults?

48:17.920 --> 48:20.920
So the question is about cats and cats that drink milk in particular

48:20.920 --> 48:21.920
and how they got domesticated.

48:21.920 --> 48:23.920
And this sort of reminds me of that thing about,

48:23.920 --> 48:25.920
you know, you should never work in television with children or pets, right?

48:25.920 --> 48:27.920
You should never answer questions about cats.

48:27.920 --> 48:31.920
So the domestication of cats is actually a bit enigmatic.

48:31.920 --> 48:33.920
I mean, we know it's quite early on.

48:33.920 --> 48:35.920
And as anyone who owns a cat knows,

48:35.920 --> 48:38.920
it's a bit unclear whether we domesticated them or they domesticated us.

48:38.920 --> 48:41.920
Either way, they are now living with us.

48:41.920 --> 48:46.920
So some cats are better at drinking milk than others.

48:46.920 --> 48:47.920
So there's some variation there.

48:47.920 --> 48:48.920
And I have to say, I don't know,

48:48.920 --> 48:51.920
be interested now if anyone online listening to this can post in the chat,

48:51.920 --> 48:55.920
whether they know whether that's because of the same sort of mutation or not.

48:55.920 --> 48:57.920
Cheese, you mentioned about eating cheese.

48:57.920 --> 49:01.920
So when you process milk into something, particularly hard cheeses,

49:01.920 --> 49:04.920
actually the lactose is largely destroyed

49:04.920 --> 49:06.920
because the fermentation process gets rid of that,

49:06.920 --> 49:09.920
which is why people who are lactose intolerant usually can eat cheese,

49:09.920 --> 49:11.920
but not drink raw milk.

49:11.920 --> 49:13.920
So it depends a bit on the amount of lactose, too.

49:15.920 --> 49:16.920
Okay, there's a question.

49:16.920 --> 49:18.920
Again, I'm going to oscillate it.

49:18.920 --> 49:20.920
Again, I'm trying to put together some questions here.

49:20.920 --> 49:25.920
There are lots of people thinking about what future evolutionary pressures are likely to be.

49:25.920 --> 49:28.920
They're talking about changes in diet, changes in obesity.

49:28.920 --> 49:32.920
Somebody's mentioned that in Southeast Asia around Polynesia.

49:32.920 --> 49:34.920
People have also said,

49:34.920 --> 49:36.920
well, if you have all these pressures, modern-day pressures,

49:36.920 --> 49:40.920
how does that play out now that there are fewer generations per century?

49:40.920 --> 49:43.920
Because we are reproducing older,

49:43.920 --> 49:46.920
and so where as we would have three or four generations a century ago,

49:46.920 --> 49:48.920
now we only have two.

49:48.920 --> 49:50.920
So that's very interesting.

49:50.920 --> 49:51.920
I'm going to take the second part first.

49:51.920 --> 49:54.920
So the question is about whether evolution is running at, again,

49:54.920 --> 49:58.920
a different clock speed, I guess, if we reproduce more slowly, which we do now.

49:58.920 --> 50:01.920
And the short answer is yes, generally it's true.

50:01.920 --> 50:04.920
So evolution is measured on generational time.

50:04.920 --> 50:09.920
So if you have, I don't know, 20 generations of 1,000 years or 15,

50:09.920 --> 50:11.920
that makes a difference to the clock rate.

50:11.920 --> 50:14.920
So to a first approximation, evolution is running more slowly.

50:14.920 --> 50:19.920
The slight caveat to that is that it's also about the mutation rate in your DNA.

50:19.920 --> 50:22.920
And as you get older, if you reproduce at older ages,

50:22.920 --> 50:25.920
you carry more mutations, sorry to say, but it's true.

50:25.920 --> 50:30.920
So there is a higher chance, I guess, of variability in your offspring.

50:30.920 --> 50:32.920
That is not enough to compensate for the change.

50:32.920 --> 50:34.920
So it's not that it will stay static.

50:34.920 --> 50:36.920
We are still essentially evolving slightly more slowly,

50:36.920 --> 50:40.920
but it's not a linear change in that kind of rate.

50:40.920 --> 50:43.920
And in terms of the question about what's going to happen in the future,

50:43.920 --> 50:45.920
I'm going to have a trailer for the next one.

50:45.920 --> 50:47.920
I think there are lots of interesting things.

50:47.920 --> 50:52.920
My teenage kids would tell me that a key skill for reproducing these days

50:52.920 --> 50:54.920
would be able to use TikTok.

50:54.920 --> 50:58.920
So maybe there will be a genetic selection for good use of TikTok.

50:58.920 --> 50:59.920
I don't know.

50:59.920 --> 51:02.920
But there are lots of things that will change.

51:02.920 --> 51:05.920
For example, through most of human history,

51:05.920 --> 51:08.920
being able to wield a weapon and kill your opponents

51:08.920 --> 51:10.920
was quite a big selective force.

51:10.920 --> 51:14.920
Happily, for most of us today, that's not a big selective force.

51:14.920 --> 51:17.920
So even weegee people like me can successfully reproduce

51:17.920 --> 51:19.920
because I haven't been attacked by someone with a sword.

51:19.920 --> 51:21.920
Happily thus far, that's what I would.

51:21.920 --> 51:26.920
I was just wondering, could you maybe argue that the most healthy diet is a paleo diet,

51:26.920 --> 51:28.920
but then with a bit of milk and carbs?

51:29.920 --> 51:34.920
And then the other thing was in reference to the question of the man behind me

51:34.920 --> 51:40.920
about healthcare, could you maybe argue that with the onset of the industrial revolution,

51:40.920 --> 51:46.920
the infant mortality rate has decreased from 50% to 1% less than 1%

51:46.920 --> 51:49.920
and that's caused maybe quite a lot of mutation

51:49.920 --> 51:53.920
and therefore we've maybe become more unhealthy as a population?

51:54.920 --> 51:56.920
So there's a lot in those questions.

51:56.920 --> 51:58.920
So going in reverse order,

51:58.920 --> 52:03.920
so unfortunately infant mortality rate globally today is still at about 5% or 6%,

52:03.920 --> 52:07.920
so that is good in the sense that it has fallen from highs of,

52:07.920 --> 52:12.920
if you look historically, it was not unusual to lose half your children before the age of 5, for example.

52:12.920 --> 52:14.920
So we've done quite well, I would argue,

52:14.920 --> 52:17.920
this is an awfully long way to go, 5% is still a very big number.

52:17.920 --> 52:20.920
So there is something about that.

52:20.920 --> 52:23.920
In terms of the industrial revolution, I think that depends very much.

52:23.920 --> 52:28.920
So seeing an evolutionary fingerprint of that would be difficult, I think,

52:28.920 --> 52:30.920
because it was not even, right?

52:30.920 --> 52:32.920
So there were indeed people who lived in,

52:32.920 --> 52:36.920
so for example smog resistance might have been quite important, having good lungs,

52:36.920 --> 52:40.920
it would have been important if you were in the middle of smoggy Manchester or London or something,

52:40.920 --> 52:44.920
but actually a large part of the population was not exposed to that even during the industrial revolution

52:44.920 --> 52:47.920
and so many of us will not have been through that selective pressure,

52:47.920 --> 52:49.920
so I think that would be quite hard to see.

52:49.920 --> 52:52.920
In terms of the best, I make it a point of principle,

52:52.920 --> 52:55.920
never to advise people on the best possible diet,

52:55.920 --> 52:58.920
but if I was to say it, so I think it's very tricky to say,

52:58.920 --> 53:00.920
you know, the paleo diet is sort of attractive,

53:00.920 --> 53:03.920
because I said hunter-gatherers had this better nutritional profile.

53:03.920 --> 53:08.920
That is, of course, at a time when the switch was to subsistence agriculture

53:08.920 --> 53:11.920
in a very different way than it is now.

53:11.920 --> 53:13.920
Most of us, even people who grow your own,

53:13.920 --> 53:16.920
you know, we're actually fortunately at very low risk of starving to death

53:16.920 --> 53:19.920
because you can still always get down the road to the supermarket if you need to.

53:19.920 --> 53:22.920
And so I think the idea that you just kind of roll back the clock

53:22.920 --> 53:25.920
and go back to kind of a stone-age paleo diet and everything will be well

53:25.920 --> 53:28.920
is a bit simplistic.

53:28.920 --> 53:31.920
That, notwithstanding, there are certainly things about that diet

53:31.920 --> 53:36.920
that would be useful advice for people like having fresh fruit and nuts and, you know, fibre.

53:36.920 --> 53:40.920
We know is infinitely sensible and so that's kind of worth considering,

53:40.920 --> 53:42.920
but I would caution against someone thinking,

53:42.920 --> 53:46.920
let me live as a stone-age man and everything will be perfect.

53:46.920 --> 53:52.920
How could mRNA vaccines affect and present in our genome and long-term health?

53:52.920 --> 53:57.920
And what negative side effects could there be that we don't commonly speak about?

53:57.920 --> 53:58.920
Oh, that's an interesting question.

53:58.920 --> 54:01.920
I said mRNA vaccines, which we're all familiar with.

54:01.920 --> 54:05.920
So the clever thing about mRNA vaccines is they don't integrate into your genomes.

54:05.920 --> 54:08.920
They produce a protein, but they don't get inherited.

54:08.920 --> 54:13.920
So if, like me, and hopefully, like all of you, you've been vaccinated quite possibly with an mRNA vaccine,

54:13.920 --> 54:15.920
you're not going to pass it on to your kids.

54:15.920 --> 54:17.920
It's not inherited in any way.

54:17.920 --> 54:20.920
It is a transient, if you like, process.

54:20.920 --> 54:22.920
I think there's a sort of second part to the question there,

54:22.920 --> 54:28.920
which is theoretically you could do something that is stably inherited that might be useful.

54:28.920 --> 54:30.920
So, for example, you could tweak people's immune system.

54:30.920 --> 54:33.920
So one thing you could do right is you could go back to those genes that we know

54:33.920 --> 54:35.920
have protected against bubonic plague and you could say,

54:35.920 --> 54:41.920
well, maybe we should kind of change those in the genome of people who don't have that version to make them more resistant.

54:41.920 --> 54:46.920
There are very plausible reasons that you might want to do that for kind of infectious disease purposes.

54:46.920 --> 54:50.920
I think the rheumatoid arthritis example is a good caution against that.

54:50.920 --> 54:55.920
Of course, you might do something for all the best intentions to change in one way,

54:55.920 --> 55:01.920
but you need to be very, very cautious about the unintended consequences about unleashing some secondary effect there.

55:01.920 --> 55:08.920
In terms of the question itself, mRNA vaccines definitely don't affect your genome in terms of any inherited way.

55:08.920 --> 55:09.920
Actually, I'm a huge fan.

55:09.920 --> 55:13.920
I think they're a massively exciting technology that has been hugely beneficial for COVID-19

55:13.920 --> 55:16.920
and hopefully will be for lots of other things in the future.

55:16.920 --> 55:19.920
We'll talk a little bit about that in next year's series.

55:19.920 --> 55:24.920
So if you're really keen to come back, see you in 2025 and we'll talk about those.

55:24.920 --> 55:29.920
The map you showed at the beginning with the hybridisation events showed one in Australia.

55:29.920 --> 55:35.920
Does that mean that earlier it formed a human reach Australia and so which ones?

55:35.920 --> 55:39.920
Australia is like cats, a very contentious topic.

55:39.920 --> 55:46.920
So in terms of interbreeding, what we know definitively is that homo sapiens interbreed

55:46.920 --> 55:51.920
with Neanderthals in Europe and with Denisovans in essentially Siberia.

55:51.920 --> 55:54.920
Everything else is not known in terms of integration.

55:54.920 --> 55:59.920
There is a little bit of evidence about some interbreeding with a mysterious species that we don't know yet.

55:59.920 --> 56:01.920
That's still far from determined.

56:01.920 --> 56:09.920
The arrival of ancient humans in Australia is a massively contested date, which is a wildly variable.

56:09.920 --> 56:13.920
As far as I know, although I'm happy to be corrected by those listening online or those in the room,

56:13.920 --> 56:16.920
there's no evidence for specific interbreeding in that region.

56:16.920 --> 56:21.920
Actually, the entire question of who arrived in Australia when is strongly contested.

56:21.920 --> 56:28.920
One of the most interesting things just in the last few weeks is the whole genome data on native Australian populations.

56:28.920 --> 56:33.920
There is very interesting, very high levels of diversity in those Aboriginal populations,

56:33.920 --> 56:37.920
which is very interesting in terms of their dynamics.

56:37.920 --> 56:43.920
For example, it looks like different groups did not mix that radically early on in the history of Australia.

56:43.920 --> 56:49.920
I think there's an untapped interesting science question there about the human evolution within Australia.

56:49.920 --> 56:53.920
That doesn't answer your question about meeting with other groups outside of it, though.

56:53.920 --> 56:58.920
I think we have time for two questions. I want to take one question here and then I'll come to you for the last question because you've had to hand up.

56:58.920 --> 57:10.920
Some people are really interested in language when you've showed the Fox P2 and how language conferred potentially at sort of an advantage reproductively.

57:10.920 --> 57:20.920
But they've kind of extended it forward in their questions to ask how culture and human culture and art and potentially even religion

57:20.920 --> 57:24.920
may have imprinted on our genome and had selection pressures.

57:24.920 --> 57:28.920
Another brilliant question, and again, I feel like some kind of, you know, I keep saying, you know,

57:28.920 --> 57:33.920
follow me for the next exciting one because in a future lecture, we will talk a little bit about that kind of cultural evolution,

57:33.920 --> 57:36.920
but let me talk a bit about that now. So language, absolutely.

57:36.920 --> 57:42.920
I think language is kind of one of those interesting places where it's not quite as obvious as survival advantages like fighting off infection

57:42.920 --> 57:45.920
or, you know, growing good and true or whatever.

57:45.920 --> 57:48.920
But it's probably, it's less culturally, there's something more intrinsic, right?

57:48.920 --> 57:52.920
If you can't speak, if you can't communicate, it is quite difficult to reproduce.

57:52.920 --> 57:54.920
So that's in that high of a place.

57:54.920 --> 58:00.920
I absolutely think that culture itself will also select, and we know anecdotally, right, about certain things.

58:00.920 --> 58:05.920
Historically, if you were the wrong religion, your chance of successful reproduction was a lot lower

58:05.920 --> 58:07.920
because you might have been burned at the stake or whatever.

58:07.920 --> 58:12.920
But usually, those periods are relatively brief, evolutionarily speaking.

58:12.920 --> 58:19.920
I'd be kind of surprised if you could see enough genetics, for example, around religious belief or cultural belief,

58:19.920 --> 58:23.920
because they're so short and they're so localised, but I'm always happy to be proven wrong.

58:23.920 --> 58:31.920
And who knows in the future we might discover, you know, some strong genetic factor for religious conformity or something.

58:31.920 --> 58:33.920
Final question, I think.

58:33.920 --> 58:36.920
Very interesting lecture. I really appreciate it.

58:36.920 --> 58:47.920
I'm not a medical qualified, I'm not a physicist, but the impression, again, is that modern medical science is causing us to defy evolution, evolutionary pressures.

58:47.920 --> 58:54.920
Do you think we're in the long term able to keep up with evolution of viruses and bacteria

58:54.920 --> 58:59.920
so that we'll always have a solution to whatever falls us?

58:59.920 --> 59:03.920
That's a high-pressure question to end on, isn't it? Will we survive forever?

59:03.920 --> 59:09.920
So, rather than defy evolution, I would say we are certainly changing it so happily, right?

59:09.920 --> 59:14.920
So many of the things that killed babies 300 years ago are not a big worry to us, at least here in Western Europe.

59:14.920 --> 59:18.920
And that's a great thing. It clearly changes the evolutionary impact.

59:18.920 --> 59:21.920
I think the idea that we've somehow stepped off the evolutionary matter, though, is a mistake.

59:21.920 --> 59:26.920
There are other pressures now. There are lots of other things that influence whether we reproduce and whether our kids reproduce,

59:26.920 --> 59:29.920
for example, cultural things, and they will play a role, too.

59:29.920 --> 59:35.920
I'm pretty optimistic, generally, about the opportunity for medicine to deal with big disasters,

59:35.920 --> 59:39.920
and we've seen, happily, a very strong response to Covid-19.

59:39.920 --> 59:43.920
Am I optimistic that we'll be able to do that forever? Not so much.

59:43.920 --> 59:48.920
Historically, most species come to an end at some point.

59:48.920 --> 59:51.920
The only question is, is it going to be in 100 years or a million years?

59:51.920 --> 59:54.920
Voting, well, I guess 100, I'm still going to be gone. It doesn't really matter.

59:54.920 --> 59:58.920
But, you know, let's aim towards a million, at least. That'd be good.

59:58.920 --> 01:00:03.920
And on that positive note, I'd just like to thank Professor May again.

01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:06.920
Your next lecture is when, and that's going to be...

01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:10.920
That's a good question. It's about four or five weeks time, I think, and we're going to be answering some of the questions

01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:14.920
that you asked tonight, actually, about the impact of society, human impact,

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:18.920
things like antibiotics, disease resistance, and where we might all go from here.

01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:22.920
So, come back again, find out more, have more of your questions answered.

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:24.920
Thank you again.
