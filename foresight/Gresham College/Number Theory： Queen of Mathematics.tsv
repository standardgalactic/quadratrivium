0	7000	Welcome to Gresham College, and to this book launch of my number theory, a very short introduction.
7000	16000	It's one of the latest in the popular series of very short introductions, which Oxford University Press has produced over the past 25 years.
16000	27000	I was also fortunate to have been invited to write the very short introduction to combinatorics, which appeared in 2016.
28000	38000	I've always been interested in the history of mathematics, and in the book and in this lecture you'll meet four of the prime figures who feature throughout my story.
38000	50000	The Greek mathematician Euclid of Alexandria top right, who wrote his classic text The Elements in the third century BC, and who probably didn't look like this.
50000	58000	Pierre Fermat, on the left, a lawyer in southern France in the early 17th century.
58000	66000	Leonard Euler, an 18th century Swiss mathematician who was probably the most prolific mathematician of all time,
66000	75000	and Carl Friedrich Gauss, a German mathematician who published a classic text on number theory in the year 1801.
76000	84000	It was Gauss who claimed that mathematics is the queen of the sciences, and number theory is the queen of mathematics.
84000	88000	So what is number theory?
88000	96000	Basically, it's the branch of mathematics that's primarily concerned with our ordinary counting numbers 1, 2, 3, etc.
96000	99000	Sometimes called the positive integers.
99000	105000	And it's concerned with whether they're odd or even, or are perfect squares or cubes,
105000	114000	or can be divided exactly by seven or some other number, or have some other such property.
114000	120000	Particularly important throughout the subject of the prime numbers, which we can think of as the building blocks of the subject,
120000	128000	like atoms in chemistry, and which are the only numbers whose only factors are itself and one.
128000	136000	For example, 11, 13, 17 and 19 are all prime, we can't split them up into factors.
136000	144000	But 15 and 18 are not, because 15 is three times five, and 18 is two times nine,
144000	148000	which we can then write as two times three times three.
148000	157000	But we must be careful, because some numbers that look as though they might be prime numbers, such as 91 and 323 are not,
157000	163000	because 91 is seven times 13, and 323 is 17 times 19.
163000	167000	So it's not always easy to spot whether a given number is prime.
167000	172000	For example, how about the three numbers at the bottom of the screen?
172000	178000	I'll tell you about these ones later on.
178000	182000	So here are some of the questions that I'll be talking about today.
182000	189000	The first ones are clearly about numbers, such as whether that last number is prime,
189000	193000	whether any number made entirely of ones is a perfect square,
193000	198000	and various problems arising from the calendar.
198000	205000	But number theory also expands into other areas, such as the geometry of right-angled triangles,
205000	208000	and the construction of regular shapes.
209000	213000	You'll also see applications to the shuffling of cards,
213000	218000	and even to more practical matters, such as the security of your credit cards,
218000	224000	which is based on a result on prime numbers that dates back to the 18th century.
224000	230000	Number theory, once an abstract branch of pure mathematics that was studied for its own sake,
230000	237000	is now also central to the study of cryptography and to other subjects of practical importance.
238000	242000	So here are the subjects I'll be talking about today.
242000	247000	First, prime numbers. How many are there? How are they distributed?
247000	250000	And how do they arise in geometry?
250000	255000	Next, perfect squares. How can we recognise them?
255000	258000	What do they tell us about right-angled triangles?
258000	262000	And I'll also show you two results related to Fermar.
263000	268000	Third is clock arithmetic and the mathematics of the calendar.
268000	274000	And finally, yet another result of Fermar is generalisation by Euler,
274000	279000	and applications to the counting of necklaces, the shuffling of cards,
279000	284000	and, as promised, protecting your credit cards.
284000	287000	And if you find any of these topics too technical,
287000	292000	just hold on as I'll soon switch back to more straightforward topics.
296000	298000	So let's start with prime numbers.
298000	302000	Here's a table of the primes up to 100.
302000	307000	It's been produced by an ancient Greek method called the sieve of eratosnes,
307000	311000	where we first list all the numbers up to 100,
311000	316000	then cross out the multiples of 2, that is 4, 6, 8, etc.
316000	322000	Then the multiples of 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, etc.
322000	325000	Actually, 6 and 12 have already been crossed out.
325000	329000	Then those are 5, and then 7,
329000	332000	until we get the numbers that appear in yellow here.
332000	335000	These are the primes.
335000	339000	You may ask why one isn't a prime.
339000	343000	The answer relies on a fundamental property of our number system,
343000	348000	that we can get every number by multiplying primes together.
348000	353000	For example, 60 is 2 times 2 times 3 times 5,
353000	356000	and that this can be done in only one way,
356000	359000	apart from the order that the primes appear.
359000	364000	So we could have written 60 as 2 times 5 times 3 times 2,
364000	366000	or some other order,
366000	371000	but there must always be 2 2s, 1 3 and 1 5.
371000	374000	But if we took 1 to be a prime,
374000	377000	we could then write 6 as 2 times 3,
377000	379000	or 2 times 3 times 1,
379000	383000	or 2 times 3 times 1 times 1, and so on.
383000	388000	We'd lose this fundamental property of factorisation into primes in only one way.
388000	390000	That would be a great loss,
390000	395000	so we choose to make 1 not a prime.
396000	400000	But we can never list all the primes because the list goes on forever.
400000	403000	But how would we prove this?
403000	405000	Unfortunately, given any prime,
405000	408000	there's no rule for listing the next one.
408000	413000	For example, what's the next prime after 997?
413000	417000	It's not at all obvious that it's 109.
417000	420000	But Euclid, in his book The Elements,
420000	422000	came up with a very different approach.
422000	426000	Here it is in the earliest surviving copy of The Elements
426000	430000	from AD 888 in the Bodleian Library in Oxford.
433000	436000	And here's an English version of Euclid's proof.
436000	439000	The thing to note is that it's a geometric argument.
439000	444000	Instead of numbers, he used the lengths of various lines.
444000	448000	So how did his proof go?
448000	451000	Here it is in modern language.
451000	455000	Let's make the assumption that the list does not go on forever,
455000	457000	and that these are the only primes.
457000	462000	We've called them P1, P2, P3 and so on up to Pn.
462000	465000	We're assuming there are no others.
465000	469000	We'll now create a new number by multiplying them all together
469000	471000	and adding one.
471000	474000	And we'll call this capital N.
474000	479000	Then each of our primes divides the quantity in brackets,
479000	482000	the product, and so none of them can divide the number N,
482000	486000	which is got by adding one to it.
486000	489000	So what can we say about N?
489000	492000	Because it's not divisible by any of our primes,
492000	495000	it must itself be a new prime,
495000	498000	or possibly be made up of new primes.
498000	501000	So in either case, there's a new prime,
501000	505000	and this contradicts our assumption that we've listed all of the primes.
505000	508000	So our assumption must have been wrong.
508000	510000	We cannot list all the primes,
510000	513000	and so the list must go on forever.
513000	517000	Incidentally, both of these possibilities for N can occur.
517000	520000	If the only primes that we knew were 2, 3, 5 and 7,
520000	524000	then N would be their product, that's 210 plus 1,
524000	526000	which is 211,
526000	530000	and this is a prime that we didn't have before.
530000	534000	But if the only primes that we knew were the ones up to 13,
534000	537000	then multiplying them together and adding one
537000	540000	to N is 30,031,
540000	544000	which actually isn't prime, it's 59 times 509,
544000	548000	so here we get two new primes we didn't have before.
551000	554000	But we can say more.
554000	557000	We can adapt Euclid's proof to prove that the list of primes
557000	561000	of the four N plus three goes on forever.
561000	565000	These are the primes which have three more than a multiple of four,
565000	568000	such as three itself,
568000	571000	or seven, which is four plus three,
571000	575000	or eleven, which is two fours plus three, and so on.
575000	579000	So these are all primes of the four and four N plus three.
581000	583000	We can also prove that there are infinitely many primes
583000	586000	that are one more than a multiple of four.
586000	589000	The primes of the four and four N plus one, such as five,
589000	591000	that's four plus one,
591000	594000	thirteen, three fours plus one,
594000	598000	and seventeen, four fours plus one, and so on.
598000	602000	So there are infinitely many primes of the four and four N plus one,
602000	605000	and four N plus three.
605000	609000	But we obviously can't say the same for numbers of the four and four N plus two,
609000	612000	because these numbers are all even,
612000	616000	and so none of them can be prime apart from two itself.
617000	620000	And the general result along these lines
620000	624000	was proved by the German mathematician Lejeune Dirichlet
624000	626000	in 1837.
626000	628000	In this tour de force,
628000	632000	he showed that there are infinitely many primes of the four N plus B
632000	635000	for any numbers A and B,
635000	639000	as long as A and B have no factors in common.
639000	642000	This result was, and still is,
642000	645000	extremely difficult to prove.
645000	649000	But it includes the cases four N plus one and four N plus three,
649000	653000	because four has no factors in common with one or three.
656000	660000	And if we now take A to be ten and B to be nine,
660000	662000	which also have no factors in common,
662000	668000	we see there are infinitely many primes of the four and ten N plus nine.
668000	672000	That is infinitely many prime numbers ending with nine.
673000	675000	And in the same way,
675000	679000	there are infinitely many prime numbers ending with one,
679000	681000	or with three,
681000	683000	or with seven.
687000	689000	Let's now turn to something different.
689000	693000	Numbers that are one less than a power of two.
693000	696000	They're named after Mariam Meir Sen,
696000	698000	a French mathematician and friar
698000	701000	who investigated them in the 17th century.
703000	706000	If we look at these Meir Sen numbers,
706000	709000	we'll see that some of them are prime.
709000	712000	Two squared minus one is three.
712000	715000	Two cubed minus one is seven.
715000	718000	Two to the fifth minus one is 31.
718000	722000	And two to the seventh minus one is 127.
722000	725000	And these are all primes.
725000	728000	But other Meir Sen numbers are not prime.
728000	732000	Two to the fourth minus one is 15, which isn't prime.
732000	735000	And two to the sixth minus one is 63.
735000	738000	Two to the eighth minus one is 255.
738000	741000	And two to the ninth minus one is 511.
741000	744000	And none of these is prime.
745000	748000	So looking at the powers of two that appear here,
748000	754000	it's very tempting to believe that two to the N minus one is always prime
754000	757000	when the exponent, the power N, is prime.
757000	759000	Here they're two, three, five and seven.
759000	764000	And that it's never prime when the exponent N isn't prime.
764000	768000	And here they're four, six, eight and nine.
768000	771000	But is this always the case?
773000	775000	The answer is partly.
775000	778000	It's not difficult to show that if N is not prime,
778000	782000	then two to the N minus one isn't prime either.
782000	787000	But if N is prime, we have to be more careful.
787000	790000	For example, if we take the next prime, 11,
790000	796000	we have two to the 11 minus one, which is 2047.
796000	799000	Now this may look prime, but it isn't.
799000	801000	It's 23 times 89.
801000	807000	So if N is prime, then two to the N minus one may or may not be prime.
807000	813000	Mersen himself came up with a list of primes of this form,
813000	816000	which is why they're named after him.
816000	819000	He made a few false claims and he left out a couple of them,
819000	822000	but it was an impressive list for the time,
822000	827000	especially because he correctly included two to the 127 minus one,
827000	830000	which is a prime number with 39 digits.
833000	835000	So why are these numbers of interest,
835000	838000	or are they simply a curiosity?
838000	841000	It turns out that if we're looking for new primes,
841000	845000	then Mersen primes turn out to be our best bet.
845000	848000	For example, the last 17 primes that have been found
848000	851000	have all been of this kind,
851000	856000	including the most recently discovered one in December 2018,
856000	864000	which is two to the 82,589,933 minus one,
864000	868000	a prime number with almost 25 million digits.
871000	874000	But another reason for looking at Mersen primes
874000	877000	is that they turn up in connection with a problem
877000	879000	that dates from ancient Greek times.
881000	883000	The Greeks were interested in numbers,
883000	885000	which they called perfect numbers,
885000	890000	whose factors, apart from the number itself, add up to the original number.
891000	896000	For example, six is perfect because it's factors of one, two and three,
896000	899000	and these add up to six.
899000	905000	And 28 is perfect because it's factors of one, two, four, seven and fourteen,
905000	908000	and these add up to 28.
910000	913000	The next two, also known to the Greeks,
913000	917000	were 496 and 8128,
917000	925000	and then there aren't any more of them until 33,550,366.
927000	930000	So how did the Greeks find these perfect numbers?
932000	936000	To see why they found them, let's factorise them.
936000	939000	We find that six is two times three,
939000	944000	which we can write as two to the one times two squared minus one.
945000	949000	28 is four times seven, which we can write as two squared,
949000	952000	times two cubed minus one.
953000	956000	496 is 16 times 31,
956000	961000	which is two to the fourth times two to the fifth minus one.
962000	967000	8128 is 64 times 127,
967000	971000	which is two to the sixth times two to the seventh minus one.
972000	978000	And the other one, 33,550,336,
978000	982000	is 4,096 times 8,191,
982000	986000	which is two to the twelfth times two to the thirteenth minus one.
986000	988000	So in each case, it's a power of two,
988000	992000	multiplied by a mercen prime, in fact, the next one.
993000	995000	Well, all of this is known to Euclid,
995000	998000	whose book, The Elements, includes a proof
998000	1001000	that the product of two to the n minus one
1001000	1006000	and two to the n minus one is a perfect number,
1006000	1009000	as long as the second of these numbers is prime.
1010000	1014000	The next question is, does this give us all the perfect numbers?
1015000	1017000	2,000 years after Euclid,
1017000	1022000	then did Euler prove that every even perfect number is of Euclid's type?
1023000	1026000	But are there any odd perfect numbers?
1027000	1031000	Euler didn't know, and nor indeed does anyone.
1032000	1036000	If there are any odd perfect numbers,
1036000	1041000	there'll be absolutely huge, more than 10 to the power of 1,500,
1041000	1045000	so they probably don't exist, but who knows?
1048000	1053000	Before we leave prime numbers, let's explore one more type.
1053000	1056000	This time introduced by Fermat.
1058000	1062000	Instead of looking at prime numbers of the form 2 to the n minus one,
1062000	1066000	let's consider primes of the form 2 to the n plus one.
1067000	1074000	It turns out that these can be prime only when n is itself a power of two,
1074000	1076000	two to the two to the n plus one.
1076000	1078000	So let's look at some of these.
1079000	1082000	Fermat found the first few.
1082000	1085000	Two to the one plus one, which is three.
1087000	1090000	Two to the two plus one, which is five.
1091000	1094000	Two to the four plus one, which is 17.
1095000	1098000	Notice that the exponents are powers of two.
1099000	1103000	Two to the eighth plus one is 257,
1103000	1109000	and two to the sixteenth plus one, which is 65,537.
1110000	1113000	Fermat noticed that these are all prime,
1113000	1118000	and he made the conjecture that every number of this form must be prime.
1120000	1124000	So the next one to test is two to the 32 plus one.
1124000	1126000	Is that prime?
1127000	1131000	Well, unfortunately, it's a ten digit number over four billion,
1131000	1134000	and Fermat's pocket calculator didn't go that far.
1135000	1139000	So Fermat never found out whether his conjecture was true or not.
1142000	1145000	But once again, Leonard Euler came to the rescue.
1146000	1150000	After doing many calculations, he discovered that two to the 32 plus one
1150000	1155000	can be evenly divided by 641.
1157000	1160000	And later he found a method that gave this answer more quickly.
1160000	1165000	But even Euler was stuck with the next one, two to the 64th plus one,
1165000	1170000	which was a 20 digit number, which also turns out not to be prime.
1171000	1174000	But its smallest prime factor is over 200,000,
1174000	1177000	so it's not surprising that Euler missed it.
1178000	1180000	But worse was to come.
1180000	1183000	Many other Fermat numbers are now known,
1183000	1186000	and none of them has turned out to be prime.
1186000	1190000	So Fermat's conjecture has turned out to be rather an unfortunate one.
1194000	1198000	But all is not lost as Fermat primes turned up again,
1198000	1203000	but in the most unexpected place, the drawing of regular polygons.
1203000	1207000	These are polygons where all the size and all the angles are equal.
1209000	1213000	The ancient Greeks were very interested in trying to construct these,
1213000	1218000	whereby constructing, they allow themselves to use only an unmarked ruler,
1218000	1222000	no measuring allowed, and a pair of compasses.
1224000	1228000	Here's how Euclid constructed an equilateral triangle.
1229000	1232000	Starting with a line AB,
1233000	1237000	use the compasses to draw the circle on the left,
1237000	1240000	where the centre is A and the radius is AB.
1240000	1243000	So that gives you the left-hand circle.
1244000	1248000	Then draw the circle on the right by taking the centre to be B,
1248000	1250000	and the radius is BA.
1252000	1254000	And then you have two circles.
1254000	1257000	These two circles intersect at the point C.
1260000	1263000	Now the length AB is the same as AC
1263000	1266000	because each is a radius of the left-hand circle,
1266000	1269000	and the length BA is equal to the length BC
1269000	1272000	because each is a radius of the right-hand circle,
1272000	1276000	so all three sides are equal, and we have an equilateral triangle.
1280000	1283000	And constructing a regular hexagon is even easier.
1285000	1290000	Draw a circle with centre O and some radius OA.
1290000	1293000	Then with a compass point A and the same radius,
1293000	1296000	mark off the point B on the circle.
1298000	1301000	Then with a compass point B and the same radius,
1301000	1303000	mark off the point C,
1303000	1307000	and then in the same way the points D, E and F.
1308000	1310000	And if you join these six points together,
1310000	1312000	that gives us a regular hexagon.
1312000	1314000	What other polygons can we draw?
1315000	1318000	Euclid also showed how to construct a square
1318000	1323000	and a regular pentagon using just an unmarked rule and compasses,
1324000	1326000	and he also showed how to double the number of sides
1326000	1328000	of a regular polygon.
1328000	1331000	So starting with an equilateral triangle,
1331000	1333000	with three sides,
1333000	1335000	we can draw a regular hexagon,
1335000	1338000	and we can draw a regular hexagon.
1338000	1341000	The triangle, with three sides,
1341000	1346000	we can construct regular polygons with six, 12 and 24 sides.
1347000	1350000	And starting with a square, then doubling,
1350000	1355000	we can construct regular polygons with eight, 16 and 32 sides.
1355000	1357000	And starting with a regular pentagon,
1357000	1362000	we can construct ones with 10, 20 and 40 sides.
1363000	1367000	And also by combining the constructions for three and five sides,
1367000	1371000	Euclid constructed a regular polygon with 15 sides.
1372000	1375000	But neither Euclid nor anyone else
1375000	1378000	was able to construct regular polygons
1378000	1383000	with seven, nine, 11, 13, 14, 18 or 19 sides.
1385000	1387000	Are any of these possible?
1388000	1390000	Enter Gauss.
1391000	1393000	When ageed only 18,
1393000	1398000	he first showed how to construct a regular polygon with 17 sides.
1400000	1403000	He then answered the construction question completely
1403000	1406000	by proving a remarkable result.
1407000	1410000	That a regular polygon with n sides
1410000	1413000	can be constructed by ruler and compasses
1413000	1419000	if and only if n is obtained by taking some power of two
1419000	1423000	multiplied by unequal Fermat primes,
1423000	1426000	which is I remind you of the five listed here.
1428000	1432000	So for example, we can construct polygons with 30 sides
1433000	1437000	because 30 is two times three times five.
1438000	1442000	We can do 32 sides because that's the power of two
1442000	1446000	or 34 sides because that's two times 17
1447000	1451000	or 40 sides because that's two cubed times five.
1453000	1457000	But we cannot construct regular polygons with 35 sides
1457000	1462000	because 35 is five times seven and seven is not allowed.
1463000	1468000	Or 36 sides because 36 is two squared times three squared
1468000	1471000	and we're not allowed to use three twice.
1472000	1475000	Or 37, which is not a Fermat prime anyway,
1475000	1479000	or 100 because the factor five occurs twice.
1480000	1484000	So to answer the question I mentioned at the beginning,
1484000	1488000	we cannot draw a regular polygon with 100 sides,
1488000	1493000	but it's remarkable that these Fermat primes occur in such a problem.
1497000	1500000	Let's now leave prime numbers for a while
1500000	1503000	and look at perfect squares.
1504000	1507000	The first 10 of these are listed here.
1507000	1511000	One squared is one, two squared is four,
1511000	1515000	three squared is nine, and so on.
1516000	1522000	And you notice that none of these squares ends with two, three, seven or eight.
1523000	1528000	And this is true in general because if we square in a larger number like 27,
1528000	1532000	it must end with the same digit as if we'd squared seven.
1533000	1538000	So no perfect square can end in two, three, seven or eight.
1540000	1543000	One interesting result about perfect squares
1543000	1546000	is if we add up the first few positive odd numbers,
1546000	1549000	then we always get a square.
1549000	1551000	One is one squared.
1551000	1555000	One plus three is four, which is two squared.
1555000	1560000	One plus three plus five is nine, which is three squared, and so on.
1561000	1564000	We can prove this quite easily by arithmetic,
1564000	1568000	but more informative is this geometric picture,
1568000	1572000	which was supposedly known to the Pythagoreans of Ancient Greece,
1572000	1574000	that shows why it's true.
1574000	1577000	Here each L shape has an odd number of dots,
1577000	1581000	one dot, three dot, five dots, seven dots, and so on.
1581000	1585000	And they all fit together to make a perfect square.
1586000	1593000	We also notice that every square is either a multiple of four, such as 16,
1593000	1598000	or is one more than the multiple of four, such as 25.
1599000	1604000	No perfect square has a form four n plus two or four n plus three.
1606000	1611000	And this is because if n is even, say it's twice k,
1612000	1616000	then n squared is four times something.
1616000	1620000	And if n is odd, equal to two k plus one, say,
1620000	1625000	then n squared is four times something plus one.
1626000	1630000	So numbers made up entirely of ones, such as 11,
1630000	1636000	111, 111, and so on, cannot be perfect squares,
1636000	1640000	because they are all three more than a multiple of four,
1640000	1642000	and that's not allowed.
1645000	1648000	Another nice result is if n is odd,
1648000	1652000	then its square must be one more than a multiple of eight.
1652000	1655000	And we can see this from our earlier result.
1655000	1657000	If n is two k plus one,
1657000	1662000	then n squared is four times k times k plus one plus one.
1663000	1668000	But k times k plus one is the product of two consecutive numbers.
1669000	1672000	And if you had two consecutive numbers, one must be odd,
1672000	1674000	and the other must be even.
1674000	1680000	So that product is even, giving us eight times something plus one.
1682000	1685000	But a much more attractive way of illustrating this result
1685000	1687000	is to draw a picture like the one here.
1688000	1691000	Where there are eight triangles of dots,
1691000	1694000	plus an extra one in the middle.
1694000	1697000	So in this case, we have nine squared dots,
1697000	1701000	are made of eight lots of ten dots, plus one,
1701000	1704000	and so has the form eight n plus one.
1704000	1707000	And this works whatever number n is.
1708000	1710000	Perfect squares also feature prominently
1710000	1713000	in the geometry of right-angled triangles.
1715000	1716000	From our school days,
1716000	1719000	we remember the Pythagorean theorem,
1719000	1722000	which was probably not due to Pythagoras himself,
1722000	1725000	and was originally a result about areas.
1726000	1729000	But it tells us that if A, B, and C are equal,
1729000	1731000	then they are equal,
1731000	1734000	and they are equal,
1734000	1737000	but it tells us that if A, B, and C are the lengths
1737000	1739000	of the sides of a right-angled triangle,
1739000	1743000	with C the longest side, or hypotenuse,
1743000	1747000	then A squared plus B squared equals C squared.
1749000	1752000	And today I'm interested in when these side lengths
1752000	1754000	are all whole numbers,
1755000	1758000	such as the 3, 4, 5 triangle,
1758000	1762000	where 3 squared plus 4 squared is 5 squared.
1762000	1765000	That's 9 plus 16 is 25.
1767000	1770000	The 5, 12, 13 right-angled triangle
1770000	1774000	with 5 squared plus 12 squared is 13 squared.
1774000	1778000	25 plus 144 is 169.
1780000	1783000	And the 15, 8, 17 triangle
1783000	1787000	with 15 squared plus 8 squared is 17 squared.
1787000	1790000	Well, 225 plus 64 is 289.
1791000	1793000	What are the examples are there,
1793000	1796000	and can we find them all?
1797000	1799000	Well, we can easily get more examples
1799000	1802000	by scaling out the size of these triangles.
1802000	1805000	For example, from the 3, 4, 5 triangle,
1805000	1810000	we can scale up by 10 to get a 30, 40, 50 triangle
1810000	1814000	with 30 squared plus 40 squared is 50 squared.
1814000	1817000	Or from 3, 4, 5 we can scale up by 2
1817000	1819000	to get a 6, 8, 10 triangle
1819000	1823000	with 6 squared plus 8 squared equals 10 squared.
1824000	1826000	But these scaling aren't very interesting,
1826000	1829000	so we'll assume that no scaling have taken place
1829000	1833000	and that A, B and C have no common factors.
1834000	1836000	And in fact, we can assume that any two of them
1836000	1838000	have no common factor because any such factor
1838000	1841000	will then have to divide the third.
1842000	1846000	So we can assume that A and B cannot both be even.
1848000	1851000	We can also assume that they cannot both be odd
1851000	1854000	because then A squared and B squared
1854000	1857000	would be one more than a multiple of four.
1858000	1861000	So that C squared would be two more than a multiple of four
1861000	1864000	and squares cannot be two more than a multiple of four
1864000	1866000	as we've seen.
1866000	1868000	So one of A, B and C is odd
1868000	1872000	and the other is even, as in our first examples.
1872000	1874000	Three and four, one odd, one even,
1874000	1878000	five and 12, 15 and eight, one odd, one even.
1882000	1886000	And to be definite, we'll always take A to be odd
1886000	1888000	and B to be even.
1888000	1890000	Well, by using similar arguments
1890000	1892000	which I won't go into,
1892000	1894000	we can eventually prove that A, B and C
1894000	1896000	have the forms shown here
1896000	1899000	for some whole numbers X and Y.
1899000	1903000	A is X squared minus Y squared,
1903000	1905000	B is two XY
1905000	1908000	and C is X squared plus Y squared.
1910000	1912000	You can check that with these expressions
1912000	1915000	A squared plus B squared is indeed C squared.
1915000	1919000	And moreover, we can show that X is greater than Y,
1919000	1921000	that X and Y have no common factors
1921000	1924000	and that one is even and the other is odd.
1925000	1927000	So let's see some examples of this.
1927000	1929000	Here's what we had before.
1929000	1931000	A has this form, X squared minus Y squared,
1931000	1934000	B is two XY, C is X squared plus Y squared
1934000	1937000	where X and Y have these properties.
1938000	1941000	So let's take some examples for X and Y.
1941000	1943000	If X is two and Y is one,
1943000	1947000	then A is two squared minus one squared which is three.
1948000	1951000	B is two times two times one which is four
1951000	1954000	and C is two squared plus one squared which is five.
1954000	1958000	So we get the right angle triangle with size three, four, five.
1961000	1963000	If X is three and Y is two,
1963000	1966000	then A is three squared minus two squared which is five,
1966000	1969000	B is two times three times two which is 12
1969000	1972000	and C is three squared plus two squared which is 13
1972000	1976000	and we get the triangle with size five, 12, 13.
1978000	1980000	And if X is five and Y is two,
1980000	1984000	then A is five squared minus two squared which is 21,
1984000	1987000	B is two times five times two which is 20
1987000	1991000	and C is five squared plus two squared which is 29
1991000	1997000	and we get the right angle triangle with size 21, 20 and 29.
1998000	2001000	And using these formulas we can compile a list
2001000	2005000	that would eventually include all right angle triangles.
2008000	2011000	Now earlier I asked for all right angle triangles
2011000	2015000	with a side of length 29 and we just found one.
2016000	2020000	As we've just seen by taking X to be five and Y to be two,
2020000	2024000	we found the triangle with size 21, 20 and 29.
2025000	2027000	But are there any others?
2029000	2031000	Well because 29 is a prime number,
2031000	2034000	the size can have no common factor
2034000	2038000	and so we can again use expressions for A, B and C
2038000	2040000	when there's no scaling involved.
2041000	2047000	But 29 cannot be two X, Y cannot be B because that's even.
2048000	2053000	And so 29 must either be C which is X squared plus Y squared
2053000	2057000	or 29 must be A which is X squared minus Y squared.
2060000	2063000	But if 29 is X squared plus Y squared,
2063000	2066000	then the only possibility is X is five and Y is two
2066000	2068000	and we had the solution we had before.
2070000	2073000	And if 29 is X squared minus Y squared,
2073000	2077000	we can factorize that into two factors as shown here.
2077000	2080000	And because 29 is prime,
2080000	2083000	one of those factors must be 29 and the other must be one.
2084000	2088000	So X plus Y is 29, X minus Y is one
2088000	2093000	and we can solve those equations to give X is 15 and Y is 14.
2095000	2099000	It then follows that A is 15 squared minus 14 squared
2099000	2101000	which is 29 as we expected.
2102000	2107000	B is two times 15 times 14 which is 420
2108000	2112000	and C is 15 squared plus 14 squared which is 421.
2114000	2117000	So this is the only other right-angled triangle
2117000	2120000	with a side of length 29.
2120000	2125000	Sides of 29, 420 and 421.
2125000	2128000	Those are the only two right-angled triangles
2128000	2130000	with 29 as one of the sides.
2135000	2136000	Before we leave perfect squares,
2136000	2139000	I'd like to show you a couple of results named after Fermat.
2142000	2144000	In our study of right-angled triangles,
2144000	2146000	we've been looking at sums of two squares
2147000	2150000	and we might ask what numbers can be written
2150000	2152000	as the sum of two squares.
2153000	2159000	For example, 41 is 5 squared plus 4 squared
2160000	2163000	but 42 cannot be written as the sum of two squares.
2166000	2167000	How do we look at this?
2167000	2170000	Well, because all squares have the form 4n or 4 plus 1,
2170000	2175000	4n plus 1, the sum of two squares must be of the form 4n
2176000	2181000	or 4n plus 1 which is got by adding a 4n and a 4n plus 1
2181000	2185000	or 4n plus 2 adding two of those odd numbers.
2186000	2190000	So we can rule out any numbers of the form 4n plus 3 such as 43.
2193000	2197000	We notice also that sums of squares in more than one way.
2198000	2204000	For example, 65 is 64 plus 1 but it's also 49 plus 16.
2206000	2209000	It turns out that we can deal with the general question
2209000	2212000	of which numbers can be written as the sum of two squares
2212000	2217000	if we can first decide which prime numbers are the sum of two squares.
2219000	2222000	We've just ruled out all the primes of the form 4n plus 3
2224000	2228000	but as claimed by Fermat and later proved by Euler,
2228000	2233000	every prime number of the form 4n plus 1 can be written as the sum of two squares.
2235000	2238000	Moreover, this can happen in only one way.
2239000	2241000	So here are some examples.
2241000	2245000	5 is a prime of the form 4n plus 1.
2245000	2247000	5 is 4 plus 1.
2248000	2251000	13 is 9 plus 4.
2252000	2255000	17 is 16 plus 1.
2256000	2260000	29 is 25 plus 4.
2261000	2267000	41 is 25 plus 16 and you can make up some more for yourself.
2268000	2273000	But it's a remarkable result proved all those years ago by Euler
2273000	2275000	and conjectured by Fermat.
2278000	2282000	But the other result of Fermat I want to mention is his famous last theorem
2282000	2285000	because it was the last of his theorems to be proved.
2286000	2289000	This is a very famous result in mathematics.
2292000	2294000	When we're looking at right-angled triangles,
2294000	2299000	we found positive numbers a, b and c with a squared plus b squared is c squared.
2300000	2305000	But what about higher powers such as cubes or fourth powers?
2305000	2311000	Can we find positive numbers a, b and c with a squared plus b squared equals c
2311000	2314000	with a cubed plus b cubed equals c cubed
2315000	2318000	or a to the fourth plus b to the fourth is c to the fourth.
2319000	2325000	Fermat himself found an ingenious argument to show that there are no solutions for the fourth powers.
2326000	2331000	In his method of infinite descent, he showed that if there were a solution,
2331000	2335000	it would give rise to another solution with smaller numbers.
2336000	2341000	And then that in turn would give rise to yet another solution with yet smaller numbers and so on forever.
2341000	2345000	But you can't keep on reducing the numbers forever and ever.
2345000	2348000	So the original equation couldn't have had a solution.
2351000	2358000	Now Fermat believed that there are no positive number solutions to a to the n plus b to the n is c to the n
2358000	2361000	for any power n larger than 2.
2362000	2367000	And he claimed to have a truly marvellous proof but the margin is too small to present it.
2369000	2374000	I too have a truly marvellous proof but this lecture is too short for me to give it to you.
2376000	2380000	In any case, Fermat's conjecture was eventually proved in 1995,
2380000	2389000	350 years after he first mentioned it by Andrew Wiles then at Princeton University and now at Oxford.
2395000	2398000	Let's now leave squares and look at some clock arithmetic.
2399000	2406000	If it's nine o'clock and six hours pass, then it's three o'clock.
2406000	2411000	So we can write nine plus six is three.
2411000	2416000	And writing mod twelve reminds us that we're using a twelve hour clock.
2417000	2424000	Similarly, if it's ten o'clock and seven hours pass, then it's five o'clock.
2424000	2429000	So ten plus seven is five mod twelve.
2431000	2435000	It actually turns out to be more convenient to write zero rather than twelve.
2435000	2440000	So eight plus four is twelve o'clock.
2440000	2443000	In other words, eight plus four is zero mod twelve.
2445000	2449000	This way of calculating is called modular arithmetic or clock arithmetic
2449000	2454000	and is introduced by Gauss in his number theory book of 1801.
2455000	2461000	More generally, we say that A is the same as B mod n
2461000	2465000	if A and B leave the same remainder when divided by n.
2467000	2473000	So fifteen, nine plus six is fifteen, fifteen is three mod twelve
2473000	2476000	because they leave the same remainder when you divide by twelve.
2476000	2479000	And seventeen is five mod twelve.
2479000	2484000	And another way of saying this is that A minus B can be divided by n.
2486000	2489000	Gauss worked out all the rules for this type of arithmetic.
2490000	2494000	But we don't have to stick to arithmetic mod twelve.
2494000	2497000	We can also use it for the seven days of the week.
2497000	2502000	For example, if it's Thursday, then in four days it would be Monday.
2503000	2508000	And if it's Saturday, then in three days it would be Tuesday.
2509000	2515000	If we number the days of the week from day zero Sunday, day one is Monday,
2515000	2520000	up to day six, which is Saturday, we can then write these statements
2520000	2526000	as Thursday plus four days is Monday, four plus one is one mod seven.
2527000	2532000	Saturday plus three days is Tuesday, six plus three is two mod seven.
2535000	2541000	Well, using this idea, we can carry out calculations on the calendar.
2542000	2545000	Several people have produced methods for finding the day of the week
2545000	2548000	for a given date, including Gauss himself
2549000	2553000	and also the mathematician John Conway, who died earlier this year.
2554000	2559000	Here's a method devised by Charles Dodgson, better known as Lewis Carroll,
2559000	2562000	the author of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,
2562000	2565000	and it was published under his pen name.
2565000	2569000	So let's see how it works in detail, first quickly in general
2569000	2573000	and then more slowly for a specific date.
2573000	2575000	So let's have a look at this.
2578000	2581000	Carroll's method is based on four numbers,
2581000	2584000	which are then added mod seven.
2585000	2587000	The first number is the century number.
2588000	2590000	What century we in?
2590000	2593000	To find this, we divide the first two digits of the year,
2593000	2596000	in our case 20, by four,
2597000	2601000	subtract the remainder from three and double the result.
2603000	2605000	Next is the year number.
2605000	2610000	Here Carroll's rule is to divide the last two digits of the year by 12,
2610000	2613000	and then add the quotient, the remainder,
2613000	2616000	and the number of times that four divides into the remainder.
2616000	2619000	You'll see how this works in a minute.
2621000	2625000	Third is the month number, where Carroll gave a complicated rule,
2625000	2628000	but it's easier just to memorise this table of numbers.
2629000	2633000	And last is the day number, which is just the day of the month.
2634000	2637000	And there's also an extra condition which we won't need today.
2637000	2641000	So let's see how this works in practice.
2641000	2643000	And if it seems rather complicated,
2643000	2648000	Carroll himself claimed to be able to apply it in his head in around 20 seconds.
2650000	2652000	So let's see how it works for today's date,
2652000	2656000	the 28th of September 2020, as you can see on the right.
2656000	2658000	So here the general method is on the left,
2658000	2661000	and we'll work through it, and the example is on the right.
2661000	2667000	For the century number, we take the first two digits of the year.
2667000	2671000	The year is 2020, so the first two digits are 20,
2671000	2677000	and divide it by four, giving a remainder of zero.
2677000	2682000	Subtracting this remainder zero from three gives three,
2682000	2685000	and doubling the result gives six.
2685000	2687000	So six is our century number.
2687000	2693000	For the year number, we take the last two digits of the year,
2693000	2695000	which is also 20 for 2020,
2695000	2700000	divide it by 12, giving one remainder eight.
2701000	2704000	Also four divides into eight two times,
2704000	2709000	so we have one plus eight plus two, and that's 11.
2712000	2716000	For the month number, the number for September is five.
2717000	2722000	And for the day number, the 28, it's 28.
2722000	2724000	And if you add all these numbers together,
2724000	2729000	you get six plus 11 plus five plus 28, which is 50.
2729000	2733000	And 50 is one more than a multiple of seven.
2733000	2739000	So the answer is one, which is Monday, which is correct.
2743000	2746000	How about the question I posed earlier?
2747000	2752000	In which years of the century does February have five Sundays?
2752000	2756000	For this to happen, February must have 29 days,
2756000	2758000	so it must be a leap year.
2758000	2762000	Now the first of January 2001 was a Monday,
2762000	2765000	or you can start with any other date whose day you know.
2765000	2770000	So you can easily check that the first of February was a Thursday.
2770000	2774000	Now the number of days in any non-leap year is 365,
2774000	2777000	which is one more than a multiple of seven.
2777000	2780000	So the first of February 2001 was a Thursday,
2780000	2783000	first of February 2002 is a Friday,
2783000	2786000	first of February 2003 is a Saturday,
2786000	2789000	and first of February 2004 is a Sunday.
2789000	2792000	So that's one answer, 2004.
2792000	2795000	Also the cycle of days repeats every 28 years,
2795000	2798000	because the total number of days in 28 years
2798000	2804000	is 28 times 365 plus seven leap days,
2804000	2807000	and this is exactly divisible by seven.
2807000	2819000	So adding 28 years to 2004 gives 2032, 2060, 2088.
2821000	2824000	So the only years in the century where February has five Sundays
2824000	2829000	is 2004, 2032, 2060 and 2088.
2835000	2838000	For my final topic, I want to look at another result of Fermat
2838000	2841000	and the generalisation of it by Euler.
2841000	2843000	If parts of this get too technical,
2843000	2845000	don't worry about the details,
2845000	2847000	but try to follow the general story.
2850000	2853000	One form of Fermat's little theorem, as it's often called,
2854000	2857000	tells us that if you choose any whole number A
2857000	2860000	and any prime number P
2860000	2865000	and calculate A to the power P minus A,
2865000	2869000	then the result is always exactly divisible by P.
2871000	2874000	For example, if we choose A to be eight
2874000	2877000	and the prime P to be 37,
2877000	2880000	then we find without calculating it
2880000	2885000	that eight to the 37 minus eight is exactly divisible by 37.
2888000	2891000	And we can also get another version of Fermat's result,
2891000	2894000	which we'll need in a moment, by dividing by A,
2894000	2897000	and we can do this if P doesn't divide A.
2897000	2900000	And it tells us that eight to the P minus one,
2900000	2904000	minus one, is also exactly divisible by P.
2905000	2911000	For example, when A is two and P is 53,
2911000	2915000	we see that two to the power 52 minus one
2915000	2918000	is exactly divisible by 53,
2918000	2922000	which we can also write using our clock arithmetic
2922000	2927000	as two to the 52 is one mod 53.
2927000	2930000	And I'm going to use that result in a minute.
2931000	2935000	But before that, how do we prove Fermat's little theorem?
2936000	2939000	We can do so using algebra,
2939000	2942000	but here's a different method that I rather like
2942000	2946000	by counting necklaces, coloured necklaces.
2946000	2950000	Our necklaces will have P beads
2950000	2953000	and there are A colours available,
2953000	2957000	and in our colourings we're going to use at least two colours.
2958000	2961000	First of all, notice, as you can see on the left,
2961000	2963000	that necklaces can be rotated.
2963000	2965000	So the necklace on the left,
2965000	2969000	which is red, blue, red, red, yellow,
2969000	2972000	is the same as if we start with blue,
2972000	2975000	blue, red, red, yellow, red,
2975000	2979000	and also the same as the other ones shown on the left.
2981000	2984000	Now how many strings of coloured beads can there be?
2985000	2990000	Well, the total number is you've got A colours for the first bead,
2990000	2993000	A for the second bead, A for the third and so on.
2993000	2997000	So that gives us a total of A to the power P for P beads.
2999000	3002000	But we must exclude all the strings in just one colour,
3002000	3004000	such as red, red, red, red, red,
3004000	3007000	and there are A of these, one for each colour.
3007000	3013000	So this seems to give us A to the P minus A strings of beads.
3014000	3017000	But we're taking these and making them into necklaces,
3017000	3020000	and for necklaces each one is counted P times over.
3020000	3023000	So we have to divide that number by P.
3023000	3026000	So the number of different coloured necklaces
3026000	3029000	is A to the P minus A divided by P.
3032000	3035000	But the number must be, it must be a whole number.
3035000	3039000	So A to the P minus A must be exactly divisible by P,
3039000	3041000	as we wanted to prove.
3044000	3048000	And we can use this result to tell us about the shuffling of cards.
3050000	3053000	Starting with a normal pack of cards we can do a riffle shuffle,
3053000	3056000	that is we divide into two piles as shown in the middle,
3056000	3060000	and then shuffle it so the cards in the two piles alternate
3060000	3062000	as shown on the right.
3063000	3066000	Now if you carry on shuffling the pack in the same way,
3066000	3068000	how many shuffles do you need
3068000	3072000	before every card returns to its original position?
3073000	3076000	We can answer this with Fermat's little theorem.
3079000	3082000	Where does each card move after the first shuffle?
3082000	3085000	You can check that the card originally in position X
3085000	3088000	moves to position 2X,
3088000	3093000	or to position 2X mod 53 when 2X is larger than 52.
3095000	3098000	For example, the card that starts in position 1
3100000	3102000	ends up in position 2.
3104000	3107000	And the card that starts in position 27
3108000	3110000	moves to position 54,
3110000	3114000	which mod 53 is position 1.
3115000	3119000	So the new ordering of the cards, as shown on the right,
3119000	3124000	is 271, 282, 293 and so on,
3124000	3129000	to 51, 25, 52, 26.
3130000	3132000	So after one shuffle,
3132000	3134000	the card in position X
3134000	3138000	has moved to position 2X mod 53.
3139000	3146000	And after two shuffles, it then moves to position 4X mod 53 and so on.
3146000	3153000	So after n shuffles, it moves to position 2 to the nX mod 53.
3154000	3157000	And if the pack has now returned to its original order,
3157000	3160000	this must be the same as position X.
3161000	3164000	And that's true for each card.
3164000	3171000	So 2 to the n times X is the same as X mod 53 for each card, in each case.
3171000	3177000	If we now divide by X, this tells us that 2 to the n is 1 mod 53.
3177000	3181000	And we want to find the numbers n for which this is true.
3182000	3185000	But as we saw before, with Fermat's little theorem,
3185000	3188000	2 to the 52 is 1 mod 53.
3188000	3193000	So the pack is returned to its original order after 52 shuffles.
3196000	3199000	But is that the smallest possible number of shuffles?
3199000	3201000	Well, if it happened after fewer shuffles,
3201000	3206000	then the number of shuffles would have to divide 52, it turns out.
3206000	3210000	And you can check, as I've done below, that none of them works.
3210000	3213000	So the answer to this question is 52.
3215000	3218000	But the question I posed at the beginning of the lecture
3218000	3222000	was involved shuffling a pack with two jokers.
3223000	3226000	So we now have 54 cards.
3226000	3234000	And doing what we did earlier tells us that 2 to the n is now 1 mod 55 instead of mod 53.
3235000	3238000	But this time we can't use Fermat's little theorem
3238000	3241000	to deduce that the smallest number of shuffles is 54
3241000	3244000	because 55 isn't a prime number.
3246000	3249000	So how do we get round this difficulty?
3250000	3254000	Well, if 55 divides exactly into 2 to the n minus 1,
3254000	3258000	then so do 5 and 11, and these are both primes.
3258000	3261000	So we can apply Fermat's little theorem to each one,
3261000	3265000	telling us that 2 to the 4 is 1 mod 5.
3266000	3271000	And 2 to the 10 is 1 mod 11.
3271000	3273000	How do we combine these?
3273000	3277000	Raising the first one to the fifth power tells us that 2 to the 20 is 1 mod 5,
3277000	3282000	and squaring the second one tells us 2 to the 20 is also 1 mod 11.
3282000	3284000	And combining these, which we're allowed to do,
3284000	3288000	tells us that 2 to the 20 is 1 mod 55.
3288000	3293000	So the pack is restored to its original order after 20 shuffles.
3293000	3300000	And we can check as before that no smaller number of shuffles works.
3300000	3306000	So the answer to our original problem is 20 shuffles.
3306000	3309000	Raymond, can you possibly add a piece of paper?
3309000	3315000	We've just used Fermat's result that the prime p does not divide the number a,
3315000	3319000	then h to the p minus 1 can be divided exactly by p.
3319000	3324000	That is, h to the p minus 1 is 1 mod p.
3324000	3328000	But what can we say if we replace p by a number that isn't prime?
3329000	3332000	Unlikely, as it may seem, and we'll see in a minute,
3332000	3335000	our answer, which is due to Euler, arises in cryptography,
3335000	3339000	which will be our final example and is fundamental in such security issues
3339000	3342000	as how our credit cards be kept safe.
3342000	3344000	So number theory can be used to solve problems
3344000	3349000	that are even more important than the shuffling of cards.
3349000	3353000	Now, just as Fermat's result tells us that the number a raised to the power p minus 1
3353000	3356000	is 1 mod multiple p.
3356000	3361000	So Euler's more general formula tells us that for two numbers a and n,
3361000	3366000	a raised to some power is 1 more than the multiple of n.
3366000	3368000	But what is this power?
3368000	3372000	It's called Euler's totion function, or phi function,
3372000	3378000	denoted at Gauss's suggestion by the Greek letter phi.
3378000	3380000	Given any whole number n,
3380000	3385000	phi of n counts the numbers up to n that have no factors in common with n.
3385000	3389000	For example, if n is 10, the number with factors in common with 10
3389000	3394000	are the even numbers 2, 4, 6 and 8, and the numbers 5 and 10 itself.
3394000	3397000	So the only numbers with no factors in common with 10
3397000	3400000	are 1, 3, 7 and 9, and there are four of them.
3400000	3403000	So phi of 10 is 4.
3403000	3407000	Likewise, if n is 12, then the numbers who count are 1,
3407000	3414000	not 2, 3 or 4, 5, not 6, 7, not 8, 9 or 10, 11, not 12,
3414000	3417000	so phi of 12 is also 4.
3417000	3420000	And we can easily check that for any prime number p,
3420000	3424000	phi of p is p minus 1 because we don't count p itself.
3424000	3427000	And this tells us that if p is prime,
3427000	3432000	then Euler's theorem reduces to Fermat's theorem, which we had above.
3432000	3435000	And we can also prove that if p and q are both primes,
3435000	3440000	then phi of their product, pq, is p minus 1 times q minus 1.
3440000	3443000	For example, and we'll need this in a minute,
3443000	3448000	1,073 is the product of the primes 29 and 37.
3448000	3453000	So phi of 1,073 is 29 minus 1 times 37 minus 1,
3453000	3459000	28 times 36 or 1,08.
3459000	3465000	So now at last, in the last five minutes, to our credit cards.
3465000	3468000	RSA cryptography is named after the initials of Revesh,
3468000	3471000	Shamir, a Edelman, who found it in 1978,
3471000	3474000	not knowing that it had earlier been invented at Bletchley Park
3474000	3477000	by Cliff Cox, but kept secret.
3477000	3479000	Now this may look daunting,
3479000	3482000	but don't worry too much about the details just yet.
3482000	3486000	The main points are that the whole process of securing your credit cards
3486000	3489000	appears on this one page,
3489000	3493000	and that at one stage it uses Euler's theorem.
3493000	3496000	It also relies on the fact that we can easily multiply
3496000	3499000	two prime numbers together,
3499000	3502000	but we can't usually go the other way around.
3502000	3506000	Even we can multiply 7 and 13 to give 91,
3506000	3511000	but turning it around, factorising 91 and 7 plus times 13,
3511000	3513000	wasn't immediately obvious.
3513000	3515000	And for large primes,
3515000	3518000	multiplying is effectively a one-way process,
3518000	3520000	like squeezing toothpaste from a tube
3520000	3523000	or breaking eggs to make an omelet.
3523000	3528000	So let me now just explain why your credit cards are safe.
3528000	3532000	Suppose that Alice wishes to send a secret message to Bob
3532000	3536000	in such a way that it cannot be intercepted by an eavesdropper,
3536000	3539000	sometimes called Eve.
3539000	3543000	Bob first selects two prime, large primes,
3543000	3545000	with maybe 200 digits each,
3545000	3549000	and multiplies them to give the number N is PQ.
3549000	3551000	In our simplified example,
3551000	3554000	P and Q were 29 and 37,
3554000	3559000	and N is their product 1,073.
3559000	3562000	Bob then calculates 5N, as we did earlier,
3562000	3564000	and we got 1,088.
3564000	3569000	And he then chooses a number E with no factors in common with it.
3569000	3573000	Here he's chosen E to be 11.
3573000	3576000	He then publicly announces the two numbers,
3576000	3578000	capital N and E,
3578000	3582000	but not P and Q, its factors, which only he knows.
3582000	3586000	So N and E are the public key,
3586000	3590000	which is known to anyone who wants to find it out.
3590000	3595000	Now, to encode her message, Alice first converts it to numerical form,
3595000	3598000	for example, by taking A as 1, B as 2, and so on,
3598000	3601000	and calls it capital M.
3601000	3604000	So M is the message.
3604000	3606000	When E and capital N,
3606000	3610000	she then calculates M to the power E,
3610000	3614000	and takes the result mod N and causes capital E.
3614000	3619000	This is her coded message, which she sends to Bob.
3619000	3621000	So she knows E and N,
3621000	3623000	and she knows her own message M,
3623000	3625000	she calculates N to the E mod N,
3625000	3630000	and that's the message that she sends to Bob.
3630000	3633000	Bob now has to decode it,
3633000	3636000	because E and phi of N have no factors in common,
3636000	3639000	it can be shown that there are numbers...
3639000	3641000	Whoops.
3646000	3649000	Because E and phi of N have no factors in common,
3649000	3652000	it can be shown that there are numbers little M and little N,
3652000	3654000	satisfying this equation here,
3654000	3657000	so that M times E is 1 mod phi N,
3657000	3660000	and from this, he can calculate M.
3660000	3664000	So, basically, there's a method of calculating this number, little M.
3664000	3669000	In our example, 11M was 1 mod 1008,
3669000	3673000	and Bob can then calculate M to be 275.
3673000	3676000	And this is where Euler's theorem comes in.
3676000	3680000	M to the power phi N is 1 mod phi N.
3680000	3682000	And it follows from this by a line of algebra,
3682000	3684000	which I won't go into,
3684000	3690000	that calculating E to the M mod N gives Alice's message M.
3690000	3697000	Alice's message is E to the, in this case, 2 to the 75 mod 1073.
3697000	3699000	Don't worry about the details.
3699000	3704000	The important thing is that the whole process simply relies on two calculations.
3704000	3707000	Alice calculates N to the E mod N,
3707000	3710000	Bob calculates E to the M mod N,
3710000	3716000	and that is the whole of the reason that your credit card is secure.
3716000	3720000	And I hope you'll remember that next time you use your credit card.
3720000	3724000	And if not, then the obvious place to look it up,
3724000	3727000	and all the other topics and problems I've been talking about,
3727000	3731000	and much else besides, is in the book I've been launching today.
3731000	3734000	May I encourage you to give it to all your friends for Christmas
3734000	3738000	in order to solve your Christmas present problems for this year?
3738000	3741000	Moreover, you'll probably lose all your friends as a result,
3741000	3744000	so this will solve your Christmas present problems next year too.
3744000	3746000	Thank you for listening.
