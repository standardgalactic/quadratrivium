00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Welcome to Gresham College, and to this book launch of my number theory, a very short introduction.

00:07.000 --> 00:16.000
It's one of the latest in the popular series of very short introductions, which Oxford University Press has produced over the past 25 years.

00:16.000 --> 00:27.000
I was also fortunate to have been invited to write the very short introduction to combinatorics, which appeared in 2016.

00:28.000 --> 00:38.000
I've always been interested in the history of mathematics, and in the book and in this lecture you'll meet four of the prime figures who feature throughout my story.

00:38.000 --> 00:50.000
The Greek mathematician Euclid of Alexandria top right, who wrote his classic text The Elements in the third century BC, and who probably didn't look like this.

00:50.000 --> 00:58.000
Pierre Fermat, on the left, a lawyer in southern France in the early 17th century.

00:58.000 --> 01:06.000
Leonard Euler, an 18th century Swiss mathematician who was probably the most prolific mathematician of all time,

01:06.000 --> 01:15.000
and Carl Friedrich Gauss, a German mathematician who published a classic text on number theory in the year 1801.

01:16.000 --> 01:24.000
It was Gauss who claimed that mathematics is the queen of the sciences, and number theory is the queen of mathematics.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
So what is number theory?

01:28.000 --> 01:36.000
Basically, it's the branch of mathematics that's primarily concerned with our ordinary counting numbers 1, 2, 3, etc.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
Sometimes called the positive integers.

01:39.000 --> 01:45.000
And it's concerned with whether they're odd or even, or are perfect squares or cubes,

01:45.000 --> 01:54.000
or can be divided exactly by seven or some other number, or have some other such property.

01:54.000 --> 02:00.000
Particularly important throughout the subject of the prime numbers, which we can think of as the building blocks of the subject,

02:00.000 --> 02:08.000
like atoms in chemistry, and which are the only numbers whose only factors are itself and one.

02:08.000 --> 02:16.000
For example, 11, 13, 17 and 19 are all prime, we can't split them up into factors.

02:16.000 --> 02:24.000
But 15 and 18 are not, because 15 is three times five, and 18 is two times nine,

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
which we can then write as two times three times three.

02:28.000 --> 02:37.000
But we must be careful, because some numbers that look as though they might be prime numbers, such as 91 and 323 are not,

02:37.000 --> 02:43.000
because 91 is seven times 13, and 323 is 17 times 19.

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
So it's not always easy to spot whether a given number is prime.

02:47.000 --> 02:52.000
For example, how about the three numbers at the bottom of the screen?

02:52.000 --> 02:58.000
I'll tell you about these ones later on.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
So here are some of the questions that I'll be talking about today.

03:02.000 --> 03:09.000
The first ones are clearly about numbers, such as whether that last number is prime,

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
whether any number made entirely of ones is a perfect square,

03:13.000 --> 03:18.000
and various problems arising from the calendar.

03:18.000 --> 03:25.000
But number theory also expands into other areas, such as the geometry of right-angled triangles,

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
and the construction of regular shapes.

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
You'll also see applications to the shuffling of cards,

03:33.000 --> 03:38.000
and even to more practical matters, such as the security of your credit cards,

03:38.000 --> 03:44.000
which is based on a result on prime numbers that dates back to the 18th century.

03:44.000 --> 03:50.000
Number theory, once an abstract branch of pure mathematics that was studied for its own sake,

03:50.000 --> 03:57.000
is now also central to the study of cryptography and to other subjects of practical importance.

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
So here are the subjects I'll be talking about today.

04:02.000 --> 04:07.000
First, prime numbers. How many are there? How are they distributed?

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
And how do they arise in geometry?

04:10.000 --> 04:15.000
Next, perfect squares. How can we recognise them?

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
What do they tell us about right-angled triangles?

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
And I'll also show you two results related to Fermar.

04:23.000 --> 04:28.000
Third is clock arithmetic and the mathematics of the calendar.

04:28.000 --> 04:34.000
And finally, yet another result of Fermar is generalisation by Euler,

04:34.000 --> 04:39.000
and applications to the counting of necklaces, the shuffling of cards,

04:39.000 --> 04:44.000
and, as promised, protecting your credit cards.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
And if you find any of these topics too technical,

04:47.000 --> 04:52.000
just hold on as I'll soon switch back to more straightforward topics.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
So let's start with prime numbers.

04:58.000 --> 05:02.000
Here's a table of the primes up to 100.

05:02.000 --> 05:07.000
It's been produced by an ancient Greek method called the sieve of eratosnes,

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
where we first list all the numbers up to 100,

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
then cross out the multiples of 2, that is 4, 6, 8, etc.

05:16.000 --> 05:22.000
Then the multiples of 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, etc.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
Actually, 6 and 12 have already been crossed out.

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
Then those are 5, and then 7,

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
until we get the numbers that appear in yellow here.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
These are the primes.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
You may ask why one isn't a prime.

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
The answer relies on a fundamental property of our number system,

05:43.000 --> 05:48.000
that we can get every number by multiplying primes together.

05:48.000 --> 05:53.000
For example, 60 is 2 times 2 times 3 times 5,

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
and that this can be done in only one way,

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
apart from the order that the primes appear.

05:59.000 --> 06:04.000
So we could have written 60 as 2 times 5 times 3 times 2,

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
or some other order,

06:06.000 --> 06:11.000
but there must always be 2 2s, 1 3 and 1 5.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
But if we took 1 to be a prime,

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
we could then write 6 as 2 times 3,

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
or 2 times 3 times 1,

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
or 2 times 3 times 1 times 1, and so on.

06:23.000 --> 06:28.000
We'd lose this fundamental property of factorisation into primes in only one way.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
That would be a great loss,

06:30.000 --> 06:35.000
so we choose to make 1 not a prime.

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
But we can never list all the primes because the list goes on forever.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
But how would we prove this?

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Unfortunately, given any prime,

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
there's no rule for listing the next one.

06:48.000 --> 06:53.000
For example, what's the next prime after 997?

06:53.000 --> 06:57.000
It's not at all obvious that it's 109.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
But Euclid, in his book The Elements,

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
came up with a very different approach.

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
Here it is in the earliest surviving copy of The Elements

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
from AD 888 in the Bodleian Library in Oxford.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
And here's an English version of Euclid's proof.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
The thing to note is that it's a geometric argument.

07:19.000 --> 07:24.000
Instead of numbers, he used the lengths of various lines.

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
So how did his proof go?

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
Here it is in modern language.

07:31.000 --> 07:35.000
Let's make the assumption that the list does not go on forever,

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
and that these are the only primes.

07:37.000 --> 07:42.000
We've called them P1, P2, P3 and so on up to Pn.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
We're assuming there are no others.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
We'll now create a new number by multiplying them all together

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
and adding one.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
And we'll call this capital N.

07:54.000 --> 07:59.000
Then each of our primes divides the quantity in brackets,

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
the product, and so none of them can divide the number N,

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
which is got by adding one to it.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
So what can we say about N?

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
Because it's not divisible by any of our primes,

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
it must itself be a new prime,

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
or possibly be made up of new primes.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
So in either case, there's a new prime,

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
and this contradicts our assumption that we've listed all of the primes.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
So our assumption must have been wrong.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
We cannot list all the primes,

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
and so the list must go on forever.

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
Incidentally, both of these possibilities for N can occur.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
If the only primes that we knew were 2, 3, 5 and 7,

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
then N would be their product, that's 210 plus 1,

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
which is 211,

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
and this is a prime that we didn't have before.

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
But if the only primes that we knew were the ones up to 13,

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
then multiplying them together and adding one

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
to N is 30,031,

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
which actually isn't prime, it's 59 times 509,

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
so here we get two new primes we didn't have before.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
But we can say more.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
We can adapt Euclid's proof to prove that the list of primes

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
of the four N plus three goes on forever.

09:21.000 --> 09:25.000
These are the primes which have three more than a multiple of four,

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
such as three itself,

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
or seven, which is four plus three,

09:31.000 --> 09:35.000
or eleven, which is two fours plus three, and so on.

09:35.000 --> 09:39.000
So these are all primes of the four and four N plus three.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
We can also prove that there are infinitely many primes

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
that are one more than a multiple of four.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
The primes of the four and four N plus one, such as five,

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
that's four plus one,

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
thirteen, three fours plus one,

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
and seventeen, four fours plus one, and so on.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
So there are infinitely many primes of the four and four N plus one,

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
and four N plus three.

10:05.000 --> 10:09.000
But we obviously can't say the same for numbers of the four and four N plus two,

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
because these numbers are all even,

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
and so none of them can be prime apart from two itself.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
And the general result along these lines

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
was proved by the German mathematician Lejeune Dirichlet

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
in 1837.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
In this tour de force,

10:28.000 --> 10:32.000
he showed that there are infinitely many primes of the four N plus B

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
for any numbers A and B,

10:35.000 --> 10:39.000
as long as A and B have no factors in common.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
This result was, and still is,

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
extremely difficult to prove.

10:45.000 --> 10:49.000
But it includes the cases four N plus one and four N plus three,

10:49.000 --> 10:53.000
because four has no factors in common with one or three.

10:56.000 --> 11:00.000
And if we now take A to be ten and B to be nine,

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
which also have no factors in common,

11:02.000 --> 11:08.000
we see there are infinitely many primes of the four and ten N plus nine.

11:08.000 --> 11:12.000
That is infinitely many prime numbers ending with nine.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
And in the same way,

11:15.000 --> 11:19.000
there are infinitely many prime numbers ending with one,

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
or with three,

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
or with seven.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Let's now turn to something different.

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
Numbers that are one less than a power of two.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
They're named after Mariam Meir Sen,

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
a French mathematician and friar

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
who investigated them in the 17th century.

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
If we look at these Meir Sen numbers,

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
we'll see that some of them are prime.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
Two squared minus one is three.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
Two cubed minus one is seven.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
Two to the fifth minus one is 31.

11:58.000 --> 12:02.000
And two to the seventh minus one is 127.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
And these are all primes.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
But other Meir Sen numbers are not prime.

12:08.000 --> 12:12.000
Two to the fourth minus one is 15, which isn't prime.

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
And two to the sixth minus one is 63.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
Two to the eighth minus one is 255.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
And two to the ninth minus one is 511.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
And none of these is prime.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
So looking at the powers of two that appear here,

12:28.000 --> 12:34.000
it's very tempting to believe that two to the N minus one is always prime

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
when the exponent, the power N, is prime.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
Here they're two, three, five and seven.

12:39.000 --> 12:44.000
And that it's never prime when the exponent N isn't prime.

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
And here they're four, six, eight and nine.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
But is this always the case?

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
The answer is partly.

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
It's not difficult to show that if N is not prime,

12:58.000 --> 13:02.000
then two to the N minus one isn't prime either.

13:02.000 --> 13:07.000
But if N is prime, we have to be more careful.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
For example, if we take the next prime, 11,

13:10.000 --> 13:16.000
we have two to the 11 minus one, which is 2047.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
Now this may look prime, but it isn't.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
It's 23 times 89.

13:21.000 --> 13:27.000
So if N is prime, then two to the N minus one may or may not be prime.

13:27.000 --> 13:33.000
Mersen himself came up with a list of primes of this form,

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
which is why they're named after him.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
He made a few false claims and he left out a couple of them,

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
but it was an impressive list for the time,

13:42.000 --> 13:47.000
especially because he correctly included two to the 127 minus one,

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
which is a prime number with 39 digits.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
So why are these numbers of interest,

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
or are they simply a curiosity?

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
It turns out that if we're looking for new primes,

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
then Mersen primes turn out to be our best bet.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
For example, the last 17 primes that have been found

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
have all been of this kind,

14:11.000 --> 14:16.000
including the most recently discovered one in December 2018,

14:16.000 --> 14:24.000
which is two to the 82,589,933 minus one,

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
a prime number with almost 25 million digits.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
But another reason for looking at Mersen primes

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
is that they turn up in connection with a problem

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
that dates from ancient Greek times.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
The Greeks were interested in numbers,

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
which they called perfect numbers,

14:45.000 --> 14:50.000
whose factors, apart from the number itself, add up to the original number.

14:51.000 --> 14:56.000
For example, six is perfect because it's factors of one, two and three,

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
and these add up to six.

14:59.000 --> 15:05.000
And 28 is perfect because it's factors of one, two, four, seven and fourteen,

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
and these add up to 28.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
The next two, also known to the Greeks,

15:13.000 --> 15:17.000
were 496 and 8128,

15:17.000 --> 15:25.000
and then there aren't any more of them until 33,550,366.

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
So how did the Greeks find these perfect numbers?

15:32.000 --> 15:36.000
To see why they found them, let's factorise them.

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
We find that six is two times three,

15:39.000 --> 15:44.000
which we can write as two to the one times two squared minus one.

15:45.000 --> 15:49.000
28 is four times seven, which we can write as two squared,

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
times two cubed minus one.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
496 is 16 times 31,

15:56.000 --> 16:01.000
which is two to the fourth times two to the fifth minus one.

16:02.000 --> 16:07.000
8128 is 64 times 127,

16:07.000 --> 16:11.000
which is two to the sixth times two to the seventh minus one.

16:12.000 --> 16:18.000
And the other one, 33,550,336,

16:18.000 --> 16:22.000
is 4,096 times 8,191,

16:22.000 --> 16:26.000
which is two to the twelfth times two to the thirteenth minus one.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
So in each case, it's a power of two,

16:28.000 --> 16:32.000
multiplied by a mercen prime, in fact, the next one.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
Well, all of this is known to Euclid,

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
whose book, The Elements, includes a proof

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
that the product of two to the n minus one

16:41.000 --> 16:46.000
and two to the n minus one is a perfect number,

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
as long as the second of these numbers is prime.

16:50.000 --> 16:54.000
The next question is, does this give us all the perfect numbers?

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
2,000 years after Euclid,

16:57.000 --> 17:02.000
then did Euler prove that every even perfect number is of Euclid's type?

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
But are there any odd perfect numbers?

17:07.000 --> 17:11.000
Euler didn't know, and nor indeed does anyone.

17:12.000 --> 17:16.000
If there are any odd perfect numbers,

17:16.000 --> 17:21.000
there'll be absolutely huge, more than 10 to the power of 1,500,

17:21.000 --> 17:25.000
so they probably don't exist, but who knows?

17:28.000 --> 17:33.000
Before we leave prime numbers, let's explore one more type.

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
This time introduced by Fermat.

17:38.000 --> 17:42.000
Instead of looking at prime numbers of the form 2 to the n minus one,

17:42.000 --> 17:46.000
let's consider primes of the form 2 to the n plus one.

17:47.000 --> 17:54.000
It turns out that these can be prime only when n is itself a power of two,

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
two to the two to the n plus one.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
So let's look at some of these.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
Fermat found the first few.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
Two to the one plus one, which is three.

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
Two to the two plus one, which is five.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
Two to the four plus one, which is 17.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
Notice that the exponents are powers of two.

18:19.000 --> 18:23.000
Two to the eighth plus one is 257,

18:23.000 --> 18:29.000
and two to the sixteenth plus one, which is 65,537.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
Fermat noticed that these are all prime,

18:33.000 --> 18:38.000
and he made the conjecture that every number of this form must be prime.

18:40.000 --> 18:44.000
So the next one to test is two to the 32 plus one.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
Is that prime?

18:47.000 --> 18:51.000
Well, unfortunately, it's a ten digit number over four billion,

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
and Fermat's pocket calculator didn't go that far.

18:55.000 --> 18:59.000
So Fermat never found out whether his conjecture was true or not.

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
But once again, Leonard Euler came to the rescue.

19:06.000 --> 19:10.000
After doing many calculations, he discovered that two to the 32 plus one

19:10.000 --> 19:15.000
can be evenly divided by 641.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
And later he found a method that gave this answer more quickly.

19:20.000 --> 19:25.000
But even Euler was stuck with the next one, two to the 64th plus one,

19:25.000 --> 19:30.000
which was a 20 digit number, which also turns out not to be prime.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
But its smallest prime factor is over 200,000,

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
so it's not surprising that Euler missed it.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
But worse was to come.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
Many other Fermat numbers are now known,

19:43.000 --> 19:46.000
and none of them has turned out to be prime.

19:46.000 --> 19:50.000
So Fermat's conjecture has turned out to be rather an unfortunate one.

19:54.000 --> 19:58.000
But all is not lost as Fermat primes turned up again,

19:58.000 --> 20:03.000
but in the most unexpected place, the drawing of regular polygons.

20:03.000 --> 20:07.000
These are polygons where all the size and all the angles are equal.

20:09.000 --> 20:13.000
The ancient Greeks were very interested in trying to construct these,

20:13.000 --> 20:18.000
whereby constructing, they allow themselves to use only an unmarked ruler,

20:18.000 --> 20:22.000
no measuring allowed, and a pair of compasses.

20:24.000 --> 20:28.000
Here's how Euclid constructed an equilateral triangle.

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
Starting with a line AB,

20:33.000 --> 20:37.000
use the compasses to draw the circle on the left,

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
where the centre is A and the radius is AB.

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
So that gives you the left-hand circle.

20:44.000 --> 20:48.000
Then draw the circle on the right by taking the centre to be B,

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
and the radius is BA.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
And then you have two circles.

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
These two circles intersect at the point C.

21:00.000 --> 21:03.000
Now the length AB is the same as AC

21:03.000 --> 21:06.000
because each is a radius of the left-hand circle,

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
and the length BA is equal to the length BC

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
because each is a radius of the right-hand circle,

21:12.000 --> 21:16.000
so all three sides are equal, and we have an equilateral triangle.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
And constructing a regular hexagon is even easier.

21:25.000 --> 21:30.000
Draw a circle with centre O and some radius OA.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
Then with a compass point A and the same radius,

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
mark off the point B on the circle.

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
Then with a compass point B and the same radius,

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
mark off the point C,

21:43.000 --> 21:47.000
and then in the same way the points D, E and F.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
And if you join these six points together,

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
that gives us a regular hexagon.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
What other polygons can we draw?

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
Euclid also showed how to construct a square

21:58.000 --> 22:03.000
and a regular pentagon using just an unmarked rule and compasses,

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
and he also showed how to double the number of sides

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
of a regular polygon.

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
So starting with an equilateral triangle,

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
with three sides,

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
we can draw a regular hexagon,

22:15.000 --> 22:18.000
and we can draw a regular hexagon.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
The triangle, with three sides,

22:21.000 --> 22:26.000
we can construct regular polygons with six, 12 and 24 sides.

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
And starting with a square, then doubling,

22:30.000 --> 22:35.000
we can construct regular polygons with eight, 16 and 32 sides.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
And starting with a regular pentagon,

22:37.000 --> 22:42.000
we can construct ones with 10, 20 and 40 sides.

22:43.000 --> 22:47.000
And also by combining the constructions for three and five sides,

22:47.000 --> 22:51.000
Euclid constructed a regular polygon with 15 sides.

22:52.000 --> 22:55.000
But neither Euclid nor anyone else

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
was able to construct regular polygons

22:58.000 --> 23:03.000
with seven, nine, 11, 13, 14, 18 or 19 sides.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
Are any of these possible?

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
Enter Gauss.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
When ageed only 18,

23:13.000 --> 23:18.000
he first showed how to construct a regular polygon with 17 sides.

23:20.000 --> 23:23.000
He then answered the construction question completely

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
by proving a remarkable result.

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
That a regular polygon with n sides

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
can be constructed by ruler and compasses

23:33.000 --> 23:39.000
if and only if n is obtained by taking some power of two

23:39.000 --> 23:43.000
multiplied by unequal Fermat primes,

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
which is I remind you of the five listed here.

23:48.000 --> 23:52.000
So for example, we can construct polygons with 30 sides

23:53.000 --> 23:57.000
because 30 is two times three times five.

23:58.000 --> 24:02.000
We can do 32 sides because that's the power of two

24:02.000 --> 24:06.000
or 34 sides because that's two times 17

24:07.000 --> 24:11.000
or 40 sides because that's two cubed times five.

24:13.000 --> 24:17.000
But we cannot construct regular polygons with 35 sides

24:17.000 --> 24:22.000
because 35 is five times seven and seven is not allowed.

24:23.000 --> 24:28.000
Or 36 sides because 36 is two squared times three squared

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
and we're not allowed to use three twice.

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
Or 37, which is not a Fermat prime anyway,

24:35.000 --> 24:39.000
or 100 because the factor five occurs twice.

24:40.000 --> 24:44.000
So to answer the question I mentioned at the beginning,

24:44.000 --> 24:48.000
we cannot draw a regular polygon with 100 sides,

24:48.000 --> 24:53.000
but it's remarkable that these Fermat primes occur in such a problem.

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
Let's now leave prime numbers for a while

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
and look at perfect squares.

25:04.000 --> 25:07.000
The first 10 of these are listed here.

25:07.000 --> 25:11.000
One squared is one, two squared is four,

25:11.000 --> 25:15.000
three squared is nine, and so on.

25:16.000 --> 25:22.000
And you notice that none of these squares ends with two, three, seven or eight.

25:23.000 --> 25:28.000
And this is true in general because if we square in a larger number like 27,

25:28.000 --> 25:32.000
it must end with the same digit as if we'd squared seven.

25:33.000 --> 25:38.000
So no perfect square can end in two, three, seven or eight.

25:40.000 --> 25:43.000
One interesting result about perfect squares

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
is if we add up the first few positive odd numbers,

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
then we always get a square.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
One is one squared.

25:51.000 --> 25:55.000
One plus three is four, which is two squared.

25:55.000 --> 26:00.000
One plus three plus five is nine, which is three squared, and so on.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
We can prove this quite easily by arithmetic,

26:04.000 --> 26:08.000
but more informative is this geometric picture,

26:08.000 --> 26:12.000
which was supposedly known to the Pythagoreans of Ancient Greece,

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
that shows why it's true.

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
Here each L shape has an odd number of dots,

26:17.000 --> 26:21.000
one dot, three dot, five dots, seven dots, and so on.

26:21.000 --> 26:25.000
And they all fit together to make a perfect square.

26:26.000 --> 26:33.000
We also notice that every square is either a multiple of four, such as 16,

26:33.000 --> 26:38.000
or is one more than the multiple of four, such as 25.

26:39.000 --> 26:44.000
No perfect square has a form four n plus two or four n plus three.

26:46.000 --> 26:51.000
And this is because if n is even, say it's twice k,

26:52.000 --> 26:56.000
then n squared is four times something.

26:56.000 --> 27:00.000
And if n is odd, equal to two k plus one, say,

27:00.000 --> 27:05.000
then n squared is four times something plus one.

27:06.000 --> 27:10.000
So numbers made up entirely of ones, such as 11,

27:10.000 --> 27:16.000
111, 111, and so on, cannot be perfect squares,

27:16.000 --> 27:20.000
because they are all three more than a multiple of four,

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
and that's not allowed.

27:25.000 --> 27:28.000
Another nice result is if n is odd,

27:28.000 --> 27:32.000
then its square must be one more than a multiple of eight.

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
And we can see this from our earlier result.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
If n is two k plus one,

27:37.000 --> 27:42.000
then n squared is four times k times k plus one plus one.

27:43.000 --> 27:48.000
But k times k plus one is the product of two consecutive numbers.

27:49.000 --> 27:52.000
And if you had two consecutive numbers, one must be odd,

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
and the other must be even.

27:54.000 --> 28:00.000
So that product is even, giving us eight times something plus one.

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
But a much more attractive way of illustrating this result

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
is to draw a picture like the one here.

28:08.000 --> 28:11.000
Where there are eight triangles of dots,

28:11.000 --> 28:14.000
plus an extra one in the middle.

28:14.000 --> 28:17.000
So in this case, we have nine squared dots,

28:17.000 --> 28:21.000
are made of eight lots of ten dots, plus one,

28:21.000 --> 28:24.000
and so has the form eight n plus one.

28:24.000 --> 28:27.000
And this works whatever number n is.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
Perfect squares also feature prominently

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
in the geometry of right-angled triangles.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
From our school days,

28:36.000 --> 28:39.000
we remember the Pythagorean theorem,

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
which was probably not due to Pythagoras himself,

28:42.000 --> 28:45.000
and was originally a result about areas.

28:46.000 --> 28:49.000
But it tells us that if A, B, and C are equal,

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
then they are equal,

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
and they are equal,

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
but it tells us that if A, B, and C are the lengths

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
of the sides of a right-angled triangle,

28:59.000 --> 29:03.000
with C the longest side, or hypotenuse,

29:03.000 --> 29:07.000
then A squared plus B squared equals C squared.

29:09.000 --> 29:12.000
And today I'm interested in when these side lengths

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
are all whole numbers,

29:15.000 --> 29:18.000
such as the 3, 4, 5 triangle,

29:18.000 --> 29:22.000
where 3 squared plus 4 squared is 5 squared.

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
That's 9 plus 16 is 25.

29:27.000 --> 29:30.000
The 5, 12, 13 right-angled triangle

29:30.000 --> 29:34.000
with 5 squared plus 12 squared is 13 squared.

29:34.000 --> 29:38.000
25 plus 144 is 169.

29:40.000 --> 29:43.000
And the 15, 8, 17 triangle

29:43.000 --> 29:47.000
with 15 squared plus 8 squared is 17 squared.

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
Well, 225 plus 64 is 289.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
What are the examples are there,

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
and can we find them all?

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
Well, we can easily get more examples

29:59.000 --> 30:02.000
by scaling out the size of these triangles.

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
For example, from the 3, 4, 5 triangle,

30:05.000 --> 30:10.000
we can scale up by 10 to get a 30, 40, 50 triangle

30:10.000 --> 30:14.000
with 30 squared plus 40 squared is 50 squared.

30:14.000 --> 30:17.000
Or from 3, 4, 5 we can scale up by 2

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
to get a 6, 8, 10 triangle

30:19.000 --> 30:23.000
with 6 squared plus 8 squared equals 10 squared.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
But these scaling aren't very interesting,

30:26.000 --> 30:29.000
so we'll assume that no scaling have taken place

30:29.000 --> 30:33.000
and that A, B and C have no common factors.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
And in fact, we can assume that any two of them

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
have no common factor because any such factor

30:38.000 --> 30:41.000
will then have to divide the third.

30:42.000 --> 30:46.000
So we can assume that A and B cannot both be even.

30:48.000 --> 30:51.000
We can also assume that they cannot both be odd

30:51.000 --> 30:54.000
because then A squared and B squared

30:54.000 --> 30:57.000
would be one more than a multiple of four.

30:58.000 --> 31:01.000
So that C squared would be two more than a multiple of four

31:01.000 --> 31:04.000
and squares cannot be two more than a multiple of four

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
as we've seen.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
So one of A, B and C is odd

31:08.000 --> 31:12.000
and the other is even, as in our first examples.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
Three and four, one odd, one even,

31:14.000 --> 31:18.000
five and 12, 15 and eight, one odd, one even.

31:22.000 --> 31:26.000
And to be definite, we'll always take A to be odd

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
and B to be even.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
Well, by using similar arguments

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
which I won't go into,

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
we can eventually prove that A, B and C

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
have the forms shown here

31:36.000 --> 31:39.000
for some whole numbers X and Y.

31:39.000 --> 31:43.000
A is X squared minus Y squared,

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
B is two XY

31:45.000 --> 31:48.000
and C is X squared plus Y squared.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
You can check that with these expressions

31:52.000 --> 31:55.000
A squared plus B squared is indeed C squared.

31:55.000 --> 31:59.000
And moreover, we can show that X is greater than Y,

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
that X and Y have no common factors

32:01.000 --> 32:04.000
and that one is even and the other is odd.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
So let's see some examples of this.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
Here's what we had before.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
A has this form, X squared minus Y squared,

32:11.000 --> 32:14.000
B is two XY, C is X squared plus Y squared

32:14.000 --> 32:17.000
where X and Y have these properties.

32:18.000 --> 32:21.000
So let's take some examples for X and Y.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
If X is two and Y is one,

32:23.000 --> 32:27.000
then A is two squared minus one squared which is three.

32:28.000 --> 32:31.000
B is two times two times one which is four

32:31.000 --> 32:34.000
and C is two squared plus one squared which is five.

32:34.000 --> 32:38.000
So we get the right angle triangle with size three, four, five.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
If X is three and Y is two,

32:43.000 --> 32:46.000
then A is three squared minus two squared which is five,

32:46.000 --> 32:49.000
B is two times three times two which is 12

32:49.000 --> 32:52.000
and C is three squared plus two squared which is 13

32:52.000 --> 32:56.000
and we get the triangle with size five, 12, 13.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
And if X is five and Y is two,

33:00.000 --> 33:04.000
then A is five squared minus two squared which is 21,

33:04.000 --> 33:07.000
B is two times five times two which is 20

33:07.000 --> 33:11.000
and C is five squared plus two squared which is 29

33:11.000 --> 33:17.000
and we get the right angle triangle with size 21, 20 and 29.

33:18.000 --> 33:21.000
And using these formulas we can compile a list

33:21.000 --> 33:25.000
that would eventually include all right angle triangles.

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
Now earlier I asked for all right angle triangles

33:31.000 --> 33:35.000
with a side of length 29 and we just found one.

33:36.000 --> 33:40.000
As we've just seen by taking X to be five and Y to be two,

33:40.000 --> 33:44.000
we found the triangle with size 21, 20 and 29.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
But are there any others?

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
Well because 29 is a prime number,

33:51.000 --> 33:54.000
the size can have no common factor

33:54.000 --> 33:58.000
and so we can again use expressions for A, B and C

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
when there's no scaling involved.

34:01.000 --> 34:07.000
But 29 cannot be two X, Y cannot be B because that's even.

34:08.000 --> 34:13.000
And so 29 must either be C which is X squared plus Y squared

34:13.000 --> 34:17.000
or 29 must be A which is X squared minus Y squared.

34:20.000 --> 34:23.000
But if 29 is X squared plus Y squared,

34:23.000 --> 34:26.000
then the only possibility is X is five and Y is two

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
and we had the solution we had before.

34:30.000 --> 34:33.000
And if 29 is X squared minus Y squared,

34:33.000 --> 34:37.000
we can factorize that into two factors as shown here.

34:37.000 --> 34:40.000
And because 29 is prime,

34:40.000 --> 34:43.000
one of those factors must be 29 and the other must be one.

34:44.000 --> 34:48.000
So X plus Y is 29, X minus Y is one

34:48.000 --> 34:53.000
and we can solve those equations to give X is 15 and Y is 14.

34:55.000 --> 34:59.000
It then follows that A is 15 squared minus 14 squared

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
which is 29 as we expected.

35:02.000 --> 35:07.000
B is two times 15 times 14 which is 420

35:08.000 --> 35:12.000
and C is 15 squared plus 14 squared which is 421.

35:14.000 --> 35:17.000
So this is the only other right-angled triangle

35:17.000 --> 35:20.000
with a side of length 29.

35:20.000 --> 35:25.000
Sides of 29, 420 and 421.

35:25.000 --> 35:28.000
Those are the only two right-angled triangles

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
with 29 as one of the sides.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.000
Before we leave perfect squares,

35:36.000 --> 35:39.000
I'd like to show you a couple of results named after Fermat.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
In our study of right-angled triangles,

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
we've been looking at sums of two squares

35:47.000 --> 35:50.000
and we might ask what numbers can be written

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
as the sum of two squares.

35:53.000 --> 35:59.000
For example, 41 is 5 squared plus 4 squared

36:00.000 --> 36:03.000
but 42 cannot be written as the sum of two squares.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.000
How do we look at this?

36:07.000 --> 36:10.000
Well, because all squares have the form 4n or 4 plus 1,

36:10.000 --> 36:15.000
4n plus 1, the sum of two squares must be of the form 4n

36:16.000 --> 36:21.000
or 4n plus 1 which is got by adding a 4n and a 4n plus 1

36:21.000 --> 36:25.000
or 4n plus 2 adding two of those odd numbers.

36:26.000 --> 36:30.000
So we can rule out any numbers of the form 4n plus 3 such as 43.

36:33.000 --> 36:37.000
We notice also that sums of squares in more than one way.

36:38.000 --> 36:44.000
For example, 65 is 64 plus 1 but it's also 49 plus 16.

36:46.000 --> 36:49.000
It turns out that we can deal with the general question

36:49.000 --> 36:52.000
of which numbers can be written as the sum of two squares

36:52.000 --> 36:57.000
if we can first decide which prime numbers are the sum of two squares.

36:59.000 --> 37:02.000
We've just ruled out all the primes of the form 4n plus 3

37:04.000 --> 37:08.000
but as claimed by Fermat and later proved by Euler,

37:08.000 --> 37:13.000
every prime number of the form 4n plus 1 can be written as the sum of two squares.

37:15.000 --> 37:18.000
Moreover, this can happen in only one way.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
So here are some examples.

37:21.000 --> 37:25.000
5 is a prime of the form 4n plus 1.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
5 is 4 plus 1.

37:28.000 --> 37:31.000
13 is 9 plus 4.

37:32.000 --> 37:35.000
17 is 16 plus 1.

37:36.000 --> 37:40.000
29 is 25 plus 4.

37:41.000 --> 37:47.000
41 is 25 plus 16 and you can make up some more for yourself.

37:48.000 --> 37:53.000
But it's a remarkable result proved all those years ago by Euler

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
and conjectured by Fermat.

37:58.000 --> 38:02.000
But the other result of Fermat I want to mention is his famous last theorem

38:02.000 --> 38:05.000
because it was the last of his theorems to be proved.

38:06.000 --> 38:09.000
This is a very famous result in mathematics.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
When we're looking at right-angled triangles,

38:14.000 --> 38:19.000
we found positive numbers a, b and c with a squared plus b squared is c squared.

38:20.000 --> 38:25.000
But what about higher powers such as cubes or fourth powers?

38:25.000 --> 38:31.000
Can we find positive numbers a, b and c with a squared plus b squared equals c

38:31.000 --> 38:34.000
with a cubed plus b cubed equals c cubed

38:35.000 --> 38:38.000
or a to the fourth plus b to the fourth is c to the fourth.

38:39.000 --> 38:45.000
Fermat himself found an ingenious argument to show that there are no solutions for the fourth powers.

38:46.000 --> 38:51.000
In his method of infinite descent, he showed that if there were a solution,

38:51.000 --> 38:55.000
it would give rise to another solution with smaller numbers.

38:56.000 --> 39:01.000
And then that in turn would give rise to yet another solution with yet smaller numbers and so on forever.

39:01.000 --> 39:05.000
But you can't keep on reducing the numbers forever and ever.

39:05.000 --> 39:08.000
So the original equation couldn't have had a solution.

39:11.000 --> 39:18.000
Now Fermat believed that there are no positive number solutions to a to the n plus b to the n is c to the n

39:18.000 --> 39:21.000
for any power n larger than 2.

39:22.000 --> 39:27.000
And he claimed to have a truly marvellous proof but the margin is too small to present it.

39:29.000 --> 39:34.000
I too have a truly marvellous proof but this lecture is too short for me to give it to you.

39:36.000 --> 39:40.000
In any case, Fermat's conjecture was eventually proved in 1995,

39:40.000 --> 39:49.000
350 years after he first mentioned it by Andrew Wiles then at Princeton University and now at Oxford.

39:55.000 --> 39:58.000
Let's now leave squares and look at some clock arithmetic.

39:59.000 --> 40:06.000
If it's nine o'clock and six hours pass, then it's three o'clock.

40:06.000 --> 40:11.000
So we can write nine plus six is three.

40:11.000 --> 40:16.000
And writing mod twelve reminds us that we're using a twelve hour clock.

40:17.000 --> 40:24.000
Similarly, if it's ten o'clock and seven hours pass, then it's five o'clock.

40:24.000 --> 40:29.000
So ten plus seven is five mod twelve.

40:31.000 --> 40:35.000
It actually turns out to be more convenient to write zero rather than twelve.

40:35.000 --> 40:40.000
So eight plus four is twelve o'clock.

40:40.000 --> 40:43.000
In other words, eight plus four is zero mod twelve.

40:45.000 --> 40:49.000
This way of calculating is called modular arithmetic or clock arithmetic

40:49.000 --> 40:54.000
and is introduced by Gauss in his number theory book of 1801.

40:55.000 --> 41:01.000
More generally, we say that A is the same as B mod n

41:01.000 --> 41:05.000
if A and B leave the same remainder when divided by n.

41:07.000 --> 41:13.000
So fifteen, nine plus six is fifteen, fifteen is three mod twelve

41:13.000 --> 41:16.000
because they leave the same remainder when you divide by twelve.

41:16.000 --> 41:19.000
And seventeen is five mod twelve.

41:19.000 --> 41:24.000
And another way of saying this is that A minus B can be divided by n.

41:26.000 --> 41:29.000
Gauss worked out all the rules for this type of arithmetic.

41:30.000 --> 41:34.000
But we don't have to stick to arithmetic mod twelve.

41:34.000 --> 41:37.000
We can also use it for the seven days of the week.

41:37.000 --> 41:42.000
For example, if it's Thursday, then in four days it would be Monday.

41:43.000 --> 41:48.000
And if it's Saturday, then in three days it would be Tuesday.

41:49.000 --> 41:55.000
If we number the days of the week from day zero Sunday, day one is Monday,

41:55.000 --> 42:00.000
up to day six, which is Saturday, we can then write these statements

42:00.000 --> 42:06.000
as Thursday plus four days is Monday, four plus one is one mod seven.

42:07.000 --> 42:12.000
Saturday plus three days is Tuesday, six plus three is two mod seven.

42:15.000 --> 42:21.000
Well, using this idea, we can carry out calculations on the calendar.

42:22.000 --> 42:25.000
Several people have produced methods for finding the day of the week

42:25.000 --> 42:28.000
for a given date, including Gauss himself

42:29.000 --> 42:33.000
and also the mathematician John Conway, who died earlier this year.

42:34.000 --> 42:39.000
Here's a method devised by Charles Dodgson, better known as Lewis Carroll,

42:39.000 --> 42:42.000
the author of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,

42:42.000 --> 42:45.000
and it was published under his pen name.

42:45.000 --> 42:49.000
So let's see how it works in detail, first quickly in general

42:49.000 --> 42:53.000
and then more slowly for a specific date.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
So let's have a look at this.

42:58.000 --> 43:01.000
Carroll's method is based on four numbers,

43:01.000 --> 43:04.000
which are then added mod seven.

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
The first number is the century number.

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
What century we in?

43:10.000 --> 43:13.000
To find this, we divide the first two digits of the year,

43:13.000 --> 43:16.000
in our case 20, by four,

43:17.000 --> 43:21.000
subtract the remainder from three and double the result.

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
Next is the year number.

43:25.000 --> 43:30.000
Here Carroll's rule is to divide the last two digits of the year by 12,

43:30.000 --> 43:33.000
and then add the quotient, the remainder,

43:33.000 --> 43:36.000
and the number of times that four divides into the remainder.

43:36.000 --> 43:39.000
You'll see how this works in a minute.

43:41.000 --> 43:45.000
Third is the month number, where Carroll gave a complicated rule,

43:45.000 --> 43:48.000
but it's easier just to memorise this table of numbers.

43:49.000 --> 43:53.000
And last is the day number, which is just the day of the month.

43:54.000 --> 43:57.000
And there's also an extra condition which we won't need today.

43:57.000 --> 44:01.000
So let's see how this works in practice.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
And if it seems rather complicated,

44:03.000 --> 44:08.000
Carroll himself claimed to be able to apply it in his head in around 20 seconds.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
So let's see how it works for today's date,

44:12.000 --> 44:16.000
the 28th of September 2020, as you can see on the right.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
So here the general method is on the left,

44:18.000 --> 44:21.000
and we'll work through it, and the example is on the right.

44:21.000 --> 44:27.000
For the century number, we take the first two digits of the year.

44:27.000 --> 44:31.000
The year is 2020, so the first two digits are 20,

44:31.000 --> 44:37.000
and divide it by four, giving a remainder of zero.

44:37.000 --> 44:42.000
Subtracting this remainder zero from three gives three,

44:42.000 --> 44:45.000
and doubling the result gives six.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
So six is our century number.

44:47.000 --> 44:53.000
For the year number, we take the last two digits of the year,

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
which is also 20 for 2020,

44:55.000 --> 45:00.000
divide it by 12, giving one remainder eight.

45:01.000 --> 45:04.000
Also four divides into eight two times,

45:04.000 --> 45:09.000
so we have one plus eight plus two, and that's 11.

45:12.000 --> 45:16.000
For the month number, the number for September is five.

45:17.000 --> 45:22.000
And for the day number, the 28, it's 28.

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
And if you add all these numbers together,

45:24.000 --> 45:29.000
you get six plus 11 plus five plus 28, which is 50.

45:29.000 --> 45:33.000
And 50 is one more than a multiple of seven.

45:33.000 --> 45:39.000
So the answer is one, which is Monday, which is correct.

45:43.000 --> 45:46.000
How about the question I posed earlier?

45:47.000 --> 45:52.000
In which years of the century does February have five Sundays?

45:52.000 --> 45:56.000
For this to happen, February must have 29 days,

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
so it must be a leap year.

45:58.000 --> 46:02.000
Now the first of January 2001 was a Monday,

46:02.000 --> 46:05.000
or you can start with any other date whose day you know.

46:05.000 --> 46:10.000
So you can easily check that the first of February was a Thursday.

46:10.000 --> 46:14.000
Now the number of days in any non-leap year is 365,

46:14.000 --> 46:17.000
which is one more than a multiple of seven.

46:17.000 --> 46:20.000
So the first of February 2001 was a Thursday,

46:20.000 --> 46:23.000
first of February 2002 is a Friday,

46:23.000 --> 46:26.000
first of February 2003 is a Saturday,

46:26.000 --> 46:29.000
and first of February 2004 is a Sunday.

46:29.000 --> 46:32.000
So that's one answer, 2004.

46:32.000 --> 46:35.000
Also the cycle of days repeats every 28 years,

46:35.000 --> 46:38.000
because the total number of days in 28 years

46:38.000 --> 46:44.000
is 28 times 365 plus seven leap days,

46:44.000 --> 46:47.000
and this is exactly divisible by seven.

46:47.000 --> 46:59.000
So adding 28 years to 2004 gives 2032, 2060, 2088.

47:01.000 --> 47:04.000
So the only years in the century where February has five Sundays

47:04.000 --> 47:09.000
is 2004, 2032, 2060 and 2088.

47:15.000 --> 47:18.000
For my final topic, I want to look at another result of Fermat

47:18.000 --> 47:21.000
and the generalisation of it by Euler.

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
If parts of this get too technical,

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
don't worry about the details,

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
but try to follow the general story.

47:30.000 --> 47:33.000
One form of Fermat's little theorem, as it's often called,

47:34.000 --> 47:37.000
tells us that if you choose any whole number A

47:37.000 --> 47:40.000
and any prime number P

47:40.000 --> 47:45.000
and calculate A to the power P minus A,

47:45.000 --> 47:49.000
then the result is always exactly divisible by P.

47:51.000 --> 47:54.000
For example, if we choose A to be eight

47:54.000 --> 47:57.000
and the prime P to be 37,

47:57.000 --> 48:00.000
then we find without calculating it

48:00.000 --> 48:05.000
that eight to the 37 minus eight is exactly divisible by 37.

48:08.000 --> 48:11.000
And we can also get another version of Fermat's result,

48:11.000 --> 48:14.000
which we'll need in a moment, by dividing by A,

48:14.000 --> 48:17.000
and we can do this if P doesn't divide A.

48:17.000 --> 48:20.000
And it tells us that eight to the P minus one,

48:20.000 --> 48:24.000
minus one, is also exactly divisible by P.

48:25.000 --> 48:31.000
For example, when A is two and P is 53,

48:31.000 --> 48:35.000
we see that two to the power 52 minus one

48:35.000 --> 48:38.000
is exactly divisible by 53,

48:38.000 --> 48:42.000
which we can also write using our clock arithmetic

48:42.000 --> 48:47.000
as two to the 52 is one mod 53.

48:47.000 --> 48:50.000
And I'm going to use that result in a minute.

48:51.000 --> 48:55.000
But before that, how do we prove Fermat's little theorem?

48:56.000 --> 48:59.000
We can do so using algebra,

48:59.000 --> 49:02.000
but here's a different method that I rather like

49:02.000 --> 49:06.000
by counting necklaces, coloured necklaces.

49:06.000 --> 49:10.000
Our necklaces will have P beads

49:10.000 --> 49:13.000
and there are A colours available,

49:13.000 --> 49:17.000
and in our colourings we're going to use at least two colours.

49:18.000 --> 49:21.000
First of all, notice, as you can see on the left,

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
that necklaces can be rotated.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
So the necklace on the left,

49:25.000 --> 49:29.000
which is red, blue, red, red, yellow,

49:29.000 --> 49:32.000
is the same as if we start with blue,

49:32.000 --> 49:35.000
blue, red, red, yellow, red,

49:35.000 --> 49:39.000
and also the same as the other ones shown on the left.

49:41.000 --> 49:44.000
Now how many strings of coloured beads can there be?

49:45.000 --> 49:50.000
Well, the total number is you've got A colours for the first bead,

49:50.000 --> 49:53.000
A for the second bead, A for the third and so on.

49:53.000 --> 49:57.000
So that gives us a total of A to the power P for P beads.

49:59.000 --> 50:02.000
But we must exclude all the strings in just one colour,

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
such as red, red, red, red, red,

50:04.000 --> 50:07.000
and there are A of these, one for each colour.

50:07.000 --> 50:13.000
So this seems to give us A to the P minus A strings of beads.

50:14.000 --> 50:17.000
But we're taking these and making them into necklaces,

50:17.000 --> 50:20.000
and for necklaces each one is counted P times over.

50:20.000 --> 50:23.000
So we have to divide that number by P.

50:23.000 --> 50:26.000
So the number of different coloured necklaces

50:26.000 --> 50:29.000
is A to the P minus A divided by P.

50:32.000 --> 50:35.000
But the number must be, it must be a whole number.

50:35.000 --> 50:39.000
So A to the P minus A must be exactly divisible by P,

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
as we wanted to prove.

50:44.000 --> 50:48.000
And we can use this result to tell us about the shuffling of cards.

50:50.000 --> 50:53.000
Starting with a normal pack of cards we can do a riffle shuffle,

50:53.000 --> 50:56.000
that is we divide into two piles as shown in the middle,

50:56.000 --> 51:00.000
and then shuffle it so the cards in the two piles alternate

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
as shown on the right.

51:03.000 --> 51:06.000
Now if you carry on shuffling the pack in the same way,

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
how many shuffles do you need

51:08.000 --> 51:12.000
before every card returns to its original position?

51:13.000 --> 51:16.000
We can answer this with Fermat's little theorem.

51:19.000 --> 51:22.000
Where does each card move after the first shuffle?

51:22.000 --> 51:25.000
You can check that the card originally in position X

51:25.000 --> 51:28.000
moves to position 2X,

51:28.000 --> 51:33.000
or to position 2X mod 53 when 2X is larger than 52.

51:35.000 --> 51:38.000
For example, the card that starts in position 1

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
ends up in position 2.

51:44.000 --> 51:47.000
And the card that starts in position 27

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
moves to position 54,

51:50.000 --> 51:54.000
which mod 53 is position 1.

51:55.000 --> 51:59.000
So the new ordering of the cards, as shown on the right,

51:59.000 --> 52:04.000
is 271, 282, 293 and so on,

52:04.000 --> 52:09.000
to 51, 25, 52, 26.

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
So after one shuffle,

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
the card in position X

52:14.000 --> 52:18.000
has moved to position 2X mod 53.

52:19.000 --> 52:26.000
And after two shuffles, it then moves to position 4X mod 53 and so on.

52:26.000 --> 52:33.000
So after n shuffles, it moves to position 2 to the nX mod 53.

52:34.000 --> 52:37.000
And if the pack has now returned to its original order,

52:37.000 --> 52:40.000
this must be the same as position X.

52:41.000 --> 52:44.000
And that's true for each card.

52:44.000 --> 52:51.000
So 2 to the n times X is the same as X mod 53 for each card, in each case.

52:51.000 --> 52:57.000
If we now divide by X, this tells us that 2 to the n is 1 mod 53.

52:57.000 --> 53:01.000
And we want to find the numbers n for which this is true.

53:02.000 --> 53:05.000
But as we saw before, with Fermat's little theorem,

53:05.000 --> 53:08.000
2 to the 52 is 1 mod 53.

53:08.000 --> 53:13.000
So the pack is returned to its original order after 52 shuffles.

53:16.000 --> 53:19.000
But is that the smallest possible number of shuffles?

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
Well, if it happened after fewer shuffles,

53:21.000 --> 53:26.000
then the number of shuffles would have to divide 52, it turns out.

53:26.000 --> 53:30.000
And you can check, as I've done below, that none of them works.

53:30.000 --> 53:33.000
So the answer to this question is 52.

53:35.000 --> 53:38.000
But the question I posed at the beginning of the lecture

53:38.000 --> 53:42.000
was involved shuffling a pack with two jokers.

53:43.000 --> 53:46.000
So we now have 54 cards.

53:46.000 --> 53:54.000
And doing what we did earlier tells us that 2 to the n is now 1 mod 55 instead of mod 53.

53:55.000 --> 53:58.000
But this time we can't use Fermat's little theorem

53:58.000 --> 54:01.000
to deduce that the smallest number of shuffles is 54

54:01.000 --> 54:04.000
because 55 isn't a prime number.

54:06.000 --> 54:09.000
So how do we get round this difficulty?

54:10.000 --> 54:14.000
Well, if 55 divides exactly into 2 to the n minus 1,

54:14.000 --> 54:18.000
then so do 5 and 11, and these are both primes.

54:18.000 --> 54:21.000
So we can apply Fermat's little theorem to each one,

54:21.000 --> 54:25.000
telling us that 2 to the 4 is 1 mod 5.

54:26.000 --> 54:31.000
And 2 to the 10 is 1 mod 11.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
How do we combine these?

54:33.000 --> 54:37.000
Raising the first one to the fifth power tells us that 2 to the 20 is 1 mod 5,

54:37.000 --> 54:42.000
and squaring the second one tells us 2 to the 20 is also 1 mod 11.

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
And combining these, which we're allowed to do,

54:44.000 --> 54:48.000
tells us that 2 to the 20 is 1 mod 55.

54:48.000 --> 54:53.000
So the pack is restored to its original order after 20 shuffles.

54:53.000 --> 55:00.000
And we can check as before that no smaller number of shuffles works.

55:00.000 --> 55:06.000
So the answer to our original problem is 20 shuffles.

55:06.000 --> 55:09.000
Raymond, can you possibly add a piece of paper?

55:09.000 --> 55:15.000
We've just used Fermat's result that the prime p does not divide the number a,

55:15.000 --> 55:19.000
then h to the p minus 1 can be divided exactly by p.

55:19.000 --> 55:24.000
That is, h to the p minus 1 is 1 mod p.

55:24.000 --> 55:28.000
But what can we say if we replace p by a number that isn't prime?

55:29.000 --> 55:32.000
Unlikely, as it may seem, and we'll see in a minute,

55:32.000 --> 55:35.000
our answer, which is due to Euler, arises in cryptography,

55:35.000 --> 55:39.000
which will be our final example and is fundamental in such security issues

55:39.000 --> 55:42.000
as how our credit cards be kept safe.

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
So number theory can be used to solve problems

55:44.000 --> 55:49.000
that are even more important than the shuffling of cards.

55:49.000 --> 55:53.000
Now, just as Fermat's result tells us that the number a raised to the power p minus 1

55:53.000 --> 55:56.000
is 1 mod multiple p.

55:56.000 --> 56:01.000
So Euler's more general formula tells us that for two numbers a and n,

56:01.000 --> 56:06.000
a raised to some power is 1 more than the multiple of n.

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
But what is this power?

56:08.000 --> 56:12.000
It's called Euler's totion function, or phi function,

56:12.000 --> 56:18.000
denoted at Gauss's suggestion by the Greek letter phi.

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
Given any whole number n,

56:20.000 --> 56:25.000
phi of n counts the numbers up to n that have no factors in common with n.

56:25.000 --> 56:29.000
For example, if n is 10, the number with factors in common with 10

56:29.000 --> 56:34.000
are the even numbers 2, 4, 6 and 8, and the numbers 5 and 10 itself.

56:34.000 --> 56:37.000
So the only numbers with no factors in common with 10

56:37.000 --> 56:40.000
are 1, 3, 7 and 9, and there are four of them.

56:40.000 --> 56:43.000
So phi of 10 is 4.

56:43.000 --> 56:47.000
Likewise, if n is 12, then the numbers who count are 1,

56:47.000 --> 56:54.000
not 2, 3 or 4, 5, not 6, 7, not 8, 9 or 10, 11, not 12,

56:54.000 --> 56:57.000
so phi of 12 is also 4.

56:57.000 --> 57:00.000
And we can easily check that for any prime number p,

57:00.000 --> 57:04.000
phi of p is p minus 1 because we don't count p itself.

57:04.000 --> 57:07.000
And this tells us that if p is prime,

57:07.000 --> 57:12.000
then Euler's theorem reduces to Fermat's theorem, which we had above.

57:12.000 --> 57:15.000
And we can also prove that if p and q are both primes,

57:15.000 --> 57:20.000
then phi of their product, pq, is p minus 1 times q minus 1.

57:20.000 --> 57:23.000
For example, and we'll need this in a minute,

57:23.000 --> 57:28.000
1,073 is the product of the primes 29 and 37.

57:28.000 --> 57:33.000
So phi of 1,073 is 29 minus 1 times 37 minus 1,

57:33.000 --> 57:39.000
28 times 36 or 1,08.

57:39.000 --> 57:45.000
So now at last, in the last five minutes, to our credit cards.

57:45.000 --> 57:48.000
RSA cryptography is named after the initials of Revesh,

57:48.000 --> 57:51.000
Shamir, a Edelman, who found it in 1978,

57:51.000 --> 57:54.000
not knowing that it had earlier been invented at Bletchley Park

57:54.000 --> 57:57.000
by Cliff Cox, but kept secret.

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
Now this may look daunting,

57:59.000 --> 58:02.000
but don't worry too much about the details just yet.

58:02.000 --> 58:06.000
The main points are that the whole process of securing your credit cards

58:06.000 --> 58:09.000
appears on this one page,

58:09.000 --> 58:13.000
and that at one stage it uses Euler's theorem.

58:13.000 --> 58:16.000
It also relies on the fact that we can easily multiply

58:16.000 --> 58:19.000
two prime numbers together,

58:19.000 --> 58:22.000
but we can't usually go the other way around.

58:22.000 --> 58:26.000
Even we can multiply 7 and 13 to give 91,

58:26.000 --> 58:31.000
but turning it around, factorising 91 and 7 plus times 13,

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
wasn't immediately obvious.

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
And for large primes,

58:35.000 --> 58:38.000
multiplying is effectively a one-way process,

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
like squeezing toothpaste from a tube

58:40.000 --> 58:43.000
or breaking eggs to make an omelet.

58:43.000 --> 58:48.000
So let me now just explain why your credit cards are safe.

58:48.000 --> 58:52.000
Suppose that Alice wishes to send a secret message to Bob

58:52.000 --> 58:56.000
in such a way that it cannot be intercepted by an eavesdropper,

58:56.000 --> 58:59.000
sometimes called Eve.

58:59.000 --> 59:03.000
Bob first selects two prime, large primes,

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
with maybe 200 digits each,

59:05.000 --> 59:09.000
and multiplies them to give the number N is PQ.

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
In our simplified example,

59:11.000 --> 59:14.000
P and Q were 29 and 37,

59:14.000 --> 59:19.000
and N is their product 1,073.

59:19.000 --> 59:22.000
Bob then calculates 5N, as we did earlier,

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
and we got 1,088.

59:24.000 --> 59:29.000
And he then chooses a number E with no factors in common with it.

59:29.000 --> 59:33.000
Here he's chosen E to be 11.

59:33.000 --> 59:36.000
He then publicly announces the two numbers,

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
capital N and E,

59:38.000 --> 59:42.000
but not P and Q, its factors, which only he knows.

59:42.000 --> 59:46.000
So N and E are the public key,

59:46.000 --> 59:50.000
which is known to anyone who wants to find it out.

59:50.000 --> 59:55.000
Now, to encode her message, Alice first converts it to numerical form,

59:55.000 --> 59:58.000
for example, by taking A as 1, B as 2, and so on,

59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.000
and calls it capital M.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.000
So M is the message.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
When E and capital N,

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:10.000
she then calculates M to the power E,

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:14.000
and takes the result mod N and causes capital E.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:19.000
This is her coded message, which she sends to Bob.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
So she knows E and N,

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
and she knows her own message M,

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
she calculates N to the E mod N,

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:30.000
and that's the message that she sends to Bob.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Bob now has to decode it,

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:36.000
because E and phi of N have no factors in common,

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.000
it can be shown that there are numbers...

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Whoops.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Because E and phi of N have no factors in common,

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000
it can be shown that there are numbers little M and little N,

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
satisfying this equation here,

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.000
so that M times E is 1 mod phi N,

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.000
and from this, he can calculate M.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:04.000
So, basically, there's a method of calculating this number, little M.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:09.000
In our example, 11M was 1 mod 1008,

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:13.000
and Bob can then calculate M to be 275.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:16.000
And this is where Euler's theorem comes in.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.000
M to the power phi N is 1 mod phi N.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
And it follows from this by a line of algebra,

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
which I won't go into,

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:30.000
that calculating E to the M mod N gives Alice's message M.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Alice's message is E to the, in this case, 2 to the 75 mod 1073.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Don't worry about the details.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:44.000
The important thing is that the whole process simply relies on two calculations.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Alice calculates N to the E mod N,

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Bob calculates E to the M mod N,

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:56.000
and that is the whole of the reason that your credit card is secure.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:00.000
And I hope you'll remember that next time you use your credit card.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:04.000
And if not, then the obvious place to look it up,

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.000
and all the other topics and problems I've been talking about,

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:11.000
and much else besides, is in the book I've been launching today.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.000
May I encourage you to give it to all your friends for Christmas

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.000
in order to solve your Christmas present problems for this year?

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:21.000
Moreover, you'll probably lose all your friends as a result,

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.000
so this will solve your Christmas present problems next year too.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Thank you for listening.
