And nobody can agree about what that was,
which I enjoy telling my students because it's a problem for them.
I can highlight where the answer might lie,
but I like to try to get this across to the public as much as possible as well.
Because we live in a managerial age,
where we try and say what the solution is going to be,
and then we do the research to get to the solution.
That's not how science works.
Y ffact is, we really don't know a great deal about why life evolved the way it actually did.
And I also find it encouraging that some of the greatest biologists and the greatest thinkers of the 20th century can't agree on them, themselves either.

If you're not familiar with it, it's usually called the universal energy currency.
You can think of it as a kind of coin that goes in the slot machine,
and the slot machine does its thing, it's an enzyme, it does a particular job,
you put the coin in, it does its job, you put another coin in, it does its job again.
So this is how cells work, they're powered by machines, using effectively the currency, the ATP.
So this idea that it's kind of like a hydroelectric power scheme,
came from one of the most brilliant and eccentric Englishmen of the 20th century scientists, Peter Mitchell.
And he put these ideas forward initially in 1961.
This is somewhat before that, that's the late 1940s when he was in Cambridge,
with Jennifer Moyle, who was a lifelong collaborator.
She was, in fact, a brilliant experimentalist.
Mitchell was a brilliant thinker, and rather cac-handed in the lab, I'm told.
And so it was Jennifer Moyle who really did all the experiments,
and Mitchell who did a lot of the thinking, and Moyle herself was brilliant.
She was one of the first women to get a...
Actually, she was not awarded a degree in Cambridge,
they didn't award degrees to women in the 1940s.
But an equivalent, I don't recall what the term is.
She had been involved in cracking codes in the war and had been head of some division,
which again was very unusual for a woman to be in that position at that time.
The Nobel Prize went to Mitchell in the end by himself.
There's always arguments about how these things should be apportioned.
I don't know enough about it, but I think if it were today, it would have gone to both of them.
And science is really about experiments as much as it is about thinking.
It's the combination of the two.
If it hadn't been for her, experiments Mitchell's ideas would have really come to nothing.
Anyway, but Mitchell was a great thinker,
and he came at these questions about how cell respiration works.
From thinking about bacteria, his real question on bacteria
was how do they keep their insides different to their outsides?
It's a very simple, basic question,
and one of those great questions that takes decades to answer.
He gave a talk in Moscow in 1957 on the origin of life.
There was a whole conference on the origin of life,
and a lot of the people who were interested in that kind of question at the time were there,
so JD Bernal and JBS Haldane, they're all communists actually,
and they all went to Moscow,
and they were interested in Moscow in a materialist explanation for the world,
which is why a lot of the people who were working on those questions shared this materialist conception.
Mitchell was there, and he was far from being a materialist.
He was quite kind of almost a spiritualist in his outlook,
but he said, I cannot consider the organism without its environment.
From a formal point of view, the two may be regarded as equivalent phases
between which dynamic contact is maintained by the membranes that separate and link them.
Virtually every definition of life that you will ever see is going to say,
this is what an organism is, and the environment is something different.
Mitchell really here is saying that the environment and the organism
are two equivalent phases separated by a membrane.
It's a very different perception of what life is.
If you're thinking about the origin of life,
and you're beginning to think about compartments and phases and things,
this kind of conception makes, to me, a lot more sense.
It's not a satisfying definition of life,
but it certainly gives you a different perspective
that on opposite sides of a membrane, which is a millionth of a millimetre in thickness,
you have two phases.
One is the inside of the cell, the other is the outside of the cell.
They are different, and the only way they can be different
is if you actively pumping things out or bringing things in,
and that costs energy.
How do the first cells do it?
Well, you can see it.
The clue is in methane,
so the cows produce massive amounts of methane.
They do it because they harbour particular types of archaea,
so it represents this domain of life called methanogens.
We all have methanogens as well,
especially those of you who can light your own for hot.
So these are methanogens, and what they're doing is
they're taking carbon dioxide and hydrogen
and reacting them together to make methane,
and they're getting all the energy and all the carbon
that they need to grow from that reaction alone.
So the methane is the waste product,
and it's just farted out, I suppose.
But you'll all probably be aware that if we could make hydrogen and CO2 react easily,
we could solve a lot of problems in the world.
So we already can split water.
We can effectively mimic photosynthesis,
split water to produce hydrogen and oxygen,
which is what photosynthesis does.
We can forget about the oxygen
or react it directly with the hydrogen,
but nobody's particularly interested in the hydrogen economy.
It's a difficult thing to do.
If you could react the hydrogen with CO2 and make synthetic gasoline,
that would solve a lot of problems.
You can strip the CO2 out of the atmosphere,
or at least remain a neutral state,
and you can make the entire plastics industry
and all the energy and so on
can be done from this reaction.
To my knowledge, nobody has succeeded in doing it in an economic way.
Perhaps they have, and they're not telling us.
But the cells, these methanogens,
they grow from that without any energy input at the door.
So they can make it work economically,
and it's interesting to wonder how they do it.
Well, the way they actually do it
is they need a proton gradient across a membrane.
That's to say they're doing exactly the same thing
that we do in our mitochondria.
They're pumping protons across a membrane,
so on one side they've got a high proton concentration,
the other side they don't.
And they use that, not to make ATP,
they do use it to make ATP, but more importantly,
they use it to power the reaction
between hydrogen and carbon dioxide.
And this is roughly what the issue is.
Don't worry about this.
If it's going uphill, you have to put energy in.
If it's going downhill, you're getting energy out.
That's really all you need to take home from this.
But there's two lines on there,
and right at the top you can see it says H-C-H-O.
That's formaldehyde.
So to go from carbon dioxide to methane,
you have to put energy in for the first couple of steps
to get up to formaldehyde.
And then it's energetically downhill all the way.
So that's the problem.
That uphill bit is the difficulty
with making hydrogen react with CO2.
There's a barrier to their reaction, an energetic barrier.
And what the methanogens do is they lower that barrier
and they lower it by using a proton gradient.
So how do they actually do it?
Well, to think about it is a very good way
to think about the origin of life.
Because these same conditions,
you find them in a particular type of hydrothermal vent.
We see natural proton gradients,
barriers between compartments,
lots of hydrogen gas and CO2.
And those cells live in that kind of environment even today.
And so you can begin to think,
well, how would the structure of this environment begin to help?
And it gives us an insight into how they might do it
and also how we might do it.
So this particular type of vent,
we're only discovered about 15 years ago or so.
Let me just go back to that.
They don't look much like the familiar black smokers
that most people have seen,
belching black smoke out of the top.
I suppose you could call them white nonsmokers.
There's no smoke coming out
and they carbonate limestone rocks, really, aragonite, in fact.
But they are very active.
And there's no animal life around it in particular.
There are a few fish every now and then,
but they're full of bacteria and archaea
and the kind of cells that live there.
And this kind of environment,
we're fairly sure would have existed on the early earth as well.
So the black smokers were not so certain about,
but these type of vents would certainly have been present
four billion years ago on the early earth.
And they were first pointed out by this guy, Mike Russell,
who's a kind of mad geologist.
He's a brilliant scientist,
but he enjoys winding people up, I think.
And some of his ideas...
The origin of life is a really fractured field
and people come in from the background with chemistry, for example,
or a background of geology,
or a background of biology, or a background of genetics.
People come from very different places
and converge on these questions about the origin of life.
So it's not surprising that we don't agree with each other very much.
Often we don't even speak the same language.
I think most people are trying to learn to speak the same language,
but we can't agree even then what the real question is,
because it's a long way to go from simple chemical reactions
to a replicating cell with all of this machinery.
Which bit are you going to focus on?
We're all interested in different aspects of really different problems,
all of which goes under this term, origin of life.
So Mike Russell was talking about these kind of vents
ten years before they were actually discovered.
And the language he used was the language of geochemistry.
And it was really an unfamiliar language
to most chemists working on the subject, or to the biologists.
I struggled a lot with his terms to begin with.
And then they discovered, Deb Kelly in fact,
discovered this lost city vent that I just showed you the picture of.
Ten years after he'd been talking about these vents
as the best setting for the origin of life.
And suddenly he became famous, almost overnight he became famous.
And this was a photoshop job that nature did.
So nature is one of the great science journals.
And they had a feature article on Mike's work
and dressed him up as Erasmus, as the renaissance man.
And they called him nasance man, nasance as in the birth of life.
And he built a reactor at NASA, JPL, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
to try and study these conditions.
And here's a little bit of lost city vent in the background.
He made a number of predictions as to what the important conditions were.
And the key ones really is that they should be very rich in hydrogen gas,
which is true.
And that there should be the walls of the ancient vents,
not the modern ones, but the ancient ones should have contained
catalytic iron sulfur minerals.
That also seems to be true.
But the main point that he was talking about
is there were natural proton gradients.
Because you have alkaline fluids, which really don't have many protons.
They're deficient in protons.
And a relatively acidic early ocean.
Lots of carbon dioxide, full of protons.
And so the two were mingling inside these vents.
And you would have very steep proton gradients within the vents.
We don't really know how steep.
We don't know a great deal about these vents.
But you can at least imagine how it might work.
Essentially what the methanogens are doing and how, in essence,
the proton concentration changes the reactivity of both hydrogen and CO2.
In alkaline fluids, hydrogen is more reactive.
It wants to offload its electrons onto something else.
And in acidic conditions, CO2 is more reactive.
It's going to accept the electrons because it can accept protons
to balance the charges as well.
And so if you've got two channels next to each other,
the CO2 in acid conditions is going to be more receptive
to picking up electrons and protons and becoming an organic molecule.
And if you have hydrogen in an alkaline channel,
it really wants to be rid of its electrons.
And the protons will react with the hydroxide ions to make water,
which is thermodynamically very favoured.
But if they mix, then, of course, you've lost that.
You've lost the structure. You've lost the barrier.
You don't have a pH difference anymore.
And so you've lost everything. It's the structure that really matters.
And it's the structure that we have here.
And these minerals that we think you would have found in these ancient vents
in which you find today in methanogens are the ion-sulfur minerals.
And they're semiconducting.
So you could imagine, at least,
that the hydrogen would pass electrons onto this barrier
and across the barrier onto CO2.
And that it's equivalent to a cell membrane,
and it's the same structure as a cell membrane,
and this is how methanogens might do it.
Well, you could call that a wild bit of imagination,
or you could call it a hypothesis.
A hypothesis, I think Peter Meddewa said,
is a rash leap into the unknown,
but at least it's testable.
That's what makes it science.
And so we built a little reactor.
It's a very humble reactor, really,
and it doesn't work very well.
But we've been playing with this for a few years now,
and we've decided that we need to build a better one.
We need to make it smaller.
We're actually now building a microfluidic version of this,
but I'm only showing you this version for two reasons.
One of them, we can precipitate the right kind of minerals
inside these little vent structures here.
And the second one is we're trying to simulate the conditions
where we have hydrogen and alkaline fluids on the inside
with a semiconducting barrier and CO2 in acidic fluids on the other side,
and that should drive the formation of organic matter.
And this is formaldehyde,
which is the top of that curve that I showed you a few minutes ago.
This is the hard point, so we're not especially interested in formaldehyde,
but if you can make that, you can make anything.
And this is only two hours.
So under those conditions,
we're seeing a substantial rise in formaldehyde.
The trouble with this is trying to keep the conditions
under any form of control, and so we're trying to do it better.
We've not even published that yet.
So I'm not going to talk about that,
but I'd like to think what are the consequences,
if, big if, what I'm telling you is true,
that life started in these hydrothermal vents,
and they started there because the structure of these vents
favours the reaction between hydrogen and CO2,
the proton gradients across membranes or across barriers,
because that's still how cells work.
And cells now get their hydrogen from almost anywhere.
So in photosynthesis, it splits water,
and the hydrogen is extracted from water,
and it's cobbled onto CO2 to make organic molecules.
But the basic reaction is hydrogen reacting with CO2
in oxygenic photosynthesis, where the waste product is oxygen.
But there's other types of photosynthesis.
You can use hydrogen sulfide as an electron donor.
You take the hydrogen out of it, you leave the sulfur behind,
you cobble it onto CO2,
or you're growing like a methanogen in the vent.
The hydrogen is bubbling out of the ground,
you simply cobble it onto CO2.
Life all across Earth is based on the reaction
between hydrogen and CO2.
And we go round eating things,
but we're entirely dependent on the primary producers,
the plants and the bacteria,
which are basically reacting hydrogen with CO2.
Hydrogen and CO2 don't react
except under these rather careful conditions,
where you have structure,
the same kind of structure that we see in cells.
So how common are those conditions likely to be?
On the early Earth, we think that they would have been
basically all the way across the sea floor.
Because it's a reaction between rock and water.
So this is, if you imagine this is the sea floor,
and then down beneath in the crust underneath the sea floor,
these green rocks here are rich in minerals like olivine.
So olivine is iron, magnesium rich rock,
mostly found in the mantle of the Earth today,
which is why you don't see so many reactions like this anymore,
but four billion years ago there wasn't really such a difference
between the mantle and the crust.
So we think these reactions would happen almost everywhere.
The water percolates down to depths of five or six kilometres
beneath the crust, and will react with these rocks.
So if you were to take a lump of olivine
and put it in a bucket of water,
you'd probably get one bubble in about a week's time.
It's not something, you know,
it's not an experiment you want to do for the kids.
But at the higher temperatures and pressures
down at the bottom of the sea floor,
it really is bubbling with hydrogen gas.
It's a pretty vigorous reaction.
And that's really all it takes.
It's the reaction between water and rock
to produce strongly alkaline fluids rich in hydrogen gas.
It's an exothermic reaction,
which means it's producing heat,
and so these are buoyant warm fluids which percolate back up.
And when they get to the sea floor,
they react with the waters of the ocean,
the minerals in the ocean to precipitate as these vents.
So the reaction between rock and water is down below the sea floor,
but the vents themselves are up at the sea floor.
So they should happen on any wet rocky planet.
And there's actually quite a lot of lovely suggestions
from across our own solar system that they do happen.
So Mars, there's traces of methane,
thought to be traces of methane on Mars.
Where does it come from?
The wishful thinkers hope it comes from life.
It's possible it does.
But it's more likely that it comes from exactly this same process
of rocks reacting with water.
There is water on Mars still,
mostly frozen and mostly beneath the surface.
But you're likely to produce hydrogen and methane
for exactly the same reasons.
And we see on Enceladus, for example, or Europa,
which are moons, icy moons, with frozen oceans.
But underneath the frozen ocean on Enceladus and on Europa,
it seems that there is a rather large ocean,
larger than the Earth's oceans.
And these plumes that you can see here
are escaping from the surface of Enceladus.
And they are very alkaline, pH 10, or thereabouts,
and rich in hydrogen, gas and methane.
And so the only thing that we know of,
the only geological process we know of
that could produce an ocean that was that alkaline
and that rich in hydrogen would be this same process.
It's called serpentinisation,
but it's the reaction between olivine and water
to produce a mineral called serpentinite,
which is why it's called serpentinisation.
So even in our own solar system,
there are at least three worlds
where this process is actively going on.
And this is really one of the places
that NASA would most like to go to, me too.
And it actually also means,
because of the politics of these situations,
I said nobody can agree about where life actually started on Earth
or what conditions.
So I'm giving you my partial view.
NASA like this partial view
because NASA want to fly rockets to Enceladus,
and they need a reason why they would want to do that,
a reason that they can give, I suppose,
rather than we just like flying rockets.
And that's their maybe life on Enceladus.
But that means that these reasons,
these ideas on the origin of life,
talking about serpentinisation and hydrogen
and these particular reactions
is appealing at the moment to NASA.
I hope that means they might fund me,
but probably not.
Anyway, so that's within our own solar system.
If we go further afield,
there's been a real drive
to discover exoplanets,
planets orbiting distant stars.
And there have been projections now
that there should be something in the order of tens of billions
of Earth-like wet rocky planets
in the Milky Way alone.
So if that's true,
all of these Earth-like wet rocky planets
should be producing the same kind of vents.
Water is basically ubiquitous.
We can detect oliveene in interstellar dust.
It's very common,
so most rocky planets would have a fair amount of oliveene in them.
And CO2, again, is common as an atmospheric gas,
certainly in our own solar system.
So you could imagine that these same conditions
would apply really on a very, very wide scale.
And so life starting elsewhere
may be constrained by the same reasons.
We also require proton gradients across membranes
to get going because the reaction between hydrogen and CO2
is difficult,
and this is a probabilistically simple way of doing it.
So if you were to find, say, a thousand life forms in the universe,
would it be carbon-based or not?
Probably it would mostly be carbon-based
because carbon is ubiquitous.
It's extremely good at the kind of complex chemistry
that needs to be done.
And it comes in a convenient LEGO brick, CO2.
So you can build large complex molecules
by adding on one brick at a time.
If you start with silicon,
you're starting with silicon oxide, sand.
Don't try and build with sand.
You want to build with LEGO.
And carbon dioxide is a LEGO brick.
And so if you were to find a thousand different life forms,
I would wader a bet that it's going to be carbon-based,
let's say, 995 times out of a thousand,
and something wild and funky,
perhaps the rest of the times.
But carbon is so common, so good at what it does,
and so convenient in the forms in which it comes,
that it would be very surprising if it wasn't carbon-based.
But then we've already run into this constraint.
How do you make carbon dioxide react with CO2?
I would say we're likely to find bacteria
many places throughout the universe.
But what about more complex things than bacteria?
I don't know how many people in this room
would get very excited if there were bacteria discovered on Mars.
Most scientists probably would get pretty excited about that.
I don't...
I really honestly...
Can we have a show of hands just out of curiosity?
How many people here would be excited to find bacteria on another planet?
Pretty much all of you. Great.
Would we find anything more complex than bacteria?
We need to look back, though,
on what I've accomplished, what I'm suggesting is a set of constraints
that cells anywhere are going to be based on reacting hydrogen with CO2,
and to do it, they're going to need proton gradients across membranes.
And bacteria have remained constrained and haven't changed
for four billion years in their morphology,
neither have archaea.
So could it be that they are constrained
by the way that they generate their energy?
Well, I think that's probably the case.
John Maynard Smith was one of the great evolutionary biologists of the 20th century,
and he was at UCL for a period where I am,
so I think a lot of...
It's a great place, UCL, at least in one sense,
in the sense that some of the greatest thinkers and biologists of the 20th century
worked there for a while.
They all left and went to Cambridge or somewhere after a bit,
but for a while they were all there at UCL,
and I think a lot of us walk around these corridors and think,
oh, JVS Haldane used to walk down here.
I better do something good today.
So Maynard Smith was one of the great evolutionary biologists of the 20th century,
and he liked calling things that shouldn't happen
and evolutionary scandal.
He was scandalised by sex.
Sex really shouldn't happen.
Why wouldn't people not just make clones of themselves instead?
And he spent a lot of his career trying to work out why sex does happen
and why most things that make clones of themselves just fall extinct after a period.
I'd like to think, he never actually said that the eukaryotes were an evolutionary scandal,
but I think he would have seen it in those terms.
The problem is that all complex life is composed of this one cell type,
this eukaryotic cell.
The fact that we all obviously share a common ancestor
because the plants and the animals, if you look at their cells under a microscope,
they're almost indistinguishable in the sense that they all have a nucleus.
They all have lots of membrane systems called the endoplasmic reticulum, for example.
All lysosomes, they all have mitochondria.
You could write page after page in a textbook of things that plants and animals have in common
at the level of cells,
but fungi have the same things in common as well,
and so does an amoeba, or single-celled algae and so on.
It's a shockingly long list, and it's quite baffling as to why that would be the case.
So traits like sex as well, lots of amoeba, in fact pretty much all of them,
are sexual, it turns out.
For a long time we assumed they weren't because you never really caught two of them together.
But now we know their genomes.
Funnily enough, it's the genomes that give insight into these things.
We can see that all the genes that are required for meiosis,
which is to say the recombination part of sex and the cell division,
we find them all in amoeba.
We find them all in very ancient looking cells.
And there's plenty of evidence, again, from the genomes
that they've been recombining genes and changing the structure of the genome continuously.
We know that they're sexual, even if we've never caught them at it.
So this is the scandal then.
All eukaryotic cells share this long list of traits.
Bacteria and archaea just don't do it.
They don't do sex, for example.
They pass genes around a bit, they do some recombination,
but they don't fuse cells together, line up whole genomes,
cross across genes and then separate up, and bacteria just don't do that.
So the scandal, if all of these traits, and there's hundreds and hundreds of them,
evolve by natural selection, step by step,
and there's no reason to imagine that that didn't happen,
and each of these small steps offered some kind of an advantage,
and again, there's no reason to assume that that's not true,
then why is it that none of them evolve in the bacteria or the archaea for the same reasons?
They really ought to, but they don't.
So you could think of eyes as a nice example.
Lots of creationists say what use is half an eye,
but evolution is full of things that most people would say was half an eye.
And it's exactly as natural selection would predict.
There are at least 60 or 70 separate origins of morphologically complex eyes.
That's not quite true, as I'm putting it,
because a lot of them in animals share a common ancestor
on some kind of a worm that had a light sensitive spot.
But it's partly true in the sense that the octopus eye, for example,
was over here somewhere, and the human eye
have arrived with a camera eye essentially independently.
It's convergent evolution.
They started from a light sensitive spot,
and independently they ended up with a camera type eye.
There are one or two regulatory genes in common,
but they independently recruited all the rest of the genes.
But then there are, I think, this is Eudlina, an algorithm.
It's got an eye spot.
It's got the same proteins, light sensitive proteins,
rhodopsins in that eye spot that we have in our own eyes.
This is even more amazing.
This is a camera type eye, which you can see the lens,
you can see the retina, you can see a cornea.
That's in a single cell.
That's a single protist, eukaryotic protist.
The retina is composed of chloroplasts,
just reused for a different purpose.
The lens, I'm not sure what the lens is made of,
but the cornea is made of mitochondria.
Again, they've just been cobbled together
and used for a different purpose,
but it's a camera eye inside a single cell.
My point is this is what natural selection will predict,
that there should be multiple different types of eye
in different environments, different ecological contexts,
different types of eye with different functioning.
We don't see the evolutionary intermediates,
but we see ecologically all the different types.
We would expect to see something similar in bacteria.
We would expect to see some bacteria that have something
that's a bit like a nucleus,
or some that do something a bit like sex,
or that can do phagocytosis,
go around and engulf cells and eat them.
These are all valuable traits for us,
so why don't the bacteria do it?
It's not like the eye.
There's a big difference there in what we see around us.
It really boils down to this question that I raised earlier on.
What was happening down this branch of the tree of life
that wasn't happening over here,
and it's not to do with information
because these guys trawl through all the information
and still didn't come out with the answer.
I want to make the point that it's not at the level
of large plants and animals.
The real difference, the real void,
is at the level of single cells.
It's a bog standard alga,
the kind of thing you'd find in any pond in London
or anywhere else, euglina.
Over here is a relatively complex bacterium.
It's actually even got a little compartment inside it,
which some people have said is a bit like a nucleus.
It's not really.
The reason you can't see it well is it's roughly to scale.
You don't need to know what most of these things are in here
to realise that this is a lot bigger and more complicated.
These are the mitochondria.
This is actually a chloroplast.
You can see the nucleus there,
but it's on a different scale.
The level of complexity in a single cell
has gone out by orders of magnitude
compared to a relatively complex bacterium.
Not in the biochemistry,
but in this morphological complexity.
It's interesting that if you were to compare
two different eukaryotic cells,
they look rather similar.
This is paramecium, which is a single cell protist,
and this is a pancreatic asinase cell, a human one.
Again, they're roughly to the same scale,
and most people would look at them and say,
well, they're kind of similar.
In terms of the amount of complexity going on in them,
they're not a world apart.
This is a single cell protist,
and this is part of a multicellular organism.
It's out of curiosity.
Has anyone got any idea how many genes by genes,
protein coding genes, paramecium has?
Any thoughts?
Twice the amount of humans.
Exactly, twice the amount of humans.
40,000 genes.
Now maybe we do lots of additional regulation,
or maybe we're just not very much more complicated
than paramecium.
By most objective measures of complexity,
there's not a great world of difference
between these two types of cell,
in terms of the number of genes,
in terms of the amount of morphological complexity,
in terms of basically the hard wiring of it.
The real difference is between bacteria and single cell eukaryotes,
rather than between single cell eukaryotes
and large multicellular organisms.
I'm going to have to, rather than exploring all the possible options,
I'm going to tell you what I think the answer is.
We could be here all the rest of the week.
Here's a group of cells that are pretty simple,
as eukaryotes go.
This is jardia.
Jardia causes explosive diarrhea,
that anybody who's been walking in the mountains in America,
may have had jardial poisoning.
I never had it,
but when I used to go walking in the mountains in places like that,
I used to be terrified that when I drank from the mountain streams,
I would get it.
But it doesn't have any mitochondria,
and people thought it didn't do sex either until quite recently,
when it turns out it is sexual,
and it turns out that it does have mitochondria too,
just not as we know them.
It has organelles which derive from mitochondria,
called mitosomes.
It's typical of science as well.
It took 25 years of probably about
at least 15 research groups around the world,
not just with jardia,
but with these others as well,
microsperidia, trichomonas, entomebo, monocircumenoides.
These are cells that don't have mitochondria.
For a long time, they were thought to be
an evolutionary intermediate, a living fossil
from very early in eukaryotic evolution,
that were given insight into how complex cells evolved.
It turns out they're not.
They're all derived.
They all had far more complex ancestors in the past,
evolved down in complexity to become more like bacteria.
They all have mitochondria,
and it took 25 years of these research groups
around the world to nail that.
The reason it was done, in part,
is because half of them are parasites,
and so they're of medical interest.
As soon as things become of medical interest,
then people are going to fund you.
If people went to the funders and said,
these are really interesting living fossils
that might give us an insight into
the evolution of complexity,
they're not going to get funded, unfortunately.
If you say it causes explosive diarrhea,
where's the checkbook?
So that's what they said.
They said it causes explosive diarrhea,
and they had 20 years of funding,
and they spent it very wisely
on the early evolution of complexity.
We now know that these are actually
not living fossils, but highly derived.
The one thing that we can take away from it
is they all had mitochondria in the past,
and that's important.
It's important, in part,
because mitochondria, as I said at the beginning,
were bacteria once,
and this was made famous by Lynn Margulis.
Margulis, I should say.
She died of a stroke a couple of years ago.
I only met her once,
and I admired her enormously,
but she had a knack of disagreeing
with everybody about everything,
including me.
Yes, well, that man is...
She was married to Carl Sagan,
and they divorced after a while.
Before she wrote her famous paper in 1967,
they'd already divorced.
I'd love to have heard their breakfast conversations
between those two, but anyway,
she was the person who really nailed the idea
that mitochondria were bacteria once.
She nailed the idea that chloroplasts
derived from bacteria as well,
and she also argued for a long time
that there were lots of other symbioses,
for example, with spirochetes bacteria,
giving rise to the cytoskeleton
and the flagella and so on.
Nobody agrees with her about that.
She was very strong-willed
and disagreed with most people about most things,
but she was bang on for these central ideas
on the origin of the eukaryotic cell,
and the amount of, I suppose you call it,
hate mail now that she got.
If you read the literature from after her paper in 1967
through into the early 70s,
people did not like these ideas at all,
and they wrote really unpleasant diatribes
in the literature.
You can understand why she became very hardened to abuse
and eventually basically believed everybody else
was wrong apart from her.
She was asked once,
why does she enjoy being so controversial,
and her answer was,
I don't think I'm controversial, I think I'm right.
I'm not even sure she used the word think.
So that's Slim Margulis,
and she nailed that mitochondria derived from bacteria,
and we still can't really agree
about exactly which kind of bacteria were they,
but probably something like Rhodobacter that we're seeing there.
So something acquired these bacteria
that went on to become the mitochondria,
and again, there's been no agreement
about what kind of a cell that was until quite recently,
and this is a place called Loki's Castle,
which is just off the coast of Norway,
and a Swedish group have been trawling around
in the muds underneath there
and sequencing everything that they found in those muds.
So we've never even now seen
what these cells actually looked like.
This is what's called metagenomic reconstruction.
So you sequence everything,
and you try and piece together genomes
by effectively matching the ends up,
and eventually you put together the genome of these cells.
There's a certain amount of debate
about whether there's contamination in there,
but it looks broadly true,
and the thing that's really surprising about it is,
you carry it to here, this is another tree,
and right next to them,
so we started out with a Loki archaeata there,
we're discovered at Loki's Castle,
and since then various others have been found,
and they've kept going with this Norse theme,
so now we've got all the Norse gods down there,
we've got the Odin archaeata and the Thor archaeata
and the Heimdal archaeata and so on.
But the thing which is really plain
is that you carry it to our branching
right in the middle of those groups.
So whatever the host cell was that acquired mitochondria
was something pretty similar to this,
and the irony is we don't know what this looks like,
we don't know what kind of a cell it was.
Some people say it was a primitive phagasite
that kind of tried to eat things.
Other people, including me, say,
oh no, it wasn't, it was an autotrofe,
it used hydrogen gas.
I don't think we can really be very sure yet
what kind of a cell it was,
but it was probably basically a fairly simple cell.
And so this is another tree,
which I think is beautiful,
this is from one of the most, I think, brilliant biologists
operating today, a guy called Bill Martin.
He also has a knack of winding people up.
And this tree goes back to 1998.
And it's remarkable for several reasons.
One of them is that it's now more right than it was then.
So in 1998 when he put this forward,
I think most people must have thought he was bonkers.
Look down here, we have two separate origins
from a hydrothermal vent.
So the bacteria on the archaea.
I haven't really gone into the details of that.
When I first heard him say that in 2002,
I thought he was completely bonkers.
I now think he was absolutely right.
I haven't really had time to go into why they would,
so they share a common ancestor,
but down inside the vents.
The other thing which is really clear on here
is he has a kind of genomic merger going on.
So genes from the archaea and genes from the bacteria
are fusing together here to form the eukaryotes.
And this is a singular endosymbiosis.
This one is the chloroplasts.
So this is not really the same as Lynn Margulis
who had lots of these things going on
in all kinds of different cell lines.
This was a singular event that gave rise to eukaryotic cells.
And later on, the acquisition of chloroplasts
gave rise to plants, but it didn't change anything really
about the big structure of eukaryotic evolution.
Plants are the same type of cells that we have,
except with chloroplasts added in and a vacuol,
but we're basically the same.
So Bill has this singular origin of complex life.
Now a lot of people really hate this idea,
and I think it's in part because we don't really like the idea
of freak accidents in science.
It kind of almost puts itself beyond science.
We can't study statistically an accident, a singularity,
but you can think about it in a very productive way.
If this was the origin of the eukaryotic cell,
and it started something like this,
this is the only example that we know of
of bacteria living inside another bacterial cell.
So there's plenty of bacteria living inside
our own type of cell, eukaryotic cells,
but it's really rare for bacteria to be inside another bacterial cell.
This is not a phagocyte.
It didn't engulf the cell to get in there.
It's got a cell wall around it.
It's actually a cyanobacterium,
and you can see the photosynthetic membranes here.
So we don't know what they're doing there.
This actually is an old discovery.
This is from 1979,
when they were still called blue-green algae in those days.
And blue-green algae really refers to eukaryotes,
so everybody ignored that paper for 20 years
until it turned out they were actually bacteria
with bacteria inside,
and so this speaks more about the whole sweep of evolution.
Why would that make a difference?
Well, the cells that are living inside,
they are bacteria.
They are cells.
They've got their own agenda.
They want to grow.
They want to divide.
They want to...
There's a lovely quote from Jack Monogh,
who said that the dream of every cell is to become two cells.
And so that's what these guys are dreaming about in here.
They're thinking, how am I going to double?
And the way that they do it,
if you imagine a population of bacteria,
and they're all growing frantically,
and the speed at which they grow
depends on the speed at which they can copy their genome
as much as anything else.
And so the smaller the genome is, the faster they can grow.
It tells that if there's something about the environment
that means they don't need this gene now,
it's not useful and they lose it, they delete it,
then they can probably grow a little bit faster
because their genome is just a little bit smaller.
And over a couple of days, bacteria,
their growth rate does depend on that kind of factor.
But then the environment changes again
and whatever it was that that gene did,
you need it again now.
And so they pick it up.
What bacteria do is they pick up genes
called lateral gene transfer.
It's like passing loose change around.
They acquire it again
and before you know it, you're back where you were.
But if you've got a same population of bacteria
living inside another cell,
they do the same thing.
They throw away genes that they don't need.
Imagine that those genes are for making a cell wall,
and you're living inside another cell,
and you don't need a cell wall for protection inside another cell
or for preventing yourself exploding
with the difference in pressure between the outside and inside.
So you lose those genes, you grow a little bit faster,
you come to dominate the population.
But so long as the cell doesn't die that you're living in,
you'll be all right.
You never need those genes again.
And so there's a tendency for bacterial parasites
to lose genes and to become simpler.
And not just bacterial parasites,
we see the same thing with Jardier and so on.
And a very nice example is Rickettsia,
which a few years ago people thought
was very closely related to mitochondria.
It's probably not so closely related.
But it's still a beautiful example.
It was the cause of time that wiped out the armies of Napoleon
on his retreat from Moscow.
And it's spread by these ticks.
And it's a bacterium.
Here it is invading a large eukaryotic cell.
I think it's actually a kidney cell.
And the one thing about it which stands out
is it's got a tiny genome.
It's around about one megabase genome.
And that's true for all of these things.
I'm not just hand-waving here.
This is the range of genome sizes of free-living bacteria.
It goes up to around about 12 megabases now.
This guy, T. Ryan Gregory, did a lot of work on genome sizes.
And down at this other end,
these are the parasites and the endosymbionts
and the obligate symbionts.
They're pretty much down at less than one megabase of DNA.
So just for comparison's sake,
we have 3,000 megabases of DNA.
The largest bacterial genome is 12 megabases of DNA.
And some large algae, like eudlina,
are up to 100,000 megabases of DNA.
So we have quite constrained genomes
in comparison with some single cell.
The largest one is a thing called Amoeba W,
which was miscountered.
It was originally 670,000 megabases.
It's come down to 150,000 last count.
But still, it's very, very substantially bigger
than our own genome.
But what happens with these bacteria that live in other cells?
They lose genes. They become simpler.
They whittle away.
And that's what ended up with the mitochondria.
All these mitochondria that we have
in millions of billions of copies,
they all have genomes of their own,
and they're passed on down the maternal line
from mother to son.
My kids don't have my mitochondria.
They have my wife's mitochondria.
It's a very strange arrangement that I won't go into now.
What it means is that if you want to be bigger,
more complex and spend more energy,
it's not just a case of having a larger surface area.
You've got a whole unit here.
That unit has some genes, which in some way control respiration.
It's got the protein building factories, the ribosomes.
It's a unit, and if you want to expand,
you just make more units.
You have more mitochondria.
But it's not just that you're increasing the surface area.
You've got genomes with each one.
And that allows you to expand up on a massive scale.
And the person who's, I think, done more on this side,
again, going back to the early 1990s,
John Allen has been arguing that they require genes
to control respiration.
And still, I would say,
the majority of the field is not persuaded that he's correct.
He is correct, I'm sure of that.
But it takes an awful long time in science
for sometimes the simplest ideas to catch on.
Most people just don't really care very much, I'm afraid.
But it's the difference.
That they can, to become a very large cell,
you just scale up mitochondria.
So this is a giant bacterium, and there are a few around.
These little white dots here are the copies of the complete genome.
So the giant bacteria that do exist,
it seems that they also need genes to control respiration.
And this is the edge of the cell,
and this is the plasma membrane where respiration is taking place.
And they have as many as 200,000 copies of the complete genome.
And each genome is a normal-sized bacterial genome
with three megabases of DNA in it.
And this is a eukaryotic cell.
The blue is the nucleus where it's the main gene depot.
And all these little, the green spots here
are the mitochondrial DNA.
So there are hundreds or thousands of copies of mitochondrial DNA.
So the difference between these two cells
is not that this cell has an awful lot more DNA than that cell,
they actually have a similar amount.
It's that in that case it's got a kind of genomic symmetry.
There's thousands of copies of the same genome,
exactly the same genome.
Whereas here we've got one massive nuclear genome
which is supported energetically by this kind of end point.
Thousands of mitochondrial genomes which have whittled down
and become smaller and smaller and more and more streamlined.
So all the mitochondria, effectively,
it gives us multi-bacterial power without the bacterial overheads.
And that's what allows all those overheads
can go into supporting a massive nucleus with full of genes.
At least it's the raw material for natural selection to operate on.
And so we have a kind of genomic asymmetry.
And to me that's the real difference between bacteria
and large complex cells.
We've got two genomes.
There isn't such a thing as the human genome,
there are human genomes, the mitochondrial genome
and the nuclear genome.
This is the last slide.
Why then is complex life so rare?
Why did it only happen once on Earth?
And would it only happen rarely elsewhere in the universe?
There's a double bottleneck here.
One of them we have to get bacterium into another bacterial type cell
to break down this issue with membranes and scaling.
So you've got to have cells within cells to be able to scale up.
But those cells have their own agenda.
You have what's called conflict, levels of selection conflict
that the bacteria inside want to grow fast
and perhaps make their host cell fuse with other cells
or whatever they want to do.
The host cell itself wants to keep them under control
and bleed off the energy
but they don't want them replicating at any old speed.
Chances of it going wrong is really high.
And maybe this is why we don't see any surviving intermediates.
Maybe they all died because it was a pretty dodgy situation
for a long period of time or even a short period of time.
It's just that this is a long evolutionary distance.
Regardless of whether what I'm telling you is right or not,
this long evolutionary distance,
there are no evolutionary intermediates that have ever been found.
And so all of this complexity in this type of cell
and I would like to leave you with this thought,
we have no idea yet at least the difference between ideas
and serious scientific knowledge
where we can say that there have been experiments done and real data,
how any of this complexity of eukaryotic cells arose.
And if we want to understand medicine and what goes wrong in our own bodies
and we don't understand why these parts arose in the first place,
what were the evolutionary driving forces that made them evolve,
how can we really understand ourselves and medicine?
And if this starts out with mitochondria in a very simple cell
with none of that complexity,
the nice thing from my point of view is that perhaps all of this complexity arose
and the reason that we share such similar cells with plants and with algae
is not that we were all adapting to different external environments,
but we all were adapting to the same internal environment,
the problem of having cells living inside us.
And it's that that drove all of this complexity.
And once it became a stable system,
then eukaryotes could spread out and take over the rest of the world.
And with that, I'd like to say thank you very much.
This work has been done by many people,
and it's great fun having a lab with so many bright young people coming through it.
It's an inspiration for me. Thank you very much.
