0	7000	Welcome, everybody, to the last Garrad seminar here in Cambridge of the McLemors term.
7000	10000	Thank you for attending.
10000	29000	And just looking forward, continue pleased to watch this space because we have a very full programming built for our Garrads for January to March, where the theme will be decolonization, and we'll have a series of exciting speakers and panels and such like to which to look forward.
30000	38000	Those of you who are members of staff here in the department will know that our departmental meeting ended about one to two minutes ago.
38000	48000	Can't very wisely parachute it out about 10 minutes to get to get us off ready. I was unable to because I was chairing it. And that means that the vital 10 minutes produced a usual flowery
48000	62000	Incomium on the speaker that I would expect to produce didn't quite happen. So my, my apologies for that. And I hope whatever this introduction laps in flouriness will be made up for in terms of sincerity.
62000	78000	As you all know, one of the most exciting things about this department over the last few years has been the ability to appoint a series of outstanding new generation appointments in many fields, but particularly focusing in biological anthropology and in human evolution.
78000	90000	And if a previous speech we've heard two of those speakers present on their work. And today we have one further star appointment in the form of catcoops.
91000	96000	Who will be speaking us today on her research.
96000	109000	What I would like to just emphasize is cat is another of these globetrotting international stars she began in Utrecht came to Cambridge to do her doctoral work.
109000	123000	She then took up a position, a research position in Zurich, and we were again fortunate, very grateful to be able to entice the back to our advertised you to ship in primatology here at Cambridge.
123000	131000	The subject she's offering us is of apes and tools insights into the evolution of technology.
131000	138000	A marvelous subject about which we look forward to hearing from you can't over to you and thank you.
138000	149000	Thank you very much, Cyprian, and happy Thanksgiving to all. It's my great pleasure to be speaking to you today in the Department of archaeology is Garrett seminar series.
149000	162000	And I'm going to take this opportunity to talk about my research of apes and tools. And I hope to convince you that by studying a to use, we can in turn shed light on the evolution of technology.
162000	166000	First, I will talk about my research on chimpanzees.
166000	172000	Then we will dive into my comparative work on chimpanzees and bonobos.
172000	181000	And lastly, I will introduce you to ongoing and upcoming research across all the African apes and humans.
181000	184000	But first, how did it all begin?
184000	193000	The oldest known hominid stone tool dates to about 3.3 million years ago and was found in Western Canada and Kenya.
193000	205000	Over millions of years, technology evolves from these simple stone tools to more elaborate by faces, spear points, bows and arrows, needles and pottery.
205000	213000	That's the way to the complex technology we have today, which includes things like spaceships.
213000	220000	Across the globe, we see an amazing spectrum of cultural diversity with different people using different technologies.
220000	231000	And these technologies have helped humans spread all over the world into places ranging from the Arctic to the desert to the rainforest.
231000	234000	This is a defining feature of our species.
234000	238000	Humans are the only species dependent on technology for their survival.
238000	248000	And the question what makes humans such unique technological beings is akin to asking the fundamental question what makes us human.
248000	255000	My central research question therefore is what drives the evolution of technology.
255000	266000	Unfortunately, we don't have a time machine to study the use of tools by our hominin ancestors, but we do have the next best thing, our closest living relatives, the great apes.
266000	280000	So workplaces are silent, studies of living apes are essential for understanding how and why hominin behavior changed since our lineage split from that of the other apes.
280000	290000	The African apes are genetically most closely related to us, and chimpanzees and bonobos are our closest living relatives.
290000	297000	So by studying them, we can discover what distinguishes humanity from its ape-like ancestors.
297000	309000	Chimpanzees are especially informative with regards to the evolution of technology, since they use a wide variety of tools across a range of contexts, just like we do.
309000	314000	For example, some chimpanzee groups crack nuts.
314000	324000	Here you see Zhezhe, an adult male, and he's using a stone, hammer, and an ember to crack open oil palm nuts.
324000	328000	Other chimpanzee groups dip for army ants.
328000	341000	Here we see Guy, an adult female, and she's using a long stick to harvest these aggressive ants from their underground nest.
341000	348000	So what we see is that different chimpanzee groups, called communities, use different types of tools.
348000	353000	And interestingly, some groups use more tool types than others.
353000	358000	These differences in two-use behaviors were found to be cultural.
358000	368000	We, primatologists, termed behavioral variants cultural if they are true typical and depend on social learning for their transmission.
368000	377000	Now a lot of research went into figuring out whether chimpanzees and other non-human species indeed do have culture.
377000	387000	First, by showing that behavioral variation across populations cannot simply be chalked up to environmental or genetic differences between sites.
387000	401000	And second, by using experimental research and captivity to confirm that social learning processes are indeed involved in the acquisition of tool use.
402000	405000	Now how about tool use in the other primates?
405000	418000	As we saw, humans are the ultimate tool using ape, and among the non-human apes, diverse tool use is found in wild chimpanzees and to a lesser extent in orangutans.
418000	429000	In wild gorillas, evidence for tool use is almost absent and restricted to just a few anecdotes of stick use for postural support.
429000	434000	Similarly, tool use in wild bonobos is rare and absent in food acquisition.
434000	441000	However, bonobos are capable of making and using tools in captivity.
441000	452000	More recently, tool use has been reported in two species of monkeys, bearded capuchin monkeys and long-tailed macaques.
452000	460000	Now the big question, of course, is what explains these differences in primate tool use?
460000	473000	The original model of primate tool use suggested that cognition, which includes learning and insight, influences the invention and transmission of tool use.
473000	482000	Sociality, which includes porous and gregariousness, was further proposed to influence tool use, transmission and retention.
482000	488000	But there's no mention of the potential influence of the environment.
488000	493000	Hence, I set out to build this gap and address exactly this.
493000	498000	How does the environment influence tool use and does culture?
498000	509000	And further, how do the environment's sociality and cognition work together to drive primate tool use and material culture?
509000	513000	So this brings us to the roadmap of my talk.
513000	522000	To shed light on the big question, what drives the evolution of technology, I study apes across Africa.
522000	532000	First, I will talk about my work on the role of the environment in driving tool use at my study site in the NIMBA mountains in Guinea, West Africa.
532000	541000	And I will also introduce you to some other exciting non-tool use related research projects at NIMBA.
541000	549000	Then second, I will talk about my comparative research on chimpanzees and bonobos, our two closest living relatives.
549000	556000	At which the chimpanzee uses a range of origin tools, and the other, the bonobo doesn't.
556000	567000	So just dramatic difference in use of technology makes the species comparison ideal for examining the roles of the environment's sociality and cognition.
567000	577000	And then lastly, I will introduce you to my current research, which includes all the African apes as well as humans, all living in the Congo basin forest.
577000	588000	So this will be the roadmap for my talk today and it will appear throughout to help you stay on track as we move through the different sections.
588000	593000	So let's start off with the research on chimpanzee technology in West Africa.
593000	601000	I will first introduce you to my chimpanzee study site in the NIMBA mountains in Guinea.
601000	615000	It's the only montane chimpanzee study site in West Africa, and this extreme environment makes it an ideal place to study tool use diversity in this highly flexible and adaptable species.
615000	622000	I first started studying the NIMBA chimpanzees in 2003, so that's over 17 years ago now.
622000	625000	And this is what the NIMBA team looked like in the early days.
625000	629000	And this is what the team looked like a decade later.
629000	642000	And certainly our Canadian collaborators are continuing to monitor the chimpanzees and other wildlife whilst taking all the necessary COVID safety precautions.
642000	646000	And these are some of the chimpanzees.
646000	650000	Our research focuses on two communities at the study site.
650000	654000	And at NIMBA, we use three ways of collecting data.
654000	660000	We conduct behavioral observations of the chimpanzees when possible.
660000	671000	These chimpanzees are only partly habituated to the presence of researchers, so we cannot rely exclusively on direct observations for our data collection.
671000	679000	We also use motion triggered camera traps, which is a great way of obtaining data without researchers being present.
679000	688000	For instance, we study indirect evidence, such as the tools the chimpanzees leave behind.
688000	697000	Now, before we dive into the tool use findings from NIMBA, I would like to highlight some exciting recent and ongoing research projects.
697000	705000	Firstly, I will introduce you to the first ever findings of trap fishing by chimpanzees.
705000	710000	We will have a look at exciting new work on buttress drumming.
710000	720000	And, thirdly, I will tell you about work on chimpanzee sociality and grouping patterns at NIMBA.
720000	722000	First, trap fishing.
722000	726000	We discovered that NIMBA chimpanzees eat freshwater traps.
726000	734000	This is the first record of a non human aid consuming traps and the first evidence of chimpanzees eating aquatic fauna.
734000	744000	And as you can see here, the chimpanzees search for crabs in these shallow water courses by using their fingers to disturb the stream bed.
744000	748000	Trap fishing is often a group activity.
748000	754000	Here we see an adult female on the right who is busy fishing for crabs.
754000	764000	Whilst her kiddo up on the tree there is having a great time playing around.
764000	767000	So what did we find?
767000	776000	The chimpanzees fished for crabs year round and this was not related to the availability of fruit.
776000	784000	Interestingly, trap fishing is done most and for the longest durations by females and their offspring.
784000	794000	And nutritional analysis show that crabs are high in salt and calcium and maybe an important source of these micronutrients.
794000	803000	Now these findings on trap fishing in chimpanzees, they can contribute to our understanding of aquatic carnivory in hominence.
803000	812000	First, our findings suggest that consumption of aquatic fauna can occur in closed forests in addition to open wetlands.
812000	820000	Second, aquatic fauna could have been a staple part of hominin diets rather than a seasonal fallback fruit.
820000	829000	And third, consumption of aquatic fauna could have been especially important for females and their immature offspring.
829000	842000	Now at NIMBA we are currently very interested in looking at how young chimpanzees learn to eat crabs and why not all communities in NIMBA fish for crabs.
842000	850000	So let's now have a look at buttress drumming.
850000	858000	This was an adult male in NIMBA drumming on this huge buttress tree.
858000	875000	This is researched by my PhD student Megan Fitzgerald and she is interested in finding out whether chimpanzees are selective as to which trees and which buttresses they drum on in order to shed light on the function of buttress drumming.
875000	885000	By comparing trees used for drumming with unused trees, she found that yes chimpanzees convert certain tree species.
885000	890000	They prefer bigger trees and trees with more buttresses.
890000	900000	And secondly, yes chimpanzees prefer buttresses that are thinner and have a larger surface area.
900000	908000	So these findings show very clear selectivity in both buttress drumming tree choice and in buttress choice.
908000	921000	The difference for these more resident substrates so the larger and thinner buttresses supports the proposed function of drumming in long distance communication.
921000	924000	Next chimpanzee sociology.
924000	929000	Here we see a chimpanzee traveling party or a subgroup.
929000	942000	chimpanzees live in efficient fusion society where community members form these temporary parties that frequently change in size and positions.
942000	948000	Here we have a number of adult females with their offspring.
948000	962000	The motion trigger cameras give us a really unique look into the lives of these wild chimpanzees.
962000	972000	My then master student Kelly von Leuen was interested in finding out the best methods to measure chimpanzee party size.
972000	977000	So she set out to compare three different measures.
977000	980000	Direct observations.
980000	989000	Nest count. So these are the bets that chimpanzees made to sleep in at night and motion trigger cameras.
989000	1005000	And what Kelly found was that motion trigger cameras best represented chimpanzee party size and most accurately reflected the effects of social ecological factors such as food abundance and the presence of extras females.
1005000	1013000	Motion trigger cameras show that the more food and the more extras females there are, the bigger the parties.
1013000	1022000	So these findings really highlight the exciting potential of using these motion trigger cameras to study unhabituated chimpanzees.
1022000	1029000	And you could say that this new technology is a game changer.
1029000	1036000	Okay, after this middle excursion, we will now get back to today's seminar topic, which is to use.
1036000	1041000	Now, what types of tools do we find in NIMBA?
1041000	1047000	A few years ago now we discovered a new type of tool used both triculia fracturing.
1047000	1060000	Triculia fracturing is a form of percussive technology, and it involves the use of stone and wooden cleavers to open up the large and fibrous fruits of triculia apricana.
1060000	1068000	Here you see the stone cleaver and the fractured fruit on the right.
1068000	1072000	The second type of tool used in NIMBA is endoping.
1072000	1080000	We also found that the chimpanzees were selective regarding the species of plants they used to make tools.
1080000	1090000	We also found that they use two different types of endipping tools, a tool set consisting of an endipping and a digging tool.
1090000	1096000	And here you see the two types of tools left behind in an end nest.
1096000	1102000	Here chimpanzees in NIMBA do not crack nuts nor do they fish with termites.
1102000	1114000	And the absence of nut cracking is especially surprising since the close by chimpanzees in BOSU are highly dependent on nut cracking for subsistence.
1114000	1124000	Now remember my main research question in NIMBA with regards to technology was how does the environment influence tools?
1124000	1135000	To assess whether and how the environment influences tool use in chimpanzees, I tested two non-mutually exclusive hypotheses.
1135000	1150000	The opportunity hypothesis states that encounter rates with resources may determine the use of forging tools, whereas the necessity hypothesis states that forging tool use is a response to the scarcity of preferred foods,
1150000	1156000	which in the case of chimpanzees is ripe fruit.
1156000	1164000	To test the opportunity hypothesis, I assessed the opportunities for chimpanzees to encounter food sources requiring tool use.
1164000	1168000	Here we have a very schematic version of the study site.
1168000	1176000	And what I found was that, first of all, chimpanzees preferred to range at high altitudes.
1176000	1183000	Secondly, nut trees and termites were rare and were found mainly at low altitudes.
1183000	1192000	And thirdly, Armenians were abundant and occurred mainly at high altitudes just like the chimpanzees.
1192000	1204000	Hence the presence of endipping and the absence of termite fishing and nut cracking could be explained by the opportunities to encounter these resources.
1204000	1216000	To test the necessity hypothesis, I looked at the relationship between tool use in endipping and the availability of ripe fruit, the chimpanzees preferred food.
1216000	1227000	And here we see fruit availability on the x-axis and the proportion of species with ends as a proxy for endipping on the y-axis.
1227000	1235000	And as you can see, there is no correlation between fruit availability and end consumption.
1235000	1250000	So to sum up, tool use at NIMBA could indeed be explained by the opportunities to encounter specific food sources, whereas low fruit availability did not lead to more tool use.
1250000	1260000	So these findings suggest that ecological opportunity rather than necessity may be the mother of invention.
1260000	1278000	In fact, findings on three species of tool using primates, chimpanzees, capuchins, and orangutans show that the ecological opportunities to encounter resources requiring tool use are key in explaining tool use patterns.
1278000	1287000	And since we can revise the original model, how we can add an explicit role for the environment.
1287000	1297000	Next, I developed a research design to determine the relative importance of these three factors.
1297000	1310000	The second part of my talk will now have a look at my comparative research on chimpanzees and monobos to look at the roles of the environment's sociality and cognition.
1310000	1321000	For this, I studied chimpanzees at Kalinzu in Uganda and bonobos at Wamba in the Democratic Republic of Hong Kong.
1321000	1329000	Chimpanzees and monobos are equally closely related to us, yet they differ drastically in their use of technology.
1329000	1339000	Chimpanzees are renowned for their extensive use of forging tools, whereas monobos use few tools in the wild and none in forging.
1339000	1350000	Now to investigate what explained this tool use difference, I examined the roles of ecological, social, and cognitive factors.
1350000	1362000	First, I measured the ecological opportunities in terms of insects and not availability for both chimpanzees at Kalinzu and bonobos at Wamba.
1362000	1375000	To illustrate the findings for the bonobos, here we have the bonobo follows at Wamba for the two communities that I studied, and the yellow dots indicate army and encounters.
1375000	1382000	And you can see that army ends occur across the bonobo ranges.
1382000	1392000	Similarly, macrotermies, termite mounds, the green dots, were found across the two home ranges.
1392000	1402000	Hence ecological opportunities in terms of insects and not availability could not explain the difference in tools between chimpanzees and monobos.
1402000	1409000	Bonobos really had plentiful opportunities to use tools.
1409000	1419000	Second, I looked at the social opportunities in terms of the number of social partners and feeding proximity to others.
1419000	1427000	First, the number of social partners gives an indication of the number of possible models to learn from.
1427000	1436000	Here we have chimpanzees in blue and bonobos in red, and the mean number of social partners on the y-axis.
1436000	1446000	And what we see is that young bonobos have more social partners than young chimpanzees from whom to potentially learn.
1446000	1457000	Next, feeding in close proximity to others provides a more direct way to assess learning opportunities in the relevant context of feeding.
1457000	1463000	Here we have the proportion of time feeding in close proximity on the y-axis.
1463000	1475000	And what we see is that young bonobos spend more time feeding close to others than young chimpanzees, and they therefore have more opportunities to learn feeding skills from others.
1475000	1485000	So what we would predict based on social opportunities is that bonobos would use more tools than chimpanzees, but they don't.
1485000	1494000	Hence, social opportunities could not explain the species' differences in tools.
1494000	1506000	Third, we assess a potential difference in the predisposition for tools by comparing object manipulation in young chimpanzees and bonobos.
1506000	1522000	Object manipulation changes from non-gold-directed exploration of sticks or leaves into gold-directed tools such as hand-dipping or leaf-spoinging, as chimpanzees mature.
1522000	1529000	So object manipulation can be considered the developmental precursor of tool use.
1529000	1532000	Now what does this look like?
1532000	1537000	Here you see an example of chimpanzee object manipulation.
1537000	1547000	This is a seven-year-old female chimpanzee named Piku, and she is making a probing tool to investigate a hole in a dead tree.
1547000	1561000	Some of the object manipulation by imitators is actual tool use, but most of it involves behaviors like exploring, parrying, breaking, or playing with objects.
1561000	1566000	Here we have another example of chimpanzee object manipulation.
1566000	1577000	This is Aiu, a three-year-old female behind there, and Mugisha, a one-year-old male, and they're playing together with a leaf.
1577000	1585000	And we call this social object play.
1585000	1590000	And here we have an example of bonobo object manipulation.
1590000	1598000	This is a one-and-a-half-year-old bonobo called Siko, and he is having a wonderful time playing with a twig.
1598000	1604000	And we call this solitary object play.
1604000	1607000	So what did I find?
1607000	1620000	Here we see object manipulation rates on the y-axis at different ages on the x-axis in the two species, chimpanzees in blue and bonobos in red.
1620000	1629000	And what we see is, as predicted, higher rates of object manipulation in chimpanzees as compared to bonobos.
1629000	1642000	Okay, this difference is already clear at a very young age, suggesting an innate predisposition rather than a learned interest in objects.
1642000	1654000	Hence the predisposition to interact with objects did play an important role in explaining the species difference and tool use.
1654000	1657000	So to summarize what we have seen so far.
1657000	1668000	We saw that ecological opportunities are important in explaining differences across populations of a tool using species like the chimpanzee.
1668000	1680000	And second, we saw that an intrinsic predisposition for tool use was important in explaining why some species use tools and others don't.
1680000	1685000	But there's of course one key species missing from these comparisons.
1685000	1688000	How do we humans fit in?
1688000	1701000	And what are the roles of environmental, social and cognitive factors in explaining the difference in technology between humans and the other apes?
1701000	1714000	This brings us to the final part of my talk, where I will introduce you to our upcoming projects, which includes all the African apes and humans.
1714000	1724000	The comparative human and ape technology or chat project with Kopei's Cricket Sons and Dave Morgan is the first comparative study of tool use.
1724000	1728000	They include all the African apes as well as humans.
1728000	1737000	And second, the chat project is the first to compare the African apes and humans whilst keeping the environmental context as good as constant.
1737000	1744000	All species reside in the Congo basin forest.
1744000	1757000	By including all the African apes and humans in the same comparative framework, we aim to shed light on the mechanisms that underlie human technology and set it apart from other species.
1757000	1768000	The diversity of tool using skills across the African plate provides a natural opportunity to implement a comparative approach to investigate how technology evolved.
1768000	1782000	Chimpanzees use a variety of tools across context, bonobos use few tools and non-enforging, and gorillas are generally considered non-tool users.
1782000	1791000	In addition, we'll take a developmental perspective to investigate the differences in tools between humans and African apes.
1791000	1804000	We will compare tool use developments across humans and apes and link ontogenetic trajectories to ecological and social developmental inputs.
1804000	1822000	The chat project includes chimpanzees, gorillas and benjala by Yaka hunter-gatherers in the Republic of Congo, and bonobos in neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo, all within the Congo basin forest.
1822000	1827000	The chat project uses a comparative approach.
1827000	1839000	First, comparative research in a natural ecological and social setting is crucial for determining the factors which brought differences in technology to emerge among humans and apes.
1839000	1853000	And second, including both apes and humans in the same comparative framework is essential to investigate to what extent apes and humans share traits that underlie tool use.
1853000	1860000	The chat project combines a comparative with a developmental approach.
1860000	1872000	First, ontogenetic stages are often given less attention than adult forms, even though small changes in developmental trajectories can have huge effects on adult phenotypes.
1872000	1880000	As surprisingly studies comparing tool use developments in humans and apes are virtually non-existent.
1880000	1891000	Second, developmental research often compares individuals across age classes rather than following an individual's development over time.
1891000	1903000	Such individual level longitudinal studies are needed to link ontogenetic trajectories to the ecological and social developmental inputs.
1903000	1915000	And third, three-factor model again. In the chat project we all built on previous research by investigating the roles of the environment, sociality and cognition.
1915000	1926000	And in addition, we'll now add the ontogenetic background on which the development of tool use takes place.
1926000	1936000	Now, moving up, I'll give you a glimpse of some of the first findings coming in from our Borrella pilot study looking at object manipulation.
1936000	1942000	Now we had no idea whether these non-tool using apes would do anything with objects at all.
1942000	1955000	So we were very excited to find that in fact young Borrelas do all sorts of things with objects. They explore them, they carry them, they throw them, they break them, they bite them, and they also play with them.
1955000	1963000	And most interestingly, they even seem to use them as what you might call tools.
1963000	1972000	Let's have a look. Here we see Kau, a young Borrella who is keen to play with the silverback called Loya on the left.
1972000	1980000	And as you can see, Kau uses a leapy twig to invite the silverback to play with him, and successfully so.
1980000	1986000	So depending on your definition, this could qualify as social tool use.
1986000	1999000	Now, of course, these are still preliminary observations and the next steps will involve collecting more data and comparing the patterns of object manipulation across species.
1999000	2010000	So to sum up, the chat project uses a comparative developmental approach to examine the evolution of tool use across the African apes and humans.
2010000	2019000	This approach is integrated with the explicit testing of both ecological and social cognitive hypotheses.
2019000	2035000	The ecological hypotheses include the necessity and opportunity hypotheses about which you heard a lot earlier, as well as the relative profitability hypotheses, which looks at the energetic tool use.
2035000	2046000	Then the social cognitive hypotheses include the exploratory tendency hypothesis. Remember the chimpanobo difference in object manipulation.
2046000	2060000	The social learning hypotheses, which looks at the role of learning mechanisms, and the cultural intelligence hypotheses, which considers social learning opportunities.
2060000	2070000	So ecological and social cognitive drivers likely both played a role in the evolution of technology in primates.
2070000	2088000	However, past research research has not assessed ecological and social cognitive factors for tool use in the same study, rarely considering more than a single primate species and often excluding humans from these comparisons, based on the assumption that comparable data could not be generated.
2089000	2107000	So we propose the comparative sociological and developmental approach or CSDA to identify the specific factors that have influenced the evolution of tool use, not only in apes, but across primate species, and including humans.
2108000	2120000	Such an integrated framework is crucial to understanding the processes shaping variation in technology across species, both during development and across evolutionary time.
2120000	2132000	This integrated approach can help advance our understanding of the adaptive qualities of tool use, as well as the selective pressures associated with the evolution of primate tools.
2132000	2149000	And understanding tool use as an adaptation is essential for identifying factors which are prompted to use across a range of primates and promote the flourishing of technology in our own lineage.
2150000	2171000	So before finishing, I would like to thank many people in many places, students and research assistants for their invaluable help in the field, many collaborators and colleagues for their support, and a list of funding bodies for their financial contributions.
2171000	2185000	And I'd like to thank you very much for listening and for your attention.
2185000	2194000	Thank you, Cat. Amazing talk, citing broad-ranging, ambitious, beautifully illustrated, and enormous amounts of food for thought.
2194000	2206000	Can I invite some questions either through the chat, preferably, or through frantic waving, if nothing else seems to be working? Laurie and I will be keeping a close eye on the chat.
2206000	2213000	Anyone like to open up?
2213000	2218000	Emily, straight in.
2218000	2222000	Yes, thank you, Cat. My presentation was great.
2222000	2229000	So I was wondering, because apparently there are some, well, there is one archaeological site for chimpanzees in Côte d'Ivoire.
2229000	2242000	I'm wondering if you could kind of compare the two views that in modern chimpanzees and tools from that archaeological site, and if you could see any differences or any kind of evolutionary patterns?
2242000	2250000	Yeah, yeah, this is really, this is a great site in Thai forest in Ivory Coast, where the chimpanzees today still crack nuts.
2250000	2258000	And what we're seeing is that, so these tools that they dug up, they were about 4,000 years old, I think.
2258000	2270000	And as far as I know, they look really quite similar to what we see today. So seemingly not all that much has changed over this time.
2270000	2286000	I don't know if there are more analyses really looking at more specific characteristics of these tools, but I think on the first glance, it looks very much like a nutcracker inside from the chimpanzees as we see today.
2286000	2288000	Thank you.
2288000	2292000	Rob, I think you have a question lined up and ready.
2292000	2307000	Yes. Thank you, Kat. That's absolutely fascinating. And the bit that always fascinates me is obviously the bonobo antrobloditis contrast, which is so striking for two such similar species.
2307000	2321000	I think your data, I mean that you could make a case that there's some sort of trade off going on between practical competence, we call it that technology and social intelligence and I just wondered,
2321000	2332000	why should that, I mean, do you think that's that is the right hypothesis and if so, I mean why should that be the case because it's not necessary unless we go down the kind of systematizing
2332000	2340000	the IQ type of models of Simon Baron Cohen, which are unlikely to apply to chimpanzees.
2340000	2348000	So I think there might indeed be some kind of trade off. But, and that's what I want to look more into with that exploratory tendency hypothesis.
2348000	2363000	I think that is more an interest or motivational trade off because also if we look at eye tracking studies of chimpanzees and bonobos we see that bonobos are very much paying attention to the eyes social social they're really interested in what somebody's doing,
2363000	2375000	whereas chimpanzee is paying much more attention to the object involved into whatever that individuals doing. So there seems to be a difference in interest which also comes across in my data on object manipulation.
2375000	2385000	So I don't think bonobos indeed are cognitively limited and are not able to, but they might simply be more interested in the social stuff.
2385000	2401000	So we're now planning planning a very cool project in a century bonobo century where the bonobos use tools they crack nuts that do all sorts of things. And we want to look at trying to tease apart these different explanations because
2401000	2411000	we have more controlled setting where we can look at interest in objects versus social stuff versus opportunities from learning from others.
2411000	2421000	So yeah trade off I think maybe more about motivation and interest than really about cognition as such or cognitive capacity.
2421000	2425000	Okay, thanks.
2425000	2432000	I have a question from John typed up here but it'll come much better if you deliver it in an only inimitable way. Over to you, John.
2432000	2438000	Oh, thanks cat brilliant talk wonderful. Just what you need in late November.
2438000	2440000	Quick question.
2440000	2449000	You were saying that you think chimps use tools and bonobos don't because baby chimps play with things and baby bonobos don't.
2449000	2459000	But is it, could it be the other way around then baby chimps play with things because when grown up they will need to use tools.
2459000	2461000	How do you figure out the causation.
2461000	2471000	Yeah, very tricky and very good question of course. So I think if you look at an evolutionary skill maybe at some point in time.
2471000	2484000	There might have been a situation where chimpanzees moved out of their forest and habitat at least some at some places whereas the bonobos always stayed in in this Congo basin rainforest.
2484000	2495000	So it might be that at that point there was selection for those individuals that could use tools, perhaps adapted better to certain changing environments.
2495000	2505000	So there might be some kind of Baldwin effects and kind of gene culture co evolution that if you are better if you are more interested in objects and do more object manipulation.
2505000	2516000	You might be better at learning how to use tools, and you might survive better etc so then this kind of object manipulation tendency or motivation gets locked in.
2516000	2528000	It's really like chicken and egg like where how, how, how what when, but that would be my, my best guess.
2528000	2534000	Other questions.
2535000	2542000	You dangled right at the end this very tantalizing possibility with the gorillas.
2542000	2557000	Could you invite you to expand on that and could did understand the right that you were suggesting that basically, if we altered the way we define activities, we might be categorizing different species propensity to other differently, or where was that going.
2558000	2567000	First of all, we didn't know at all what we were going to find with the gorilla so we're very excited to see that they are doing some things with objects.
2567000	2586000	Under some definitions of tool use this inviting somebody else to play with a tool or with an object would be categorized as tool use on their other definitions it wouldn't need wouldn't be, but I think what it indicates is that there's really interesting potential in other species perhaps they use tools
2586000	2596000	that are in a social context and less for feeding and kind of comes back to what we talked about with Rob this different interest and different motivations.
2596000	2612000	So this is super preliminary data that we're just starting to look at. So I cannot say all that much more, but just to say that they are doing some things with objects and yeah there might actually be something interesting there.
2612000	2617000	I have a question from David you which I think he would like to deliver himself.
2617000	2620000	Hi, thank you very much.
2620000	2634000	Interesting. I just want to ask, is there any possible. Was there any evidence of perhaps interaction between different cultures of chimpanzees and could that have changed technology and evolved technology.
2634000	2647000	Are there any theories of it is there any evidence of it and could interact with other cultures actually be a reason why some chimpanzees if they if they're more interactive other cultures, they hence have more evolution of technologies versus
2648000	2668000	Yeah, that's a really good question as well. So chimpanzees are very territorial. So if you have two neighboring communities they won't peacefully interact. The only exchange of knowledge really is females that when they read sexual maturity they migrate to a neighboring or a nearby other community.
2668000	2673000	And from the data again from the Thai forest in Ivory Coast.
2673000	2692000	What we're seeing is that these females that change community seem to adapt to the local culture. So, rather than really introducing a new way of doing it they seem to change towards doing what the locals are doing which is of course a very smart thing to do because they, they've lived in that particular environment the longest.
2692000	2707000	Then in bonobos. Again, they blow our minds they very peacefully can interact with neighboring groups so you can. I've had it happen one day that I'm following my community of bonobos and I know all the individuals and
2707000	2719000	all of a sudden I look around and there are 60 bonobos and I don't know half of them because they were just hanging out with the neighboring group and they were grooming and interacting and they might stay together for a couple of days.
2719000	2726000	So again in bonobos there would be very a lot of potential for transmission of knowledge of cultural knowledge.
2726000	2735000	And of course the fact that they don't use tools doesn't mean that bonobos don't have culture so a really nice study that came out last month or so.
2736000	2752000	Showed that different communities of bonobos seem to have different hunting cultures. So this is was observed at a site with very homogenous forest so the prey availability was the same in the different home ranges of the bonobos.
2752000	2763000	But the one community focused really on dikers so the small forest antelopes and the others were focusing more on the kind of scroll type prey.
2763000	2775000	So, indeed there could very much be there are bonobo cultures but the question is why not more technological.
2775000	2784000	Fantastic, right. The questions are starting to pour in Liam McClade that is Zubro, that is Savaila.
2784000	2794000	This may just be a rewording of John Robb's question but so initially it was believed that necessity was the mother of innovation.
2794000	2804000	Then you found out that the opportunity also played a key role in whether new innovations were developed.
2804000	2810000	Now you're finding that it also has to do with the cognitive predispositions.
2810000	2822000	So that begs the question why do the cognitive predispositions exist in the first place so I was just wondering how you would test that or if there is a way to test that.
2822000	2828000	Yeah, I think that first of all these different hypotheses are really not mutually exclusive.
2828000	2843000	So I think different factors, different pressures really work together and it might be that still necessity might sometimes also be the mother of invention it might be that at the level of innovation.
2843000	2859000	It might be that we see more exploration or innovation when energetic resources are limited which is why in this chat project we're still going to look into necessity and opportunity and relative profitability.
2859000	2871000	And it might be that the opportunities for to use are very important for transmitting and maintaining a culture. So it might be that necessity and opportunity kind of acting at different times at different levels.
2871000	2894000	And that kind of links back to your question it might be that the initial to use innovations, link back to a period of environmental change or necessity, which, as I explained in the, in the answer to john Rob might then lead to individuals that are, you know, based on where just variability
2894000	2905000	and interest in objects become better to users, and etc etc and also the individuals that are better at learning might be selected for. So you might see this culture gene co evolution going on.
2905000	2919000	So really, I don't think the question is, is it this or that it's definitely working together, we're just trying to figure out like how what's the relative importance and when are these different aspects most.
2919000	2925000	Yeah, have the most explanation of what we see.
2925000	2930000	So, I get people hear me thank you very much for lovely talk.
2930000	2940000	My question is kind of the turn john upside down and ask the question is it do we have every selection for non technology.
2940000	2948000	What are amongst these groups of evolutionarily the loss of technology.
2948000	2952000	Um,
2952000	2971000	I'm imagining what the selective pressures would be but I think what might be the case is that you only have so much time in the day, and that you might therefore have spent more time on to use or social interactions depending on on your social and ecological
2971000	2979000	setting, because what we see from these bonobos in captivity, they, they can use tools and they and they do use tools.
2979000	2994000	And but but why is, why are they using tools and not their, their wild counterparts I think that's a nice setup to test what is it about these different settings that makes the one using tools and the others.
2994000	3004000	Is it the case that in a captive setting, even if you're not all that motivated or interested you just have so much time that you end up to using anyway.
3004000	3013000	Or perhaps there are so many opportunities with objects and perhaps learning opportunities from the keepers that you end up to using anyway.
3013000	3021000	So I think we're trying to get at these different levels by also comparing wild and captive where we see such a strikingly different situation.
3021000	3037000	So that later on, of course, and that sometimes the investment in technology is actually the actual investment in the creation of the technology is much less efficient than to use the more simplified technologies that groups have had so it might be something along those lines.
3037000	3039000	Thank you very much for the answer.
3039000	3042000	Thank you.
3042000	3048000	I think you have the floor.
3048000	3050000	Thank you.
3050000	3054000	Sorry, I was just kind of wondering, can you hear me?
3054000	3055000	Yeah.
3055000	3075000	Okay, cool. I was just kind of wondering, you mentioned a little bit about how, I think for no both had more kind of social partners than chimpanzees, but they use less tools and I was wondering what you could expand a little bit on the negative relation.
3075000	3085000	I had a little bit hard time hearing exactly what you said, but I think you asked about the fact that bonobos had more social partners but are not using forging tools.
3085000	3102000	So I think what it indicates is that if, if they were using forging tools, there will be a lot of opportunity to to learn from others and to spread this knowledge and this this kind of matches some experimental findings that bonobos seem to be more tolerant than chimpanzees towards
3102000	3107000	the specifics. Why they then don't use tools.
3107000	3121000	Yeah, I don't think that's a result of having more social partners but having more social partners might be an effect of being more socially interested socially motivated than technologically motivated and whether these things are really a trade off.
3121000	3131000	I don't know it's a hypothesis that we that we want to test. Perhaps we humans can have it all and they can't. I mean, it's up in the air.
3132000	3137000	Yeah.
3137000	3141000	The questions keep them coming. You've got plenty of time.
3141000	3147000	And cat I'm sure you've got plenty of energy to respond.
3147000	3151000	Any other questions up there.
3151000	3153000	Sure.
3153000	3157000	Here we go.
3157000	3172000	Thank you very much for the talk. My question is, has been said that one of the main cultural traits of humans is that we have an accumulation of cultural traits, usually towards complexity.
3172000	3187000	Even if sometimes it is not really clear what what do they mean by complexity. And I was wondering if in chimpanzees, there are evidence dances of accumulation of these cultural traits over time.
3187000	3189000	And thank you very much for your talk.
3189000	3205000	Thank you for that question that that's a really good. I'm glad you bring that up because indeed one of the differences that is put out there is what really makes human culture difference is cumulative aspect which most likely is learned to is linked to teaching
3205000	3215000	and language and chimpanzees having culture but it not being cumulative. So you ask if there's an example at all of cumulative culture.
3215000	3223000	I think the closest we get to that is the example of termite fishing to use in Central Africa.
3223000	3239000	So these chimpanzees they use. Well, first of all, they use different types of tools for different tasks. And they also have a way of fishing for termites where they, they make a brush tip so the tool, they fray the end with their teeth.
3239000	3260000	And that actually makes it much more efficient in fishing for termites. So that seems to be one step that has been accumulated on top of just using termite fishing tools. So I think that's the closest we're coming to an example of cumulative culture in in apes.
3260000	3272000	Thank you. It looks as if the questions are perhaps slowing down now so unless anyone else has anything else they're burning to ask at could be thank you once again for a fantastic talk.
3272000	3280000	And I would like on behalf of all the department to wish you all a happy Thanksgiving.
3280000	3282000	Okay.
3282000	3297000	I hope you've all Turkey or your appropriate alternative. If you have other dietary persuasion and happy holidays looking forward for the coming month. It's been great having you all following this series it's been wonderful.
3297000	3318000	Keep with us next next year. Keep following it a new garage sequence kicking off in in late January. But in the meantime, thank you to cat. Thank you to Laurie. Thank you to all those who've been presenting and keeping the flame of discussion and debate and controversy and excitement, alive in Cambridge, right
3318000	3326000	for a really difficult period so hugely appreciated and all very best. Take care all see you soon.
