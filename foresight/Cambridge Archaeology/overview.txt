1. The speaker discusses the differences between bonobos and chimpanzees, noting that bonobos have more social partners but use fewer tools than chimpanzees. This raises questions about the relationship between social bonds and technological development.

2. There is a hypothesis that bonobos might be more tolerant of others' actions, which could explain why they don't use tools as extensively as chimpanzees. However, it's unclear if having more social partners is a result of or a trade-off with being less technologically motivated.

3. The speaker mentions that humans are known for their accumulation of cultural traits toward complexity, which is often linked to teaching and language. In contrast, chimpanzee culture is not cumulative in the same way.

4. A notable exception in chimpanzee behavior is termite fishing in Central Africa, where chimpanzees have developed a more efficient tool by fraying the end of the stick they use to fish for termites, which represents a cumulative step in their cultural practice.
