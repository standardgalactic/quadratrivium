00:00.000 --> 00:04.960
The Pirate Bay is likely one of the most infamous websites in the world.

00:04.960 --> 00:10.880
Ever since it launched in 2003, the Pirate Bay has been one of the top places to pirate movies,

00:10.880 --> 00:16.960
software, and games. As you would guess, this has enraged copyright holders and prosecutors

00:16.960 --> 00:21.920
who have been trying to shut down the site and punish pirates. But despite how many times they

00:21.920 --> 00:26.720
take it down, it seems like it's always just a matter of time until the site is back up and

00:27.600 --> 00:32.080
Considering this, you would think that the key to solving the issue is addressing the root problem

00:32.080 --> 00:37.680
by taking down the founders. But prosecutors have tried this as well. They chased the founders

00:37.680 --> 00:42.000
across the world, threw them in jail, and charged them with every copyright infringement charge

00:42.000 --> 00:48.080
you can think of. Yet, the Pirate Bay still lives on. In fact, one of the founders is actually happy

00:48.080 --> 00:53.520
to do jail time in order to keep the Pirate Bay alive. So here's how the Pirate Bay came to life,

00:53.520 --> 00:57.040
what happened to the founders, and why prosecutors have struggled to take it down.

01:01.200 --> 01:05.680
Taking a look back, the origins of the Pirate Bay date back to a Swedish organization called

01:05.680 --> 01:10.880
Piratbyron, which means the Piracy Bureau. As the name suggests, the organization focused

01:10.880 --> 01:15.040
on legalizing piracy through political connections, petitioning, and lobbying.

01:15.040 --> 01:18.800
Most people at the organization felt that information should be allowed to freely spread

01:19.200 --> 01:23.920
internet, and they questioned the idea of intellectual property. In fact, some of these

01:23.920 --> 01:28.800
guys would even argue that piracy is helpful to companies, because it gets expensive software

01:28.800 --> 01:33.360
and games into the hands of people who would have otherwise never tried it. And once they get addicted

01:33.360 --> 01:37.760
to the said game or software, they're much more likely to actually buy it the second or third time

01:37.760 --> 01:43.440
around. Now, I would never argue that piracy is moral, but there's no doubt that software like

01:43.440 --> 01:48.320
Windows, Adobe's Creative Cloud, and even Grand Theft Auto wouldn't be nearly as popular as they

01:48.320 --> 01:53.760
are today without piracy. This line of reasoning was basically the framework of Piratbyron,

01:53.760 --> 01:57.840
and in September of 2003, they would decide to take it to the next level.

01:57.840 --> 02:02.720
Three Piratbyron employees named Peter Sond, Gottfried Swartham, and Frederick Nage launched a

02:02.720 --> 02:07.120
file sharing website called the Pirate Bay. The idea was inspired by BitTorrent, which made

02:07.120 --> 02:12.720
its debut a few years before this. Originally, the Pirate Bay was run out of servers in Mexico.

02:12.720 --> 02:16.640
Gottfried convinced his employer who had servers in Mexico to help them run the site,

02:16.640 --> 02:21.920
but it didn't take long for his employer to back off. So, the founders were forced to bring the site

02:21.920 --> 02:27.840
back home, and Gottfried ran it using his Pentium 3 laptop which only had 256 megabytes of RAM.

02:27.840 --> 02:32.240
Despite the basic setup, given the limited number of file sharing sites back in 2003,

02:32.240 --> 02:37.520
it didn't take long for Pirates to flood in. By the end of 2004, the Pirate Bay saw a total of

02:37.520 --> 02:43.120
1 million users and 60,000 files being shared. As the site grew, the trio expanded their operations

02:43.120 --> 02:47.920
by getting servers and databases, and they transformed the laptop service into an international

02:47.920 --> 02:52.880
hub for file sharing. And by 2006, everything under the sun was being shared on the site,

02:52.880 --> 02:58.080
whether that be music and movies or software and games. And to make things worse, the Pirate Bay

02:58.080 --> 03:02.560
wasn't even trying to distance themselves from these activities. Some other popular piracy sites

03:02.560 --> 03:07.520
like Megadot and Z tried to put up a good guy persona in order to minimize trouble with the law.

03:07.520 --> 03:11.440
But this wasn't the case with the Pirate Bay. These guys were proud to enable free

03:11.440 --> 03:16.480
information sharing across the internet, and they had no intention of hiding behind some fake persona.

03:16.480 --> 03:20.320
And this attitude became extremely apparent to authorities after they sent out dozens of

03:20.320 --> 03:24.720
copyright infringement and seasoned assist notices which resulted in no action from the founders.

03:24.720 --> 03:29.040
The police tried to just ignore the site for many years, but as the site continued to grow in

03:29.040 --> 03:34.000
popularity, they started to receive more and more pressure to take it down. And in 2006,

03:34.000 --> 03:35.600
they finally decided to crack down.

03:35.920 --> 03:42.640
I'm sure the founders always expected trouble with the authorities given the

03:42.640 --> 03:47.120
nature of what they were doing. But I'm not sure if they expected the force at which prosecutors

03:47.120 --> 03:52.800
would hit back. On May 31, 2006, 65 police officers raided the Pirate Bay's data center

03:52.800 --> 03:57.920
and shut down their servers. None of the founders were arrested, but it was made pretty clear that

03:57.920 --> 04:03.200
the site should not be restarted. As you would guess though, the founders ignored these demands.

04:03.200 --> 04:07.280
They went ahead and got new servers in an unspecified location in the Netherlands,

04:07.280 --> 04:10.480
and the Pirate Bay was back up and running within just three days.

04:10.480 --> 04:14.560
Not only did the raid not take down the website, but it actually led to more people using the

04:14.560 --> 04:20.320
website. You see, the police raid became international news, and even the New York Times ran a story

04:20.320 --> 04:25.200
about it. Aside from driving more users to the website, these news articles fueled an international

04:25.200 --> 04:30.000
movement amongst internet nerds. One hacker went ahead and hacked into Sweden's national police

04:30.400 --> 04:35.440
website, police in the SE, and took down the website. And just as the police website was restored,

04:35.440 --> 04:40.560
the government website was taken down. Clearly, these were extremely irresponsible moves,

04:40.560 --> 04:44.560
but they definitely made a statement. Shortly after the raid, the Pirate Bay

04:44.560 --> 04:49.600
grew to be the 465th most visited website in the world, and some lawyers even jumped onto the

04:49.600 --> 04:54.320
founders side. The lawyers accused the police of unfairly impounding every server in site during

04:54.320 --> 04:59.120
the raid. You see, the servers that were impounded weren't only responsible for running the Pirate

04:59.600 --> 05:03.280
Bay, but also responsible for running dozens of small websites and businesses.

05:03.280 --> 05:07.600
So, the police had wronged all these businesses in the name of taking down one website.

05:07.600 --> 05:11.520
The lawyers also argued that the Swedish police didn't have a justifiable reason to conduct the

05:11.520 --> 05:15.760
raid in the first place. They accused the Swedish government of giving in to American political

05:15.760 --> 05:20.000
pressure instead of carrying out law and order. The government, of course, strongly denied these

05:20.000 --> 05:24.720
charges and these cases didn't really go anywhere. But the government had a nightmare dealing with

05:24.800 --> 05:29.840
all this unexpected negative PR. Initially, they expected that they would be held as the heroes

05:29.840 --> 05:34.800
fighting against piracy, but instead, they were made out to be the villains. The thing is, most

05:34.800 --> 05:40.320
people have pirated media or software at some point during their lives. Statistically, 52%

05:40.320 --> 05:45.360
of online users have watched pirated videos, even though 59% of users are aware that downloading

05:45.360 --> 05:50.400
and streaming pirated videos is illegal. And that's just the people who admitted to it.

05:50.400 --> 05:54.000
As a result, when the news came out that the Pirate Bay had been taken down,

05:54.000 --> 05:58.160
it was not like the average person was jumping up and down in excitement. The more realistic

05:58.160 --> 06:03.520
reaction was probably, oh well, it was nice while it lasted. Considering this, only a very

06:03.520 --> 06:07.520
small portion of people went out of their way to support the Swedish government's actions.

06:07.520 --> 06:11.680
And without large public support, the government couldn't just raid the Pirate Bay again because

06:11.680 --> 06:16.880
that would just increase its popularity even more. So they decided to address the route by taking down

06:16.880 --> 06:25.600
the founders. On April 17, 2009, the three founders, Peter, Frederick, and Gottfried,

06:25.600 --> 06:29.600
as well as the server provider, Karl LundstrÃ¶m, were found guilty of assistance to copyright

06:29.600 --> 06:34.480
infringement and were each sentenced to one year in prison. They were also ordered to pay a fine worth

06:34.480 --> 06:39.760
30 million Swedish kronor or 4.3 million dollars. The squad appealed the verdict arguing that Sweden

06:39.760 --> 06:44.240
gave into political pressure. This actually decreased each of their sentences by a few months,

06:44.320 --> 06:48.480
but it increased the fine to 46 million kronor or 6.6 million dollars.

06:48.480 --> 06:52.880
This didn't really matter to the founders though as they had no intention of paying the fine.

06:52.880 --> 06:56.560
Peter actually held up a sign during the press conference that followed the verdict that said,

06:56.560 --> 07:01.280
I owe you 31 million kronor. He followed up this statement by suggesting that this was all the

07:01.280 --> 07:06.000
government was going to get. He claimed that he didn't have any money and even if he did,

07:06.000 --> 07:10.880
he'd rather burn everything and not even give them the ashes. In terms of the arrest though,

07:10.880 --> 07:14.640
Karl and Peter didn't really resist much further and they simply gave in.

07:14.640 --> 07:18.800
But the same could not be said about Gottfried and Frederick who went on the run.

07:18.800 --> 07:22.800
Gottfried ran away to Cambodia which had no extradition policy to Sweden.

07:22.800 --> 07:28.560
But despite the policy, the Cambodian police arrested Gottfried on August 30th 2012 and deported

07:28.560 --> 07:33.440
him back to Sweden. There's been some speculation that Sweden and Cambodia had an insider deal

07:33.440 --> 07:38.160
to extradite Gottfried. Just six days after Gottfried was arrested, the Swedish government

07:38.160 --> 07:43.920
announced a 400 million kronor grant for Cambodia. So it is awfully suspicious but all we can do is

07:43.920 --> 07:49.280
speculate. Once Gottfried was back in Sweden, he served as your sentence at the Mary Fred prison.

07:49.280 --> 07:54.080
But the police didn't just stop right there. They also piled on hacking and fraud charges which

07:54.080 --> 08:00.160
led to a total three-year sentence. But eventually, in September of 2015, Gottfried was released.

08:00.160 --> 08:04.720
And finally, as for Frederick, he was able to evade the police for even longer than Gottfried.

08:04.720 --> 08:09.200
He had fled to Laos slash Thailand and he had built a life in both of these countries.

08:09.200 --> 08:13.040
Honestly, I don't know why he didn't just choose one or the other as this

08:13.040 --> 08:16.320
dual life resulted in him crossing the border on a regular basis.

08:16.320 --> 08:21.200
And during one of these border crossings in November of 2014, he was arrested and deported.

08:21.200 --> 08:25.680
Fortunately for Frederick, his prison sentence was far less severe than Gottfried's coming in at 10

08:25.680 --> 08:30.240
months. Frederick actually claims that prison wasn't even that bad and that it was well worth it for

08:30.240 --> 08:35.120
the pirate bay. Apparently, he was the only one in the prison that was there for a virtual crime,

08:35.120 --> 08:39.600
so the guards weren't as tough on him. He says that he was able to smuggle in USB sticks with

08:39.600 --> 08:45.280
movies on them and watch them on his prison TV. He did miss his friends and family, but he received

08:45.280 --> 08:49.920
dozens of letters from fans of the pirate bay which he says helped him get through the 10 months.

08:49.920 --> 08:54.080
Anyway, now that all the founders were behind bars, the police could finally shut down the

08:54.480 --> 08:56.880
bay once and for all, or so they thought.

09:00.560 --> 09:06.240
On December 9th, 2014, the Swedish police raided the pirate bay once again and impounded all of

09:06.240 --> 09:11.520
their servers, computers, and equipment. With the founders out of the game, this must be the end,

09:11.520 --> 09:16.560
right? Well, just four days after the pirate bay was taken down, a torrent site called

09:16.560 --> 09:22.160
ISO Hunt launched a website called oldpiratebay.org which mirrored all the content on the pirate bay.

09:22.160 --> 09:26.080
And this is when the prosecutors realized that they had lost the game forever.

09:26.080 --> 09:29.840
Here's the thing, the pirate bay doesn't actually host any files themselves.

09:29.840 --> 09:34.320
They just connect peers from around the world using links. So, all the pirate bay is storing

09:34.320 --> 09:39.200
is links. The contents of the entire website can be stored within a gigabyte, if not less,

09:39.200 --> 09:43.360
and there are thousands of people making copies of the website on a daily basis. So,

09:43.360 --> 09:47.440
even if authorities take down one copy of the site, it's not very difficult to upload a

09:47.440 --> 09:52.400
gigabyte of data to a new server and get a new domain. And that's why it's impossible to truly

09:52.400 --> 09:56.640
take down the pirate bay. Considering this, prosecutors have basically given up on taking

09:56.640 --> 10:01.200
down the pirate bay as there's simply no single person to hold accountable. In the meantime,

10:01.200 --> 10:04.720
copyright holders have shifted their efforts to working with internet service providers to cut

10:04.720 --> 10:10.160
internet to pirates. But this has just let the pirates using VPNs. Anyway, as for the founders

10:10.160 --> 10:15.040
today, Peter went ahead and founded a Patreon-type service called Flatter. Instead of donating to

10:15.040 --> 10:19.360
creators though, the service is used to donate websites and projects that better society and

10:19.360 --> 10:24.000
reveal corruption like WikiLeaks. Aside from Flatter, Peter has also given several speeches

10:24.000 --> 10:28.400
and interviews regarding his various views on the world. Godfried and Frederick on the other hand

10:28.400 --> 10:32.960
don't have nearly as big of a public image. In fact, they have no public presence at all,

10:32.960 --> 10:37.120
and they simply disappeared into the depths of the internet. After Frederick was released,

10:37.120 --> 10:41.680
he said that he was going to get an IT job and settle in Laos. So, that's presumably what he's

10:42.560 --> 10:45.600
And that's what happened to the pirate bay's founder and why the pirate bay

10:45.600 --> 10:50.720
can never be taken down. Do you guys think piracy is moral? Comment that down below.
