0	4960	The Pirate Bay is likely one of the most infamous websites in the world.
4960	10880	Ever since it launched in 2003, the Pirate Bay has been one of the top places to pirate movies,
10880	16960	software, and games. As you would guess, this has enraged copyright holders and prosecutors
16960	21920	who have been trying to shut down the site and punish pirates. But despite how many times they
21920	26720	take it down, it seems like it's always just a matter of time until the site is back up and
27600	32080	Considering this, you would think that the key to solving the issue is addressing the root problem
32080	37680	by taking down the founders. But prosecutors have tried this as well. They chased the founders
37680	42000	across the world, threw them in jail, and charged them with every copyright infringement charge
42000	48080	you can think of. Yet, the Pirate Bay still lives on. In fact, one of the founders is actually happy
48080	53520	to do jail time in order to keep the Pirate Bay alive. So here's how the Pirate Bay came to life,
53520	57040	what happened to the founders, and why prosecutors have struggled to take it down.
61200	65680	Taking a look back, the origins of the Pirate Bay date back to a Swedish organization called
65680	70880	Piratbyron, which means the Piracy Bureau. As the name suggests, the organization focused
70880	75040	on legalizing piracy through political connections, petitioning, and lobbying.
75040	78800	Most people at the organization felt that information should be allowed to freely spread
79200	83920	internet, and they questioned the idea of intellectual property. In fact, some of these
83920	88800	guys would even argue that piracy is helpful to companies, because it gets expensive software
88800	93360	and games into the hands of people who would have otherwise never tried it. And once they get addicted
93360	97760	to the said game or software, they're much more likely to actually buy it the second or third time
97760	103440	around. Now, I would never argue that piracy is moral, but there's no doubt that software like
103440	108320	Windows, Adobe's Creative Cloud, and even Grand Theft Auto wouldn't be nearly as popular as they
108320	113760	are today without piracy. This line of reasoning was basically the framework of Piratbyron,
113760	117840	and in September of 2003, they would decide to take it to the next level.
117840	122720	Three Piratbyron employees named Peter Sond, Gottfried Swartham, and Frederick Nage launched a
122720	127120	file sharing website called the Pirate Bay. The idea was inspired by BitTorrent, which made
127120	132720	its debut a few years before this. Originally, the Pirate Bay was run out of servers in Mexico.
132720	136640	Gottfried convinced his employer who had servers in Mexico to help them run the site,
136640	141920	but it didn't take long for his employer to back off. So, the founders were forced to bring the site
141920	147840	back home, and Gottfried ran it using his Pentium 3 laptop which only had 256 megabytes of RAM.
147840	152240	Despite the basic setup, given the limited number of file sharing sites back in 2003,
152240	157520	it didn't take long for Pirates to flood in. By the end of 2004, the Pirate Bay saw a total of
157520	163120	1 million users and 60,000 files being shared. As the site grew, the trio expanded their operations
163120	167920	by getting servers and databases, and they transformed the laptop service into an international
167920	172880	hub for file sharing. And by 2006, everything under the sun was being shared on the site,
172880	178080	whether that be music and movies or software and games. And to make things worse, the Pirate Bay
178080	182560	wasn't even trying to distance themselves from these activities. Some other popular piracy sites
182560	187520	like Megadot and Z tried to put up a good guy persona in order to minimize trouble with the law.
187520	191440	But this wasn't the case with the Pirate Bay. These guys were proud to enable free
191440	196480	information sharing across the internet, and they had no intention of hiding behind some fake persona.
196480	200320	And this attitude became extremely apparent to authorities after they sent out dozens of
200320	204720	copyright infringement and seasoned assist notices which resulted in no action from the founders.
204720	209040	The police tried to just ignore the site for many years, but as the site continued to grow in
209040	214000	popularity, they started to receive more and more pressure to take it down. And in 2006,
214000	215600	they finally decided to crack down.
215920	222640	I'm sure the founders always expected trouble with the authorities given the
222640	227120	nature of what they were doing. But I'm not sure if they expected the force at which prosecutors
227120	232800	would hit back. On May 31, 2006, 65 police officers raided the Pirate Bay's data center
232800	237920	and shut down their servers. None of the founders were arrested, but it was made pretty clear that
237920	243200	the site should not be restarted. As you would guess though, the founders ignored these demands.
243200	247280	They went ahead and got new servers in an unspecified location in the Netherlands,
247280	250480	and the Pirate Bay was back up and running within just three days.
250480	254560	Not only did the raid not take down the website, but it actually led to more people using the
254560	260320	website. You see, the police raid became international news, and even the New York Times ran a story
260320	265200	about it. Aside from driving more users to the website, these news articles fueled an international
265200	270000	movement amongst internet nerds. One hacker went ahead and hacked into Sweden's national police
270400	275440	website, police in the SE, and took down the website. And just as the police website was restored,
275440	280560	the government website was taken down. Clearly, these were extremely irresponsible moves,
280560	284560	but they definitely made a statement. Shortly after the raid, the Pirate Bay
284560	289600	grew to be the 465th most visited website in the world, and some lawyers even jumped onto the
289600	294320	founders side. The lawyers accused the police of unfairly impounding every server in site during
294320	299120	the raid. You see, the servers that were impounded weren't only responsible for running the Pirate
299600	303280	Bay, but also responsible for running dozens of small websites and businesses.
303280	307600	So, the police had wronged all these businesses in the name of taking down one website.
307600	311520	The lawyers also argued that the Swedish police didn't have a justifiable reason to conduct the
311520	315760	raid in the first place. They accused the Swedish government of giving in to American political
315760	320000	pressure instead of carrying out law and order. The government, of course, strongly denied these
320000	324720	charges and these cases didn't really go anywhere. But the government had a nightmare dealing with
324800	329840	all this unexpected negative PR. Initially, they expected that they would be held as the heroes
329840	334800	fighting against piracy, but instead, they were made out to be the villains. The thing is, most
334800	340320	people have pirated media or software at some point during their lives. Statistically, 52%
340320	345360	of online users have watched pirated videos, even though 59% of users are aware that downloading
345360	350400	and streaming pirated videos is illegal. And that's just the people who admitted to it.
350400	354000	As a result, when the news came out that the Pirate Bay had been taken down,
354000	358160	it was not like the average person was jumping up and down in excitement. The more realistic
358160	363520	reaction was probably, oh well, it was nice while it lasted. Considering this, only a very
363520	367520	small portion of people went out of their way to support the Swedish government's actions.
367520	371680	And without large public support, the government couldn't just raid the Pirate Bay again because
371680	376880	that would just increase its popularity even more. So they decided to address the route by taking down
376880	385600	the founders. On April 17, 2009, the three founders, Peter, Frederick, and Gottfried,
385600	389600	as well as the server provider, Karl Lundstr√∂m, were found guilty of assistance to copyright
389600	394480	infringement and were each sentenced to one year in prison. They were also ordered to pay a fine worth
394480	399760	30 million Swedish kronor or 4.3 million dollars. The squad appealed the verdict arguing that Sweden
399760	404240	gave into political pressure. This actually decreased each of their sentences by a few months,
404320	408480	but it increased the fine to 46 million kronor or 6.6 million dollars.
408480	412880	This didn't really matter to the founders though as they had no intention of paying the fine.
412880	416560	Peter actually held up a sign during the press conference that followed the verdict that said,
416560	421280	I owe you 31 million kronor. He followed up this statement by suggesting that this was all the
421280	426000	government was going to get. He claimed that he didn't have any money and even if he did,
426000	430880	he'd rather burn everything and not even give them the ashes. In terms of the arrest though,
430880	434640	Karl and Peter didn't really resist much further and they simply gave in.
434640	438800	But the same could not be said about Gottfried and Frederick who went on the run.
438800	442800	Gottfried ran away to Cambodia which had no extradition policy to Sweden.
442800	448560	But despite the policy, the Cambodian police arrested Gottfried on August 30th 2012 and deported
448560	453440	him back to Sweden. There's been some speculation that Sweden and Cambodia had an insider deal
453440	458160	to extradite Gottfried. Just six days after Gottfried was arrested, the Swedish government
458160	463920	announced a 400 million kronor grant for Cambodia. So it is awfully suspicious but all we can do is
463920	469280	speculate. Once Gottfried was back in Sweden, he served as your sentence at the Mary Fred prison.
469280	474080	But the police didn't just stop right there. They also piled on hacking and fraud charges which
474080	480160	led to a total three-year sentence. But eventually, in September of 2015, Gottfried was released.
480160	484720	And finally, as for Frederick, he was able to evade the police for even longer than Gottfried.
484720	489200	He had fled to Laos slash Thailand and he had built a life in both of these countries.
489200	493040	Honestly, I don't know why he didn't just choose one or the other as this
493040	496320	dual life resulted in him crossing the border on a regular basis.
496320	501200	And during one of these border crossings in November of 2014, he was arrested and deported.
501200	505680	Fortunately for Frederick, his prison sentence was far less severe than Gottfried's coming in at 10
505680	510240	months. Frederick actually claims that prison wasn't even that bad and that it was well worth it for
510240	515120	the pirate bay. Apparently, he was the only one in the prison that was there for a virtual crime,
515120	519600	so the guards weren't as tough on him. He says that he was able to smuggle in USB sticks with
519600	525280	movies on them and watch them on his prison TV. He did miss his friends and family, but he received
525280	529920	dozens of letters from fans of the pirate bay which he says helped him get through the 10 months.
529920	534080	Anyway, now that all the founders were behind bars, the police could finally shut down the
534480	536880	bay once and for all, or so they thought.
540560	546240	On December 9th, 2014, the Swedish police raided the pirate bay once again and impounded all of
546240	551520	their servers, computers, and equipment. With the founders out of the game, this must be the end,
551520	556560	right? Well, just four days after the pirate bay was taken down, a torrent site called
556560	562160	ISO Hunt launched a website called oldpiratebay.org which mirrored all the content on the pirate bay.
562160	566080	And this is when the prosecutors realized that they had lost the game forever.
566080	569840	Here's the thing, the pirate bay doesn't actually host any files themselves.
569840	574320	They just connect peers from around the world using links. So, all the pirate bay is storing
574320	579200	is links. The contents of the entire website can be stored within a gigabyte, if not less,
579200	583360	and there are thousands of people making copies of the website on a daily basis. So,
583360	587440	even if authorities take down one copy of the site, it's not very difficult to upload a
587440	592400	gigabyte of data to a new server and get a new domain. And that's why it's impossible to truly
592400	596640	take down the pirate bay. Considering this, prosecutors have basically given up on taking
596640	601200	down the pirate bay as there's simply no single person to hold accountable. In the meantime,
601200	604720	copyright holders have shifted their efforts to working with internet service providers to cut
604720	610160	internet to pirates. But this has just let the pirates using VPNs. Anyway, as for the founders
610160	615040	today, Peter went ahead and founded a Patreon-type service called Flatter. Instead of donating to
615040	619360	creators though, the service is used to donate websites and projects that better society and
619360	624000	reveal corruption like WikiLeaks. Aside from Flatter, Peter has also given several speeches
624000	628400	and interviews regarding his various views on the world. Godfried and Frederick on the other hand
628400	632960	don't have nearly as big of a public image. In fact, they have no public presence at all,
632960	637120	and they simply disappeared into the depths of the internet. After Frederick was released,
637120	641680	he said that he was going to get an IT job and settle in Laos. So, that's presumably what he's
642560	645600	And that's what happened to the pirate bay's founder and why the pirate bay
645600	650720	can never be taken down. Do you guys think piracy is moral? Comment that down below.
