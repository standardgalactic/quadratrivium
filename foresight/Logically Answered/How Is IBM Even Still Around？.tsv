0	19600	Once upon a time, IBM was a household name.
19600	23800	They were the most well-known computer manufacturer in the world, period.
23800	28760	But today, while people still recognize the name, virtually no one buys a computer from
28760	30040	IBM.
30040	35000	In fact, you can't even buy an IBM computer even if you wanted, given that they sold a
35000	38000	business to Lenovo nearly 20 years ago.
38000	43280	This is quite surprising, given that by all accounts, IBM was very much a first mover
43280	45360	within the PC industry.
45360	50800	They launched their first consumer PC way back in 1981, and I mean, the company's name
50800	53480	itself is International Business Machine.
53480	60200	Yet, by the late 1980s, IBM was rapidly losing market share to newcomers like Dell and Compaq.
60200	64960	Heck, even the operating system that they had funded had turned into Microsoft.
64960	70520	This downtrend only got worse in the 1990s, as IBM would go on to post the worst quarterer
70520	74840	in corporate history, having lost $4.96 billion.
74840	80280	IBM's market cap would have in value, while the S&P 500 nearly doubled.
80280	85240	Fortunately for IBM, the dotcom bubble would give them some room to breathe, as investors
85240	87840	were lenient to say the least.
87840	93120	But as the dotcom bubble collapsed in the early 2000s, focus shifted back to IBM's underperformance
93120	94960	within the PC market.
94960	99680	And this eventually led to IBM offloading their most recognizable business.
99680	104360	Considering the situation, you would think that IBM was headed towards bankruptcy, or
104360	107080	at the very least, a painful decline.
107080	110200	But the exact opposite would actually take place.
110200	114840	IBM's revenue, earnings, and market cap would all skyrocket.
114840	119720	And IBM would even overtake Microsoft for a couple of years until Microsoft had their
119720	121120	own resurgence.
121120	126800	And today, IBM stands at a market cap of $133 billion, which makes them the world's
126800	128480	98th largest company.
128480	133320	Clearly, losing within the PC industry hasn't killed off IBM altogether.
133320	143320	So here's the rise, fall, and resurrection of one of the most iconic brands of all time.
143320	149160	Taking a look back, the roots of IBM actually date back to the 1800s to four different companies,
149160	153800	which included the Bundy Manufacturing Company, the Tabulating Machine Company, the International
153800	157440	Time Recording Company, and the Computing Scale Company of America.
157440	161440	By far the most important of these was the Tabulating Machine Company.
161440	165920	This company focused on creating data processing machines for punch cards.
165920	170440	This proved to be relatively successful given that it was a must-have at manufacturing plants
170440	171800	and factories.
171800	176960	But the problem was that revenue from this business was sporadic and unreliable.
176960	182120	I mean, how many times are prominent factories going to need to buy punch card machines?
182120	184680	Maybe once a few years, if that.
184680	189200	So the founder of the company, Herman Hollerith, would shift the focus to a larger project,
189200	190880	the 1900 Census.
190880	195920	The Census challenged his machines like never before due to the raw volume and scale.
195920	200040	But Herman would successfully complete the project, which gave him some notoriety within
200040	201200	the industry.
201200	205960	Despite this, though, it didn't take him long to fall back to ground zero.
205960	211960	You see it, the US only conducts the Census once every 10 years, so revenue becomes sporadic
211960	214080	and unreliable once again.
214080	218400	While Herman very much wanted to turn this around, he was getting into his 50s and his
218400	220640	health wasn't quite holding up.
220640	226160	So he decided to sell the company to a man named Charles Flint for $2.3 million.
226160	229880	Flint would combine this with a few other businesses and create a new company called
229880	231360	CTR.
231360	236080	And very quickly, it became obvious that Flint was no rookie at business.
236080	239000	He didn't change anything technical about the company.
239000	243520	Instead, he simply focused on expanding the use cases and the sales force.
243520	248120	He would hire an executive named Thomas J. Watson, and Watson would basically become
248120	250200	the father of IBM.
250200	255160	The first thing that Watson did was hire a bunch of salesmen and teach them the intricacies
255160	256720	of enterprise sales.
256720	261880	He instilled the values of company pride, unbeatable customer service, and professionalism.
261880	265980	Watson also expanded the scope of the company from just selling punch card machines to providing
265980	269160	corporations with large-scale tabulating solutions.
269160	273640	This turned out to be extremely successful, and Watson would end up doubling the company's
273640	276920	revenue within just 4 years of taking over.
276920	283800	Pretty soon, CTR would begin expanding internationally to Europe, South America, Asia, and Australia.
283800	287920	Watson would also hone in on the company's branding and public image.
287920	292520	One of his first branding efforts was creating a company slogan, and for this, he would just
292520	296080	reuse a slogan that he thought of at his last job, Think.
296080	299440	You might recognize this slogan today with the Lenovo ThinkPad.
299440	304520	Anyway, Watson now had a company slogan, but there was still something that was really
304520	305520	irking him.
305520	307800	Watson hated the name CTR.
307800	310760	He felt that it was clunky and confining.
310760	315660	So in 1924, he would change the name of the company to IBM or International Business
315660	316760	Machine.
316760	321520	It seems like this name change may have been a bit unlucky though, as the Great Depression
321520	327560	would roll around not much later.
327560	330960	The Great Depression would hit IBM hard.
330960	335320	Given that businesses were collapsing left and right, and given that IBM was a beat
335320	339440	to be business, they had an extremely tough time keeping clients.
339440	341920	Nonetheless, Watson didn't panic.
341920	345680	He was a strong believer in the idea that if he had a great team that was building useful
345680	348400	products, demand would follow.
348400	352000	Watson would not only hire more employees during the Great Depression, but he would
352000	354000	even increase their benefits.
354000	358720	IBM was one of the first companies to provide a group life insurance, survivor benefits,
358720	360160	and paid vacations.
360160	364320	But despite Watson's positive approach, the effects of the Great Depression were very
364320	366600	much evident throughout IBM.
366600	371600	IBM was building up a massive inventory of tabulating equipment with no market to sell
371600	372600	to.
372600	378400	But as Watson was hoping, an opportunity would eventually arise and it was massive.
378400	383800	In 1935, FDR would sign into effect the Social Security Act, which required tabulating employment
383800	386360	records for 26 million people.
386360	391560	IBM was the only company that bid on this contract, and by the end of the Depression,
391560	395920	IBM would evolve from being a mid-sized company to being an industry leader.
395920	400840	Their dominance would only grow with the onset of World War II, as IBM's tabulating equipment
400840	403360	would prove instrumental in the war.
403360	408840	The Allied forces widely used IBM's equipment for mobile record units, ballistics, accounting,
408840	411480	logistics, and of course, punch cards.
411480	416840	To keep up with all this demand, IBM would grow their manufacturing capacity exponentially,
416840	420320	opening factories all across the Northeast and California.
420320	424160	Despite all this growth, Watson had a fear in the back of his mind.
424160	429320	What would happen when the war came to an end and government spending was cut substantially?
429320	433400	Watson began addressing this issue early on to prepare as much as possible.
433400	437440	He increased IBM's international presence and played a major role in the formation of
437440	439400	the World Trade Corporation.
439400	443520	But it turned out that none of this preparation was even required.
443520	448400	As soon as World War II came to an end, the US would get knees deep into the Cold War.
448400	451880	The government no longer needed tabulating equipment per se, though.
451880	456600	What they wanted was a highly intelligent machine, also known as a computer, and this
456600	459480	is what got IBM into the PC game.
459480	465120	Unfortunately, Watson never got to see this evolution as he would pass away in 1956.
465120	469680	But he very much laid the foundation for IBM's pivot into the PC market.
469680	473600	Just one year after Watson passed away, IBM would introduce the programming language
473600	474600	FORTRAN.
474800	481480	IBM would follow this up with a slew of computers such as the IBM 1401 and the IBM 1403.
481480	487320	But the breakthrough didn't happen until 1964 when they introduced the IBM System 360.
487320	491360	The feature that set apart this computer was the fact that the hardware and software were
491360	492920	no longer bundled.
492920	496400	In other words, you could upgrade it and swap software.
496400	500920	This proved to be instrumental for NASA, and NASA would end up using IBM's computers
500920	504120	to land the first humans on the moon in 1969.
504120	507480	This was no doubt the golden age for IBM.
507480	511720	But Watson's fears from 25 years ago would start coming to fruition.
511720	515880	After winning the space race, the government would heavily pull back on spending.
519800	525400	While the government pulled back their contracts, IBM was by no means in any distress.
525400	531400	Over the past 30 years, IBM had built an international brand and had major companies as clients.
531400	534240	So they were by no means going to die.
534240	539040	But given that they had maxed out on the corporate and government side of things, IBM was forced
539040	543040	to look for new ways to grow, and this led them to the public sector.
543040	548280	The only problem was that IBM had virtually no experience selling to everyday consumers,
548280	550280	and it would show.
550280	555360	IBM didn't know it at the time though, and they would launch Project Scamp in 1973.
555360	558960	This project is what would eventually lead to the introduction of IBM's first personal
558960	562600	computer in 1981 to IBM 5150.
562600	567280	This computer actually turned out to be a massive success, because it made PCs relatively
567280	569280	affordable for the first time.
569280	575600	The 5150 launched for a price of $1,600, and while that was by no means cheap as it translates
575600	580120	to $5,200, it was way cheaper than everything else on the market.
580120	585920	The Xerox Star, for example, came in at an eye-watering $16,500.
585920	589960	And while the Apple Macintosh came in at $2,500.
589960	596000	So for budget-oriented customers, which is most customers, the 5150 was the top choice.
596000	601080	This would allow for IBM to dominate the market throughout the early 1980s, but there was
601080	603080	one major problem.
603080	606920	People weren't buying IBM computers because there was some sort of unique feature to them
606920	608920	or because people loved the brand.
608920	614200	Rather, much of IBM's popularity could be explained by their price, and this is never
614200	618680	a good thing, as it almost always leads to a raise to the bottom.
618680	621080	And that's exactly what happened.
621080	625440	Dozens of new computer manufacturers like Dell popped up, but there was one key difference
625440	629120	between manufacturers like IBM and manufacturers like Dell.
629120	633560	The difference was that companies like Dell weren't computer manufacturers at all.
633560	635160	They were computer assemblers.
635160	639640	They didn't create new architectures or put together software or any of that.
639640	643840	They simply sourced the cheapest parts on the market, installed MS-DOS, and called it
643840	644840	a day.
644840	648440	This allowed them to undercut IBM by significant margins.
648440	654240	The Dell Turbo, for example, costed a mere $795, which was half of IBM.
654240	658920	And given that IBM hadn't built any brand loyalty, people switched to these counterparts
658920	660120	in a heartbeat.
660120	665480	And the harsh reality was that IBM simply could not compete at these prices.
665480	669160	They simply had far more overhead and R&D expenses.
669160	671760	IBM didn't want to call it quits, though.
671760	678120	So they just stuck around as their PC market share went year after year after year.
678120	681760	And it wasn't until after the dot-com bubble that they would finally decide to pull the
681760	684880	plug and sell their PC business to Lenovo.
684880	692840	And that marked the end of IBM's foray into consumer products.
692840	697880	While IBM had gotten destroyed in the consumer PC market, the commercial business was still
697880	699600	doing alright.
699600	704400	So they decided to double down on commercial customers, and this led them to a new goldmine
704400	708880	which was servers, databases, and of course, cloud computing.
708880	713520	Pretty soon, IBM was starting to turn things around, and it seemed like IBM was very much
713520	714680	resurrected.
714680	719200	But it wasn't all sun shines and rainbows, because their freedom within the cloud market
719200	721280	didn't last all that long.
721280	725320	Since then, basically every company under the sun has jumped onto the market, whether
725320	729720	it be Apple, Google, Dell, Oracle, or Microsoft.
729720	733960	They all want a piece of the pie, and this has led to IBM shedding much of its cloud
733960	734960	gains.
734960	739160	In fact, IBM is very much in the downtrend once again.
739160	745560	In the past 10 years, IBM's revenue has nearly halved from over $100 billion to barely $60
745560	746560	billion.
746560	750520	A similar story can be seen with their net income as well, which has shrunk from over
750520	754640	$15 billion to just $1.2 billion.
754640	758360	It seems like investors are still giving IBM a good amount of credit, as they've been
758360	761760	able to maintain a PE ratio of over 100.
761760	766360	But if IBM continues to put up lackluster performance, it's not clear how much longer
766360	768480	investors will give them leeway.
768480	770360	But that's just what I think.
770360	772320	Do you think IBM has a future?
772320	773760	Comment that down below.
773760	777880	Also, drop a like if you're grateful for IBM's contributions.
777880	781640	And of course, consider checking out our Discord community, say just for the video ideas,
781640	784720	and then consider sub-guybrains to see more questions that are logically answered.
784720	787920	Until then, I'm Hari, and I'll see you guys on the next one.
