1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,600
Once upon a time, IBM was a household name.

2
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,800
They were the most well-known computer manufacturer in the world, period.

3
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,760
But today, while people still recognize the name, virtually no one buys a computer from

4
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,040
IBM.

5
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:35,000
In fact, you can't even buy an IBM computer even if you wanted, given that they sold a

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
business to Lenovo nearly 20 years ago.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,280
This is quite surprising, given that by all accounts, IBM was very much a first mover

8
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,360
within the PC industry.

9
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,800
They launched their first consumer PC way back in 1981, and I mean, the company's name

10
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,480
itself is International Business Machine.

11
00:00:53,480 --> 00:01:00,200
Yet, by the late 1980s, IBM was rapidly losing market share to newcomers like Dell and Compaq.

12
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,960
Heck, even the operating system that they had funded had turned into Microsoft.

13
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:10,520
This downtrend only got worse in the 1990s, as IBM would go on to post the worst quarterer

14
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:14,840
in corporate history, having lost $4.96 billion.

15
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:20,280
IBM's market cap would have in value, while the S&P 500 nearly doubled.

16
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,240
Fortunately for IBM, the dotcom bubble would give them some room to breathe, as investors

17
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,840
were lenient to say the least.

18
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,120
But as the dotcom bubble collapsed in the early 2000s, focus shifted back to IBM's underperformance

19
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,960
within the PC market.

20
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,680
And this eventually led to IBM offloading their most recognizable business.

21
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,360
Considering the situation, you would think that IBM was headed towards bankruptcy, or

22
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,080
at the very least, a painful decline.

23
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:50,200
But the exact opposite would actually take place.

24
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,840
IBM's revenue, earnings, and market cap would all skyrocket.

25
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,720
And IBM would even overtake Microsoft for a couple of years until Microsoft had their

26
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,120
own resurgence.

27
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:06,800
And today, IBM stands at a market cap of $133 billion, which makes them the world's

28
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,480
98th largest company.

29
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:13,320
Clearly, losing within the PC industry hasn't killed off IBM altogether.

30
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:23,320
So here's the rise, fall, and resurrection of one of the most iconic brands of all time.

31
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:29,160
Taking a look back, the roots of IBM actually date back to the 1800s to four different companies,

32
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,800
which included the Bundy Manufacturing Company, the Tabulating Machine Company, the International

33
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,440
Time Recording Company, and the Computing Scale Company of America.

34
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,440
By far the most important of these was the Tabulating Machine Company.

35
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,920
This company focused on creating data processing machines for punch cards.

36
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,440
This proved to be relatively successful given that it was a must-have at manufacturing plants

37
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,800
and factories.

38
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,960
But the problem was that revenue from this business was sporadic and unreliable.

39
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:02,120
I mean, how many times are prominent factories going to need to buy punch card machines?

40
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,680
Maybe once a few years, if that.

41
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,200
So the founder of the company, Herman Hollerith, would shift the focus to a larger project,

42
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,880
the 1900 Census.

43
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:15,920
The Census challenged his machines like never before due to the raw volume and scale.

44
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,040
But Herman would successfully complete the project, which gave him some notoriety within

45
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,200
the industry.

46
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,960
Despite this, though, it didn't take him long to fall back to ground zero.

47
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:31,960
You see it, the US only conducts the Census once every 10 years, so revenue becomes sporadic

48
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,080
and unreliable once again.

49
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,400
While Herman very much wanted to turn this around, he was getting into his 50s and his

50
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,640
health wasn't quite holding up.

51
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:46,160
So he decided to sell the company to a man named Charles Flint for $2.3 million.

52
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,880
Flint would combine this with a few other businesses and create a new company called

53
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,360
CTR.

54
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,080
And very quickly, it became obvious that Flint was no rookie at business.

55
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,000
He didn't change anything technical about the company.

56
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,520
Instead, he simply focused on expanding the use cases and the sales force.

57
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:08,120
He would hire an executive named Thomas J. Watson, and Watson would basically become

58
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,200
the father of IBM.

59
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:15,160
The first thing that Watson did was hire a bunch of salesmen and teach them the intricacies

60
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,720
of enterprise sales.

61
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,880
He instilled the values of company pride, unbeatable customer service, and professionalism.

62
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,980
Watson also expanded the scope of the company from just selling punch card machines to providing

63
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:29,160
corporations with large-scale tabulating solutions.

64
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,640
This turned out to be extremely successful, and Watson would end up doubling the company's

65
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,920
revenue within just 4 years of taking over.

66
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:43,800
Pretty soon, CTR would begin expanding internationally to Europe, South America, Asia, and Australia.

67
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,920
Watson would also hone in on the company's branding and public image.

68
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:52,520
One of his first branding efforts was creating a company slogan, and for this, he would just

69
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,080
reuse a slogan that he thought of at his last job, Think.

70
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,440
You might recognize this slogan today with the Lenovo ThinkPad.

71
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,520
Anyway, Watson now had a company slogan, but there was still something that was really

72
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,520
irking him.

73
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,800
Watson hated the name CTR.

74
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,760
He felt that it was clunky and confining.

75
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:15,660
So in 1924, he would change the name of the company to IBM or International Business

76
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,760
Machine.

77
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:21,520
It seems like this name change may have been a bit unlucky though, as the Great Depression

78
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:27,560
would roll around not much later.

79
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,960
The Great Depression would hit IBM hard.

80
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,320
Given that businesses were collapsing left and right, and given that IBM was a beat

81
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:39,440
to be business, they had an extremely tough time keeping clients.

82
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,920
Nonetheless, Watson didn't panic.

83
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,680
He was a strong believer in the idea that if he had a great team that was building useful

84
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,400
products, demand would follow.

85
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,000
Watson would not only hire more employees during the Great Depression, but he would

86
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
even increase their benefits.

87
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,720
IBM was one of the first companies to provide a group life insurance, survivor benefits,

88
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,160
and paid vacations.

89
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,320
But despite Watson's positive approach, the effects of the Great Depression were very

90
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,600
much evident throughout IBM.

91
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:11,600
IBM was building up a massive inventory of tabulating equipment with no market to sell

92
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,600
to.

93
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:18,400
But as Watson was hoping, an opportunity would eventually arise and it was massive.

94
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,800
In 1935, FDR would sign into effect the Social Security Act, which required tabulating employment

95
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,360
records for 26 million people.

96
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:31,560
IBM was the only company that bid on this contract, and by the end of the Depression,

97
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,920
IBM would evolve from being a mid-sized company to being an industry leader.

98
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:40,840
Their dominance would only grow with the onset of World War II, as IBM's tabulating equipment

99
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,360
would prove instrumental in the war.

100
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,840
The Allied forces widely used IBM's equipment for mobile record units, ballistics, accounting,

101
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,480
logistics, and of course, punch cards.

102
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:56,840
To keep up with all this demand, IBM would grow their manufacturing capacity exponentially,

103
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,320
opening factories all across the Northeast and California.

104
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:04,160
Despite all this growth, Watson had a fear in the back of his mind.

105
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,320
What would happen when the war came to an end and government spending was cut substantially?

106
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:13,400
Watson began addressing this issue early on to prepare as much as possible.

107
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,440
He increased IBM's international presence and played a major role in the formation of

108
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,400
the World Trade Corporation.

109
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,520
But it turned out that none of this preparation was even required.

110
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,400
As soon as World War II came to an end, the US would get knees deep into the Cold War.

111
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,880
The government no longer needed tabulating equipment per se, though.

112
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:36,600
What they wanted was a highly intelligent machine, also known as a computer, and this

113
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,480
is what got IBM into the PC game.

114
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:45,120
Unfortunately, Watson never got to see this evolution as he would pass away in 1956.

115
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,680
But he very much laid the foundation for IBM's pivot into the PC market.

116
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,600
Just one year after Watson passed away, IBM would introduce the programming language

117
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,600
FORTRAN.

118
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:01,480
IBM would follow this up with a slew of computers such as the IBM 1401 and the IBM 1403.

119
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:07,320
But the breakthrough didn't happen until 1964 when they introduced the IBM System 360.

120
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:11,360
The feature that set apart this computer was the fact that the hardware and software were

121
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,920
no longer bundled.

122
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,400
In other words, you could upgrade it and swap software.

123
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,920
This proved to be instrumental for NASA, and NASA would end up using IBM's computers

124
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,120
to land the first humans on the moon in 1969.

125
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,480
This was no doubt the golden age for IBM.

126
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,720
But Watson's fears from 25 years ago would start coming to fruition.

127
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:35,880
After winning the space race, the government would heavily pull back on spending.

128
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:45,400
While the government pulled back their contracts, IBM was by no means in any distress.

129
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:51,400
Over the past 30 years, IBM had built an international brand and had major companies as clients.

130
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,240
So they were by no means going to die.

131
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,040
But given that they had maxed out on the corporate and government side of things, IBM was forced

132
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,040
to look for new ways to grow, and this led them to the public sector.

133
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,280
The only problem was that IBM had virtually no experience selling to everyday consumers,

134
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,280
and it would show.

135
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:15,360
IBM didn't know it at the time though, and they would launch Project Scamp in 1973.

136
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,960
This project is what would eventually lead to the introduction of IBM's first personal

137
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,600
computer in 1981 to IBM 5150.

138
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:27,280
This computer actually turned out to be a massive success, because it made PCs relatively

139
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,280
affordable for the first time.

140
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:35,600
The 5150 launched for a price of $1,600, and while that was by no means cheap as it translates

141
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,120
to $5,200, it was way cheaper than everything else on the market.

142
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:45,920
The Xerox Star, for example, came in at an eye-watering $16,500.

143
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,960
And while the Apple Macintosh came in at $2,500.

144
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:56,000
So for budget-oriented customers, which is most customers, the 5150 was the top choice.

145
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,080
This would allow for IBM to dominate the market throughout the early 1980s, but there was

146
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,080
one major problem.

147
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,920
People weren't buying IBM computers because there was some sort of unique feature to them

148
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,920
or because people loved the brand.

149
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:14,200
Rather, much of IBM's popularity could be explained by their price, and this is never

150
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,680
a good thing, as it almost always leads to a raise to the bottom.

151
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,080
And that's exactly what happened.

152
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:25,440
Dozens of new computer manufacturers like Dell popped up, but there was one key difference

153
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,120
between manufacturers like IBM and manufacturers like Dell.

154
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,560
The difference was that companies like Dell weren't computer manufacturers at all.

155
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,160
They were computer assemblers.

156
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:39,640
They didn't create new architectures or put together software or any of that.

157
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,840
They simply sourced the cheapest parts on the market, installed MS-DOS, and called it

158
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,840
a day.

159
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:48,440
This allowed them to undercut IBM by significant margins.

160
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:54,240
The Dell Turbo, for example, costed a mere $795, which was half of IBM.

161
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,920
And given that IBM hadn't built any brand loyalty, people switched to these counterparts

162
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,120
in a heartbeat.

163
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:05,480
And the harsh reality was that IBM simply could not compete at these prices.

164
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,160
They simply had far more overhead and R&D expenses.

165
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,760
IBM didn't want to call it quits, though.

166
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:18,120
So they just stuck around as their PC market share went year after year after year.

167
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,760
And it wasn't until after the dot-com bubble that they would finally decide to pull the

168
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,880
plug and sell their PC business to Lenovo.

169
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:32,840
And that marked the end of IBM's foray into consumer products.

170
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:37,880
While IBM had gotten destroyed in the consumer PC market, the commercial business was still

171
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,600
doing alright.

172
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,400
So they decided to double down on commercial customers, and this led them to a new goldmine

173
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,880
which was servers, databases, and of course, cloud computing.

174
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,520
Pretty soon, IBM was starting to turn things around, and it seemed like IBM was very much

175
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,680
resurrected.

176
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:59,200
But it wasn't all sun shines and rainbows, because their freedom within the cloud market

177
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,280
didn't last all that long.

178
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:05,320
Since then, basically every company under the sun has jumped onto the market, whether

179
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:09,720
it be Apple, Google, Dell, Oracle, or Microsoft.

180
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,960
They all want a piece of the pie, and this has led to IBM shedding much of its cloud

181
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,960
gains.

182
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:19,160
In fact, IBM is very much in the downtrend once again.

183
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:25,560
In the past 10 years, IBM's revenue has nearly halved from over $100 billion to barely $60

184
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,560
billion.

185
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,520
A similar story can be seen with their net income as well, which has shrunk from over

186
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:34,640
$15 billion to just $1.2 billion.

187
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:38,360
It seems like investors are still giving IBM a good amount of credit, as they've been

188
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,760
able to maintain a PE ratio of over 100.

189
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,360
But if IBM continues to put up lackluster performance, it's not clear how much longer

190
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,480
investors will give them leeway.

191
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,360
But that's just what I think.

192
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,320
Do you think IBM has a future?

193
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,760
Comment that down below.

194
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,880
Also, drop a like if you're grateful for IBM's contributions.

195
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:01,640
And of course, consider checking out our Discord community, say just for the video ideas,

196
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,720
and then consider sub-guybrains to see more questions that are logically answered.

197
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,920
Until then, I'm Hari, and I'll see you guys on the next one.
