00:00.000 --> 00:19.600
Once upon a time, IBM was a household name.

00:19.600 --> 00:23.800
They were the most well-known computer manufacturer in the world, period.

00:23.800 --> 00:28.760
But today, while people still recognize the name, virtually no one buys a computer from

00:28.760 --> 00:30.040
IBM.

00:30.040 --> 00:35.000
In fact, you can't even buy an IBM computer even if you wanted, given that they sold a

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
business to Lenovo nearly 20 years ago.

00:38.000 --> 00:43.280
This is quite surprising, given that by all accounts, IBM was very much a first mover

00:43.280 --> 00:45.360
within the PC industry.

00:45.360 --> 00:50.800
They launched their first consumer PC way back in 1981, and I mean, the company's name

00:50.800 --> 00:53.480
itself is International Business Machine.

00:53.480 --> 01:00.200
Yet, by the late 1980s, IBM was rapidly losing market share to newcomers like Dell and Compaq.

01:00.200 --> 01:04.960
Heck, even the operating system that they had funded had turned into Microsoft.

01:04.960 --> 01:10.520
This downtrend only got worse in the 1990s, as IBM would go on to post the worst quarterer

01:10.520 --> 01:14.840
in corporate history, having lost $4.96 billion.

01:14.840 --> 01:20.280
IBM's market cap would have in value, while the S&P 500 nearly doubled.

01:20.280 --> 01:25.240
Fortunately for IBM, the dotcom bubble would give them some room to breathe, as investors

01:25.240 --> 01:27.840
were lenient to say the least.

01:27.840 --> 01:33.120
But as the dotcom bubble collapsed in the early 2000s, focus shifted back to IBM's underperformance

01:33.120 --> 01:34.960
within the PC market.

01:34.960 --> 01:39.680
And this eventually led to IBM offloading their most recognizable business.

01:39.680 --> 01:44.360
Considering the situation, you would think that IBM was headed towards bankruptcy, or

01:44.360 --> 01:47.080
at the very least, a painful decline.

01:47.080 --> 01:50.200
But the exact opposite would actually take place.

01:50.200 --> 01:54.840
IBM's revenue, earnings, and market cap would all skyrocket.

01:54.840 --> 01:59.720
And IBM would even overtake Microsoft for a couple of years until Microsoft had their

01:59.720 --> 02:01.120
own resurgence.

02:01.120 --> 02:06.800
And today, IBM stands at a market cap of $133 billion, which makes them the world's

02:06.800 --> 02:08.480
98th largest company.

02:08.480 --> 02:13.320
Clearly, losing within the PC industry hasn't killed off IBM altogether.

02:13.320 --> 02:23.320
So here's the rise, fall, and resurrection of one of the most iconic brands of all time.

02:23.320 --> 02:29.160
Taking a look back, the roots of IBM actually date back to the 1800s to four different companies,

02:29.160 --> 02:33.800
which included the Bundy Manufacturing Company, the Tabulating Machine Company, the International

02:33.800 --> 02:37.440
Time Recording Company, and the Computing Scale Company of America.

02:37.440 --> 02:41.440
By far the most important of these was the Tabulating Machine Company.

02:41.440 --> 02:45.920
This company focused on creating data processing machines for punch cards.

02:45.920 --> 02:50.440
This proved to be relatively successful given that it was a must-have at manufacturing plants

02:50.440 --> 02:51.800
and factories.

02:51.800 --> 02:56.960
But the problem was that revenue from this business was sporadic and unreliable.

02:56.960 --> 03:02.120
I mean, how many times are prominent factories going to need to buy punch card machines?

03:02.120 --> 03:04.680
Maybe once a few years, if that.

03:04.680 --> 03:09.200
So the founder of the company, Herman Hollerith, would shift the focus to a larger project,

03:09.200 --> 03:10.880
the 1900 Census.

03:10.880 --> 03:15.920
The Census challenged his machines like never before due to the raw volume and scale.

03:15.920 --> 03:20.040
But Herman would successfully complete the project, which gave him some notoriety within

03:20.040 --> 03:21.200
the industry.

03:21.200 --> 03:25.960
Despite this, though, it didn't take him long to fall back to ground zero.

03:25.960 --> 03:31.960
You see it, the US only conducts the Census once every 10 years, so revenue becomes sporadic

03:31.960 --> 03:34.080
and unreliable once again.

03:34.080 --> 03:38.400
While Herman very much wanted to turn this around, he was getting into his 50s and his

03:38.400 --> 03:40.640
health wasn't quite holding up.

03:40.640 --> 03:46.160
So he decided to sell the company to a man named Charles Flint for $2.3 million.

03:46.160 --> 03:49.880
Flint would combine this with a few other businesses and create a new company called

03:49.880 --> 03:51.360
CTR.

03:51.360 --> 03:56.080
And very quickly, it became obvious that Flint was no rookie at business.

03:56.080 --> 03:59.000
He didn't change anything technical about the company.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.520
Instead, he simply focused on expanding the use cases and the sales force.

04:03.520 --> 04:08.120
He would hire an executive named Thomas J. Watson, and Watson would basically become

04:08.120 --> 04:10.200
the father of IBM.

04:10.200 --> 04:15.160
The first thing that Watson did was hire a bunch of salesmen and teach them the intricacies

04:15.160 --> 04:16.720
of enterprise sales.

04:16.720 --> 04:21.880
He instilled the values of company pride, unbeatable customer service, and professionalism.

04:21.880 --> 04:25.980
Watson also expanded the scope of the company from just selling punch card machines to providing

04:25.980 --> 04:29.160
corporations with large-scale tabulating solutions.

04:29.160 --> 04:33.640
This turned out to be extremely successful, and Watson would end up doubling the company's

04:33.640 --> 04:36.920
revenue within just 4 years of taking over.

04:36.920 --> 04:43.800
Pretty soon, CTR would begin expanding internationally to Europe, South America, Asia, and Australia.

04:43.800 --> 04:47.920
Watson would also hone in on the company's branding and public image.

04:47.920 --> 04:52.520
One of his first branding efforts was creating a company slogan, and for this, he would just

04:52.520 --> 04:56.080
reuse a slogan that he thought of at his last job, Think.

04:56.080 --> 04:59.440
You might recognize this slogan today with the Lenovo ThinkPad.

04:59.440 --> 05:04.520
Anyway, Watson now had a company slogan, but there was still something that was really

05:04.520 --> 05:05.520
irking him.

05:05.520 --> 05:07.800
Watson hated the name CTR.

05:07.800 --> 05:10.760
He felt that it was clunky and confining.

05:10.760 --> 05:15.660
So in 1924, he would change the name of the company to IBM or International Business

05:15.660 --> 05:16.760
Machine.

05:16.760 --> 05:21.520
It seems like this name change may have been a bit unlucky though, as the Great Depression

05:21.520 --> 05:27.560
would roll around not much later.

05:27.560 --> 05:30.960
The Great Depression would hit IBM hard.

05:30.960 --> 05:35.320
Given that businesses were collapsing left and right, and given that IBM was a beat

05:35.320 --> 05:39.440
to be business, they had an extremely tough time keeping clients.

05:39.440 --> 05:41.920
Nonetheless, Watson didn't panic.

05:41.920 --> 05:45.680
He was a strong believer in the idea that if he had a great team that was building useful

05:45.680 --> 05:48.400
products, demand would follow.

05:48.400 --> 05:52.000
Watson would not only hire more employees during the Great Depression, but he would

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
even increase their benefits.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.720
IBM was one of the first companies to provide a group life insurance, survivor benefits,

05:58.720 --> 06:00.160
and paid vacations.

06:00.160 --> 06:04.320
But despite Watson's positive approach, the effects of the Great Depression were very

06:04.320 --> 06:06.600
much evident throughout IBM.

06:06.600 --> 06:11.600
IBM was building up a massive inventory of tabulating equipment with no market to sell

06:11.600 --> 06:12.600
to.

06:12.600 --> 06:18.400
But as Watson was hoping, an opportunity would eventually arise and it was massive.

06:18.400 --> 06:23.800
In 1935, FDR would sign into effect the Social Security Act, which required tabulating employment

06:23.800 --> 06:26.360
records for 26 million people.

06:26.360 --> 06:31.560
IBM was the only company that bid on this contract, and by the end of the Depression,

06:31.560 --> 06:35.920
IBM would evolve from being a mid-sized company to being an industry leader.

06:35.920 --> 06:40.840
Their dominance would only grow with the onset of World War II, as IBM's tabulating equipment

06:40.840 --> 06:43.360
would prove instrumental in the war.

06:43.360 --> 06:48.840
The Allied forces widely used IBM's equipment for mobile record units, ballistics, accounting,

06:48.840 --> 06:51.480
logistics, and of course, punch cards.

06:51.480 --> 06:56.840
To keep up with all this demand, IBM would grow their manufacturing capacity exponentially,

06:56.840 --> 07:00.320
opening factories all across the Northeast and California.

07:00.320 --> 07:04.160
Despite all this growth, Watson had a fear in the back of his mind.

07:04.160 --> 07:09.320
What would happen when the war came to an end and government spending was cut substantially?

07:09.320 --> 07:13.400
Watson began addressing this issue early on to prepare as much as possible.

07:13.400 --> 07:17.440
He increased IBM's international presence and played a major role in the formation of

07:17.440 --> 07:19.400
the World Trade Corporation.

07:19.400 --> 07:23.520
But it turned out that none of this preparation was even required.

07:23.520 --> 07:28.400
As soon as World War II came to an end, the US would get knees deep into the Cold War.

07:28.400 --> 07:31.880
The government no longer needed tabulating equipment per se, though.

07:31.880 --> 07:36.600
What they wanted was a highly intelligent machine, also known as a computer, and this

07:36.600 --> 07:39.480
is what got IBM into the PC game.

07:39.480 --> 07:45.120
Unfortunately, Watson never got to see this evolution as he would pass away in 1956.

07:45.120 --> 07:49.680
But he very much laid the foundation for IBM's pivot into the PC market.

07:49.680 --> 07:53.600
Just one year after Watson passed away, IBM would introduce the programming language

07:53.600 --> 07:54.600
FORTRAN.

07:54.800 --> 08:01.480
IBM would follow this up with a slew of computers such as the IBM 1401 and the IBM 1403.

08:01.480 --> 08:07.320
But the breakthrough didn't happen until 1964 when they introduced the IBM System 360.

08:07.320 --> 08:11.360
The feature that set apart this computer was the fact that the hardware and software were

08:11.360 --> 08:12.920
no longer bundled.

08:12.920 --> 08:16.400
In other words, you could upgrade it and swap software.

08:16.400 --> 08:20.920
This proved to be instrumental for NASA, and NASA would end up using IBM's computers

08:20.920 --> 08:24.120
to land the first humans on the moon in 1969.

08:24.120 --> 08:27.480
This was no doubt the golden age for IBM.

08:27.480 --> 08:31.720
But Watson's fears from 25 years ago would start coming to fruition.

08:31.720 --> 08:35.880
After winning the space race, the government would heavily pull back on spending.

08:39.800 --> 08:45.400
While the government pulled back their contracts, IBM was by no means in any distress.

08:45.400 --> 08:51.400
Over the past 30 years, IBM had built an international brand and had major companies as clients.

08:51.400 --> 08:54.240
So they were by no means going to die.

08:54.240 --> 08:59.040
But given that they had maxed out on the corporate and government side of things, IBM was forced

08:59.040 --> 09:03.040
to look for new ways to grow, and this led them to the public sector.

09:03.040 --> 09:08.280
The only problem was that IBM had virtually no experience selling to everyday consumers,

09:08.280 --> 09:10.280
and it would show.

09:10.280 --> 09:15.360
IBM didn't know it at the time though, and they would launch Project Scamp in 1973.

09:15.360 --> 09:18.960
This project is what would eventually lead to the introduction of IBM's first personal

09:18.960 --> 09:22.600
computer in 1981 to IBM 5150.

09:22.600 --> 09:27.280
This computer actually turned out to be a massive success, because it made PCs relatively

09:27.280 --> 09:29.280
affordable for the first time.

09:29.280 --> 09:35.600
The 5150 launched for a price of $1,600, and while that was by no means cheap as it translates

09:35.600 --> 09:40.120
to $5,200, it was way cheaper than everything else on the market.

09:40.120 --> 09:45.920
The Xerox Star, for example, came in at an eye-watering $16,500.

09:45.920 --> 09:49.960
And while the Apple Macintosh came in at $2,500.

09:49.960 --> 09:56.000
So for budget-oriented customers, which is most customers, the 5150 was the top choice.

09:56.000 --> 10:01.080
This would allow for IBM to dominate the market throughout the early 1980s, but there was

10:01.080 --> 10:03.080
one major problem.

10:03.080 --> 10:06.920
People weren't buying IBM computers because there was some sort of unique feature to them

10:06.920 --> 10:08.920
or because people loved the brand.

10:08.920 --> 10:14.200
Rather, much of IBM's popularity could be explained by their price, and this is never

10:14.200 --> 10:18.680
a good thing, as it almost always leads to a raise to the bottom.

10:18.680 --> 10:21.080
And that's exactly what happened.

10:21.080 --> 10:25.440
Dozens of new computer manufacturers like Dell popped up, but there was one key difference

10:25.440 --> 10:29.120
between manufacturers like IBM and manufacturers like Dell.

10:29.120 --> 10:33.560
The difference was that companies like Dell weren't computer manufacturers at all.

10:33.560 --> 10:35.160
They were computer assemblers.

10:35.160 --> 10:39.640
They didn't create new architectures or put together software or any of that.

10:39.640 --> 10:43.840
They simply sourced the cheapest parts on the market, installed MS-DOS, and called it

10:43.840 --> 10:44.840
a day.

10:44.840 --> 10:48.440
This allowed them to undercut IBM by significant margins.

10:48.440 --> 10:54.240
The Dell Turbo, for example, costed a mere $795, which was half of IBM.

10:54.240 --> 10:58.920
And given that IBM hadn't built any brand loyalty, people switched to these counterparts

10:58.920 --> 11:00.120
in a heartbeat.

11:00.120 --> 11:05.480
And the harsh reality was that IBM simply could not compete at these prices.

11:05.480 --> 11:09.160
They simply had far more overhead and R&D expenses.

11:09.160 --> 11:11.760
IBM didn't want to call it quits, though.

11:11.760 --> 11:18.120
So they just stuck around as their PC market share went year after year after year.

11:18.120 --> 11:21.760
And it wasn't until after the dot-com bubble that they would finally decide to pull the

11:21.760 --> 11:24.880
plug and sell their PC business to Lenovo.

11:24.880 --> 11:32.840
And that marked the end of IBM's foray into consumer products.

11:32.840 --> 11:37.880
While IBM had gotten destroyed in the consumer PC market, the commercial business was still

11:37.880 --> 11:39.600
doing alright.

11:39.600 --> 11:44.400
So they decided to double down on commercial customers, and this led them to a new goldmine

11:44.400 --> 11:48.880
which was servers, databases, and of course, cloud computing.

11:48.880 --> 11:53.520
Pretty soon, IBM was starting to turn things around, and it seemed like IBM was very much

11:53.520 --> 11:54.680
resurrected.

11:54.680 --> 11:59.200
But it wasn't all sun shines and rainbows, because their freedom within the cloud market

11:59.200 --> 12:01.280
didn't last all that long.

12:01.280 --> 12:05.320
Since then, basically every company under the sun has jumped onto the market, whether

12:05.320 --> 12:09.720
it be Apple, Google, Dell, Oracle, or Microsoft.

12:09.720 --> 12:13.960
They all want a piece of the pie, and this has led to IBM shedding much of its cloud

12:13.960 --> 12:14.960
gains.

12:14.960 --> 12:19.160
In fact, IBM is very much in the downtrend once again.

12:19.160 --> 12:25.560
In the past 10 years, IBM's revenue has nearly halved from over $100 billion to barely $60

12:25.560 --> 12:26.560
billion.

12:26.560 --> 12:30.520
A similar story can be seen with their net income as well, which has shrunk from over

12:30.520 --> 12:34.640
$15 billion to just $1.2 billion.

12:34.640 --> 12:38.360
It seems like investors are still giving IBM a good amount of credit, as they've been

12:38.360 --> 12:41.760
able to maintain a PE ratio of over 100.

12:41.760 --> 12:46.360
But if IBM continues to put up lackluster performance, it's not clear how much longer

12:46.360 --> 12:48.480
investors will give them leeway.

12:48.480 --> 12:50.360
But that's just what I think.

12:50.360 --> 12:52.320
Do you think IBM has a future?

12:52.320 --> 12:53.760
Comment that down below.

12:53.760 --> 12:57.880
Also, drop a like if you're grateful for IBM's contributions.

12:57.880 --> 13:01.640
And of course, consider checking out our Discord community, say just for the video ideas,

13:01.640 --> 13:04.720
and then consider sub-guybrains to see more questions that are logically answered.

13:04.720 --> 13:07.920
Until then, I'm Hari, and I'll see you guys on the next one.
