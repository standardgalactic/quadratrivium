1. The Pirate Bay, a popular file-sharing website, faced legal challenges in Sweden due to copyright infringement issues.
2. Founders of The Pirate Bay were targeted by authorities, with Gottfried Svartholm Warg and Fredrik Neij being the most prominently charged.

4. Gottfried was sentenced to 10 months in prison followed by a fine of 400,000 Swedish kronor upon his release, while Fredrik received a 10-month sentence.
5. Despite the legal battles, The Pirate Bay continued to operate, even after the founders were incarcerated.
6. In December 2014, Swedish police raided The Pirate Bay's servers and impounded them, assuming this would shut down the site.
7. However, a mirror of The Pirate Bay called oldpiratebay.org was launched just four days later, showcasing the site's resilience and decentralized nature.
8. Due to its decentralized infrastructure, The Pirate Bay cannot be permanently shut down because its content can be replicated across various servers worldwide.

Checking Logically Answered/How Is IBM Even Still Around？.txt
 IBM's journey into personal computing began with Project Scamp in 1973, leading to the release of the IBM 5150 in 1981, which was a significant breakthrough in affordability and popularity for PCs. However, the market quickly became saturated with competitors who could produce similar computers at even lower prices. Companies like Dell capitalized on this by becoming computer assemblers, leveraging cheaper parts and MS-DOS to undercut IBM's pricing. Despite IBM's attempts to maintain its position, it eventually sold its PC division to Lenovo in 2005.

IBM shifted focus to its commercial business, succeeding in servers, databases, and later cloud computing. However, the market for cloud services has since become highly competitive, with many major players like Google, Apple, Oracle, and Microsoft also seeking a share. IBM's revenue and net income have both significantly decreased over the past decade, raising questions about its future. Despite this, investors continue to show confidence in IBM, as reflected in its high PE ratio. The company's longevity and resilience remain to be seen, with many awaiting its next move in an ever-evolving technological landscape.
