1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,960
The Pirate Bay is likely one of the most infamous websites in the world.

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:10,880
Ever since it launched in 2003, the Pirate Bay has been one of the top places to pirate movies,

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,960
software, and games. As you would guess, this has enraged copyright holders and prosecutors

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,920
who have been trying to shut down the site and punish pirates. But despite how many times they

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,720
take it down, it seems like it's always just a matter of time until the site is back up and

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,080
Considering this, you would think that the key to solving the issue is addressing the root problem

7
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:37,680
by taking down the founders. But prosecutors have tried this as well. They chased the founders

8
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,000
across the world, threw them in jail, and charged them with every copyright infringement charge

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,080
you can think of. Yet, the Pirate Bay still lives on. In fact, one of the founders is actually happy

10
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:53,520
to do jail time in order to keep the Pirate Bay alive. So here's how the Pirate Bay came to life,

11
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,040
what happened to the founders, and why prosecutors have struggled to take it down.

12
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,680
Taking a look back, the origins of the Pirate Bay date back to a Swedish organization called

13
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,880
Piratbyron, which means the Piracy Bureau. As the name suggests, the organization focused

14
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,040
on legalizing piracy through political connections, petitioning, and lobbying.

15
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,800
Most people at the organization felt that information should be allowed to freely spread

16
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,920
internet, and they questioned the idea of intellectual property. In fact, some of these

17
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,800
guys would even argue that piracy is helpful to companies, because it gets expensive software

18
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,360
and games into the hands of people who would have otherwise never tried it. And once they get addicted

19
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,760
to the said game or software, they're much more likely to actually buy it the second or third time

20
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:43,440
around. Now, I would never argue that piracy is moral, but there's no doubt that software like

21
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:48,320
Windows, Adobe's Creative Cloud, and even Grand Theft Auto wouldn't be nearly as popular as they

22
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,760
are today without piracy. This line of reasoning was basically the framework of Piratbyron,

23
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,840
and in September of 2003, they would decide to take it to the next level.

24
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,720
Three Piratbyron employees named Peter Sond, Gottfried Swartham, and Frederick Nage launched a

25
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:07,120
file sharing website called the Pirate Bay. The idea was inspired by BitTorrent, which made

26
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:12,720
its debut a few years before this. Originally, the Pirate Bay was run out of servers in Mexico.

27
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,640
Gottfried convinced his employer who had servers in Mexico to help them run the site,

28
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,920
but it didn't take long for his employer to back off. So, the founders were forced to bring the site

29
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:27,840
back home, and Gottfried ran it using his Pentium 3 laptop which only had 256 megabytes of RAM.

30
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,240
Despite the basic setup, given the limited number of file sharing sites back in 2003,

31
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:37,520
it didn't take long for Pirates to flood in. By the end of 2004, the Pirate Bay saw a total of

32
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:43,120
1 million users and 60,000 files being shared. As the site grew, the trio expanded their operations

33
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,920
by getting servers and databases, and they transformed the laptop service into an international

34
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,880
hub for file sharing. And by 2006, everything under the sun was being shared on the site,

35
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:58,080
whether that be music and movies or software and games. And to make things worse, the Pirate Bay

36
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,560
wasn't even trying to distance themselves from these activities. Some other popular piracy sites

37
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,520
like Megadot and Z tried to put up a good guy persona in order to minimize trouble with the law.

38
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,440
But this wasn't the case with the Pirate Bay. These guys were proud to enable free

39
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,480
information sharing across the internet, and they had no intention of hiding behind some fake persona.

40
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,320
And this attitude became extremely apparent to authorities after they sent out dozens of

41
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,720
copyright infringement and seasoned assist notices which resulted in no action from the founders.

42
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,040
The police tried to just ignore the site for many years, but as the site continued to grow in

43
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,000
popularity, they started to receive more and more pressure to take it down. And in 2006,

44
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,600
they finally decided to crack down.

45
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:42,640
I'm sure the founders always expected trouble with the authorities given the

46
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,120
nature of what they were doing. But I'm not sure if they expected the force at which prosecutors

47
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,800
would hit back. On May 31, 2006, 65 police officers raided the Pirate Bay's data center

48
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:57,920
and shut down their servers. None of the founders were arrested, but it was made pretty clear that

49
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:03,200
the site should not be restarted. As you would guess though, the founders ignored these demands.

50
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,280
They went ahead and got new servers in an unspecified location in the Netherlands,

51
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,480
and the Pirate Bay was back up and running within just three days.

52
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,560
Not only did the raid not take down the website, but it actually led to more people using the

53
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:20,320
website. You see, the police raid became international news, and even the New York Times ran a story

54
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,200
about it. Aside from driving more users to the website, these news articles fueled an international

55
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:30,000
movement amongst internet nerds. One hacker went ahead and hacked into Sweden's national police

56
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,440
website, police in the SE, and took down the website. And just as the police website was restored,

57
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,560
the government website was taken down. Clearly, these were extremely irresponsible moves,

58
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,560
but they definitely made a statement. Shortly after the raid, the Pirate Bay

59
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,600
grew to be the 465th most visited website in the world, and some lawyers even jumped onto the

60
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,320
founders side. The lawyers accused the police of unfairly impounding every server in site during

61
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,120
the raid. You see, the servers that were impounded weren't only responsible for running the Pirate

62
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,280
Bay, but also responsible for running dozens of small websites and businesses.

63
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,600
So, the police had wronged all these businesses in the name of taking down one website.

64
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,520
The lawyers also argued that the Swedish police didn't have a justifiable reason to conduct the

65
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,760
raid in the first place. They accused the Swedish government of giving in to American political

66
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:20,000
pressure instead of carrying out law and order. The government, of course, strongly denied these

67
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,720
charges and these cases didn't really go anywhere. But the government had a nightmare dealing with

68
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,840
all this unexpected negative PR. Initially, they expected that they would be held as the heroes

69
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,800
fighting against piracy, but instead, they were made out to be the villains. The thing is, most

70
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,320
people have pirated media or software at some point during their lives. Statistically, 52%

71
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,360
of online users have watched pirated videos, even though 59% of users are aware that downloading

72
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,400
and streaming pirated videos is illegal. And that's just the people who admitted to it.

73
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,000
As a result, when the news came out that the Pirate Bay had been taken down,

74
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,160
it was not like the average person was jumping up and down in excitement. The more realistic

75
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,520
reaction was probably, oh well, it was nice while it lasted. Considering this, only a very

76
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,520
small portion of people went out of their way to support the Swedish government's actions.

77
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,680
And without large public support, the government couldn't just raid the Pirate Bay again because

78
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,880
that would just increase its popularity even more. So they decided to address the route by taking down

79
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:25,600
the founders. On April 17, 2009, the three founders, Peter, Frederick, and Gottfried,

80
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,600
as well as the server provider, Karl LundstrÃ¶m, were found guilty of assistance to copyright

81
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,480
infringement and were each sentenced to one year in prison. They were also ordered to pay a fine worth

82
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:39,760
30 million Swedish kronor or 4.3 million dollars. The squad appealed the verdict arguing that Sweden

83
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:44,240
gave into political pressure. This actually decreased each of their sentences by a few months,

84
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:48,480
but it increased the fine to 46 million kronor or 6.6 million dollars.

85
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:52,880
This didn't really matter to the founders though as they had no intention of paying the fine.

86
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,560
Peter actually held up a sign during the press conference that followed the verdict that said,

87
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,280
I owe you 31 million kronor. He followed up this statement by suggesting that this was all the

88
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,000
government was going to get. He claimed that he didn't have any money and even if he did,

89
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,880
he'd rather burn everything and not even give them the ashes. In terms of the arrest though,

90
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,640
Karl and Peter didn't really resist much further and they simply gave in.

91
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:18,800
But the same could not be said about Gottfried and Frederick who went on the run.

92
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,800
Gottfried ran away to Cambodia which had no extradition policy to Sweden.

93
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:28,560
But despite the policy, the Cambodian police arrested Gottfried on August 30th 2012 and deported

94
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,440
him back to Sweden. There's been some speculation that Sweden and Cambodia had an insider deal

95
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,160
to extradite Gottfried. Just six days after Gottfried was arrested, the Swedish government

96
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,920
announced a 400 million kronor grant for Cambodia. So it is awfully suspicious but all we can do is

97
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:49,280
speculate. Once Gottfried was back in Sweden, he served as your sentence at the Mary Fred prison.

98
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:54,080
But the police didn't just stop right there. They also piled on hacking and fraud charges which

99
00:07:54,080 --> 00:08:00,160
led to a total three-year sentence. But eventually, in September of 2015, Gottfried was released.

100
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,720
And finally, as for Frederick, he was able to evade the police for even longer than Gottfried.

101
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,200
He had fled to Laos slash Thailand and he had built a life in both of these countries.

102
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:13,040
Honestly, I don't know why he didn't just choose one or the other as this

103
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,320
dual life resulted in him crossing the border on a regular basis.

104
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:21,200
And during one of these border crossings in November of 2014, he was arrested and deported.

105
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,680
Fortunately for Frederick, his prison sentence was far less severe than Gottfried's coming in at 10

106
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,240
months. Frederick actually claims that prison wasn't even that bad and that it was well worth it for

107
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,120
the pirate bay. Apparently, he was the only one in the prison that was there for a virtual crime,

108
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,600
so the guards weren't as tough on him. He says that he was able to smuggle in USB sticks with

109
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:45,280
movies on them and watch them on his prison TV. He did miss his friends and family, but he received

110
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:49,920
dozens of letters from fans of the pirate bay which he says helped him get through the 10 months.

111
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,080
Anyway, now that all the founders were behind bars, the police could finally shut down the

112
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,880
bay once and for all, or so they thought.

113
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:06,240
On December 9th, 2014, the Swedish police raided the pirate bay once again and impounded all of

114
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,520
their servers, computers, and equipment. With the founders out of the game, this must be the end,

115
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:16,560
right? Well, just four days after the pirate bay was taken down, a torrent site called

116
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:22,160
ISO Hunt launched a website called oldpiratebay.org which mirrored all the content on the pirate bay.

117
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,080
And this is when the prosecutors realized that they had lost the game forever.

118
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,840
Here's the thing, the pirate bay doesn't actually host any files themselves.

119
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:34,320
They just connect peers from around the world using links. So, all the pirate bay is storing

120
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,200
is links. The contents of the entire website can be stored within a gigabyte, if not less,

121
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,360
and there are thousands of people making copies of the website on a daily basis. So,

122
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,440
even if authorities take down one copy of the site, it's not very difficult to upload a

123
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,400
gigabyte of data to a new server and get a new domain. And that's why it's impossible to truly

124
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,640
take down the pirate bay. Considering this, prosecutors have basically given up on taking

125
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:01,200
down the pirate bay as there's simply no single person to hold accountable. In the meantime,

126
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,720
copyright holders have shifted their efforts to working with internet service providers to cut

127
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:10,160
internet to pirates. But this has just let the pirates using VPNs. Anyway, as for the founders

128
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,040
today, Peter went ahead and founded a Patreon-type service called Flatter. Instead of donating to

129
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,360
creators though, the service is used to donate websites and projects that better society and

130
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,000
reveal corruption like WikiLeaks. Aside from Flatter, Peter has also given several speeches

131
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,400
and interviews regarding his various views on the world. Godfried and Frederick on the other hand

132
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:32,960
don't have nearly as big of a public image. In fact, they have no public presence at all,

133
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:37,120
and they simply disappeared into the depths of the internet. After Frederick was released,

134
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,680
he said that he was going to get an IT job and settle in Laos. So, that's presumably what he's

135
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,600
And that's what happened to the pirate bay's founder and why the pirate bay

136
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,720
can never be taken down. Do you guys think piracy is moral? Comment that down below.
