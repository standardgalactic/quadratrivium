Processing Overview for The Last Theory

Checking The Last Theory/Where's the evidence for Wolfram Physicsï¼Ÿ with Jonathan Gorard.txt
1. **Gravitational Wave Simulations**: In the context of Wolfram physics, numerical simulations of black hole inspirals can reveal discretization effects due to the causal effect system's resolution limit at large scales. These effects manifest as deviations from the expected quadrupole moment in gravitational wave signatures. As gravitational wave observatories become more precise, they may start detecting these small corrections, which are actually numerical errors from a continuous theory perspective.

2. **Quantum Mechanics Predictions**: The Wolfram model predicts that there's a maximum speed at which quantum states can become entangled. This is due to the geometric representation of tensor products and Hilbert spaces in the model through branchial graphs, which have a metric that defines the rate of entanglement. While this speed is extremely high and not noticeable in everyday events, it could potentially be measured experimentally. The Wolfram model offers new bounds for entanglement speeds, complementing existing bounds like the Margolis-Levitin bound.

3. **Phenomenological and Experimental Predictions**: The advancement of phenomenological predictions from the Wolfram model is currently hindered by a lack of personnel with expertise in experimental physics. There's a need for someone with the ability to bridge the gap between the mathematical framework of the Wolfram model and real-world experimental data, much like the late Abdus Salam did for electromagnetic interactions and the electroweak theory.

4. **Community and Collaboration**: The Wolfram physics community is strong in computer science and mathematics but lacks theoretical physicists who can translate the model's predictions into experimental tests. There's an ongoing effort to attract more phenomenological and experimental physicists to work on the project.

5. **Outreach and Engagement**: To foster progress, the team behind "Last Theory" offers various resources like a newsletter, podcasts, and YouTube videos to engage with a broader audience and potentially attract the right talent to tackle the phenomenological challenges of the Wolfram model. The goal is to establish this as a significant scientific breakthrough, emphasizing the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration.
