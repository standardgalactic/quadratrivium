00:00.000 --> 00:06.160
Well, actually the first time I wrote about this was for a little site before my blog

00:06.160 --> 00:17.480
in 2005, and so at the time really I was thinking about the age-old problem of the Austrian

00:17.480 --> 00:24.200
theory of money, which is really first elucidated by Karl Manger, which is the question of why

00:24.200 --> 00:28.760
certain kinds of goods seem to have anomalous value.

00:28.760 --> 00:35.360
Well, of course, often focus on the material utility of the classic, you know, sort of

00:35.360 --> 00:40.640
pre-modern monetary standards of precious metals, and they're like, ooh, it's valuable.

00:40.640 --> 00:48.360
But in fact, these goods are grossly overvalued, considering if you analyze them as simply

00:48.360 --> 00:50.960
as commodities, they don't make sense.

00:50.960 --> 00:58.240
You see an enormous stock of these commodities, and that stock keeps being accumulated instead

00:58.240 --> 01:06.680
of drawn down, and the price is wildly disproportionate to the demand for industrial use of these goods.

01:06.680 --> 01:13.920
So there's obviously something sort of interesting going on here, and the simplest way to think

01:13.920 --> 01:20.120
about it is that money is essentially a store of value, it's a medium of savings.

01:20.120 --> 01:25.320
It's a way that you move purchasing power from the present into the future.

01:25.320 --> 01:30.720
Even in the presence of financial instruments like bonds don't really change the need to

01:30.720 --> 01:37.280
physically shift purchasing power from the present to the future, even if you lend money

01:37.280 --> 01:41.080
to be returned in the future, you're lending it to someone who therefore is holding money.

01:41.080 --> 01:44.640
So lending abstractly should not change the demand for money.

01:44.640 --> 01:47.800
So there's always a demand for some such good.

01:47.800 --> 01:54.760
And when you look at the sort of game theory of the demand for this good, which is sort

01:54.800 --> 02:03.240
of uses some concepts that the classical Austrians didn't really have at hand, you see that you're

02:03.240 --> 02:16.920
basically looking at a coordination problem, because you have to standardize on some store

02:16.920 --> 02:19.560
of value, which is going to be overvalued.

02:19.560 --> 02:25.520
And so you have at least one good that has to be overvalued in an economy.

02:25.520 --> 02:33.400
But if you have more than one, that's an unstable competition, whereas to have exactly one, and

02:33.400 --> 02:38.160
you know, there can be only one, as they used to say in the movie Highlander, a great, great,

02:38.160 --> 02:46.760
great 80s movie, the so the stable state of the system just very, very abstractly is a

02:46.800 --> 02:50.600
state in which there is one dominant money.

02:50.600 --> 02:59.160
And so what happens when that standard is created or when standards change, which is a very, you

02:59.160 --> 03:05.840
know, sort of cataclysmic financial event, this, of course, is the, you know, the Bitcoin

03:05.840 --> 03:12.640
hyper monetization, Bitcoin maximalism, essentially theory, what happens when one of these

03:12.680 --> 03:19.160
standards is created is basically people move their savings into this good.

03:19.160 --> 03:25.600
And if this good is an appropriate money, appreciating its price will not substantially

03:25.600 --> 03:32.240
appreciate its supply, which is obviously very important, and violated a little bit in the

03:32.240 --> 03:33.480
case of the precious metals.

03:33.480 --> 03:38.000
I mean, when the gold price goes up, it increases gold mining a little bit, but the amount of

03:38.000 --> 03:42.680
newly mined gold is still quite small compared to the world gold stock.

03:43.160 --> 03:52.280
And so what will happen is that basically people will buy this good up in sort of exactly the

03:52.280 --> 03:58.400
same way as GameStop stock was bought up last year.

03:58.760 --> 04:07.680
And so when something goes up, because everyone is buying in, and not because it has

04:08.080 --> 04:12.200
any intrinsic value or utility, that looks like a bubble.

04:12.400 --> 04:14.560
It's in fact the same thing as a bubble.

04:14.600 --> 04:20.080
And so when we look at, you know, sort of a financial bubble, we can see sort of an

04:20.080 --> 04:23.560
attempt to restandardize a money.

04:23.560 --> 04:29.800
And that attempt is sort of if the bubble pops, you know, and there are various ways

04:29.800 --> 04:34.880
that certainly Bitcoin could, in theory, pop, if the bubble pops, it looks like this

04:34.880 --> 04:37.200
ridiculous tulip scam all over again.

04:37.520 --> 04:42.720
If it goes to completion, it looks like, you know, you bought into, you know, this incredible

04:42.720 --> 04:44.840
thing, you know, very early.

04:44.840 --> 04:56.120
And so, you know, the general cause for sort of an intrinsic demand to restandardize money

04:56.120 --> 05:02.120
today is basically monetary dilution.

05:02.120 --> 05:06.960
And when I say monetary dilution, most people will sort of define the stock of

05:07.400 --> 05:13.360
money in dollars using very narrow instruments, like M0, M1.

05:13.640 --> 05:21.760
I prefer to basically describe the stock of dollars as the total net worth in dollars of

05:21.760 --> 05:25.160
all people holding dollars and dollar denominated financial instruments and

05:25.160 --> 05:26.200
financed assets.

05:26.560 --> 05:32.520
And that's essentially defining the dollar supply as the sum of personal net worth,

05:32.520 --> 05:35.400
which is a statistic, I don't know how accurate it is.

05:35.720 --> 05:38.480
It's a statistic that, you know, the Fed keeps.

05:38.800 --> 05:45.160
And so when you see personal net worth, I think in like 2021, it may have gone up by

05:46.240 --> 05:51.040
or 2020 to 21, it was going up by 20 trillion dollars a year.

05:51.720 --> 05:56.960
This is obviously not the stuff that we have is getting 20 trillion dollars more valuable.

05:57.360 --> 05:59.720
You know, maybe we have wine and the wine is aging.

06:01.240 --> 06:03.080
I don't think that's how it's working.

06:03.440 --> 06:12.560
It's basically a sort of this way of creating dollars broadly stated when the stock

06:12.560 --> 06:14.600
market goes up, everyone feels good.

06:14.880 --> 06:18.560
It is no different from printing money and sending it primarily to rich people.

06:19.120 --> 06:23.360
And so what you're doing, you know, you're actually running this very cynical

06:23.360 --> 06:24.840
economy that's doing two things.

06:24.840 --> 06:29.320
One is that it's running on the basis of printing money and sending it to rich people.

06:29.320 --> 06:35.320
Another way to see that is that the economy is actually losing 20 trillion dollars a year

06:35.320 --> 06:36.960
because those are liabilities.

06:37.400 --> 06:41.320
Your stock, you know, when the stock market goes up, you're creating liabilities.

06:41.440 --> 06:43.360
Equity is a liability on a balance sheet.

06:43.680 --> 06:49.040
And so, you know, when basically the total financed value of this financial asset is

06:49.040 --> 06:53.640
increasing, what you're seeing is that basically 20 trillion dollars got created out

06:53.640 --> 06:57.760
of thin air, basically 20 trillion dollars got borrowed out of thin air because those

06:57.760 --> 07:00.640
companies now have to justify, in theory, those valuations.

07:01.000 --> 07:08.080
So in practice, you know, you're looking at this very strange system where if you set

07:08.080 --> 07:12.360
interest rates to basically zero, which is a very strange thing to do, not least because

07:12.360 --> 07:19.560
the valuation of financial assets tends to use equations in which the interest rate is

07:19.560 --> 07:21.120
a denominator.

07:21.240 --> 07:26.640
And so we sort of have with all of the like, wee, free money for everyone.

07:26.640 --> 07:32.240
Everyone's 401k went up, you know, experience of, you know, not just the last two years,

07:32.240 --> 07:38.440
but, you know, before this latest, but more like the last, you know, I mean, since

07:38.440 --> 07:44.800
Allen Greenspan, right, you're basically watching the sort of huge red ink factory and

07:44.800 --> 07:51.120
you're seeing a nation that is basically living pretty much on debt, like a very rich

07:51.120 --> 07:53.200
person who's so rich that he can just keep borrowing.

07:53.600 --> 07:59.720
And so, you know, that sort of experience of a nation living on debt sort of does a

07:59.720 --> 08:00.480
couple of things.

08:00.520 --> 08:04.920
That's obviously very destructive to the real economy, not that there is much of a

08:04.920 --> 08:11.760
real economy left, but, you know, it does a lot of damage to the real economy, but

08:11.760 --> 08:18.720
also from a financial perspective, it causes all assets to basically you have to, you

08:18.720 --> 08:20.480
know, move, you can't just hold cash.

08:20.480 --> 08:24.880
You have to move your money around in such a way that it benefits from this, you know,

08:24.880 --> 08:26.280
beneficent force.

08:26.280 --> 08:32.680
And so it basically makes everything want to get out of cold dollars into things like,

08:32.680 --> 08:36.800
you know, index funds, you know, we have this interesting concept of passive investing,

08:36.800 --> 08:41.080
which is in total defiance of all economic theory, you know, the reason you invest is

08:41.080 --> 08:46.800
that you're adding value to the market, right, or you're lending, but like passive

08:46.840 --> 08:51.360
investing is like, you know, we, I have an index funded, it magically goes up.

08:51.680 --> 08:53.680
And everyone can somehow make a profit off of that.

08:53.680 --> 08:53.960
Right, right, right.

08:53.960 --> 08:58.160
And so basically, like, you know, but the one thing money doesn't want to be is just

08:58.160 --> 09:02.760
playing cold dollars, because just playing cold dollars don't participate in this, except

09:02.760 --> 09:08.000
in the event of the expansion motor turns off when the whole thing begins to rapidly

09:08.000 --> 09:11.320
collapse as, you know, it's done a bit of this year.

09:11.680 --> 09:16.320
And then you really want to be holding cold, cold, hard cash, which brings us perhaps to

09:16.320 --> 09:18.720
another topic, which is a competitor money.

09:18.760 --> 09:19.720
Yes, exactly.

09:19.720 --> 09:26.240
And so, and so, you know, the ability to, you know, just the fact of the dollar

09:26.240 --> 09:33.160
supply inflating inflates the potential demand, assuming even just assuming sort of constant

09:33.200 --> 09:36.360
influx for this other money.

09:36.600 --> 09:40.720
And so basically, what you're seeing is you're seeing that the whole dollar system,

09:40.720 --> 09:45.120
when it's expanding like this, and it needs to expand because the economy is losing

09:45.120 --> 09:48.840
money, you need to like, to generate consumer spending, you need to be printing new

09:48.840 --> 09:51.440
money by giving it to boomers and their retirement accounts.

09:51.800 --> 09:52.160
Right.

09:52.160 --> 10:00.360
And so, you know, if this system, like, I mean, like, it can't like what you're

10:00.360 --> 10:03.480
seeing right now, for example, with the fed raising interest rates and creating a

10:03.480 --> 10:09.240
recession, it's like, basically, there's a sort of a game of chicken, like how hard

10:09.240 --> 10:14.800
can they do this before, like, they realize that, I mean, they see another 2008,

10:14.880 --> 10:15.400
right?

10:15.560 --> 10:20.680
And if they see another 2008 in the presence of inflation, are they going to

10:20.680 --> 10:24.720
chicken out and just say, you know what, actually, Putin did the inflation, we can

10:24.720 --> 10:28.320
correct the numbers, we'll add a Putin, you know, fudge factor, right, and the real

10:28.320 --> 10:32.120
inflation will be, you know, 1% again, because it's like, Putin is not included.

10:32.360 --> 10:32.640
Right.

10:32.920 --> 10:33.760
There's something like that.

10:33.760 --> 10:34.120
I don't know.

10:34.320 --> 10:39.960
But, but the, like, can they get out, you know, it's a hard problem for the fed

10:39.960 --> 10:44.160
because they have this dictum of like, affecting consumer prices.

10:44.200 --> 10:45.440
It's really, it's just a mess.

10:45.440 --> 10:47.640
The point is, this thing loses money.

10:48.080 --> 10:52.440
And to take something that structurally loses money and say, okay, you're

10:52.440 --> 10:55.240
going to run at break even is really, really hard.

10:55.240 --> 10:55.480
Right.

10:55.680 --> 11:00.920
So you can basically bet that this attempt to raise interest rates is going

11:00.920 --> 11:03.400
to fail and fail reasonably hard.

11:03.480 --> 11:03.760
Okay.

11:04.320 --> 11:04.560
Okay.

11:04.560 --> 11:09.400
So that said, I do have invest investment advice for right now for everyone out

11:09.400 --> 11:15.400
there, you know, there's a current, it's a, it's a, it's, it's, it's the dollar.

11:15.600 --> 11:16.560
It's, it's cash.

11:16.680 --> 11:17.680
I recommend cash.

11:17.800 --> 11:18.240
Interesting.

11:18.240 --> 11:21.320
Even though, even though you just went through how it's, it's, it's

11:21.320 --> 11:24.880
Yeah, I, but, but I, but I don't think we've exactly hit that wall yet.

11:24.960 --> 11:25.320
Right.

11:25.320 --> 11:25.360
Okay.

11:25.360 --> 11:26.000
Fair enough.

11:26.000 --> 11:30.840
And so when things are contracting, you know, basically cash is a great

11:30.840 --> 11:35.080
investment because everything is going to contract relative to cash, including

11:35.080 --> 11:35.600
Bitcoin.

11:35.600 --> 11:39.800
And this basically leads us to the sort of the point of like, what causes these

11:39.800 --> 11:43.960
crypto, you know, winter is Uncle Yarev, you know, and don't they suck?

11:43.960 --> 11:50.040
Yeah, they kind of suck, but they suck because they suck for people who basically

11:50.040 --> 11:50.600
deserve it.

11:50.640 --> 11:55.840
So like, you know, I think one thing that many people have said is it's like the

11:55.840 --> 11:58.960
sort of, you know, the Bitcoin holders and the Bitcoin tourists.

11:58.960 --> 12:01.960
And, you know, when crypto winter comes, the tourists depart.

12:02.240 --> 12:06.400
And what a tourist really is, is someone who's not actually saving in Bitcoin.

12:06.640 --> 12:08.960
For example, he's borrowing dollars to buy Bitcoin.

12:09.360 --> 12:09.840
Right.

12:09.840 --> 12:11.280
That is not saving in Bitcoin.

12:11.280 --> 12:13.080
That is speculating on Bitcoin.

12:13.080 --> 12:18.040
And that makes him basically a weak hand because if Bitcoin goes down, he's

12:18.040 --> 12:19.320
going to get it as margin called.

12:19.600 --> 12:19.960
Okay.

12:20.080 --> 12:22.440
So you're not, so you, you do not save in Bitcoin.

12:23.960 --> 12:28.840
No, saving in Bitcoin is like basically being a naked long Bitcoin.

12:29.320 --> 12:30.560
But a lot of people do that now.

12:30.680 --> 12:31.040
Yes.

12:31.040 --> 12:34.640
A lot of people do that now, but a lot, a lot of other people will do things like,

12:34.960 --> 12:35.880
oh, I'll have Bitcoin.

12:35.880 --> 12:38.000
I'll like lend it to someone for a yield.

12:38.000 --> 12:38.360
Right.

12:38.560 --> 12:42.160
You know, so you have this, have or, you know, have this whole sort of fake

12:42.160 --> 12:48.280
DeFi economy where, you know, just like, wow, I see a lot of lenders, but no borrowers.

12:48.360 --> 12:55.000
Like, and when you see a like financial system with like lenders and no borrowers,

12:55.040 --> 12:57.440
like you're like, oh, I see, right?

12:57.440 --> 12:59.640
You know, and, and, um,

13:01.120 --> 13:07.160
you know, like it's, it's, uh, I mean, you know, that white powder on under your

13:07.160 --> 13:08.520
nose could be salt, right?

13:08.520 --> 13:10.960
You know, but okay.

13:10.960 --> 13:11.240
Okay.

13:11.240 --> 13:15.800
So, so money is the bubble that doesn't pop, right?

13:15.840 --> 13:19.920
Pops, it's a bubble, but it could also not pop and then it could become money.

13:20.080 --> 13:20.360
Right.

13:20.360 --> 13:21.480
It's a contingent outcome.

13:21.480 --> 13:27.000
And so there's a world in which basically, you know, the, um, world's stock

13:27.000 --> 13:29.160
markets sort of turn into more and more of a mess.

13:29.160 --> 13:33.440
For example, they just start like going down permanently the way Japan's

13:33.440 --> 13:37.200
did for 30 years, like the Nikkei peaked in the 1880s.

13:37.520 --> 13:47.080
Um, and so, you know, you have, um, it could be that we hit a recession so hard

13:47.080 --> 13:51.920
and so like more abundant that actually you get to the sort of Japanese level

13:51.920 --> 13:55.400
where even zero entry, you get the zero bound problem as they call it.

13:55.640 --> 14:00.040
You know, which is that you basically, no one wants to borrow because everything

14:00.040 --> 14:04.400
is contracting and, um, then you're like, wow, we could pay people to borrow money

14:04.400 --> 14:06.680
and like crazy shit like that starts happening.

14:06.680 --> 14:13.600
You're really, so the point is that, that there's a lot of, um, there, the scenario

14:13.600 --> 14:21.240
under which the monetization of Bitcoin or possibly a competing currency, uh,

14:21.280 --> 14:27.880
continues is it requires savings to keep flowing in that direction.

14:28.160 --> 14:33.000
And what we see in the crypto, these crypto crashes is that basically all of

14:33.000 --> 14:37.080
the weak hands not only get flushed out, but get like, you know, they will never

14:37.080 --> 14:40.120
sit, you know, it's like Mark Twain said, you know, a cat that sits down

14:40.120 --> 14:42.640
on a hot stove will never sit down on a cold stove again either.

14:42.920 --> 14:43.240
Right.

14:43.240 --> 14:45.880
You know, and, and these people are gone.

14:46.320 --> 14:49.680
Um, but also the price does appreciate over time.

14:50.440 --> 14:54.520
Every cycle, there's a few more hotellers at it who seem sustainable.

14:54.520 --> 14:54.960
Yes.

14:55.120 --> 14:55.520
Yes.

14:55.520 --> 14:59.240
And, and the question, but, but of course, when you look at that, you have

14:59.240 --> 15:05.320
to say, well, you know, is there a limit on the kind of people who would do this?

15:05.560 --> 15:12.680
Can this break out of the libertarian nutcase savings pool can, um, so, you

15:12.680 --> 15:17.720
know, there are many, many credible situations under which, you know,

15:17.720 --> 15:23.520
Bitcoin does not become money after all, you know, of course, you know, for

15:23.520 --> 15:28.920
example, you look at the health of the exchanges out there, uh, that's kind

15:28.920 --> 15:30.600
of a double-edged sword on the one hand.

15:30.600 --> 15:35.360
These are big businesses that can afford to pay protection money to Washington,

15:35.360 --> 15:36.000
which they do.

15:36.240 --> 15:42.440
On the other hand, basically if some agency somewhere passes an order tomorrow

15:43.400 --> 15:49.560
that says banks can't talk to crypto exchanges, think about what happens.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
Basically no one can sell the crypto.

15:53.280 --> 15:53.560
Right.

15:53.560 --> 15:55.160
If you have, there's no price.

15:55.160 --> 15:58.880
And if you have no price, you're worth zero.

15:58.880 --> 16:01.800
And you instantly go to basically the zero equilibrium.

16:01.880 --> 16:03.920
So this is something you've been writing about for many years now.

16:03.920 --> 16:04.840
Since you first started up.

16:04.840 --> 16:09.800
Yeah, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just like, you know, on the one hand in a purely

16:10.000 --> 16:17.080
abstract private sector, you know, um, version of the standardization problem

16:17.080 --> 16:21.240
with like perfect information, with perfect information, everybody realizes

16:21.240 --> 16:23.760
what everyone else should do tomorrow and does it today.

16:24.080 --> 16:26.880
And, you know, it sort of happens instantaneously.

16:27.080 --> 16:27.560
Right.

16:27.600 --> 16:33.960
And, um, so obviously we don't live in the world of perfect information and we

16:33.960 --> 16:35.560
live in a very, very imperfect world.

16:35.560 --> 16:39.080
I was actually, when I realized sort of the game theory, I was like, wow, if I

16:39.120 --> 16:42.840
like post about this, like this could happen like tomorrow, but, uh, you know,

16:42.920 --> 16:45.960
we don't live in the stock market is not a superintelligence.

16:46.440 --> 16:53.000
You know, and, and, and so you actually have this sort of long, complicated.

16:53.440 --> 16:56.200
It's essentially sort of meme warfare, right?

16:56.200 --> 17:01.280
You know, because the only thing that differentiates Bitcoin from

17:01.600 --> 17:06.160
to a random Bitcoin fork, which you can start tomorrow is basically the

17:06.200 --> 17:08.600
memetic weight of being the standard.

17:09.000 --> 17:14.360
And it's like the problem with trying to overthrow that is, you know, let's

17:14.360 --> 17:17.960
say you have Ethereum, which is, um, you know, going to have with proof of

17:17.960 --> 17:22.360
stake, a lower inflation rate, a lower sort of rate of like minor is creating

17:22.360 --> 17:23.840
coins that they have to sell.

17:24.200 --> 17:29.320
So, you know, minor is creating coins that they have to sell to buy electricity.

17:29.680 --> 17:31.720
Is it sort of natural sorts of sellers?

17:32.080 --> 17:36.680
If you don't have a natural, like, you know, a pool of four sellers, you

17:36.680 --> 17:40.040
know, your, uh, your levitation effect will be better.

17:40.040 --> 17:42.800
So maybe that's a case for Ethereum overtaking Bitcoin.

17:43.200 --> 17:45.760
There's a world in which that could, that could certainly happen.

17:45.760 --> 17:53.320
On the other hand, it's like the sort of standardization, like once

17:53.320 --> 17:58.400
that's happened, sort of like the standardization power of the number two

17:58.440 --> 18:02.160
is sort of then even weaker against like the number three and the number four.

18:02.560 --> 18:11.800
And so, you know, and, and, and people who, I don't think there has yet been,

18:13.280 --> 18:20.360
like the market understands that whatever the mysterious cause of the

18:20.360 --> 18:23.800
valuation of these coins, it has something to do with being a store,

18:24.200 --> 18:25.120
store of value.

18:25.560 --> 18:32.040
Um, and what they don't really understand is sort of, it's really hard

18:32.040 --> 18:36.040
to convey the sort of very simple game theory of that, which is just why

18:36.320 --> 18:41.760
think about how much stronger the whole argument would be if simply if Bitcoin

18:41.760 --> 18:44.800
and Ethereum were a single store of value, if they were not competing

18:44.800 --> 18:46.360
for that role, right?

18:46.360 --> 18:50.280
Because the competition makes either of them more unstable because then you

18:50.280 --> 18:55.040
have to accept the probability that one will lose to the other in addition

18:55.040 --> 19:00.160
to the probability that crypto as a whole will fail to dominate the world.
