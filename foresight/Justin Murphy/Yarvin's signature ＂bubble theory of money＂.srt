1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,160
Well, actually the first time I wrote about this was for a little site before my blog

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:17,480
in 2005, and so at the time really I was thinking about the age-old problem of the Austrian

3
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:24,200
theory of money, which is really first elucidated by Karl Manger, which is the question of why

4
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:28,760
certain kinds of goods seem to have anomalous value.

5
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:35,360
Well, of course, often focus on the material utility of the classic, you know, sort of

6
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,640
pre-modern monetary standards of precious metals, and they're like, ooh, it's valuable.

7
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:48,360
But in fact, these goods are grossly overvalued, considering if you analyze them as simply

8
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,960
as commodities, they don't make sense.

9
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:58,240
You see an enormous stock of these commodities, and that stock keeps being accumulated instead

10
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:06,680
of drawn down, and the price is wildly disproportionate to the demand for industrial use of these goods.

11
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:13,920
So there's obviously something sort of interesting going on here, and the simplest way to think

12
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:20,120
about it is that money is essentially a store of value, it's a medium of savings.

13
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:25,320
It's a way that you move purchasing power from the present into the future.

14
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,720
Even in the presence of financial instruments like bonds don't really change the need to

15
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:37,280
physically shift purchasing power from the present to the future, even if you lend money

16
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,080
to be returned in the future, you're lending it to someone who therefore is holding money.

17
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,640
So lending abstractly should not change the demand for money.

18
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,800
So there's always a demand for some such good.

19
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:54,760
And when you look at the sort of game theory of the demand for this good, which is sort

20
00:01:54,800 --> 00:02:03,240
of uses some concepts that the classical Austrians didn't really have at hand, you see that you're

21
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:16,920
basically looking at a coordination problem, because you have to standardize on some store

22
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,560
of value, which is going to be overvalued.

23
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:25,520
And so you have at least one good that has to be overvalued in an economy.

24
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:33,400
But if you have more than one, that's an unstable competition, whereas to have exactly one, and

25
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,160
you know, there can be only one, as they used to say in the movie Highlander, a great, great,

26
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:46,760
great 80s movie, the so the stable state of the system just very, very abstractly is a

27
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,600
state in which there is one dominant money.

28
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:59,160
And so what happens when that standard is created or when standards change, which is a very, you

29
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:05,840
know, sort of cataclysmic financial event, this, of course, is the, you know, the Bitcoin

30
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:12,640
hyper monetization, Bitcoin maximalism, essentially theory, what happens when one of these

31
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:19,160
standards is created is basically people move their savings into this good.

32
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:25,600
And if this good is an appropriate money, appreciating its price will not substantially

33
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:32,240
appreciate its supply, which is obviously very important, and violated a little bit in the

34
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,480
case of the precious metals.

35
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:38,000
I mean, when the gold price goes up, it increases gold mining a little bit, but the amount of

36
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,680
newly mined gold is still quite small compared to the world gold stock.

37
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:52,280
And so what will happen is that basically people will buy this good up in sort of exactly the

38
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:58,400
same way as GameStop stock was bought up last year.

39
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:07,680
And so when something goes up, because everyone is buying in, and not because it has

40
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,200
any intrinsic value or utility, that looks like a bubble.

41
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,560
It's in fact the same thing as a bubble.

42
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:20,080
And so when we look at, you know, sort of a financial bubble, we can see sort of an

43
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,560
attempt to restandardize a money.

44
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:29,800
And that attempt is sort of if the bubble pops, you know, and there are various ways

45
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,880
that certainly Bitcoin could, in theory, pop, if the bubble pops, it looks like this

46
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,200
ridiculous tulip scam all over again.

47
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,720
If it goes to completion, it looks like, you know, you bought into, you know, this incredible

48
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,840
thing, you know, very early.

49
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:56,120
And so, you know, the general cause for sort of an intrinsic demand to restandardize money

50
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:02,120
today is basically monetary dilution.

51
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,960
And when I say monetary dilution, most people will sort of define the stock of

52
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:13,360
money in dollars using very narrow instruments, like M0, M1.

53
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:21,760
I prefer to basically describe the stock of dollars as the total net worth in dollars of

54
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:25,160
all people holding dollars and dollar denominated financial instruments and

55
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,200
financed assets.

56
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:32,520
And that's essentially defining the dollar supply as the sum of personal net worth,

57
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,400
which is a statistic, I don't know how accurate it is.

58
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,480
It's a statistic that, you know, the Fed keeps.

59
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:45,160
And so when you see personal net worth, I think in like 2021, it may have gone up by

60
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,040
or 2020 to 21, it was going up by 20 trillion dollars a year.

61
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:56,960
This is obviously not the stuff that we have is getting 20 trillion dollars more valuable.

62
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,720
You know, maybe we have wine and the wine is aging.

63
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,080
I don't think that's how it's working.

64
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:12,560
It's basically a sort of this way of creating dollars broadly stated when the stock

65
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,600
market goes up, everyone feels good.

66
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,560
It is no different from printing money and sending it primarily to rich people.

67
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,360
And so what you're doing, you know, you're actually running this very cynical

68
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,840
economy that's doing two things.

69
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:29,320
One is that it's running on the basis of printing money and sending it to rich people.

70
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:35,320
Another way to see that is that the economy is actually losing 20 trillion dollars a year

71
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,960
because those are liabilities.

72
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,320
Your stock, you know, when the stock market goes up, you're creating liabilities.

73
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,360
Equity is a liability on a balance sheet.

74
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,040
And so, you know, when basically the total financed value of this financial asset is

75
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:53,640
increasing, what you're seeing is that basically 20 trillion dollars got created out

76
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,760
of thin air, basically 20 trillion dollars got borrowed out of thin air because those

77
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,640
companies now have to justify, in theory, those valuations.

78
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:08,080
So in practice, you know, you're looking at this very strange system where if you set

79
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,360
interest rates to basically zero, which is a very strange thing to do, not least because

80
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:19,560
the valuation of financial assets tends to use equations in which the interest rate is

81
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,120
a denominator.

82
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:26,640
And so we sort of have with all of the like, wee, free money for everyone.

83
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:32,240
Everyone's 401k went up, you know, experience of, you know, not just the last two years,

84
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:38,440
but, you know, before this latest, but more like the last, you know, I mean, since

85
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:44,800
Allen Greenspan, right, you're basically watching the sort of huge red ink factory and

86
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:51,120
you're seeing a nation that is basically living pretty much on debt, like a very rich

87
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,200
person who's so rich that he can just keep borrowing.

88
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:59,720
And so, you know, that sort of experience of a nation living on debt sort of does a

89
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,480
couple of things.

90
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:04,920
That's obviously very destructive to the real economy, not that there is much of a

91
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:11,760
real economy left, but, you know, it does a lot of damage to the real economy, but

92
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:18,720
also from a financial perspective, it causes all assets to basically you have to, you

93
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,480
know, move, you can't just hold cash.

94
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:24,880
You have to move your money around in such a way that it benefits from this, you know,

95
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,280
beneficent force.

96
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:32,680
And so it basically makes everything want to get out of cold dollars into things like,

97
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,800
you know, index funds, you know, we have this interesting concept of passive investing,

98
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,080
which is in total defiance of all economic theory, you know, the reason you invest is

99
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:46,800
that you're adding value to the market, right, or you're lending, but like passive

100
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:51,360
investing is like, you know, we, I have an index funded, it magically goes up.

101
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,680
And everyone can somehow make a profit off of that.

102
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:53,960
Right, right, right.

103
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:58,160
And so basically, like, you know, but the one thing money doesn't want to be is just

104
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,760
playing cold dollars, because just playing cold dollars don't participate in this, except

105
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:08,000
in the event of the expansion motor turns off when the whole thing begins to rapidly

106
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,320
collapse as, you know, it's done a bit of this year.

107
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,320
And then you really want to be holding cold, cold, hard cash, which brings us perhaps to

108
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,720
another topic, which is a competitor money.

109
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,720
Yes, exactly.

110
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:26,240
And so, and so, you know, the ability to, you know, just the fact of the dollar

111
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:33,160
supply inflating inflates the potential demand, assuming even just assuming sort of constant

112
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,360
influx for this other money.

113
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,720
And so basically, what you're seeing is you're seeing that the whole dollar system,

114
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,120
when it's expanding like this, and it needs to expand because the economy is losing

115
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,840
money, you need to like, to generate consumer spending, you need to be printing new

116
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,440
money by giving it to boomers and their retirement accounts.

117
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,160
Right.

118
00:09:52,160 --> 00:10:00,360
And so, you know, if this system, like, I mean, like, it can't like what you're

119
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,480
seeing right now, for example, with the fed raising interest rates and creating a

120
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:09,240
recession, it's like, basically, there's a sort of a game of chicken, like how hard

121
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:14,800
can they do this before, like, they realize that, I mean, they see another 2008,

122
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,400
right?

123
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:20,680
And if they see another 2008 in the presence of inflation, are they going to

124
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:24,720
chicken out and just say, you know what, actually, Putin did the inflation, we can

125
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,320
correct the numbers, we'll add a Putin, you know, fudge factor, right, and the real

126
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,120
inflation will be, you know, 1% again, because it's like, Putin is not included.

127
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:32,640
Right.

128
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,760
There's something like that.

129
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,120
I don't know.

130
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,960
But, but the, like, can they get out, you know, it's a hard problem for the fed

131
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:44,160
because they have this dictum of like, affecting consumer prices.

132
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,440
It's really, it's just a mess.

133
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,640
The point is, this thing loses money.

134
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:52,440
And to take something that structurally loses money and say, okay, you're

135
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,240
going to run at break even is really, really hard.

136
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:55,480
Right.

137
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,920
So you can basically bet that this attempt to raise interest rates is going

138
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,400
to fail and fail reasonably hard.

139
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:03,760
Okay.

140
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:04,560
Okay.

141
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:09,400
So that said, I do have invest investment advice for right now for everyone out

142
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:15,400
there, you know, there's a current, it's a, it's a, it's, it's, it's the dollar.

143
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,560
It's, it's cash.

144
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,680
I recommend cash.

145
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,240
Interesting.

146
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,320
Even though, even though you just went through how it's, it's, it's

147
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,880
Yeah, I, but, but I, but I don't think we've exactly hit that wall yet.

148
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,320
Right.

149
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:25,360
Okay.

150
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,000
Fair enough.

151
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,840
And so when things are contracting, you know, basically cash is a great

152
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:35,080
investment because everything is going to contract relative to cash, including

153
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,600
Bitcoin.

154
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,800
And this basically leads us to the sort of the point of like, what causes these

155
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,960
crypto, you know, winter is Uncle Yarev, you know, and don't they suck?

156
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:50,040
Yeah, they kind of suck, but they suck because they suck for people who basically

157
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:50,600
deserve it.

158
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:55,840
So like, you know, I think one thing that many people have said is it's like the

159
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,960
sort of, you know, the Bitcoin holders and the Bitcoin tourists.

160
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,960
And, you know, when crypto winter comes, the tourists depart.

161
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,400
And what a tourist really is, is someone who's not actually saving in Bitcoin.

162
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,960
For example, he's borrowing dollars to buy Bitcoin.

163
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:09,840
Right.

164
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,280
That is not saving in Bitcoin.

165
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,080
That is speculating on Bitcoin.

166
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:18,040
And that makes him basically a weak hand because if Bitcoin goes down, he's

167
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,320
going to get it as margin called.

168
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:19,960
Okay.

169
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,440
So you're not, so you, you do not save in Bitcoin.

170
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:28,840
No, saving in Bitcoin is like basically being a naked long Bitcoin.

171
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,560
But a lot of people do that now.

172
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,040
Yes.

173
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,640
A lot of people do that now, but a lot, a lot of other people will do things like,

174
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,880
oh, I'll have Bitcoin.

175
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,000
I'll like lend it to someone for a yield.

176
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,360
Right.

177
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,160
You know, so you have this, have or, you know, have this whole sort of fake

178
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:48,280
DeFi economy where, you know, just like, wow, I see a lot of lenders, but no borrowers.

179
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:55,000
Like, and when you see a like financial system with like lenders and no borrowers,

180
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,440
like you're like, oh, I see, right?

181
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,640
You know, and, and, um,

182
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:07,160
you know, like it's, it's, uh, I mean, you know, that white powder on under your

183
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,520
nose could be salt, right?

184
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,960
You know, but okay.

185
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,240
Okay.

186
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,800
So, so money is the bubble that doesn't pop, right?

187
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:19,920
Pops, it's a bubble, but it could also not pop and then it could become money.

188
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:20,360
Right.

189
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,480
It's a contingent outcome.

190
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:27,000
And so there's a world in which basically, you know, the, um, world's stock

191
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,160
markets sort of turn into more and more of a mess.

192
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:33,440
For example, they just start like going down permanently the way Japan's

193
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,200
did for 30 years, like the Nikkei peaked in the 1880s.

194
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:47,080
Um, and so, you know, you have, um, it could be that we hit a recession so hard

195
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:51,920
and so like more abundant that actually you get to the sort of Japanese level

196
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,400
where even zero entry, you get the zero bound problem as they call it.

197
00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:00,040
You know, which is that you basically, no one wants to borrow because everything

198
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:04,400
is contracting and, um, then you're like, wow, we could pay people to borrow money

199
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,680
and like crazy shit like that starts happening.

200
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:13,600
You're really, so the point is that, that there's a lot of, um, there, the scenario

201
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:21,240
under which the monetization of Bitcoin or possibly a competing currency, uh,

202
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:27,880
continues is it requires savings to keep flowing in that direction.

203
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:33,000
And what we see in the crypto, these crypto crashes is that basically all of

204
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,080
the weak hands not only get flushed out, but get like, you know, they will never

205
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,120
sit, you know, it's like Mark Twain said, you know, a cat that sits down

206
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,640
on a hot stove will never sit down on a cold stove again either.

207
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,240
Right.

208
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,880
You know, and, and these people are gone.

209
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,680
Um, but also the price does appreciate over time.

210
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:54,520
Every cycle, there's a few more hotellers at it who seem sustainable.

211
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:54,960
Yes.

212
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:55,520
Yes.

213
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:59,240
And, and the question, but, but of course, when you look at that, you have

214
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:05,320
to say, well, you know, is there a limit on the kind of people who would do this?

215
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:12,680
Can this break out of the libertarian nutcase savings pool can, um, so, you

216
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:17,720
know, there are many, many credible situations under which, you know,

217
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:23,520
Bitcoin does not become money after all, you know, of course, you know, for

218
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:28,920
example, you look at the health of the exchanges out there, uh, that's kind

219
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,600
of a double-edged sword on the one hand.

220
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:35,360
These are big businesses that can afford to pay protection money to Washington,

221
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,000
which they do.

222
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:42,440
On the other hand, basically if some agency somewhere passes an order tomorrow

223
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:49,560
that says banks can't talk to crypto exchanges, think about what happens.

224
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Basically no one can sell the crypto.

225
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:53,560
Right.

226
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,160
If you have, there's no price.

227
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,880
And if you have no price, you're worth zero.

228
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,800
And you instantly go to basically the zero equilibrium.

229
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,920
So this is something you've been writing about for many years now.

230
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,840
Since you first started up.

231
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:09,800
Yeah, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just like, you know, on the one hand in a purely

232
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:17,080
abstract private sector, you know, um, version of the standardization problem

233
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:21,240
with like perfect information, with perfect information, everybody realizes

234
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,760
what everyone else should do tomorrow and does it today.

235
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,880
And, you know, it sort of happens instantaneously.

236
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:27,560
Right.

237
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:33,960
And, um, so obviously we don't live in the world of perfect information and we

238
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,560
live in a very, very imperfect world.

239
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:39,080
I was actually, when I realized sort of the game theory, I was like, wow, if I

240
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,840
like post about this, like this could happen like tomorrow, but, uh, you know,

241
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,960
we don't live in the stock market is not a superintelligence.

242
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:53,000
You know, and, and, and so you actually have this sort of long, complicated.

243
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,200
It's essentially sort of meme warfare, right?

244
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:01,280
You know, because the only thing that differentiates Bitcoin from

245
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,160
to a random Bitcoin fork, which you can start tomorrow is basically the

246
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,600
memetic weight of being the standard.

247
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,360
And it's like the problem with trying to overthrow that is, you know, let's

248
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,960
say you have Ethereum, which is, um, you know, going to have with proof of

249
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:22,360
stake, a lower inflation rate, a lower sort of rate of like minor is creating

250
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,840
coins that they have to sell.

251
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:29,320
So, you know, minor is creating coins that they have to sell to buy electricity.

252
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,720
Is it sort of natural sorts of sellers?

253
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,680
If you don't have a natural, like, you know, a pool of four sellers, you

254
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:40,040
know, your, uh, your levitation effect will be better.

255
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,800
So maybe that's a case for Ethereum overtaking Bitcoin.

256
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,760
There's a world in which that could, that could certainly happen.

257
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:53,320
On the other hand, it's like the sort of standardization, like once

258
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:58,400
that's happened, sort of like the standardization power of the number two

259
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,160
is sort of then even weaker against like the number three and the number four.

260
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:11,800
And so, you know, and, and, and people who, I don't think there has yet been,

261
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:20,360
like the market understands that whatever the mysterious cause of the

262
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,800
valuation of these coins, it has something to do with being a store,

263
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,120
store of value.

264
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:32,040
Um, and what they don't really understand is sort of, it's really hard

265
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:36,040
to convey the sort of very simple game theory of that, which is just why

266
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:41,760
think about how much stronger the whole argument would be if simply if Bitcoin

267
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,800
and Ethereum were a single store of value, if they were not competing

268
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,360
for that role, right?

269
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:50,280
Because the competition makes either of them more unstable because then you

270
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:55,040
have to accept the probability that one will lose to the other in addition

271
00:18:55,040 --> 00:19:00,160
to the probability that crypto as a whole will fail to dominate the world.
