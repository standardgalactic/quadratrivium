WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:23.000
All right, everybody. Thank you so much for coming out. This is a really interesting, unique event.

00:24.000 --> 00:31.000
There are people here who have flown here from different states. There's like more than five people who flew here just for this.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.000
Wow.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
And it's not just, thank you, man. I appreciate that.

00:35.000 --> 00:42.000
Of course, that's flattering, but thanks, man. We might need that about one hour in.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.000
And you know, that's very flattering and all, but I'm not crazy. No one's flying several hours because of me.

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
I mean, I'm pretty fucking smart and cool, but I'm not that smart and cool.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
But you're sweet, Justin. You're very sweet.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
Well, thank you, Curtis.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
I appreciate that.

00:57.000 --> 01:12.000
The reason I'm commenting on this before we even begin is because people really need to understand that there is an extraordinary demand out there for true, radical, dangerous, intellectual thought and expression and discussion.

01:12.000 --> 01:21.000
And there is an unfortunately constrained supply. There's an artificially constrained supply of true intellectual life.

01:21.000 --> 01:27.000
And people should not have to fly hundreds of miles to come listen to someone like Curtis Talk.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
There is a huge demand for it. It's not being met.

01:31.000 --> 01:36.000
And if, unfortunately, the way things are working out right now is if you want this kind of thing, you have to make it yourself.

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
DIY, baby. Punk rock culture, dude. Get a venue where you live.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
Put on things like this. You know, the institutions aren't going to do it for you.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Academics aren't going to do it for you.

01:46.000 --> 01:59.000
Almost everyone out there right now who is kind of representing some sort of intellectual posture, let's be honest, about 90, at least 90% of them are utterly fake, absolute, absolute fakers.

01:59.000 --> 02:04.000
And if you want real intellectual life, no one's going to give it to you necessarily.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
But if you build it, they will come.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
Look at this. I'm not that famous, people.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
Like, I'm really not. I do not have that big of a following.

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
And yet I do this little event and people will fly across states.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
So my exhortation, I want to start essentially with an exhortation.

02:17.000 --> 02:23.000
If you think this is cool, if you enjoy this talk, if you were excited to come to this and if it lives up even halfway to what you wanted it to be,

02:23.000 --> 02:30.000
the type of intellectual kind of community or dialogue, the exciting kind of dangerous, edgy intellectual experience that you want it to be,

02:30.000 --> 02:36.000
which I think Curtis and I are both committed to making it that for you, then go home and do it yourselves.

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
Provide this for the other people around you. People should not have to fly this far just to be a part of this.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
So that's just a little exhortation.

02:42.000 --> 02:47.000
Fortunately, you're watching this on YouTube in porn mode.

02:47.000 --> 02:53.000
You can hit record now. We're going to start. We're good? You sure? Okay, cool.

02:53.000 --> 02:58.000
So, okay, that's my little exhortation because people should not have to fly this far to be a part of something like this.

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
Welcome to this little event that we've put on. This is my first live show of my podcast.

03:03.000 --> 03:09.000
The podcast is called Other Life, and it's pretty much all about me trying to find true intellectual life wherever it exists.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
Today, that mostly means on the Internet.

03:11.000 --> 03:21.000
So most of the people I interview for my podcast are bloggers, kind of strange, interesting, unique, idiosyncratic, and very courageous people, typically.

03:21.000 --> 03:29.000
We're just weird people who are out there pursuing some type of independent intellectual life that is escaping this kind of institutional apparatus

03:29.000 --> 03:34.000
that is so constraining so many people nowadays. That's what my podcast is all about.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
That's why it's called Other Life. It's about a different kind of life.

03:37.000 --> 03:43.000
I started it when I was an academic, and I needed to find people to actually talk about interesting, real stuff with.

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
So that's my podcast, Other Life, and this is the first time I'm doing a live show.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
So, yeah, this is a milestone for me, and I'm very happy to have you all here.

03:51.000 --> 04:00.000
Enough on general introductions. I would like to now introduce our special guest here tonight, Curtis Jarvin, a.k.a. Menchist Moldbug.

04:00.000 --> 04:07.000
And I'm going to pick his brain about many things. I have some questions that were actually submitted to me by other people.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
Fuck.

04:10.000 --> 04:15.000
But Curtis has told me anything goes. He's told me, you know, there's nothing off limits.

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
Luckily, I'm a fairly friendly interviewer. I don't have any hard balls for you to plan.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
I'll be thinking that now.

04:21.000 --> 04:26.000
So, I'll give you a little bit of introduction. Most of you are here, you probably already know.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
Curtis is shtick, but what I think is most...

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Good word.

04:31.000 --> 04:37.000
Come on in, guys. What I think is most, you know, Curtis is mostly known for being a reactionary blogger,

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
and of course, a brilliant startup founder.

04:40.000 --> 04:45.000
But in these circles, you're probably kind of most known for being a rather reactionary blogger.

04:45.000 --> 04:50.000
What I think is kind of most interesting about you, Curtis, is not primarily your reactionary qualities,

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
which are interesting for sure, and we'll get there.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
But primarily, you're a computer scientist or an engineer.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
What would you say, engineer, or what's the label you would use?

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
I like to think of myself as a computer programmer.

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
Computer programmer. There you go. Old school. I like the modesty.

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
And so, I tend to see your writings mostly through that lens.

05:10.000 --> 05:16.000
I see you as your blog, which we're going to kind of dissect over the next hour or two.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
Shit.

05:19.000 --> 05:24.000
To me, the defining characteristic of your worldview and your political theory is not so much your reactionary qualities,

05:24.000 --> 05:30.000
but I see your reactionary qualities as kind of downstream of your engineer mentality

05:30.000 --> 05:35.000
or your computer programming type of mentality and experience.

05:35.000 --> 05:42.000
I see you as, Curtis likes to, I think, kind of hack into the source code of a lot of conventional wisdom,

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
in particular, kind of the politically correct wisdom.

05:45.000 --> 05:51.000
And then once he's kind of hacked into your source code, he wants to bring you places that maybe you don't necessarily want to go,

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
but he wants to kind of lure you there.

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
Yeah, that's a fairly insightful comment, Justin.

05:57.000 --> 06:02.000
I would say something a little close to that, which is just that I like to think from first principles.

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
And so, when I see a large system or a complicated system, I'm like,

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
okay, what would this look like if you designed it from scratch?

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
Clearly, this is a product of history.

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
It's spent a lot of time evolving.

06:16.000 --> 06:21.000
As I record, there's a lot of Americans concerned about the 401Ks.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
And so, I'm like, what is this stock market thing?

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
Where did this come from?

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
How does this work?

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
This is a very interesting kind of question to me.

06:28.000 --> 06:33.000
And I think that approach can be used by a lot of people for a lot of different things.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
Excellent.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
So, my intuition there is not wrong.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
Mostly.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
Okay.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
So, I think that's enough of an introduction.

06:41.000 --> 06:48.000
He's a computer programmer, a well-known blogger, and a founder of an enigmatic startup called Herbit,

06:48.000 --> 06:53.000
which we might have some time to get into a little bit, too, now that you've formally walked away from Herbit.

06:53.000 --> 06:57.000
I think, are you now a little bit more free to discuss it, or?

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
Yeah.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
I mean, I'm a little bit more free, but I'm also more distant from it.

07:01.000 --> 07:06.000
So, what I say should not be taken as gospel.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
Anyone can read my resignation letter.

07:09.000 --> 07:16.000
And I'm using the enough sort of unusually for Silicon Valley, everything I wrote in that is true.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
Cool.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
Great.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
Then, I don't think you need much more of a warm-up.

07:20.000 --> 07:25.000
I think we can get right into the interesting stuff that people are probably here to hear you talk about.

07:25.000 --> 07:30.000
I see you as very interested in, well, you're kind of a pill dispenser, aren't you?

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
Yeah, sort of.

07:31.000 --> 07:37.000
You like dispensing pills, whether they be red pills or most recently, clear pill is a recent idea you have.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Yeah.

07:38.000 --> 07:44.000
I have questions about that as a marketing concept, but I'm pretty sincere about it.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
Right.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
I take that as sincere.

07:46.000 --> 07:51.000
In fact, to my understanding, you actually popularized the term red pill in the political context.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
Is that right?

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
Yeah, that's actually true.

07:53.000 --> 08:00.000
I can tell you actually where I was when I came up with that, which is in the Haydashbury at Hayden Masonic.

08:00.000 --> 08:10.000
I was in the People's Cafe, and the People's Cafe is the decor in the People's Cafe is entirely like 60s revolutionary stickers.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
So, you know, it's a very kind of positive place.

08:13.000 --> 08:21.000
And, you know, to those who have seen the Matrix, obviously, you know, it's obvious that, you know, the red pill is this kind of left-wing, you know, analogy.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
You know, what if you made it a right-wing one? Wouldn't that be interesting?

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
Right.

08:26.000 --> 08:33.000
So what I thought would be a good exercise to kick things off is maybe you could dispense a kind of pill right now.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
And I was thinking, I was thinking a really...

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Can you be more specific?

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
Yeah.

08:37.000 --> 08:41.000
I was thinking a really good place to start would be on the concept of democracy.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
Oh, sure.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
Okay.

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
You know, let's talk about democracy for a second.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
You know, I actually have a nice little line prepared on that.

08:50.000 --> 08:56.000
Which is, you know, people are very fond on Twitter and so forth of these political quadrants.

08:56.000 --> 09:05.000
And one way you can draw a political quadrant is to say, you can ask two questions, you know, is your country a democracy?

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
And should it be a democracy?

09:07.000 --> 09:16.000
So the set of people who answer no to both of those questions, that's a relatively small set.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
And it's a pretty freaking weird set.

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
So, yeah, I'm kind of part of that set.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
So that's my perspective.

09:23.000 --> 09:34.000
The reason I wanted to start with democracy as a good test case is because it's arguably one of the most universally applauded concepts or values right now in kind of mainstream culture, right?

09:34.000 --> 09:40.000
Well, I was going to stop you before you said, you know, right now, actually, it's pretty much universally reviled.

09:40.000 --> 09:47.000
But it's only universally reviled if you consider all historical periods as equal.

09:47.000 --> 09:51.000
Right, for most of the history of the term, it was a bad thing.

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
Yeah, because people, you know, saw, you know, the history of Athens and so forth.

09:55.000 --> 10:02.000
And, you know, the history of Athens basically is an independent principality basically ends with democracy.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
And, you know, the history of the Roman Republic ends in a very turbulent way.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Right.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
And so, you know, who's it?

10:08.000 --> 10:14.000
You know, John Adams, you know, the greatest American political philosopher, of course, second president.

10:14.000 --> 10:19.000
I'm trying to recall his words on democracy verbatim.

10:19.000 --> 10:23.000
But, you know, he's like, you know, this is the worst political system ever.

10:23.000 --> 10:34.000
And this is one of the founders of, you know, like the main philosopher of, you know, the main person who's kind of political writing still holds up from the American founding.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
Yes, that's right.

10:35.000 --> 10:40.000
I mean, for most of the history of the term democracy, it essentially means what we now think of as something like anarchy.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
They're just kind of seen as synonymous with chaos, something to be avoided.

10:43.000 --> 10:49.000
Or if you're familiar with the word populism, used as a pejorative.

10:49.000 --> 10:58.000
You know, so one simple example that I sometimes use is, let's take two words, politics and democracy.

10:58.000 --> 11:07.000
So you'll notice that when you think about those words, you have very different associations with either.

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
So suppose you were to say, oh, we're going to politicize this.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
We're going to politicize U.S. foreign policy.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
We're going to politicize the State Department.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
We're going to politicize the coronavirus.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
That's clearly a very bad thing to do.

11:19.000 --> 11:24.000
But if you're going to democratize this, you know, if you're going to bring democracy to China or whatever,

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
wasn't there that great Guns N' Roses album, Chinese Democracy?

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
Can you buy that in China?

11:28.000 --> 11:36.000
You know, I sometimes wonder, oh, man, so, you know, if you're going to democratize something, you know, there's absolutely no question

11:36.000 --> 11:41.000
that democracy has a completely positive set of associations.

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
And politics, you know, like office politics is bad.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
You know, anything political is bad.

11:47.000 --> 11:52.000
And yet you look at these two words and you're like, wait, they're synonyms.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
But one of them is good and one of them is bad.

11:54.000 --> 12:01.000
You know, and if you can explain that, you know, basically, I don't think you have any need for any of my pills.

12:01.000 --> 12:07.000
It's almost like in your grand narrative, democracy is sort of the root of all problems in some sense.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
Oh, that would be going too far.

12:09.000 --> 12:17.000
I mean, you know, democracy is a very legitimate, it's one of the many, like one of the three basic political systems.

12:17.000 --> 12:23.000
And, you know, as a political system, even more, it's basically a form of political energy.

12:23.000 --> 12:27.000
You know, even in a country like you're in the Soviet Union, there's no real democracy.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Maybe there are fake elections.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
But you can say, does democratic power still exist?

12:32.000 --> 12:37.000
Of course it does, because it's what overthrew or what helped overthrow the Soviet Union.

12:37.000 --> 12:42.000
So, you know, this basic force never, at least abstractly, disappears.

12:42.000 --> 12:48.000
And no one, certainly no one has refuted the categorization of Aristotle into three political systems.

12:48.000 --> 12:54.000
Democracy, rule of the many, oligarchy, rule of the few, and monarchy, rule of the one.

12:54.000 --> 13:00.000
Real quick, not to digress too much, but when was the last time you did a public talk, IRL?

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
2012.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
2012, without being cancelled.

13:04.000 --> 13:10.000
Oh, without being cancelled. Well, I did a, no, I mean, I did, I've done technical talks like once or twice.

13:10.000 --> 13:15.000
But, yeah, I've never, you know, I don't usually do public appearances, so I'm kind of a virgin here.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
Okay, interesting.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
Okay.

13:18.000 --> 13:22.000
You'll have to excuse me if I feel, seem a little nervous and weird.

13:22.000 --> 13:29.000
No, no, you seem great. I was only asking because I'm kind of, I'm thinking a lot lately about kind of the shifting tides of the culture wars.

13:29.000 --> 13:34.000
It seems to me that something like this would maybe not have even been possible a year ago.

13:34.000 --> 13:39.000
The protest energy might have been too great, threats of having it shut down or whatever the case might be.

13:39.000 --> 13:46.000
Whereas now I have this kind of sense that, personally, that we're kind of turning a corner, where this type of thing is now more possible.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
I was just curious if you have any similar type of intuition.

13:48.000 --> 14:01.000
Well, you know, that may be true in a sense. You know, the one thing that I try really hard to do that has been sort of the perennial kind of, if I may use the term, shit show.

14:01.000 --> 14:14.000
The last three years is that I feel like a lot of people, when they create, you know, heterodox content, you know, the word, do you know the origin of the word trolling, by the way?

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
Not sure that I do.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
Let me tell you the origin of the word trolling, then I'll tell you why I don't troll.

14:18.000 --> 14:24.000
The origin of the word trolling, first of all, if you've ever, has anyone ever trolled, you know, in fishing?

14:24.000 --> 14:29.000
Any fishermen in the room? I can see, okay, yeah, that's good.

14:29.000 --> 14:34.000
Yeah, you have slowly from the back of the boat, you're dragging basically this lure, right?

14:34.000 --> 14:39.000
I have trolled, I have fished for bass, you know, it's lower class to fish for bass, which is why I like it.

14:39.000 --> 14:45.000
And, you know, like, people of quality fish for trout, and they certainly don't troll.

14:45.000 --> 14:52.000
Nonetheless, the word trolling, as we use it now, was actually a product of the Vietnam War.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
Did you notice?

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
I did not.

14:54.000 --> 15:08.000
So what it was invented, you know, with a clear analogy to the fishing practice, basically US, what were called wild weasels, which were like an F-104, I think, outfitted with some kind of electronic intercept category,

15:08.000 --> 15:21.000
basically fly across surface to air missile sites in North Vietnam, trying to get surface to air missiles shot at them, so they could basically lock onto the launchers and destroy them with counter missiles.

15:21.000 --> 15:26.000
So anytime you're thinking of the word trolling, you should be like, where are my radar seeking missiles?

15:26.000 --> 15:32.000
And if you're just like out there basically trying to attract fire, you're just, you should really question why you're doing this.

15:32.000 --> 15:36.000
And of course that question could be asked about the whole Vietnam War, right?

15:36.000 --> 15:50.000
And so, you know, when people basically go, you know, there were like, if you remember in like an early 2017, there were like these, like, provocations in Berkeley, like these Antifa Breitbart riots, you know, it seems like something from like the 15th century now.

15:50.000 --> 15:58.000
You know, the whole thing, you know, was really quite, it was very larpy, if you know the term, it was very kind of pretend.

15:58.000 --> 16:11.000
And the thing that I dislike about it most, and the one thing that I would basically caution all heterodox thinkers about is that the one thing you really don't want to do is inhabit the stereotypes of your opponents.

16:11.000 --> 16:19.000
So basically, you have, you know, anyone who's kind of, you know, working in some direction has people working against them, right?

16:19.000 --> 16:24.000
And those people who are working against you see you as a certain kind of person.

16:24.000 --> 16:28.000
They imagine, oh, this is what our enemies are like.

16:28.000 --> 16:44.000
And because their frame is so dominant, it's really easy to inhabit that caricature, because basically you've been taught by them, oh, this is what, you know, our enemies are like, they believe this, they believe that, they do this, they do that.

16:44.000 --> 16:55.000
And if you basically get that so deeply into your head that you're like, you know, oh, I oppose you, I do this, I do that, you don't really have your own frame, you're still operating in their frame.

16:55.000 --> 17:02.000
And you're operating in a way which is much more valuable to them than if you even supported them.

17:02.000 --> 17:09.000
So was this type of strategy behind your blog, Unqualified Reservations, were you thinking about these things proactively when you first set out to do that blog?

17:09.000 --> 17:14.000
No, it was crazy. I should never have written anything at all.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
Do you mean that? You don't mean that.

17:17.000 --> 17:26.000
There's part of me that means that, but there's part of me that doesn't. You know, when I think about the problem of being a dissident, I'm always reminded.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
Do you know the writer, Rizard Kapozynski?

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
I don't.

17:29.000 --> 17:33.000
He was, he wrote mainly in the 80s and 90s, I think he died in the early 2000s.

17:33.000 --> 17:39.000
He was a journalist and he was a correspondent for the official Polish Communist News Agency.

17:39.000 --> 17:45.000
And fortunately for him, he was also an amazing writer and he got sent to Africa.

17:45.000 --> 17:50.000
So Africa is kind of relatively tangentially related to Polish communism.

17:50.000 --> 17:57.000
So he could not really exactly write whatever he wanted, but he could be pretty, he could write stuff that was actually worthwhile content.

17:57.000 --> 18:03.000
There's some controversy over whether there's any actual truth in his books or whether they're just wholly made up.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
But even if they're wholly made up, they're pretty good.

18:06.000 --> 18:11.000
And so he wrote this, but one book called The Emperor, which is about Ethiopia.

18:11.000 --> 18:16.000
And so he went to Ethiopia and everyone's here has heard of Haile Selassie, right?

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
You know, like from like Bob Marley songs or something.

18:18.000 --> 18:22.000
So Haile Selassie was this emperor of Ethiopia and he was kind of a nutcase.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
He had pet lions, he used to feed descendants to the lions.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
It was a little weird.

18:27.000 --> 18:39.000
And so eventually it was sort of weird enough and what we now call civil society, you know, got started to kind of organize against him and, you know, he was overthrown.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
The same thing happens, it always happens.

18:41.000 --> 18:49.000
He was overthrown by the liberals and then the liberals got stabbed in the back by the committed Marxist Leninists and they established this regime called the Derg,

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
which was about 100 times worse than Haile Selassie ever was.

18:52.000 --> 19:04.000
But so in the early days of the Derg, Richard Kapasinski, this Polish journalist, goes to Ethiopia and he interviews all kinds of people who are basically part of the old regime.

19:05.000 --> 19:13.000
Ethiopia, you know, as you may or may not know, is in some ways more of a Middle Eastern country than an African country.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
And it has this, it's a Christian country.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
It has this very old nobility and this very old elite.

19:17.000 --> 19:23.000
And so these people were, you know, the former employees of Haile Selassie.

19:23.000 --> 19:33.000
So there's this one interview from this book or maybe completely fake interview, I don't really know, that sticks in my mind where he goes and interviews a couple who are part of this old regime.

19:34.000 --> 19:43.000
That's government service class who have basically had a son who has become a dissident and subsequently comes to, of course, a very bad end.

19:43.000 --> 19:50.000
And he's interviewing this couple and he's like, you know, tell me when you first suspected that there might be a problem.

19:50.000 --> 19:58.000
And, you know, the wife was like, well, you know, one day my husband came to me and he was like, we have a problem.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
What is the problem?

19:59.000 --> 20:04.000
The problem is Tesfaye, their son, Tesfaye has started to think.

20:04.000 --> 20:25.000
And as a parent, I really relate to that, you know, and, you know, in a way like, you know, the, you know, anyone who is interested in actually getting ahead or succeeding in this world would be very well advised not to think.

20:25.000 --> 20:30.000
And if they start thinking they should, you know, and I'm serious about this, they should keep it to themselves.

20:30.000 --> 20:35.000
You know, they should hide, you know, there's a great term hide your power level, hide your power level.

20:35.000 --> 20:44.000
By all means, you know, if you start thinking, don't be like a 15 year old Ethiopian boy who's going to end up being shot in a month and a half.

20:45.000 --> 20:52.000
And so, you know, that's, I think, certainly, you know, is a valid perspective.

20:52.000 --> 21:02.000
You know, on the other hand, you know, you know, what was this line of Shaw, you know, a reasonable person adapts himself to society.

21:02.000 --> 21:06.000
An unreasonable person insists on adapting the world to himself.

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
Therefore, all progress depends on unreasonable people.

21:10.000 --> 21:14.000
And what about people who are cursed with this drive or this necessity to think?

21:14.000 --> 21:20.000
Well, you know, there's a great line. There's another writer I really adore, which is the writer Freda Utley.

21:20.000 --> 21:26.000
So she was writing in the 30s and 40s and she was a communist.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
She was a communist in the 30s.

21:28.000 --> 21:32.000
In the 30s, basically anyone who was smart or cool was a communist.

21:32.000 --> 21:36.000
The list of smart, cool people who were not communists is an interesting list.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
Otherwise, they were communists.

21:38.000 --> 21:51.000
And so, Ellie was a communist and she was so committed to the cause that she went and married a Russian, you know, a bright young Russian guy who was, you know, part of the revolution and actually moves to Russia with him.

21:51.000 --> 21:59.000
And she moves to Russia with him and then in, like, their mid-30s, then shit goes bad.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
He disappears into the gulag. She never hears from him again.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
And she has, like, a baby son.

22:05.000 --> 22:12.000
So she comes back to the U.S. and she has all these chic friends, right?

22:12.000 --> 22:15.000
Because communism has always been this very, very chic movement.

22:15.000 --> 22:19.000
And she's like, friends, help me.

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
Like, because the Soviet Union really cares.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
I bet it's friends, bro. Sorry.

22:24.000 --> 22:30.000
And, you know, of course, her friends are just like, do I know you?

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
Do I know this person? Who is this anti-Soviet person who's knocking on my door?

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
They're like, fuck you.

22:36.000 --> 22:41.000
And so, you know, of course, she gets nowhere with this, right?

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
Sorry.

22:42.000 --> 22:48.000
And, you know, she goes and talks to her friend, Edith Hamilton.

22:48.000 --> 22:53.000
You know, Edith Hamilton, the great writer and mythology, great 30s writer.

22:53.000 --> 22:58.000
She talks to Edith Hamilton and she's like, why are all my friends like stabbing me in the back?

23:00.000 --> 23:08.000
And Edith Hamilton is like, well, you know, you really shouldn't expect the material rewards of success

23:08.000 --> 23:13.000
to come along with the spiritual rewards of telling the truth.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
You shouldn't expect that.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
And I think that's true today.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
And you've experienced that, right, Justin?

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
I'll let you talk for a sec.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
Yeah, sure.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
So you're...

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
I mean, you know, I think it's possible.

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
You know, one thing you didn't do, Justin, was introduce yourself.

23:26.000 --> 23:32.000
And I think it's possible that there may be some people watching who might know who I am, but don't know who you are.

23:32.000 --> 23:36.000
I wouldn't be so presumptuous to introduce myself.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
I mean, you can if you want.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
All right.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
Well, you know, unfortunately, I don't know that much about you.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
But what I know is...

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
Let me just say what I know about Mr. Murphy.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
I can if you want.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
No, I'll tell you what I know.

23:48.000 --> 23:51.000
So, you know, Justin Murphy is a...

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
I would describe him as a defrocked academic.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
Is that right?

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
I take issue with that.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
They couldn't fire me because I quit, baby.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
Yeah, yeah, it sounds right.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
I was about to be defrocked, yes.

24:06.000 --> 24:11.000
But I'm a proud Irish Catholic man, and I just didn't want to give him that pleasure.

24:11.000 --> 24:16.000
Many people advised me, actually, to let them fire me, let them go through with the...

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
I would have advised you that.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
The big stink.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
I believe you did.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
I believe you emailed me, actually.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
I called the email to you, actually.

24:22.000 --> 24:26.000
Yeah, so I thought long and hard about it, but I decided, ultimately,

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
and this is the only thing that's actually interesting about my case.

24:29.000 --> 24:33.000
It's not me, per se, but what I do think is interesting about my particular case

24:33.000 --> 24:37.000
is my phenomenology of going through this conflict,

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
my kind of cost-benefit calculus at the time.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
I was a professor for six years, a successful professor.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
I'm a political scientist by training.

24:43.000 --> 24:46.000
I was based in England at the University of Southampton.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
And I was doing very well.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
Everything was going pretty much according to plan.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
Are you still a Red Brick University?

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
Yes, that's right, as a matter of fact.

24:54.000 --> 25:01.000
And pretty much I bought into this myth that I was always kind of conducting my life on,

25:01.000 --> 25:05.000
which was that if I play by the rules in academia and I publish in good journals

25:05.000 --> 25:09.000
and I climb the ranks and I establish myself and prove myself and get tenure,

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
I had the British version of tenure, I was set.

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
Then, finally, there would come a time when I could speak freely,

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
where I could really do what I want and I could be free.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
My advisors, that's what my PhD advisors always told me.

25:18.000 --> 25:22.000
That's what I thought from the day that I set out to pursue an academic career.

25:22.000 --> 25:26.000
And I guess I was the only person stupid enough to actually take that promise, literally.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
I mean, I'm not kidding.

25:27.000 --> 25:31.000
Once I really got arrived, I got the British version of tenure,

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
I had good publications in top journals.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
I literally said to myself pretty consciously,

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
okay, now I'm going to start being free.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
I started the podcast.

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
I'm like, I'm going to actually start blogging about whatever I want.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
I'm going to start talking about whatever I want.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
I'm going to really let the chips fall where they may,

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
because this whole academic game is only worth it.

25:47.000 --> 25:52.000
But paying all of those dues over 10 years or more was only worth it to get that freedom.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
That's what I was in it for.

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
So I decided to take it and immediately I started getting flack.

25:56.000 --> 26:01.000
It was very clear, very apparent that that type of freedom was never going to come.

26:01.000 --> 26:06.000
And at the same time, the academic institutions were getting more and more oppressive,

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
more and more annoying, the amounts of paperwork you have to do,

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
the amounts of red tape, the political correctness.

26:11.000 --> 26:14.000
All of the costs of being an academic were increasing.

26:14.000 --> 26:18.000
At the same time that all of my creative, independent, intellectual work on the internet

26:18.000 --> 26:21.000
was gaining more and more traction and it was more and more fun.

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
And the ability to do that freely and independently on the internet

26:24.000 --> 26:28.000
seemed to be increasing at the same time that my academic career seemed more and more miserable.

26:28.000 --> 26:32.000
So that was when, you know, at that time I'm realizing all of this,

26:32.000 --> 26:36.000
you know, when my administrator comes to me and says that I'm not allowed to use the word retard on Twitter,

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
I was like, fuck you, I'm going to say whatever I want on Twitter.

26:38.000 --> 26:41.000
And yeah, it was clear that push was going to come to shove.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
They probably would have pushed me out.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
But honestly, I just didn't want to deal with the hassle.

26:45.000 --> 26:49.000
And I genuinely decided that I had better prospects as, you know,

26:49.000 --> 26:54.000
an independent intellectual pursuing a full-time intellectual career for the rest of my life.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Because I'm still young. I still have piss and vinegar.

26:56.000 --> 26:59.000
I was like, I can carve out a new path. I can make a new model.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
I think I see it possible.

27:01.000 --> 27:04.000
So I was like, peace out. And I decided to do my own thing.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
I didn't need them to fire me or whatever.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
That's my little intro about me. Yeah, sure.

27:08.000 --> 27:15.000
So kind of my theory, you know, I dropped out of grad school in computer science for somewhat different,

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
but certainly not political reasons.

27:17.000 --> 27:22.000
But, you know, I think I came to the same realization as Justin,

27:22.000 --> 27:29.000
but somewhat sooner than Justin that, you know,

27:29.000 --> 27:34.000
essentially here was this form and this kind of form of science.

27:34.000 --> 27:37.000
And, you know, I come into this and I'm like, I take it at face value.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
I'm like, this is what it appears to be.

27:39.000 --> 27:45.000
And then you get in there and you basically discover that you're actually training to be a bureaucrat.

27:45.000 --> 27:49.000
And my parents were bureaucrats, so I kind of know the experience pretty well.

27:49.000 --> 27:54.000
And I'm like, I'm actually, what I'm trying to do here is make alliances.

27:54.000 --> 27:59.000
What I'm trying to do here is make friends who will scratch my back when they scratch theirs.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
I'm trying to be popular.

28:01.000 --> 28:04.000
I'm trying to be on a team player.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
I'm trying to be with the program.

28:06.000 --> 28:10.000
You know, and I'm like, you know, this is like, you know, was, I'm sorry to be arrogant,

28:10.000 --> 28:13.000
but was Isaac Newton a team player?

28:13.000 --> 28:18.000
Isaac Newton was a weirdo and a nerd and like just an impossible person to deal with.

28:18.000 --> 28:27.000
And like science, the kinds of people who created, you know, the science and academia and literature that we know

28:27.000 --> 28:32.000
could never have succeeded in these institutions and cannot succeed in these institutions.

28:32.000 --> 28:37.000
And unless they have just these amazing talents and I've seen people who can do that,

28:37.000 --> 28:42.000
you know, I wouldn't try like political science as crazy, but like computer science, sure.

28:42.000 --> 28:46.000
There are people who are amazing computer scientists in a very fundamental sense

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
and also amazing bureaucrats.

28:48.000 --> 28:51.000
And those people are very successful and they deserve all the success they get.

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
But they're an exception.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
Yeah, definitely.

28:56.000 --> 29:03.000
So I want to talk about unqualified reservations, your notorious blog that you wrote in the late 2000s.

29:03.000 --> 29:09.000
You seem to have some misgivings about ever having gained any type of recognition or readership for your blog.

29:09.000 --> 29:12.000
You seem to have mixed emotions. I'm kind of curious about that.

29:12.000 --> 29:20.000
Well, you know, it's always very difficult when you have to, I hesitate to say careers, I have zero careers,

29:20.000 --> 29:28.000
but the two very different directions you're pursuing because they can easily interfere with each other.

29:28.000 --> 29:33.000
It's like one of my favorite, you know, historical figures or artists generally.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
Do you know Wyndham Lewis?

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
Of course.

29:35.000 --> 29:42.000
You know, and so Wyndham Lewis is both, you know, a very, you know, not just a legitimate, really a leading literary figure

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
and also a leading figure in painting.

29:45.000 --> 29:51.000
And, you know, his paintings and his literary work are both, all of his writing actually needs editing,

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
but otherwise it's very good.

29:53.000 --> 29:58.000
And so, you know, but those careers didn't really interfere with each other.

29:58.000 --> 30:03.000
You know, there's another kind of thing that people will do where they make a career in some technical field

30:03.000 --> 30:07.000
and then make a shit ton of money, you know, which hasn't actually happened to me.

30:07.000 --> 30:15.000
And then, you know, quit and go and be, you know, some kind of intellectual, philosophical, literary figure or whatever,

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
but doing the reverse is very, very difficult.

30:17.000 --> 30:21.000
Was the blog in your mind when you set out to write it, was it just for fun,

30:21.000 --> 30:27.000
or would you say you had intellectual ambitions to really kind of solve some puzzles around political theory?

30:27.000 --> 30:32.000
I would say that I had, you know, certainly intellectual ambitions, but, you know,

30:32.000 --> 30:37.000
I have no, well, of course I have no political ambitions,

30:37.000 --> 30:43.000
but I also, you know, I was just not really that interested in who would read my blog.

30:43.000 --> 30:47.000
In fact, I never even read the comments, which was probably a mistake.

30:47.000 --> 30:54.000
And the, you know, I absolutely hate reading about myself in any context whatsoever.

30:54.000 --> 30:58.000
And like many neurotic writers.

30:58.000 --> 31:06.000
But I was just like, you know, in a way that was, that era was kind of the last gasp of the old Internet way of doing things,

31:06.000 --> 31:12.000
where you basically, you know, it's like I started posting on like Usenet in like 1989, right?

31:12.000 --> 31:15.000
So, you know, that was, that was some time ago.

31:15.000 --> 31:20.000
And, you know, in that world, like the Internet was this weird thing that no one had heard of.

31:20.000 --> 31:28.000
And, you know, and like my own project, Urban Today, with which I'm no longer associated.

31:28.000 --> 31:38.000
And having being something that no one had heard of provided, it just provided this really nice intellectual quality,

31:38.000 --> 31:41.000
because, you know, there was, you could not imagine it mattering.

31:41.000 --> 31:45.000
I mean, I remember the first time that I saw the Internet mentioned in the New York Times.

31:45.000 --> 31:48.000
It may have been the first time the Internet was mentioned in the New York Times.

31:48.000 --> 31:53.000
It was the fall of 1988, and Robert Morris had unleashed the famous Morris Worm.

31:53.000 --> 31:57.000
And so you're reading, you're reading New York Times, and then you read about the Internet in New York Times.

31:57.000 --> 32:00.000
It's like your cousin was in the New York Times, right?

32:00.000 --> 32:09.000
You write a lot about this, actually, how you're very specifically resigned from any type of, trying to have political efficacy of any kind.

32:09.000 --> 32:12.000
You write about this throughout unqualified reservations.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
You say this frequently.

32:14.000 --> 32:23.000
And do you think that that's actually a kind of necessary precondition for pursuing a real kind of long-term original creative intellectual project in some sense?

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
Absolutely.

32:25.000 --> 32:30.000
You know, and let me, in a way, turn that question back on you.

32:30.000 --> 32:35.000
I would say that, you know, you can't really be free.

32:35.000 --> 32:38.000
Can I get all Buddhist on you?

32:38.000 --> 32:39.000
What's that?

32:39.000 --> 32:40.000
Can I get all Buddhist on you?

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
Yeah, go for it, man.

32:41.000 --> 32:45.000
You can't really be free until you free yourself from desire, man.

32:45.000 --> 33:01.000
And so the, and to free yourself from, you know, one of my big things, if, you know, those of you who've read my latest series, The Clear Pill, featured in the Claremont Institute's American Mind,

33:01.000 --> 33:06.000
people have been, my editors have been yammering at me for part three for about four months.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
I'm working on it.

33:09.000 --> 33:22.000
And so, you know, one of the things that I really tend to focus on is this word, themos, which is a Greek word that can be translated in a number of ways.

33:22.000 --> 33:26.000
I think the simplest translation is ambition.

33:26.000 --> 33:34.000
But, you know, in Plato, you see this explicit parallel between themos and eros, eros being, of course, sexual desire.

33:34.000 --> 33:42.000
And so desire for power and desire for sex have always been, you know, very, very closely related, especially if you're Harvey Weinstein.

33:42.000 --> 33:53.000
And these are like, you know, these were always, you know, now, of course, we, you know, the received wisdom has never turned down money, sex, or power.

33:53.000 --> 33:57.000
But, you know, before the modern world, that was actually considered kind of decadent.

33:57.000 --> 34:03.000
And the willingness to sort of resist desire, that's not just a Buddhist thing, right?

34:03.000 --> 34:16.000
And so, you know, when I look at, say, Justin's experience in academia, I would say that he expected to academia to be one thing, but he found it another.

34:16.000 --> 34:24.000
And the way in which he found it another was he expected it to be something that was not corrupted by power, but in fact it was corrupted by power.

34:24.000 --> 34:39.000
And so, in a way, the academic systems, even of a, Redbrick University, like the University of Southampton, these academic systems, I'm sorry, I'm just being derogatory for no reason at all.

34:39.000 --> 34:47.000
And these academic systems evolved in a world where they were, the relevance was very low.

34:47.000 --> 34:57.000
I mean, even, you know, the first, of course, we had this, America had this amazing experience where they elected Woodrow Wilson, who was a professor of political science, president.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
I'm sure that can never happen again.

34:59.000 --> 35:11.000
But, you know, before then, if you look at, like, America in 1900, the idea that professors would tell the government what to do, as you probably know, being a political scientist, was like, it was weird.

35:11.000 --> 35:16.000
It would be like hairdressers suddenly took control of Washington, right, you know, and everything was about hair.

35:16.000 --> 35:23.000
And suddenly, of course, you know, academics have a much better claim to rule than hairdressers.

35:23.000 --> 35:26.000
No offense to any hairdressers out there.

35:26.000 --> 35:40.000
But what happened, you know, what led to this sort of kind of way of living that we have now is that you had these, you know, people like the political science professors of 100 years ago.

35:41.000 --> 35:46.000
You know, you know, I don't know if you've read any, you know, Charles Francis Adams, Jr.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
Not much, but at least I know the name.

35:48.000 --> 35:57.000
You know, I recommend anyone read his 1900 American Historical Association address on history, if you're interested in history.

35:57.000 --> 36:06.000
And he was basically like, look, you know, politics is, you know, conducted on this incredibly crude level.

36:07.000 --> 36:12.000
And you have, you know, when you look at what people are thinking about when they vote, they just have no idea what's going on.

36:12.000 --> 36:15.000
It's this incredibly long essay that was delivered as an address.

36:15.000 --> 36:21.000
He goes through every presidential election between like 1856 and like 1900.

36:21.000 --> 36:24.000
And he's just like, in this election, the voters had no clue.

36:24.000 --> 36:27.000
In that election, we can see that the voters had no clue.

36:27.000 --> 36:30.000
Finally, this election, they had no idea what they were doing.

36:30.000 --> 36:35.000
And, you know, he goes through basically both sides of each election were just out of touch with reality.

36:35.000 --> 36:41.000
And so, you know, this is kind of the anti-democracy of very early progressivism.

36:41.000 --> 36:46.000
And so he's like, okay, you know, here's the ship that is not being steered.

36:46.000 --> 36:49.000
It's like a ship without a pilot or a ship with a drunken pilot.

36:49.000 --> 36:52.000
Who is capable of steering the ship?

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
And of course, the answer is very clear.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
Now, Charles Francis Adams, Jr.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
I mentioned John Adams, you know, earlier.

36:57.000 --> 37:01.000
Charles Francis Adams, Jr. is actually the great-grandson of John Adams.

37:01.000 --> 37:05.000
So, you know, he's a, you know, this is as blue as American blood comes.

37:05.000 --> 37:10.000
And so, in a way, here's this kind of rising academic aristocracy that says,

37:10.000 --> 37:13.000
wow, here is a ship with no pilot or a drunken pilot.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
Someone should take control of it.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
Someone competent.

37:16.000 --> 37:20.000
Someone who just knows what they're doing, who can actually think.

37:20.000 --> 37:24.000
This seemed like a great idea at the time.

37:24.000 --> 37:29.000
And what people didn't realize is that basically, you know,

37:29.000 --> 37:33.000
this is kind of the great lesson of Tolkien that somehow has really been missed,

37:33.000 --> 37:38.000
is that basically, when you put on the ring, you become something different.

37:38.000 --> 37:41.000
It's like, you know, my son, who's nine, he just read Lord of the Rings.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
And I'm like, you know, he actually asked me.

37:43.000 --> 37:46.000
He's like, why doesn't Gandalf just put on the ring and fucking kick ass?

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
He didn't put it quite that way.

37:48.000 --> 37:52.000
And I'm like, well, you know, that question is never really answered in the book.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
And actually, the book never really tells you.

37:54.000 --> 37:57.000
It's like, you know, like Bilbo puts on the ring.

37:57.000 --> 38:01.000
Bilbo's magical power of like a, you know, he has no magical powers at all.

38:01.000 --> 38:02.000
So it just makes him invisible.

38:02.000 --> 38:06.000
But for Gandalf, he could like turn a mountain into a swamp, right?

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
But he would be corrupted by that power.

38:08.000 --> 38:14.000
And so in a way, like, you know, in a world where someone like Justin could just be a scholar

38:14.000 --> 38:19.000
and just be like, oh, you know, I'm interested in some issue of political science.

38:19.000 --> 38:22.000
You know, and it didn't matter.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
That would be very easy.

38:24.000 --> 38:29.000
But in a world where it does matter, what you're going to find is that it matters.

38:29.000 --> 38:34.000
And that's going to attract people like your dean or whatever who are going to be like,

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
this guy is not a team player.

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
This guy is not with the program.

38:37.000 --> 38:42.000
But do you think that because so much intellectual activity or supposedly intellectual activity today

38:42.000 --> 38:49.000
is colonized by this kind of power hungry institutionalized kind of corruption.

38:49.000 --> 38:55.000
Is it not in some sense a great moment for true intellectuals who want to just turn to their blog

38:55.000 --> 38:59.000
or write books for truly radically disinterested truth seeking purposes?

38:59.000 --> 39:03.000
Is now is not now perhaps one of the greatest times to be doing that precisely

39:03.000 --> 39:07.000
because so much of what passes for intellectual activity has nothing to do with intellectual activity.

39:07.000 --> 39:10.000
Well, you know, it's a great moment, but it's not an easy moment.

39:10.000 --> 39:15.000
You know, you know, let me tell you about the time I was detained in the New Zealand airport.

39:15.000 --> 39:23.000
Or let me not, but the, you know, of course, as I said, you know, with Fred earlier, you know,

39:23.000 --> 39:26.000
if it's easy, you're not, you're wasting time, right?

39:26.000 --> 39:33.000
But, you know, it's certainly not easy, but, you know, it's an interesting, you know, promising time.

39:33.000 --> 39:40.000
You know, it's like, you know, in answer this question, I had a little, I really don't know Justin at all.

39:40.000 --> 39:46.000
I don't trust him, but I had an email exchange with him where I was like, you know,

39:46.000 --> 39:50.000
clearly what he's doing down here is pretty interesting and pretty cool.

39:50.000 --> 39:54.000
And, you know, when I look at all of you in the audience, I say that you're pretty cool people.

39:54.000 --> 40:01.000
I'm also older than about all of you, you know, which is interesting and always a good sign, actually.

40:01.000 --> 40:06.000
And so, you know, I was like, Justin, I think this is still available,

40:06.000 --> 40:12.000
but, you know, anyone who wants to, is interested in doing the same thing can go on YouTube.

40:12.000 --> 40:16.000
And there's an old PBS documentary about David Geffen.

40:16.000 --> 40:20.000
So people in the room probably know who David Geffen was, right?

40:20.000 --> 40:28.000
So basically, David Geffen, you know, I think he has a boat the size of the USS Nimitz or something.

40:28.000 --> 40:31.000
You know, David Geffen has done very well for himself,

40:31.000 --> 40:36.000
and, you know, he hasn't done well by, you know, being a parent.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
Well, maybe a little bit of a parasite.

40:38.000 --> 40:42.000
But what David Geffen did in this PBS documentary is very informative,

40:42.000 --> 40:45.000
is he basically figured out how to sell the hippies.

40:45.000 --> 40:50.000
And his procedure in selling the hippies was, I'm going to become a hippie.

40:50.000 --> 40:56.000
I'm going to move into a hippie house, hang out with other hippies, listen to their hippie music.

40:56.000 --> 41:01.000
And when I listen to their hippie music, I'll be like, hmm, these people are good.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
These people, not so much.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
You know, hippie music had varied a lot, right?

41:05.000 --> 41:10.000
And then he's like, I'm going to take the good people and I'm going to stamp them on wax.

41:10.000 --> 41:14.000
And I'm going to sell them to the American people who, it's 1967 or whatever,

41:14.000 --> 41:19.000
believe that, like, Satan has come back to the earth in Southern California.

41:19.000 --> 41:24.000
And, you know, of course, in the shape of Manson, Satan does come back,

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
which is kind of part of the problem.

41:26.000 --> 41:32.000
But I'm going to sell this to, like, all of America, and I'm going to get incredibly rich.

41:32.000 --> 41:39.000
And so, you know, and of course, you know, even the stuff he recorded is,

41:39.000 --> 41:42.000
some of it has lasted as art, some of it has not lasted.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
But, you know, he was seriously trying.

41:44.000 --> 41:50.000
Like, he was actually trying to, you know, hear something amazing that's happening.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
Maybe he was a bit of a hippie himself, I don't know.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
But he certainly did drugs with them.

41:54.000 --> 42:01.000
But, I think, but, you know, to sort of bring that into the modern world,

42:01.000 --> 42:07.000
there was a piece I read in The New York Times about six months ago or so,

42:07.000 --> 42:13.000
maybe six months a year or something, and it was about the YouTube rabbit hole of radicalization.

42:13.000 --> 42:16.000
You've probably heard about the YouTube rabbit hole of radicalization.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
They're working hard on that one, folks.

42:18.000 --> 42:23.000
And, you know, I wouldn't be surprised, just because I mentioned this,

42:23.000 --> 42:26.000
you know, like, I've doubled your chances of getting demonetized.

42:26.000 --> 42:29.000
But it was a good story.

42:29.000 --> 42:32.000
It was really well reported, a really solid story.

42:32.000 --> 42:39.000
And the, but there was this sort of interesting moment where they interviewed this YouTube engineer

42:39.000 --> 42:46.000
who, or, like, had a comment from this engineer who'd done this kind of internal engagement study on YouTube.

42:46.000 --> 42:51.000
And he was like, well, you know, we don't usually think of this as a vertical.

42:51.000 --> 42:55.000
But if you did think of it as a vertical, I'm sure, you know, for his query purposes,

42:55.000 --> 42:59.000
he's defining this just incredibly, ultimately broadly, right?

42:59.000 --> 43:02.000
But he's like, if you did think of it as a vertical,

43:02.000 --> 43:06.000
then basically, if you looked at our top four verticals,

43:06.000 --> 43:15.000
it would be like gaming and, you know, music and sports and the alt-right.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
And that's what the article said.

43:18.000 --> 43:21.000
Now, you know, I mean, obviously, I'm reading this in New York Times.

43:21.000 --> 43:25.000
So, you know, we have to discount this a little bit.

43:25.000 --> 43:30.000
But the thing is, and this is sort of both the problem and the paradox in a way,

43:30.000 --> 43:35.000
is that there's this sort of enormous demand for heterodox content out there.

43:35.000 --> 43:39.000
And what's missing is basically David Geffen to come and say,

43:39.000 --> 43:44.000
this is the good heterodox content, this other stuff is just crap.

43:44.000 --> 43:47.000
So you really do get my project then.

43:47.000 --> 43:48.000
I appreciate that.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
Maybe I invented it first.

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
But yeah, no, I think that is your...

43:52.000 --> 43:56.000
Well, the thing is, you know, one of the things is, like,

43:56.000 --> 44:01.000
when you're looking at anything that's like true or makes sense,

44:01.000 --> 44:05.000
what you'll see is that a lot of people invent it at the same time.

44:05.000 --> 44:08.000
And, you know, it's only people like you who execute, you know,

44:08.000 --> 44:12.000
rather than me who sits in my room and just scribbles,

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
who actually gets things done.

44:14.000 --> 44:18.000
I mean, you know, like, and so it's great that you create your own content,

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
but you may have more of a role as a David Geffen.

44:20.000 --> 44:21.000
Interesting.

44:21.000 --> 44:22.000
Interesting.

44:22.000 --> 44:23.000
Gone.

44:23.000 --> 44:28.000
But yeah, that's in a sense the level of opportunity.

44:28.000 --> 44:31.000
And what's missing is, like, when you think about...

44:31.000 --> 44:34.000
I think when most people think about, you know,

44:34.000 --> 44:38.000
there's sort of many meanings of this, you know, strange term alt-right, right?

44:38.000 --> 44:41.000
What it meant in 2015 is not what it means now.

44:41.000 --> 44:44.000
As you're well aware, there are plenty of people in the world

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
with the power to change the meaning of a word,

44:46.000 --> 44:49.000
not individuals but systems.

44:49.000 --> 44:53.000
And so in a way that word has changed, you know, you might say now,

44:53.000 --> 44:56.000
if you're casting the broadest possible net, you know,

44:56.000 --> 44:59.000
dissident right, you know, deep right, you know,

44:59.000 --> 45:02.000
I tried to make this catch on, but totally failed.

45:02.000 --> 45:05.000
You know, people only, you know, if you're coining things,

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
like, almost everything will fail.

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
And you just got to bear that in mind.

45:09.000 --> 45:15.000
And so in a way, you know, when you look at the breadth of that set,

45:15.000 --> 45:23.000
what's really missing there is a really just savage quality filter,

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
like a really ruthless quality filter.

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
And that's not even going to be a filter.

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
And the one thing I do think...

45:29.000 --> 45:32.000
Well, Justin gets many things, but one thing I do think Justin gets

45:32.000 --> 45:35.000
is that that filter, when most people think about that filter,

45:35.000 --> 45:38.000
they're like, they're still thinking these very conventional terms,

45:38.000 --> 45:41.000
so they're just like, oh, you know, well, the moderate side of this is okay,

45:41.000 --> 45:44.000
but then there are these people who go too far.

45:44.000 --> 45:50.000
And I wouldn't say, like, thinking about it in those terms is very unproductive,

45:50.000 --> 45:53.000
but there are certainly many, it's very, very easy.

45:53.000 --> 45:56.000
There are many ways to just simply be wrong,

45:56.000 --> 45:59.000
and you're just never going to win by being wrong.

45:59.000 --> 46:04.000
I'm curious, what kind of traffic was unqualified reservations getting at its peak?

46:04.000 --> 46:05.000
I never looked.

46:05.000 --> 46:06.000
You never looked?

46:06.000 --> 46:07.000
No.

46:07.000 --> 46:08.000
Really?

46:08.000 --> 46:09.000
No.

46:09.000 --> 46:10.000
I never looked.

46:10.000 --> 46:11.000
Okay.

46:11.000 --> 46:12.000
Interesting.

46:12.000 --> 46:16.000
If you were writing unqualified reservations today from scratch,

46:16.000 --> 46:19.000
let's say you were at the same age that you were writing unqualified reservations,

46:19.000 --> 46:22.000
but it's today, would you do anything differently?

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
Yeah, I'd probably do everything differently.

46:24.000 --> 46:28.000
I mean, for one thing, well, for one thing, the age of the blog is gone.

46:28.000 --> 46:31.000
So, you know, a couple of things have changed about the internet.

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
The age of the blog is gone.

46:34.000 --> 46:35.000
It's dead.

46:35.000 --> 46:36.000
It's over.

46:36.000 --> 46:37.000
It's done.

46:37.000 --> 46:38.000
You can't bring it back.

46:38.000 --> 46:39.000
It's very sad.

46:39.000 --> 46:42.000
The age in which the internet was sort of something special

46:42.000 --> 46:45.000
that not everyone was on is completely dead.

46:45.000 --> 46:48.000
You know, basically, in Usenet in, you know, 1991,

46:48.000 --> 46:53.000
even you sort of relied on the just the abstruseness of this medium

46:53.000 --> 46:57.000
to provide, you know, this kind of passive gatekeeping function,

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
which is the same kind of function.

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
Anyone here been to Burning Man?

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
Probably maybe one or two people.

47:03.000 --> 47:06.000
It's the same kind of gatekeeping function that being out in the desert

47:06.000 --> 47:09.000
provides to Burning Man, and it just provides this awesome experience

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
of being with people who are your people.

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
And that's why people go to Burning Man.

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
It's not because they like the fucking desert.

47:15.000 --> 47:18.000
And, you know, if you could actually have Burning Man,

47:18.000 --> 47:21.000
well, I mean, the first Burning Man's were on the beach, right?

47:21.000 --> 47:24.000
You know, in like Santa Cruz or something.

47:24.000 --> 47:27.000
And then it started getting too popular,

47:27.000 --> 47:31.000
so that's what happened to, you know, to Usenet.

47:31.000 --> 47:35.000
So basically, when people were writing blogs in like,

47:35.000 --> 47:38.000
I started writing, I started my blog in 2007.

47:38.000 --> 47:41.000
Even, and that was very late, and I always used this very old,

47:41.000 --> 47:44.000
old-fashioned, ugly-looking blogger template,

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
which was even more embarrassing.

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
Of course, there were no ads on blogs now.

47:48.000 --> 47:51.000
I'm always embarrassed when I open someone's WordPress,

47:51.000 --> 47:54.000
and I see like the ads that they're earning like six bucks a month off of.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
You know, I'm just like embarrassed for you

47:56.000 --> 47:59.000
that you have to like present your content this way, you know,

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
and you don't even have to.

48:01.000 --> 48:05.000
And so, you know, furthermore, so the idea of there sort of being

48:05.000 --> 48:10.000
these decentralized sort of pieces of the Internet,

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
that's not the real Internet anymore.

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
That's not what the Internet is.

48:14.000 --> 48:15.000
That should be reality.

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
That should be what the next network is.

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
But that's certainly not what the Internet is.

48:19.000 --> 48:23.000
And so that's dead.

48:23.000 --> 48:27.000
Another thing that's dead is when you look at these big, you know,

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
these hosting services like Blogger,

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
which was once an independent company,

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
but then was acquired by Google, of course.

48:33.000 --> 48:37.000
You basically, when you first started using these centralized Internet services,

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
the way you thought about it was basically,

48:39.000 --> 48:44.000
this was just kind of a more convenient way of implementing the decentralized Internet.

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
The ethos was still decentralized.

48:46.000 --> 48:49.000
And so the idea that you would publish a blog on Blogger,

48:49.000 --> 48:52.000
and then you would get like an email from like some Google staffer

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
being like, oh, you can't write this essay,

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
or like your Gmail account would disappear

48:56.000 --> 48:59.000
because you said the wrong thing in your blog,

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
that was unthinkable.

49:01.000 --> 49:05.000
Like that, you could not imagine that happening in 2008.

49:05.000 --> 49:10.000
And maybe in a sense, maybe you had an intuitive sense that that era was ending,

49:10.000 --> 49:13.000
but it's certainly long since it disappeared.

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
Okay. Yeah, that's interesting.

49:15.000 --> 49:18.000
One of the things people often ask me is,

49:18.000 --> 49:21.000
Justin, you know, why are you so interested in people like Curtis Jarvan or Nick Land?

49:21.000 --> 49:24.000
Why are you interested in these kind of extreme right-wingers?

49:24.000 --> 49:28.000
And they often take this as evidence that I am therefore an extreme right-winger,

49:28.000 --> 49:29.000
which I'm not.

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
Justin, are you going to hire for us tonight?

49:31.000 --> 49:34.000
No, I wouldn't count on that.

49:34.000 --> 49:39.000
And what I tell people often is that people on the left

49:39.000 --> 49:43.000
should be really interested in smart people on the right,

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
even the extreme right, who are smart

49:45.000 --> 49:50.000
and who are able to correctly and adequately

49:50.000 --> 49:56.000
kind of push away the dumbest, most violent and nasty aspects of the right.

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
So someone like you, for instance,

49:58.000 --> 50:02.000
you're very explicit about having very little interest in white nationalism, for instance.

50:02.000 --> 50:05.000
Yeah, I keep meaning to actually go on Nazi podcasts and argue with them.

50:05.000 --> 50:10.000
I may actually do this, you know, and like, because these people are just,

50:10.000 --> 50:13.000
I don't want to be arrogant, but I think they're just defenseless against me.

50:13.000 --> 50:17.000
And it's not like, you know, the way, the right way,

50:17.000 --> 50:21.000
whether you're arguing with a Nazi or a progressive or anything in between,

50:21.000 --> 50:24.000
you know, no, they're very different.

50:24.000 --> 50:27.000
You know, whether you're arguing with any of those,

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
you know, it should never be an argument.

50:29.000 --> 50:33.000
You're not arguing, do not ever have political arguments as very bad,

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
an unproductive thing to do.

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
It should not be an argument, it should not be a fight.

50:37.000 --> 50:40.000
What you're doing, whenever you talk to someone who doesn't share your beliefs,

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
is in fact an intervention.

50:42.000 --> 50:45.000
And so you're basically thinking of this person as an addict,

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
and he's addicted to the wrong drug.

50:48.000 --> 50:51.000
He needs to give that drug up and start taking your drug.

50:51.000 --> 50:54.000
I told you he was a pill dispenser.

50:54.000 --> 50:57.000
But, you know, that's okay because the first step, your honor,

50:57.000 --> 51:00.000
I mean, sure, I'll say, I have something that's actually good for you

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
that will make you feel amazing, but, you know,

51:02.000 --> 51:05.000
your first step is to get off this junk you're taking, right?

51:05.000 --> 51:09.000
And so, you know, basically, you know, at one point,

51:09.000 --> 51:12.000
in my, you know, vein attempt to coin terms,

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
I came up with the term of brown scare,

51:14.000 --> 51:17.000
which is like the red scare but our fear of Nazis.

51:17.000 --> 51:20.000
You know, there's this like Nazi hunters billboard just down the street from us.

51:20.000 --> 51:23.000
Imagine if it was like the 50s and it was like commie hunters.

51:23.000 --> 51:26.000
They actually made this great movie called I Married a Communist.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
It's absolutely worth seeing.

51:28.000 --> 51:31.000
Hollywood, like, had to be, like, had its arm twisted

51:31.000 --> 51:34.000
in order to make this anti-communist movie.

51:34.000 --> 51:38.000
But, you know, brown scare didn't really take off

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
because simply people are ignorant today

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
and didn't know the brown is the color of Nazis,

51:42.000 --> 51:46.000
but the, which is, I mean, that's just terrible.

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
Like, you have, like, you're obsessed with Nazis

51:48.000 --> 51:51.000
and you don't know anything about Nazis, you know?

51:51.000 --> 51:55.000
You know, the Nazi party headquarters was the brown house, right?

51:55.000 --> 51:59.000
And so, you know, basically what happened, you know,

51:59.000 --> 52:02.000
I came up with this, you know, I've admitted it, I guess,

52:02.000 --> 52:05.000
so I came up with this stupid fucking meme, the red pill, right?

52:05.000 --> 52:08.000
Or I stole it from the Wachowskis, rather.

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
And I really just robbed them.

52:10.000 --> 52:17.000
And imagine how much they must hate hearing that shit, right?

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
You know?

52:19.000 --> 52:22.000
Dear Wachowsky siblings, if you're watching right now,

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
I'm sorry it was not right.

52:24.000 --> 52:30.000
And so, basically, you know, I had this idea

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
and I filled this, you know, pill with all these, like,

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
exotic ingredients in my pill.

52:34.000 --> 52:38.000
It cost, like, you know, $500 or it was at least 5,000 words.

52:38.000 --> 52:42.000
You know, it was a very high quality product and still is.

52:42.000 --> 52:45.000
And then, of course, you know, what happens to high quality products

52:45.000 --> 52:48.000
when you put them on Amazon, they get pirated.

52:48.000 --> 52:53.000
And so, basically, you know, I mean, it's fairly easy to determine

52:53.000 --> 52:56.000
that I was the first that was using this stupid meme,

52:56.000 --> 53:00.000
but, you know, there's a kind of puzzle that you don't really,

53:00.000 --> 53:03.000
can't really understand otherwise about this red pill thing,

53:03.000 --> 53:08.000
but it kind of seems to simultaneously appear among pickup artists

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
and Nazis.

53:10.000 --> 53:13.000
And then, you know, so the question you have to ask yourself is,

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
who is copying who?

53:15.000 --> 53:18.000
Did the pickup artist be like, oh, I like this Nazi thing,

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
I'm going to steal it, or was it the other way around?

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
And, you know, the reality is they both stole it from me,

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
but I stole it from Wachowskys.

53:24.000 --> 53:29.000
And so, you know, basically, if you go out on the street

53:29.000 --> 53:33.000
and you know, just go, like, you know, down to the local corner

53:33.000 --> 53:36.000
and get a red pill, what you're going to be getting

53:36.000 --> 53:39.000
is either a brown pill or a pink pill.

53:39.000 --> 53:42.000
That is certainly not a product I can endorse.

53:42.000 --> 53:47.000
But, you know, the story of Albert Hoffman, right?

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
Yes, that's the story I do.

53:49.000 --> 53:53.000
So, because still, to this day, most of my audience is,

53:53.000 --> 53:56.000
more than half of my audience listening to this now and in the future,

53:56.000 --> 54:00.000
it will be left-wingers, no matter how many people call me a reactionary

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
or try to smear me in that way.

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
Nonetheless, most of the people who listen to this stuff are themselves

54:04.000 --> 54:08.000
just kind of on the more anti-woke wing of the left wing.

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
So, I'm curious, you probably don't have too many opportunities

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
to address this particular cohort.

54:12.000 --> 54:15.000
I'm kind of curious, you know, you wrote on...

54:15.000 --> 54:19.000
People on the edge of being like, you know, chop-o-heads and so forth.

54:19.000 --> 54:20.000
Yeah.

54:20.000 --> 54:23.000
You know, well, Justin, you know, what would be actually kind of cool is if,

54:24.000 --> 54:29.000
you know, weren't you or aren't you or don't you have a past as a very, you know,

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
unironic leftist?

54:31.000 --> 54:35.000
Can you tell us about the experience of being a junkie?

54:35.000 --> 54:39.000
Yeah, I mean, in many ways, I'm still happy to identify as a leftist in some ways.

54:39.000 --> 54:43.000
As I get older, I get a little bit more socially conservative in certain dimensions.

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
That's partially a life-cycle effect.

54:45.000 --> 54:48.000
It's a pretty robust phenomenon, actually.

54:48.000 --> 54:51.000
But in many ways, my politics haven't really changed.

54:51.000 --> 54:55.000
My kind of cultural strategy for being a free person has changed.

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
I've had to update that a lot.

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
It was really, actually, you might be interested to know this, Curtis,

54:59.000 --> 55:03.000
that it was a blog post I wrote, the beginning of the end for me,

55:03.000 --> 55:06.000
and kind of the organized, institutionalized kind of respectable left,

55:06.000 --> 55:10.000
was really a blog post that I wrote around 2017.

55:10.000 --> 55:13.000
I came to your blog very late, well after its heyday.

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
I just came across people like you and Nick Land.

55:15.000 --> 55:16.000
I was an academic.

55:16.000 --> 55:19.000
I was holed up just reading only approved academic literatures

55:19.000 --> 55:22.000
and just working in a cave on my academic research.

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
I came across your blog.

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
I came across Nick Land's blog.

55:26.000 --> 55:29.000
My initial kind of intuition was just like,

55:29.000 --> 55:32.000
oh, I thought all these right-wingers were supposed to be stupid,

55:32.000 --> 55:35.000
but these are clearly smart people with serious ideas.

55:35.000 --> 55:42.000
I was honestly kind of naively shocked to discover some real intellectual horsepower

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
on blogs such as yours and Nick Land's.

55:44.000 --> 55:47.000
I wrote a simple blog post in 2017 as an academic,

55:47.000 --> 55:50.000
very naive, just kind of well-behaved academic,

55:50.000 --> 55:54.000
saying, hey, there are some people on the radical right

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
who are actually really, really smart,

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
and I actually read a lot of it, guys,

55:58.000 --> 56:01.000
and they don't seem that bad.

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
They don't seem half as evil as people say.

56:03.000 --> 56:06.000
They're not endorsing any type of obvious, harmful racism

56:06.000 --> 56:09.000
that I can see you and Nick Land are both at pains,

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
actually, to reject white nationalism.

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
I was like, this is actually interesting.

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
Smart people on the extreme right.

56:15.000 --> 56:19.000
It's actually a valuable thing to have in a genuine free ecosystem

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
of intellectual culture.

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
So I tried to write this blog post to my cop.

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
I think you got a lot of positive feedback on that.

56:25.000 --> 56:28.000
Well, this was the beginning of the end for me.

56:28.000 --> 56:32.000
I got a lot of heat for that and pretty much make a long story short.

56:32.000 --> 56:35.000
That was when I pretty much, it was clear that wasn't allowed

56:35.000 --> 56:38.000
to just simply say, hey, this stuff is worth paying attention to.

56:38.000 --> 56:41.000
I think you'll find generally that if people talk about a Voldemort,

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
they're working for Voldemort.

56:43.000 --> 56:46.000
Well, yeah, so in any event, since you asked,

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
that's when I was pretty much was like,

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
my politics didn't fundamentally change.

56:50.000 --> 56:53.000
I've always been interested in a certain kind of radical left vision,

56:53.000 --> 56:56.000
which I see as associated with transgression and freedom

56:56.000 --> 56:59.000
and a kind of cultural radicalism of...

56:59.000 --> 57:00.000
That's the bait.

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
Yeah, well, in any event.

57:02.000 --> 57:06.000
In any event, it was really then that that was the beginning of the end for me.

57:06.000 --> 57:11.000
And so since then, I've been trying to occupy this space of not...

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
Because in some ways, I'm being baited by the culture

57:13.000 --> 57:16.000
and I'm being baited by other left-wingers to become a right-winger.

57:16.000 --> 57:19.000
The more people call me, oh, Justin, you're a reactionary, you're a racist,

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
because you want to talk with people like Curtis Jarvan,

57:21.000 --> 57:26.000
in some sense, I can feel psychological attraction to owning that, right?

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
I'm not a racist. I've never have been.

57:28.000 --> 57:31.000
I don't have many even right-wing attitudes or opinions,

57:31.000 --> 57:34.000
but the sociology of it is pushing me into it.

57:34.000 --> 57:38.000
And so I noticed that and I think it would be easy

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
and self-serving to just join the right-wing groups.

57:40.000 --> 57:43.000
Like they wouldn't make fun of me or call me these nasty names.

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
I could just hang out with them.

57:45.000 --> 57:50.000
But then I realized, no, someone needs to hold this ground of an actual radical left

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
that isn't on board with any of this woke bullshit

57:52.000 --> 57:57.000
and is actually just interested in truly radically free intellectual life,

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
whether it be on the right wing or the left wing or whatever.

57:59.000 --> 58:02.000
And so you asked me to kind of talk about that a little bit.

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
So that's all that's relevant for here.

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
I'm curious from your perspective,

58:06.000 --> 58:09.000
because you don't get to address many anti-woke leftists, presumably,

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
just because of how you're perceived,

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
and I think in many ways you're perceived quite unfairly,

58:13.000 --> 58:18.000
I'm just curious if you maybe have a particular unique message to the anti-woke left.

58:18.000 --> 58:21.000
Well, you know, I do have a lot of these conversations,

58:21.000 --> 58:24.000
but they're typically in private for obvious reasons.

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
Do you have a lot of friends who are leftists?

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
One or two.

58:28.000 --> 58:35.000
But, you know, I don't know, friends is a strong word, contacts perhaps.

58:35.000 --> 58:44.000
But, yeah, you know, the thing is when people use these words,

58:44.000 --> 58:49.000
you know, right and left, these are very, very complicated, deep words,

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
and, you know, people throw them around.

58:51.000 --> 58:56.000
You ever see that, you know, fake viral video of the chimp with AK-47?

58:56.000 --> 59:00.000
You know, I mean, these are words that, you know, are full of 200 years of history,

59:00.000 --> 59:04.000
and so to use them in a naive way, I think, is somewhat dangerous.

59:05.000 --> 59:12.000
You know, certainly, you know, one of the things that I was noticing back, you know,

59:12.000 --> 59:20.000
almost 15 years ago now that I think is very commonplace is that when people,

59:20.000 --> 59:25.000
I think when you talk about, say, you know, your anti-woke leftists, for example,

59:25.000 --> 59:30.000
they'll have this wonderful word, the professional managerial class, you know,

59:30.000 --> 59:35.000
which is, you know, I mean, it's a lot of syllables, you just say, the ruling class,

59:35.000 --> 59:39.000
you know, or the governing class is a little less pejorative.

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
I was certainly brought up in that class.

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
My father was an American diplomat.

59:43.000 --> 59:46.000
I went to Johns Hopkins in Brown in Berkeley.

59:46.000 --> 59:53.000
And so, you know, I definitely wouldn't say that, you know, I have any,

59:53.000 --> 59:56.000
I thought of kind of committing treason to this class.

59:56.000 --> 59:59.000
Actually, I love these people, they're my people.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Culturally, you know, I can hang out with middle Americans,

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:09.000
but I'm much more likely to get along with elite blue state ruling class Americans.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:17.000
But, you know, one of the things about this ruling class is that I think it's become

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:20.000
very much kind of corrupted by power.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:23.000
I think it's kind of merits as human beings, it's intelligence,

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.000
it's ability to take standardized tests, it's cleverness.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:32.000
These things have not dropped at all, but it's effectiveness and it's wisdom,

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:37.000
I think, are much lower than they were in the age of Woodrow fucking Wilson.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:42.000
And, you know, that's kind of the tragedy that I think needs to be addressed.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:47.000
And so, in a way, when I look at, you know, the anti-woke kind of leftists in a sense,

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:53.000
even to be, even to have a political agenda implies that you're part of the ruling class.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
You're like, this should be done, that should be done.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
It's like thinking like a king, right?

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.000
You know, one of the things I really try to do is not to think that this way

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:04.000
and not to have, not to think in terms of agenda politics

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:08.000
because you're basically implying that you're a ruler in some sense.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
Well, you know, you're either in the loop or you're not in the loop.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
If you're in the loop, you know it.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
If you're not in the loop, you're basically a sports fan.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:17.000
And so you're kind of having this kind of embarrassing pornographic experience,

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
you know, with respect to power.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:24.000
And I really try to avoid that, especially in public.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:32.000
And so, in a way, it's like my, you know, message to these people is, you know,

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.000
I think that they've, you know, it's like if you look at your average,

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.000
you know, get even past the anti-woke leftist.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.000
If you look at your average, I don't like to use pejoridose,

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
but I might say a Bernie Bro.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:48.000
You know, so if you're a Bernie Bro, basically, you've noticed that there's something a little weird

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
about the Democratic Party.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:54.000
And that's maybe it's not, you know, like Hillary Clinton is not like this kind of pure angel of light

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.000
that you used to maybe think she was.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:02.000
And so, in a way, you know, what you've done is kind of taken this kind of first, you know,

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:05.000
skeptical step in a sense.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:08.000
But, you know, one step is not really a journey.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.000
And so, you know, when you basically look at these, you know,

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:16.000
when you look at the DNC shitting on Bernie or you look at the New York Times shitting on Bernie,

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
and you're like, wow, this is very unfair.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:24.000
And then you go and read, you know, the next thing down in which you trust this institution absolutely.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:29.000
And it's like once that absolute trust gets questioned,

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:35.000
what you'll find is that there's never really a point at which you stop stripping away layers.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.000
And, you know, you strip away layers and layers and layers and layers and layers.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:43.000
And sooner or before you know it, you're like debunking the fucking American Revolution, right?

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Which literally happened to me.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.000
I mean, I could debunk the American Revolution for you, you know.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Go for it, man.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Do we need that?

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
If you'd like to, whatever you'd like.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.000
I think people would be interested.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Do you want me?

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Okay, so I'll try to be brief.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
Obviously, very complicated series of events.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:09.000
The American Revolution is basically the Vietnam War in the 18th century with Britain in the position of the U.S.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:17.000
It's actually a civil conflict in between two factions, kind of, not just kind of left and right,

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:20.000
but, you know, Wig and Tory, but these are also religious factions.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:23.000
So it's dissenter or puritan against Anglican.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:28.000
You know, all these things are not, they're not consistently aligned, but they're sort of generally aligned.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:34.000
And so, you know, the way from an 18th century English perspective to think of America,

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:38.000
imagine you're like a puritan in England.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Suppose, it's not quite the same thing, but suppose you're a libertarian today.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:46.000
And then you hear about the libertarian paradise that's been built in Honduras.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.000
You would be very supportive of that paradise.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:57.000
And then, you know, if your, you know, government, you know, sent the Marines to go and wipe out the libertarian paradise in Honduras,

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
you would have a bad reaction to that.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:08.000
And so, there's this sort of strange situation arises where, you know, there's this conflict between two segments of English society,

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:15.000
and then that conflict is a cold war at home, but abroad it's actually a hot war.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:25.000
And that hot war, essentially, the Americans win the war not because they're militarily superior,

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:33.000
but because Britain has very little will to fight at any point and loses that will, basically, completely.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:37.000
So question, are the founding fathers based or cringe?

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Well, you know, there's a lot of, there's a lot, you're including a lot of different individuals there.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Sort them out then, or the ones you have.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:51.000
So, you know, there's definitely a cringe aspect to Jefferson, but I mean,

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:55.000
because, you know, Jefferson, you know, becomes this huge fan of the French Revolution.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
He's like this massive Francophile.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:02.000
You know, he writes these things about the French Revolution where he's like, you know, the tree of liberty must be watered with blood, you know.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Like, have you ever listened to the lyrics of the Marseillais?

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
I'm not sure I recall.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Like, the French national anthem is all about like, we must drown the country in the blood of the foreigners, or what the fuck, right?

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
They sing this.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:25.000
And so, you know, there are aspects of the American Revolution which are, especially the early American Revolution, which are very, very Jacobin-like.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:32.000
So if you look at a figure like Samuel Adams, who kind of disappears from history because he's just a fuck.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:37.000
You know, like, he's like, you know, who would Samuel Adams be?

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:42.000
You know, Bill Ayers is not too far away from Samuel Adams, right?

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:47.000
These are really just this complete rabble, completely unprincipled rabble-raser.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:50.000
And they were all torn on the French Revolution. This was a major point of attention.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:55.000
Well, later. I mean, of course, this is well before the French Revolution, right, because it's 1775, right?

01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:05.000
But, you know, the French Revolution is this kind of dark imitation of the American Revolution done by these Anglophiles, basically.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:15.000
And, you know, but of course we forget is that our Glorious Constitution, you know, is established in 1789, is established in a reactionary coup.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Not only is the Constitution a reactionary coup basically orchestrated by George Washington and his friends, a very monarchical individual.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:33.000
One of the things you'll notice is basically the first, you know, you probably can name, you know, the first American Constitution, the Articles of Confederation.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:39.000
The period of basically the Congress of the Confederation totally airbrushed out of history.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Do you know who America's first president was? It was John Hansen, the president of the Congress.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:54.000
And the results of that system were so disastrous, and the results of that system were identified by people like John Adams, literally with democracy.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:07:03.000
And, you know, basically, like there was just a period of like, they were just like, this is a shit show, we have to establish basically responsible aristocratic government.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:09.000
We have to replace democracy with oligarchy. And so we're going to run this constitutional convention thing.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.000
But you like that part?

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Well, I mean, that part was, you know, that part was an improvement in that situation.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:25.000
You know, this certainly, the new republic was very much an aristocratic republic, and, you know, it managed to subsist.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:34.000
I mean, people go and watch, you know, Hamilton. I mean, if God, if they knew the things Hamilton said about democracy, I mean, you know, I'm like, Alex, you got to calm down.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:48.000
So, you know, I mean, it's a complicated era. You can't reduce, you know, the like, you know, 25 years between 70, 75 and 1800 to like, these people were based or cringe.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Sure, of course.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:54.000
But yeah, if you want to read about this, let's get off the subject, which is very, very technical.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:08:02.000
You know, the one thing that I discovered that's absolutely wonderful is, let me tell you, in a form of a parable, let's say you grew up in Slobovia.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Imaginary country. And all you know, all you go to school, you hear about the glories of the Slobovian Revolution.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:13.000
You know, of course, that there was a Slobovia before the revolution.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:20.000
You know, like, there was a period of, you know, Slobovia was under the heel of an evil monarchy, you know, that, right?

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:31.000
And the, you know, the hero of the Slobovian Revolution, George Washington Tonovitch, you know, changed all of that, statues to him, or everywhere, yada, yada, yada, yada.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:38.000
So, you know, you're, you grew up believing this, you know, and being like a little cult of personnel.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:42.000
It's George Slobovitch Day, whatever, right? Washingtonovitch.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:53.000
And then one day, you know, some people at this company, Slugal, you know, do something weird for, like, just weird pothead reasons,

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:57.000
which is they're like, we're going to put all books ever written in Slobovian online.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Of course, this includes books from before the revolution.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Like, it includes all kinds of weird books, right?

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:06.000
And stuff that's just, like, totally not cool.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:13.000
And so one day, you're on Slugal and you're browsing, you know, these books, and you're like, for some reason, you type in the phrase,

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:16.000
True History of the Slobovian Revolution.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:26.000
And the first result, I believe this still works, the first result of this is a book whose title is True History of the Slobovian Revolution.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:31.000
And this book, turns out, was written over 100 years ago.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:36.000
And you're like, oh, that's interesting, I wonder what these old weirdos 100 years ago thought about this Slobovian Revolution.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:41.000
And you start reading it and you're like, oh, oh, well, that makes so much sense.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Oh, well, I never understood that at all.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
You know, it's like, so here's an example.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.000
You know, ever been, anyone here been to Philly?

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Probably some people.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Ever been to Valley Forge?

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:56.000
How close is Valley Forge to Philadelphia?

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Pretty, it's like 20 miles.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
You could walk there in a day, right?

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:11.000
So how is it that in the winter of, I think, 77 or 78, I think 77, maybe no, 78, whatever, I'm not one for details.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Lord Howe is partying like a monster in Philadelphia.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.000
He's occupied Philadelphia.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:24.000
He's gone off and left Burgoyne, who is marching down, remember the Saratoga where the tide turns, yada, yada, you remember like the third grade history.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Burgoyne has this plan, Burgoyne, who's an actual Tory, also a playwright, by the way, has this plan to basically cut the Republican half by invading from Canada down the Hudson.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:42.000
And basically Howe, who's the overall commander, ghosts him.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Literally, like basically just ignores the plan, like he's like, I didn't even get that letter, goes and occupies Philadelphia, which is a very civilized town, and just like parties like an animal all winter.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:00.000
Meanwhile, in Valley Forge, 20 miles away, George Washington is starving with his troops.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Now, it was the 18th century, they didn't usually fight in the winter, but come on.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Can't you go out there and be like, hey, why don't you guys surrender?

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.000
Do you want a hamburger?

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:13.000
And like militarily, it simply doesn't make sense.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:25.000
And essentially what Sidney Fisher, the author of this book, The True History of the American Revolution, points out is that you just can't understand the history of the American Revolution.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Just like you can't understand the history of Vietnam, if you're only understanding it militarily.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:39.000
You have to have an accurate and what I would call Machiavellian, which just means realistic understanding of what was actually going on.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
And once you do, you're like, this makes so much sense.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:49.000
So here you're reading this book, it's not even a primary source, and you're just like, this is much more convincing than anything I've ever learned.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:57.000
So that was like, and the great thing about debunking the American Revolution is that, you know, like, to quote Henry Ford, all of history is bunk.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:02.000
You can debunk basically any conflict in history.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:03.000
It will be written by the winners.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
It's always more complicated than that.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:11.000
But, you know, you want to go in and, you know, rewrite the history of World War II of the Civil War.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:18.000
You can get away with World War I kind of, you know, you'll get a lot of, that's a very complicated and interesting problem.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:26.000
But the Revolutionary War, what's amazing about debunking the American Revolution is that now in 2020, nobody actually gives a shit about it.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:29.000
You can basically go and be in a bar and be like, man, the British were right.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:32.000
We should still be under King George III, and we'll be like, man, that's cool.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:35.000
It's so cool that you think that.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:40.000
Well, this is another one of those strange convergences with the radical left-wing critique, right?

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Because the left also debunks the American Revolution.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Oh, yeah, we're supposed to admire those people, but really they were property-owning slave owners.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:50.000
That's all bunk.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
It's in a weird way you're converging with them.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Well, you know, what I would say about, you know, if you read like, you know, you can read, you know, Chomsky is a great one for, you know, Chomsky is also a pill dispenser.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:09.000
You know, and you'll read, it's sort of interesting when you read kind of leftist debunkings.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:16.000
And, you know, when I use the word leftist, I kind of mean, you know, you've kind of become a ringwraith to some extent.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:26.000
So, you know, you're kind of corrupted by when it's someone like Chomsky, say, would read the American Revolution or any kind of, you know, don't even start me on like the 1619 project.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:34.000
Basically, they're writing their own history that's generally based on actual facts, although, you know, for the 1619 project, I think we've gone a little beyond that.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:40.000
But generally based on actual facts, but you're writing this history to be useful.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:45.000
And so you're looking for something, here is a piece of history that is useful to me, right?

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:54.000
And in what way could the story of, you know, the Crimean War be useful to the audiences of today?

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:59.000
That is the mindset of these people, and that is just not at all the mindset of the historian.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
And it comes back to power, doesn't it?

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:04.000
Yes, it comes back to being corrupted by power.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:10.000
And so, you know, the mistake that people who have a problem with this system often make is they imitate it.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:17.000
And they say, well, you know, here's my new history of the American Revolution that's, like, useful for the opposite reason.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:25.000
And that's not, like, that is also doing a grave disservice to the people, you know, these are real people who fought, you know, in this war.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:37.000
And, you know, if you look at any war in history, you should be able to understand and empathize with both sides and feel and understand why both sides thought that they were fighting for what they thought was right.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:45.000
If you can't do that for any conflict, okay, individuals can be psychopaths, but you can't necessarily identify with a crazy individual.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:50.000
But if you can't identify with a group of individuals, it just means you don't understand them.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Well put. And this kind of brings us to your recent idea about the Clear Pill, in a way, because I see, especially your recent ratings, as it's almost as if you're trying to debunk ideas on the left and the right.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:12.000
I think one of the, yeah, so basically the goal of this series, which I'm currently plug, plug, plug writing at the Claremont Institute's American Mind blog.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:19.000
That's kind of the American Mind is, if you don't mind me saying so, kind of the second tier publication of the Claremont Institute.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:22.000
If it was really prestigious, I'd be in the Claremont Review books.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:27.000
But maybe I aspire to that. Or maybe I don't.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:35.000
But, you know, the American Mind, the editors of that have done a really great job of kind of reaching out to kind of interesting new thinkers.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.000
Certainly, you know, probably people more interesting than myself.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:52.000
And the, and so the goal of this series is basically, you know, I would say if I made, you know, and I wrote like a few hundred thousand words in that damn blog.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:16:08.000
So I made a lot of mistakes, but I think if I made any kind of strategic mistakes in kind of how to think about this problem, it was the idea that sort of the cure for the present way of thinking and the way you should be thinking instead were one thing.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:12.000
And I don't think they're one thing and they can't really be understood as one thing.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:23.000
The thing is that whether you're, you know, a progressive or a Nazi or a constitutional conservative or something else, I suppose there must be something else I can't think of it.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:38.000
Maybe a centrist pragmatist. You basically are kind of attached to a particular way of seeing the current world that I would say contains certain contradictions.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:51.000
And, you know, the way that you want to always carry out in kind of an intervention, whether it's a personal intervention or a political intervention is to say, let's think about these contradictions and what you think.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:17:05.000
It's like my example of like democracy versus politics. I'm like, I'm just asking you a question. I'm like, if you can explain the difference why, how democracy can be good and politics can be bad, but they're both the same thing, then you have no need of my products.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:13.000
You must know something I don't, because I feel like I know the explanation and it's a pretty darn complicated explanation.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:26.000
And, but sort of before you make that explanation, basically, you know, you have these kinds of attachments to these causes, these issues, even these individuals, these parties, these cultural groups, which are very, very emotional.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:33.000
You know, it's like being a Lakers fan or something, probably some Lakers fans in the room. Let's have a moment for Kobe.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:55.000
All right. And the, and yet you know that there's sort of nothing rational about being a Lakers fan, that it's actually kind of stimulating this sort of political instinct, this thymos, this desire to be relevant and powerful, which ends up in like team spirit and like, you know, just cheering mindlessly in front of the TV.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Again, the pornography analogy suggests itself. And so in a way, I'm basically like, you know, to kind of take that analogy a little bit further, I'm like, all right, young men, let's face it, you want to get laid.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:22.000
The first thing you have to do, like the way you're thinking of getting laid is basically, how do I meet the girls on the porn site? That is basically the way you currently think about politics.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Okay. So they basically the way people on the left or the right or both, really both. And in order for you to basically have like this kind of normal romantic life, like a normal person, you know, the kind of the first step is to just give up your porn.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:42.000
So I'm basically going to go through all these different kinds of porn and I'm going to explain why it's not realistic.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:56.000
And so that's kind of the purpose of the series in a way to basically say, okay, you know, as a progressive, you know, this is part two, I'm not under the illusion that many progressives will read it, but there are a lot of them, so some will.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:08.000
And I'm like, here is kind of what's going on in your head when this stuff excites you. And maybe it's like, if you think a little harder, this is not the thing that you should be into.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:23.000
And then basically the same and it's a very different story for why constitutional conservatism is hopeless and should give up. And then another one for why white nationalist Nazis or whatever you want to call them are hopeless and should give up.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:34.000
And so, you know, when you basically said, hey, you know, all of these things are hopeless. I'm like, imagine, you know, all these things are hopeless. Everyone is trying to change things and nothing is changing.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:50.000
You know, that kind of fits together in a way. And so to detach people from these kind of false, you know, very false kinds of systems, first of all, it's a service, you know, in itself, you know, the way I think about, you know, how should you think about politics or power?

01:19:50.000 --> 01:20:03.000
Let's say that, okay, you're probably an American. Let's say you moved to Costa Rica. You become an expat in Costa Rica. What is your attitude toward Costa Rican elections and the Costa Rican government?

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:13.000
Do you consider that this government has no right to rule over you because you did not consent to it? Do you not obey the speed limit? No. You obey the Costa Rican law because you live in Costa Rica.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:23.000
Do you vote in Costa Rican elections? Do you want to vote in Costa Rican elections? Do you like notice it in anything more than a practical way? No, then you're sort of completely detached.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:34.000
And that level of kind of detachment from the desire to change the world is very, very difficult. But paradoxically, I believe it's what's necessary if you're actually going to change the world.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
That's seriously fucked up.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:41.000
No, that's something that you and I definitely agree on. I come from a more kind of left-wing trajectory and you from a more right-wing trajectory.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:55.000
But I think it's a fair to say that you and I probably agree on something like the proposition that true intellectuals, whether they be artists or writers or philosophers or scientists, if what you're really looking for is true disinterested truth-seeking,

01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:07.000
one must, A, detach from power and any dreams or hopes of having power or political efficacy, and B, it's probably going to be in some weird nether region beyond left and right.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:12.000
Yeah, I mean, again, you use these words left and right. These are very complicated words.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
But that's my point, right? They're not really good.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:32.000
I would say that a more immediate problem, I would say what people normally mean when they say left and right is simply competing cultural groups that are essentially competing ethnic religions almost in a way.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:45.000
And one of my strongest beliefs is that if this country ever functions again or has a government that functions again or at least maybe can test people for the coronavirus, I think they're getting around to that.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:59.000
The difference in capacity between this country and China in that is remarkable. I mean, frankly, next week I wouldn't be here and you all would be wearing masks.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:15.000
But I wouldn't be here. And maybe I'm wrong. But I think that's the case and it's very possible that you're going to see the level of state capacity that we have in this country compared very directly.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:35.000
And if you're ever at a point where basically this country actually works and functions as a country, I think it's going to involve, like, I think one of the most striking things about right versus left is I think one of the main reasons that people support either side is fear of the other.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:50.000
The main reason that people feel passionate about being leftists is they have the sense that they're defending this little dot of light of civilization against this horde of ignorant peasants.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:23:03.000
And anyone who has grown up with that feeling knows that sense that we are the enlightened few and the masses out there are coming with burning pitchforks to spear us.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:11.000
And this is in the modern world a ridiculous fear, but historically this is not a ridiculous fear.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:19.000
And so you have this sense of this kind of very deep and bitter loathing between the upper class and the middle class.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Most people call when they say middle class they say lower middle class and when they say mean upper class they say middle class.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:31.000
But basically between the professional managerial classes and anti-woke leftists would put it.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:37.000
And what would you call the Trump voters, the Pearls, would you say Pearls?

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
Don't say the Pluribals.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:43.000
That's a good question. I don't think you could say Pearls. Pearls is much more general left and right.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:46.000
There are Bernie supporters that are Pearls?

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:52.000
No, there are Bernie supporters that are Pearls but they're not cultural Pearls or they wouldn't be Bernie supporters.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:24:01.000
This identification of class stratification with your bank account is one of the characteristic distortions of leftism.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
It's all about culture.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:08.000
If you've ever been a grad student and some fellow grad student because his stipend is low is like I'm poor.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:11.000
And it's like no, you're not poor, you're broke.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
And those are just very different things.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:21.000
And so like status is a much more important determination of class than salary or bank account.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:29.000
And it's definitely a status conflict between essentially, well if you'll allow me to use Marxist terminology,

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:36.000
you have the professional managerial class of the Pearls and what Marx would call the lump and proletariat.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:45.000
And so there's this sort of alliance of the ruling class and the lump and proletariat which is basically...

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
The Democratic Party.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
You could call it that.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:54.000
And I really hate using these like code words.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
Like they just become inflammatory.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:01.000
And it's like at least you said Democratic Party.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:04.000
If you'd said Democrat Party, that would have meant you were on Fox News.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:12.000
And my stepfather is a longstanding Hill staffer on the Democratic side.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:16.000
If you want to get him to explode at dinner, just say Democrat Party.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
Which obviously I would never do.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:24.000
But the thing is, my point is that basically if anything is ever going to actually work in this country,

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:30.000
it basically can only be as an alliance of all three of these classes.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:37.000
You cannot imagine any successful government that is like a government of like one over the others.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:48.000
And so for me kind of the big political historical question is to just take a really grand scope.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:52.000
Are we in the late Roman Republic or the late Roman Empire?

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:56.000
So if we're in the late Roman Empire, we're absolutely completely fucked.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:01.000
And there are certainly many kind of parallels that you can draw between, for example,

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:07.000
the intellectual class that Justin was part of and like the grammarian ruling class of the late Roman Empire.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:12.000
You might have seen this class kind of parodied in a certain Monty Python movie.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:17.000
And really like just completely worthless people.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
But very well educated.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:23.000
And just useless against the Huns or whatever.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:27.000
And or are we in the late Roman Republic?

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:31.000
And that's a very optimistic, you know, most people are like, oh my god, it's like the late Roman Republic.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:34.000
I'm like, that's actually the optimistic perspective.

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:39.000
And so one of the things about the Roman Republic, if you know like the kind of kindergarten version of the Roman Republic,

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:47.000
you know that the whole history of the Republic is this conflict between, first it's the plebeians and patricians,

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:56.000
then those categories kind of become obsolete and it's the optimates versus the popularis, right?

01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:01.000
Which is basically optimates versus popularis is Bernie versus Trump.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
It's as simple as that.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:07.000
And you're like, okay, how does this work out?

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
It's true that they have some civil wars.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:15.000
I don't believe that civil war is possible today, which is another very optimistic perspective, which I will defend.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:23.000
But I just don't believe in violent politics at all, which is very optimistic.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:31.000
But the outcome of this is even more optimistic, which is that it kind of magically ends up with Augustus,

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:34.000
the first Roman Empire, previously Octavian.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:37.000
And Augustus is actually success.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:44.000
And one of the features of the Roman Empire is this whole conflict between red states and blue states.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:54.000
Popularis and optimates, whatever, this whole civil conflict, which had been part of the fabric of the Roman Republic for 400 years,

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:57.000
something like that, not an expert here, disappears.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
It's gone.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
It's never heard of again.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:06.000
So, you know, if you could imagine basically an America in which there's no like red state, blue state conflict,

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:13.000
no race war, none of this garbage, like, you know, okay, what would you trade for that?

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
I think a lot of people would trade.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:20.000
Like, you know, I think a lot of people would be ready to make, you know, pretty large sacrifices for that.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
So in a way, like, you know, what happened exactly?

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:23.000
How did that come about?

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:24.000
Augustus.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:25.000
Have you heard of the guy?

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:26.000
Yeah, heard of him.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
But of course, I know everything you're talking about.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:34.000
But for our audience, you know, please, please, please remind them of a few of the details.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
Okay, well, let's see.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
A quick rundown, if you will.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:44.000
You know, maybe in Roman history, like Trump versus Bloomberg is like Marius versus Sulla.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:49.000
So essentially what happens is one side wins the Civil War.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:57.000
But the side that wins the Civil War is not really, you know, it's like Caesar, who's the one who actually wins,

01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:00.000
and Caesar and Augustus have much the same plans.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:04.000
Caesar just wasn't really careful about his personal security.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:16.000
But they were basically both, they both had the style of unifiers.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:21.000
And they were, and by the way, they didn't claim to have abolished the Republic at all.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
They claimed to have restored and fixed the Republic.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:26.000
You know, they were just the first citizen of the Republic.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:29.000
And, you know, everything was voted on by the Senate.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
Of course, the Senate was a rubber stamp.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:39.000
But, you know, they never restored the title of Rex, of the title of King, which was an old Roman, you know, title.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:44.000
You know, the last Kings of Rome were driven out in like 500-something BC, right?

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:51.000
So they're like, we have saved the Republic, but what we've created in practice is effectively a monarchy.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:57.000
So in some ways, Augustus is actually more like FDR than you might think.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:02.000
And so, you know, let's imagine like, you know, Bloomberg doing a new, new deal.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:06.000
And, you know, like, it's a ridiculous, it could never happen.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:14.000
But, you know, the thing is that, you know, Augustus's Rome, like FDR's Washington, was a start-up nation.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:21.000
Because it was under the absolute control of this guy, Augustus, who was absolutely competent and completely effective,

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:25.000
and had no interest in continuing any of these squabbles.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:28.000
So there's this great story, it's about Caesar rather than Augustus.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:37.000
And I think it sort of expresses the kind of attitude that's kind of necessary in creating kind of anything new and awesome.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:43.000
Of course, you know, nothing happens without, not violence, but force.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:46.000
So, you know, Caesar's force comes from the popularis.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
He's originally a man of the popularis.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:52.000
So, you know, he fights the Civil War, and he's fighting against Cato.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:55.000
And Cato is, like, everyone super respects Cato.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:31:03.000
Cato is, like, imagine, like, some, like, really old-line, you know, Democrat who, like, really believes in the process, really believes in the Republic.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
It's not cynical at all.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:09.000
You know, this is a person who just completely believes in the system.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:10.000
That's Cato.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:14.000
And so, you know, Cato gets beat.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:17.000
And, you know, he does this very Roman thing.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
He commits seppuku, actually.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:27.000
He does this, like, Japanese suicide ritual, and actually cuts his belly with his sword and, like, tears his own intestines out.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:33.000
And his slaves try to push them back in, and he tears them back out again.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:34.000
Super gory.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
And would make a great movie.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:39.000
And so, Cato is beaten, right?

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:43.000
But Caesar basically captures Cato's headquarters.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:46.000
And in Cato's tent, there's a big chest.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:50.000
And the chest is full of letters from his supporters in Rome.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:32:04.000
So, one of the things about these conflicts in Roman history, and you see this extensively in kind of the preludes to that final civil war between, like, Marius and Sulla, is something called proscription.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:12.000
And that idea of proscription is when you win one of these contests, you basically are like, okay, who are the wealthy supporters of the other side?

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:16.000
We are going to kill them and take their property and give it to our friends.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:19.000
I think standard supporters are getting excited listening to you.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:20.000
Yeah, right, right.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:27.000
So, you know, imagine if, like, Trump wins the election, he throws Soros in jail, he takes all of Soros' money and redistributes it to, like, megatards.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:28.000
Right?

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:29.000
If you'll excuse my French.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:36.000
You know, so, this would be a very aggressive action by Donald Trump, but that was absolutely normal in Roman politics.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:40.000
So, basically, a completely normal, expected thing to do.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:46.000
So, you know, Caesar's guys basically find this chest and they're like, holy shit, you won't believe what we found.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
Because we're like, this is the mother load.

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:51.000
Because, of course, a lot of these motherfuckers would write letters to both sides.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:59.000
It'd be like, Kato, man, you're the one, you're really strong, you know, you have these Roman values, and then they'd be like, Caesar, oh my god, you're so Caesar.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:03.000
Right, you know, and so they'd write the same letter to both sides.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:08.000
So, you know, these are the people that you really want to find because these are not your guys, right, that you can't trust them.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
And you really want to kill them and take their property.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:13.000
And then there are the guys who are just against you.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
And you definitely want to kill them and take their property.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:18.000
So, you know, Caesar's guys are super hot to try it, right?

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:19.000
And they're like, what do we do?

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
How do we start working through this?

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:31.000
Caesar's like, okay, take the chest of letters, put it on a bunch of logs, pour olive oil on it, and set it on fire.

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
These guys are like, what?

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
Caesar's like, you don't get it.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
Like motherfuckers, we won.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
They're all our guys now.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:49.000
And so, you know, that sense of basically they're all our guys now is basically essential to anything that actually works.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:34:05.000
And so, you know, that's obviously very far from this vision of peasants with red-hot pitchforks visiting the University of Southampton, I guess, to basically toss you on their devilish burning tines.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:17.000
And it's that absolute opposite, but it also doesn't mean, you know, you must, you know, hound and harry the peasants and, you know, basically go full Spartan on them.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:27.000
And, you know, which is really, I think in many ways, the attitude of not necessarily the, you know, there's definitely, I don't know when I say go full Spartan.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:36.000
One of the things the Spartan elite like to do is basically if you were like a young Spartan, like, you know, ruling class, like, you know, like Chapa Dude or whatever,

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:49.000
you would basically imagine if like Chapa Dudes like had like secret Chapa parties where they went and like just found like drove out to the suburbs and found like some like Magadude with like a maga sign in front of his hat and just house and just like burned his house down and killed him.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:53.000
That would be like the Spartan way of being a ruling class, right?

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:56.000
And, you know, I think there's people that like to do that.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:00.000
And I'm very confident of it.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:13.000
And so that like, you know, that mentality is a very dark and evil mentality, which in a way very much parallels the mentality of the average school shooter today.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:17.000
You know, and I can say average school shooter because frankly, there's a lot of them.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:24.000
And so you kind of see this kind of, you know, like these pathological phenomena emerging out of this conflict.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
And I think it's a very pathological conflict.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:30.000
And I'm certainly, I mean, you know, these are very, you know, banal sentiments.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:34.000
Everybody's going to agree with that. Nobody's going to agree with basically how you get out of it.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
Right. No, that's interesting.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:41.000
So what I want to do in just a minute is open it up to audience questions shortly.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:46.000
But if you have just a little bit more steam Curtis, I thought I'd maybe ask you one or two more questions.

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:47.000
Sure.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:51.000
And specifically, I'd like to ask you about some of the bigger ideas in your writings.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
I don't think there's any really big ideas.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
I don't really have any ideas at all, actually.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:58.000
Well, I can ask you and then you can answer that.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:35:59.000
Sure.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
That's how you'd like to answer that you're more than welcome to.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:05.000
Because we've talked a lot up until now about debunking various ideas on the left and the right.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
And I think you're very good at that.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:13.000
But if one reads your blog on qualified reservations closely and there's a lot of it to read, but I have read most of it.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:17.000
One does see certain big ideas, more positive ideas, I think, more positive visions.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
I disagree very strongly.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:23.000
I think that the really important content there is purely negative.

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:29.000
It's basically the most important thing is an absence of belief.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:34.000
There are probably some positive ideas behind it, but you should really focus on the absence of belief.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:35.000
Well, let me give you an example.

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:40.000
And while I'm asking you just one or two questions about what I see as the bigger positive ideas in your writing,

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:44.000
the audience, you all should be thinking about good questions to ask if you're interested to ask any.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
And I'll turn to you in just a minute.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
So one would be formalism, for instance.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:49.000
Right.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:53.000
This is how you describe your political philosophy in one word.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:56.000
I think it's kind of the most efficient way you describe your political philosophy.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:00.000
And if I understand it correctly, I'll give people just a very quick and dirty summary of the idea.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
And you can clarify if you need to or what have you.

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
But then I want to ask you about it.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:10.000
The way I understand it is pretty much, Curtis seems to be of the viewpoint that one of the biggest problems in,

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:17.000
especially American politics today, is a bad mapping between the actual distribution of power

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:22.000
and how power is actually acknowledged or formalized or labeled.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:27.000
Where power actually exists is distributed and messy, and no one's really honest about it.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:36.000
Whereas the idea of formalism is that if we could simply account rigorously for who has power and where power is had,

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:41.000
and that's done formally in a way that's rigorous, that this would solve a lot of problems perhaps.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:42.000
Sure.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:45.000
So yeah, I think that's pretty much mostly right.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:50.000
I would recommend, if anyone out there likes books, one of the great,

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:56.000
possibly the greatest work of political science in the 20th century is a book called The Machiavellians by a writer named James Burnham.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:59.000
It's not his most famous book, but it's his best book.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:07.000
Burnham was originally a trotskiest of all things, and like many trotskiests, he found himself a right winger.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:10.000
Maybe the world moved under him, maybe he moved, maybe both.

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:17.000
He wrote this wonderful book called The Machiavellians, which is a summary of what's called the, in English,

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:23.000
sometimes called the Italian School of Political Science, which is over 100 years old.

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:27.000
And it's classic, it's a great figure, really.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:33.000
A guy on a par with Newton and Darwin, in my mind, is a guy named Guy Tanamoska, who's completely unknown.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:39.000
He wrote a book called Elements of Political Science, which somehow got into the English title of Theory of the Ruling Class.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:43.000
I think of it as Elements of Political Science, because that's actually his title.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:51.000
If you just read Burnham's very incisive summary of it, that basically gives the basic idea that Justin was just trying to express,

01:38:51.000 --> 01:39:00.000
is essentially that many, in fact, most political systems in the real world have this divergence between formal power,

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:06.000
like how the system is actually supposed to work, and objective power, as in terms of who's actually in charge.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:10.000
It's like, you know, a very simple way to think about this is like Elizabeth II.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:14.000
So Elizabeth II has, you know, kind of nominal authority.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
Actually, she can veto legislation.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:20.000
Most people didn't know that she has the same power as the president, she can veto an act of parliament.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:26.000
The last time an English monarch vetoed an act of parliament, 1707, I think, under Queen Anne.

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:34.000
So, you know, in theory she has it, just like in theory Donald Trump can tell the Justice Department who to prosecute and who not to prosecute,

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:37.000
but in practice that would be taken as a gross violation.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:47.000
And so the reality of power and the formal legal reality of power and the objective reality of power have become diverged.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:50.000
And that's very, very common historically.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:54.000
The Emperor of Japan has not been the Emperor of Japan for over a thousand years.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:59.000
I think something that might not be clear to people or not obvious to people is why is this such a problem,

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:03.000
and why would formalizing that distribution of power be so good?

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:12.000
When you formalize the distribution of power, because basically one of the main benefit for the powerful of this divergence between appearance and reality

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:21.000
is that when the reality is powerless and basically symbolic, when the appearance is powerless and basically symbolic,

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:27.000
then the reality is unaccountable, because no one thinks of it as an organ with power.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:33.000
And this is especially effective if it's decentralized, like any oligarchy.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:42.000
So there's a great example in 7th century France of the Merovingian and the Carolingian kings.

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:52.000
So the Merovingian dynasty are like these long-haired barbarians who conquer Roman Gaul and establish themselves as king.

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:56.000
And of course originally they're badasses, they're like Germanic warriors, right?

01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:04.000
But over time they come to develop a taste for civilization, and they basically turn into the French word,

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:09.000
I can't speak French as quafanien, which means do nothing king literally.

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:18.000
So these kings who are like Clovis the 4th or 5th or 6th or whatever become like Elizabeth the 2nd.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:26.000
Unusually however, the force holding real power is the figure called the mayor of the palace who was originally just a permanent bureaucrat.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:29.000
He's basically the deep state of Merovingian France.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:32.000
But the deep state of Merovingian France is actually a monarchy.

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:36.000
Imagine if the deep state had a boss, there was like a chief deep state person.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
Like that would be the mayor of the palace, right?

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:45.000
And so eventually the mayor of the palace is just like fuck it, I'm running things, and literally what does the king do?

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:50.000
Literally I like bring him out in an ox cart every six months to read a speech I wrote.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:53.000
Fuck this, it's over, it's done, he's not the king anymore.

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:57.000
I'm the king, and this is how this is the origin of Charlemagne.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:58.000
You've heard of Charlemagne?

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
Like there's a rapper I think with that.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
This is the origin of Charlemagne, right?

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:09.000
And so basically here you see actually a real monarchy and a shadow monarchy at the same time.

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:13.000
And the great thing about being the mayor of the palace is like it's like being the deep state.

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:14.000
You're completely unaccountable.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:19.000
Which is absolutely great if you're you, right?

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:27.000
And so in a sense, essentially you might remember originally that I said that this country was not a democracy

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
and I didn't think it should be a democracy.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:34.000
You have this very, very, you know, these very unaccountable permanent structures,

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:38.000
some of which are in the formal government and some of which are outside of it.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:39.000
So here's another example.

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:44.000
Suppose you basically, you're like okay there's this thing called the mainstream media.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:47.000
You might have heard that term in like Breitbart or something.

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:52.000
You know, to someone who's part of it of course you wouldn't say that, you would just say the press.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
The free, the free press, right?

01:42:54.000 --> 01:43:02.000
And when you look at this free press you're like okay I can identify that certain institutions are part of the press

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:03.000
and certain or not.

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
Like what does it mean to be a journalist?

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:06.000
Is that a formal title?

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:09.000
Do I go like get out on my like airline tickets?

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:12.000
Do I say, you know, J instead of mister as a journalist?

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:17.000
No, but yet there's some sense in which it's official.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
There's some sense in which the New York Times is official.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:22.000
Well, you know, without really changing the way the New York Times operates,

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:25.000
you could say we're going to take the Times, you know, and the Post

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:29.000
and we're going to call them part of the federal government.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
They're not going to change the way they operate at all.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:34.000
We're just going to call them the Department of Information

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:37.000
and we're going to call them paper number one and paper number two.

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:42.000
And then they're going to, instead of thinking themselves as public servants,

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:46.000
they'll be civil servants, have exactly the same immunity,

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:51.000
have exactly the same free access to government secrets which they then sell to the public.

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:57.000
And you're like not only is the Department of Information clearly a real part of the government,

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
it's actually the most powerful part of the government.

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
It's actually completely unaccountable.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
And you know what else is cool about the New York Times?

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:09.000
You know, I was having this discussion confidentially with a journalist who should not be named.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:12.000
I only talked to journalists off the record.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:19.000
And I was like, you know, there's a difference between Jeff Bezos' relationship to the Washington Post

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:25.000
and the Salzburgers' family's relationship to the New York Times

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:31.000
because Arthur Salzburger's punch or whatever the fuck they call him is actually part of the news desk.

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:35.000
And if he tells the journalists, hey, I think, or the editors,

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:40.000
hey, I think you need to steer things in this direction or that direction, they'll listen to him.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:46.000
If Jeff Bezos tells the Post, oh, I don't think I really like how you're covering this story.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:50.000
You know what the answer of any self-respecting postjournalist is going to be?

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:55.000
I quit. I'm going to go work for the New York Times, which is a real newspaper.

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:58.000
And do you know how the New York Times is governed?

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
How?

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:03.000
It's an absolute hereditary monarchy.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
Mmm.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
Mmm.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:11.000
Based.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
Yes.

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:14.000
All right.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:15.000
Definitely not cringe.

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:21.000
So the last question I want to ask you before we turn it off to this very patient audience that is sat.

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
Thank you for sitting through all this ridiculous bullshit.

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:26.000
Quietly and wrapped.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
Let's talk about soft corpse real quick.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:31.000
This is, I think, one of your other big ideas that you're kind of known for.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
Sort of an old big idea.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:41.000
Both formalism and soft corpse are kind of like, as I was writing this piece, I was, you know, as I was writing this blog,

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:44.000
of course, I'm thinking at the same time.

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:49.000
And so some of my kinds of perspectives, I mean, I don't disagree with these ideas at all.

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
I just emphasize them a little differently.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:52.000
Sure.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:57.000
Well, the idea of the soft corpse, which many people will, you know, remember if they've read your blog,

01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:00.000
is, there you go, take that shot.

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:01.000
Oh, sip on the whiskey.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:02.000
I thought you were going to throw it back.

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
We're almost done here.

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:05.000
We're almost done here.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:06.000
No, we have to take shots.

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
You've got to get loose for audience questions, that's for sure.

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:09.000
All right.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:10.000
All right.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:11.000
All right.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:12.000
All right.

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:13.000
Sure is.

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:14.000
Skull.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:21.000
The idea of soft corpse, as I understand it, you paint a portrait of a possible political world in which

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:28.000
a very, very large number of relatively small governance structures or polities.

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
This is sometimes known as patchwork.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
This is an idea that a lot of people are actually quite interested in right now.

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:35.000
This is an idea that a lot of people have separately had independently.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:40.000
Of course, yeah, I'm not saying you invented or anything, but in your vision of patchwork,

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:47.000
there would be a kind of governance structure or a kind of polity in which pretty much the

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:51.000
government owns a piece of territory and runs it like a business.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
This is the way it already works, actually.

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
It's just done really badly.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
So it's closely related to formalism.

01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:03.000
Yeah, so if you imagine one of the things I strongly believe in is whenever you're talking

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:08.000
about a group or an entity, you should always use the term that that group uses to refer

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
to itself.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:16.000
So in Washington, if you're writing about the US government, you will say either USG

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:19.000
or the USG either is acceptable.

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:24.000
And actually, coincidentally, there's a company called USG, United States Gypsum,

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
which is like traded on the stock exchange, right?

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:27.000
But they're not the same thing.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:34.000
But in essence, what you're looking at when you're looking at a government is a corporation

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
that owns a country.

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:37.000
It just is.

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:38.000
It's the same thing.

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:42.000
It just sort of has this really strange governance structure.

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:47.000
If you can imagine a corporation governed the way the United States is governed.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:50.000
Imagine if Apple had a Congress and a Supreme Court.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
Maybe it had separation of powers.

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:56.000
So Congress would be like marketing and the executive branch would be like engineering

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:59.000
and be like, you have to separate marketing and engineering.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
And then the Supreme Court is like HR.

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:05.000
I mean, you could imagine doing it that way.

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
But I don't think it would make very good phones.

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:13.000
And one of the things that's most remarkable about the way people think about politics

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:20.000
and democracy today is probably most people here got here in a car.

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
Did you get here in a car?

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
Well, who built that car?

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:25.000
I'm like, well, there's a very simple answer.

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:31.000
That car was built by a monarchy because it was built by a corporation with a CEO

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:36.000
who is essentially in absolute control of that organization.

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
Yet also accountable.

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
I'll get to that in a second.

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
But, you know, you drive a car.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
It was built by a monarchy.

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
You eat at a restaurant.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:47.000
It's a monarchy.

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:50.000
Anyone ever seen Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares?

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:51.000
Amazing show.

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:52.000
It's really, it's not about cooking.

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:53.000
It's about management.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
It's about power and about government.

01:48:55.000 --> 01:49:00.000
And, you know, I realize that Gordon Ramsey is not eligible to be president.

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:03.000
But I mean, you know, if you want a reality show president,

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:09.000
imagine Gordon Ramsey going through, like, the State Department's fridge.

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:14.000
You'd be like, you're, well, yeah, I see you sitting $500 million to this guy.

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:15.000
Wow.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
Who is this person?

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
What is this doing in this drawer?

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:23.000
You know, so, you know, you could imagine that very easily, right?

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:26.000
And if you've seen the show, it's a very good show.

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
The British one is better.

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:34.000
But that's very easy to, like, once you start seeing that equivalence,

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:38.000
you're like, okay, you know, I got here in a car built by a monarchy.

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
I ate a restaurant built by a monarchy.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:43.000
I stayed at a hotel run by a monarchy.

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:47.000
You know, I went and sent a letter at a post office.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
Oh, you know.

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:53.000
And so there's this kind of massive contrast that everyone sees, right?

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:56.000
And, you know, you could even get, you know, anyone will be like, oh, yeah,

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:59.000
benevolent dictatorship is the best, you know, form of government,

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
but how do you make sure it stays benevolent?

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:04.000
As though this is like a question that can't be answered.

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:08.000
And I'm like, no, actually, I think that's a very interesting question.

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
Maybe it does have an answer.

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
And so, you know, the concept of...

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
And the answer is to make them compete?

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:19.000
The answer is, the answer is, I would say, as generally as possible.

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:23.000
If you look at what, you know, your car, you know, your restaurant,

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:27.000
and, you know, Elizabethan England have in common,

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:32.000
they are all what I would call accountable monarchies.

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
And so, you know, let's take Augustus.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:37.000
We talked about Augustus earlier, like Augustus saved Rome.

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:41.000
Everyone in Augustus's Rome is just like, oh, my God, I'm so glad that was over.

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:44.000
I could never even imagine it being over, and yet it's over.

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
This is wonderful.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
That is the unanimous sentiment.

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:51.000
Augustus is, you know, a supremely competent dude.

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
He does fine.

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:58.000
Augustus's successor is Tiberius.

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
There's some questions about Tiberius.

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
You know, this is weird.

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
Yeah, episode with Seginus.

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:08.000
After Tiberius comes a name that you might recognize.

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
Caligula.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
After Caligula, you get Claudius.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
He's kind of a nerdy weirdo.

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:17.000
After Claudius, you get Nero, right?

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:21.000
And so, in a way, when people think about monarchies, you know,

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
that wasn't quite a hereditary monarchy.

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
It had weird things going on.

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:28.000
Hereditary monarchies can have this just like monstrous failure mode

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
where it's like Henry VI.

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
Shakespeare wrote to Henry VI plays.

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
You had an incompetent king of England.

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
It resulted in the wars of the roses.

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:39.000
Massive devastation, right?

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:42.000
And so, you know, and anyone, even if you're like Steve Jobs,

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
you're like this amazing king of Apple, right?

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:48.000
You know, Apple succeeded because Apple is sort of more truly a monarchy

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
than any other corporation.

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
And because of that, it made the most amazing phones.

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:55.000
And they've kept that up, even without Jobs.

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:58.000
You know, but, you know, suppose Steve Jobs,

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:01.000
instead of getting a pancreatic tumor, gets a brain tumor.

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
He goes nuts.

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:06.000
He's like, no, your next phone has to be big.

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
Big! I want a big phone, right?

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
You know, he goes nuts.

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
And who can say no?

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:16.000
No, we can't sell a phone that is the size of an easel, right?

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:20.000
And no one has the right or the power to tell him that.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
And so, he has to be accountable.

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:25.000
And so, in a way, one of the kind of tragedies

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:28.000
of the modern democratic form of government,

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
one thing most people don't know about the title of president,

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
I'm pretty sure I'm right about this.

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:33.000
I hope I'm not wrong.

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
But even if I'm wrong, it's a good story.

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
President is actually originally, you know,

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
it's used as a corporate title and a political title.

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:43.000
You imagine that the corporate title is like a copy of the political title.

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:44.000
Not so.

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:47.000
It was actually a corporate title before it was a political title.

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
And one of the things about the Puritans,

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
who basically founded the Republic,

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:55.000
they were very experienced in forming like trading companies and so forth.

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:58.000
And so, the idea of kind of the Congress being,

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:01.000
in a way, kind of like a board of directors,

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:05.000
in a sense to whom the CEO is accountable,

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:08.000
is kind of, it's like almost there in the Constitution,

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:09.000
but it's not there.

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
So we have this shit show, right?

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
But it's kind of almost there.

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
And, you know, the modern corporation

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:18.000
hadn't really even been invented by the time.

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:21.000
You know, it's sort of, there were these kind of prototypical things,

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:26.000
but, you know, you get the real modern joint stock corporation in the 19th century.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:29.000
And I'm so crazy, I actually think the Industrial Revolution

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
was actually the corporate revolution.

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
Very unpopular belief, right?

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:36.000
You know, because basically people learn how to operate

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:41.000
in these effective, these structures that were like states, essentially,

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:44.000
but they were like secondary states under the main states.

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
And it was like, you look at like Amazon,

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:49.000
Amazon's like 500,000 employees or something,

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:52.000
you know, that's enough to govern the world, right?

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:56.000
And that, you know, is accountable to this one guy, Jeff Bezos.

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:59.000
And like, it's not just, he's not just a figurehead,

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:03.000
like it really, you know, Bezos is like a jobs like figure in some ways, right?

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:06.000
And so that's kind of the ideal of monarchy.

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
And then, of course, you have Caligula and Nero.

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:11.000
So in your model then, in an ideal world,

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
the United States government would be,

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:16.000
the distribution of power would be fully formalized.

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:19.000
We would turn it into essentially a joint stock corporation

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:23.000
in which the power holders would be shareholders in a corporation.

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:27.000
And then that corporation would run the country or run the territory for profit.

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
There's a crucial, there's actually, there's a,

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:32.000
there's a crucial mistake that you're making, I think.

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:38.000
And this is an over, like, this is why I don't really use that terminology anymore,

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:41.000
because, you know, what you're saying is right, but it's also wrong.

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:47.000
And, you know, the way in which it's wrong is it has this kind of mechanical,

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:50.000
it's sort of almost, I think a lot of, you know,

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:54.000
the only reason I would recommend not reading my old blog is that

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:58.000
I think a lot of the material in it in some ways was kind of designed to be

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:01.000
as kind of harsh and off-putting and difficult as possible.

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
You know, which was just kind of...

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
One notices that right away, I think.

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
Yeah, it was just kind of juvenile of me.

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
It's what makes it fun, though.

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:13.000
And I would, I for one would definitely recommend you read Curtis's blog.

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:14.000
Fine.

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:19.000
And the, you know, part of the problem is that this is my free content

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:22.000
and I want to write a book that's going to compete with this.

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:26.000
And it's just a sheer matter of the grift, Justin.

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
Oh, I get it, I get it.

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
So, like, real artists grift.

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:34.000
And the, you know, Samuel Johnson, Samuel...

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:37.000
Not Samuel, Samuel Johnson, Samuel Johnson.

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:42.000
The, you can see I shouldn't have knocked back that shot.

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:43.000
Samuel Johnson...

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:44.000
We definitely should have.

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:49.000
Samuel Johnson, you know, said, you know, only a fool wrote for anything but money.

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
In that case, I'm definitely a fool.

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:55.000
And the...

01:55:55.000 --> 01:56:00.000
So, yeah, so in a way, the way you stated it is stated in a relatively,

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:03.000
in a way that's sort of both off-putting and wrong.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:07.000
And one of the things about, one of the things, most people, like,

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:12.000
even people who are, like, you know, like, say, business school professors.

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:15.000
And I do know one or two business school, well, at least one business school professor.

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:19.000
And even people who are business school professors are basically,

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:24.000
in some ways, think of the way corporate governance works in the wrong way

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:27.000
because they're like, the shareholders govern the corporation.

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:32.000
The reality is having actually been the CEO of a motherfucking corporation,

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:41.000
the reality is the CEO is completely in charge but completely accountable to the board.

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
I was my own board, so it was a little different.

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:46.000
But if you actually have a board, if you're so unlucky as to actually have a board,

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
you're accountable to that board.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:55.000
But the thing is, if the board gets involved in the governance of your corporation,

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
something is completely fucked.

01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:01.000
And if the shareholders get involved, something is profoundly fucked

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:04.000
and your corporation is almost certain not to survive.

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:09.000
Or, like, either your corporation is not going to survive or you are not going to survive.

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:14.000
And that is the only reason why shareholders would get involved in, like, shareholder democracy.

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:19.000
And so, when you think, when you look at this structure of, like, the shareholders and the board,

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:22.000
it's not a management structure, it's not a power structure,

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:28.000
it's not actually micromanaging, like, the board of Apple was never second-guessing Steve Jobs' decisions.

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:33.000
It fired Steve Jobs once, it was probably prepared to fire him again.

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:38.000
And it would have fired him if he'd gotten a brain tumor and started selling phones the size of a fucking window.

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:43.000
But it didn't need to do that, and it shouldn't have done that.

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000
And so, Steve Jobs was accountable.

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:51.000
And the thing is, the mechanism he was accountable to, because it was not actually governing the company,

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:57.000
was not actually corrupted by power, because it was not willing power.

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
It was just a backup safety mechanism.

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:05.000
And so, the accountability structure in an accountable monarchy is a backup system.

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:11.000
It's not actually sort of in power, it's just like, oh, yeah, if things get fucked up, we'll fix it.

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:12.000
Makes sense.

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:15.000
Makes sense to me. What do you all think?

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
Ladies and gentlemen, Curtis Jarvan.

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
Alright.
