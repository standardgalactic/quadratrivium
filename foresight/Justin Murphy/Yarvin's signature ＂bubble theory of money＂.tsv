0	6160	Well, actually the first time I wrote about this was for a little site before my blog
6160	17480	in 2005, and so at the time really I was thinking about the age-old problem of the Austrian
17480	24200	theory of money, which is really first elucidated by Karl Manger, which is the question of why
24200	28760	certain kinds of goods seem to have anomalous value.
28760	35360	Well, of course, often focus on the material utility of the classic, you know, sort of
35360	40640	pre-modern monetary standards of precious metals, and they're like, ooh, it's valuable.
40640	48360	But in fact, these goods are grossly overvalued, considering if you analyze them as simply
48360	50960	as commodities, they don't make sense.
50960	58240	You see an enormous stock of these commodities, and that stock keeps being accumulated instead
58240	66680	of drawn down, and the price is wildly disproportionate to the demand for industrial use of these goods.
66680	73920	So there's obviously something sort of interesting going on here, and the simplest way to think
73920	80120	about it is that money is essentially a store of value, it's a medium of savings.
80120	85320	It's a way that you move purchasing power from the present into the future.
85320	90720	Even in the presence of financial instruments like bonds don't really change the need to
90720	97280	physically shift purchasing power from the present to the future, even if you lend money
97280	101080	to be returned in the future, you're lending it to someone who therefore is holding money.
101080	104640	So lending abstractly should not change the demand for money.
104640	107800	So there's always a demand for some such good.
107800	114760	And when you look at the sort of game theory of the demand for this good, which is sort
114800	123240	of uses some concepts that the classical Austrians didn't really have at hand, you see that you're
123240	136920	basically looking at a coordination problem, because you have to standardize on some store
136920	139560	of value, which is going to be overvalued.
139560	145520	And so you have at least one good that has to be overvalued in an economy.
145520	153400	But if you have more than one, that's an unstable competition, whereas to have exactly one, and
153400	158160	you know, there can be only one, as they used to say in the movie Highlander, a great, great,
158160	166760	great 80s movie, the so the stable state of the system just very, very abstractly is a
166800	170600	state in which there is one dominant money.
170600	179160	And so what happens when that standard is created or when standards change, which is a very, you
179160	185840	know, sort of cataclysmic financial event, this, of course, is the, you know, the Bitcoin
185840	192640	hyper monetization, Bitcoin maximalism, essentially theory, what happens when one of these
192680	199160	standards is created is basically people move their savings into this good.
199160	205600	And if this good is an appropriate money, appreciating its price will not substantially
205600	212240	appreciate its supply, which is obviously very important, and violated a little bit in the
212240	213480	case of the precious metals.
213480	218000	I mean, when the gold price goes up, it increases gold mining a little bit, but the amount of
218000	222680	newly mined gold is still quite small compared to the world gold stock.
223160	232280	And so what will happen is that basically people will buy this good up in sort of exactly the
232280	238400	same way as GameStop stock was bought up last year.
238760	247680	And so when something goes up, because everyone is buying in, and not because it has
248080	252200	any intrinsic value or utility, that looks like a bubble.
252400	254560	It's in fact the same thing as a bubble.
254600	260080	And so when we look at, you know, sort of a financial bubble, we can see sort of an
260080	263560	attempt to restandardize a money.
263560	269800	And that attempt is sort of if the bubble pops, you know, and there are various ways
269800	274880	that certainly Bitcoin could, in theory, pop, if the bubble pops, it looks like this
274880	277200	ridiculous tulip scam all over again.
277520	282720	If it goes to completion, it looks like, you know, you bought into, you know, this incredible
282720	284840	thing, you know, very early.
284840	296120	And so, you know, the general cause for sort of an intrinsic demand to restandardize money
296120	302120	today is basically monetary dilution.
302120	306960	And when I say monetary dilution, most people will sort of define the stock of
307400	313360	money in dollars using very narrow instruments, like M0, M1.
313640	321760	I prefer to basically describe the stock of dollars as the total net worth in dollars of
321760	325160	all people holding dollars and dollar denominated financial instruments and
325160	326200	financed assets.
326560	332520	And that's essentially defining the dollar supply as the sum of personal net worth,
332520	335400	which is a statistic, I don't know how accurate it is.
335720	338480	It's a statistic that, you know, the Fed keeps.
338800	345160	And so when you see personal net worth, I think in like 2021, it may have gone up by
346240	351040	or 2020 to 21, it was going up by 20 trillion dollars a year.
351720	356960	This is obviously not the stuff that we have is getting 20 trillion dollars more valuable.
357360	359720	You know, maybe we have wine and the wine is aging.
361240	363080	I don't think that's how it's working.
363440	372560	It's basically a sort of this way of creating dollars broadly stated when the stock
372560	374600	market goes up, everyone feels good.
374880	378560	It is no different from printing money and sending it primarily to rich people.
379120	383360	And so what you're doing, you know, you're actually running this very cynical
383360	384840	economy that's doing two things.
384840	389320	One is that it's running on the basis of printing money and sending it to rich people.
389320	395320	Another way to see that is that the economy is actually losing 20 trillion dollars a year
395320	396960	because those are liabilities.
397400	401320	Your stock, you know, when the stock market goes up, you're creating liabilities.
401440	403360	Equity is a liability on a balance sheet.
403680	409040	And so, you know, when basically the total financed value of this financial asset is
409040	413640	increasing, what you're seeing is that basically 20 trillion dollars got created out
413640	417760	of thin air, basically 20 trillion dollars got borrowed out of thin air because those
417760	420640	companies now have to justify, in theory, those valuations.
421000	428080	So in practice, you know, you're looking at this very strange system where if you set
428080	432360	interest rates to basically zero, which is a very strange thing to do, not least because
432360	439560	the valuation of financial assets tends to use equations in which the interest rate is
439560	441120	a denominator.
441240	446640	And so we sort of have with all of the like, wee, free money for everyone.
446640	452240	Everyone's 401k went up, you know, experience of, you know, not just the last two years,
452240	458440	but, you know, before this latest, but more like the last, you know, I mean, since
458440	464800	Allen Greenspan, right, you're basically watching the sort of huge red ink factory and
464800	471120	you're seeing a nation that is basically living pretty much on debt, like a very rich
471120	473200	person who's so rich that he can just keep borrowing.
473600	479720	And so, you know, that sort of experience of a nation living on debt sort of does a
479720	480480	couple of things.
480520	484920	That's obviously very destructive to the real economy, not that there is much of a
484920	491760	real economy left, but, you know, it does a lot of damage to the real economy, but
491760	498720	also from a financial perspective, it causes all assets to basically you have to, you
498720	500480	know, move, you can't just hold cash.
500480	504880	You have to move your money around in such a way that it benefits from this, you know,
504880	506280	beneficent force.
506280	512680	And so it basically makes everything want to get out of cold dollars into things like,
512680	516800	you know, index funds, you know, we have this interesting concept of passive investing,
516800	521080	which is in total defiance of all economic theory, you know, the reason you invest is
521080	526800	that you're adding value to the market, right, or you're lending, but like passive
526840	531360	investing is like, you know, we, I have an index funded, it magically goes up.
531680	533680	And everyone can somehow make a profit off of that.
533680	533960	Right, right, right.
533960	538160	And so basically, like, you know, but the one thing money doesn't want to be is just
538160	542760	playing cold dollars, because just playing cold dollars don't participate in this, except
542760	548000	in the event of the expansion motor turns off when the whole thing begins to rapidly
548000	551320	collapse as, you know, it's done a bit of this year.
551680	556320	And then you really want to be holding cold, cold, hard cash, which brings us perhaps to
556320	558720	another topic, which is a competitor money.
558760	559720	Yes, exactly.
559720	566240	And so, and so, you know, the ability to, you know, just the fact of the dollar
566240	573160	supply inflating inflates the potential demand, assuming even just assuming sort of constant
573200	576360	influx for this other money.
576600	580720	And so basically, what you're seeing is you're seeing that the whole dollar system,
580720	585120	when it's expanding like this, and it needs to expand because the economy is losing
585120	588840	money, you need to like, to generate consumer spending, you need to be printing new
588840	591440	money by giving it to boomers and their retirement accounts.
591800	592160	Right.
592160	600360	And so, you know, if this system, like, I mean, like, it can't like what you're
600360	603480	seeing right now, for example, with the fed raising interest rates and creating a
603480	609240	recession, it's like, basically, there's a sort of a game of chicken, like how hard
609240	614800	can they do this before, like, they realize that, I mean, they see another 2008,
614880	615400	right?
615560	620680	And if they see another 2008 in the presence of inflation, are they going to
620680	624720	chicken out and just say, you know what, actually, Putin did the inflation, we can
624720	628320	correct the numbers, we'll add a Putin, you know, fudge factor, right, and the real
628320	632120	inflation will be, you know, 1% again, because it's like, Putin is not included.
632360	632640	Right.
632920	633760	There's something like that.
633760	634120	I don't know.
634320	639960	But, but the, like, can they get out, you know, it's a hard problem for the fed
639960	644160	because they have this dictum of like, affecting consumer prices.
644200	645440	It's really, it's just a mess.
645440	647640	The point is, this thing loses money.
648080	652440	And to take something that structurally loses money and say, okay, you're
652440	655240	going to run at break even is really, really hard.
655240	655480	Right.
655680	660920	So you can basically bet that this attempt to raise interest rates is going
660920	663400	to fail and fail reasonably hard.
663480	663760	Okay.
664320	664560	Okay.
664560	669400	So that said, I do have invest investment advice for right now for everyone out
669400	675400	there, you know, there's a current, it's a, it's a, it's, it's, it's the dollar.
675600	676560	It's, it's cash.
676680	677680	I recommend cash.
677800	678240	Interesting.
678240	681320	Even though, even though you just went through how it's, it's, it's
681320	684880	Yeah, I, but, but I, but I don't think we've exactly hit that wall yet.
684960	685320	Right.
685320	685360	Okay.
685360	686000	Fair enough.
686000	690840	And so when things are contracting, you know, basically cash is a great
690840	695080	investment because everything is going to contract relative to cash, including
695080	695600	Bitcoin.
695600	699800	And this basically leads us to the sort of the point of like, what causes these
699800	703960	crypto, you know, winter is Uncle Yarev, you know, and don't they suck?
703960	710040	Yeah, they kind of suck, but they suck because they suck for people who basically
710040	710600	deserve it.
710640	715840	So like, you know, I think one thing that many people have said is it's like the
715840	718960	sort of, you know, the Bitcoin holders and the Bitcoin tourists.
718960	721960	And, you know, when crypto winter comes, the tourists depart.
722240	726400	And what a tourist really is, is someone who's not actually saving in Bitcoin.
726640	728960	For example, he's borrowing dollars to buy Bitcoin.
729360	729840	Right.
729840	731280	That is not saving in Bitcoin.
731280	733080	That is speculating on Bitcoin.
733080	738040	And that makes him basically a weak hand because if Bitcoin goes down, he's
738040	739320	going to get it as margin called.
739600	739960	Okay.
740080	742440	So you're not, so you, you do not save in Bitcoin.
743960	748840	No, saving in Bitcoin is like basically being a naked long Bitcoin.
749320	750560	But a lot of people do that now.
750680	751040	Yes.
751040	754640	A lot of people do that now, but a lot, a lot of other people will do things like,
754960	755880	oh, I'll have Bitcoin.
755880	758000	I'll like lend it to someone for a yield.
758000	758360	Right.
758560	762160	You know, so you have this, have or, you know, have this whole sort of fake
762160	768280	DeFi economy where, you know, just like, wow, I see a lot of lenders, but no borrowers.
768360	775000	Like, and when you see a like financial system with like lenders and no borrowers,
775040	777440	like you're like, oh, I see, right?
777440	779640	You know, and, and, um,
781120	787160	you know, like it's, it's, uh, I mean, you know, that white powder on under your
787160	788520	nose could be salt, right?
788520	790960	You know, but okay.
790960	791240	Okay.
791240	795800	So, so money is the bubble that doesn't pop, right?
795840	799920	Pops, it's a bubble, but it could also not pop and then it could become money.
800080	800360	Right.
800360	801480	It's a contingent outcome.
801480	807000	And so there's a world in which basically, you know, the, um, world's stock
807000	809160	markets sort of turn into more and more of a mess.
809160	813440	For example, they just start like going down permanently the way Japan's
813440	817200	did for 30 years, like the Nikkei peaked in the 1880s.
817520	827080	Um, and so, you know, you have, um, it could be that we hit a recession so hard
827080	831920	and so like more abundant that actually you get to the sort of Japanese level
831920	835400	where even zero entry, you get the zero bound problem as they call it.
835640	840040	You know, which is that you basically, no one wants to borrow because everything
840040	844400	is contracting and, um, then you're like, wow, we could pay people to borrow money
844400	846680	and like crazy shit like that starts happening.
846680	853600	You're really, so the point is that, that there's a lot of, um, there, the scenario
853600	861240	under which the monetization of Bitcoin or possibly a competing currency, uh,
861280	867880	continues is it requires savings to keep flowing in that direction.
868160	873000	And what we see in the crypto, these crypto crashes is that basically all of
873000	877080	the weak hands not only get flushed out, but get like, you know, they will never
877080	880120	sit, you know, it's like Mark Twain said, you know, a cat that sits down
880120	882640	on a hot stove will never sit down on a cold stove again either.
882920	883240	Right.
883240	885880	You know, and, and these people are gone.
886320	889680	Um, but also the price does appreciate over time.
890440	894520	Every cycle, there's a few more hotellers at it who seem sustainable.
894520	894960	Yes.
895120	895520	Yes.
895520	899240	And, and the question, but, but of course, when you look at that, you have
899240	905320	to say, well, you know, is there a limit on the kind of people who would do this?
905560	912680	Can this break out of the libertarian nutcase savings pool can, um, so, you
912680	917720	know, there are many, many credible situations under which, you know,
917720	923520	Bitcoin does not become money after all, you know, of course, you know, for
923520	928920	example, you look at the health of the exchanges out there, uh, that's kind
928920	930600	of a double-edged sword on the one hand.
930600	935360	These are big businesses that can afford to pay protection money to Washington,
935360	936000	which they do.
936240	942440	On the other hand, basically if some agency somewhere passes an order tomorrow
943400	949560	that says banks can't talk to crypto exchanges, think about what happens.
950000	953000	Basically no one can sell the crypto.
953280	953560	Right.
953560	955160	If you have, there's no price.
955160	958880	And if you have no price, you're worth zero.
958880	961800	And you instantly go to basically the zero equilibrium.
961880	963920	So this is something you've been writing about for many years now.
963920	964840	Since you first started up.
964840	969800	Yeah, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just like, you know, on the one hand in a purely
970000	977080	abstract private sector, you know, um, version of the standardization problem
977080	981240	with like perfect information, with perfect information, everybody realizes
981240	983760	what everyone else should do tomorrow and does it today.
984080	986880	And, you know, it sort of happens instantaneously.
987080	987560	Right.
987600	993960	And, um, so obviously we don't live in the world of perfect information and we
993960	995560	live in a very, very imperfect world.
995560	999080	I was actually, when I realized sort of the game theory, I was like, wow, if I
999120	1002840	like post about this, like this could happen like tomorrow, but, uh, you know,
1002920	1005960	we don't live in the stock market is not a superintelligence.
1006440	1013000	You know, and, and, and so you actually have this sort of long, complicated.
1013440	1016200	It's essentially sort of meme warfare, right?
1016200	1021280	You know, because the only thing that differentiates Bitcoin from
1021600	1026160	to a random Bitcoin fork, which you can start tomorrow is basically the
1026200	1028600	memetic weight of being the standard.
1029000	1034360	And it's like the problem with trying to overthrow that is, you know, let's
1034360	1037960	say you have Ethereum, which is, um, you know, going to have with proof of
1037960	1042360	stake, a lower inflation rate, a lower sort of rate of like minor is creating
1042360	1043840	coins that they have to sell.
1044200	1049320	So, you know, minor is creating coins that they have to sell to buy electricity.
1049680	1051720	Is it sort of natural sorts of sellers?
1052080	1056680	If you don't have a natural, like, you know, a pool of four sellers, you
1056680	1060040	know, your, uh, your levitation effect will be better.
1060040	1062800	So maybe that's a case for Ethereum overtaking Bitcoin.
1063200	1065760	There's a world in which that could, that could certainly happen.
1065760	1073320	On the other hand, it's like the sort of standardization, like once
1073320	1078400	that's happened, sort of like the standardization power of the number two
1078440	1082160	is sort of then even weaker against like the number three and the number four.
1082560	1091800	And so, you know, and, and, and people who, I don't think there has yet been,
1093280	1100360	like the market understands that whatever the mysterious cause of the
1100360	1103800	valuation of these coins, it has something to do with being a store,
1104200	1105120	store of value.
1105560	1112040	Um, and what they don't really understand is sort of, it's really hard
1112040	1116040	to convey the sort of very simple game theory of that, which is just why
1116320	1121760	think about how much stronger the whole argument would be if simply if Bitcoin
1121760	1124800	and Ethereum were a single store of value, if they were not competing
1124800	1126360	for that role, right?
1126360	1130280	Because the competition makes either of them more unstable because then you
1130280	1135040	have to accept the probability that one will lose to the other in addition
1135040	1140160	to the probability that crypto as a whole will fail to dominate the world.
