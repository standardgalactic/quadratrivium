0	23000	All right, everybody. Thank you so much for coming out. This is a really interesting, unique event.
24000	31000	There are people here who have flown here from different states. There's like more than five people who flew here just for this.
31000	32000	Wow.
32000	35000	And it's not just, thank you, man. I appreciate that.
35000	42000	Of course, that's flattering, but thanks, man. We might need that about one hour in.
42000	48000	And you know, that's very flattering and all, but I'm not crazy. No one's flying several hours because of me.
48000	52000	I mean, I'm pretty fucking smart and cool, but I'm not that smart and cool.
52000	55000	But you're sweet, Justin. You're very sweet.
55000	56000	Well, thank you, Curtis.
56000	57000	I appreciate that.
57000	72000	The reason I'm commenting on this before we even begin is because people really need to understand that there is an extraordinary demand out there for true, radical, dangerous, intellectual thought and expression and discussion.
72000	81000	And there is an unfortunately constrained supply. There's an artificially constrained supply of true intellectual life.
81000	87000	And people should not have to fly hundreds of miles to come listen to someone like Curtis Talk.
87000	91000	There is a huge demand for it. It's not being met.
91000	96000	And if, unfortunately, the way things are working out right now is if you want this kind of thing, you have to make it yourself.
96000	101000	DIY, baby. Punk rock culture, dude. Get a venue where you live.
101000	104000	Put on things like this. You know, the institutions aren't going to do it for you.
104000	106000	Academics aren't going to do it for you.
106000	119000	Almost everyone out there right now who is kind of representing some sort of intellectual posture, let's be honest, about 90, at least 90% of them are utterly fake, absolute, absolute fakers.
119000	124000	And if you want real intellectual life, no one's going to give it to you necessarily.
124000	125000	But if you build it, they will come.
125000	128000	Look at this. I'm not that famous, people.
128000	130000	Like, I'm really not. I do not have that big of a following.
130000	134000	And yet I do this little event and people will fly across states.
134000	137000	So my exhortation, I want to start essentially with an exhortation.
137000	143000	If you think this is cool, if you enjoy this talk, if you were excited to come to this and if it lives up even halfway to what you wanted it to be,
143000	150000	the type of intellectual kind of community or dialogue, the exciting kind of dangerous, edgy intellectual experience that you want it to be,
150000	156000	which I think Curtis and I are both committed to making it that for you, then go home and do it yourselves.
156000	160000	Provide this for the other people around you. People should not have to fly this far just to be a part of this.
160000	162000	So that's just a little exhortation.
162000	167000	Fortunately, you're watching this on YouTube in porn mode.
167000	173000	You can hit record now. We're going to start. We're good? You sure? Okay, cool.
173000	178000	So, okay, that's my little exhortation because people should not have to fly this far to be a part of something like this.
178000	183000	Welcome to this little event that we've put on. This is my first live show of my podcast.
183000	189000	The podcast is called Other Life, and it's pretty much all about me trying to find true intellectual life wherever it exists.
189000	191000	Today, that mostly means on the Internet.
191000	201000	So most of the people I interview for my podcast are bloggers, kind of strange, interesting, unique, idiosyncratic, and very courageous people, typically.
201000	209000	We're just weird people who are out there pursuing some type of independent intellectual life that is escaping this kind of institutional apparatus
209000	214000	that is so constraining so many people nowadays. That's what my podcast is all about.
214000	217000	That's why it's called Other Life. It's about a different kind of life.
217000	223000	I started it when I was an academic, and I needed to find people to actually talk about interesting, real stuff with.
223000	227000	So that's my podcast, Other Life, and this is the first time I'm doing a live show.
227000	231000	So, yeah, this is a milestone for me, and I'm very happy to have you all here.
231000	240000	Enough on general introductions. I would like to now introduce our special guest here tonight, Curtis Jarvin, a.k.a. Menchist Moldbug.
240000	247000	And I'm going to pick his brain about many things. I have some questions that were actually submitted to me by other people.
247000	248000	Fuck.
250000	255000	But Curtis has told me anything goes. He's told me, you know, there's nothing off limits.
255000	259000	Luckily, I'm a fairly friendly interviewer. I don't have any hard balls for you to plan.
259000	260000	I'll be thinking that now.
261000	266000	So, I'll give you a little bit of introduction. Most of you are here, you probably already know.
266000	269000	Curtis is shtick, but what I think is most...
269000	270000	Good word.
271000	277000	Come on in, guys. What I think is most, you know, Curtis is mostly known for being a reactionary blogger,
277000	280000	and of course, a brilliant startup founder.
280000	285000	But in these circles, you're probably kind of most known for being a rather reactionary blogger.
285000	290000	What I think is kind of most interesting about you, Curtis, is not primarily your reactionary qualities,
290000	293000	which are interesting for sure, and we'll get there.
293000	296000	But primarily, you're a computer scientist or an engineer.
296000	299000	What would you say, engineer, or what's the label you would use?
299000	302000	I like to think of myself as a computer programmer.
302000	306000	Computer programmer. There you go. Old school. I like the modesty.
306000	310000	And so, I tend to see your writings mostly through that lens.
310000	316000	I see you as your blog, which we're going to kind of dissect over the next hour or two.
316000	317000	Shit.
319000	324000	To me, the defining characteristic of your worldview and your political theory is not so much your reactionary qualities,
324000	330000	but I see your reactionary qualities as kind of downstream of your engineer mentality
330000	335000	or your computer programming type of mentality and experience.
335000	342000	I see you as, Curtis likes to, I think, kind of hack into the source code of a lot of conventional wisdom,
342000	345000	in particular, kind of the politically correct wisdom.
345000	351000	And then once he's kind of hacked into your source code, he wants to bring you places that maybe you don't necessarily want to go,
351000	353000	but he wants to kind of lure you there.
353000	357000	Yeah, that's a fairly insightful comment, Justin.
357000	362000	I would say something a little close to that, which is just that I like to think from first principles.
362000	366000	And so, when I see a large system or a complicated system, I'm like,
366000	370000	okay, what would this look like if you designed it from scratch?
370000	372000	Clearly, this is a product of history.
372000	376000	It's spent a lot of time evolving.
376000	381000	As I record, there's a lot of Americans concerned about the 401Ks.
381000	383000	And so, I'm like, what is this stock market thing?
383000	384000	Where did this come from?
384000	385000	How does this work?
385000	388000	This is a very interesting kind of question to me.
388000	393000	And I think that approach can be used by a lot of people for a lot of different things.
393000	394000	Excellent.
394000	397000	So, my intuition there is not wrong.
397000	398000	Mostly.
398000	399000	Okay.
399000	401000	So, I think that's enough of an introduction.
401000	408000	He's a computer programmer, a well-known blogger, and a founder of an enigmatic startup called Herbit,
408000	413000	which we might have some time to get into a little bit, too, now that you've formally walked away from Herbit.
413000	417000	I think, are you now a little bit more free to discuss it, or?
417000	418000	Yeah.
418000	421000	I mean, I'm a little bit more free, but I'm also more distant from it.
421000	426000	So, what I say should not be taken as gospel.
426000	429000	Anyone can read my resignation letter.
429000	436000	And I'm using the enough sort of unusually for Silicon Valley, everything I wrote in that is true.
436000	437000	Cool.
437000	438000	Great.
438000	440000	Then, I don't think you need much more of a warm-up.
440000	445000	I think we can get right into the interesting stuff that people are probably here to hear you talk about.
445000	450000	I see you as very interested in, well, you're kind of a pill dispenser, aren't you?
450000	451000	Yeah, sort of.
451000	457000	You like dispensing pills, whether they be red pills or most recently, clear pill is a recent idea you have.
457000	458000	Yeah.
458000	464000	I have questions about that as a marketing concept, but I'm pretty sincere about it.
464000	465000	Right.
465000	466000	I take that as sincere.
466000	471000	In fact, to my understanding, you actually popularized the term red pill in the political context.
471000	472000	Is that right?
472000	473000	Yeah, that's actually true.
473000	480000	I can tell you actually where I was when I came up with that, which is in the Haydashbury at Hayden Masonic.
480000	490000	I was in the People's Cafe, and the People's Cafe is the decor in the People's Cafe is entirely like 60s revolutionary stickers.
490000	493000	So, you know, it's a very kind of positive place.
493000	501000	And, you know, to those who have seen the Matrix, obviously, you know, it's obvious that, you know, the red pill is this kind of left-wing, you know, analogy.
501000	505000	You know, what if you made it a right-wing one? Wouldn't that be interesting?
505000	506000	Right.
506000	513000	So what I thought would be a good exercise to kick things off is maybe you could dispense a kind of pill right now.
513000	515000	And I was thinking, I was thinking a really...
515000	516000	Can you be more specific?
516000	517000	Yeah.
517000	521000	I was thinking a really good place to start would be on the concept of democracy.
521000	522000	Oh, sure.
522000	523000	Okay.
523000	527000	You know, let's talk about democracy for a second.
527000	530000	You know, I actually have a nice little line prepared on that.
530000	536000	Which is, you know, people are very fond on Twitter and so forth of these political quadrants.
536000	545000	And one way you can draw a political quadrant is to say, you can ask two questions, you know, is your country a democracy?
545000	547000	And should it be a democracy?
547000	556000	So the set of people who answer no to both of those questions, that's a relatively small set.
556000	558000	And it's a pretty freaking weird set.
558000	562000	So, yeah, I'm kind of part of that set.
562000	563000	So that's my perspective.
563000	574000	The reason I wanted to start with democracy as a good test case is because it's arguably one of the most universally applauded concepts or values right now in kind of mainstream culture, right?
574000	580000	Well, I was going to stop you before you said, you know, right now, actually, it's pretty much universally reviled.
580000	587000	But it's only universally reviled if you consider all historical periods as equal.
587000	591000	Right, for most of the history of the term, it was a bad thing.
591000	595000	Yeah, because people, you know, saw, you know, the history of Athens and so forth.
595000	602000	And, you know, the history of Athens basically is an independent principality basically ends with democracy.
602000	606000	And, you know, the history of the Roman Republic ends in a very turbulent way.
606000	607000	Right.
607000	608000	And so, you know, who's it?
608000	614000	You know, John Adams, you know, the greatest American political philosopher, of course, second president.
614000	619000	I'm trying to recall his words on democracy verbatim.
619000	623000	But, you know, he's like, you know, this is the worst political system ever.
623000	634000	And this is one of the founders of, you know, like the main philosopher of, you know, the main person who's kind of political writing still holds up from the American founding.
634000	635000	Yes, that's right.
635000	640000	I mean, for most of the history of the term democracy, it essentially means what we now think of as something like anarchy.
640000	643000	They're just kind of seen as synonymous with chaos, something to be avoided.
643000	649000	Or if you're familiar with the word populism, used as a pejorative.
649000	658000	You know, so one simple example that I sometimes use is, let's take two words, politics and democracy.
658000	667000	So you'll notice that when you think about those words, you have very different associations with either.
667000	671000	So suppose you were to say, oh, we're going to politicize this.
671000	673000	We're going to politicize U.S. foreign policy.
673000	675000	We're going to politicize the State Department.
675000	677000	We're going to politicize the coronavirus.
677000	679000	That's clearly a very bad thing to do.
679000	684000	But if you're going to democratize this, you know, if you're going to bring democracy to China or whatever,
684000	687000	wasn't there that great Guns N' Roses album, Chinese Democracy?
687000	688000	Can you buy that in China?
688000	696000	You know, I sometimes wonder, oh, man, so, you know, if you're going to democratize something, you know, there's absolutely no question
696000	701000	that democracy has a completely positive set of associations.
701000	705000	And politics, you know, like office politics is bad.
705000	707000	You know, anything political is bad.
707000	712000	And yet you look at these two words and you're like, wait, they're synonyms.
712000	714000	But one of them is good and one of them is bad.
714000	721000	You know, and if you can explain that, you know, basically, I don't think you have any need for any of my pills.
721000	727000	It's almost like in your grand narrative, democracy is sort of the root of all problems in some sense.
727000	729000	Oh, that would be going too far.
729000	737000	I mean, you know, democracy is a very legitimate, it's one of the many, like one of the three basic political systems.
737000	743000	And, you know, as a political system, even more, it's basically a form of political energy.
743000	747000	You know, even in a country like you're in the Soviet Union, there's no real democracy.
747000	749000	Maybe there are fake elections.
749000	752000	But you can say, does democratic power still exist?
752000	757000	Of course it does, because it's what overthrew or what helped overthrow the Soviet Union.
757000	762000	So, you know, this basic force never, at least abstractly, disappears.
762000	768000	And no one, certainly no one has refuted the categorization of Aristotle into three political systems.
768000	774000	Democracy, rule of the many, oligarchy, rule of the few, and monarchy, rule of the one.
774000	780000	Real quick, not to digress too much, but when was the last time you did a public talk, IRL?
780000	782000	2012.
782000	784000	2012, without being cancelled.
784000	790000	Oh, without being cancelled. Well, I did a, no, I mean, I did, I've done technical talks like once or twice.
790000	795000	But, yeah, I've never, you know, I don't usually do public appearances, so I'm kind of a virgin here.
795000	797000	Okay, interesting.
797000	798000	Okay.
798000	802000	You'll have to excuse me if I feel, seem a little nervous and weird.
802000	809000	No, no, you seem great. I was only asking because I'm kind of, I'm thinking a lot lately about kind of the shifting tides of the culture wars.
809000	814000	It seems to me that something like this would maybe not have even been possible a year ago.
814000	819000	The protest energy might have been too great, threats of having it shut down or whatever the case might be.
819000	826000	Whereas now I have this kind of sense that, personally, that we're kind of turning a corner, where this type of thing is now more possible.
826000	828000	I was just curious if you have any similar type of intuition.
828000	841000	Well, you know, that may be true in a sense. You know, the one thing that I try really hard to do that has been sort of the perennial kind of, if I may use the term, shit show.
841000	854000	The last three years is that I feel like a lot of people, when they create, you know, heterodox content, you know, the word, do you know the origin of the word trolling, by the way?
854000	855000	Not sure that I do.
855000	858000	Let me tell you the origin of the word trolling, then I'll tell you why I don't troll.
858000	864000	The origin of the word trolling, first of all, if you've ever, has anyone ever trolled, you know, in fishing?
864000	869000	Any fishermen in the room? I can see, okay, yeah, that's good.
869000	874000	Yeah, you have slowly from the back of the boat, you're dragging basically this lure, right?
874000	879000	I have trolled, I have fished for bass, you know, it's lower class to fish for bass, which is why I like it.
879000	885000	And, you know, like, people of quality fish for trout, and they certainly don't troll.
885000	892000	Nonetheless, the word trolling, as we use it now, was actually a product of the Vietnam War.
892000	893000	Did you notice?
893000	894000	I did not.
894000	908000	So what it was invented, you know, with a clear analogy to the fishing practice, basically US, what were called wild weasels, which were like an F-104, I think, outfitted with some kind of electronic intercept category,
908000	921000	basically fly across surface to air missile sites in North Vietnam, trying to get surface to air missiles shot at them, so they could basically lock onto the launchers and destroy them with counter missiles.
921000	926000	So anytime you're thinking of the word trolling, you should be like, where are my radar seeking missiles?
926000	932000	And if you're just like out there basically trying to attract fire, you're just, you should really question why you're doing this.
932000	936000	And of course that question could be asked about the whole Vietnam War, right?
936000	950000	And so, you know, when people basically go, you know, there were like, if you remember in like an early 2017, there were like these, like, provocations in Berkeley, like these Antifa Breitbart riots, you know, it seems like something from like the 15th century now.
950000	958000	You know, the whole thing, you know, was really quite, it was very larpy, if you know the term, it was very kind of pretend.
958000	971000	And the thing that I dislike about it most, and the one thing that I would basically caution all heterodox thinkers about is that the one thing you really don't want to do is inhabit the stereotypes of your opponents.
971000	979000	So basically, you have, you know, anyone who's kind of, you know, working in some direction has people working against them, right?
979000	984000	And those people who are working against you see you as a certain kind of person.
984000	988000	They imagine, oh, this is what our enemies are like.
988000	1004000	And because their frame is so dominant, it's really easy to inhabit that caricature, because basically you've been taught by them, oh, this is what, you know, our enemies are like, they believe this, they believe that, they do this, they do that.
1004000	1015000	And if you basically get that so deeply into your head that you're like, you know, oh, I oppose you, I do this, I do that, you don't really have your own frame, you're still operating in their frame.
1015000	1022000	And you're operating in a way which is much more valuable to them than if you even supported them.
1022000	1029000	So was this type of strategy behind your blog, Unqualified Reservations, were you thinking about these things proactively when you first set out to do that blog?
1029000	1034000	No, it was crazy. I should never have written anything at all.
1034000	1037000	Do you mean that? You don't mean that.
1037000	1046000	There's part of me that means that, but there's part of me that doesn't. You know, when I think about the problem of being a dissident, I'm always reminded.
1046000	1048000	Do you know the writer, Rizard Kapozynski?
1048000	1049000	I don't.
1049000	1053000	He was, he wrote mainly in the 80s and 90s, I think he died in the early 2000s.
1053000	1059000	He was a journalist and he was a correspondent for the official Polish Communist News Agency.
1059000	1065000	And fortunately for him, he was also an amazing writer and he got sent to Africa.
1065000	1070000	So Africa is kind of relatively tangentially related to Polish communism.
1070000	1077000	So he could not really exactly write whatever he wanted, but he could be pretty, he could write stuff that was actually worthwhile content.
1077000	1083000	There's some controversy over whether there's any actual truth in his books or whether they're just wholly made up.
1083000	1086000	But even if they're wholly made up, they're pretty good.
1086000	1091000	And so he wrote this, but one book called The Emperor, which is about Ethiopia.
1091000	1096000	And so he went to Ethiopia and everyone's here has heard of Haile Selassie, right?
1096000	1098000	You know, like from like Bob Marley songs or something.
1098000	1102000	So Haile Selassie was this emperor of Ethiopia and he was kind of a nutcase.
1102000	1105000	He had pet lions, he used to feed descendants to the lions.
1105000	1107000	It was a little weird.
1107000	1119000	And so eventually it was sort of weird enough and what we now call civil society, you know, got started to kind of organize against him and, you know, he was overthrown.
1119000	1121000	The same thing happens, it always happens.
1121000	1129000	He was overthrown by the liberals and then the liberals got stabbed in the back by the committed Marxist Leninists and they established this regime called the Derg,
1129000	1132000	which was about 100 times worse than Haile Selassie ever was.
1132000	1144000	But so in the early days of the Derg, Richard Kapasinski, this Polish journalist, goes to Ethiopia and he interviews all kinds of people who are basically part of the old regime.
1145000	1153000	Ethiopia, you know, as you may or may not know, is in some ways more of a Middle Eastern country than an African country.
1153000	1155000	And it has this, it's a Christian country.
1155000	1157000	It has this very old nobility and this very old elite.
1157000	1163000	And so these people were, you know, the former employees of Haile Selassie.
1163000	1173000	So there's this one interview from this book or maybe completely fake interview, I don't really know, that sticks in my mind where he goes and interviews a couple who are part of this old regime.
1174000	1183000	That's government service class who have basically had a son who has become a dissident and subsequently comes to, of course, a very bad end.
1183000	1190000	And he's interviewing this couple and he's like, you know, tell me when you first suspected that there might be a problem.
1190000	1198000	And, you know, the wife was like, well, you know, one day my husband came to me and he was like, we have a problem.
1198000	1199000	What is the problem?
1199000	1204000	The problem is Tesfaye, their son, Tesfaye has started to think.
1204000	1225000	And as a parent, I really relate to that, you know, and, you know, in a way like, you know, the, you know, anyone who is interested in actually getting ahead or succeeding in this world would be very well advised not to think.
1225000	1230000	And if they start thinking they should, you know, and I'm serious about this, they should keep it to themselves.
1230000	1235000	You know, they should hide, you know, there's a great term hide your power level, hide your power level.
1235000	1244000	By all means, you know, if you start thinking, don't be like a 15 year old Ethiopian boy who's going to end up being shot in a month and a half.
1245000	1252000	And so, you know, that's, I think, certainly, you know, is a valid perspective.
1252000	1262000	You know, on the other hand, you know, you know, what was this line of Shaw, you know, a reasonable person adapts himself to society.
1262000	1266000	An unreasonable person insists on adapting the world to himself.
1266000	1269000	Therefore, all progress depends on unreasonable people.
1270000	1274000	And what about people who are cursed with this drive or this necessity to think?
1274000	1280000	Well, you know, there's a great line. There's another writer I really adore, which is the writer Freda Utley.
1280000	1286000	So she was writing in the 30s and 40s and she was a communist.
1286000	1288000	She was a communist in the 30s.
1288000	1292000	In the 30s, basically anyone who was smart or cool was a communist.
1292000	1296000	The list of smart, cool people who were not communists is an interesting list.
1296000	1297000	Otherwise, they were communists.
1298000	1311000	And so, Ellie was a communist and she was so committed to the cause that she went and married a Russian, you know, a bright young Russian guy who was, you know, part of the revolution and actually moves to Russia with him.
1311000	1319000	And she moves to Russia with him and then in, like, their mid-30s, then shit goes bad.
1319000	1322000	He disappears into the gulag. She never hears from him again.
1322000	1324000	And she has, like, a baby son.
1325000	1332000	So she comes back to the U.S. and she has all these chic friends, right?
1332000	1335000	Because communism has always been this very, very chic movement.
1335000	1339000	And she's like, friends, help me.
1339000	1342000	Like, because the Soviet Union really cares.
1342000	1344000	I bet it's friends, bro. Sorry.
1344000	1350000	And, you know, of course, her friends are just like, do I know you?
1351000	1354000	Do I know this person? Who is this anti-Soviet person who's knocking on my door?
1354000	1356000	They're like, fuck you.
1356000	1361000	And so, you know, of course, she gets nowhere with this, right?
1361000	1362000	Sorry.
1362000	1368000	And, you know, she goes and talks to her friend, Edith Hamilton.
1368000	1373000	You know, Edith Hamilton, the great writer and mythology, great 30s writer.
1373000	1378000	She talks to Edith Hamilton and she's like, why are all my friends like stabbing me in the back?
1380000	1388000	And Edith Hamilton is like, well, you know, you really shouldn't expect the material rewards of success
1388000	1393000	to come along with the spiritual rewards of telling the truth.
1393000	1394000	You shouldn't expect that.
1394000	1395000	And I think that's true today.
1395000	1397000	And you've experienced that, right, Justin?
1397000	1399000	I'll let you talk for a sec.
1399000	1400000	Yeah, sure.
1400000	1401000	So you're...
1401000	1403000	I mean, you know, I think it's possible.
1403000	1406000	You know, one thing you didn't do, Justin, was introduce yourself.
1406000	1412000	And I think it's possible that there may be some people watching who might know who I am, but don't know who you are.
1412000	1416000	I wouldn't be so presumptuous to introduce myself.
1416000	1417000	I mean, you can if you want.
1417000	1418000	All right.
1418000	1421000	Well, you know, unfortunately, I don't know that much about you.
1421000	1423000	But what I know is...
1423000	1426000	Let me just say what I know about Mr. Murphy.
1426000	1427000	I can if you want.
1427000	1428000	No, I'll tell you what I know.
1428000	1431000	So, you know, Justin Murphy is a...
1431000	1434000	I would describe him as a defrocked academic.
1434000	1435000	Is that right?
1435000	1437000	I take issue with that.
1440000	1442000	They couldn't fire me because I quit, baby.
1442000	1444000	Yeah, yeah, it sounds right.
1444000	1446000	I was about to be defrocked, yes.
1446000	1451000	But I'm a proud Irish Catholic man, and I just didn't want to give him that pleasure.
1451000	1456000	Many people advised me, actually, to let them fire me, let them go through with the...
1456000	1457000	I would have advised you that.
1457000	1458000	The big stink.
1458000	1459000	I believe you did.
1459000	1460000	I believe you emailed me, actually.
1460000	1462000	I called the email to you, actually.
1462000	1466000	Yeah, so I thought long and hard about it, but I decided, ultimately,
1466000	1469000	and this is the only thing that's actually interesting about my case.
1469000	1473000	It's not me, per se, but what I do think is interesting about my particular case
1473000	1477000	is my phenomenology of going through this conflict,
1477000	1479000	my kind of cost-benefit calculus at the time.
1479000	1482000	I was a professor for six years, a successful professor.
1482000	1483000	I'm a political scientist by training.
1483000	1486000	I was based in England at the University of Southampton.
1486000	1488000	And I was doing very well.
1488000	1490000	Everything was going pretty much according to plan.
1490000	1492000	Are you still a Red Brick University?
1492000	1494000	Yes, that's right, as a matter of fact.
1494000	1501000	And pretty much I bought into this myth that I was always kind of conducting my life on,
1501000	1505000	which was that if I play by the rules in academia and I publish in good journals
1505000	1509000	and I climb the ranks and I establish myself and prove myself and get tenure,
1509000	1511000	I had the British version of tenure, I was set.
1511000	1514000	Then, finally, there would come a time when I could speak freely,
1514000	1516000	where I could really do what I want and I could be free.
1516000	1518000	My advisors, that's what my PhD advisors always told me.
1518000	1522000	That's what I thought from the day that I set out to pursue an academic career.
1522000	1526000	And I guess I was the only person stupid enough to actually take that promise, literally.
1526000	1527000	I mean, I'm not kidding.
1527000	1531000	Once I really got arrived, I got the British version of tenure,
1531000	1533000	I had good publications in top journals.
1533000	1535000	I literally said to myself pretty consciously,
1535000	1537000	okay, now I'm going to start being free.
1537000	1538000	I started the podcast.
1538000	1541000	I'm like, I'm going to actually start blogging about whatever I want.
1541000	1543000	I'm going to start talking about whatever I want.
1543000	1545000	I'm going to really let the chips fall where they may,
1545000	1547000	because this whole academic game is only worth it.
1547000	1552000	But paying all of those dues over 10 years or more was only worth it to get that freedom.
1552000	1553000	That's what I was in it for.
1553000	1556000	So I decided to take it and immediately I started getting flack.
1556000	1561000	It was very clear, very apparent that that type of freedom was never going to come.
1561000	1566000	And at the same time, the academic institutions were getting more and more oppressive,
1566000	1569000	more and more annoying, the amounts of paperwork you have to do,
1569000	1571000	the amounts of red tape, the political correctness.
1571000	1574000	All of the costs of being an academic were increasing.
1574000	1578000	At the same time that all of my creative, independent, intellectual work on the internet
1578000	1581000	was gaining more and more traction and it was more and more fun.
1581000	1584000	And the ability to do that freely and independently on the internet
1584000	1588000	seemed to be increasing at the same time that my academic career seemed more and more miserable.
1588000	1592000	So that was when, you know, at that time I'm realizing all of this,
1592000	1596000	you know, when my administrator comes to me and says that I'm not allowed to use the word retard on Twitter,
1596000	1598000	I was like, fuck you, I'm going to say whatever I want on Twitter.
1598000	1601000	And yeah, it was clear that push was going to come to shove.
1601000	1603000	They probably would have pushed me out.
1603000	1605000	But honestly, I just didn't want to deal with the hassle.
1605000	1609000	And I genuinely decided that I had better prospects as, you know,
1609000	1614000	an independent intellectual pursuing a full-time intellectual career for the rest of my life.
1614000	1616000	Because I'm still young. I still have piss and vinegar.
1616000	1619000	I was like, I can carve out a new path. I can make a new model.
1619000	1621000	I think I see it possible.
1621000	1624000	So I was like, peace out. And I decided to do my own thing.
1624000	1626000	I didn't need them to fire me or whatever.
1626000	1628000	That's my little intro about me. Yeah, sure.
1628000	1635000	So kind of my theory, you know, I dropped out of grad school in computer science for somewhat different,
1635000	1637000	but certainly not political reasons.
1637000	1642000	But, you know, I think I came to the same realization as Justin,
1642000	1649000	but somewhat sooner than Justin that, you know,
1649000	1654000	essentially here was this form and this kind of form of science.
1654000	1657000	And, you know, I come into this and I'm like, I take it at face value.
1657000	1659000	I'm like, this is what it appears to be.
1659000	1665000	And then you get in there and you basically discover that you're actually training to be a bureaucrat.
1665000	1669000	And my parents were bureaucrats, so I kind of know the experience pretty well.
1669000	1674000	And I'm like, I'm actually, what I'm trying to do here is make alliances.
1674000	1679000	What I'm trying to do here is make friends who will scratch my back when they scratch theirs.
1679000	1681000	I'm trying to be popular.
1681000	1684000	I'm trying to be on a team player.
1684000	1686000	I'm trying to be with the program.
1686000	1690000	You know, and I'm like, you know, this is like, you know, was, I'm sorry to be arrogant,
1690000	1693000	but was Isaac Newton a team player?
1693000	1698000	Isaac Newton was a weirdo and a nerd and like just an impossible person to deal with.
1698000	1707000	And like science, the kinds of people who created, you know, the science and academia and literature that we know
1707000	1712000	could never have succeeded in these institutions and cannot succeed in these institutions.
1712000	1717000	And unless they have just these amazing talents and I've seen people who can do that,
1717000	1722000	you know, I wouldn't try like political science as crazy, but like computer science, sure.
1722000	1726000	There are people who are amazing computer scientists in a very fundamental sense
1726000	1728000	and also amazing bureaucrats.
1728000	1731000	And those people are very successful and they deserve all the success they get.
1731000	1734000	But they're an exception.
1735000	1736000	Yeah, definitely.
1736000	1743000	So I want to talk about unqualified reservations, your notorious blog that you wrote in the late 2000s.
1743000	1749000	You seem to have some misgivings about ever having gained any type of recognition or readership for your blog.
1749000	1752000	You seem to have mixed emotions. I'm kind of curious about that.
1752000	1760000	Well, you know, it's always very difficult when you have to, I hesitate to say careers, I have zero careers,
1760000	1768000	but the two very different directions you're pursuing because they can easily interfere with each other.
1768000	1773000	It's like one of my favorite, you know, historical figures or artists generally.
1773000	1774000	Do you know Wyndham Lewis?
1774000	1775000	Of course.
1775000	1782000	You know, and so Wyndham Lewis is both, you know, a very, you know, not just a legitimate, really a leading literary figure
1782000	1785000	and also a leading figure in painting.
1785000	1791000	And, you know, his paintings and his literary work are both, all of his writing actually needs editing,
1791000	1793000	but otherwise it's very good.
1793000	1798000	And so, you know, but those careers didn't really interfere with each other.
1798000	1803000	You know, there's another kind of thing that people will do where they make a career in some technical field
1803000	1807000	and then make a shit ton of money, you know, which hasn't actually happened to me.
1807000	1815000	And then, you know, quit and go and be, you know, some kind of intellectual, philosophical, literary figure or whatever,
1815000	1817000	but doing the reverse is very, very difficult.
1817000	1821000	Was the blog in your mind when you set out to write it, was it just for fun,
1821000	1827000	or would you say you had intellectual ambitions to really kind of solve some puzzles around political theory?
1827000	1832000	I would say that I had, you know, certainly intellectual ambitions, but, you know,
1832000	1837000	I have no, well, of course I have no political ambitions,
1837000	1843000	but I also, you know, I was just not really that interested in who would read my blog.
1843000	1847000	In fact, I never even read the comments, which was probably a mistake.
1847000	1854000	And the, you know, I absolutely hate reading about myself in any context whatsoever.
1854000	1858000	And like many neurotic writers.
1858000	1866000	But I was just like, you know, in a way that was, that era was kind of the last gasp of the old Internet way of doing things,
1866000	1872000	where you basically, you know, it's like I started posting on like Usenet in like 1989, right?
1872000	1875000	So, you know, that was, that was some time ago.
1875000	1880000	And, you know, in that world, like the Internet was this weird thing that no one had heard of.
1880000	1888000	And, you know, and like my own project, Urban Today, with which I'm no longer associated.
1888000	1898000	And having being something that no one had heard of provided, it just provided this really nice intellectual quality,
1898000	1901000	because, you know, there was, you could not imagine it mattering.
1901000	1905000	I mean, I remember the first time that I saw the Internet mentioned in the New York Times.
1905000	1908000	It may have been the first time the Internet was mentioned in the New York Times.
1908000	1913000	It was the fall of 1988, and Robert Morris had unleashed the famous Morris Worm.
1913000	1917000	And so you're reading, you're reading New York Times, and then you read about the Internet in New York Times.
1917000	1920000	It's like your cousin was in the New York Times, right?
1920000	1929000	You write a lot about this, actually, how you're very specifically resigned from any type of, trying to have political efficacy of any kind.
1929000	1932000	You write about this throughout unqualified reservations.
1932000	1934000	You say this frequently.
1934000	1943000	And do you think that that's actually a kind of necessary precondition for pursuing a real kind of long-term original creative intellectual project in some sense?
1943000	1945000	Absolutely.
1945000	1950000	You know, and let me, in a way, turn that question back on you.
1950000	1955000	I would say that, you know, you can't really be free.
1955000	1958000	Can I get all Buddhist on you?
1958000	1959000	What's that?
1959000	1960000	Can I get all Buddhist on you?
1960000	1961000	Yeah, go for it, man.
1961000	1965000	You can't really be free until you free yourself from desire, man.
1965000	1981000	And so the, and to free yourself from, you know, one of my big things, if, you know, those of you who've read my latest series, The Clear Pill, featured in the Claremont Institute's American Mind,
1981000	1986000	people have been, my editors have been yammering at me for part three for about four months.
1986000	1988000	I'm working on it.
1989000	2002000	And so, you know, one of the things that I really tend to focus on is this word, themos, which is a Greek word that can be translated in a number of ways.
2002000	2006000	I think the simplest translation is ambition.
2006000	2014000	But, you know, in Plato, you see this explicit parallel between themos and eros, eros being, of course, sexual desire.
2014000	2022000	And so desire for power and desire for sex have always been, you know, very, very closely related, especially if you're Harvey Weinstein.
2022000	2033000	And these are like, you know, these were always, you know, now, of course, we, you know, the received wisdom has never turned down money, sex, or power.
2033000	2037000	But, you know, before the modern world, that was actually considered kind of decadent.
2037000	2043000	And the willingness to sort of resist desire, that's not just a Buddhist thing, right?
2043000	2056000	And so, you know, when I look at, say, Justin's experience in academia, I would say that he expected to academia to be one thing, but he found it another.
2056000	2064000	And the way in which he found it another was he expected it to be something that was not corrupted by power, but in fact it was corrupted by power.
2064000	2079000	And so, in a way, the academic systems, even of a, Redbrick University, like the University of Southampton, these academic systems, I'm sorry, I'm just being derogatory for no reason at all.
2079000	2087000	And these academic systems evolved in a world where they were, the relevance was very low.
2087000	2097000	I mean, even, you know, the first, of course, we had this, America had this amazing experience where they elected Woodrow Wilson, who was a professor of political science, president.
2097000	2099000	I'm sure that can never happen again.
2099000	2111000	But, you know, before then, if you look at, like, America in 1900, the idea that professors would tell the government what to do, as you probably know, being a political scientist, was like, it was weird.
2111000	2116000	It would be like hairdressers suddenly took control of Washington, right, you know, and everything was about hair.
2116000	2123000	And suddenly, of course, you know, academics have a much better claim to rule than hairdressers.
2123000	2126000	No offense to any hairdressers out there.
2126000	2140000	But what happened, you know, what led to this sort of kind of way of living that we have now is that you had these, you know, people like the political science professors of 100 years ago.
2141000	2146000	You know, you know, I don't know if you've read any, you know, Charles Francis Adams, Jr.
2146000	2148000	Not much, but at least I know the name.
2148000	2157000	You know, I recommend anyone read his 1900 American Historical Association address on history, if you're interested in history.
2157000	2166000	And he was basically like, look, you know, politics is, you know, conducted on this incredibly crude level.
2167000	2172000	And you have, you know, when you look at what people are thinking about when they vote, they just have no idea what's going on.
2172000	2175000	It's this incredibly long essay that was delivered as an address.
2175000	2181000	He goes through every presidential election between like 1856 and like 1900.
2181000	2184000	And he's just like, in this election, the voters had no clue.
2184000	2187000	In that election, we can see that the voters had no clue.
2187000	2190000	Finally, this election, they had no idea what they were doing.
2190000	2195000	And, you know, he goes through basically both sides of each election were just out of touch with reality.
2195000	2201000	And so, you know, this is kind of the anti-democracy of very early progressivism.
2201000	2206000	And so he's like, okay, you know, here's the ship that is not being steered.
2206000	2209000	It's like a ship without a pilot or a ship with a drunken pilot.
2209000	2212000	Who is capable of steering the ship?
2212000	2213000	And of course, the answer is very clear.
2213000	2215000	Now, Charles Francis Adams, Jr.
2215000	2217000	I mentioned John Adams, you know, earlier.
2217000	2221000	Charles Francis Adams, Jr. is actually the great-grandson of John Adams.
2221000	2225000	So, you know, he's a, you know, this is as blue as American blood comes.
2225000	2230000	And so, in a way, here's this kind of rising academic aristocracy that says,
2230000	2233000	wow, here is a ship with no pilot or a drunken pilot.
2233000	2235000	Someone should take control of it.
2235000	2236000	Someone competent.
2236000	2240000	Someone who just knows what they're doing, who can actually think.
2240000	2244000	This seemed like a great idea at the time.
2244000	2249000	And what people didn't realize is that basically, you know,
2249000	2253000	this is kind of the great lesson of Tolkien that somehow has really been missed,
2253000	2258000	is that basically, when you put on the ring, you become something different.
2258000	2261000	It's like, you know, my son, who's nine, he just read Lord of the Rings.
2261000	2263000	And I'm like, you know, he actually asked me.
2263000	2266000	He's like, why doesn't Gandalf just put on the ring and fucking kick ass?
2266000	2268000	He didn't put it quite that way.
2268000	2272000	And I'm like, well, you know, that question is never really answered in the book.
2272000	2274000	And actually, the book never really tells you.
2274000	2277000	It's like, you know, like Bilbo puts on the ring.
2277000	2281000	Bilbo's magical power of like a, you know, he has no magical powers at all.
2281000	2282000	So it just makes him invisible.
2282000	2286000	But for Gandalf, he could like turn a mountain into a swamp, right?
2286000	2288000	But he would be corrupted by that power.
2288000	2294000	And so in a way, like, you know, in a world where someone like Justin could just be a scholar
2294000	2299000	and just be like, oh, you know, I'm interested in some issue of political science.
2299000	2302000	You know, and it didn't matter.
2302000	2304000	That would be very easy.
2304000	2309000	But in a world where it does matter, what you're going to find is that it matters.
2309000	2314000	And that's going to attract people like your dean or whatever who are going to be like,
2314000	2316000	this guy is not a team player.
2316000	2317000	This guy is not with the program.
2317000	2322000	But do you think that because so much intellectual activity or supposedly intellectual activity today
2322000	2329000	is colonized by this kind of power hungry institutionalized kind of corruption.
2329000	2335000	Is it not in some sense a great moment for true intellectuals who want to just turn to their blog
2335000	2339000	or write books for truly radically disinterested truth seeking purposes?
2339000	2343000	Is now is not now perhaps one of the greatest times to be doing that precisely
2343000	2347000	because so much of what passes for intellectual activity has nothing to do with intellectual activity.
2347000	2350000	Well, you know, it's a great moment, but it's not an easy moment.
2350000	2355000	You know, you know, let me tell you about the time I was detained in the New Zealand airport.
2355000	2363000	Or let me not, but the, you know, of course, as I said, you know, with Fred earlier, you know,
2363000	2366000	if it's easy, you're not, you're wasting time, right?
2366000	2373000	But, you know, it's certainly not easy, but, you know, it's an interesting, you know, promising time.
2373000	2380000	You know, it's like, you know, in answer this question, I had a little, I really don't know Justin at all.
2380000	2386000	I don't trust him, but I had an email exchange with him where I was like, you know,
2386000	2390000	clearly what he's doing down here is pretty interesting and pretty cool.
2390000	2394000	And, you know, when I look at all of you in the audience, I say that you're pretty cool people.
2394000	2401000	I'm also older than about all of you, you know, which is interesting and always a good sign, actually.
2401000	2406000	And so, you know, I was like, Justin, I think this is still available,
2406000	2412000	but, you know, anyone who wants to, is interested in doing the same thing can go on YouTube.
2412000	2416000	And there's an old PBS documentary about David Geffen.
2416000	2420000	So people in the room probably know who David Geffen was, right?
2420000	2428000	So basically, David Geffen, you know, I think he has a boat the size of the USS Nimitz or something.
2428000	2431000	You know, David Geffen has done very well for himself,
2431000	2436000	and, you know, he hasn't done well by, you know, being a parent.
2436000	2438000	Well, maybe a little bit of a parasite.
2438000	2442000	But what David Geffen did in this PBS documentary is very informative,
2442000	2445000	is he basically figured out how to sell the hippies.
2445000	2450000	And his procedure in selling the hippies was, I'm going to become a hippie.
2450000	2456000	I'm going to move into a hippie house, hang out with other hippies, listen to their hippie music.
2456000	2461000	And when I listen to their hippie music, I'll be like, hmm, these people are good.
2461000	2463000	These people, not so much.
2463000	2465000	You know, hippie music had varied a lot, right?
2465000	2470000	And then he's like, I'm going to take the good people and I'm going to stamp them on wax.
2470000	2474000	And I'm going to sell them to the American people who, it's 1967 or whatever,
2474000	2479000	believe that, like, Satan has come back to the earth in Southern California.
2479000	2484000	And, you know, of course, in the shape of Manson, Satan does come back,
2484000	2486000	which is kind of part of the problem.
2486000	2492000	But I'm going to sell this to, like, all of America, and I'm going to get incredibly rich.
2492000	2499000	And so, you know, and of course, you know, even the stuff he recorded is,
2499000	2502000	some of it has lasted as art, some of it has not lasted.
2502000	2504000	But, you know, he was seriously trying.
2504000	2510000	Like, he was actually trying to, you know, hear something amazing that's happening.
2510000	2512000	Maybe he was a bit of a hippie himself, I don't know.
2512000	2514000	But he certainly did drugs with them.
2514000	2521000	But, I think, but, you know, to sort of bring that into the modern world,
2521000	2527000	there was a piece I read in The New York Times about six months ago or so,
2527000	2533000	maybe six months a year or something, and it was about the YouTube rabbit hole of radicalization.
2533000	2536000	You've probably heard about the YouTube rabbit hole of radicalization.
2536000	2538000	They're working hard on that one, folks.
2538000	2543000	And, you know, I wouldn't be surprised, just because I mentioned this,
2543000	2546000	you know, like, I've doubled your chances of getting demonetized.
2546000	2549000	But it was a good story.
2549000	2552000	It was really well reported, a really solid story.
2552000	2559000	And the, but there was this sort of interesting moment where they interviewed this YouTube engineer
2559000	2566000	who, or, like, had a comment from this engineer who'd done this kind of internal engagement study on YouTube.
2566000	2571000	And he was like, well, you know, we don't usually think of this as a vertical.
2571000	2575000	But if you did think of it as a vertical, I'm sure, you know, for his query purposes,
2575000	2579000	he's defining this just incredibly, ultimately broadly, right?
2579000	2582000	But he's like, if you did think of it as a vertical,
2582000	2586000	then basically, if you looked at our top four verticals,
2586000	2595000	it would be like gaming and, you know, music and sports and the alt-right.
2596000	2598000	And that's what the article said.
2598000	2601000	Now, you know, I mean, obviously, I'm reading this in New York Times.
2601000	2605000	So, you know, we have to discount this a little bit.
2605000	2610000	But the thing is, and this is sort of both the problem and the paradox in a way,
2610000	2615000	is that there's this sort of enormous demand for heterodox content out there.
2615000	2619000	And what's missing is basically David Geffen to come and say,
2619000	2624000	this is the good heterodox content, this other stuff is just crap.
2624000	2627000	So you really do get my project then.
2627000	2628000	I appreciate that.
2628000	2630000	Maybe I invented it first.
2630000	2632000	But yeah, no, I think that is your...
2632000	2636000	Well, the thing is, you know, one of the things is, like,
2636000	2641000	when you're looking at anything that's like true or makes sense,
2641000	2645000	what you'll see is that a lot of people invent it at the same time.
2645000	2648000	And, you know, it's only people like you who execute, you know,
2648000	2652000	rather than me who sits in my room and just scribbles,
2652000	2654000	who actually gets things done.
2654000	2658000	I mean, you know, like, and so it's great that you create your own content,
2658000	2660000	but you may have more of a role as a David Geffen.
2660000	2661000	Interesting.
2661000	2662000	Interesting.
2662000	2663000	Gone.
2663000	2668000	But yeah, that's in a sense the level of opportunity.
2668000	2671000	And what's missing is, like, when you think about...
2671000	2674000	I think when most people think about, you know,
2674000	2678000	there's sort of many meanings of this, you know, strange term alt-right, right?
2678000	2681000	What it meant in 2015 is not what it means now.
2681000	2684000	As you're well aware, there are plenty of people in the world
2684000	2686000	with the power to change the meaning of a word,
2686000	2689000	not individuals but systems.
2689000	2693000	And so in a way that word has changed, you know, you might say now,
2693000	2696000	if you're casting the broadest possible net, you know,
2696000	2699000	dissident right, you know, deep right, you know,
2699000	2702000	I tried to make this catch on, but totally failed.
2702000	2705000	You know, people only, you know, if you're coining things,
2705000	2707000	like, almost everything will fail.
2707000	2709000	And you just got to bear that in mind.
2709000	2715000	And so in a way, you know, when you look at the breadth of that set,
2715000	2723000	what's really missing there is a really just savage quality filter,
2723000	2725000	like a really ruthless quality filter.
2725000	2727000	And that's not even going to be a filter.
2727000	2729000	And the one thing I do think...
2729000	2732000	Well, Justin gets many things, but one thing I do think Justin gets
2732000	2735000	is that that filter, when most people think about that filter,
2735000	2738000	they're like, they're still thinking these very conventional terms,
2738000	2741000	so they're just like, oh, you know, well, the moderate side of this is okay,
2741000	2744000	but then there are these people who go too far.
2744000	2750000	And I wouldn't say, like, thinking about it in those terms is very unproductive,
2750000	2753000	but there are certainly many, it's very, very easy.
2753000	2756000	There are many ways to just simply be wrong,
2756000	2759000	and you're just never going to win by being wrong.
2759000	2764000	I'm curious, what kind of traffic was unqualified reservations getting at its peak?
2764000	2765000	I never looked.
2765000	2766000	You never looked?
2766000	2767000	No.
2767000	2768000	Really?
2768000	2769000	No.
2769000	2770000	I never looked.
2770000	2771000	Okay.
2771000	2772000	Interesting.
2772000	2776000	If you were writing unqualified reservations today from scratch,
2776000	2779000	let's say you were at the same age that you were writing unqualified reservations,
2779000	2782000	but it's today, would you do anything differently?
2782000	2784000	Yeah, I'd probably do everything differently.
2784000	2788000	I mean, for one thing, well, for one thing, the age of the blog is gone.
2788000	2791000	So, you know, a couple of things have changed about the internet.
2792000	2794000	The age of the blog is gone.
2794000	2795000	It's dead.
2795000	2796000	It's over.
2796000	2797000	It's done.
2797000	2798000	You can't bring it back.
2798000	2799000	It's very sad.
2799000	2802000	The age in which the internet was sort of something special
2802000	2805000	that not everyone was on is completely dead.
2805000	2808000	You know, basically, in Usenet in, you know, 1991,
2808000	2813000	even you sort of relied on the just the abstruseness of this medium
2813000	2817000	to provide, you know, this kind of passive gatekeeping function,
2817000	2819000	which is the same kind of function.
2819000	2821000	Anyone here been to Burning Man?
2821000	2823000	Probably maybe one or two people.
2823000	2826000	It's the same kind of gatekeeping function that being out in the desert
2826000	2829000	provides to Burning Man, and it just provides this awesome experience
2829000	2831000	of being with people who are your people.
2831000	2833000	And that's why people go to Burning Man.
2833000	2835000	It's not because they like the fucking desert.
2835000	2838000	And, you know, if you could actually have Burning Man,
2838000	2841000	well, I mean, the first Burning Man's were on the beach, right?
2841000	2844000	You know, in like Santa Cruz or something.
2844000	2847000	And then it started getting too popular,
2847000	2851000	so that's what happened to, you know, to Usenet.
2851000	2855000	So basically, when people were writing blogs in like,
2855000	2858000	I started writing, I started my blog in 2007.
2858000	2861000	Even, and that was very late, and I always used this very old,
2861000	2864000	old-fashioned, ugly-looking blogger template,
2864000	2866000	which was even more embarrassing.
2866000	2868000	Of course, there were no ads on blogs now.
2868000	2871000	I'm always embarrassed when I open someone's WordPress,
2871000	2874000	and I see like the ads that they're earning like six bucks a month off of.
2874000	2876000	You know, I'm just like embarrassed for you
2876000	2879000	that you have to like present your content this way, you know,
2879000	2881000	and you don't even have to.
2881000	2885000	And so, you know, furthermore, so the idea of there sort of being
2885000	2890000	these decentralized sort of pieces of the Internet,
2890000	2892000	that's not the real Internet anymore.
2892000	2894000	That's not what the Internet is.
2894000	2895000	That should be reality.
2895000	2897000	That should be what the next network is.
2897000	2899000	But that's certainly not what the Internet is.
2899000	2903000	And so that's dead.
2903000	2907000	Another thing that's dead is when you look at these big, you know,
2907000	2909000	these hosting services like Blogger,
2909000	2911000	which was once an independent company,
2911000	2913000	but then was acquired by Google, of course.
2913000	2917000	You basically, when you first started using these centralized Internet services,
2917000	2919000	the way you thought about it was basically,
2919000	2924000	this was just kind of a more convenient way of implementing the decentralized Internet.
2924000	2926000	The ethos was still decentralized.
2926000	2929000	And so the idea that you would publish a blog on Blogger,
2929000	2932000	and then you would get like an email from like some Google staffer
2932000	2934000	being like, oh, you can't write this essay,
2934000	2936000	or like your Gmail account would disappear
2936000	2939000	because you said the wrong thing in your blog,
2939000	2941000	that was unthinkable.
2941000	2945000	Like that, you could not imagine that happening in 2008.
2945000	2950000	And maybe in a sense, maybe you had an intuitive sense that that era was ending,
2950000	2953000	but it's certainly long since it disappeared.
2953000	2955000	Okay. Yeah, that's interesting.
2955000	2958000	One of the things people often ask me is,
2958000	2961000	Justin, you know, why are you so interested in people like Curtis Jarvan or Nick Land?
2961000	2964000	Why are you interested in these kind of extreme right-wingers?
2964000	2968000	And they often take this as evidence that I am therefore an extreme right-winger,
2968000	2969000	which I'm not.
2969000	2971000	Justin, are you going to hire for us tonight?
2971000	2974000	No, I wouldn't count on that.
2974000	2979000	And what I tell people often is that people on the left
2979000	2983000	should be really interested in smart people on the right,
2983000	2985000	even the extreme right, who are smart
2985000	2990000	and who are able to correctly and adequately
2990000	2996000	kind of push away the dumbest, most violent and nasty aspects of the right.
2996000	2998000	So someone like you, for instance,
2998000	3002000	you're very explicit about having very little interest in white nationalism, for instance.
3002000	3005000	Yeah, I keep meaning to actually go on Nazi podcasts and argue with them.
3005000	3010000	I may actually do this, you know, and like, because these people are just,
3010000	3013000	I don't want to be arrogant, but I think they're just defenseless against me.
3013000	3017000	And it's not like, you know, the way, the right way,
3017000	3021000	whether you're arguing with a Nazi or a progressive or anything in between,
3021000	3024000	you know, no, they're very different.
3024000	3027000	You know, whether you're arguing with any of those,
3027000	3029000	you know, it should never be an argument.
3029000	3033000	You're not arguing, do not ever have political arguments as very bad,
3033000	3035000	an unproductive thing to do.
3035000	3037000	It should not be an argument, it should not be a fight.
3037000	3040000	What you're doing, whenever you talk to someone who doesn't share your beliefs,
3040000	3042000	is in fact an intervention.
3042000	3045000	And so you're basically thinking of this person as an addict,
3046000	3048000	and he's addicted to the wrong drug.
3048000	3051000	He needs to give that drug up and start taking your drug.
3051000	3054000	I told you he was a pill dispenser.
3054000	3057000	But, you know, that's okay because the first step, your honor,
3057000	3060000	I mean, sure, I'll say, I have something that's actually good for you
3060000	3062000	that will make you feel amazing, but, you know,
3062000	3065000	your first step is to get off this junk you're taking, right?
3065000	3069000	And so, you know, basically, you know, at one point,
3069000	3072000	in my, you know, vein attempt to coin terms,
3072000	3074000	I came up with the term of brown scare,
3074000	3077000	which is like the red scare but our fear of Nazis.
3077000	3080000	You know, there's this like Nazi hunters billboard just down the street from us.
3080000	3083000	Imagine if it was like the 50s and it was like commie hunters.
3083000	3086000	They actually made this great movie called I Married a Communist.
3086000	3088000	It's absolutely worth seeing.
3088000	3091000	Hollywood, like, had to be, like, had its arm twisted
3091000	3094000	in order to make this anti-communist movie.
3094000	3098000	But, you know, brown scare didn't really take off
3098000	3100000	because simply people are ignorant today
3100000	3102000	and didn't know the brown is the color of Nazis,
3102000	3106000	but the, which is, I mean, that's just terrible.
3106000	3108000	Like, you have, like, you're obsessed with Nazis
3108000	3111000	and you don't know anything about Nazis, you know?
3111000	3115000	You know, the Nazi party headquarters was the brown house, right?
3115000	3119000	And so, you know, basically what happened, you know,
3119000	3122000	I came up with this, you know, I've admitted it, I guess,
3122000	3125000	so I came up with this stupid fucking meme, the red pill, right?
3125000	3128000	Or I stole it from the Wachowskis, rather.
3128000	3130000	And I really just robbed them.
3130000	3137000	And imagine how much they must hate hearing that shit, right?
3137000	3139000	You know?
3139000	3142000	Dear Wachowsky siblings, if you're watching right now,
3142000	3144000	I'm sorry it was not right.
3144000	3150000	And so, basically, you know, I had this idea
3150000	3152000	and I filled this, you know, pill with all these, like,
3152000	3154000	exotic ingredients in my pill.
3154000	3158000	It cost, like, you know, $500 or it was at least 5,000 words.
3158000	3162000	You know, it was a very high quality product and still is.
3162000	3165000	And then, of course, you know, what happens to high quality products
3165000	3168000	when you put them on Amazon, they get pirated.
3168000	3173000	And so, basically, you know, I mean, it's fairly easy to determine
3173000	3176000	that I was the first that was using this stupid meme,
3176000	3180000	but, you know, there's a kind of puzzle that you don't really,
3180000	3183000	can't really understand otherwise about this red pill thing,
3183000	3188000	but it kind of seems to simultaneously appear among pickup artists
3188000	3190000	and Nazis.
3190000	3193000	And then, you know, so the question you have to ask yourself is,
3193000	3195000	who is copying who?
3195000	3198000	Did the pickup artist be like, oh, I like this Nazi thing,
3198000	3200000	I'm going to steal it, or was it the other way around?
3200000	3202000	And, you know, the reality is they both stole it from me,
3202000	3204000	but I stole it from Wachowskys.
3204000	3209000	And so, you know, basically, if you go out on the street
3209000	3213000	and you know, just go, like, you know, down to the local corner
3213000	3216000	and get a red pill, what you're going to be getting
3216000	3219000	is either a brown pill or a pink pill.
3219000	3222000	That is certainly not a product I can endorse.
3222000	3227000	But, you know, the story of Albert Hoffman, right?
3227000	3229000	Yes, that's the story I do.
3229000	3233000	So, because still, to this day, most of my audience is,
3233000	3236000	more than half of my audience listening to this now and in the future,
3236000	3240000	it will be left-wingers, no matter how many people call me a reactionary
3240000	3242000	or try to smear me in that way.
3242000	3244000	Nonetheless, most of the people who listen to this stuff are themselves
3244000	3248000	just kind of on the more anti-woke wing of the left wing.
3248000	3250000	So, I'm curious, you probably don't have too many opportunities
3250000	3252000	to address this particular cohort.
3252000	3255000	I'm kind of curious, you know, you wrote on...
3255000	3259000	People on the edge of being like, you know, chop-o-heads and so forth.
3259000	3260000	Yeah.
3260000	3263000	You know, well, Justin, you know, what would be actually kind of cool is if,
3264000	3269000	you know, weren't you or aren't you or don't you have a past as a very, you know,
3269000	3271000	unironic leftist?
3271000	3275000	Can you tell us about the experience of being a junkie?
3275000	3279000	Yeah, I mean, in many ways, I'm still happy to identify as a leftist in some ways.
3279000	3283000	As I get older, I get a little bit more socially conservative in certain dimensions.
3283000	3285000	That's partially a life-cycle effect.
3285000	3288000	It's a pretty robust phenomenon, actually.
3288000	3291000	But in many ways, my politics haven't really changed.
3291000	3295000	My kind of cultural strategy for being a free person has changed.
3295000	3297000	I've had to update that a lot.
3297000	3299000	It was really, actually, you might be interested to know this, Curtis,
3299000	3303000	that it was a blog post I wrote, the beginning of the end for me,
3303000	3306000	and kind of the organized, institutionalized kind of respectable left,
3306000	3310000	was really a blog post that I wrote around 2017.
3310000	3313000	I came to your blog very late, well after its heyday.
3313000	3315000	I just came across people like you and Nick Land.
3315000	3316000	I was an academic.
3316000	3319000	I was holed up just reading only approved academic literatures
3319000	3322000	and just working in a cave on my academic research.
3322000	3324000	I came across your blog.
3324000	3326000	I came across Nick Land's blog.
3326000	3329000	My initial kind of intuition was just like,
3329000	3332000	oh, I thought all these right-wingers were supposed to be stupid,
3332000	3335000	but these are clearly smart people with serious ideas.
3335000	3342000	I was honestly kind of naively shocked to discover some real intellectual horsepower
3342000	3344000	on blogs such as yours and Nick Land's.
3344000	3347000	I wrote a simple blog post in 2017 as an academic,
3347000	3350000	very naive, just kind of well-behaved academic,
3350000	3354000	saying, hey, there are some people on the radical right
3354000	3356000	who are actually really, really smart,
3356000	3358000	and I actually read a lot of it, guys,
3358000	3361000	and they don't seem that bad.
3361000	3363000	They don't seem half as evil as people say.
3363000	3366000	They're not endorsing any type of obvious, harmful racism
3366000	3369000	that I can see you and Nick Land are both at pains,
3369000	3371000	actually, to reject white nationalism.
3371000	3373000	I was like, this is actually interesting.
3373000	3375000	Smart people on the extreme right.
3375000	3379000	It's actually a valuable thing to have in a genuine free ecosystem
3379000	3381000	of intellectual culture.
3381000	3383000	So I tried to write this blog post to my cop.
3383000	3385000	I think you got a lot of positive feedback on that.
3385000	3388000	Well, this was the beginning of the end for me.
3388000	3392000	I got a lot of heat for that and pretty much make a long story short.
3392000	3395000	That was when I pretty much, it was clear that wasn't allowed
3395000	3398000	to just simply say, hey, this stuff is worth paying attention to.
3398000	3401000	I think you'll find generally that if people talk about a Voldemort,
3401000	3403000	they're working for Voldemort.
3403000	3406000	Well, yeah, so in any event, since you asked,
3406000	3408000	that's when I was pretty much was like,
3408000	3410000	my politics didn't fundamentally change.
3410000	3413000	I've always been interested in a certain kind of radical left vision,
3413000	3416000	which I see as associated with transgression and freedom
3416000	3419000	and a kind of cultural radicalism of...
3419000	3420000	That's the bait.
3420000	3422000	Yeah, well, in any event.
3422000	3426000	In any event, it was really then that that was the beginning of the end for me.
3426000	3431000	And so since then, I've been trying to occupy this space of not...
3431000	3433000	Because in some ways, I'm being baited by the culture
3433000	3436000	and I'm being baited by other left-wingers to become a right-winger.
3436000	3439000	The more people call me, oh, Justin, you're a reactionary, you're a racist,
3439000	3441000	because you want to talk with people like Curtis Jarvan,
3441000	3446000	in some sense, I can feel psychological attraction to owning that, right?
3446000	3448000	I'm not a racist. I've never have been.
3448000	3451000	I don't have many even right-wing attitudes or opinions,
3451000	3454000	but the sociology of it is pushing me into it.
3454000	3458000	And so I noticed that and I think it would be easy
3458000	3460000	and self-serving to just join the right-wing groups.
3460000	3463000	Like they wouldn't make fun of me or call me these nasty names.
3463000	3465000	I could just hang out with them.
3465000	3470000	But then I realized, no, someone needs to hold this ground of an actual radical left
3470000	3472000	that isn't on board with any of this woke bullshit
3472000	3477000	and is actually just interested in truly radically free intellectual life,
3477000	3479000	whether it be on the right wing or the left wing or whatever.
3479000	3482000	And so you asked me to kind of talk about that a little bit.
3482000	3484000	So that's all that's relevant for here.
3484000	3486000	I'm curious from your perspective,
3486000	3489000	because you don't get to address many anti-woke leftists, presumably,
3489000	3491000	just because of how you're perceived,
3491000	3493000	and I think in many ways you're perceived quite unfairly,
3493000	3498000	I'm just curious if you maybe have a particular unique message to the anti-woke left.
3498000	3501000	Well, you know, I do have a lot of these conversations,
3501000	3504000	but they're typically in private for obvious reasons.
3504000	3506000	Do you have a lot of friends who are leftists?
3506000	3508000	One or two.
3508000	3515000	But, you know, I don't know, friends is a strong word, contacts perhaps.
3515000	3524000	But, yeah, you know, the thing is when people use these words,
3524000	3529000	you know, right and left, these are very, very complicated, deep words,
3529000	3531000	and, you know, people throw them around.
3531000	3536000	You ever see that, you know, fake viral video of the chimp with AK-47?
3536000	3540000	You know, I mean, these are words that, you know, are full of 200 years of history,
3540000	3544000	and so to use them in a naive way, I think, is somewhat dangerous.
3545000	3552000	You know, certainly, you know, one of the things that I was noticing back, you know,
3552000	3560000	almost 15 years ago now that I think is very commonplace is that when people,
3560000	3565000	I think when you talk about, say, you know, your anti-woke leftists, for example,
3565000	3570000	they'll have this wonderful word, the professional managerial class, you know,
3570000	3575000	which is, you know, I mean, it's a lot of syllables, you just say, the ruling class,
3575000	3579000	you know, or the governing class is a little less pejorative.
3579000	3581000	I was certainly brought up in that class.
3581000	3583000	My father was an American diplomat.
3583000	3586000	I went to Johns Hopkins in Brown in Berkeley.
3586000	3593000	And so, you know, I definitely wouldn't say that, you know, I have any,
3593000	3596000	I thought of kind of committing treason to this class.
3596000	3599000	Actually, I love these people, they're my people.
3599000	3603000	Culturally, you know, I can hang out with middle Americans,
3603000	3609000	but I'm much more likely to get along with elite blue state ruling class Americans.
3609000	3617000	But, you know, one of the things about this ruling class is that I think it's become
3617000	3620000	very much kind of corrupted by power.
3620000	3623000	I think it's kind of merits as human beings, it's intelligence,
3623000	3626000	it's ability to take standardized tests, it's cleverness.
3626000	3632000	These things have not dropped at all, but it's effectiveness and it's wisdom,
3632000	3637000	I think, are much lower than they were in the age of Woodrow fucking Wilson.
3637000	3642000	And, you know, that's kind of the tragedy that I think needs to be addressed.
3642000	3647000	And so, in a way, when I look at, you know, the anti-woke kind of leftists in a sense,
3647000	3653000	even to be, even to have a political agenda implies that you're part of the ruling class.
3653000	3655000	You're like, this should be done, that should be done.
3655000	3657000	It's like thinking like a king, right?
3657000	3660000	You know, one of the things I really try to do is not to think that this way
3660000	3664000	and not to have, not to think in terms of agenda politics
3664000	3668000	because you're basically implying that you're a ruler in some sense.
3668000	3670000	Well, you know, you're either in the loop or you're not in the loop.
3670000	3672000	If you're in the loop, you know it.
3672000	3674000	If you're not in the loop, you're basically a sports fan.
3674000	3677000	And so you're kind of having this kind of embarrassing pornographic experience,
3677000	3679000	you know, with respect to power.
3679000	3684000	And I really try to avoid that, especially in public.
3684000	3692000	And so, in a way, it's like my, you know, message to these people is, you know,
3692000	3695000	I think that they've, you know, it's like if you look at your average,
3695000	3698000	you know, get even past the anti-woke leftist.
3698000	3701000	If you look at your average, I don't like to use pejoridose,
3701000	3703000	but I might say a Bernie Bro.
3703000	3708000	You know, so if you're a Bernie Bro, basically, you've noticed that there's something a little weird
3708000	3710000	about the Democratic Party.
3710000	3714000	And that's maybe it's not, you know, like Hillary Clinton is not like this kind of pure angel of light
3714000	3717000	that you used to maybe think she was.
3717000	3722000	And so, in a way, you know, what you've done is kind of taken this kind of first, you know,
3722000	3725000	skeptical step in a sense.
3725000	3728000	But, you know, one step is not really a journey.
3728000	3731000	And so, you know, when you basically look at these, you know,
3731000	3736000	when you look at the DNC shitting on Bernie or you look at the New York Times shitting on Bernie,
3736000	3738000	and you're like, wow, this is very unfair.
3738000	3744000	And then you go and read, you know, the next thing down in which you trust this institution absolutely.
3744000	3749000	And it's like once that absolute trust gets questioned,
3749000	3755000	what you'll find is that there's never really a point at which you stop stripping away layers.
3755000	3758000	And, you know, you strip away layers and layers and layers and layers and layers.
3758000	3763000	And sooner or before you know it, you're like debunking the fucking American Revolution, right?
3764000	3766000	Which literally happened to me.
3766000	3769000	I mean, I could debunk the American Revolution for you, you know.
3769000	3771000	Go for it, man.
3771000	3772000	Do we need that?
3772000	3774000	If you'd like to, whatever you'd like.
3774000	3775000	I think people would be interested.
3775000	3776000	Do you want me?
3776000	3779000	Okay, so I'll try to be brief.
3779000	3781000	Obviously, very complicated series of events.
3781000	3789000	The American Revolution is basically the Vietnam War in the 18th century with Britain in the position of the U.S.
3789000	3797000	It's actually a civil conflict in between two factions, kind of, not just kind of left and right,
3797000	3800000	but, you know, Wig and Tory, but these are also religious factions.
3800000	3803000	So it's dissenter or puritan against Anglican.
3803000	3808000	You know, all these things are not, they're not consistently aligned, but they're sort of generally aligned.
3808000	3814000	And so, you know, the way from an 18th century English perspective to think of America,
3814000	3818000	imagine you're like a puritan in England.
3818000	3822000	Suppose, it's not quite the same thing, but suppose you're a libertarian today.
3822000	3826000	And then you hear about the libertarian paradise that's been built in Honduras.
3826000	3829000	You would be very supportive of that paradise.
3829000	3837000	And then, you know, if your, you know, government, you know, sent the Marines to go and wipe out the libertarian paradise in Honduras,
3837000	3839000	you would have a bad reaction to that.
3839000	3848000	And so, there's this sort of strange situation arises where, you know, there's this conflict between two segments of English society,
3848000	3855000	and then that conflict is a cold war at home, but abroad it's actually a hot war.
3855000	3865000	And that hot war, essentially, the Americans win the war not because they're militarily superior,
3865000	3873000	but because Britain has very little will to fight at any point and loses that will, basically, completely.
3873000	3877000	So question, are the founding fathers based or cringe?
3877000	3883000	Well, you know, there's a lot of, there's a lot, you're including a lot of different individuals there.
3883000	3886000	Sort them out then, or the ones you have.
3886000	3891000	So, you know, there's definitely a cringe aspect to Jefferson, but I mean,
3891000	3895000	because, you know, Jefferson, you know, becomes this huge fan of the French Revolution.
3895000	3897000	He's like this massive Francophile.
3897000	3902000	You know, he writes these things about the French Revolution where he's like, you know, the tree of liberty must be watered with blood, you know.
3902000	3905000	Like, have you ever listened to the lyrics of the Marseillais?
3905000	3907000	I'm not sure I recall.
3907000	3913000	Like, the French national anthem is all about like, we must drown the country in the blood of the foreigners, or what the fuck, right?
3913000	3915000	They sing this.
3915000	3925000	And so, you know, there are aspects of the American Revolution which are, especially the early American Revolution, which are very, very Jacobin-like.
3925000	3932000	So if you look at a figure like Samuel Adams, who kind of disappears from history because he's just a fuck.
3932000	3937000	You know, like, he's like, you know, who would Samuel Adams be?
3937000	3942000	You know, Bill Ayers is not too far away from Samuel Adams, right?
3942000	3947000	These are really just this complete rabble, completely unprincipled rabble-raser.
3947000	3950000	And they were all torn on the French Revolution. This was a major point of attention.
3950000	3955000	Well, later. I mean, of course, this is well before the French Revolution, right, because it's 1775, right?
3955000	3965000	But, you know, the French Revolution is this kind of dark imitation of the American Revolution done by these Anglophiles, basically.
3965000	3975000	And, you know, but of course we forget is that our Glorious Constitution, you know, is established in 1789, is established in a reactionary coup.
3975000	3983000	Not only is the Constitution a reactionary coup basically orchestrated by George Washington and his friends, a very monarchical individual.
3983000	3993000	One of the things you'll notice is basically the first, you know, you probably can name, you know, the first American Constitution, the Articles of Confederation.
3993000	3999000	The period of basically the Congress of the Confederation totally airbrushed out of history.
3999000	4004000	Do you know who America's first president was? It was John Hansen, the president of the Congress.
4004000	4014000	And the results of that system were so disastrous, and the results of that system were identified by people like John Adams, literally with democracy.
4014000	4023000	And, you know, basically, like there was just a period of like, they were just like, this is a shit show, we have to establish basically responsible aristocratic government.
4023000	4029000	We have to replace democracy with oligarchy. And so we're going to run this constitutional convention thing.
4029000	4030000	But you like that part?
4030000	4038000	Well, I mean, that part was, you know, that part was an improvement in that situation.
4038000	4045000	You know, this certainly, the new republic was very much an aristocratic republic, and, you know, it managed to subsist.
4045000	4054000	I mean, people go and watch, you know, Hamilton. I mean, if God, if they knew the things Hamilton said about democracy, I mean, you know, I'm like, Alex, you got to calm down.
4054000	4068000	So, you know, I mean, it's a complicated era. You can't reduce, you know, the like, you know, 25 years between 70, 75 and 1800 to like, these people were based or cringe.
4068000	4069000	Sure, of course.
4069000	4074000	But yeah, if you want to read about this, let's get off the subject, which is very, very technical.
4074000	4082000	You know, the one thing that I discovered that's absolutely wonderful is, let me tell you, in a form of a parable, let's say you grew up in Slobovia.
4083000	4089000	Imaginary country. And all you know, all you go to school, you hear about the glories of the Slobovian Revolution.
4089000	4093000	You know, of course, that there was a Slobovia before the revolution.
4093000	4100000	You know, like, there was a period of, you know, Slobovia was under the heel of an evil monarchy, you know, that, right?
4100000	4111000	And the, you know, the hero of the Slobovian Revolution, George Washington Tonovitch, you know, changed all of that, statues to him, or everywhere, yada, yada, yada, yada.
4111000	4118000	So, you know, you're, you grew up believing this, you know, and being like a little cult of personnel.
4118000	4122000	It's George Slobovitch Day, whatever, right? Washingtonovitch.
4122000	4133000	And then one day, you know, some people at this company, Slugal, you know, do something weird for, like, just weird pothead reasons,
4133000	4137000	which is they're like, we're going to put all books ever written in Slobovian online.
4137000	4140000	Of course, this includes books from before the revolution.
4140000	4142000	Like, it includes all kinds of weird books, right?
4142000	4146000	And stuff that's just, like, totally not cool.
4146000	4153000	And so one day, you're on Slugal and you're browsing, you know, these books, and you're like, for some reason, you type in the phrase,
4153000	4156000	True History of the Slobovian Revolution.
4156000	4166000	And the first result, I believe this still works, the first result of this is a book whose title is True History of the Slobovian Revolution.
4166000	4171000	And this book, turns out, was written over 100 years ago.
4171000	4176000	And you're like, oh, that's interesting, I wonder what these old weirdos 100 years ago thought about this Slobovian Revolution.
4176000	4181000	And you start reading it and you're like, oh, oh, well, that makes so much sense.
4181000	4183000	Oh, well, I never understood that at all.
4183000	4185000	You know, it's like, so here's an example.
4185000	4188000	You know, ever been, anyone here been to Philly?
4188000	4189000	Probably some people.
4189000	4192000	Ever been to Valley Forge?
4192000	4196000	How close is Valley Forge to Philadelphia?
4196000	4198000	Pretty, it's like 20 miles.
4198000	4200000	You could walk there in a day, right?
4200000	4211000	So how is it that in the winter of, I think, 77 or 78, I think 77, maybe no, 78, whatever, I'm not one for details.
4211000	4215000	Lord Howe is partying like a monster in Philadelphia.
4215000	4216000	He's occupied Philadelphia.
4216000	4224000	He's gone off and left Burgoyne, who is marching down, remember the Saratoga where the tide turns, yada, yada, you remember like the third grade history.
4224000	4237000	Burgoyne has this plan, Burgoyne, who's an actual Tory, also a playwright, by the way, has this plan to basically cut the Republican half by invading from Canada down the Hudson.
4237000	4242000	And basically Howe, who's the overall commander, ghosts him.
4242000	4254000	Literally, like basically just ignores the plan, like he's like, I didn't even get that letter, goes and occupies Philadelphia, which is a very civilized town, and just like parties like an animal all winter.
4254000	4260000	Meanwhile, in Valley Forge, 20 miles away, George Washington is starving with his troops.
4260000	4264000	Now, it was the 18th century, they didn't usually fight in the winter, but come on.
4264000	4267000	Can't you go out there and be like, hey, why don't you guys surrender?
4267000	4268000	Do you want a hamburger?
4269000	4273000	And like militarily, it simply doesn't make sense.
4273000	4285000	And essentially what Sidney Fisher, the author of this book, The True History of the American Revolution, points out is that you just can't understand the history of the American Revolution.
4285000	4291000	Just like you can't understand the history of Vietnam, if you're only understanding it militarily.
4291000	4299000	You have to have an accurate and what I would call Machiavellian, which just means realistic understanding of what was actually going on.
4299000	4301000	And once you do, you're like, this makes so much sense.
4301000	4309000	So here you're reading this book, it's not even a primary source, and you're just like, this is much more convincing than anything I've ever learned.
4309000	4317000	So that was like, and the great thing about debunking the American Revolution is that, you know, like, to quote Henry Ford, all of history is bunk.
4318000	4322000	You can debunk basically any conflict in history.
4322000	4323000	It will be written by the winners.
4323000	4325000	It's always more complicated than that.
4325000	4331000	But, you know, you want to go in and, you know, rewrite the history of World War II of the Civil War.
4331000	4338000	You can get away with World War I kind of, you know, you'll get a lot of, that's a very complicated and interesting problem.
4338000	4346000	But the Revolutionary War, what's amazing about debunking the American Revolution is that now in 2020, nobody actually gives a shit about it.
4346000	4349000	You can basically go and be in a bar and be like, man, the British were right.
4349000	4352000	We should still be under King George III, and we'll be like, man, that's cool.
4352000	4355000	It's so cool that you think that.
4355000	4360000	Well, this is another one of those strange convergences with the radical left-wing critique, right?
4360000	4363000	Because the left also debunks the American Revolution.
4363000	4369000	Oh, yeah, we're supposed to admire those people, but really they were property-owning slave owners.
4369000	4370000	That's all bunk.
4370000	4372000	It's in a weird way you're converging with them.
4372000	4381000	Well, you know, what I would say about, you know, if you read like, you know, you can read, you know, Chomsky is a great one for, you know, Chomsky is also a pill dispenser.
4381000	4389000	You know, and you'll read, it's sort of interesting when you read kind of leftist debunkings.
4389000	4396000	And, you know, when I use the word leftist, I kind of mean, you know, you've kind of become a ringwraith to some extent.
4396000	4406000	So, you know, you're kind of corrupted by when it's someone like Chomsky, say, would read the American Revolution or any kind of, you know, don't even start me on like the 1619 project.
4406000	4414000	Basically, they're writing their own history that's generally based on actual facts, although, you know, for the 1619 project, I think we've gone a little beyond that.
4414000	4420000	But generally based on actual facts, but you're writing this history to be useful.
4420000	4425000	And so you're looking for something, here is a piece of history that is useful to me, right?
4425000	4434000	And in what way could the story of, you know, the Crimean War be useful to the audiences of today?
4434000	4439000	That is the mindset of these people, and that is just not at all the mindset of the historian.
4439000	4441000	And it comes back to power, doesn't it?
4441000	4444000	Yes, it comes back to being corrupted by power.
4444000	4450000	And so, you know, the mistake that people who have a problem with this system often make is they imitate it.
4450000	4457000	And they say, well, you know, here's my new history of the American Revolution that's, like, useful for the opposite reason.
4457000	4465000	And that's not, like, that is also doing a grave disservice to the people, you know, these are real people who fought, you know, in this war.
4465000	4477000	And, you know, if you look at any war in history, you should be able to understand and empathize with both sides and feel and understand why both sides thought that they were fighting for what they thought was right.
4477000	4485000	If you can't do that for any conflict, okay, individuals can be psychopaths, but you can't necessarily identify with a crazy individual.
4485000	4490000	But if you can't identify with a group of individuals, it just means you don't understand them.
4490000	4504000	Well put. And this kind of brings us to your recent idea about the Clear Pill, in a way, because I see, especially your recent ratings, as it's almost as if you're trying to debunk ideas on the left and the right.
4504000	4512000	I think one of the, yeah, so basically the goal of this series, which I'm currently plug, plug, plug writing at the Claremont Institute's American Mind blog.
4512000	4519000	That's kind of the American Mind is, if you don't mind me saying so, kind of the second tier publication of the Claremont Institute.
4519000	4522000	If it was really prestigious, I'd be in the Claremont Review books.
4522000	4527000	But maybe I aspire to that. Or maybe I don't.
4528000	4535000	But, you know, the American Mind, the editors of that have done a really great job of kind of reaching out to kind of interesting new thinkers.
4535000	4538000	Certainly, you know, probably people more interesting than myself.
4538000	4552000	And the, and so the goal of this series is basically, you know, I would say if I made, you know, and I wrote like a few hundred thousand words in that damn blog.
4552000	4568000	So I made a lot of mistakes, but I think if I made any kind of strategic mistakes in kind of how to think about this problem, it was the idea that sort of the cure for the present way of thinking and the way you should be thinking instead were one thing.
4568000	4572000	And I don't think they're one thing and they can't really be understood as one thing.
4572000	4583000	The thing is that whether you're, you know, a progressive or a Nazi or a constitutional conservative or something else, I suppose there must be something else I can't think of it.
4583000	4598000	Maybe a centrist pragmatist. You basically are kind of attached to a particular way of seeing the current world that I would say contains certain contradictions.
4598000	4611000	And, you know, the way that you want to always carry out in kind of an intervention, whether it's a personal intervention or a political intervention is to say, let's think about these contradictions and what you think.
4611000	4625000	It's like my example of like democracy versus politics. I'm like, I'm just asking you a question. I'm like, if you can explain the difference why, how democracy can be good and politics can be bad, but they're both the same thing, then you have no need of my products.
4626000	4633000	You must know something I don't, because I feel like I know the explanation and it's a pretty darn complicated explanation.
4633000	4646000	And, but sort of before you make that explanation, basically, you know, you have these kinds of attachments to these causes, these issues, even these individuals, these parties, these cultural groups, which are very, very emotional.
4646000	4653000	You know, it's like being a Lakers fan or something, probably some Lakers fans in the room. Let's have a moment for Kobe.
4653000	4675000	All right. And the, and yet you know that there's sort of nothing rational about being a Lakers fan, that it's actually kind of stimulating this sort of political instinct, this thymos, this desire to be relevant and powerful, which ends up in like team spirit and like, you know, just cheering mindlessly in front of the TV.
4675000	4689000	Again, the pornography analogy suggests itself. And so in a way, I'm basically like, you know, to kind of take that analogy a little bit further, I'm like, all right, young men, let's face it, you want to get laid.
4689000	4702000	The first thing you have to do, like the way you're thinking of getting laid is basically, how do I meet the girls on the porn site? That is basically the way you currently think about politics.
4702000	4717000	Okay. So they basically the way people on the left or the right or both, really both. And in order for you to basically have like this kind of normal romantic life, like a normal person, you know, the kind of the first step is to just give up your porn.
4717000	4722000	So I'm basically going to go through all these different kinds of porn and I'm going to explain why it's not realistic.
4723000	4736000	And so that's kind of the purpose of the series in a way to basically say, okay, you know, as a progressive, you know, this is part two, I'm not under the illusion that many progressives will read it, but there are a lot of them, so some will.
4736000	4748000	And I'm like, here is kind of what's going on in your head when this stuff excites you. And maybe it's like, if you think a little harder, this is not the thing that you should be into.
4748000	4763000	And then basically the same and it's a very different story for why constitutional conservatism is hopeless and should give up. And then another one for why white nationalist Nazis or whatever you want to call them are hopeless and should give up.
4763000	4774000	And so, you know, when you basically said, hey, you know, all of these things are hopeless. I'm like, imagine, you know, all these things are hopeless. Everyone is trying to change things and nothing is changing.
4775000	4790000	You know, that kind of fits together in a way. And so to detach people from these kind of false, you know, very false kinds of systems, first of all, it's a service, you know, in itself, you know, the way I think about, you know, how should you think about politics or power?
4790000	4803000	Let's say that, okay, you're probably an American. Let's say you moved to Costa Rica. You become an expat in Costa Rica. What is your attitude toward Costa Rican elections and the Costa Rican government?
4803000	4813000	Do you consider that this government has no right to rule over you because you did not consent to it? Do you not obey the speed limit? No. You obey the Costa Rican law because you live in Costa Rica.
4813000	4823000	Do you vote in Costa Rican elections? Do you want to vote in Costa Rican elections? Do you like notice it in anything more than a practical way? No, then you're sort of completely detached.
4823000	4834000	And that level of kind of detachment from the desire to change the world is very, very difficult. But paradoxically, I believe it's what's necessary if you're actually going to change the world.
4834000	4836000	That's seriously fucked up.
4836000	4841000	No, that's something that you and I definitely agree on. I come from a more kind of left-wing trajectory and you from a more right-wing trajectory.
4841000	4855000	But I think it's a fair to say that you and I probably agree on something like the proposition that true intellectuals, whether they be artists or writers or philosophers or scientists, if what you're really looking for is true disinterested truth-seeking,
4855000	4867000	one must, A, detach from power and any dreams or hopes of having power or political efficacy, and B, it's probably going to be in some weird nether region beyond left and right.
4867000	4872000	Yeah, I mean, again, you use these words left and right. These are very complicated words.
4872000	4874000	But that's my point, right? They're not really good.
4875000	4892000	I would say that a more immediate problem, I would say what people normally mean when they say left and right is simply competing cultural groups that are essentially competing ethnic religions almost in a way.
4892000	4905000	And one of my strongest beliefs is that if this country ever functions again or has a government that functions again or at least maybe can test people for the coronavirus, I think they're getting around to that.
4905000	4919000	The difference in capacity between this country and China in that is remarkable. I mean, frankly, next week I wouldn't be here and you all would be wearing masks.
4920000	4935000	But I wouldn't be here. And maybe I'm wrong. But I think that's the case and it's very possible that you're going to see the level of state capacity that we have in this country compared very directly.
4935000	4955000	And if you're ever at a point where basically this country actually works and functions as a country, I think it's going to involve, like, I think one of the most striking things about right versus left is I think one of the main reasons that people support either side is fear of the other.
4956000	4970000	The main reason that people feel passionate about being leftists is they have the sense that they're defending this little dot of light of civilization against this horde of ignorant peasants.
4970000	4983000	And anyone who has grown up with that feeling knows that sense that we are the enlightened few and the masses out there are coming with burning pitchforks to spear us.
4983000	4991000	And this is in the modern world a ridiculous fear, but historically this is not a ridiculous fear.
4991000	4999000	And so you have this sense of this kind of very deep and bitter loathing between the upper class and the middle class.
4999000	5005000	Most people call when they say middle class they say lower middle class and when they say mean upper class they say middle class.
5005000	5011000	But basically between the professional managerial classes and anti-woke leftists would put it.
5011000	5017000	And what would you call the Trump voters, the Pearls, would you say Pearls?
5017000	5019000	Don't say the Pluribals.
5019000	5023000	That's a good question. I don't think you could say Pearls. Pearls is much more general left and right.
5023000	5026000	There are Bernie supporters that are Pearls?
5026000	5032000	No, there are Bernie supporters that are Pearls but they're not cultural Pearls or they wouldn't be Bernie supporters.
5032000	5041000	This identification of class stratification with your bank account is one of the characteristic distortions of leftism.
5041000	5043000	It's all about culture.
5043000	5048000	If you've ever been a grad student and some fellow grad student because his stipend is low is like I'm poor.
5048000	5051000	And it's like no, you're not poor, you're broke.
5051000	5053000	And those are just very different things.
5053000	5061000	And so like status is a much more important determination of class than salary or bank account.
5061000	5069000	And it's definitely a status conflict between essentially, well if you'll allow me to use Marxist terminology,
5069000	5076000	you have the professional managerial class of the Pearls and what Marx would call the lump and proletariat.
5077000	5085000	And so there's this sort of alliance of the ruling class and the lump and proletariat which is basically...
5085000	5087000	The Democratic Party.
5087000	5089000	You could call it that.
5089000	5094000	And I really hate using these like code words.
5094000	5096000	Like they just become inflammatory.
5096000	5101000	And it's like at least you said Democratic Party.
5101000	5104000	If you'd said Democrat Party, that would have meant you were on Fox News.
5105000	5112000	And my stepfather is a longstanding Hill staffer on the Democratic side.
5112000	5116000	If you want to get him to explode at dinner, just say Democrat Party.
5116000	5118000	Which obviously I would never do.
5118000	5124000	But the thing is, my point is that basically if anything is ever going to actually work in this country,
5124000	5130000	it basically can only be as an alliance of all three of these classes.
5130000	5137000	You cannot imagine any successful government that is like a government of like one over the others.
5137000	5148000	And so for me kind of the big political historical question is to just take a really grand scope.
5148000	5152000	Are we in the late Roman Republic or the late Roman Empire?
5152000	5156000	So if we're in the late Roman Empire, we're absolutely completely fucked.
5156000	5161000	And there are certainly many kind of parallels that you can draw between, for example,
5161000	5167000	the intellectual class that Justin was part of and like the grammarian ruling class of the late Roman Empire.
5167000	5172000	You might have seen this class kind of parodied in a certain Monty Python movie.
5172000	5177000	And really like just completely worthless people.
5177000	5179000	But very well educated.
5179000	5183000	And just useless against the Huns or whatever.
5183000	5187000	And or are we in the late Roman Republic?
5187000	5191000	And that's a very optimistic, you know, most people are like, oh my god, it's like the late Roman Republic.
5191000	5194000	I'm like, that's actually the optimistic perspective.
5194000	5199000	And so one of the things about the Roman Republic, if you know like the kind of kindergarten version of the Roman Republic,
5199000	5207000	you know that the whole history of the Republic is this conflict between, first it's the plebeians and patricians,
5207000	5216000	then those categories kind of become obsolete and it's the optimates versus the popularis, right?
5216000	5221000	Which is basically optimates versus popularis is Bernie versus Trump.
5221000	5223000	It's as simple as that.
5223000	5227000	And you're like, okay, how does this work out?
5227000	5229000	It's true that they have some civil wars.
5229000	5235000	I don't believe that civil war is possible today, which is another very optimistic perspective, which I will defend.
5235000	5243000	But I just don't believe in violent politics at all, which is very optimistic.
5243000	5251000	But the outcome of this is even more optimistic, which is that it kind of magically ends up with Augustus,
5251000	5254000	the first Roman Empire, previously Octavian.
5254000	5257000	And Augustus is actually success.
5257000	5264000	And one of the features of the Roman Empire is this whole conflict between red states and blue states.
5264000	5274000	Popularis and optimates, whatever, this whole civil conflict, which had been part of the fabric of the Roman Republic for 400 years,
5274000	5277000	something like that, not an expert here, disappears.
5277000	5279000	It's gone.
5279000	5281000	It's never heard of again.
5281000	5286000	So, you know, if you could imagine basically an America in which there's no like red state, blue state conflict,
5286000	5293000	no race war, none of this garbage, like, you know, okay, what would you trade for that?
5293000	5295000	I think a lot of people would trade.
5295000	5300000	Like, you know, I think a lot of people would be ready to make, you know, pretty large sacrifices for that.
5300000	5302000	So in a way, like, you know, what happened exactly?
5302000	5303000	How did that come about?
5303000	5304000	Augustus.
5304000	5305000	Have you heard of the guy?
5305000	5306000	Yeah, heard of him.
5306000	5308000	But of course, I know everything you're talking about.
5308000	5314000	But for our audience, you know, please, please, please remind them of a few of the details.
5314000	5316000	Okay, well, let's see.
5316000	5318000	A quick rundown, if you will.
5318000	5324000	You know, maybe in Roman history, like Trump versus Bloomberg is like Marius versus Sulla.
5324000	5329000	So essentially what happens is one side wins the Civil War.
5329000	5337000	But the side that wins the Civil War is not really, you know, it's like Caesar, who's the one who actually wins,
5337000	5340000	and Caesar and Augustus have much the same plans.
5340000	5344000	Caesar just wasn't really careful about his personal security.
5344000	5356000	But they were basically both, they both had the style of unifiers.
5356000	5361000	And they were, and by the way, they didn't claim to have abolished the Republic at all.
5361000	5363000	They claimed to have restored and fixed the Republic.
5363000	5366000	You know, they were just the first citizen of the Republic.
5366000	5369000	And, you know, everything was voted on by the Senate.
5369000	5371000	Of course, the Senate was a rubber stamp.
5372000	5379000	But, you know, they never restored the title of Rex, of the title of King, which was an old Roman, you know, title.
5379000	5384000	You know, the last Kings of Rome were driven out in like 500-something BC, right?
5384000	5391000	So they're like, we have saved the Republic, but what we've created in practice is effectively a monarchy.
5391000	5397000	So in some ways, Augustus is actually more like FDR than you might think.
5397000	5402000	And so, you know, let's imagine like, you know, Bloomberg doing a new, new deal.
5402000	5406000	And, you know, like, it's a ridiculous, it could never happen.
5406000	5414000	But, you know, the thing is that, you know, Augustus's Rome, like FDR's Washington, was a start-up nation.
5414000	5421000	Because it was under the absolute control of this guy, Augustus, who was absolutely competent and completely effective,
5421000	5425000	and had no interest in continuing any of these squabbles.
5425000	5428000	So there's this great story, it's about Caesar rather than Augustus.
5428000	5437000	And I think it sort of expresses the kind of attitude that's kind of necessary in creating kind of anything new and awesome.
5437000	5443000	Of course, you know, nothing happens without, not violence, but force.
5443000	5446000	So, you know, Caesar's force comes from the popularis.
5446000	5448000	He's originally a man of the popularis.
5448000	5452000	So, you know, he fights the Civil War, and he's fighting against Cato.
5452000	5455000	And Cato is, like, everyone super respects Cato.
5455000	5463000	Cato is, like, imagine, like, some, like, really old-line, you know, Democrat who, like, really believes in the process, really believes in the Republic.
5463000	5465000	It's not cynical at all.
5465000	5469000	You know, this is a person who just completely believes in the system.
5469000	5470000	That's Cato.
5470000	5474000	And so, you know, Cato gets beat.
5474000	5477000	And, you know, he does this very Roman thing.
5477000	5479000	He commits seppuku, actually.
5479000	5487000	He does this, like, Japanese suicide ritual, and actually cuts his belly with his sword and, like, tears his own intestines out.
5487000	5493000	And his slaves try to push them back in, and he tears them back out again.
5493000	5494000	Super gory.
5494000	5496000	And would make a great movie.
5496000	5499000	And so, Cato is beaten, right?
5499000	5503000	But Caesar basically captures Cato's headquarters.
5503000	5506000	And in Cato's tent, there's a big chest.
5506000	5510000	And the chest is full of letters from his supporters in Rome.
5510000	5524000	So, one of the things about these conflicts in Roman history, and you see this extensively in kind of the preludes to that final civil war between, like, Marius and Sulla, is something called proscription.
5524000	5532000	And that idea of proscription is when you win one of these contests, you basically are like, okay, who are the wealthy supporters of the other side?
5532000	5536000	We are going to kill them and take their property and give it to our friends.
5536000	5539000	I think standard supporters are getting excited listening to you.
5539000	5540000	Yeah, right, right.
5540000	5547000	So, you know, imagine if, like, Trump wins the election, he throws Soros in jail, he takes all of Soros' money and redistributes it to, like, megatards.
5547000	5548000	Right?
5548000	5549000	If you'll excuse my French.
5549000	5556000	You know, so, this would be a very aggressive action by Donald Trump, but that was absolutely normal in Roman politics.
5556000	5560000	So, basically, a completely normal, expected thing to do.
5560000	5566000	So, you know, Caesar's guys basically find this chest and they're like, holy shit, you won't believe what we found.
5566000	5568000	Because we're like, this is the mother load.
5568000	5571000	Because, of course, a lot of these motherfuckers would write letters to both sides.
5571000	5579000	It'd be like, Kato, man, you're the one, you're really strong, you know, you have these Roman values, and then they'd be like, Caesar, oh my god, you're so Caesar.
5579000	5583000	Right, you know, and so they'd write the same letter to both sides.
5583000	5588000	So, you know, these are the people that you really want to find because these are not your guys, right, that you can't trust them.
5588000	5590000	And you really want to kill them and take their property.
5590000	5593000	And then there are the guys who are just against you.
5593000	5595000	And you definitely want to kill them and take their property.
5595000	5598000	So, you know, Caesar's guys are super hot to try it, right?
5598000	5599000	And they're like, what do we do?
5599000	5601000	How do we start working through this?
5601000	5611000	Caesar's like, okay, take the chest of letters, put it on a bunch of logs, pour olive oil on it, and set it on fire.
5611000	5613000	These guys are like, what?
5613000	5615000	Caesar's like, you don't get it.
5615000	5617000	Like motherfuckers, we won.
5617000	5619000	They're all our guys now.
5619000	5629000	And so, you know, that sense of basically they're all our guys now is basically essential to anything that actually works.
5629000	5645000	And so, you know, that's obviously very far from this vision of peasants with red-hot pitchforks visiting the University of Southampton, I guess, to basically toss you on their devilish burning tines.
5646000	5657000	And it's that absolute opposite, but it also doesn't mean, you know, you must, you know, hound and harry the peasants and, you know, basically go full Spartan on them.
5657000	5667000	And, you know, which is really, I think in many ways, the attitude of not necessarily the, you know, there's definitely, I don't know when I say go full Spartan.
5667000	5676000	One of the things the Spartan elite like to do is basically if you were like a young Spartan, like, you know, ruling class, like, you know, like Chapa Dude or whatever,
5676000	5689000	you would basically imagine if like Chapa Dudes like had like secret Chapa parties where they went and like just found like drove out to the suburbs and found like some like Magadude with like a maga sign in front of his hat and just house and just like burned his house down and killed him.
5689000	5693000	That would be like the Spartan way of being a ruling class, right?
5693000	5696000	And, you know, I think there's people that like to do that.
5697000	5700000	And I'm very confident of it.
5700000	5713000	And so that like, you know, that mentality is a very dark and evil mentality, which in a way very much parallels the mentality of the average school shooter today.
5713000	5717000	You know, and I can say average school shooter because frankly, there's a lot of them.
5717000	5724000	And so you kind of see this kind of, you know, like these pathological phenomena emerging out of this conflict.
5724000	5726000	And I think it's a very pathological conflict.
5726000	5730000	And I'm certainly, I mean, you know, these are very, you know, banal sentiments.
5730000	5734000	Everybody's going to agree with that. Nobody's going to agree with basically how you get out of it.
5734000	5736000	Right. No, that's interesting.
5736000	5741000	So what I want to do in just a minute is open it up to audience questions shortly.
5741000	5746000	But if you have just a little bit more steam Curtis, I thought I'd maybe ask you one or two more questions.
5746000	5747000	Sure.
5747000	5751000	And specifically, I'd like to ask you about some of the bigger ideas in your writings.
5751000	5753000	I don't think there's any really big ideas.
5753000	5755000	I don't really have any ideas at all, actually.
5755000	5758000	Well, I can ask you and then you can answer that.
5758000	5759000	Sure.
5759000	5761000	That's how you'd like to answer that you're more than welcome to.
5761000	5765000	Because we've talked a lot up until now about debunking various ideas on the left and the right.
5765000	5767000	And I think you're very good at that.
5767000	5773000	But if one reads your blog on qualified reservations closely and there's a lot of it to read, but I have read most of it.
5773000	5777000	One does see certain big ideas, more positive ideas, I think, more positive visions.
5777000	5779000	I disagree very strongly.
5779000	5783000	I think that the really important content there is purely negative.
5783000	5789000	It's basically the most important thing is an absence of belief.
5789000	5794000	There are probably some positive ideas behind it, but you should really focus on the absence of belief.
5794000	5795000	Well, let me give you an example.
5795000	5800000	And while I'm asking you just one or two questions about what I see as the bigger positive ideas in your writing,
5800000	5804000	the audience, you all should be thinking about good questions to ask if you're interested to ask any.
5804000	5806000	And I'll turn to you in just a minute.
5806000	5808000	So one would be formalism, for instance.
5808000	5809000	Right.
5809000	5813000	This is how you describe your political philosophy in one word.
5813000	5816000	I think it's kind of the most efficient way you describe your political philosophy.
5816000	5820000	And if I understand it correctly, I'll give people just a very quick and dirty summary of the idea.
5820000	5822000	And you can clarify if you need to or what have you.
5822000	5824000	But then I want to ask you about it.
5824000	5830000	The way I understand it is pretty much, Curtis seems to be of the viewpoint that one of the biggest problems in,
5830000	5837000	especially American politics today, is a bad mapping between the actual distribution of power
5837000	5842000	and how power is actually acknowledged or formalized or labeled.
5842000	5847000	Where power actually exists is distributed and messy, and no one's really honest about it.
5847000	5856000	Whereas the idea of formalism is that if we could simply account rigorously for who has power and where power is had,
5856000	5861000	and that's done formally in a way that's rigorous, that this would solve a lot of problems perhaps.
5861000	5862000	Sure.
5862000	5865000	So yeah, I think that's pretty much mostly right.
5865000	5870000	I would recommend, if anyone out there likes books, one of the great,
5870000	5876000	possibly the greatest work of political science in the 20th century is a book called The Machiavellians by a writer named James Burnham.
5876000	5879000	It's not his most famous book, but it's his best book.
5879000	5887000	Burnham was originally a trotskiest of all things, and like many trotskiests, he found himself a right winger.
5887000	5890000	Maybe the world moved under him, maybe he moved, maybe both.
5890000	5897000	He wrote this wonderful book called The Machiavellians, which is a summary of what's called the, in English,
5897000	5903000	sometimes called the Italian School of Political Science, which is over 100 years old.
5903000	5907000	And it's classic, it's a great figure, really.
5907000	5913000	A guy on a par with Newton and Darwin, in my mind, is a guy named Guy Tanamoska, who's completely unknown.
5913000	5919000	He wrote a book called Elements of Political Science, which somehow got into the English title of Theory of the Ruling Class.
5919000	5923000	I think of it as Elements of Political Science, because that's actually his title.
5923000	5931000	If you just read Burnham's very incisive summary of it, that basically gives the basic idea that Justin was just trying to express,
5931000	5940000	is essentially that many, in fact, most political systems in the real world have this divergence between formal power,
5940000	5946000	like how the system is actually supposed to work, and objective power, as in terms of who's actually in charge.
5946000	5950000	It's like, you know, a very simple way to think about this is like Elizabeth II.
5950000	5954000	So Elizabeth II has, you know, kind of nominal authority.
5954000	5956000	Actually, she can veto legislation.
5956000	5960000	Most people didn't know that she has the same power as the president, she can veto an act of parliament.
5960000	5966000	The last time an English monarch vetoed an act of parliament, 1707, I think, under Queen Anne.
5966000	5974000	So, you know, in theory she has it, just like in theory Donald Trump can tell the Justice Department who to prosecute and who not to prosecute,
5974000	5977000	but in practice that would be taken as a gross violation.
5977000	5987000	And so the reality of power and the formal legal reality of power and the objective reality of power have become diverged.
5987000	5990000	And that's very, very common historically.
5990000	5994000	The Emperor of Japan has not been the Emperor of Japan for over a thousand years.
5994000	5999000	I think something that might not be clear to people or not obvious to people is why is this such a problem,
5999000	6003000	and why would formalizing that distribution of power be so good?
6003000	6012000	When you formalize the distribution of power, because basically one of the main benefit for the powerful of this divergence between appearance and reality
6012000	6021000	is that when the reality is powerless and basically symbolic, when the appearance is powerless and basically symbolic,
6021000	6027000	then the reality is unaccountable, because no one thinks of it as an organ with power.
6027000	6033000	And this is especially effective if it's decentralized, like any oligarchy.
6033000	6042000	So there's a great example in 7th century France of the Merovingian and the Carolingian kings.
6042000	6052000	So the Merovingian dynasty are like these long-haired barbarians who conquer Roman Gaul and establish themselves as king.
6052000	6056000	And of course originally they're badasses, they're like Germanic warriors, right?
6057000	6064000	But over time they come to develop a taste for civilization, and they basically turn into the French word,
6064000	6069000	I can't speak French as quafanien, which means do nothing king literally.
6069000	6078000	So these kings who are like Clovis the 4th or 5th or 6th or whatever become like Elizabeth the 2nd.
6078000	6086000	Unusually however, the force holding real power is the figure called the mayor of the palace who was originally just a permanent bureaucrat.
6086000	6089000	He's basically the deep state of Merovingian France.
6089000	6092000	But the deep state of Merovingian France is actually a monarchy.
6092000	6096000	Imagine if the deep state had a boss, there was like a chief deep state person.
6096000	6098000	Like that would be the mayor of the palace, right?
6098000	6105000	And so eventually the mayor of the palace is just like fuck it, I'm running things, and literally what does the king do?
6105000	6110000	Literally I like bring him out in an ox cart every six months to read a speech I wrote.
6110000	6113000	Fuck this, it's over, it's done, he's not the king anymore.
6113000	6117000	I'm the king, and this is how this is the origin of Charlemagne.
6117000	6118000	You've heard of Charlemagne?
6118000	6120000	Like there's a rapper I think with that.
6122000	6124000	This is the origin of Charlemagne, right?
6124000	6129000	And so basically here you see actually a real monarchy and a shadow monarchy at the same time.
6129000	6133000	And the great thing about being the mayor of the palace is like it's like being the deep state.
6133000	6134000	You're completely unaccountable.
6135000	6139000	Which is absolutely great if you're you, right?
6139000	6147000	And so in a sense, essentially you might remember originally that I said that this country was not a democracy
6147000	6149000	and I didn't think it should be a democracy.
6149000	6154000	You have this very, very, you know, these very unaccountable permanent structures,
6154000	6158000	some of which are in the formal government and some of which are outside of it.
6158000	6159000	So here's another example.
6159000	6164000	Suppose you basically, you're like okay there's this thing called the mainstream media.
6164000	6167000	You might have heard that term in like Breitbart or something.
6167000	6172000	You know, to someone who's part of it of course you wouldn't say that, you would just say the press.
6172000	6174000	The free, the free press, right?
6174000	6182000	And when you look at this free press you're like okay I can identify that certain institutions are part of the press
6182000	6183000	and certain or not.
6183000	6185000	Like what does it mean to be a journalist?
6185000	6186000	Is that a formal title?
6186000	6189000	Do I go like get out on my like airline tickets?
6189000	6192000	Do I say, you know, J instead of mister as a journalist?
6192000	6197000	No, but yet there's some sense in which it's official.
6197000	6199000	There's some sense in which the New York Times is official.
6199000	6202000	Well, you know, without really changing the way the New York Times operates,
6202000	6205000	you could say we're going to take the Times, you know, and the Post
6205000	6209000	and we're going to call them part of the federal government.
6209000	6211000	They're not going to change the way they operate at all.
6211000	6214000	We're just going to call them the Department of Information
6214000	6217000	and we're going to call them paper number one and paper number two.
6217000	6222000	And then they're going to, instead of thinking themselves as public servants,
6222000	6226000	they'll be civil servants, have exactly the same immunity,
6226000	6231000	have exactly the same free access to government secrets which they then sell to the public.
6231000	6237000	And you're like not only is the Department of Information clearly a real part of the government,
6237000	6239000	it's actually the most powerful part of the government.
6239000	6241000	It's actually completely unaccountable.
6241000	6243000	And you know what else is cool about the New York Times?
6243000	6249000	You know, I was having this discussion confidentially with a journalist who should not be named.
6249000	6252000	I only talked to journalists off the record.
6252000	6259000	And I was like, you know, there's a difference between Jeff Bezos' relationship to the Washington Post
6259000	6265000	and the Salzburgers' family's relationship to the New York Times
6265000	6271000	because Arthur Salzburger's punch or whatever the fuck they call him is actually part of the news desk.
6271000	6275000	And if he tells the journalists, hey, I think, or the editors,
6275000	6280000	hey, I think you need to steer things in this direction or that direction, they'll listen to him.
6280000	6286000	If Jeff Bezos tells the Post, oh, I don't think I really like how you're covering this story.
6286000	6290000	You know what the answer of any self-respecting postjournalist is going to be?
6290000	6295000	I quit. I'm going to go work for the New York Times, which is a real newspaper.
6295000	6298000	And do you know how the New York Times is governed?
6298000	6300000	How?
6300000	6303000	It's an absolute hereditary monarchy.
6303000	6305000	Mmm.
6305000	6307000	Mmm.
6307000	6311000	Based.
6311000	6313000	Yes.
6313000	6314000	All right.
6314000	6315000	Definitely not cringe.
6315000	6321000	So the last question I want to ask you before we turn it off to this very patient audience that is sat.
6321000	6323000	Thank you for sitting through all this ridiculous bullshit.
6323000	6326000	Quietly and wrapped.
6326000	6328000	Let's talk about soft corpse real quick.
6328000	6331000	This is, I think, one of your other big ideas that you're kind of known for.
6331000	6333000	Sort of an old big idea.
6333000	6341000	Both formalism and soft corpse are kind of like, as I was writing this piece, I was, you know, as I was writing this blog,
6341000	6344000	of course, I'm thinking at the same time.
6344000	6349000	And so some of my kinds of perspectives, I mean, I don't disagree with these ideas at all.
6349000	6351000	I just emphasize them a little differently.
6351000	6352000	Sure.
6352000	6357000	Well, the idea of the soft corpse, which many people will, you know, remember if they've read your blog,
6357000	6360000	is, there you go, take that shot.
6360000	6361000	Oh, sip on the whiskey.
6361000	6362000	I thought you were going to throw it back.
6362000	6364000	We're almost done here.
6364000	6365000	We're almost done here.
6365000	6366000	No, we have to take shots.
6366000	6368000	You've got to get loose for audience questions, that's for sure.
6368000	6369000	All right.
6369000	6370000	All right.
6370000	6371000	All right.
6371000	6372000	All right.
6372000	6373000	Sure is.
6373000	6374000	Skull.
6374000	6381000	The idea of soft corpse, as I understand it, you paint a portrait of a possible political world in which
6381000	6388000	a very, very large number of relatively small governance structures or polities.
6388000	6390000	This is sometimes known as patchwork.
6390000	6392000	This is an idea that a lot of people are actually quite interested in right now.
6392000	6395000	This is an idea that a lot of people have separately had independently.
6395000	6400000	Of course, yeah, I'm not saying you invented or anything, but in your vision of patchwork,
6400000	6407000	there would be a kind of governance structure or a kind of polity in which pretty much the
6407000	6411000	government owns a piece of territory and runs it like a business.
6411000	6413000	This is the way it already works, actually.
6413000	6415000	It's just done really badly.
6415000	6417000	So it's closely related to formalism.
6417000	6423000	Yeah, so if you imagine one of the things I strongly believe in is whenever you're talking
6423000	6428000	about a group or an entity, you should always use the term that that group uses to refer
6428000	6430000	to itself.
6430000	6436000	So in Washington, if you're writing about the US government, you will say either USG
6436000	6439000	or the USG either is acceptable.
6439000	6444000	And actually, coincidentally, there's a company called USG, United States Gypsum,
6444000	6446000	which is like traded on the stock exchange, right?
6446000	6447000	But they're not the same thing.
6447000	6454000	But in essence, what you're looking at when you're looking at a government is a corporation
6454000	6456000	that owns a country.
6456000	6457000	It just is.
6457000	6458000	It's the same thing.
6458000	6462000	It just sort of has this really strange governance structure.
6462000	6467000	If you can imagine a corporation governed the way the United States is governed.
6467000	6470000	Imagine if Apple had a Congress and a Supreme Court.
6470000	6472000	Maybe it had separation of powers.
6472000	6476000	So Congress would be like marketing and the executive branch would be like engineering
6476000	6479000	and be like, you have to separate marketing and engineering.
6479000	6481000	And then the Supreme Court is like HR.
6481000	6485000	I mean, you could imagine doing it that way.
6485000	6487000	But I don't think it would make very good phones.
6488000	6493000	And one of the things that's most remarkable about the way people think about politics
6493000	6500000	and democracy today is probably most people here got here in a car.
6500000	6502000	Did you get here in a car?
6502000	6504000	Well, who built that car?
6504000	6505000	I'm like, well, there's a very simple answer.
6505000	6511000	That car was built by a monarchy because it was built by a corporation with a CEO
6511000	6516000	who is essentially in absolute control of that organization.
6516000	6518000	Yet also accountable.
6518000	6520000	I'll get to that in a second.
6520000	6522000	But, you know, you drive a car.
6522000	6524000	It was built by a monarchy.
6524000	6526000	You eat at a restaurant.
6526000	6527000	It's a monarchy.
6527000	6530000	Anyone ever seen Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares?
6530000	6531000	Amazing show.
6531000	6532000	It's really, it's not about cooking.
6532000	6533000	It's about management.
6533000	6535000	It's about power and about government.
6535000	6540000	And, you know, I realize that Gordon Ramsey is not eligible to be president.
6540000	6543000	But I mean, you know, if you want a reality show president,
6543000	6549000	imagine Gordon Ramsey going through, like, the State Department's fridge.
6549000	6554000	You'd be like, you're, well, yeah, I see you sitting $500 million to this guy.
6554000	6555000	Wow.
6555000	6557000	Who is this person?
6557000	6559000	What is this doing in this drawer?
6559000	6563000	You know, so, you know, you could imagine that very easily, right?
6563000	6566000	And if you've seen the show, it's a very good show.
6566000	6568000	The British one is better.
6568000	6574000	But that's very easy to, like, once you start seeing that equivalence,
6574000	6578000	you're like, okay, you know, I got here in a car built by a monarchy.
6578000	6580000	I ate a restaurant built by a monarchy.
6580000	6583000	I stayed at a hotel run by a monarchy.
6583000	6587000	You know, I went and sent a letter at a post office.
6587000	6589000	Oh, you know.
6589000	6593000	And so there's this kind of massive contrast that everyone sees, right?
6593000	6596000	And, you know, you could even get, you know, anyone will be like, oh, yeah,
6596000	6599000	benevolent dictatorship is the best, you know, form of government,
6599000	6601000	but how do you make sure it stays benevolent?
6601000	6604000	As though this is like a question that can't be answered.
6604000	6608000	And I'm like, no, actually, I think that's a very interesting question.
6608000	6610000	Maybe it does have an answer.
6610000	6612000	And so, you know, the concept of...
6612000	6614000	And the answer is to make them compete?
6614000	6619000	The answer is, the answer is, I would say, as generally as possible.
6619000	6623000	If you look at what, you know, your car, you know, your restaurant,
6623000	6627000	and, you know, Elizabethan England have in common,
6627000	6632000	they are all what I would call accountable monarchies.
6632000	6634000	And so, you know, let's take Augustus.
6634000	6637000	We talked about Augustus earlier, like Augustus saved Rome.
6637000	6641000	Everyone in Augustus's Rome is just like, oh, my God, I'm so glad that was over.
6641000	6644000	I could never even imagine it being over, and yet it's over.
6644000	6646000	This is wonderful.
6646000	6648000	That is the unanimous sentiment.
6648000	6651000	Augustus is, you know, a supremely competent dude.
6651000	6653000	He does fine.
6653000	6658000	Augustus's successor is Tiberius.
6658000	6660000	There's some questions about Tiberius.
6660000	6662000	You know, this is weird.
6662000	6664000	Yeah, episode with Seginus.
6664000	6668000	After Tiberius comes a name that you might recognize.
6668000	6670000	Caligula.
6670000	6672000	After Caligula, you get Claudius.
6672000	6674000	He's kind of a nerdy weirdo.
6674000	6677000	After Claudius, you get Nero, right?
6677000	6681000	And so, in a way, when people think about monarchies, you know,
6681000	6683000	that wasn't quite a hereditary monarchy.
6683000	6685000	It had weird things going on.
6685000	6688000	Hereditary monarchies can have this just like monstrous failure mode
6688000	6690000	where it's like Henry VI.
6690000	6692000	Shakespeare wrote to Henry VI plays.
6692000	6694000	You had an incompetent king of England.
6694000	6696000	It resulted in the wars of the roses.
6696000	6699000	Massive devastation, right?
6699000	6702000	And so, you know, and anyone, even if you're like Steve Jobs,
6702000	6704000	you're like this amazing king of Apple, right?
6704000	6708000	You know, Apple succeeded because Apple is sort of more truly a monarchy
6708000	6710000	than any other corporation.
6710000	6712000	And because of that, it made the most amazing phones.
6712000	6715000	And they've kept that up, even without Jobs.
6715000	6718000	You know, but, you know, suppose Steve Jobs,
6718000	6721000	instead of getting a pancreatic tumor, gets a brain tumor.
6721000	6723000	He goes nuts.
6723000	6726000	He's like, no, your next phone has to be big.
6726000	6728000	Big! I want a big phone, right?
6728000	6730000	You know, he goes nuts.
6730000	6732000	And who can say no?
6732000	6736000	No, we can't sell a phone that is the size of an easel, right?
6736000	6740000	And no one has the right or the power to tell him that.
6740000	6742000	And so, he has to be accountable.
6742000	6745000	And so, in a way, one of the kind of tragedies
6745000	6748000	of the modern democratic form of government,
6748000	6750000	one thing most people don't know about the title of president,
6750000	6752000	I'm pretty sure I'm right about this.
6752000	6753000	I hope I'm not wrong.
6753000	6755000	But even if I'm wrong, it's a good story.
6755000	6757000	President is actually originally, you know,
6757000	6759000	it's used as a corporate title and a political title.
6759000	6763000	You imagine that the corporate title is like a copy of the political title.
6763000	6764000	Not so.
6764000	6767000	It was actually a corporate title before it was a political title.
6767000	6769000	And one of the things about the Puritans,
6769000	6771000	who basically founded the Republic,
6771000	6775000	they were very experienced in forming like trading companies and so forth.
6775000	6778000	And so, the idea of kind of the Congress being,
6778000	6781000	in a way, kind of like a board of directors,
6781000	6785000	in a sense to whom the CEO is accountable,
6785000	6788000	is kind of, it's like almost there in the Constitution,
6788000	6789000	but it's not there.
6789000	6791000	So we have this shit show, right?
6791000	6793000	But it's kind of almost there.
6793000	6795000	And, you know, the modern corporation
6795000	6798000	hadn't really even been invented by the time.
6798000	6801000	You know, it's sort of, there were these kind of prototypical things,
6801000	6806000	but, you know, you get the real modern joint stock corporation in the 19th century.
6806000	6809000	And I'm so crazy, I actually think the Industrial Revolution
6809000	6811000	was actually the corporate revolution.
6811000	6813000	Very unpopular belief, right?
6813000	6816000	You know, because basically people learn how to operate
6816000	6821000	in these effective, these structures that were like states, essentially,
6821000	6824000	but they were like secondary states under the main states.
6824000	6826000	And it was like, you look at like Amazon,
6826000	6829000	Amazon's like 500,000 employees or something,
6829000	6832000	you know, that's enough to govern the world, right?
6832000	6836000	And that, you know, is accountable to this one guy, Jeff Bezos.
6836000	6839000	And like, it's not just, he's not just a figurehead,
6839000	6843000	like it really, you know, Bezos is like a jobs like figure in some ways, right?
6843000	6846000	And so that's kind of the ideal of monarchy.
6846000	6848000	And then, of course, you have Caligula and Nero.
6848000	6851000	So in your model then, in an ideal world,
6851000	6853000	the United States government would be,
6853000	6856000	the distribution of power would be fully formalized.
6856000	6859000	We would turn it into essentially a joint stock corporation
6859000	6863000	in which the power holders would be shareholders in a corporation.
6863000	6867000	And then that corporation would run the country or run the territory for profit.
6867000	6869000	There's a crucial, there's actually, there's a,
6869000	6872000	there's a crucial mistake that you're making, I think.
6872000	6878000	And this is an over, like, this is why I don't really use that terminology anymore,
6878000	6881000	because, you know, what you're saying is right, but it's also wrong.
6881000	6887000	And, you know, the way in which it's wrong is it has this kind of mechanical,
6887000	6890000	it's sort of almost, I think a lot of, you know,
6890000	6894000	the only reason I would recommend not reading my old blog is that
6894000	6898000	I think a lot of the material in it in some ways was kind of designed to be
6898000	6901000	as kind of harsh and off-putting and difficult as possible.
6901000	6903000	You know, which was just kind of...
6903000	6905000	One notices that right away, I think.
6905000	6907000	Yeah, it was just kind of juvenile of me.
6907000	6909000	It's what makes it fun, though.
6909000	6913000	And I would, I for one would definitely recommend you read Curtis's blog.
6913000	6914000	Fine.
6914000	6919000	And the, you know, part of the problem is that this is my free content
6919000	6922000	and I want to write a book that's going to compete with this.
6922000	6926000	And it's just a sheer matter of the grift, Justin.
6926000	6928000	Oh, I get it, I get it.
6928000	6930000	So, like, real artists grift.
6930000	6934000	And the, you know, Samuel Johnson, Samuel...
6934000	6937000	Not Samuel, Samuel Johnson, Samuel Johnson.
6937000	6942000	The, you can see I shouldn't have knocked back that shot.
6942000	6943000	Samuel Johnson...
6943000	6944000	We definitely should have.
6944000	6949000	Samuel Johnson, you know, said, you know, only a fool wrote for anything but money.
6949000	6951000	In that case, I'm definitely a fool.
6951000	6955000	And the...
6955000	6960000	So, yeah, so in a way, the way you stated it is stated in a relatively,
6960000	6963000	in a way that's sort of both off-putting and wrong.
6963000	6967000	And one of the things about, one of the things, most people, like,
6967000	6972000	even people who are, like, you know, like, say, business school professors.
6972000	6975000	And I do know one or two business school, well, at least one business school professor.
6975000	6979000	And even people who are business school professors are basically,
6979000	6984000	in some ways, think of the way corporate governance works in the wrong way
6984000	6987000	because they're like, the shareholders govern the corporation.
6987000	6992000	The reality is having actually been the CEO of a motherfucking corporation,
6992000	7001000	the reality is the CEO is completely in charge but completely accountable to the board.
7001000	7003000	I was my own board, so it was a little different.
7003000	7006000	But if you actually have a board, if you're so unlucky as to actually have a board,
7006000	7008000	you're accountable to that board.
7008000	7015000	But the thing is, if the board gets involved in the governance of your corporation,
7015000	7017000	something is completely fucked.
7017000	7021000	And if the shareholders get involved, something is profoundly fucked
7021000	7024000	and your corporation is almost certain not to survive.
7024000	7029000	Or, like, either your corporation is not going to survive or you are not going to survive.
7029000	7034000	And that is the only reason why shareholders would get involved in, like, shareholder democracy.
7034000	7039000	And so, when you think, when you look at this structure of, like, the shareholders and the board,
7039000	7042000	it's not a management structure, it's not a power structure,
7042000	7048000	it's not actually micromanaging, like, the board of Apple was never second-guessing Steve Jobs' decisions.
7048000	7053000	It fired Steve Jobs once, it was probably prepared to fire him again.
7053000	7058000	And it would have fired him if he'd gotten a brain tumor and started selling phones the size of a fucking window.
7058000	7063000	But it didn't need to do that, and it shouldn't have done that.
7063000	7065000	And so, Steve Jobs was accountable.
7065000	7071000	And the thing is, the mechanism he was accountable to, because it was not actually governing the company,
7071000	7077000	was not actually corrupted by power, because it was not willing power.
7077000	7079000	It was just a backup safety mechanism.
7079000	7085000	And so, the accountability structure in an accountable monarchy is a backup system.
7085000	7091000	It's not actually sort of in power, it's just like, oh, yeah, if things get fucked up, we'll fix it.
7091000	7092000	Makes sense.
7092000	7095000	Makes sense to me. What do you all think?
7095000	7097000	Ladies and gentlemen, Curtis Jarvan.
7097000	7099000	Alright.
