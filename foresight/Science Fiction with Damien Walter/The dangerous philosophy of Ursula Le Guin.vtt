00:00.000 --> 00:09.040
We live in capitalism. Its power seems inescapable. So did the divine right of kings. Any human power

00:09.040 --> 00:17.760
can be resisted and changed by human beings. Resistance and change often begin in art,

00:17.760 --> 00:20.880
very often in our art, the art of the words.

00:24.000 --> 00:29.840
Ursula Croba Le Guin was among the most acclaimed and respected science fiction writers

00:29.840 --> 00:36.400
of the 20th century, a best-selling author in 40 languages, multiple winner of the Hugo and Nebula

00:36.400 --> 00:44.400
Awards, and inspiration to generations who have followed her. Here in the 21st century Le Guin

00:44.400 --> 00:53.040
has become something more than a beloved author. She has become an icon. She may be the only classic

00:53.040 --> 01:01.680
sci-fi writer to regularly trend on TikTok. Ursula Le Guin is one of my favorite authors.

01:01.680 --> 01:08.560
Science fiction is the art that builds worlds. In her science fiction stories, Ursula Le Guin didn't

01:08.560 --> 01:14.960
just tell us a better world was possible, she showed us better worlds by building them in the

01:14.960 --> 01:21.680
imagination of generations, worlds where life is fairer, more equal, and more just.

01:23.440 --> 01:28.960
At this point in time, when a better world seems to be slipping through our fingers,

01:28.960 --> 01:35.040
I want to understand the better worlds that Ursula Le Guin showed us. I want to dig down

01:35.040 --> 01:43.360
to the big ideas that shaped Le Guin's storytelling. I want to understand not just Ursula Le Guin,

01:43.360 --> 01:47.920
the sci-fi writer, but Ursula Le Guin, the philosopher.

01:50.160 --> 01:56.000
Through the medium of sci-fi and fantasy, Ursula Le Guin spoke a powerful philosophy,

01:56.000 --> 02:01.120
a philosophy that shows us how the art of words can resist and change the world,

02:01.840 --> 02:09.040
in which human imagination, our ideas and feelings, our dreams and visions, and the very stories we

02:09.040 --> 02:17.440
tell have the power to shape reality. It's a philosophy of immense power, the power to build

02:17.440 --> 02:27.040
worlds and the power to destroy them. Wait, wait, wait right there. We're talking about a

02:27.040 --> 02:33.200
kid's fantasy author, the lady who wrote those dragon books, right? Well, you might be confusing

02:33.200 --> 02:39.760
the subject of this essay with Anne McCaffrey, or Jane Yolen, or any of the intelligent sci-fi

02:39.760 --> 02:45.920
and fantasy writers who have created beautiful and politically relevant stories for children.

02:46.480 --> 02:52.880
If you mean to change the world, where better to start than the dreams of the young? Ursula

02:52.880 --> 02:58.640
Le Guin's career stretched over six decades, but the work she remains most famous for,

02:59.200 --> 03:05.680
and that we're going to be thinking about here, were created in a brief few years between 1968 and

03:05.680 --> 03:14.000
1974. Think of these as Le Guin's Bob Dylan years, when she created the tunes most of us still

03:14.000 --> 03:19.600
hum along to. That's not to reduce the rest of Le Guin's career, but here we're thinking about

03:19.600 --> 03:26.080
the core philosophy of Le Guin, her big ideas. You don't need to have read these books to follow

03:26.080 --> 03:31.440
this, and we won't be spoiling them. In fact, we're not going to be talking about most of what's

03:31.440 --> 03:37.440
special about these stories, not the quality of Le Guin's writing or her poetic imagery.

03:38.000 --> 03:45.600
We're just going to find the big ideas that are the philosophy of Ursula Le Guin. To do that,

03:45.600 --> 03:50.400
we're going to name check a number of famed philosophers. You don't need to know who Emmanuel

03:50.400 --> 03:57.120
Kant is, have read Hegel or any of the German idealists, but if you want to go deeper into

03:57.120 --> 04:03.840
philosophy, I recommend the channel of Professor Michael Sugru as an excellent guide. If things

04:03.840 --> 04:11.680
get a bit too abstract and confusing along the way, just hang on, we'll try to bring it all together

04:12.400 --> 04:20.560
at the end. Okay. The Left Hand of Darkness, published in 1969, The Lave of Heaven, 1971,

04:20.560 --> 04:29.600
and the dispossessed 1974, defined Le Guin as a science fiction author. In a unique achievement,

04:29.600 --> 04:36.960
Le Guin simultaneously wrote and published a fantasy trilogy. The Wizard of Earth, see 1968,

04:37.040 --> 04:46.720
The Tombs of Attuan, 1970, and the farthest shore, 1972. And for good measure, in 1973, Le Guin

04:46.720 --> 04:54.240
published The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas, one of the most famous science fiction stories ever

04:54.240 --> 05:01.120
published. What kind of music do you usually have here? Oh, we got both kinds. We got country and

05:01.600 --> 05:09.680
science fiction. Surely, Omelas is a fantasy story. Le Guin was one of many authors who saw

05:09.680 --> 05:16.800
science fiction and fantasy as flip sides of the same coin. All fiction is metaphor. Science

05:16.800 --> 05:22.320
fiction is metaphor. Le Guin argues in her introduction to the Left Hand of Darkness,

05:22.880 --> 05:30.000
but metaphor for what? Keep that question in mind on our journey. To understand Le Guin's writing

05:30.000 --> 05:36.000
and her philosophy, we need to place her in context as a woman writer working in the male

05:36.000 --> 05:42.800
dominated field of American science fiction of the late 1960s. The women on your planet are

05:42.800 --> 05:50.720
logical. That's the only planet in this galaxy that can make that claim. A machine does not care.

05:51.280 --> 05:59.280
Tom Godwin, The Cold Equations. The Cold Equations, 1954, is a science fiction story Ursula Le Guin

05:59.280 --> 06:06.400
would have read when she was a young writer and fan of Amazing Stories magazine. It tells of a young

06:06.400 --> 06:14.240
woman who stows away on a spacecraft, but the ship only has fuel for its mission. So the cold

06:14.240 --> 06:21.760
equations of reality dictates the girl must be blown out of the airlock. It's widely believed

06:21.760 --> 06:28.480
that while the story was offered by Tom Godwin, it's rather incredible ending the young woman

06:28.480 --> 06:35.760
willingly accepts her sacrifice was dictated by the legendary editor of Amazing Stories magazine,

06:36.400 --> 06:41.760
John W. Campbell. Campbell shaped the field of American science fiction, which grew up in the

06:41.760 --> 06:48.960
pulp magazines of the early 20th century around the idea of stories that extrapolated current

06:48.960 --> 06:56.800
science into the future. Campbell formalized the label science fiction to describe such stories.

06:57.600 --> 07:06.800
The Cold Equations exemplifies Cambalian sci-fi that sees reality as a set of cold hard facts

07:06.800 --> 07:14.880
sitting out in the void of space. Reality as a machine that does not care. And Cambalian sci-fi

07:14.880 --> 07:22.400
displayed a casual disregard for women whom it frequently caricatured as unreasoning creatures

07:22.400 --> 07:30.880
who put feelings before the cold hard equations of reality. Early science fiction was created by

07:30.880 --> 07:36.960
women writers like Margaret Cavendish and Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley. Hundreds of other women

07:36.960 --> 07:45.360
writers for the 18th and 19th centuries imagined a diverse array of utopian and feminist futures.

07:45.360 --> 07:51.760
You can learn more in my podcast episode about the true history of science fiction,

07:51.760 --> 07:58.400
but Cambalian science fiction largely wrote women out of the field. The history of science fiction

07:58.400 --> 08:05.920
was rewritten to start with Jules Verne and H.G. Wells, relative latecomers, and the definition

08:05.920 --> 08:14.080
of science fiction was narrowed to exclude those earlier feminist utopias and include only pure

08:14.080 --> 08:23.360
scientific speculation. The ones who walk away from Omelas 1973 can be read as a rejoinder to

08:23.360 --> 08:31.360
stories like the Cold Equations. Both are short stories that use a kind of reductio ad absurdum,

08:31.360 --> 08:39.520
pushing an argument that limits of logic to show where it breaks. The city of Omelas is a perfect

08:39.520 --> 08:49.040
utopia except for one child who is held prisoner to suffer for all. Most in Omelas accept this

08:49.040 --> 08:56.080
bargain, but the ones who walk away from Omelas exemplify a higher morality, rejecting injustice

08:56.080 --> 09:02.960
and accepting the unknown, perhaps even death instead. In her introduction to her debut novel

09:03.040 --> 09:06.720
The Left Hand of Darkness, written some years after its publication,

09:07.280 --> 09:14.800
Le Guin devastates the Cambalian idea of speculative sci-fi stating that it always arrives

09:14.800 --> 09:22.000
somewhere between the gradual extinction of human liberty and the total extinction of human life.

09:22.560 --> 09:28.080
If the Cold Equations argues that reality is a machine that does not care,

09:28.080 --> 09:35.200
Omelas replies, even so, the only moral path is to resist whatever the consequence is.

09:35.840 --> 09:42.000
And so the gauntlet was thrown down for a clash of philosophies between Cambalian sci-fi

09:42.720 --> 09:50.640
versus Ursula Le Guin. Cambalian sci-fi believed a better world could be made by science and

09:50.640 --> 09:56.800
technology. Any problem could be fixed by just building bigger and better machines,

09:56.800 --> 10:01.360
that the natural universe is made of matter, particles and forces,

10:01.920 --> 10:07.600
an uncaring machine governed by the cold equations of reality. We can call this the

10:07.600 --> 10:14.960
philosophy of materialism, realism or naturalism. Ursula Le Guin was a revolutionary force in

10:14.960 --> 10:20.880
science fiction because she championed an alternate philosophy, a philosophical school

10:20.880 --> 10:27.600
which argues that the human world is shaped by human thinking, that the universe and everything in

10:27.600 --> 10:36.560
it are the product of human mental formations, of human ideas, the philosophy of idealism.

10:36.560 --> 10:43.680
I think hard times are coming when we will be wanting the voices of writers who can see alternatives,

10:43.680 --> 10:52.240
can see through our fear-stricken society and its obsessive technologies to other ways of being.

10:52.880 --> 10:59.440
We will need writers who can remember freedom, the realists of a larger reality.

11:05.920 --> 11:10.560
The left hand of darkness explores one of the most controversial

11:10.560 --> 11:20.080
and politically charged issues of our time, gender. Genly I is a man on a mission to invite the

11:20.080 --> 11:27.840
planet of Geffen to join the Ecumen, a political alliance trying to re-establish galactic civilization.

11:28.400 --> 11:36.160
The people of Geffen have no fixed gender identities, which Genly is very slow to understand.

11:36.800 --> 11:42.720
He forms a deep relationship with a Geffen native, but is unable to overcome his gender

11:42.720 --> 11:50.720
perceptions to recognize that he's in love. Our entire pattern of socio-sexual interaction

11:50.720 --> 11:58.080
is non-existent here. They cannot play the game. They do not see one another as men or women.

11:58.080 --> 12:04.480
This is almost impossible for our imagination to accept. What is the first question we ask

12:04.480 --> 12:10.400
about a newborn baby? Ursula K. Le Guin, the left hand of darkness. Even when the left hand of

12:10.400 --> 12:17.760
darkness was written, women were still seen as the second sex. Evolution and biology materialist

12:17.760 --> 12:25.040
philosophy argued had made women smaller, weaker, even less intelligent. Their role was as second

12:25.040 --> 12:32.800
class citizens, if they were citizens at all. Those were the cold equations of gender, understood

12:32.800 --> 12:39.360
through the dominant materialist philosophy. That was reality. Feminist philosophers from

12:39.360 --> 12:48.560
Simone de Beauvoir to Judith Butler argued instead that gender was performative. Sex may be biologically

12:48.560 --> 12:55.360
determined, but contributed only a part to the performance of gender. In opposition to the

12:55.360 --> 13:03.280
dominant realist concept of gender was constructed an alternative idealist philosophy. Gender was

13:03.280 --> 13:11.680
a mental concept, an idea that could be changed or even abandoned. In the imagined world of Geffen,

13:12.400 --> 13:20.640
Le Guin is able to model gender performativity to see what remains behind after gender is removed.

13:21.200 --> 13:26.640
The left hand of darkness became a classic work of science fiction because it moved

13:26.640 --> 13:33.040
the idealist philosophy of gender performativity out of the realm of theory and into the powerful

13:33.040 --> 13:40.720
world of story. Ursula Le Guin completed seven novels in the heinous sequence, each exploring

13:40.720 --> 13:47.760
radical ideas that would influence science fiction authors who followed, including Ian M. Banks and

13:47.760 --> 13:55.280
Anne Leckie. The dispossessed is arguably the most radical of Le Guin's novels. A refugee

13:55.280 --> 14:01.840
scientist, the creator of Le Guin's famous Ansible, travels from the anarchist utopia of

14:01.840 --> 14:09.120
Anárez to the capitalist nation of Urás. Like any good utopia, since Thomas More defined the

14:09.120 --> 14:16.960
concept in his 1516 book of that title, the dispossessed imagines a world run under a single

14:16.960 --> 14:23.840
political ideology, anarchism in this case, and what the consequences might be. The outcome

14:23.840 --> 14:30.080
is equivocal, as Le Guin concedes in her book's subtitle, An Ambiguous Utopia.

14:30.080 --> 14:37.120
Anarchism is a political ideology built on idealist philosophy. It asserts that humans

14:37.120 --> 14:44.240
are not simply products of nature driven by greed and violence in a fight for survival. Instead,

14:44.320 --> 14:52.800
human ideas about humanity, like justice, fairness and peace, are fundamental to human existence.

14:52.800 --> 14:59.280
Anarchism has its roots with idealist philosophers like Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who believed in the

14:59.280 --> 15:06.480
essential goodness of humanity. Remove unjust social structures like kings and governments,

15:06.480 --> 15:14.720
Rousseau argued, and human goodness would flourish. Rousseau's ideas directly inspired both the

15:14.720 --> 15:23.040
French and American revolutions, fought in the name of ideas like liberty, freedom and equality.

15:23.040 --> 15:30.480
If Le Guin's anarchist utopia is ambiguous, it's because real world anarchies are too.

15:30.480 --> 15:36.080
The anarchy that followed the French Revolution cost thousands of lives to the guillotine,

15:36.080 --> 15:43.120
and the American Revolution produced not an anarchist utopia, but modern capitalism.

15:43.120 --> 15:48.880
But the idealist philosophy of the dispossessed goes even deeper than politics.

15:49.520 --> 15:58.480
Le Guin takes on one of the most fundamental arguments in philosophy, the concept of time itself.

15:58.480 --> 16:05.440
The refugee scientist Chevek is developing a new theory of time that will lead to the

16:05.440 --> 16:11.600
creation of the Ansible, Le Guin's famous invention for faster-than-light communication.

16:11.600 --> 16:17.360
But Chevek's theory arises not from a breakthrough discovery of quantum physics,

16:18.080 --> 16:27.040
but from an insight into the shape of time. Time has two aspects. There is the arrow,

16:27.040 --> 16:33.280
the running river, without which there is no change, no progress, or direction, or creation.

16:34.000 --> 16:40.960
And there is the circle, or the cycle, without which there is chaos, a meaningless progression

16:40.960 --> 16:49.040
of instance, a world without clocks, or seasons, or promises. A silicae Le Guin, the dispossessed.

16:49.040 --> 16:56.400
Le Guin's concept of time is mirrored in the great-granddaddy of idealist philosophy, Emmanuel

16:56.400 --> 17:04.480
Kant. Kant famously, and rather controversially classified, both time and space, not as things

17:04.480 --> 17:13.520
happening out there in the universe, but as categories of human perception. Space and time

17:13.520 --> 17:20.880
are the framework within which the mind is constrained to construct its experience of reality.

17:20.880 --> 17:28.000
Kant argued that humans could only ever perceive reality through the structures of our mind.

17:28.640 --> 17:35.680
The reality beyond these structures, the thing itself, could never be known. Space,

17:35.680 --> 17:43.280
time, objects, movement, relationship were not the true phenomena of reality, but the phenomena

17:43.840 --> 17:50.240
of the mind. Later idealist philosophers would ask the question, how are the structures of the

17:50.240 --> 17:58.160
mind formed? The answer that would revolutionize modern philosophy was language, that the structures

17:58.160 --> 18:06.560
of the mind and the reality we experience are shaped by the language we speak. Languages,

18:06.560 --> 18:14.160
as a power that can shape reality, are central to Ursula Le Guin's philosophy, not least her

18:14.160 --> 18:20.720
Earthsea novels. And to understand Earthsea, we need to look beyond the conscious mind

18:21.360 --> 18:31.440
and towards its dark shadow, the unconscious. The unconscious mind is co-extensive with the

18:31.440 --> 18:42.720
universe, Ursula Le Guin, the dispossessed. Earthsea is a fantasy land, an archipelago of

18:42.720 --> 18:50.720
islands where magic rules. Magic is practiced through language. In Earthsea, all things have

18:50.720 --> 18:58.240
a common name and a true name. Knowing the true name of a thing gives you power over that thing.

18:58.880 --> 19:07.120
Whether it's a cloud, a flower, a goat, or a dragon, the true name reveals the thing itself.

19:07.760 --> 19:13.280
The Wizard of Earthsea, 1968, reaches its inciting incident when the ambitious young

19:13.280 --> 19:20.560
wizard Ged accidentally succeeds in severing himself from his shadow. With this act, Ged,

19:20.560 --> 19:27.680
who had been a wild and powerful young wizard, becomes meek and uncertain. To regain his power,

19:27.680 --> 19:35.920
Ged will have to reintegrate his shadow. Ged had neither lost nor won, but naming the

19:35.920 --> 19:42.800
shadow of his death with his own name had made himself whole. A man who, knowing his whole,

19:42.800 --> 19:51.040
true self, cannot be used or possessed by any power other than himself. Ursula Le Guin, The

19:51.040 --> 19:56.800
Wizard of Earthsea. The shadow and the self are central images from the psychological theories

19:56.800 --> 20:03.920
of Carl Jung. In her essay, Myth and Archetype in Science Fiction, Ursula Le Guin talks about

20:03.920 --> 20:11.200
the place of Jungian symbolism in her storytelling. It's clear that the Earthsea novels are expressions

20:11.200 --> 20:18.400
of Carl Jung's theory of archetypes. The tombs of Atuan continues the Jungian fantasy.

20:18.400 --> 20:24.400
Tenar is a young woman who has been raised as the high priestess of an arcane faith.

20:25.200 --> 20:32.320
She is lost within a labyrinth and guided to freedom by Ged, who appears as the masculine ideal

20:32.320 --> 20:40.320
of Tenar's dreams. The archetype, the Carl Jung, labelled the anima. Carl Jung was a

20:40.320 --> 20:47.520
swish psychiatrist who began his career in the realist-materialist paradigm. With his mentor,

20:47.520 --> 20:55.520
Sigmund Freud, Jung was an early explorer of the concept of the unconscious, the idea that most of

20:55.760 --> 21:03.200
our thinking happens outside the awareness of the conscious mind. Study of the unconscious

21:03.200 --> 21:10.800
threw Carl Jung into the deep waters of idealist philosophy. Jung was ambivalent towards

21:10.800 --> 21:17.120
philosophers like Kant and Hegel. But the deeper he swam into the unconscious,

21:17.840 --> 21:25.040
the more unescapable idealism became. Jung left his scientific research and spent

21:25.120 --> 21:31.600
years in inner contemplation, producing his famous illuminated manuscript,

21:31.600 --> 21:40.000
the Liebernovus. Jung claims to have discovered structures of the unconscious mind, structures

21:40.000 --> 21:49.200
he called the archetypes of self, persona, shadow, anima, and more. Ursula Le Guin adopts

21:49.200 --> 21:57.520
these ideas of the unconscious and the Jungian archetypes to rewrite the narrative of fantasy.

21:57.520 --> 22:03.760
The war between the Dark Lord and the Good King of Tolkien's Middle Earth are replaced in Le Guin's

22:03.760 --> 22:13.040
Earthsea with the quest for self-knowledge. The evil we must defeat is not out there in the world,

22:13.040 --> 22:21.040
Le Guin tells her young readers, but inside our own selves. The farthest shore, the third volume

22:21.040 --> 22:28.880
of Earthsea, introduces the darkest and most complex of the Jungian archetypes, the Demiurge,

22:28.880 --> 22:35.680
or false god. Magic has left the land of Earthsea and Ged, now an older man, must sail

22:35.680 --> 22:41.840
out to find the cause. The farthest shore is a haunting and challenging story. Ged is now the

22:41.840 --> 22:47.520
mentor to a young prince, Aaron, who will complete his own hero's journey through the story.

22:48.240 --> 22:55.840
As they travel, Aaron is tormented by doubts about his mentor, sometimes Ged appears as the

22:55.840 --> 23:03.920
archmage of Roke, at other times he's just an ignorant old man. Earthsea has fallen under the

23:03.920 --> 23:11.920
magic of a dark wizard named Cobb. Cobb needs no armies of orcs, he is not conquering the world.

23:11.920 --> 23:21.280
The power of magic is to rewrite reality itself. The conflict between Ged and Cobb is about who

23:21.280 --> 23:27.680
controls reality. The Demiurge is an archetype that dates back to at least early Christianity.

23:28.240 --> 23:35.920
The Gnostic sect believes the Old Testament Jehovah to be a false god named Yal Leboeth.

23:36.800 --> 23:43.280
Carl Jung described his own encounter with the Demiurge, named Abraxas in his Libanovus.

23:43.920 --> 23:51.840
In the farthest shore, Ursula Le Guin has encountered her own Demiurge. The ending of the story is

23:51.840 --> 23:59.120
opaque and symbolically dense. It reads as though the author is struggling to navigate

23:59.120 --> 24:06.480
the inner world she is exploring. Le Guin is a young writer in her 40s who is unpacking these

24:06.480 --> 24:14.160
ideas as she goes. After the furthest shore and those six years of intense creativity,

24:14.160 --> 24:20.880
Ursula Le Guin's writing slows substantially. She doesn't return to Earthsea for 18 years,

24:20.880 --> 24:27.600
perhaps she is searching for answers to the questions raised by her philosophical questing

24:28.240 --> 24:34.720
and her encounter with the Demiurge and the dangers that encounter revealed.

24:35.840 --> 24:43.760
To begin to pull all these ideas together and before we dive into a final Le Guin story,

24:44.560 --> 24:52.800
let's think more about philosophy. Philosophy means love of wisdom. From the Greek philo,

24:53.360 --> 25:02.480
a form of love and Sophia, the goddess of wisdom. Only a fool would think that a philosophy without

25:02.480 --> 25:12.000
women would be wise. But as is widely noted, the canon of philosophy features almost no women.

25:12.000 --> 25:19.440
The storyteller and philosopher Clarissa Pincola Estes suggests that women have instead

25:19.440 --> 25:27.920
passed their wisdom down through stories. It's increasingly recognised that many of the greatest

25:27.920 --> 25:36.000
mythic stories passed down through history were perhaps offered by women. The anonymous J

25:36.000 --> 25:44.160
author of the Genesis Myths was a Babylonian princess. God may not be a woman, but his script

25:44.160 --> 25:52.000
writer was. Analysis of the Odyssey suggests Homer was a woman writer satirising the toxic

25:52.000 --> 25:58.880
masculinity of the classical era. European folklore is stamped with the names of Hans Christian Anderson

25:58.880 --> 26:06.000
and the Brothers Grimm, but these were stories told by women for women, about women.

26:07.440 --> 26:14.800
Add in those women writers who created science fiction, their names scrubbed from its history,

26:15.520 --> 26:23.360
and we have a pattern forming. To give Ursula Le Guin her full due, we must think of her in

26:23.440 --> 26:30.720
that tradition of great women storytellers, philosopher poets who express their wisdom

26:30.720 --> 26:39.120
in stories. That Le Guin stories are not only great science fiction, but mythic stories that

26:39.120 --> 26:46.880
express a deep and powerful philosophy. And as she explored the power of this philosophy,

26:46.880 --> 26:54.320
Ursula Le Guin also considered the dangers that came with such power in the archetypal figure

26:54.880 --> 27:04.320
of the demiurge. Ursula Le Guin titled The Lave of Heaven after a mistranslation

27:04.320 --> 27:12.160
from the Taoist poet Zhuangzi. That mistake aside, the title poetically captures the essence

27:12.160 --> 27:20.400
of Le Guin's philosophy. George Orr, a likely nod to Orwell in 1984, is an ordinary man who

27:20.400 --> 27:29.120
believes his dreams can change reality. But instead of using this power for himself, Orr is exploited

27:29.120 --> 27:36.880
by the psychologist William Harbour, a man of stronger will. Harbour's various attempts to

27:36.880 --> 27:44.480
shape Orr's dreams to make a better world all result in a worse world, but make Harbour ever

27:44.480 --> 27:52.480
more powerful. The strength of Harbour's will allows him to control reality until Orr fights back.

27:53.200 --> 27:59.840
The conflict between Orr and Harbour in The Lave of Heaven mirrors the conflict between Ged

27:59.840 --> 28:06.560
and Cobb in The Father's Shore. Both are encounters with the demiurge archetype,

28:06.560 --> 28:13.360
conflicts over the most fundamental question. If human willpower can reshape reality,

28:14.000 --> 28:21.600
the question becomes who's will? It's kind of like old fairy tales where somebody's trying to do good

28:21.600 --> 28:27.040
and is always sort of defeated by reality. You've got to go with the flow. You can't push the river,

28:27.040 --> 28:33.600
as the Buddhists say. And Poor Harbour in the book is a do-gooder, but George is sort of in tune

28:33.600 --> 28:40.240
with things. Go with the flow man. Go with the flow man. And of course, this is a Taoist book.

28:41.280 --> 28:46.640
The Taoism was pretty conscious. What do you mean by that? A lot of people say,

28:46.640 --> 28:52.960
what does she mean, a Taoist book? Well, in the Buddhist sense, the Taoism says you do things

28:52.960 --> 28:59.760
by not doing things. And all attempt to do and to set things right and to make things happen

29:01.840 --> 29:09.920
eventually backfires. The Lave of Heaven is Le Guin's Taoist novel. Le Guin had a lifelong

29:09.920 --> 29:15.920
interest in the Eastern philosophy of Taoism. In contrast to the Confucian tradition that

29:15.920 --> 29:22.800
emphasises rigid social order, Taoism is a philosophy of change and flexibility that

29:22.800 --> 29:30.080
emphasises the need to flow with the forces that surround us. The Lave of Heaven, with its failed

29:30.080 --> 29:38.560
experiments in reshaping human social order, is Le Guin's most complex thought experiment on the

29:38.560 --> 29:46.720
question of, is a better world possible? And what if the New World turns out not to be better

29:46.720 --> 29:54.720
at all? It's a book that asks hard questions about the utopian vision of a better world.

29:54.720 --> 30:02.320
Utopianism was given a new energy by the philosophy of George Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel.

30:03.040 --> 30:10.400
Hegel built on the idealism of Kant to argue that the structures of the human mind didn't just

30:10.400 --> 30:18.720
shape our perception of reality, but the history and development of human civilisation. History,

30:18.720 --> 30:27.200
Hegel argued, had a shape. And by understanding that shape, we could progress to the end of history,

30:27.840 --> 30:35.840
where a better world was possible. Hegel's ideas influenced both liberal and socialist

30:35.840 --> 30:43.360
utopian dreams. But the most famous thinker to be inspired by the Hegelian model of history was

30:44.000 --> 30:52.080
Karl Marx, father of Marxism. Marx's ideas for a communist utopia at the end of history were

30:52.080 --> 30:57.360
so convincing to people who dreamed of a better world that communist revolutions

30:57.360 --> 31:06.080
spread worldwide in the 20th century. But time and again, these utopian revolutions served

31:06.080 --> 31:13.200
not the workers, but a new intellectual elite who had the intelligence and strength of will

31:13.200 --> 31:20.080
to lead such revolutions. Like George Orr, the workers of the world discovered they did have

31:20.080 --> 31:27.200
the power to make a better world, but that power was taken from them by men of stronger will,

31:27.200 --> 31:37.040
like William Haber, or Joseph Stalin, or Mao Zedong, or Adolf Hitler, or Fidel Castro,

31:37.040 --> 31:43.120
the Cuban dictator who famously declared a better world is possible.

31:43.840 --> 31:50.640
All fiction is metaphor. Science fiction is metaphor.

31:53.360 --> 32:02.480
The lave of heaven is metaphor for the human will to power. No lone man can reshape reality with his

32:02.480 --> 32:10.720
dreams, but the human collective has it within our power to create almost any reality we can dream

32:10.720 --> 32:19.520
or imagine. But whose dreams? Whose imagination will be made real? Whose will has the power?

32:20.320 --> 32:26.320
Science fiction in its golden age, under John W. Campbell, created metaphors for the philosophy

32:26.320 --> 32:32.000
of realism and naturalism. It expressed the dreams of rational men who believed the world

32:32.000 --> 32:38.800
could be made better with science and technology. But as those dreams became real, as the space

32:38.800 --> 32:45.520
rockets, nuclear weapons, and artificial intelligence of sci-fi dreams came into reality,

32:46.400 --> 32:54.560
they failed to make a better world. Technology is just a tool in the hands of humans driven by human

32:54.560 --> 33:03.360
ideas. Ursula Le Guin was not alone in challenging Campbellian science fiction. Other authors of

33:03.360 --> 33:10.560
the new wave, like Samuel Delaney and J. G. Ballard, joined her. But Le Guin's stories have

33:10.560 --> 33:16.560
proved the most long-lasting because they are the most powerful metaphors for the philosophy

33:16.560 --> 33:23.920
that challenges materialism, the philosophy of idealism. To make a better world, Le Guin argues,

33:23.920 --> 33:31.440
we need to understand the inner world of imagination and dreams that shape the outer world.

33:31.440 --> 33:37.200
In this essay, we've looked at some of the philosophical ideas that Ursula Le Guin's stories

33:37.200 --> 33:43.920
echo. I'm not suggesting Ursula Le Guin set out to create metaphors for Kantian idealism,

33:44.480 --> 33:50.800
but rather that Le Guin, as a great thinker and creator, was discovering for herself new ways

33:50.800 --> 33:59.440
of conceptualizing reality. And by expressing those ideas in stories, Le Guin became one of,

34:00.080 --> 34:07.280
or perhaps the greatest, philosopher poets of our time. If we were to give Ursula Le Guin's

34:07.280 --> 34:16.240
philosophy a name, we might call it radical idealism. Radical in three senses. Firstly,

34:16.240 --> 34:22.480
that it models a pure idealism, in which language, archetypes of the unconscious,

34:22.480 --> 34:30.960
and the conceptual structures of mind create our reality. Secondly, that there is a power

34:30.960 --> 34:38.960
in knowing the true names at the root of reality, and that fundamental concepts like gender and

34:38.960 --> 34:48.000
identity can be controlled and changed. Thirdly, that control over the root concepts of reality

34:48.080 --> 34:56.400
should serve radical social change. The danger of Ursula Le Guin's philosophy of radical idealism

34:56.400 --> 35:04.720
is twofold. Firstly, there is the haunting question of whose reality. As we awaken to the

35:04.720 --> 35:13.360
potential of the human collective will to reshape our reality in the image of our dreams and stories,

35:13.920 --> 35:22.160
we need to beware that our dreams do not become nightmares, and that the story we tell is a good

35:22.160 --> 35:30.000
one. There is the constant threat that those who win the fight for reality are those with the strongest

35:30.000 --> 35:38.880
will, but the least wisdom, the demi urges of our time. The second danger is less obvious,

35:38.960 --> 35:45.760
but more immediate. If we accept the idealist model that the mind and imagination can,

35:46.320 --> 35:52.960
in some sense, shape reality, then it's clear that we aren't the first to realise this.

35:53.680 --> 36:00.160
Those with real power have always known it. Caesars and kings, politicians and popes,

36:00.720 --> 36:09.120
billionaires and media magnates all know that part of their power rests on controlling the

36:09.120 --> 36:17.840
narrative, shaping the ideas and concepts that in turn shape our reality. The power of Ursula

36:17.840 --> 36:26.080
Le Guin's storytelling is that it reaches into our dreams and imagination. It weaves meaning

36:26.080 --> 36:35.280
from symbol, metaphor and archetype. It crafts mythic stories to awaken all who read it to the

36:35.280 --> 36:43.840
deep truths of our reality, truths that are no longer hidden and secret, but are now being learned

36:44.480 --> 36:51.520
by all. Ursula Le Guin's philosophy is dangerous because it awakens the once powerless

36:52.080 --> 37:01.520
to the potential of our own power. Those who cling to unjust power over others might find that

37:02.080 --> 37:09.280
very dangerous indeed. Listen to the long-form audio commentary on the dangerous philosophy of
