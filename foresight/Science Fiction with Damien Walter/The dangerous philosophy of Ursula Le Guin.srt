1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,040
We live in capitalism. Its power seems inescapable. So did the divine right of kings. Any human power

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:17,760
can be resisted and changed by human beings. Resistance and change often begin in art,

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,880
very often in our art, the art of the words.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,840
Ursula Croba Le Guin was among the most acclaimed and respected science fiction writers

5
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:36,400
of the 20th century, a best-selling author in 40 languages, multiple winner of the Hugo and Nebula

6
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:44,400
Awards, and inspiration to generations who have followed her. Here in the 21st century Le Guin

7
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:53,040
has become something more than a beloved author. She has become an icon. She may be the only classic

8
00:00:53,040 --> 00:01:01,680
sci-fi writer to regularly trend on TikTok. Ursula Le Guin is one of my favorite authors.

9
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:08,560
Science fiction is the art that builds worlds. In her science fiction stories, Ursula Le Guin didn't

10
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,960
just tell us a better world was possible, she showed us better worlds by building them in the

11
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:21,680
imagination of generations, worlds where life is fairer, more equal, and more just.

12
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:28,960
At this point in time, when a better world seems to be slipping through our fingers,

13
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:35,040
I want to understand the better worlds that Ursula Le Guin showed us. I want to dig down

14
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:43,360
to the big ideas that shaped Le Guin's storytelling. I want to understand not just Ursula Le Guin,

15
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,920
the sci-fi writer, but Ursula Le Guin, the philosopher.

16
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:56,000
Through the medium of sci-fi and fantasy, Ursula Le Guin spoke a powerful philosophy,

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,120
a philosophy that shows us how the art of words can resist and change the world,

18
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:09,040
in which human imagination, our ideas and feelings, our dreams and visions, and the very stories we

19
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:17,440
tell have the power to shape reality. It's a philosophy of immense power, the power to build

20
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:27,040
worlds and the power to destroy them. Wait, wait, wait right there. We're talking about a

21
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:33,200
kid's fantasy author, the lady who wrote those dragon books, right? Well, you might be confusing

22
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:39,760
the subject of this essay with Anne McCaffrey, or Jane Yolen, or any of the intelligent sci-fi

23
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,920
and fantasy writers who have created beautiful and politically relevant stories for children.

24
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:52,880
If you mean to change the world, where better to start than the dreams of the young? Ursula

25
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:58,640
Le Guin's career stretched over six decades, but the work she remains most famous for,

26
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:05,680
and that we're going to be thinking about here, were created in a brief few years between 1968 and

27
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:14,000
1974. Think of these as Le Guin's Bob Dylan years, when she created the tunes most of us still

28
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,600
hum along to. That's not to reduce the rest of Le Guin's career, but here we're thinking about

29
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:26,080
the core philosophy of Le Guin, her big ideas. You don't need to have read these books to follow

30
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,440
this, and we won't be spoiling them. In fact, we're not going to be talking about most of what's

31
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:37,440
special about these stories, not the quality of Le Guin's writing or her poetic imagery.

32
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:45,600
We're just going to find the big ideas that are the philosophy of Ursula Le Guin. To do that,

33
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:50,400
we're going to name check a number of famed philosophers. You don't need to know who Emmanuel

34
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:57,120
Kant is, have read Hegel or any of the German idealists, but if you want to go deeper into

35
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:03,840
philosophy, I recommend the channel of Professor Michael Sugru as an excellent guide. If things

36
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:11,680
get a bit too abstract and confusing along the way, just hang on, we'll try to bring it all together

37
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:20,560
at the end. Okay. The Left Hand of Darkness, published in 1969, The Lave of Heaven, 1971,

38
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:29,600
and the dispossessed 1974, defined Le Guin as a science fiction author. In a unique achievement,

39
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:36,960
Le Guin simultaneously wrote and published a fantasy trilogy. The Wizard of Earth, see 1968,

40
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:46,720
The Tombs of Attuan, 1970, and the farthest shore, 1972. And for good measure, in 1973, Le Guin

41
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:54,240
published The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas, one of the most famous science fiction stories ever

42
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:01,120
published. What kind of music do you usually have here? Oh, we got both kinds. We got country and

43
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:09,680
science fiction. Surely, Omelas is a fantasy story. Le Guin was one of many authors who saw

44
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:16,800
science fiction and fantasy as flip sides of the same coin. All fiction is metaphor. Science

45
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,320
fiction is metaphor. Le Guin argues in her introduction to the Left Hand of Darkness,

46
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:30,000
but metaphor for what? Keep that question in mind on our journey. To understand Le Guin's writing

47
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
and her philosophy, we need to place her in context as a woman writer working in the male

48
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,800
dominated field of American science fiction of the late 1960s. The women on your planet are

49
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:50,720
logical. That's the only planet in this galaxy that can make that claim. A machine does not care.

50
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:59,280
Tom Godwin, The Cold Equations. The Cold Equations, 1954, is a science fiction story Ursula Le Guin

51
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:06,400
would have read when she was a young writer and fan of Amazing Stories magazine. It tells of a young

52
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:14,240
woman who stows away on a spacecraft, but the ship only has fuel for its mission. So the cold

53
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:21,760
equations of reality dictates the girl must be blown out of the airlock. It's widely believed

54
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:28,480
that while the story was offered by Tom Godwin, it's rather incredible ending the young woman

55
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:35,760
willingly accepts her sacrifice was dictated by the legendary editor of Amazing Stories magazine,

56
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,760
John W. Campbell. Campbell shaped the field of American science fiction, which grew up in the

57
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:48,960
pulp magazines of the early 20th century around the idea of stories that extrapolated current

58
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:56,800
science into the future. Campbell formalized the label science fiction to describe such stories.

59
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:06,800
The Cold Equations exemplifies Cambalian sci-fi that sees reality as a set of cold hard facts

60
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:14,880
sitting out in the void of space. Reality as a machine that does not care. And Cambalian sci-fi

61
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:22,400
displayed a casual disregard for women whom it frequently caricatured as unreasoning creatures

62
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:30,880
who put feelings before the cold hard equations of reality. Early science fiction was created by

63
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:36,960
women writers like Margaret Cavendish and Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley. Hundreds of other women

64
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:45,360
writers for the 18th and 19th centuries imagined a diverse array of utopian and feminist futures.

65
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:51,760
You can learn more in my podcast episode about the true history of science fiction,

66
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:58,400
but Cambalian science fiction largely wrote women out of the field. The history of science fiction

67
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:05,920
was rewritten to start with Jules Verne and H.G. Wells, relative latecomers, and the definition

68
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:14,080
of science fiction was narrowed to exclude those earlier feminist utopias and include only pure

69
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:23,360
scientific speculation. The ones who walk away from Omelas 1973 can be read as a rejoinder to

70
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:31,360
stories like the Cold Equations. Both are short stories that use a kind of reductio ad absurdum,

71
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:39,520
pushing an argument that limits of logic to show where it breaks. The city of Omelas is a perfect

72
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:49,040
utopia except for one child who is held prisoner to suffer for all. Most in Omelas accept this

73
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:56,080
bargain, but the ones who walk away from Omelas exemplify a higher morality, rejecting injustice

74
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:02,960
and accepting the unknown, perhaps even death instead. In her introduction to her debut novel

75
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,720
The Left Hand of Darkness, written some years after its publication,

76
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:14,800
Le Guin devastates the Cambalian idea of speculative sci-fi stating that it always arrives

77
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:22,000
somewhere between the gradual extinction of human liberty and the total extinction of human life.

78
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:28,080
If the Cold Equations argues that reality is a machine that does not care,

79
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:35,200
Omelas replies, even so, the only moral path is to resist whatever the consequence is.

80
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:42,000
And so the gauntlet was thrown down for a clash of philosophies between Cambalian sci-fi

81
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:50,640
versus Ursula Le Guin. Cambalian sci-fi believed a better world could be made by science and

82
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:56,800
technology. Any problem could be fixed by just building bigger and better machines,

83
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,360
that the natural universe is made of matter, particles and forces,

84
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:07,600
an uncaring machine governed by the cold equations of reality. We can call this the

85
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:14,960
philosophy of materialism, realism or naturalism. Ursula Le Guin was a revolutionary force in

86
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:20,880
science fiction because she championed an alternate philosophy, a philosophical school

87
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:27,600
which argues that the human world is shaped by human thinking, that the universe and everything in

88
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:36,560
it are the product of human mental formations, of human ideas, the philosophy of idealism.

89
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:43,680
I think hard times are coming when we will be wanting the voices of writers who can see alternatives,

90
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:52,240
can see through our fear-stricken society and its obsessive technologies to other ways of being.

91
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:59,440
We will need writers who can remember freedom, the realists of a larger reality.

92
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,560
The left hand of darkness explores one of the most controversial

93
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:20,080
and politically charged issues of our time, gender. Genly I is a man on a mission to invite the

94
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:27,840
planet of Geffen to join the Ecumen, a political alliance trying to re-establish galactic civilization.

95
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:36,160
The people of Geffen have no fixed gender identities, which Genly is very slow to understand.

96
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,720
He forms a deep relationship with a Geffen native, but is unable to overcome his gender

97
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:50,720
perceptions to recognize that he's in love. Our entire pattern of socio-sexual interaction

98
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:58,080
is non-existent here. They cannot play the game. They do not see one another as men or women.

99
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:04,480
This is almost impossible for our imagination to accept. What is the first question we ask

100
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:10,400
about a newborn baby? Ursula K. Le Guin, the left hand of darkness. Even when the left hand of

101
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:17,760
darkness was written, women were still seen as the second sex. Evolution and biology materialist

102
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:25,040
philosophy argued had made women smaller, weaker, even less intelligent. Their role was as second

103
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:32,800
class citizens, if they were citizens at all. Those were the cold equations of gender, understood

104
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:39,360
through the dominant materialist philosophy. That was reality. Feminist philosophers from

105
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:48,560
Simone de Beauvoir to Judith Butler argued instead that gender was performative. Sex may be biologically

106
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:55,360
determined, but contributed only a part to the performance of gender. In opposition to the

107
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:03,280
dominant realist concept of gender was constructed an alternative idealist philosophy. Gender was

108
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:11,680
a mental concept, an idea that could be changed or even abandoned. In the imagined world of Geffen,

109
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:20,640
Le Guin is able to model gender performativity to see what remains behind after gender is removed.

110
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,640
The left hand of darkness became a classic work of science fiction because it moved

111
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:33,040
the idealist philosophy of gender performativity out of the realm of theory and into the powerful

112
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:40,720
world of story. Ursula Le Guin completed seven novels in the heinous sequence, each exploring

113
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:47,760
radical ideas that would influence science fiction authors who followed, including Ian M. Banks and

114
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:55,280
Anne Leckie. The dispossessed is arguably the most radical of Le Guin's novels. A refugee

115
00:13:55,280 --> 00:14:01,840
scientist, the creator of Le Guin's famous Ansible, travels from the anarchist utopia of

116
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:09,120
Anárez to the capitalist nation of Urás. Like any good utopia, since Thomas More defined the

117
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:16,960
concept in his 1516 book of that title, the dispossessed imagines a world run under a single

118
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:23,840
political ideology, anarchism in this case, and what the consequences might be. The outcome

119
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:30,080
is equivocal, as Le Guin concedes in her book's subtitle, An Ambiguous Utopia.

120
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:37,120
Anarchism is a political ideology built on idealist philosophy. It asserts that humans

121
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:44,240
are not simply products of nature driven by greed and violence in a fight for survival. Instead,

122
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:52,800
human ideas about humanity, like justice, fairness and peace, are fundamental to human existence.

123
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:59,280
Anarchism has its roots with idealist philosophers like Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who believed in the

124
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:06,480
essential goodness of humanity. Remove unjust social structures like kings and governments,

125
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:14,720
Rousseau argued, and human goodness would flourish. Rousseau's ideas directly inspired both the

126
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:23,040
French and American revolutions, fought in the name of ideas like liberty, freedom and equality.

127
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:30,480
If Le Guin's anarchist utopia is ambiguous, it's because real world anarchies are too.

128
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:36,080
The anarchy that followed the French Revolution cost thousands of lives to the guillotine,

129
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:43,120
and the American Revolution produced not an anarchist utopia, but modern capitalism.

130
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:48,880
But the idealist philosophy of the dispossessed goes even deeper than politics.

131
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:58,480
Le Guin takes on one of the most fundamental arguments in philosophy, the concept of time itself.

132
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:05,440
The refugee scientist Chevek is developing a new theory of time that will lead to the

133
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:11,600
creation of the Ansible, Le Guin's famous invention for faster-than-light communication.

134
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:17,360
But Chevek's theory arises not from a breakthrough discovery of quantum physics,

135
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:27,040
but from an insight into the shape of time. Time has two aspects. There is the arrow,

136
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:33,280
the running river, without which there is no change, no progress, or direction, or creation.

137
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:40,960
And there is the circle, or the cycle, without which there is chaos, a meaningless progression

138
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:49,040
of instance, a world without clocks, or seasons, or promises. A silicae Le Guin, the dispossessed.

139
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:56,400
Le Guin's concept of time is mirrored in the great-granddaddy of idealist philosophy, Emmanuel

140
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:04,480
Kant. Kant famously, and rather controversially classified, both time and space, not as things

141
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:13,520
happening out there in the universe, but as categories of human perception. Space and time

142
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:20,880
are the framework within which the mind is constrained to construct its experience of reality.

143
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:28,000
Kant argued that humans could only ever perceive reality through the structures of our mind.

144
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:35,680
The reality beyond these structures, the thing itself, could never be known. Space,

145
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:43,280
time, objects, movement, relationship were not the true phenomena of reality, but the phenomena

146
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:50,240
of the mind. Later idealist philosophers would ask the question, how are the structures of the

147
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:58,160
mind formed? The answer that would revolutionize modern philosophy was language, that the structures

148
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:06,560
of the mind and the reality we experience are shaped by the language we speak. Languages,

149
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:14,160
as a power that can shape reality, are central to Ursula Le Guin's philosophy, not least her

150
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:20,720
Earthsea novels. And to understand Earthsea, we need to look beyond the conscious mind

151
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:31,440
and towards its dark shadow, the unconscious. The unconscious mind is co-extensive with the

152
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:42,720
universe, Ursula Le Guin, the dispossessed. Earthsea is a fantasy land, an archipelago of

153
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:50,720
islands where magic rules. Magic is practiced through language. In Earthsea, all things have

154
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:58,240
a common name and a true name. Knowing the true name of a thing gives you power over that thing.

155
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:07,120
Whether it's a cloud, a flower, a goat, or a dragon, the true name reveals the thing itself.

156
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:13,280
The Wizard of Earthsea, 1968, reaches its inciting incident when the ambitious young

157
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:20,560
wizard Ged accidentally succeeds in severing himself from his shadow. With this act, Ged,

158
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:27,680
who had been a wild and powerful young wizard, becomes meek and uncertain. To regain his power,

159
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:35,920
Ged will have to reintegrate his shadow. Ged had neither lost nor won, but naming the

160
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:42,800
shadow of his death with his own name had made himself whole. A man who, knowing his whole,

161
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:51,040
true self, cannot be used or possessed by any power other than himself. Ursula Le Guin, The

162
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:56,800
Wizard of Earthsea. The shadow and the self are central images from the psychological theories

163
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:03,920
of Carl Jung. In her essay, Myth and Archetype in Science Fiction, Ursula Le Guin talks about

164
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:11,200
the place of Jungian symbolism in her storytelling. It's clear that the Earthsea novels are expressions

165
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:18,400
of Carl Jung's theory of archetypes. The tombs of Atuan continues the Jungian fantasy.

166
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:24,400
Tenar is a young woman who has been raised as the high priestess of an arcane faith.

167
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:32,320
She is lost within a labyrinth and guided to freedom by Ged, who appears as the masculine ideal

168
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:40,320
of Tenar's dreams. The archetype, the Carl Jung, labelled the anima. Carl Jung was a

169
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:47,520
swish psychiatrist who began his career in the realist-materialist paradigm. With his mentor,

170
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:55,520
Sigmund Freud, Jung was an early explorer of the concept of the unconscious, the idea that most of

171
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:03,200
our thinking happens outside the awareness of the conscious mind. Study of the unconscious

172
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:10,800
threw Carl Jung into the deep waters of idealist philosophy. Jung was ambivalent towards

173
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:17,120
philosophers like Kant and Hegel. But the deeper he swam into the unconscious,

174
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:25,040
the more unescapable idealism became. Jung left his scientific research and spent

175
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:31,600
years in inner contemplation, producing his famous illuminated manuscript,

176
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:40,000
the Liebernovus. Jung claims to have discovered structures of the unconscious mind, structures

177
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:49,200
he called the archetypes of self, persona, shadow, anima, and more. Ursula Le Guin adopts

178
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:57,520
these ideas of the unconscious and the Jungian archetypes to rewrite the narrative of fantasy.

179
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:03,760
The war between the Dark Lord and the Good King of Tolkien's Middle Earth are replaced in Le Guin's

180
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:13,040
Earthsea with the quest for self-knowledge. The evil we must defeat is not out there in the world,

181
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:21,040
Le Guin tells her young readers, but inside our own selves. The farthest shore, the third volume

182
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:28,880
of Earthsea, introduces the darkest and most complex of the Jungian archetypes, the Demiurge,

183
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:35,680
or false god. Magic has left the land of Earthsea and Ged, now an older man, must sail

184
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:41,840
out to find the cause. The farthest shore is a haunting and challenging story. Ged is now the

185
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:47,520
mentor to a young prince, Aaron, who will complete his own hero's journey through the story.

186
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:55,840
As they travel, Aaron is tormented by doubts about his mentor, sometimes Ged appears as the

187
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:03,920
archmage of Roke, at other times he's just an ignorant old man. Earthsea has fallen under the

188
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:11,920
magic of a dark wizard named Cobb. Cobb needs no armies of orcs, he is not conquering the world.

189
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:21,280
The power of magic is to rewrite reality itself. The conflict between Ged and Cobb is about who

190
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:27,680
controls reality. The Demiurge is an archetype that dates back to at least early Christianity.

191
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:35,920
The Gnostic sect believes the Old Testament Jehovah to be a false god named Yal Leboeth.

192
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:43,280
Carl Jung described his own encounter with the Demiurge, named Abraxas in his Libanovus.

193
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:51,840
In the farthest shore, Ursula Le Guin has encountered her own Demiurge. The ending of the story is

194
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:59,120
opaque and symbolically dense. It reads as though the author is struggling to navigate

195
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:06,480
the inner world she is exploring. Le Guin is a young writer in her 40s who is unpacking these

196
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:14,160
ideas as she goes. After the furthest shore and those six years of intense creativity,

197
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:20,880
Ursula Le Guin's writing slows substantially. She doesn't return to Earthsea for 18 years,

198
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:27,600
perhaps she is searching for answers to the questions raised by her philosophical questing

199
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:34,720
and her encounter with the Demiurge and the dangers that encounter revealed.

200
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:43,760
To begin to pull all these ideas together and before we dive into a final Le Guin story,

201
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:52,800
let's think more about philosophy. Philosophy means love of wisdom. From the Greek philo,

202
00:24:53,360 --> 00:25:02,480
a form of love and Sophia, the goddess of wisdom. Only a fool would think that a philosophy without

203
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:12,000
women would be wise. But as is widely noted, the canon of philosophy features almost no women.

204
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:19,440
The storyteller and philosopher Clarissa Pincola Estes suggests that women have instead

205
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:27,920
passed their wisdom down through stories. It's increasingly recognised that many of the greatest

206
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:36,000
mythic stories passed down through history were perhaps offered by women. The anonymous J

207
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:44,160
author of the Genesis Myths was a Babylonian princess. God may not be a woman, but his script

208
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:52,000
writer was. Analysis of the Odyssey suggests Homer was a woman writer satirising the toxic

209
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:58,880
masculinity of the classical era. European folklore is stamped with the names of Hans Christian Anderson

210
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:06,000
and the Brothers Grimm, but these were stories told by women for women, about women.

211
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:14,800
Add in those women writers who created science fiction, their names scrubbed from its history,

212
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:23,360
and we have a pattern forming. To give Ursula Le Guin her full due, we must think of her in

213
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:30,720
that tradition of great women storytellers, philosopher poets who express their wisdom

214
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:39,120
in stories. That Le Guin stories are not only great science fiction, but mythic stories that

215
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:46,880
express a deep and powerful philosophy. And as she explored the power of this philosophy,

216
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:54,320
Ursula Le Guin also considered the dangers that came with such power in the archetypal figure

217
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:04,320
of the demiurge. Ursula Le Guin titled The Lave of Heaven after a mistranslation

218
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:12,160
from the Taoist poet Zhuangzi. That mistake aside, the title poetically captures the essence

219
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:20,400
of Le Guin's philosophy. George Orr, a likely nod to Orwell in 1984, is an ordinary man who

220
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:29,120
believes his dreams can change reality. But instead of using this power for himself, Orr is exploited

221
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:36,880
by the psychologist William Harbour, a man of stronger will. Harbour's various attempts to

222
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:44,480
shape Orr's dreams to make a better world all result in a worse world, but make Harbour ever

223
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:52,480
more powerful. The strength of Harbour's will allows him to control reality until Orr fights back.

224
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:59,840
The conflict between Orr and Harbour in The Lave of Heaven mirrors the conflict between Ged

225
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:06,560
and Cobb in The Father's Shore. Both are encounters with the demiurge archetype,

226
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:13,360
conflicts over the most fundamental question. If human willpower can reshape reality,

227
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:21,600
the question becomes who's will? It's kind of like old fairy tales where somebody's trying to do good

228
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:27,040
and is always sort of defeated by reality. You've got to go with the flow. You can't push the river,

229
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:33,600
as the Buddhists say. And Poor Harbour in the book is a do-gooder, but George is sort of in tune

230
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:40,240
with things. Go with the flow man. Go with the flow man. And of course, this is a Taoist book.

231
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:46,640
The Taoism was pretty conscious. What do you mean by that? A lot of people say,

232
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:52,960
what does she mean, a Taoist book? Well, in the Buddhist sense, the Taoism says you do things

233
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:59,760
by not doing things. And all attempt to do and to set things right and to make things happen

234
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:09,920
eventually backfires. The Lave of Heaven is Le Guin's Taoist novel. Le Guin had a lifelong

235
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:15,920
interest in the Eastern philosophy of Taoism. In contrast to the Confucian tradition that

236
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:22,800
emphasises rigid social order, Taoism is a philosophy of change and flexibility that

237
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:30,080
emphasises the need to flow with the forces that surround us. The Lave of Heaven, with its failed

238
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:38,560
experiments in reshaping human social order, is Le Guin's most complex thought experiment on the

239
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:46,720
question of, is a better world possible? And what if the New World turns out not to be better

240
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:54,720
at all? It's a book that asks hard questions about the utopian vision of a better world.

241
00:29:54,720 --> 00:30:02,320
Utopianism was given a new energy by the philosophy of George Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel.

242
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:10,400
Hegel built on the idealism of Kant to argue that the structures of the human mind didn't just

243
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:18,720
shape our perception of reality, but the history and development of human civilisation. History,

244
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:27,200
Hegel argued, had a shape. And by understanding that shape, we could progress to the end of history,

245
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:35,840
where a better world was possible. Hegel's ideas influenced both liberal and socialist

246
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:43,360
utopian dreams. But the most famous thinker to be inspired by the Hegelian model of history was

247
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:52,080
Karl Marx, father of Marxism. Marx's ideas for a communist utopia at the end of history were

248
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:57,360
so convincing to people who dreamed of a better world that communist revolutions

249
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:06,080
spread worldwide in the 20th century. But time and again, these utopian revolutions served

250
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:13,200
not the workers, but a new intellectual elite who had the intelligence and strength of will

251
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:20,080
to lead such revolutions. Like George Orr, the workers of the world discovered they did have

252
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:27,200
the power to make a better world, but that power was taken from them by men of stronger will,

253
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:37,040
like William Haber, or Joseph Stalin, or Mao Zedong, or Adolf Hitler, or Fidel Castro,

254
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:43,120
the Cuban dictator who famously declared a better world is possible.

255
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:50,640
All fiction is metaphor. Science fiction is metaphor.

256
00:31:53,360 --> 00:32:02,480
The lave of heaven is metaphor for the human will to power. No lone man can reshape reality with his

257
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:10,720
dreams, but the human collective has it within our power to create almost any reality we can dream

258
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:19,520
or imagine. But whose dreams? Whose imagination will be made real? Whose will has the power?

259
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:26,320
Science fiction in its golden age, under John W. Campbell, created metaphors for the philosophy

260
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:32,000
of realism and naturalism. It expressed the dreams of rational men who believed the world

261
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,800
could be made better with science and technology. But as those dreams became real, as the space

262
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:45,520
rockets, nuclear weapons, and artificial intelligence of sci-fi dreams came into reality,

263
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:54,560
they failed to make a better world. Technology is just a tool in the hands of humans driven by human

264
00:32:54,560 --> 00:33:03,360
ideas. Ursula Le Guin was not alone in challenging Campbellian science fiction. Other authors of

265
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:10,560
the new wave, like Samuel Delaney and J. G. Ballard, joined her. But Le Guin's stories have

266
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:16,560
proved the most long-lasting because they are the most powerful metaphors for the philosophy

267
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:23,920
that challenges materialism, the philosophy of idealism. To make a better world, Le Guin argues,

268
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:31,440
we need to understand the inner world of imagination and dreams that shape the outer world.

269
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:37,200
In this essay, we've looked at some of the philosophical ideas that Ursula Le Guin's stories

270
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:43,920
echo. I'm not suggesting Ursula Le Guin set out to create metaphors for Kantian idealism,

271
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:50,800
but rather that Le Guin, as a great thinker and creator, was discovering for herself new ways

272
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:59,440
of conceptualizing reality. And by expressing those ideas in stories, Le Guin became one of,

273
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:07,280
or perhaps the greatest, philosopher poets of our time. If we were to give Ursula Le Guin's

274
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:16,240
philosophy a name, we might call it radical idealism. Radical in three senses. Firstly,

275
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:22,480
that it models a pure idealism, in which language, archetypes of the unconscious,

276
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:30,960
and the conceptual structures of mind create our reality. Secondly, that there is a power

277
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:38,960
in knowing the true names at the root of reality, and that fundamental concepts like gender and

278
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:48,000
identity can be controlled and changed. Thirdly, that control over the root concepts of reality

279
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:56,400
should serve radical social change. The danger of Ursula Le Guin's philosophy of radical idealism

280
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:04,720
is twofold. Firstly, there is the haunting question of whose reality. As we awaken to the

281
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:13,360
potential of the human collective will to reshape our reality in the image of our dreams and stories,

282
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:22,160
we need to beware that our dreams do not become nightmares, and that the story we tell is a good

283
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:30,000
one. There is the constant threat that those who win the fight for reality are those with the strongest

284
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:38,880
will, but the least wisdom, the demi urges of our time. The second danger is less obvious,

285
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:45,760
but more immediate. If we accept the idealist model that the mind and imagination can,

286
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:52,960
in some sense, shape reality, then it's clear that we aren't the first to realise this.

287
00:35:53,680 --> 00:36:00,160
Those with real power have always known it. Caesars and kings, politicians and popes,

288
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:09,120
billionaires and media magnates all know that part of their power rests on controlling the

289
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:17,840
narrative, shaping the ideas and concepts that in turn shape our reality. The power of Ursula

290
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:26,080
Le Guin's storytelling is that it reaches into our dreams and imagination. It weaves meaning

291
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:35,280
from symbol, metaphor and archetype. It crafts mythic stories to awaken all who read it to the

292
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:43,840
deep truths of our reality, truths that are no longer hidden and secret, but are now being learned
