0	9040	We live in capitalism. Its power seems inescapable. So did the divine right of kings. Any human power
9040	17760	can be resisted and changed by human beings. Resistance and change often begin in art,
17760	20880	very often in our art, the art of the words.
24000	29840	Ursula Croba Le Guin was among the most acclaimed and respected science fiction writers
29840	36400	of the 20th century, a best-selling author in 40 languages, multiple winner of the Hugo and Nebula
36400	44400	Awards, and inspiration to generations who have followed her. Here in the 21st century Le Guin
44400	53040	has become something more than a beloved author. She has become an icon. She may be the only classic
53040	61680	sci-fi writer to regularly trend on TikTok. Ursula Le Guin is one of my favorite authors.
61680	68560	Science fiction is the art that builds worlds. In her science fiction stories, Ursula Le Guin didn't
68560	74960	just tell us a better world was possible, she showed us better worlds by building them in the
74960	81680	imagination of generations, worlds where life is fairer, more equal, and more just.
83440	88960	At this point in time, when a better world seems to be slipping through our fingers,
88960	95040	I want to understand the better worlds that Ursula Le Guin showed us. I want to dig down
95040	103360	to the big ideas that shaped Le Guin's storytelling. I want to understand not just Ursula Le Guin,
103360	107920	the sci-fi writer, but Ursula Le Guin, the philosopher.
110160	116000	Through the medium of sci-fi and fantasy, Ursula Le Guin spoke a powerful philosophy,
116000	121120	a philosophy that shows us how the art of words can resist and change the world,
121840	129040	in which human imagination, our ideas and feelings, our dreams and visions, and the very stories we
129040	137440	tell have the power to shape reality. It's a philosophy of immense power, the power to build
137440	147040	worlds and the power to destroy them. Wait, wait, wait right there. We're talking about a
147040	153200	kid's fantasy author, the lady who wrote those dragon books, right? Well, you might be confusing
153200	159760	the subject of this essay with Anne McCaffrey, or Jane Yolen, or any of the intelligent sci-fi
159760	165920	and fantasy writers who have created beautiful and politically relevant stories for children.
166480	172880	If you mean to change the world, where better to start than the dreams of the young? Ursula
172880	178640	Le Guin's career stretched over six decades, but the work she remains most famous for,
179200	185680	and that we're going to be thinking about here, were created in a brief few years between 1968 and
185680	194000	1974. Think of these as Le Guin's Bob Dylan years, when she created the tunes most of us still
194000	199600	hum along to. That's not to reduce the rest of Le Guin's career, but here we're thinking about
199600	206080	the core philosophy of Le Guin, her big ideas. You don't need to have read these books to follow
206080	211440	this, and we won't be spoiling them. In fact, we're not going to be talking about most of what's
211440	217440	special about these stories, not the quality of Le Guin's writing or her poetic imagery.
218000	225600	We're just going to find the big ideas that are the philosophy of Ursula Le Guin. To do that,
225600	230400	we're going to name check a number of famed philosophers. You don't need to know who Emmanuel
230400	237120	Kant is, have read Hegel or any of the German idealists, but if you want to go deeper into
237120	243840	philosophy, I recommend the channel of Professor Michael Sugru as an excellent guide. If things
243840	251680	get a bit too abstract and confusing along the way, just hang on, we'll try to bring it all together
252400	260560	at the end. Okay. The Left Hand of Darkness, published in 1969, The Lave of Heaven, 1971,
260560	269600	and the dispossessed 1974, defined Le Guin as a science fiction author. In a unique achievement,
269600	276960	Le Guin simultaneously wrote and published a fantasy trilogy. The Wizard of Earth, see 1968,
277040	286720	The Tombs of Attuan, 1970, and the farthest shore, 1972. And for good measure, in 1973, Le Guin
286720	294240	published The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas, one of the most famous science fiction stories ever
294240	301120	published. What kind of music do you usually have here? Oh, we got both kinds. We got country and
301600	309680	science fiction. Surely, Omelas is a fantasy story. Le Guin was one of many authors who saw
309680	316800	science fiction and fantasy as flip sides of the same coin. All fiction is metaphor. Science
316800	322320	fiction is metaphor. Le Guin argues in her introduction to the Left Hand of Darkness,
322880	330000	but metaphor for what? Keep that question in mind on our journey. To understand Le Guin's writing
330000	336000	and her philosophy, we need to place her in context as a woman writer working in the male
336000	342800	dominated field of American science fiction of the late 1960s. The women on your planet are
342800	350720	logical. That's the only planet in this galaxy that can make that claim. A machine does not care.
351280	359280	Tom Godwin, The Cold Equations. The Cold Equations, 1954, is a science fiction story Ursula Le Guin
359280	366400	would have read when she was a young writer and fan of Amazing Stories magazine. It tells of a young
366400	374240	woman who stows away on a spacecraft, but the ship only has fuel for its mission. So the cold
374240	381760	equations of reality dictates the girl must be blown out of the airlock. It's widely believed
381760	388480	that while the story was offered by Tom Godwin, it's rather incredible ending the young woman
388480	395760	willingly accepts her sacrifice was dictated by the legendary editor of Amazing Stories magazine,
396400	401760	John W. Campbell. Campbell shaped the field of American science fiction, which grew up in the
401760	408960	pulp magazines of the early 20th century around the idea of stories that extrapolated current
408960	416800	science into the future. Campbell formalized the label science fiction to describe such stories.
417600	426800	The Cold Equations exemplifies Cambalian sci-fi that sees reality as a set of cold hard facts
426800	434880	sitting out in the void of space. Reality as a machine that does not care. And Cambalian sci-fi
434880	442400	displayed a casual disregard for women whom it frequently caricatured as unreasoning creatures
442400	450880	who put feelings before the cold hard equations of reality. Early science fiction was created by
450880	456960	women writers like Margaret Cavendish and Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley. Hundreds of other women
456960	465360	writers for the 18th and 19th centuries imagined a diverse array of utopian and feminist futures.
465360	471760	You can learn more in my podcast episode about the true history of science fiction,
471760	478400	but Cambalian science fiction largely wrote women out of the field. The history of science fiction
478400	485920	was rewritten to start with Jules Verne and H.G. Wells, relative latecomers, and the definition
485920	494080	of science fiction was narrowed to exclude those earlier feminist utopias and include only pure
494080	503360	scientific speculation. The ones who walk away from Omelas 1973 can be read as a rejoinder to
503360	511360	stories like the Cold Equations. Both are short stories that use a kind of reductio ad absurdum,
511360	519520	pushing an argument that limits of logic to show where it breaks. The city of Omelas is a perfect
519520	529040	utopia except for one child who is held prisoner to suffer for all. Most in Omelas accept this
529040	536080	bargain, but the ones who walk away from Omelas exemplify a higher morality, rejecting injustice
536080	542960	and accepting the unknown, perhaps even death instead. In her introduction to her debut novel
543040	546720	The Left Hand of Darkness, written some years after its publication,
547280	554800	Le Guin devastates the Cambalian idea of speculative sci-fi stating that it always arrives
554800	562000	somewhere between the gradual extinction of human liberty and the total extinction of human life.
562560	568080	If the Cold Equations argues that reality is a machine that does not care,
568080	575200	Omelas replies, even so, the only moral path is to resist whatever the consequence is.
575840	582000	And so the gauntlet was thrown down for a clash of philosophies between Cambalian sci-fi
582720	590640	versus Ursula Le Guin. Cambalian sci-fi believed a better world could be made by science and
590640	596800	technology. Any problem could be fixed by just building bigger and better machines,
596800	601360	that the natural universe is made of matter, particles and forces,
601920	607600	an uncaring machine governed by the cold equations of reality. We can call this the
607600	614960	philosophy of materialism, realism or naturalism. Ursula Le Guin was a revolutionary force in
614960	620880	science fiction because she championed an alternate philosophy, a philosophical school
620880	627600	which argues that the human world is shaped by human thinking, that the universe and everything in
627600	636560	it are the product of human mental formations, of human ideas, the philosophy of idealism.
636560	643680	I think hard times are coming when we will be wanting the voices of writers who can see alternatives,
643680	652240	can see through our fear-stricken society and its obsessive technologies to other ways of being.
652880	659440	We will need writers who can remember freedom, the realists of a larger reality.
665920	670560	The left hand of darkness explores one of the most controversial
670560	680080	and politically charged issues of our time, gender. Genly I is a man on a mission to invite the
680080	687840	planet of Geffen to join the Ecumen, a political alliance trying to re-establish galactic civilization.
688400	696160	The people of Geffen have no fixed gender identities, which Genly is very slow to understand.
696800	702720	He forms a deep relationship with a Geffen native, but is unable to overcome his gender
702720	710720	perceptions to recognize that he's in love. Our entire pattern of socio-sexual interaction
710720	718080	is non-existent here. They cannot play the game. They do not see one another as men or women.
718080	724480	This is almost impossible for our imagination to accept. What is the first question we ask
724480	730400	about a newborn baby? Ursula K. Le Guin, the left hand of darkness. Even when the left hand of
730400	737760	darkness was written, women were still seen as the second sex. Evolution and biology materialist
737760	745040	philosophy argued had made women smaller, weaker, even less intelligent. Their role was as second
745040	752800	class citizens, if they were citizens at all. Those were the cold equations of gender, understood
752800	759360	through the dominant materialist philosophy. That was reality. Feminist philosophers from
759360	768560	Simone de Beauvoir to Judith Butler argued instead that gender was performative. Sex may be biologically
768560	775360	determined, but contributed only a part to the performance of gender. In opposition to the
775360	783280	dominant realist concept of gender was constructed an alternative idealist philosophy. Gender was
783280	791680	a mental concept, an idea that could be changed or even abandoned. In the imagined world of Geffen,
792400	800640	Le Guin is able to model gender performativity to see what remains behind after gender is removed.
801200	806640	The left hand of darkness became a classic work of science fiction because it moved
806640	813040	the idealist philosophy of gender performativity out of the realm of theory and into the powerful
813040	820720	world of story. Ursula Le Guin completed seven novels in the heinous sequence, each exploring
820720	827760	radical ideas that would influence science fiction authors who followed, including Ian M. Banks and
827760	835280	Anne Leckie. The dispossessed is arguably the most radical of Le Guin's novels. A refugee
835280	841840	scientist, the creator of Le Guin's famous Ansible, travels from the anarchist utopia of
841840	849120	Anárez to the capitalist nation of Urás. Like any good utopia, since Thomas More defined the
849120	856960	concept in his 1516 book of that title, the dispossessed imagines a world run under a single
856960	863840	political ideology, anarchism in this case, and what the consequences might be. The outcome
863840	870080	is equivocal, as Le Guin concedes in her book's subtitle, An Ambiguous Utopia.
870080	877120	Anarchism is a political ideology built on idealist philosophy. It asserts that humans
877120	884240	are not simply products of nature driven by greed and violence in a fight for survival. Instead,
884320	892800	human ideas about humanity, like justice, fairness and peace, are fundamental to human existence.
892800	899280	Anarchism has its roots with idealist philosophers like Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who believed in the
899280	906480	essential goodness of humanity. Remove unjust social structures like kings and governments,
906480	914720	Rousseau argued, and human goodness would flourish. Rousseau's ideas directly inspired both the
914720	923040	French and American revolutions, fought in the name of ideas like liberty, freedom and equality.
923040	930480	If Le Guin's anarchist utopia is ambiguous, it's because real world anarchies are too.
930480	936080	The anarchy that followed the French Revolution cost thousands of lives to the guillotine,
936080	943120	and the American Revolution produced not an anarchist utopia, but modern capitalism.
943120	948880	But the idealist philosophy of the dispossessed goes even deeper than politics.
949520	958480	Le Guin takes on one of the most fundamental arguments in philosophy, the concept of time itself.
958480	965440	The refugee scientist Chevek is developing a new theory of time that will lead to the
965440	971600	creation of the Ansible, Le Guin's famous invention for faster-than-light communication.
971600	977360	But Chevek's theory arises not from a breakthrough discovery of quantum physics,
978080	987040	but from an insight into the shape of time. Time has two aspects. There is the arrow,
987040	993280	the running river, without which there is no change, no progress, or direction, or creation.
994000	1000960	And there is the circle, or the cycle, without which there is chaos, a meaningless progression
1000960	1009040	of instance, a world without clocks, or seasons, or promises. A silicae Le Guin, the dispossessed.
1009040	1016400	Le Guin's concept of time is mirrored in the great-granddaddy of idealist philosophy, Emmanuel
1016400	1024480	Kant. Kant famously, and rather controversially classified, both time and space, not as things
1024480	1033520	happening out there in the universe, but as categories of human perception. Space and time
1033520	1040880	are the framework within which the mind is constrained to construct its experience of reality.
1040880	1048000	Kant argued that humans could only ever perceive reality through the structures of our mind.
1048640	1055680	The reality beyond these structures, the thing itself, could never be known. Space,
1055680	1063280	time, objects, movement, relationship were not the true phenomena of reality, but the phenomena
1063840	1070240	of the mind. Later idealist philosophers would ask the question, how are the structures of the
1070240	1078160	mind formed? The answer that would revolutionize modern philosophy was language, that the structures
1078160	1086560	of the mind and the reality we experience are shaped by the language we speak. Languages,
1086560	1094160	as a power that can shape reality, are central to Ursula Le Guin's philosophy, not least her
1094160	1100720	Earthsea novels. And to understand Earthsea, we need to look beyond the conscious mind
1101360	1111440	and towards its dark shadow, the unconscious. The unconscious mind is co-extensive with the
1111440	1122720	universe, Ursula Le Guin, the dispossessed. Earthsea is a fantasy land, an archipelago of
1122720	1130720	islands where magic rules. Magic is practiced through language. In Earthsea, all things have
1130720	1138240	a common name and a true name. Knowing the true name of a thing gives you power over that thing.
1138880	1147120	Whether it's a cloud, a flower, a goat, or a dragon, the true name reveals the thing itself.
1147760	1153280	The Wizard of Earthsea, 1968, reaches its inciting incident when the ambitious young
1153280	1160560	wizard Ged accidentally succeeds in severing himself from his shadow. With this act, Ged,
1160560	1167680	who had been a wild and powerful young wizard, becomes meek and uncertain. To regain his power,
1167680	1175920	Ged will have to reintegrate his shadow. Ged had neither lost nor won, but naming the
1175920	1182800	shadow of his death with his own name had made himself whole. A man who, knowing his whole,
1182800	1191040	true self, cannot be used or possessed by any power other than himself. Ursula Le Guin, The
1191040	1196800	Wizard of Earthsea. The shadow and the self are central images from the psychological theories
1196800	1203920	of Carl Jung. In her essay, Myth and Archetype in Science Fiction, Ursula Le Guin talks about
1203920	1211200	the place of Jungian symbolism in her storytelling. It's clear that the Earthsea novels are expressions
1211200	1218400	of Carl Jung's theory of archetypes. The tombs of Atuan continues the Jungian fantasy.
1218400	1224400	Tenar is a young woman who has been raised as the high priestess of an arcane faith.
1225200	1232320	She is lost within a labyrinth and guided to freedom by Ged, who appears as the masculine ideal
1232320	1240320	of Tenar's dreams. The archetype, the Carl Jung, labelled the anima. Carl Jung was a
1240320	1247520	swish psychiatrist who began his career in the realist-materialist paradigm. With his mentor,
1247520	1255520	Sigmund Freud, Jung was an early explorer of the concept of the unconscious, the idea that most of
1255760	1263200	our thinking happens outside the awareness of the conscious mind. Study of the unconscious
1263200	1270800	threw Carl Jung into the deep waters of idealist philosophy. Jung was ambivalent towards
1270800	1277120	philosophers like Kant and Hegel. But the deeper he swam into the unconscious,
1277840	1285040	the more unescapable idealism became. Jung left his scientific research and spent
1285120	1291600	years in inner contemplation, producing his famous illuminated manuscript,
1291600	1300000	the Liebernovus. Jung claims to have discovered structures of the unconscious mind, structures
1300000	1309200	he called the archetypes of self, persona, shadow, anima, and more. Ursula Le Guin adopts
1309200	1317520	these ideas of the unconscious and the Jungian archetypes to rewrite the narrative of fantasy.
1317520	1323760	The war between the Dark Lord and the Good King of Tolkien's Middle Earth are replaced in Le Guin's
1323760	1333040	Earthsea with the quest for self-knowledge. The evil we must defeat is not out there in the world,
1333040	1341040	Le Guin tells her young readers, but inside our own selves. The farthest shore, the third volume
1341040	1348880	of Earthsea, introduces the darkest and most complex of the Jungian archetypes, the Demiurge,
1348880	1355680	or false god. Magic has left the land of Earthsea and Ged, now an older man, must sail
1355680	1361840	out to find the cause. The farthest shore is a haunting and challenging story. Ged is now the
1361840	1367520	mentor to a young prince, Aaron, who will complete his own hero's journey through the story.
1368240	1375840	As they travel, Aaron is tormented by doubts about his mentor, sometimes Ged appears as the
1375840	1383920	archmage of Roke, at other times he's just an ignorant old man. Earthsea has fallen under the
1383920	1391920	magic of a dark wizard named Cobb. Cobb needs no armies of orcs, he is not conquering the world.
1391920	1401280	The power of magic is to rewrite reality itself. The conflict between Ged and Cobb is about who
1401280	1407680	controls reality. The Demiurge is an archetype that dates back to at least early Christianity.
1408240	1415920	The Gnostic sect believes the Old Testament Jehovah to be a false god named Yal Leboeth.
1416800	1423280	Carl Jung described his own encounter with the Demiurge, named Abraxas in his Libanovus.
1423920	1431840	In the farthest shore, Ursula Le Guin has encountered her own Demiurge. The ending of the story is
1431840	1439120	opaque and symbolically dense. It reads as though the author is struggling to navigate
1439120	1446480	the inner world she is exploring. Le Guin is a young writer in her 40s who is unpacking these
1446480	1454160	ideas as she goes. After the furthest shore and those six years of intense creativity,
1454160	1460880	Ursula Le Guin's writing slows substantially. She doesn't return to Earthsea for 18 years,
1460880	1467600	perhaps she is searching for answers to the questions raised by her philosophical questing
1468240	1474720	and her encounter with the Demiurge and the dangers that encounter revealed.
1475840	1483760	To begin to pull all these ideas together and before we dive into a final Le Guin story,
1484560	1492800	let's think more about philosophy. Philosophy means love of wisdom. From the Greek philo,
1493360	1502480	a form of love and Sophia, the goddess of wisdom. Only a fool would think that a philosophy without
1502480	1512000	women would be wise. But as is widely noted, the canon of philosophy features almost no women.
1512000	1519440	The storyteller and philosopher Clarissa Pincola Estes suggests that women have instead
1519440	1527920	passed their wisdom down through stories. It's increasingly recognised that many of the greatest
1527920	1536000	mythic stories passed down through history were perhaps offered by women. The anonymous J
1536000	1544160	author of the Genesis Myths was a Babylonian princess. God may not be a woman, but his script
1544160	1552000	writer was. Analysis of the Odyssey suggests Homer was a woman writer satirising the toxic
1552000	1558880	masculinity of the classical era. European folklore is stamped with the names of Hans Christian Anderson
1558880	1566000	and the Brothers Grimm, but these were stories told by women for women, about women.
1567440	1574800	Add in those women writers who created science fiction, their names scrubbed from its history,
1575520	1583360	and we have a pattern forming. To give Ursula Le Guin her full due, we must think of her in
1583440	1590720	that tradition of great women storytellers, philosopher poets who express their wisdom
1590720	1599120	in stories. That Le Guin stories are not only great science fiction, but mythic stories that
1599120	1606880	express a deep and powerful philosophy. And as she explored the power of this philosophy,
1606880	1614320	Ursula Le Guin also considered the dangers that came with such power in the archetypal figure
1614880	1624320	of the demiurge. Ursula Le Guin titled The Lave of Heaven after a mistranslation
1624320	1632160	from the Taoist poet Zhuangzi. That mistake aside, the title poetically captures the essence
1632160	1640400	of Le Guin's philosophy. George Orr, a likely nod to Orwell in 1984, is an ordinary man who
1640400	1649120	believes his dreams can change reality. But instead of using this power for himself, Orr is exploited
1649120	1656880	by the psychologist William Harbour, a man of stronger will. Harbour's various attempts to
1656880	1664480	shape Orr's dreams to make a better world all result in a worse world, but make Harbour ever
1664480	1672480	more powerful. The strength of Harbour's will allows him to control reality until Orr fights back.
1673200	1679840	The conflict between Orr and Harbour in The Lave of Heaven mirrors the conflict between Ged
1679840	1686560	and Cobb in The Father's Shore. Both are encounters with the demiurge archetype,
1686560	1693360	conflicts over the most fundamental question. If human willpower can reshape reality,
1694000	1701600	the question becomes who's will? It's kind of like old fairy tales where somebody's trying to do good
1701600	1707040	and is always sort of defeated by reality. You've got to go with the flow. You can't push the river,
1707040	1713600	as the Buddhists say. And Poor Harbour in the book is a do-gooder, but George is sort of in tune
1713600	1720240	with things. Go with the flow man. Go with the flow man. And of course, this is a Taoist book.
1721280	1726640	The Taoism was pretty conscious. What do you mean by that? A lot of people say,
1726640	1732960	what does she mean, a Taoist book? Well, in the Buddhist sense, the Taoism says you do things
1732960	1739760	by not doing things. And all attempt to do and to set things right and to make things happen
1741840	1749920	eventually backfires. The Lave of Heaven is Le Guin's Taoist novel. Le Guin had a lifelong
1749920	1755920	interest in the Eastern philosophy of Taoism. In contrast to the Confucian tradition that
1755920	1762800	emphasises rigid social order, Taoism is a philosophy of change and flexibility that
1762800	1770080	emphasises the need to flow with the forces that surround us. The Lave of Heaven, with its failed
1770080	1778560	experiments in reshaping human social order, is Le Guin's most complex thought experiment on the
1778560	1786720	question of, is a better world possible? And what if the New World turns out not to be better
1786720	1794720	at all? It's a book that asks hard questions about the utopian vision of a better world.
1794720	1802320	Utopianism was given a new energy by the philosophy of George Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel.
1803040	1810400	Hegel built on the idealism of Kant to argue that the structures of the human mind didn't just
1810400	1818720	shape our perception of reality, but the history and development of human civilisation. History,
1818720	1827200	Hegel argued, had a shape. And by understanding that shape, we could progress to the end of history,
1827840	1835840	where a better world was possible. Hegel's ideas influenced both liberal and socialist
1835840	1843360	utopian dreams. But the most famous thinker to be inspired by the Hegelian model of history was
1844000	1852080	Karl Marx, father of Marxism. Marx's ideas for a communist utopia at the end of history were
1852080	1857360	so convincing to people who dreamed of a better world that communist revolutions
1857360	1866080	spread worldwide in the 20th century. But time and again, these utopian revolutions served
1866080	1873200	not the workers, but a new intellectual elite who had the intelligence and strength of will
1873200	1880080	to lead such revolutions. Like George Orr, the workers of the world discovered they did have
1880080	1887200	the power to make a better world, but that power was taken from them by men of stronger will,
1887200	1897040	like William Haber, or Joseph Stalin, or Mao Zedong, or Adolf Hitler, or Fidel Castro,
1897040	1903120	the Cuban dictator who famously declared a better world is possible.
1903840	1910640	All fiction is metaphor. Science fiction is metaphor.
1913360	1922480	The lave of heaven is metaphor for the human will to power. No lone man can reshape reality with his
1922480	1930720	dreams, but the human collective has it within our power to create almost any reality we can dream
1930720	1939520	or imagine. But whose dreams? Whose imagination will be made real? Whose will has the power?
1940320	1946320	Science fiction in its golden age, under John W. Campbell, created metaphors for the philosophy
1946320	1952000	of realism and naturalism. It expressed the dreams of rational men who believed the world
1952000	1958800	could be made better with science and technology. But as those dreams became real, as the space
1958800	1965520	rockets, nuclear weapons, and artificial intelligence of sci-fi dreams came into reality,
1966400	1974560	they failed to make a better world. Technology is just a tool in the hands of humans driven by human
1974560	1983360	ideas. Ursula Le Guin was not alone in challenging Campbellian science fiction. Other authors of
1983360	1990560	the new wave, like Samuel Delaney and J. G. Ballard, joined her. But Le Guin's stories have
1990560	1996560	proved the most long-lasting because they are the most powerful metaphors for the philosophy
1996560	2003920	that challenges materialism, the philosophy of idealism. To make a better world, Le Guin argues,
2003920	2011440	we need to understand the inner world of imagination and dreams that shape the outer world.
2011440	2017200	In this essay, we've looked at some of the philosophical ideas that Ursula Le Guin's stories
2017200	2023920	echo. I'm not suggesting Ursula Le Guin set out to create metaphors for Kantian idealism,
2024480	2030800	but rather that Le Guin, as a great thinker and creator, was discovering for herself new ways
2030800	2039440	of conceptualizing reality. And by expressing those ideas in stories, Le Guin became one of,
2040080	2047280	or perhaps the greatest, philosopher poets of our time. If we were to give Ursula Le Guin's
2047280	2056240	philosophy a name, we might call it radical idealism. Radical in three senses. Firstly,
2056240	2062480	that it models a pure idealism, in which language, archetypes of the unconscious,
2062480	2070960	and the conceptual structures of mind create our reality. Secondly, that there is a power
2070960	2078960	in knowing the true names at the root of reality, and that fundamental concepts like gender and
2078960	2088000	identity can be controlled and changed. Thirdly, that control over the root concepts of reality
2088080	2096400	should serve radical social change. The danger of Ursula Le Guin's philosophy of radical idealism
2096400	2104720	is twofold. Firstly, there is the haunting question of whose reality. As we awaken to the
2104720	2113360	potential of the human collective will to reshape our reality in the image of our dreams and stories,
2113920	2122160	we need to beware that our dreams do not become nightmares, and that the story we tell is a good
2122160	2130000	one. There is the constant threat that those who win the fight for reality are those with the strongest
2130000	2138880	will, but the least wisdom, the demi urges of our time. The second danger is less obvious,
2138960	2145760	but more immediate. If we accept the idealist model that the mind and imagination can,
2146320	2152960	in some sense, shape reality, then it's clear that we aren't the first to realise this.
2153680	2160160	Those with real power have always known it. Caesars and kings, politicians and popes,
2160720	2169120	billionaires and media magnates all know that part of their power rests on controlling the
2169120	2177840	narrative, shaping the ideas and concepts that in turn shape our reality. The power of Ursula
2177840	2186080	Le Guin's storytelling is that it reaches into our dreams and imagination. It weaves meaning
2186080	2195280	from symbol, metaphor and archetype. It crafts mythic stories to awaken all who read it to the
2195280	2203840	deep truths of our reality, truths that are no longer hidden and secret, but are now being learned
2204480	2211520	by all. Ursula Le Guin's philosophy is dangerous because it awakens the once powerless
2212080	2221520	to the potential of our own power. Those who cling to unjust power over others might find that
2222080	2229280	very dangerous indeed. Listen to the long-form audio commentary on the dangerous philosophy of
