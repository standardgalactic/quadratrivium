00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
But when you mistake a map for the world, you've made a huge error, and I believe that's where we now are.

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
These seem to be the primary paths to reality. One is science, another is reason.

00:14.000 --> 00:23.000
A third is imagination, and a force is intuition. And we live in an era in which imagination and intuition have been sort of tarnished as false.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
Hello and welcome to the Science Fiction podcast with Daniel Walter.

00:27.000 --> 00:36.000
Long-term listeners to the podcast will have followed our evolving journey in what we're talking about when we talk about science fiction.

00:36.000 --> 00:45.000
So sometimes the Science Fiction podcast is a fancast for Denis Villeneuve and his upcoming June 2 movie.

00:45.000 --> 00:54.000
But we're also trying to discuss the what happens when science and fiction meet.

00:54.000 --> 01:03.000
These apparently very two opposite things, science, which is all about the facts and realities of our world and fiction, which is all about the stories.

01:03.000 --> 01:10.000
And we've encapsulated this in our logo with a series of words that represent something of a duality.

01:10.000 --> 01:20.000
So science and fiction, reality and fantasy, reason and emotion and mythos and logos.

01:20.000 --> 01:32.000
And I'm incredibly honored today to be joined by, I think, the leading thinker in the world about this apparent division that runs through our culture

01:32.000 --> 01:43.000
and seems to run through humanity. And it seems to run really down the center of our brain and the two hemispheres of our brain.

01:43.000 --> 01:48.000
So I'm really happy to welcome Ian McGillchrist. Hello and welcome, Ian.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
Oh, thank you, Damon. I'm delighted to be here.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
Well, thank you for joining me. It is literally a tremendous honor.

01:53.000 --> 02:04.000
I've spent dozens and dozens of hours listening to you on other people's podcasts and to your audio explorations of your most recent book as well.

02:04.000 --> 02:12.000
I wonder if I can ask you, I hope this isn't a left field question for you, and it would be totally okay to say no.

02:12.000 --> 02:19.000
But do you have any relationship to science fiction? Would you say you're a science fiction fan?

02:19.000 --> 02:26.000
Some people really dislike science fiction, and if that was you, that would be fine as well. That would be an interesting direction.

02:26.000 --> 02:31.000
No, I mean, I certainly don't dislike science fiction. I don't know a lot of science fiction.

02:31.000 --> 02:47.000
And one of the sad things about the last 30 years is that I've had to keep up with so many science and philosophy books that I haven't really had much time for reading things that are sort of perhaps more tangential,

02:47.000 --> 02:58.000
but nonetheless important. There are some works of science fiction that I consider of colossal status, and one is Stanislas Lem's Solaris.

02:58.000 --> 03:07.000
And I think that Tarkovsky's exploration of it is extraordinarily inexhaustibly deep. I've seen it many, many times.

03:07.000 --> 03:14.000
I've also seen the other film called Solaris Made in America, but it was so disappointing that I don't refer to it anymore.

03:14.000 --> 03:29.000
But there's that. And I've also been reading something that probably isn't science fiction exactly, which is C.S. Lewis's, he did three, a three-part trilogy.

03:29.000 --> 03:42.000
And I've only read the third part, which is called that hideous strength. And it is a kind of science fiction, but it's also very much a sort of mythology, and it's very powerful.

03:42.000 --> 03:50.000
And very prescient, by the way. I mean, in 1945 or whenever he was writing it, he was foreseeing things that have happened recently.

03:50.000 --> 03:59.000
Fantastic. That was one of my introductions to science fiction. And yes, I would definitely say that Lewis's space trilogy is science fiction.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
Yes.

04:00.000 --> 04:15.000
And also, of course, theological as well. And as always, definitely creating a myth for the future, which is one of the ways that I discuss science fiction.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
I talk about science fiction as modern mythmaking.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
Yes.

04:19.000 --> 04:32.000
So Tolkien is, I mean, generally considered a fantasy writer, but fantasy and science fiction are very related. And he had his ideas of myth appear, the creation of myths for the world.

04:32.000 --> 04:41.000
No, I was hoping that we would explore some of this overlap with myth and science fiction between us today.

04:41.000 --> 04:59.000
Absolutely. Yes. Yes. Well, as you know, because you've read my work, mythos in the ancient Greek was prior to and more important than logos from which we derive the word logic.

04:59.000 --> 05:09.000
I mean, logos didn't mean logic in those days. It meant things that were more explicit. It meant things that you could argue for in a court of law or, you know, in a debate.

05:09.000 --> 05:27.000
But mythos was the only way of capturing the really serious, important, emotional, philosophical thoughts about the world that are hard to put into everyday language, but are nonetheless important for that.

05:27.000 --> 05:42.000
And we seem to live in a time where for a long time, especially in Western culture, we seem to maybe deny mythos to say it wasn't significant to us anymore.

05:42.000 --> 05:48.000
We could be a culture purely of logos. And I know we're going to get more into this with your ideas.

05:48.000 --> 05:59.000
But then I see the way that our attempt to do that was completely futile because the mythos is really more powerful than we are.

05:59.000 --> 06:09.000
And it just exploded up again. And one major way of that happening was science fiction and the huge popularity of, of course, things like Star Wars and Star Trek.

06:10.000 --> 06:19.000
But movies like 2001, and of course the popularity of writers like, like Lewis, who make this explicitly theological as well.

06:19.000 --> 06:28.000
Yes, yes. Your expression, it's bigger than we are, is rather important, I think.

06:28.000 --> 06:36.000
There's a sense in which these things are not made up, but are permitted by us to come to expression.

06:36.000 --> 06:47.000
And when one is writing the most difficult to express things, and then suddenly poetry, of which I have a little experienced,

06:47.000 --> 06:58.000
one feels that something is writing through you. It's not that it doesn't use you and take part of you into it, but it's not just coming out of view.

06:58.000 --> 07:06.000
That's the very strong feeling one has. And so many artists and writers have reported very much the same phenomenon.

07:06.000 --> 07:14.000
Yeah, absolutely. That was, I think we'll get to that in one of my questions. I don't want to pre-empt too much here.

07:14.000 --> 07:25.000
What I'd like to do for my listeners is discuss your work for which you're best known, which is articulated in two books.

07:25.000 --> 07:35.000
The Master and His Emissary in 2009, and The Matter with Things in 2021. Both very significant books.

07:35.000 --> 07:48.000
I think I cropped up a couple of times in your live events as the person who said that The Matter with Things is a three and a half pencil book to get through it

07:48.000 --> 07:58.000
and deal with all of the questions that come up. And the complete works of Shakespeare is only two and a half pencils.

07:58.000 --> 08:14.000
But would it be fair to say that The Master and His Emissary is your thesis of the dual hemispheric model, and then The Matter with Things is the extended philosophy?

08:14.000 --> 08:28.000
I think that's a good way of putting it. The only thing I would add to that is that I explored literature that wasn't available when I first was writing The Master and His Emissary.

08:28.000 --> 08:42.000
And so in The Matter with Things, I include a great deal more neuro-psychological evidence. I think it's about 6,000 papers and sources that are referred to there.

08:42.000 --> 08:48.000
So nobody can say there's no evidence. That doesn't stop some people saying that without having looked at my books.

08:48.000 --> 08:58.000
I'm trying to get beyond that. So yes, it is. And it's saying what the philosophical encourt of all this is.

08:58.000 --> 09:08.000
In a second, I'm going to ask you to give your summary, I guess, which you must be very used to doing by now.

09:08.000 --> 09:21.000
I think one of the important points is that this does have these very deep roots in scientific research in various areas that you have crossed into.

09:21.000 --> 09:34.000
So that separates it from the pop culture idea of hemispheres, which people are quite familiar with, and then have also heard it is no longer valid.

09:34.000 --> 09:52.000
So that's something to say that this goes significantly beyond that idea. And also it has a lot of similarities to a long history of thinking about the world that we might think of through the mythos or even through religions.

09:53.000 --> 10:09.000
And perhaps even ideas today, like you've talked to people about John the Vakie, about meaning and so on. It crosses into all of these areas, but yours seems to be the most scientifically rigorous of them.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
Is that fair, do you think?

10:11.000 --> 10:27.000
I think so, yes. And it's not only that I take up this unpopular issue of hemisphere difference, but I come to quite different conclusions from the ones that made their way into popular culture.

10:27.000 --> 10:35.000
So the first hurdle I always have to get over is, oh, all that stuff about hemispheres was exploded long ago. It's pop science and it's nonsense.

10:35.000 --> 10:48.000
Well, it's true that most of, not all, but most of what was said about hemisphere differences was wrong. But perhaps I could explain what I think is important about the difference.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
Please do.

10:50.000 --> 11:00.000
First of all, it's a very evolutionarily verifiable hypothesis, if you like.

11:00.000 --> 11:16.000
The idea is that the two hemispheres of the brain evolved differently, not just in human beings, but in pretty much all creatures we've looked at, to solve a particular problem, which is how to pay two kinds of attention to the world at the same time.

11:16.000 --> 11:26.000
One kind of attention is required for survival in the simplest sense, that we need to get stuff, we need to grab food, we need to catch a rabbit, we need to pick up a seed, whatever it is.

11:26.000 --> 11:34.000
And we need also to be able to manipulate our environment to pick things up and build things and use tools and so on in the case of human beings.

11:34.000 --> 11:49.000
So, in fact, as far back as we can go in history, 700 million years, we know that the neural networks that formed the ancestors of the human brain were asymmetrical, which is interesting in itself.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
Why were they asymmetrical?

11:52.000 --> 12:05.000
And I think the reason for this was that, as I say, two kinds of attention need to be paid. One is the one with which we grab things, and so this is the one subtended by us, in us, by the left hemisphere.

12:05.000 --> 12:20.000
And it therefore pays attention to something that we already know what it is, we know we want it, and we need to get it, and so it focuses in a targeted way, a very narrow beam of attention that brings clarity.

12:20.000 --> 12:26.000
But the difficulty with this is that it is not seeing everything else that's going on at the same time.

12:26.000 --> 12:38.000
And so in order to survive, you also need to be looking out for predators, not just predators, but also for your kin, for your offspring, for your mate, for your kind.

12:38.000 --> 12:58.000
And to do this, you need precisely the opposite kind of attention, maximally open, undedicated yet as to what it may find, and broad, sustained, and on the lookout vigilant.

12:58.000 --> 13:06.000
So, very different from this, I know what it is, I want to get it, it's a detail. The right hemisphere is looking out for the whole of the rest of it.

13:06.000 --> 13:21.000
So, the one thing that was probably true about what people used to say was that the left hemisphere had a narrow attention and the right hemisphere broad attention, and that's not disputed by anyone in the world, and it's a very well-attested fact.

13:21.000 --> 13:34.000
But what people were not aware of so much was that attention creates the experiential world. What we find to be there depends on the kind of attention we pay.

13:34.000 --> 13:43.000
And there are many amusing experiments that have been done in recent years showing that we're completely blind to something we don't expect to see.

13:44.000 --> 13:54.000
And so, what follows for me is that these kinds of attention give rise to two different kinds of phenomenological worlds. What are they like?

13:54.000 --> 14:06.000
In a nutshell, the left hemisphere sees things that are already known, familiar, fixed, isolated, fragmentary, decontextualized, and examples of a kind, a category.

14:06.000 --> 14:17.000
Not unique, but oh, it's one of those. And this kind of abstracted thinking is a useful tool, but it's not very good for constructing reality.

14:17.000 --> 14:33.000
The right hemisphere sees something much more complex. It sees a world in which nothing is completely, fully known, is never completely fixed, is never completely isolated, but is ultimately in connection with everything else.

14:33.000 --> 14:52.000
It's flowing, it's changing, it's often implicit. The right hemisphere is much better, sorry, this is my right hemisphere, at picking up the stuff that is hard to detect with the kind of conscious mind.

14:53.000 --> 15:11.000
So, small changes in expression in the face, aspects of tone of voice, irony, metaphor, the language of poetry, the language of myths, it's much better at understanding the meaning of a story, whereas the left hemisphere sees it as simply a sequence of vignettes.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
It doesn't understand the overall import of what's going on.

15:14.000 --> 15:30.000
So, those are really quite different worlds. And my thesis is that the world that we're in now has come to depend very heavily on this very simple, mechanistic, theoretical vision of the world.

15:30.000 --> 15:41.000
A distinction I like to make is between presence and a representation. And a representation means literally present again after the fact, when it's actually no longer present.

15:41.000 --> 15:51.000
So, the world is present in all its richness and complexity and intuitive meaning that can never be fully grasped to the right hemisphere, which is an expert at decoding it.

15:51.000 --> 16:08.000
And the left hemisphere instead replaces reality with its own simple map of reality. Now, a map is not to be despised, a map is very useful, but when you mistake a map for the world, you've made a huge error, and I believe that's where we now are.

16:08.000 --> 16:22.000
I'd just like to add that in the ways in which we can come to a sense of what we can rely on, we need to be using, I would say, at least four things. These seem to be the primary paths to reality.

16:22.000 --> 16:34.000
One is science. Another is reason. A third is imagination and a force is intuition. And we live in an era in which imagination and intuition have been sort of tarnished as false.

16:35.000 --> 16:43.000
But actually science and reason can lead you to false conclusions unless they are sophisticated by imagination and intuition.

16:43.000 --> 16:54.000
And indeed, when you come to look at, as I have done, the stories of many great findings by mathematicians and scientists, they made these discoveries not by pursuing the scientific method as such,

16:54.000 --> 17:05.000
but by having a broad attention which saw new shapes, new forms, new, as the Germans say, gestalten, which are holes that cannot be decomposed into their parts without loss.

17:05.000 --> 17:14.000
And in each of these paths, science, reason, intuition and imagination, the right hemisphere pays the bigger part. It is actually more intelligent.

17:14.000 --> 17:21.000
It sees more. It's emotional and social intelligence. You will not be surprised to learn as greater, but it's cognitive intelligence.

17:21.000 --> 17:34.000
Its IQ is higher than that of the left, which is contrary to what a lot of people think. And it's much more able to feel its way into an understanding of what it is seeing in the world around it.

17:35.000 --> 17:59.000
But these values of imagination and intuition, I guess one way I think about it is that they give us like broad long-term outcomes and the less left hemispheric values, reason and logic seem to give us like immediate and very measurable outcomes.

17:59.000 --> 18:20.000
And they seem, I think, the reason, for instance, among the listeners of my podcast who are often very scientifically minded, there's quite a major divide, they would say, well, we get the machines and the technology from this, what they might consider the whole process of consciousness,

18:20.000 --> 18:35.000
but what you would call the left hemispheric. So is that why we currently value the left hemisphere more? Because it gives us the machines, it gives us the technology and those seem to represent all of our progress at the moment.

18:36.000 --> 18:52.000
Yes, I mean it takes us a little way and I don't know how much to go into, but to concentrate on something very clear, the left hemisphere's aim is control and power.

18:53.000 --> 19:03.000
That's why it's in service of manipulating the world and getting stuff, grabbing stuff, it controls the right hand with which for most of us we do the manipulation.

19:04.000 --> 19:24.000
And so its resultant is to increase power and machines and technology are ways of externalizing this kind of thinking, but what I want to impress on any listener is that, and the full argument is in my books,

19:25.000 --> 19:42.000
but the vision that the left hemisphere brings is woefully deficient, it's extraordinarily lacking in an understanding of context, which changes everything, of implicit meaning, of holes that can't be degraded into parts.

19:42.000 --> 19:54.000
It focuses on things that are supposedly precise and builds from there as we make a machine, but actually nothing in the world except the machines we have made has this structure, nothing.

19:54.000 --> 20:03.000
Living things certainly don't and the inanimate world also does not. It is not mechanical, it is not made in a machine-like way.

20:03.000 --> 20:11.000
So in order to understand we need to greatly sophisticate our intelligence and our insight, and this comes from espousing both hemispheres.

20:11.000 --> 20:23.000
And I'd just like to comment on the word reason. I make a distinction which is hard to make in English between what I call reason and what I call rationalization or rationalizing.

20:23.000 --> 20:33.000
And in other languages, there are two different words for this, for example, in German, what I call reason is called vernonz, and what I'm calling rationalizing is called verstand.

20:33.000 --> 20:42.000
So verstand or rationalizing is a procedural thing which you do explicitly on a paper, if this, then that, and so on and so forth. Nothing wrong with it.

20:43.000 --> 20:49.000
But there is something that's much greater than that, which is the ability to set all this into an overall context.

20:49.000 --> 21:00.000
And that's something that comes with leading a wise life, and it's the sort of thing that you would expect from a good judge that at the end of his or her career,

21:00.000 --> 21:10.000
he was able to see the whole picture and understand in the round to take into account many, many factors in reaching a conclusion.

21:10.000 --> 21:19.000
And if you do that, you are less often caught out by reality. If you purely rationalize, you make some very strange steps.

21:19.000 --> 21:29.000
An amusing thing for me is that, I mean, a lot of time in my career, I've spent with patients with schizophrenia, of course.

21:29.000 --> 21:34.000
And in schizophrenia, people talk about madness and they say it's the loss of reason.

21:34.000 --> 21:47.000
But as has been pointed out by various people, including Minkowski, a very fine Polish-French philosopher and psychiatrist in the first part of the 20th century,

21:47.000 --> 22:00.000
but also by others like G.K. Chesterton, the madman is someone who has lost everything but reason, can only rely on reason, and it leads to mad conclusions.

22:00.000 --> 22:09.000
So the person who hears a voice and there's nobody in the room thinks, well, that's strange, it's not coming from me, so what is there in this room?

22:09.000 --> 22:19.000
There's a socket over there in the wall. Somebody has wired into that, is beaming voices into my head. It's kind of logical, but of course it's utterly bonkers.

22:20.000 --> 22:32.000
So we need to be careful. Intuition can, if unguided by reason, lead to falsity, but reason unguided by intuition can surely lead to falsity.

22:32.000 --> 22:46.000
Can I lay something out for you and potentially as a mirror of this divide? Do you know Stanley Kubrick's 2001?

22:46.000 --> 22:51.000
Yes, I do. I saw it a very long time ago and I can't remember it very well.

22:51.000 --> 23:06.000
Of course. Well, it seems that we've been trying to find kind of a story for how to visualize our reality.

23:06.000 --> 23:22.000
We had a great mythos, like the Christian mythos in the Western world, and then we came more and more to science and to reason maybe these lefts hemispheric values by going too far in that direction.

23:23.000 --> 23:39.000
And then we've been trying to find like a new story to put in its place, and I think science fiction represents an attempt at that story in some ways, that we're going to build space rockets and teleporters and starships.

23:39.000 --> 23:55.000
And this will take us off into the galaxy, into the universe, but which is this completely unconscious place, just full of dead matter and maybe some alien civilizations as well.

23:55.000 --> 24:06.000
But then in a movie like 2001, Stanley Kubrick, if you remember, he shows you all of the spaceships and the satellites around Earth.

24:06.000 --> 24:12.000
But then it's not via those that we actually go out into space.

24:12.000 --> 24:27.000
He actually has the astronaut climb inside the mind of how the artificial intelligence and switch it off, and then we go on this kind of psychedelic journey into outer space.

24:27.000 --> 24:42.000
So I'm sorry to test you with a film you only vaguely remember, but does that seem to express some of this divide between the hemispheres as an idea, just in the way that I've laid it out for you?

24:42.000 --> 24:58.000
I think it does, but I caution about the divide because I make a distinction between division in the sense of complete separation and division in the sense of making a distinction.

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
And there is a distinction between these hemispheres.

25:01.000 --> 25:11.000
One of the myths that I need to stamp on is that the left hemisphere is the hemisphere of science, and the right hemisphere is the hemisphere of sort of fantasy.

25:11.000 --> 25:21.000
It certainly not. It is the hemisphere that's much better at imagination. But to go off on a hair, which I won't pursue unless you want me to, imagination is almost the opposite of fantasy.

25:21.000 --> 25:28.000
Fantasy takes us away from reality. Imagination enables us to enter into reality.

25:28.000 --> 25:37.000
But yes, I think you're right. I mean, one thing to say right away is that there is no conflict between Christianity and science.

25:37.000 --> 25:53.000
This is something that has been drummed up only since the middle of the 19th century by people who, I suppose, looking at it most charitably, they wanted to make sure that there weren't religious constraints on what could be claimed.

25:53.000 --> 26:16.000
And that, of course, I would back. But religion and the myth of Christianity, which is probably the most rich myth that we've ever created, if we created, is something that speaks of exactly what the best of the left and right hemisphere can bring about.

26:16.000 --> 26:32.000
But what happens whenever you have a myth, and if you have a religious myth, is that the left hemisphere wants to codify it. It wants to create a lot of rather odd propositions that you must sign up to, and it wants to structure it in a logical way.

26:32.000 --> 26:41.000
And so whole bodies of dogma are created by the left hemisphere, imposing this on religion, which is not the wellspring of religion.

26:41.000 --> 26:55.000
The wellspring of religion is something that is carefully responded to by patient attention, by listening to things that you don't expect to hear, understanding the speaking to you of everything around you.

26:55.000 --> 27:16.000
And so when, again, you talk about dead matter, and again, how long have you got? But I mean, you know, I argue in the matter with things that, in fact, consciousness is not something that sort of emerged late in the day out of a brain, but it is, in fact, a primary element, what's called an ontological primitive in the universe.

27:16.000 --> 27:42.000
There's so much rich stuff in there in relation to this topic. There's something that I've observed, and it's quite widely observed, often among writers of science fiction, which is that the kind of the collective imagination is more and more literal in its interpretation of any story that's given to it.

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
Absolutely.

27:43.000 --> 28:03.000
So for any half decent writer, if you're writing about space rockets and planets and alien civilizations, there's some level in which you're exploring kind of scientific ideas, but there's also the symbolic and the metaphoric and the mythic in there as well.

28:03.000 --> 28:09.000
But it's harder and harder for people to think in that way at the moment.

28:09.000 --> 28:24.000
Absolutely. And one of the most striking things for me is that the left hemisphere doesn't understand anything that is not literal. So it really doesn't understand the point of poetry. Why lie when you could say it clearly?

28:24.000 --> 28:40.000
It doesn't understand music. It doesn't understand irony. It doesn't understand sarcasm. It doesn't understand wit or humor. And so what you find is that people take everything incredibly literally and miss the point.

28:40.000 --> 28:57.000
So the vanishment of humor from public discourse in the recent years has been one of the most grievous losses to humanity that I can imagine, because in humor, although we think of it as just an entertaining element, it's actually a very profound element.

28:57.000 --> 29:18.000
And it's also got its place in spiritual traditions, above all in Zen, which uses tumor to help us see things that are not logically, reductively explicit. So, yeah, I mean, this is happening everywhere.

29:18.000 --> 29:35.000
I might say, if I may, that when I first went to America, I was working at Johns Hopkins in a neuroimaging lab. And I found that in the first few weeks, people kept looking at me, but other puzzled when I say something and they go, really?

29:35.000 --> 29:52.000
And then I'd go, no, not really, don't mind. But I hadn't realized how much of whatever I said was to be read between the lines. It was amusing. It was putting a perspective on something. But they took everything deadly seriously.

29:52.000 --> 30:06.000
And this may be an aspect of having a melting pot of cultures where you can't rely on the usual sort of things to do with the way people say thing. And so you have to deal only with the explicit. But it's now become what we have to deal with everywhere.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
Sorry, carry on, please.

30:08.000 --> 30:22.000
I had a very similar, very similar experience of doing a long writer's workshop in California. This was over a decade ago now. And I was the only English person there. And I loved everyone on the workshop.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
Yes.

30:23.000 --> 30:37.000
But I realized about two weeks into it. And I said to one of my friends that I think maybe some of the people in the group are angry with me. And my friend touched me on the knee and said, they don't, they don't realize you're being ironic.

30:37.000 --> 30:51.000
And I fought back for everything I said. And for, oh, no, they must think I'm a, I'm a terrible, terrible person. But what, so I want to dig into a bit more of what what's driving this literalism them is.

30:51.000 --> 31:06.000
I know this isn't what it is, but is, is the left hemisphere becoming bigger and and dominating us biologically? Or is there some kind of feedback mechanism in our culture? Or why are we becoming more and more?

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
Yes.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
More left hemisphere?

31:08.000 --> 31:20.000
Well, as you rightly say, it's not that the left hemisphere is getting bigger. And in fact, it's of interest that the right hemisphere is slightly bigger and heavier than the left hemisphere in humans.

31:20.000 --> 31:40.000
What is happening, I think, is that, let me just refer here to one of my favorite philosophers, A. N. Whitehead, who said that a civilization flourishes until it starts to analyze itself.

31:40.000 --> 31:55.000
And I think that what happens is that in the way we have mainly lived for thousands and thousands of years is in harmony with nature, in harmony with society, in harmony with the myths, the rituals, the beliefs of our culture.

31:55.000 --> 32:10.000
And that these had been ample ways of alerting us to many kinds of truth that was not just a kind of tit for tat in the court of law way of debating things, but certain realities could not be encompassed in that way.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
But they didn't need to be.

32:12.000 --> 32:31.000
Well, what's happened in a largely deracinated culture where people have been torn away from their communities, dragged into the cities, more and more into a world made by machines, reflecting the left hemisphere as kind of a world all around them.

32:31.000 --> 32:48.000
They look out of the window, they see mechanisms, they see hard surfaces on a rigid grid, and they are no longer in touch with what I'm honored and grateful to be in touch with here, which is being surrounded by nature.

32:48.000 --> 32:51.000
And these things teach you, they speak to you.

32:51.000 --> 33:00.000
And so I think what's happened is that in this world in which we rely very much on discourse, you have to choose what it is you say.

33:00.000 --> 33:13.000
The first thing is that the right hemisphere's story is much more complex than that of the left hemisphere, and therefore requires a lot of effort to articulate, as I know, because I've articulated it at very great lengths in those two books.

33:13.000 --> 33:27.000
And a lot of people write to me and say, I mean countless people write to me and say, thank goodness, you've explained something that kind of knew at some level, but I just had no way of working it out, expressing it or defending it.

33:27.000 --> 33:36.000
And so I think what happens is that you have to make decisions, and the worst thing that can happen to you nowadays is to be said to be inconsistent.

33:36.000 --> 33:43.000
In fact, there's a great deal of wisdom in sometimes being inconsistent, because it's usually more than one side to a question.

33:43.000 --> 33:47.000
In fact, if only we realized that there's always more than one side to a question.

33:47.000 --> 33:57.000
We wouldn't have all the ridiculous self-righteousness, foot stamping, hysterical fit on the internet when somebody says something that somebody else doesn't agree with.

33:57.000 --> 34:01.000
Well, get real, get educated, this is what life is like.

34:01.000 --> 34:13.000
And so there's a kind of idiocy and ignorance that is spread across mass culture, which encourages black and white thinking, the loss of all the nuances.

34:13.000 --> 34:19.000
And in the process, all the subtle stuff is drowned out by sound bites.

34:19.000 --> 34:29.000
And I could say something which, if taken in context, meant almost exactly the opposite of what it would seem to be saying if it was just a sound bite taken out of its contact.

34:29.000 --> 34:37.000
And so incredible injustice is done to many people by something being taken out of context and whizzed around the world.

34:37.000 --> 34:44.000
And then next thing, they find that people are sort of treating them as a non-person.

34:44.000 --> 34:56.000
So we're involved in this process of distancing from nature and coming more and more into, well, I guess they are machine environments.

34:56.000 --> 34:59.000
They've been machines, they are somewhat machine-like.

34:59.000 --> 35:02.000
We can go back to a movie like Metropolis for its language.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.000
Wonderful.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
The whole city is a big machine.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
Yes.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
And that's 100 years ago.

35:08.000 --> 35:09.000
Yes.

35:09.000 --> 35:13.000
Now, we've advanced on a lot from there.

35:13.000 --> 35:19.000
So can we talk a bit about myth directly, I guess?

35:19.000 --> 35:30.000
Firstly, could I ask you, what are your formative mythic influences, like myths maybe that you grew up with or that are important to you?

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
That's a good one.

35:32.000 --> 35:49.000
Well, I certainly didn't have a religious upbringing, not at least until I went to secondary school, where I was fortunate to be introduced to something I thought was beautiful and resonant and deep.

35:49.000 --> 35:53.000
So what did I find?

35:53.000 --> 35:56.000
I think my father was very literalistic.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.000
Bless him.

35:57.000 --> 36:03.000
I mean, he was a good man, a very good man, but he didn't have much time for poetry or music or anything like that.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
He liked facts.

36:05.000 --> 36:09.000
And I'm in favour of facts too, a lot of them.

36:09.000 --> 36:16.000
And I've defended my point of view with them, but I think there's more to life than that.

36:16.000 --> 36:24.000
Robert Graves' The White Goddess, actually, was a book I read in my teens, and I thought it was really, really important.

36:24.000 --> 36:37.000
I also read Helen Waddell's The Wandering Scholars, which was about the flourishing of poetry, music and dance in the late Middle Ages in Europe and what this meant for the culture.

36:37.000 --> 36:42.000
And then I didn't really follow the path.

36:42.000 --> 36:50.000
To this day, I haven't read The Hobbit and I haven't read The Lord of the Rings, and it's not that I don't think, you know, I don't respect Tolkien, I do.

36:50.000 --> 36:59.000
It's just rather, as I say, I don't these days have so much time for reading, you know, mythological books.

36:59.000 --> 37:12.000
I remember when I used to go say with my grandparents, I was encouraged to, and in those days we did, as we were told, to go and lie down after lunch, which gave them a chance to have a little nap and a bit of a rest.

37:12.000 --> 37:20.000
And in my bedroom, beside my table, there was a book, The Myths of Greece.

37:20.000 --> 37:32.000
And so I familiarised myself with Greek myths early on, and they were very, they touched me deeply, along with these Celtic myths that I'd heard from Robert Graves.

37:33.000 --> 37:36.000
And so these things were very important to me.

37:36.000 --> 37:46.000
And then later, you know, as I say, well, not later, but in my teens, I began to become intrigued and exploring further the mythos of Christianity.

37:46.000 --> 37:50.000
I mean, a word I use without any implication of this being true or false.

37:50.000 --> 38:00.000
And indeed, I think that myths have a kind of truth which is greater than factual truth, which as I say was a perception of the ancient Greeks anyway.

38:00.000 --> 38:06.000
So these are the things that have really intrigued me.

38:06.000 --> 38:14.000
And I also read, I did read the C. S. Lewis Narnia books, partly because I'd read the last battle when I was at school.

38:14.000 --> 38:24.000
But then when I had children of my own, I read them the whole Narnia seven-part thing, and they were completely rapt fired.

38:24.000 --> 38:29.000
And so was I, you know, I was thinking, fuck you, this is good stuff.

38:29.000 --> 38:35.000
So those are the things that, you know, it more or less obviously have populated my imagination.

38:35.000 --> 38:45.000
I was surprised when you said that you didn't have these things until a little bit later in your life.

38:45.000 --> 38:56.000
Because now it seems, I think many people are searching for something that they find in myth, and maybe you did that searching as well.

38:56.000 --> 39:14.000
And I think one of the problems with our perception of myth, and especially maybe the Christian mythos, is the idea that's held now that if you went back 300 years, everyone fully believed in Christ or in God or in the elements of the mythos.

39:14.000 --> 39:26.000
When, in fact, I think it's always been a thing that people have searched for, and a few people have found, rather than the actual held belief of everyone.

39:26.000 --> 39:33.000
The holding of fixed belief with certainty is not part of faith. It wouldn't be faith if it was certain.

39:33.000 --> 39:37.000
Faith is a matter of fidelity, in fact, that's the root of the word.

39:37.000 --> 39:49.000
In other words, it's something that you give your loyalty to, because you think it's great and noble, and it will lead you to places of revelation, of illumination, and enlightenment.

39:49.000 --> 40:02.000
And I think there's always been this tendency to think that signing up to six impossible things before breakfast is what religion is about, but it is not at all.

40:02.000 --> 40:19.000
It's about enriching the way in which you see the entirety of the world, so that once you start to see the world with different eyes, it has meaning, it has direction and purpose, it has beauty and truth in it.

40:19.000 --> 40:28.000
And these are the things that really seem to me to be the essence of a fulfilling life. Not to have those things is to be set adrift.

40:29.000 --> 40:43.000
This is backed by scientific research, but it's also intuitively obvious that the things that give us a sense of meaning are not invented by us, but are contacted by us.

40:43.000 --> 40:58.000
We are able to perceive them, and these are things we perceive with the help of nature, with the help of an intact tradition of a society, and through religions, or at any rate through a spiritual inclination.

40:58.000 --> 41:04.000
And these things are all opposed to the machine. There's no place in them for the mechanical, the simply mechanical.

41:04.000 --> 41:25.000
The simply mechanical is far too crude, leaves almost everything that's of important out. And so while it's useful, undeniably, it's only as good as the use is to which it's put, and often we're not the wisest assessors of what's going to happen when we start using it in a certain way.

41:25.000 --> 41:39.000
And we're already finding that we've set in motion things that we cannot now easily stop. It's the story of the Sorcerer's Apprentice, you know, who knew how to utter the spell that would cause the machine to get going, but doesn't know how to stop it.

41:39.000 --> 41:53.000
And now there's a lot of people who are warning us about the way in which this is going to impinge on humanity and perhaps take, if I may put it this way, the humanity out of humanity.

41:53.000 --> 42:12.000
So I think these things are massively important. And to embrace that mythos of Christianity is not to force yourself to believe anything, but to listen, to open your heart and mind to what is expressed for me most powerfully through the arts that it has generated.

42:12.000 --> 42:33.000
And so through the quite extraordinarily beautiful music, particularly of the Renaissance, and the extraordinarily fine paintings and the very moving poetry, and these things make clear to us things that otherwise we would ignore.

42:33.000 --> 42:45.000
That's my idea in a nutshell that it's not surprising that we're highly stressed, depressed, anxious, don't know what we're doing, don't know where we're going, because we've chucked all the means towards meaning out.

42:45.000 --> 42:54.000
I just want to emphasize again, you know, lots of people say, oh yes, you need these things like you make them up. Actually, you're in a padded cell, you can't see anything.

42:54.000 --> 43:02.000
It's a horrible business and the sooner it's over, the better. But let's cheer ourselves up along the way by pretending that there's something out there.

43:02.000 --> 43:11.000
No mate, there is something out there and we're part of it, by the way. Nature is not out there. Nature is in here and I am in nature.

43:11.000 --> 43:21.000
And the divine realm is not something out there or up in the sky. It's something that's in here and I'm in it. And society is not something other than me.

43:21.000 --> 43:25.000
I am in society and society is in me. These are the ways to say.

43:25.000 --> 43:44.000
But when people try to turn to something like the Christian mythos, maybe it's fair to say that what they get first is that left-brained literal interpretation of the mythos, which is in its way dogmatic.

43:44.000 --> 43:52.000
And they're meeting that with their own left hemisphere interpretation, which is where the arguments come up from.

43:52.000 --> 44:01.000
So I don't want to give this to you because this starts to become a bit like a guru question, I guess.

44:01.000 --> 44:09.000
But how do we then reconnect with our right hemisphere? That's a too big a question, I think.

44:09.000 --> 44:26.000
But maybe just in that mythic sense, when someone is asking that question, well, the Minotaur doesn't literally exist or we don't have any historical evidence for X or Y.

44:26.000 --> 44:29.000
What is an answer to that, do you think?

44:29.000 --> 44:41.000
Well, not everything that is very real is tenable down. It's not capable of being fixed.

44:41.000 --> 44:50.000
The left hemisphere wants things that are fixed and it can fix them in language and it can fix them by tracing a course in history.

44:50.000 --> 44:57.000
But while that is a very useful idea, don't get me wrong, I don't disparage that, I use that all the time.

44:57.000 --> 45:04.000
My mind is quite wrathful, actually. But it also realizes, using reason, that reason is not everything.

45:04.000 --> 45:11.000
And Pascal himself said, reason is feeble indeed if it cannot explain that reason is not everything.

45:11.000 --> 45:25.000
And of course, for people who like scientific and mathematical proofs, Gödel's theorem actually proves that there are things that are certainly true within a certain framework but cannot be proved within that frame.

45:25.000 --> 45:35.000
So I think one needs to free oneself from the idea that one builds up a picture of reality from little nuggets that one puts together.

45:35.000 --> 45:39.000
Well, I've got a fact there and a fact there, I put them here. Of course, they don't seem to mean anything.

45:39.000 --> 45:47.000
Well, no, first of all, you've taken them out of context. They only mean something in the context that there is.

45:47.000 --> 45:54.000
And so we need that business of bringing together, but it doesn't start from the bits.

45:54.000 --> 46:00.000
It starts from the fact that things are already here and that our mind wants to break them up.

46:00.000 --> 46:08.000
So one has to think in broader patterns over greater distances in time and in space.

46:08.000 --> 46:20.000
So we are connected with others across time and space. We are as connected with our ancestors as we are with our descendants.

46:20.000 --> 46:25.000
And we have loyalties to both and duties to both.

46:25.000 --> 46:34.000
And we're also connected to people all around the world as we more and more perceive through the damage that has been done by industrialization.

46:34.000 --> 46:41.000
And so I think the first thing is to perceive the world differently.

46:41.000 --> 46:46.000
Often in a religion, people will say, and they're right.

46:46.000 --> 46:52.000
To me, say a Christian, it's not to believe the following things and never doubt them.

46:52.000 --> 46:58.000
But it is to see with new eyes, to feel with a new heart.

46:58.000 --> 47:03.000
There is a medieval prayer, which I think is very important, God be in my head.

47:03.000 --> 47:09.000
And it's very short. It's only a few lines. You know, God be in my head and in my understanding.

47:09.000 --> 47:13.000
God be in my eyes and in my looking. God be in my mouth and in my speaking.

47:13.000 --> 47:18.000
God be in my heart and in my thinking. God be at my end and at my departing.

47:18.000 --> 47:27.000
And that very neat and short poem is very much about what I was talking about, internalizing something that is bigger than you.

47:27.000 --> 47:30.000
And so the first thing is to change the cast of mind.

47:30.000 --> 47:34.000
And people might say, well, how do I do that without working from step to step?

47:34.000 --> 47:39.000
But that, again, is the left hemisphere. This is actually not the way things work.

47:39.000 --> 47:50.000
Many things come as a moment of insight, as an aha moment, a re-jigging of a shape of a form, so that you see it anew.

47:50.000 --> 48:01.000
And, boringly, as a psychiatrist, a lot of work that I have done is helping people to see for themselves what it is they need to do.

48:01.000 --> 48:08.000
And that, you know, if you make the mistake, as when I was wet behind the ears and haven't had a lot of experience in psychology,

48:08.000 --> 48:13.000
I used to do it just to tell people what they needed to do. It wasn't that I was wrong. I was right.

48:13.000 --> 48:17.000
But the thing is, it's no good telling people until they see it for themselves.

48:17.000 --> 48:22.000
And what's more, what they will see is greater than anything. I can tell them and more appropriate to them.

48:22.000 --> 48:30.000
So that's what I'd say. I mean, of course, I can become banal and say there are things to do, like practice mindfulness, which I think is very important.

48:31.000 --> 48:42.000
Practice being compassionate and grateful. These are simple things and listen more to music and attend to it.

48:42.000 --> 48:46.000
Don't just, you know, have it on in the background and not pay attention to it.

48:46.000 --> 48:54.000
So, and to read myths and re-engage really with a mythology.

48:54.000 --> 48:58.000
And the best mythologies are religious mythologies, in my view.

48:58.000 --> 49:03.000
I mean, they're the accumulation of wisdom with so many people over so long.

49:03.000 --> 49:11.000
The idea that little me can in my lifetime with a little bit that I know improve on that is hubris, isn't it?

49:11.000 --> 49:15.000
Isn't that just an extraordinary act of arrogance?

49:15.000 --> 49:22.000
So it's not to say that, you know, traditions aren't changing. They're changing all the time. They flow.

49:22.000 --> 49:29.000
But the only way in which we can make things go in the direction that we think is better is by engaging with that tradition.

49:29.000 --> 49:35.000
It's like a plug that you want to go somewhere. You don't cut it off from its stem and roots and stick it on the wall.

49:35.000 --> 49:38.000
You train it there, and that's what a tradition is like.

49:38.000 --> 49:45.000
That's very cool. I think maybe I can push on that a bit.

49:45.000 --> 49:54.000
So I think for people today, there is a great difficulty engaging with these religious traditions,

49:54.000 --> 50:03.000
which I would say are kind of the great mythos, mythoses of our civilization.

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
Yeah, mythos.

50:05.000 --> 50:12.000
So I think we're engaging instead with what you might call a synthetic mythos.

50:12.000 --> 50:20.000
And two of the great figures in that happening. One is Joseph Campbell and his hero's journey or his mono myth.

50:20.000 --> 50:29.000
So I would say it's kind of like a synthesizing. He takes all of this pattern from great mythic traditions,

50:29.000 --> 50:39.000
especially the Christian tradition, and presents it as a pattern which is then picked up by storytellers,

50:39.000 --> 50:43.000
famously Star Wars, but hundreds of other movies.

50:43.000 --> 50:50.000
And these movies seem to be consistently very powerful for people. They have a real effect.

50:50.000 --> 50:59.000
And then Campbell's ideas are really coming from Carl Jung and his ideas about archetypes and so on.

50:59.000 --> 51:07.000
So could you comment perhaps a bit on the idea of could a synthetic mythos have value in that way,

51:07.000 --> 51:17.000
and also about perhaps a relationship between Jung and your own thinking on the hemispheres and meaning of myth?

51:17.000 --> 51:27.000
Yes, there is a very strong link between my thinking and Jung, and it really wasn't from reading Jung that I generated what I think.

51:27.000 --> 51:33.000
It worked the other way that I worked from the neuroscience to see what the picture was.

51:33.000 --> 51:40.000
And it wasn't always the one that people would anticipate. And yet I found constantly resonances with Jung's work.

51:40.000 --> 51:47.000
And with Hillman, you know, James Hillman, who was a disciple, if you like, of Jung.

51:47.000 --> 51:58.000
So yes, no, I agree with this. What I found is that myths I from all around the world have similar core perceptions.

51:58.000 --> 52:09.000
At the beginning of part three of The Matter with Things, which is the section on ontology or metaphysics, whatever you like to call it.

52:09.000 --> 52:21.000
And I quote at some length a myth of the Onondaga people who are Iroquois, which I think is staggering.

52:21.000 --> 52:28.000
I mean, when I first heard it, I could not believe it. It was absolutely what I was seeing in the hemispheres.

52:28.000 --> 52:35.000
It's the story of two brothers, one of which is more insightful and better motivated than the other.

52:35.000 --> 52:44.000
But they both have divine power. And what needs to happen is that the one that is more fallible and more arrogant and more resentful,

52:44.000 --> 52:50.000
this other brother, is kept, if you like, under the aegis of the wise brother.

52:50.000 --> 52:57.000
But they shouldn't get too close together, because otherwise what the right hemisphere, the master, the better brother sees,

52:57.000 --> 53:00.000
would be initiated by what the left hemisphere contributes.

53:01.000 --> 53:07.000
And so that was a staggering one. But, you know, people don't have to espouse Christianity.

53:07.000 --> 53:14.000
I happen to think it's the richest of all the mythologies. But there's so much in Vedanta. There's so much in Taoism.

53:14.000 --> 53:23.000
I'm a Taoist. And there's no contradiction between being a Taoist and being, in my case, a very odd and probably not very good Christian.

53:23.000 --> 53:38.000
But at least these are other ways of thinking that it's so rich that it's like them is to deprive yourself of all the things that to me seem to give life its richness.

53:38.000 --> 53:47.000
So I hope people will rediscover it. And I think, although you say people are very resistant to this, I think they're resistant to the bad stuff.

53:48.000 --> 53:55.000
And particularly when they look at religions as a fundamentalist and violent and hateful, that has nothing to do with religion.

53:55.000 --> 54:02.000
Nothing. So, I mean, that's just a perversion of religion. There's a horrible exagressiveness from a religion.

54:02.000 --> 54:10.000
But they are searching for myths, but not just the sort of myth that somebody made up yesterday, really.

54:10.000 --> 54:16.000
But one that seems to reflect a deep insight into the nature of the cosmos.

54:16.000 --> 54:28.000
And sometimes this can be done in less mythical terms. I mean, I hope that what I have, if you like, I certainly don't want to go on record of saying that I think the hemisphere differences is a myth,

54:28.000 --> 54:33.000
except in the sense that this can be profoundly true in a logical way as well.

54:33.000 --> 54:41.000
But it is, if you like, a helpful myth that enables people to see why certain things go together, you know.

54:41.000 --> 54:53.000
Why, for example, would an attention to detail a failure to understand implicit meaning and a kind of insane optimism go together?

54:53.000 --> 55:01.000
I mean, they don't sound like they should. But in fact, if you know about hemisphere differences, you can see exactly why they don't.

55:01.000 --> 55:05.000
And then you can start seeing it in, I just put those three randomly together.

55:05.000 --> 55:09.000
Because after all, there are so many differences, you can find many intersections.

55:09.000 --> 55:21.000
But all I'm really saying is that the old vision of the right and left was just so wrong, and we need to really pay attention critically to what the real differences are if we're to know ourselves.

55:21.000 --> 55:30.000
And you know, the great injunction of the ancient Greek world was know thyself. It's very simple, too worse, but so profound.

55:30.000 --> 55:37.000
I think my before encountering your ideas, and they helped me to understand this much more clearly.

55:37.000 --> 55:45.000
My way into some of this was through attempting to be creative, trying to write for me.

55:45.000 --> 55:52.000
And then quite young, actually, I started teaching writing.

55:52.000 --> 55:59.000
And one of the groups of people I would work with were people who were very intelligent, usually professionals.

55:59.000 --> 56:09.000
They were now retired professionals. So they had a very highly trained intellect, and they were trying to crack this nut of being creative.

56:09.000 --> 56:27.000
And I came up with my own myth about it, which I would use with people, which is that the part of you that wants to be creative is like a crazy old hippie that has huge ideas, often about myths, actually.

56:27.000 --> 56:42.000
But in order to express it, you have to work with, you have to get the crazy old hippie to work with a kind of uptight middle manager who actually has the writing skills that are needed to do the writing.

56:42.000 --> 56:49.000
And you have to somehow get these two characters into a room together and get them working together.

56:50.000 --> 56:57.000
Which I think for me is something like the left and right hemispheres in their character.

56:57.000 --> 57:11.000
But I feel that for a lot of people, their way into this is about this creative challenge. Like you try and write, but there's this inner editor who's always there criticising everything that you write.

57:11.000 --> 57:14.000
So you never finish anything.

57:14.000 --> 57:24.000
Well, just as I said, that's been a big problem in my life. I have a very strong inner critic.

57:24.000 --> 57:32.000
But I think the only thing I'd have to do here is to dissociate myself from the idea that the right hemisphere is a crazy old hippie.

57:32.000 --> 57:41.000
The right hemisphere is the fount of wisdom, really. And it's also very down to earth, by the way, unlike many hippies.

57:41.000 --> 57:49.000
It is actually the one that is more in touch with reality and better grounded than the left, which goes off on fantasies.

57:49.000 --> 58:01.000
But what I would add to your picture is that when people want to be creative, they're wanting to be creative is something to be slightly wary of.

58:01.000 --> 58:09.000
Because it's one of those things that can't be wanted in a left hemisphere way. So what do I do? I follow the following steps.

58:09.000 --> 58:20.000
And that is not going to work any more than I want to believe, you know, really work. And you can try. It's true.

58:20.000 --> 58:30.000
But in a way, you have to open yourself up to something that you don't yet know what it is. And in order to do that, you have to still the part of your mind that is striving to achieve.

58:30.000 --> 58:41.000
This part of your mind that says, I know what it is. I know what I need. Because every time we say, I know, we close down again on the familiar that we're trying to get away from.

58:41.000 --> 58:52.000
And so a lot of time in creation passes in what appears to be unfruitful openness to things without any conclusions being drawn.

58:52.000 --> 59:05.000
But it's only in that wise silence of not saying and not doing that things will begin to reveal themselves to us.

59:05.000 --> 59:18.000
Steiner has written very well, George Steiner, on this idea of the sort of attentive mind that is hearing something. It's not quite clear yet, but it's leaning into it.

59:18.000 --> 59:32.000
And that is a very good model, which he sees actually imaged in the four paintings of the Annunciation by Fra Angelica, in which the Virgin is sort of listening to the angel.

59:32.000 --> 59:40.000
And the angel is sort of as if we're attending to the Virgin. Anyway.

59:41.000 --> 59:50.000
Yeah, and just just sitting with some of that for a moment. When you said about your own inner critic.

59:50.000 --> 59:51.000
Yes.

59:51.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Have you do you feel that in the writing of nonfiction of these two books that you have you have silenced the critic to some extent.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:15.000
I was curious when I can. The critic is usually most vocal and I'm trying to get started, which is a sort of catch 22.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:23.000
And in fact, I only was able to write the master and his emissary by pretending to myself. And I really did believe that's what I was doing.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Okay. I wrote all the main concepts about 70 of them on little lozenges of paper and I laid them all out on the floor in the living room and moved them about to see where they went and see if I could find a diagram.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:46.000
I really couldn't. So I said to myself, right, I'm no more than 25 pages, a skeleton of where you want to be going in this book.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:54.000
And I headed it up as you can, of course, in word with the header that said draft out time of the master and his emissary.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:01:06.000
And it finally reached about 1300 pages of text. And I printed it off and gave it to a friend of mine who I call my unofficial editor because he's so insightful.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:14.000
And he had a shop. I gave it to him in a shopping bag and he looked at it and he saw the title and he said, some odd lie.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:19.000
And indeed it was, but that was the way in which I sort of fooled myself into writing it.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:32.000
But another thing is that I feel that when I'm writing well, stuff comes from that place, which is not entirely forced or intended.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Stuff asks me to be written. And I sometimes thought when I looked at the master's emissary and even more when I looked at the matter with things,

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:53.000
which as you know is an even greater task in terms of the amount of scholarship and science in it.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:02:00.000
I sort of look at it and think, but how did you write that? I mean, you're a lazy person. How could you have written it?

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:09.000
So I have a conclusion that the mice wrote it in the night. The Taylor of Gloucester came down in the morning, not having enough gloss to the waistcoat.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:16.000
He had to deliver in the morning and suddenly found the mice had made it. I feel not like that.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:22.000
You see, the thing is that very little of what goes on is conscious. We have this idea that there are two tanks.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:38.000
There's a sort of nice, big, clear tank of consciousness. And underneath is a slightly murky, muddy region, which has a sort of, perhaps a sort of flip column through which you can pass from one to the other.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:42.000
But most of what goes on is in the consciousness. This is absolutely not true.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:59.000
I mean, I used to say that 95% of all our mental activity is unconscious, but a paper with rather amusing precision that I quote in the book says that 99.44% for mental activity is not conscious.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:08.000
In other words, you don't have to buy the precision to get the point that almost everything we do and not just the sort of lesser stuff goes on unconsciously.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:23.000
So we solve difficult problems in maths in our life. We project how to deal with the future to make decisions to like things, to fall in love, to not.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:30.000
All these things are going on under the radar and they're not unintelligent for that. They're using our full intelligence.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:42.000
And you found a very, for a work of very, based on a lot of very rigorous research, you found a very potent myth to communicate.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Yes.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:57.000
In the master and the master and his emissary, which I think is why it has communicated because this seems to be a very important part of communicating complex ideas to people.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.000
Yes.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:12.000
I think, for instance, like Einsteinian relativity is completely incomprehensible to most people, but the idea that you go to space and you come back and it's the future because of relativity.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:19.000
That is the myth that people can actually get onto or the trains in relation to each other.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Yes.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:25.000
What you're describing is quite a consistent story of myth makers.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Yes.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:34.000
That this comes from somewhere beyond us, from artists and creators and scientists as well.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Anyone who reaches that real insight, it seems to come from beyond us.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:49.000
So is that beyond the right hemisphere or is that simplifying too much?

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:59.000
I think that could be simplifying too much.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:05.000
The thing is we don't know, really, the depths of our knowledge because if we did, we'd be conscious of it.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:16.000
But I think that in our unconscious, we are making sense of clocking and understanding intuitively something about the way our mind and therefore our brain works.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:23.000
And for me, the best demonstration of this is this Onondaga legend, which is completely amazing.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:27.000
It's so accurate about how the train actually works.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:33.000
And it comes from an era before there were any brain imaging studies.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:38.000
So I think that's the way I put it.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:50.000
The difficulty with the myth is that people who are very, if you like, narrow in their thinking think that if he's created a thing that submits, it must be wrong.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
He's not a real scientist.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:57.000
This is rather a shame because I've really sweated blood over the science.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:03.000
And I defy anyone to show me exactly why I've got this wrong and nobody ever has.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:07.000
In fact, there's a very interesting phenomenon, which is something like this.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Scientists say, well, I love the neuroscience and no quarrel with that.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
It's very interesting and revealing.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:18.000
But then you go on and apply it to life.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
And I'm not with you there.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:24.000
And then there are other people who say, well, I don't know about the neuroscience and so on.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:30.000
But what you see in the evolution of Western culture is so right.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:33.000
You know, it just cries out.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:37.000
So you've got these two people, each of them sort of saying, yes, this bit is fine, this bit.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:41.000
They don't want a corpus callatum to put them together.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:46.000
But that's what I hope I have provided because they do need to be seen together.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:50.000
And my editor at Yale for the Master in Science, I sort of said, you know, I think there are two books here.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
We could make two books out of this.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:56.000
And she very wisely said, yeah, but the trouble is that the scientists would read one

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:00.000
and the humanities people would read the other and never the train should meet.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:05.000
And so I'm extremely glad that she insisted they should all be part of one book.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Can I ask you about the idea of the machine?

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Absolutely.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Again, because this is very powerful in science fiction.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Yes.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:18.000
We have from Frankenstein.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:22.000
So Mary Shelley's Frankenstein written in the Gothic tradition,

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.000
but it's often recognized as the first science fiction.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Yes.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:30.000
You of course have a scientist at the heart of it.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:37.000
And but then this idea that you can put together a body from spare parts.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:45.000
That if we've given up the idea of humans as some kind of divine entity, perhaps with a soul,

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
what do we say they are?

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:50.000
So we start to say that we're machines.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:58.000
And Shelley reflects on that and reflects on the kind of the horror of that possibility.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:05.000
A very famous science fiction movie like The Matrix where we're literally lost in machines

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
that control every part of our life.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:13.000
And this is something I talk with about two of my podcast listeners.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Because I'd say about 70 percent of the science fiction community.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.000
And I pull them on this.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:21.000
If I asked them would say, yes, I am a machine.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:28.000
And they might add to that that I am a biological, a biological machine.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:32.000
So this seems to be the mythos of our time.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:36.000
This is how we understand ourselves now as a machine.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:42.000
And I know that that you can can see through that or pass that for us.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:53.000
And I'd like you maybe to talk to my listeners who think that they are machines about how to have a larger picture of ourselves and that.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Well, in chapter 12 of The Matter With Things, a chapter called The Science of Life.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.000
A case of left hemisphere capture.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:11.000
What I'm arguing there is that organisms are holes that are not decomposable into their parts

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:14.000
and are not understood if viewed as machines.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:21.000
And that's not anything I say without serious scientific evidence.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:28.000
And there are a number of talks I've now done, perhaps half a dozen, with Michael Levin,

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:39.000
who is a distinguished professor at Tufts and a microbiologist and geneticist and evolutionary biologist about this.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:50.000
And I think that more and more I see people realizing that the old story that was told that we were all, you know, this sort of...

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:56.000
I'm poor at talking, but this idea that somehow, you know, we're lumbering robots controlled by our genes for their benefits.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:04.000
And that was a myth that was simply mythical in the pejorative sense.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:13.000
And that we are not machines. And we could completely miss many things and can't explain many things if we think of ourselves as that.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:19.000
I think I give at least eight ways in which we differ from machines and look over the evidence in some detail.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:23.000
So I recommend people to read it if they're interested.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:32.000
But I think there's a big problem here, which is more of a philosophical nature, that we don't understand the relationship between parts and the whole.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:36.000
And what I think is that parts are an invention.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:51.000
So what that is holds, in other words, not mechanical constructions, but non-divisible, although they have distinguishable parts,

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:55.000
but non-divisible holds that can't be reduced to that part.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:06.000
And there was a great mathematician and philosopher called Robert Rosen, who wrote a book called Life Itself,

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:16.000
and a more approachable book called Essays on Life Itself, in which he argues that whatever exists is largely better understood

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:23.000
by assimilating it to the model of an organism than that of a machine, even the inanimate world.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:29.000
And he leads to the conclusion that actually, inanimacy is something that doesn't really exist,

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:38.000
but would be the asymptotically approached reality if one pushed the mechanical idea far enough.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
But it doesn't actually exist anymore.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:44.000
And that when one starts realizing what one's dealing with is organic holds,

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:51.000
one understands their behavior and the way in which we understand them, we understand them much better.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:12:00.000
So all that exists is holds, and what we see as parts are holds at another level.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:05.000
And so there are, in a sense, a nesting of holds in the cosmos.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:13.000
And different holds are appropriate at different levels of magnification, if you like, to talk in those terms.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:22.000
So that's some of what I'd say, but I could quote some fascinating things that suggest that we're not.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Barbara Matintock, who won a Nobel Prize for her work in microbiology,

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:37.000
was able to show that microorganisms, bacteria, and single cells were able to respond in an imaginative way to a crisis

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:42.000
that they were never programmed to tackle and had never experienced before.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:47.000
But they came up with a solution nonetheless, and that requires a certain kind of intelligence.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Whatever you like to say, it might not be intelligence like yours or mine, but it's some kind of an intelligence.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:56.000
And there are many other instances throughout the natural world,

01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:01.000
that plants that make decisions that they simply can't possibly have been prepared for

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:06.000
in strange situations set up in the laboratory, probably haven't got time to explain them here,

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:09.000
but they are ripping and amazing.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:15.000
So we know that all that lives, and probably all the things that we don't think live,

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:18.000
behave in ways that we haven't completely fathomed.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:26.000
And as you go further and further into the ultramicroscopic world of particle physics and so on,

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:30.000
you realize that once again the idea of a mechanism doesn't work.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:37.000
So the way I look at it is the idea of a mechanism is a kind of shoddy model

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:42.000
that works okay for practical purposes in the middle of something,

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:45.000
but it doesn't work at all when you go small or go big,

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:49.000
and it doesn't work at all when you go in rather than out.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:55.000
So as I sometimes say, if I were building a garage, I don't need to take into account the curvature of the world,

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
but that doesn't mean the world is flat.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:02.000
The world is curved, and it's spherical, and that's really important to note.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:07.000
But for certain purposes one can ignore reality, and the left hemisphere's model is not real.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:12.000
It's a model, exactly that, and a machine is simply a model.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:16.000
It's a way in which we have modeled things in order to be able to manipulate the world better.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:23.000
And for those purposes they work, but a mistake is to think that because we've made something that works,

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:29.000
we understand the things of which it is only a remote cousin,

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:33.000
or not even that because it doesn't belong to the same family at all.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Could we almost argue then that there aren't any machines?

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:45.000
A machine is when we impose this map onto something which is actually a set of holes,

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:51.000
and we see it as a machine because we're going to use it for a certain purpose.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:58.000
Yes, all the ways in which we understand things are models, and we improve the model or we don't.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:06.000
And I think the model of the machine, yes, it works very well every day for making stuff to help us manipulate.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:14.000
But it's not truthful, it's just a model, not a very good one, not a very sophisticated one, but it's fine.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:20.000
And the proof of the pudding is that it has made us powerful, alas, without improving our wisdom.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:26.000
And I would say we're probably the least wise people that have ever inhabited the earth, and yet we're also the most powerful.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:32.000
This is a dangerous combination.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:39.000
And we tell this story in myth over and over again that our machines are very powerful, but they're not wise.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:49.000
And they're unable to wield meaningful, to create meaningful things in the world.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:52.000
They will strip meaning out of everything.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:57.000
But it seems very, I just want to push on it a little bit further.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:05.000
It seems very, very, very sad that so many people see ourselves.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:12.000
So certainly, probably up until my mid-twenties, I would have agreed with that assertion that I am a machine.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:18.000
And I feel sad about that in retrospect for what I may have thought about myself.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:27.000
And I think it was also accompanied with a lot of other thoughts, a certain despair, if the world is just a big machine.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Where is the meaning in any of this for me?

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:40.000
Well, yes, and you referred to images coming from the early 20th century.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:47.000
And one that you probably know is the machine stops a short story by Am Forster, which is amazing.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:54.000
He saw already in 1912, whenever he wrote it, that we were going to be ending up basically living in a machine depending on it,

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
and not really understanding what lay outside it.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
So it is a worry.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:04.000
But, you know, can a machine bleed?

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:07.000
To quote Bertrand de Venis.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:10.000
Can a machine sorrow?

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
Can it fall in love?

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
Can it change its mind?

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:17.000
Can it truly imagine?

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:22.000
In what ways is a machine like us?

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:30.000
All that we do in AI is to project outwards a bloodless, abstracted way of thinking.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:40.000
Turning something that is something we should be trying to get beyond, not enlarged.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:49.000
And it is the means whereby the left hemisphere's thinking is pushed outwards into the world.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:57.000
You see, because the left hemisphere loves the theory, it prefers anything that fits with the theory and doesn't see anything that doesn't fit with its theory.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:04.000
So once you've decided that people are machines, for example, just to take an example, then you don't see all the evidence of things that don't fit with them.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:08.000
Because the left hemisphere wants consistency with its model.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:13.000
The right hemisphere is what V.S. Ramachandran, a very great neuroscientist, called the devil's advocate.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:16.000
In other words, it says, yeah, but hang on, it might not be like that.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:23.000
That says it's a really important element to have in one's armory.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:30.000
And the right hemisphere's way of approaching things is, okay, you say this in theory.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Let's now test it against reality.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:41.000
Now, that's great, but the difficulty is that the left hemisphere has colonized external reality.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:47.000
So for many people, when they look outwards into the world, they see a screen, they see a machine, they see...

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:56.000
All around them, they see a bringing into being of this mechanical, utilitarian world, which is the left hemisphere's world.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:02.000
And in recent years, it has pushed forward in two very damaging ways.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:13.000
One is a colossal growth, like a cancer of administration, so that now all the institutions that look after us and look after our future,

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:24.000
the universities, the schools, the hospitals are top-heavy with departments of management that try to tell teachers and doctors and lecturers

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:28.000
what they should say and what they should do and who they should hire.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:31.000
And this is a very bad state of affairs.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:37.000
It's an expression outwards of left hemisphere procedural thinking, and the other is AI.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:42.000
And now so much of time is wasted for all of us by machines.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:47.000
So something that ten years ago would have taken a five-minute phone call to somebody in the office who said,

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
I see what's going on, don't worry, I can sort that.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:54.000
But now I spend literally half a day on the internet, and instead of being able to speak to somebody, it says,

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
you know, we can help you.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:01.000
I frequently ask questions, but the frequently asked questions are never the ones I'm really asking,

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:04.000
because they're too generic and I've got a typical problem here.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:09.000
And, you know, there are boxes you have to check and things you have to go through to get there,

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:13.000
and I can't because nothing is truthful in response to them.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
So this is a huge waste of time.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:21.000
And you might, I don't know if I've got time just very briefly to refer to an amusing episode in recent history

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:26.000
when I gave a lecture for Oxford University and much of my amazement was paid for it.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
It's delightful, it's rather handsomely paid for it.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:33.000
And in the old days what would have happened is that the finance department called the University Chess

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:36.000
would have sent me a check in the post and I'd have cashed it.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:41.000
But no, now lots of things have to be done through a platform online.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:47.000
And not only one, but a couple of platforms, and you can only graduate to the second one once you've done the first.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:50.000
And they said, don't worry, we've got someone who will guide you through this.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:54.000
Three months into this process, not having got onto the second platform,

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:57.000
the person moved on to another job.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
They said, don't worry, somebody else is coming.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:04.000
Six months into this process, this other person and I had not been able to solve the problem.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:07.000
And eventually I thought, what the hell is going on here?

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:10.000
Because it asked me to tick a box, and there were 77 boxes,

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:14.000
representing what I could have provided as a service to university.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:18.000
And I could have provided window cleaning, I could have provided catering.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:24.000
But there wasn't one for giving a lecture, which seems to me a rather fundamental part of the life of a university.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:28.000
So I rang up and amazingly got a person, that won't happen in a few years' time.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:33.000
And I said, this is hopeless, and he said, oh, tell me about it, it's the bane of our lives.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:38.000
It's ridiculous. It doesn't correspond with reality, it gives us so much extra work.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:41.000
Well, this is, of course, what's happening for all of us.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:45.000
And so she said, I said, well, what do I do? Because I'm completely stuck, I can't move on.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:48.000
I said, just tick any box and we'll pay you. So I tick window cleaning.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:51.000
And they paid me, which is lovely.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:57.000
And I justified it to myself by saying, metaphysically, I was cleaning their windows.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:09.000
Well, they're the same thing, I guess, aren't they? The administration, the bureaucracy and the AI.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.000
Exactly.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:16.000
Because the only thing actually the AI will be able to do is perpetuate bureaucracy.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Perpetuate, which is already underway, yeah.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:35.000
And what you said in there to pluck this out is that what the left hemisphere theorizes or models is less and less like reality.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:36.000
Yes.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:37.000
And more and more like a machine.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:38.000
Yes.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:49.000
And what we are doing is actually going further and further from a reality that we can't touch anymore

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:54.000
because we're in the mentality of the machine, we built the machines around us

01:22:54.000 --> 01:23:04.000
and the machine is all of this idea about the world that the left hemisphere prefers to reality.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:07.000
That's exactly right.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:15.000
And what's interesting is that the, and I've come to see the importance of this more and more,

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:21.000
is that the left hemisphere doesn't really recognize anything it itself has not made.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:25.000
So the right hemisphere is interested in what actually exists,

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:30.000
but the left hemisphere is interested in things that conform to the model of things it has made.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:35.000
And so unless it has already got this idea, because remember it likes the familiar, the things that fit,

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:41.000
it doesn't like anything that disturbs that, anything that isn't made by it becomes target.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:50.000
It believes that at the moment we see the war being waged on nature and on life by the left hemisphere world

01:23:50.000 --> 01:24:00.000
and the things that don't fit with the narrative are being ignored, ostracized and dismissed, destroyed.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:10.000
And the more and more of what we will get is the, quote, wisdom of some chat GBT with steroid on steroid,

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:16.000
which basically does a survey of the internet and comes up with stuff which has already been put there

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:22.000
largely by people who have been consulting chat GBT and no doubt its descendants in due course.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:27.000
So what we're getting is a self-referential loop that it will be impossible eventually to break out of,

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:32.000
because anything other than that will be called untrue or pseudo-science or whatever.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:35.000
We desperately need to get back to truth.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:42.000
In Oxford on the 9th of February, I'm giving a talk to the university on truth

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:49.000
and why the university is becoming less and less relevant because it is turning away from the pursuit of truth.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:56.000
Yeah, wow. Ian, I've had you for about an hour and 20 minutes of recording.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:59.000
I'd love to carry on for a little bit longer as long as you're happy to.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
Yes, I am, yes.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:04.000
Okay, wonderful.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:20.000
Let me go a bit, make a speculation here then, which I've had in response to your thinking quite a few times that

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:33.000
on the direction of myth and so we were talking about truth there, truth and reality basically.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:36.000
So I'll put it on the table just as a statement.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:47.000
We've said that as well, you made the point that myths tend to express these related world views or ideas.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:52.000
There's a certain consistency across all of our myth way.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:26:08.000
One I think is like the presence of some kind of higher being or a higher consciousness be it like gods or angels or davers in Hindu mythology.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:19.000
Another we might point to is maybe a kind of other and other realm-ness which we speculate on in mythology.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:33.000
So I want to ask, is it possible that the way that the right hemisphere sees the world is what it shows us then in the myths that it tells us?

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:41.000
Is this mythic reality that we've pushed so far away closer to a truth about our reality?

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:49.000
I would certainly say that.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:56.000
It would be illogical for us to suppose that we knew everything or could understand everything.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:06.000
I mean, if a mouse could think and speak as we do, it would say, well, there's nothing beyond what I know, but we know there is.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:12.000
And there may be creatures in future or elsewhere that know more than we do.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:16.000
But that knowledge exists whether we know it or not, if you like.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:19.000
There is something there beyond what we can grasp.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:25.000
It would be an extraordinary act of blind arrogance really to suggest, no, we know it all.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
We understand it all.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:43.000
There are deep intuitions and elements of experience that suggest that there is more to this cosmos than we know the full story of.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:46.000
It's not a very extravagant claim actually.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:56.000
And the right hemisphere is able to put us in touch with that better than the left, because the left only understands what it's grasped as things it could make or has made.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:02.000
So its world is populated by its own conceptions, but the trouble is that its own conceptions are too narrow.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:10.000
And the way to break out of this is by engaging the not fanciful right hemisphere, but the imaginative right hemisphere,

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:17.000
which is able to see into things deep into them in a way that the left hemisphere cannot.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:20.000
So I do believe that, yes.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:32.000
And I think the notion that there is a cosmos out there and greater than us is a great relief in a way,

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:41.000
because you then can begin to open up and feel that it is not your job somehow to sort it all out or to...

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:49.000
But it is your job and this is a serious duty to respond to it, to at least respond to it.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:54.000
I believe truth is a relationship. Truth is an encounter.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:29:04.000
It's not stuff just out there, and it's not just stuff I made up, but it's what comes about from my encounter with everything else.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:08.000
And obviously every other person's encounter with everything else.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:11.000
Now that doesn't mean that we just make it up.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:19.000
It means that there is a reality that it behoves us to be true to in the way that we use the word true in a belief.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:26.000
I know I'd be true to somebody that I'm loyal and when you live in that truth and in that loyalty,

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:31.000
that whatever it is then begins to grow and become part of you and you become part of it.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:36.000
So it is a generative encounter in which both parties are untouched.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:42.000
And so what we need to get away from is the idea that there is a truth as it were in a box somewhere

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:45.000
and we take a path towards it and we open the box and we've got it.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:50.000
It is in fact a journey. It will always be a journey because it's one that can never be fully completed.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:56.000
But the fact that it can never be fully completed is not a problem because the value of it is in

01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:06.000
honorably, truthfully, loyally, magnanimously, generously, kindly, following that path.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:11.000
Bearing in mind the higher values, not just those that are useful to us,

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:14.000
but things like goodness, beauty and truth.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:18.000
So this is the vision that I have.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:23.000
I can't help people for whom it means nothing, but to me it means a very great deal.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:29.000
And it also means that in a way your life is not pointless or purposeless.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:34.000
No, your purpose and point is to help grow the good things that are in the cosmos.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:38.000
It's beauty, not to bring ugliness, not to bring destruction,

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:45.000
but to bring more connection, more kindness and tolerance, more beauty, more goodness into the world.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:49.000
I mean, I'm sorry if I sound preachy, but hell, I mean, these are important messages.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:53.000
And, you know, I don't really have paid up member of any religion,

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:57.000
but that shouldn't stop me from seeing these things.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:04.000
I think that mythos precedes religion.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:05.000
Yes.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:10.000
Religion maybe is that kind of formalized dogmatic thing,

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:13.000
but mythos is trying to show us.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:14.000
I agree.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
But also it takes it further.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:20.000
So it's very difficult to engage simply with the mythos

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:23.000
without all the other things that religion begins.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:28.000
I mean, the word means a binding and it means becoming together minds who can pursue things,

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:32.000
who can share things, who can feel a relationship.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:36.000
And this is very important for human flourishing.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:43.000
And we're also very beautiful, as I was saying, works of art and rituals,

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:46.000
and indeed myths that have been generated by religion.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
So it's a two-way flow.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:51.000
When religion becomes too sclerotic, then it's a problem.

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:52.000
I agree.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:56.000
But it also does a sort of two-way dance with our mythical sense

01:31:56.000 --> 01:32:01.000
in helping us to guide that because we might have a myth of,

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:04.000
I mean, anything really in a way.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:08.000
And that could be unfortunate because, I mean,

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:12.000
most people can see the falsity of certain kinds of myths.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:16.000
For example, the myth that was perpetuated throughout most of the 20th century

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
by the Soviet Union or by Mao.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:19.000
These were mythologists.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:24.000
They were profoundly destructive, horribly cruel,

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:27.000
and attacked everything good and beautiful.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:31.000
So these are not good myths.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:34.000
So we need to have in a way a bit of a touchstone.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:37.000
And that can be an internal touchstone.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:42.000
But it can also benefit from, after all,

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:46.000
the condensate of knowledge of people from days gone by

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:50.000
who were not stupid because they weren't us or didn't know things we know.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:53.000
There's lots of things they knew that we have forgotten.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
I want to push a little bit more.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:13.000
I want to be the voice of some of my podcast listeners for a second

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:19.000
who, they kind of willingly listen to me talking about myth,

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:22.000
but they don't really think science fiction is myth,

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:25.000
and they think myth is just made up.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:28.000
So now I've just put the idea on the table for them that,

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:34.000
no, actually, myth is a bit more like reality than August.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:37.000
The myth is at least necessary.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:44.000
And I think they would, at this point, actually have some anger about it.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:53.000
Because they have this perception of myth as lie,

01:33:53.000 --> 01:34:00.000
and they don't want a lie asserted as real.

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:05.000
So I just channeled them to that length there.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:08.000
So what more could we say to them?

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:14.000
Well, the first thing is to be aware when you're finding something makes you angry.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:19.000
I don't mean just in the way that a psychiatrist would say,

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:23.000
that's probably showing you a conflict in you that you're not recognizing.

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:30.000
But I mean that anger is absolutely the main mode of operation of the left hemisphere.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:33.000
It's always angry, and it's always right, by the way.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:37.000
It always knows what the truth is, thinks it does.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
But of course, you know, from my work,

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:43.000
that actually it's often frankly deluded, completely deluded,

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:47.000
but it's emphatic that what it thinks it knows is the only story.

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:52.000
Thinking you know the only story is also, I would say, a bit of an alarm bell.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:55.000
Are you really sure about that?

01:34:55.000 --> 01:35:00.000
And what about listening to a few other people and seeing if that has rings of bells?

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:09.000
The other thing I'd say is that, what about poetry?

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:14.000
Poetry takes us to places that are not just literal scientific facts,

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:18.000
but I'm prepared to say that poetry is lies.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:23.000
If so, I can't really help you, I'm just interested to know.

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:30.000
Because if you think that, you're going to miss out on an enormous amount of experience

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:35.000
that is profoundly, it speaks to us as embodying truths,

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:44.000
truths that are much harder to express in the language one might use for a dishwasher instruction manual.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:47.000
And so what are we really saying?

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:57.000
It was only with Locke in the 18th century that people started to talk about myths and poetry and so on as lies.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:02.000
And one has to be very careful about that,

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:09.000
because there are things that can be believed as unshakably true

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:15.000
because we've proved them according to what we know, which we now know are not true.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:21.000
So until Rutherford, we thought that the universe really obeyed Newtonian mechanics,

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:27.000
but there's ample evidence over the last 100 years that this is simply not the case.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:31.000
And we're now seeing, as I say in biology, that there's evidence,

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:36.000
that there are whatever you like to call them, form fields or whatever,

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:41.000
that guide the development of an organism that are nowhere to be found in the genome.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:44.000
We believed it was all in the genome, then we sequenced the genome,

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:50.000
and we found there wasn't, not only was there wasn't enough information, but there was hardly any.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:53.000
And it was so small the amount of information.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:37:00.000
It was many orders of magnitude, too little, to express what it is that organisms can do.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:05.000
So we're now opening our minds again and thinking, well, maybe there's something else going on here.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:09.000
Think about that. You come to different conclusions.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:15.000
And I think it's worth mentioning that almost all the physicists of the 20th century,

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:21.000
the great ones who one thinks of was having developed quantum mechanics,

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:28.000
people like Niels Bohr, Max Planck, Heisenberg, Schwerdinger, and so on.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:34.000
I don't need to go through the panoply, but practically all of them had a great deal of time

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:37.000
for religious myths.

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:42.000
And in fact, there is, I quote in the book,

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:46.000
evidence about the beliefs of Nobel Prize winners.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:49.000
The Nobel Prize has been awarded since 1900.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:55.000
So we have evidence over the last 120 years of the religious beliefs of people who won Nobel prizes.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:38:01.000
Are scientists less religious than the people who are at the top of their game in the humanities?

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:09.000
No. In the humanities, the rate of people who at some point in their life have been disbelievers in the divine

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:14.000
is about 35%. It's still not a majority, but it's pretty large.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:19.000
And as you go down into the sciences, it's something like,

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:25.000
it's something like 89% for biology, about 7% for chemistry,

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:30.000
and it's 4.9, 4.7% for physicists.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:35.000
They are the most religious people. And it's also the hardest science, frankly.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:44.000
So I just ask all these people who just know they're right and get very angry when someone says something they don't agree with,

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:49.000
to, you know, calm down, take a deep breath,

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:56.000
consider that you might not know everything, that the things you believe are right might only temporarily seem to be right,

01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:02.000
and are just a stepping stone on reaching greater truth, greater wisdom.

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:08.000
That's all I can say. The great thing as a psychiatrist is that you know there are people who can't help.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:14.000
And say, you stop banging your head against, you know, I'm never going to win this person over.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:20.000
So you stop worrying about it. There are always going to be people who don't see what it is you're talking about.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:26.000
Everybody has to sit with the truth as they know, and the consequences of that.

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:32.000
So good luck, you know, if you're one of the angry young men or angry old men.

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
There we go.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:42.000
Well, I think it's something we've lost in our teaching, because we're not allowed to offend students.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:49.000
It's that you can't really teach anything without pushing people to the point of anger,

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:52.000
because it's part of our development.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:59.000
Can I put one more big question on the table for you before we wrap up, which is the future.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:07.000
So obviously the future is a big part of science fiction, and I think that's because the future has become very important to us.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:13.000
We don't have another world to think about, so we think about the future of this world.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:21.000
And you mentioned actually Stalin and Mao, I think, just now.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:28.000
So that was one kind of utopian vision of the future, maybe a future with no injustice,

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:33.000
assuming we give them the credit that they actually believed what they were saying.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:40.000
So we have that utopian future, but the most powerful future seems to be progress.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:48.000
The future will have progressed, primarily technologically will have better technology.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:53.000
But none of these seem to be particularly compelling futures for us at the moment.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:41:02.000
We think more actually about Armageddon and dystopia and the destruction of the world, maybe via climate change.

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:17.000
So I wonder if you have thoughts on the future and maybe a big question about maybe what might a more hemispherically balanced future look like?

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:21.000
What might a more right hemisphere future look like, perhaps?

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:30.000
Well, of course, the talking of myths, the myth of progress is a very singular idea.

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:35.000
I mean, it was never espoused before by any other culture, but it's become ours since Enlightenment,

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:40.000
which was a very valuable but also a futuristic movement that believed that it knew everything

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:46.000
and understood everything and that the future would be ever more wonderful.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:53.000
I read a wonderful German haiku the other day, which basically translated goes,

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:57.000
in the past it was good, then everything became much better.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
If only it were good again.

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:10.000
Anyway, I think predicting the future is famously a mug's game, so I don't know.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:15.000
But I think it's very wise of us to think about the consequences of our actions.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:26.000
And I take that the cautionary principle has a great deal in it and that there are certain steps you can take that will be extremely hard to reverse.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:34.000
And we've talked a bit about that already, how a cage that's made out of self-referring loops will be very difficult to break out of.

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:38.000
So I do worry about that, and I think it's the way we're going.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:51.000
And it's certainly the case that the greatest crimes in the history of humanity in terms of their scope and severity have been conducted by people who thought they knew how to make a better world.

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:57.000
So we have Lenin and Stalin and Mao and Paul Parton and so on.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:10.000
People who are a little bit more humble and want to work with people to make them to change their understanding of other people, to be more tolerant of other people, not less tolerant of them, would be important.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:18.000
So I think what I would say is there's a more hemisphere balance future, would be a beautiful place to live.

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:31.000
It would be one where, yes, science made progress, but it wasn't trampled by, as we now know, that science is being trampled by a form of political correctness and wokeness.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:37.000
There are certain things that are true, but are known to be true, but can't be said and are dismissed.

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:45.000
And other things that, because they promote the received narrative, are not good science, but are not as published.

01:43:45.000 --> 01:44:03.000
And a recent piece of research shows that scientists, the majority, nearly all, in fact, in the words of the piece of research, scientists consulted in the US, said that they, to some extent, self-centered what it was they said or thought or investigated.

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:08.000
So it would be a world that was more in touch with truth, but also a kinder one.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:21.000
Because, you know, for all that we're trying to achieve this wonderfully balanced and lovely world, I've noticed during my lifetime a great loss of joy and peacefulness.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:38.000
You know, in the world I grew up, we know more sort of, you know, the things that trouble us now as huge problems, maybe we should have done, but in fact, there was more understanding between the sexes.

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:45.000
There was probably less anxiety between and fear between the races.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:52.000
And I know that's a difficult area to go into, because there are all kinds of points of view, and I respect that it's complicated.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:57.000
But I think it's also worth considering that we haven't necessarily made it all better.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:07.000
In fact, what we've done, whatever we have done, is produce a world which is wracked with mental illness, and in which people feel adrift and don't know what to say or what to believe.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:18.000
So I think in that world we would have returned to a sense of purpose, which was anchored around the great values of goodness, beauty and truth, and a sense of the sacred.

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:32.000
And we would begin to work together rather than work against one another, not feeding conflict and adversity, and I'm right, you're wrong, and I need power, and you must have less.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:38.000
But instead, a sort of seeing that we can work together.

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:47.000
This is so elementary that it's been part of all the people who have really helped humanity forward in the last, you know, in the 20th century.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:46:03.000
And indeed of Martin Luther King, and Nelson Mandela, I mean, we need to work together to cooperate, because if we don't, we'll die.

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
I mean, there's no question about it.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:11.000
And you know, interestingly, the story of evolution is not one of constant opposition and aggression.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:12.000
That comes into it.

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
It's a very important part of the picture.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:20.000
But actually, the species that have been most successful have been those who learned to cooperate.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:25.000
So cooperation is a big part of becoming whatever we are.

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:37.000
And I would say that if we could adopt a little more humility about what we know, faced with an insight into actually how little we understand.

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:49.000
If we could rediscover compassion and the art of gently listening to people in a non-patronizing way, but being able to discuss whatever.

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
Nothing should be off limits.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:56.000
We should be able to talk about it in a reasonable way, and hear one another out.

01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:03.000
And a sense of wonder at the beautiest nature of the world, which is not just a foregone mechanism.

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:10.000
These things would ultimately alter the way in which we experience life.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:17.000
And I think that we need to be gravitating towards them as fast as we can.

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:24.000
Recovering civility, teaching children in school, how to negotiate, how to argue two sides of a question,

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:29.000
how to arbitrate between warring parties,

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:34.000
how to do something that is normally only taught to people too late in life when their marriage is on the rocks,

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:40.000
which is how to talk to another person and hear what it is they're saying.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:44.000
So, you know, in couple counseling there's a thing you do where you say,

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
no, you say what it is.

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
No, no, you'll have your moment in a minute.

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:51.000
Let him speak or let her speak.

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:54.000
And when that's finished, then the other person's allowed to reply.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:59.000
What they must do is to say back what it is they've heard the other person say.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:03.000
And very often that is so revealing as you find that there was a misconception.

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
That wasn't what they were saying at all.

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
And so there is common ground.

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:13.000
And finding that common ground is what we need.

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:17.000
So, I don't know the answer to these things.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
I can give pointers.

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
I can give hope.

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:25.000
I can say we only are asked not to solve massive problems on our own,

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:28.000
to cooperate with others towards ends we believe in,

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:32.000
and to bring integrity into our own lives.

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:37.000
And as much as possible, avoid saying things we know to be wrong.

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:45.000
Avoid furthering things that will restrict freedom and restrict the expression of beauty.

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:50.000
And re-sophisticate our idea of what good is, which comes from the heart.

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
It's not following rules.

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
It's not ticking boxes.

01:48:54.000 --> 01:49:03.000
It's about something that's in here, a disposition of the soul.

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:08.000
Well, much of that sounds like ancient wisdom.

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:11.000
And I think maybe one of the...

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:17.000
I hope, well, I've observed this already in telling people about your work,

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:21.000
and in talking with people who are already familiar with it,

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:29.000
is that this placing this understanding of the dual hemispheres

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:36.000
gives us in itself a myth, a story to understand this through.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:43.000
So, I could say to people, listen to the good.

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:46.000
But that doesn't make sense to people.

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:52.000
But I think to say, maybe we can work from our right hemisphere for a while,

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
with all of the attached meanings to that,

01:49:54.000 --> 01:50:01.000
is actually, it is in itself a way into all of the things which you're saying,

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
which we can all agree with,

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:07.000
but we don't have a central signal to discuss it through.

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:11.000
And I hope that your work is actually giving that to people.

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:14.000
Are you seeing that in...

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:18.000
Are you seeing some impact of your ideas in the world when you talk to people?

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:21.000
It's hard to judge, because, of course, to some extent,

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:27.000
the people that I encounter are going to be the people who are more open to it.

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:37.000
But I certainly do get a colossal amount of feedback that is so heartening to me,

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:42.000
because I never foresaw that by writing, I thought about an interesting topic

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
that some people would fix on and say,

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:47.000
yeah, interesting, maybe we should investigate this more.

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
I thought basically it would all be forgotten,

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:53.000
but it hasn't been and that people see the meaning that I'm trying to propagate

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
is extraordinary heartening.

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:59.000
Young people in particular are more open to this.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:07.000
The people who are a problem are the established smug intellectuals.

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:12.000
They're practically all white and they think they know what's best

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:18.000
for people of all races and people of different sexes and so on.

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:23.000
So they think they know, and the story is a played out story.

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:28.000
And what we're experiencing is a conflict between an enforced ideology

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:31.000
which sees people in system and what our heart is telling us.

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
And that's a very uncomfortable place to be.

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:36.000
And I think that's what's causing a lot of the grief,

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:41.000
the fear, the panic, the anxiety, the stress and the gloom.

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:47.000
If we could find a world in which people spoke recognizable truths to us again,

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
this would be wonderful.

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:53.000
Because one's heart sings when one hears something that one can respond to

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:56.000
and that one knows in one's heart is right.

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
I mean, you say people don't know where to go for truth,

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:04.000
but I think they kind of do because they can see the big picture with their right hemisphere

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:08.000
and they can see the way in which this is being discussed and unpacked

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:15.000
and they can see in it something different from what it is they're being served up all the time

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
and worrying about.

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:21.000
I am in that sense a hopeful pessimist, as I often say.

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:24.000
I'm hopeful in the sense that I always have great hope in humanity.

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:27.000
You don't know what they'll come up with. They're amazingly resourceful.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
They're wonderful beings, actually.

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:34.000
One of the things I'm very opposed to is the constant derogation of humanity.

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
Yes, of course, we've made an almighty cock up.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
That's absolutely true.

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:42.000
And there's lots of things we've done that we would now not do in that way.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:45.000
But there is something amazing about human beings.

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:48.000
If we can live in harmony with the rest of the natural world,

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
there's no reason why we shouldn't.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:55.000
In fact, that's what we need to be encouraging ourselves to do.

01:52:55.000 --> 01:53:01.000
So yes, I am hopeful, very hopeful, of what will come forth.

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:08.000
It will come forth from young people because young people are not less indoctrinated.

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:12.000
You know, Max Planck famously said science moves forward a funeral at a time.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:17.000
It's not that you convince the oldies who've held the power that you've got something to say.

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
It's the young people who say it.

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
And there are lots of researchers now who write to me,

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:24.000
where can I go where I can research your things and so on?

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:27.000
I'm not really sure, but anywhere that's got an open enough mind,

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:32.000
you've got to be able to find people who will welcome you in their midst.

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:40.000
I have a feeling much more is going to form around your world in the next few years.

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
I certainly hope so.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:46.000
Can I thank you for joining me and also thank you for your work,

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:50.000
which has had a big influence on me over the last few years.

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
Thanks for having me along.

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:57.000
I've thoroughly enjoyed talking and I'm very glad that my work resonates with you

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
and means something to you.

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:03.000
As I am to so many people who please carry on writing,

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
don't feel I've heard it too many times.

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:08.000
I can never hear it enough that people write and tell me.

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
Very good. Thank you.
