0	7000	But when you mistake a map for the world, you've made a huge error, and I believe that's where we now are.
7000	14000	These seem to be the primary paths to reality. One is science, another is reason.
14000	23000	A third is imagination, and a force is intuition. And we live in an era in which imagination and intuition have been sort of tarnished as false.
23000	27000	Hello and welcome to the Science Fiction podcast with Daniel Walter.
27000	36000	Long-term listeners to the podcast will have followed our evolving journey in what we're talking about when we talk about science fiction.
36000	45000	So sometimes the Science Fiction podcast is a fancast for Denis Villeneuve and his upcoming June 2 movie.
45000	54000	But we're also trying to discuss the what happens when science and fiction meet.
54000	63000	These apparently very two opposite things, science, which is all about the facts and realities of our world and fiction, which is all about the stories.
63000	70000	And we've encapsulated this in our logo with a series of words that represent something of a duality.
70000	80000	So science and fiction, reality and fantasy, reason and emotion and mythos and logos.
80000	92000	And I'm incredibly honored today to be joined by, I think, the leading thinker in the world about this apparent division that runs through our culture
92000	103000	and seems to run through humanity. And it seems to run really down the center of our brain and the two hemispheres of our brain.
103000	108000	So I'm really happy to welcome Ian McGillchrist. Hello and welcome, Ian.
108000	110000	Oh, thank you, Damon. I'm delighted to be here.
110000	113000	Well, thank you for joining me. It is literally a tremendous honor.
113000	124000	I've spent dozens and dozens of hours listening to you on other people's podcasts and to your audio explorations of your most recent book as well.
124000	132000	I wonder if I can ask you, I hope this isn't a left field question for you, and it would be totally okay to say no.
132000	139000	But do you have any relationship to science fiction? Would you say you're a science fiction fan?
139000	146000	Some people really dislike science fiction, and if that was you, that would be fine as well. That would be an interesting direction.
146000	151000	No, I mean, I certainly don't dislike science fiction. I don't know a lot of science fiction.
151000	167000	And one of the sad things about the last 30 years is that I've had to keep up with so many science and philosophy books that I haven't really had much time for reading things that are sort of perhaps more tangential,
167000	178000	but nonetheless important. There are some works of science fiction that I consider of colossal status, and one is Stanislas Lem's Solaris.
178000	187000	And I think that Tarkovsky's exploration of it is extraordinarily inexhaustibly deep. I've seen it many, many times.
187000	194000	I've also seen the other film called Solaris Made in America, but it was so disappointing that I don't refer to it anymore.
194000	209000	But there's that. And I've also been reading something that probably isn't science fiction exactly, which is C.S. Lewis's, he did three, a three-part trilogy.
209000	222000	And I've only read the third part, which is called that hideous strength. And it is a kind of science fiction, but it's also very much a sort of mythology, and it's very powerful.
222000	230000	And very prescient, by the way. I mean, in 1945 or whenever he was writing it, he was foreseeing things that have happened recently.
230000	239000	Fantastic. That was one of my introductions to science fiction. And yes, I would definitely say that Lewis's space trilogy is science fiction.
239000	240000	Yes.
240000	255000	And also, of course, theological as well. And as always, definitely creating a myth for the future, which is one of the ways that I discuss science fiction.
255000	258000	I talk about science fiction as modern mythmaking.
258000	259000	Yes.
259000	272000	So Tolkien is, I mean, generally considered a fantasy writer, but fantasy and science fiction are very related. And he had his ideas of myth appear, the creation of myths for the world.
272000	281000	No, I was hoping that we would explore some of this overlap with myth and science fiction between us today.
281000	299000	Absolutely. Yes. Yes. Well, as you know, because you've read my work, mythos in the ancient Greek was prior to and more important than logos from which we derive the word logic.
299000	309000	I mean, logos didn't mean logic in those days. It meant things that were more explicit. It meant things that you could argue for in a court of law or, you know, in a debate.
309000	327000	But mythos was the only way of capturing the really serious, important, emotional, philosophical thoughts about the world that are hard to put into everyday language, but are nonetheless important for that.
327000	342000	And we seem to live in a time where for a long time, especially in Western culture, we seem to maybe deny mythos to say it wasn't significant to us anymore.
342000	348000	We could be a culture purely of logos. And I know we're going to get more into this with your ideas.
348000	359000	But then I see the way that our attempt to do that was completely futile because the mythos is really more powerful than we are.
359000	369000	And it just exploded up again. And one major way of that happening was science fiction and the huge popularity of, of course, things like Star Wars and Star Trek.
370000	379000	But movies like 2001, and of course the popularity of writers like, like Lewis, who make this explicitly theological as well.
379000	388000	Yes, yes. Your expression, it's bigger than we are, is rather important, I think.
388000	396000	There's a sense in which these things are not made up, but are permitted by us to come to expression.
396000	407000	And when one is writing the most difficult to express things, and then suddenly poetry, of which I have a little experienced,
407000	418000	one feels that something is writing through you. It's not that it doesn't use you and take part of you into it, but it's not just coming out of view.
418000	426000	That's the very strong feeling one has. And so many artists and writers have reported very much the same phenomenon.
426000	434000	Yeah, absolutely. That was, I think we'll get to that in one of my questions. I don't want to pre-empt too much here.
434000	445000	What I'd like to do for my listeners is discuss your work for which you're best known, which is articulated in two books.
445000	455000	The Master and His Emissary in 2009, and The Matter with Things in 2021. Both very significant books.
455000	468000	I think I cropped up a couple of times in your live events as the person who said that The Matter with Things is a three and a half pencil book to get through it
468000	478000	and deal with all of the questions that come up. And the complete works of Shakespeare is only two and a half pencils.
478000	494000	But would it be fair to say that The Master and His Emissary is your thesis of the dual hemispheric model, and then The Matter with Things is the extended philosophy?
494000	508000	I think that's a good way of putting it. The only thing I would add to that is that I explored literature that wasn't available when I first was writing The Master and His Emissary.
508000	522000	And so in The Matter with Things, I include a great deal more neuro-psychological evidence. I think it's about 6,000 papers and sources that are referred to there.
522000	528000	So nobody can say there's no evidence. That doesn't stop some people saying that without having looked at my books.
528000	538000	I'm trying to get beyond that. So yes, it is. And it's saying what the philosophical encourt of all this is.
538000	548000	In a second, I'm going to ask you to give your summary, I guess, which you must be very used to doing by now.
548000	561000	I think one of the important points is that this does have these very deep roots in scientific research in various areas that you have crossed into.
561000	574000	So that separates it from the pop culture idea of hemispheres, which people are quite familiar with, and then have also heard it is no longer valid.
574000	592000	So that's something to say that this goes significantly beyond that idea. And also it has a lot of similarities to a long history of thinking about the world that we might think of through the mythos or even through religions.
593000	609000	And perhaps even ideas today, like you've talked to people about John the Vakie, about meaning and so on. It crosses into all of these areas, but yours seems to be the most scientifically rigorous of them.
609000	611000	Is that fair, do you think?
611000	627000	I think so, yes. And it's not only that I take up this unpopular issue of hemisphere difference, but I come to quite different conclusions from the ones that made their way into popular culture.
627000	635000	So the first hurdle I always have to get over is, oh, all that stuff about hemispheres was exploded long ago. It's pop science and it's nonsense.
635000	648000	Well, it's true that most of, not all, but most of what was said about hemisphere differences was wrong. But perhaps I could explain what I think is important about the difference.
648000	650000	Please do.
650000	660000	First of all, it's a very evolutionarily verifiable hypothesis, if you like.
660000	676000	The idea is that the two hemispheres of the brain evolved differently, not just in human beings, but in pretty much all creatures we've looked at, to solve a particular problem, which is how to pay two kinds of attention to the world at the same time.
676000	686000	One kind of attention is required for survival in the simplest sense, that we need to get stuff, we need to grab food, we need to catch a rabbit, we need to pick up a seed, whatever it is.
686000	694000	And we need also to be able to manipulate our environment to pick things up and build things and use tools and so on in the case of human beings.
694000	709000	So, in fact, as far back as we can go in history, 700 million years, we know that the neural networks that formed the ancestors of the human brain were asymmetrical, which is interesting in itself.
709000	711000	Why were they asymmetrical?
712000	725000	And I think the reason for this was that, as I say, two kinds of attention need to be paid. One is the one with which we grab things, and so this is the one subtended by us, in us, by the left hemisphere.
725000	740000	And it therefore pays attention to something that we already know what it is, we know we want it, and we need to get it, and so it focuses in a targeted way, a very narrow beam of attention that brings clarity.
740000	746000	But the difficulty with this is that it is not seeing everything else that's going on at the same time.
746000	758000	And so in order to survive, you also need to be looking out for predators, not just predators, but also for your kin, for your offspring, for your mate, for your kind.
758000	778000	And to do this, you need precisely the opposite kind of attention, maximally open, undedicated yet as to what it may find, and broad, sustained, and on the lookout vigilant.
778000	786000	So, very different from this, I know what it is, I want to get it, it's a detail. The right hemisphere is looking out for the whole of the rest of it.
786000	801000	So, the one thing that was probably true about what people used to say was that the left hemisphere had a narrow attention and the right hemisphere broad attention, and that's not disputed by anyone in the world, and it's a very well-attested fact.
801000	814000	But what people were not aware of so much was that attention creates the experiential world. What we find to be there depends on the kind of attention we pay.
814000	823000	And there are many amusing experiments that have been done in recent years showing that we're completely blind to something we don't expect to see.
824000	834000	And so, what follows for me is that these kinds of attention give rise to two different kinds of phenomenological worlds. What are they like?
834000	846000	In a nutshell, the left hemisphere sees things that are already known, familiar, fixed, isolated, fragmentary, decontextualized, and examples of a kind, a category.
846000	857000	Not unique, but oh, it's one of those. And this kind of abstracted thinking is a useful tool, but it's not very good for constructing reality.
857000	873000	The right hemisphere sees something much more complex. It sees a world in which nothing is completely, fully known, is never completely fixed, is never completely isolated, but is ultimately in connection with everything else.
873000	892000	It's flowing, it's changing, it's often implicit. The right hemisphere is much better, sorry, this is my right hemisphere, at picking up the stuff that is hard to detect with the kind of conscious mind.
893000	911000	So, small changes in expression in the face, aspects of tone of voice, irony, metaphor, the language of poetry, the language of myths, it's much better at understanding the meaning of a story, whereas the left hemisphere sees it as simply a sequence of vignettes.
911000	914000	It doesn't understand the overall import of what's going on.
914000	930000	So, those are really quite different worlds. And my thesis is that the world that we're in now has come to depend very heavily on this very simple, mechanistic, theoretical vision of the world.
930000	941000	A distinction I like to make is between presence and a representation. And a representation means literally present again after the fact, when it's actually no longer present.
941000	951000	So, the world is present in all its richness and complexity and intuitive meaning that can never be fully grasped to the right hemisphere, which is an expert at decoding it.
951000	968000	And the left hemisphere instead replaces reality with its own simple map of reality. Now, a map is not to be despised, a map is very useful, but when you mistake a map for the world, you've made a huge error, and I believe that's where we now are.
968000	982000	I'd just like to add that in the ways in which we can come to a sense of what we can rely on, we need to be using, I would say, at least four things. These seem to be the primary paths to reality.
982000	994000	One is science. Another is reason. A third is imagination and a force is intuition. And we live in an era in which imagination and intuition have been sort of tarnished as false.
995000	1003000	But actually science and reason can lead you to false conclusions unless they are sophisticated by imagination and intuition.
1003000	1014000	And indeed, when you come to look at, as I have done, the stories of many great findings by mathematicians and scientists, they made these discoveries not by pursuing the scientific method as such,
1014000	1025000	but by having a broad attention which saw new shapes, new forms, new, as the Germans say, gestalten, which are holes that cannot be decomposed into their parts without loss.
1025000	1034000	And in each of these paths, science, reason, intuition and imagination, the right hemisphere pays the bigger part. It is actually more intelligent.
1034000	1041000	It sees more. It's emotional and social intelligence. You will not be surprised to learn as greater, but it's cognitive intelligence.
1041000	1054000	Its IQ is higher than that of the left, which is contrary to what a lot of people think. And it's much more able to feel its way into an understanding of what it is seeing in the world around it.
1055000	1079000	But these values of imagination and intuition, I guess one way I think about it is that they give us like broad long-term outcomes and the less left hemispheric values, reason and logic seem to give us like immediate and very measurable outcomes.
1079000	1100000	And they seem, I think, the reason, for instance, among the listeners of my podcast who are often very scientifically minded, there's quite a major divide, they would say, well, we get the machines and the technology from this, what they might consider the whole process of consciousness,
1100000	1115000	but what you would call the left hemispheric. So is that why we currently value the left hemisphere more? Because it gives us the machines, it gives us the technology and those seem to represent all of our progress at the moment.
1116000	1132000	Yes, I mean it takes us a little way and I don't know how much to go into, but to concentrate on something very clear, the left hemisphere's aim is control and power.
1133000	1143000	That's why it's in service of manipulating the world and getting stuff, grabbing stuff, it controls the right hand with which for most of us we do the manipulation.
1144000	1164000	And so its resultant is to increase power and machines and technology are ways of externalizing this kind of thinking, but what I want to impress on any listener is that, and the full argument is in my books,
1165000	1182000	but the vision that the left hemisphere brings is woefully deficient, it's extraordinarily lacking in an understanding of context, which changes everything, of implicit meaning, of holes that can't be degraded into parts.
1182000	1194000	It focuses on things that are supposedly precise and builds from there as we make a machine, but actually nothing in the world except the machines we have made has this structure, nothing.
1194000	1203000	Living things certainly don't and the inanimate world also does not. It is not mechanical, it is not made in a machine-like way.
1203000	1211000	So in order to understand we need to greatly sophisticate our intelligence and our insight, and this comes from espousing both hemispheres.
1211000	1223000	And I'd just like to comment on the word reason. I make a distinction which is hard to make in English between what I call reason and what I call rationalization or rationalizing.
1223000	1233000	And in other languages, there are two different words for this, for example, in German, what I call reason is called vernonz, and what I'm calling rationalizing is called verstand.
1233000	1242000	So verstand or rationalizing is a procedural thing which you do explicitly on a paper, if this, then that, and so on and so forth. Nothing wrong with it.
1243000	1249000	But there is something that's much greater than that, which is the ability to set all this into an overall context.
1249000	1260000	And that's something that comes with leading a wise life, and it's the sort of thing that you would expect from a good judge that at the end of his or her career,
1260000	1270000	he was able to see the whole picture and understand in the round to take into account many, many factors in reaching a conclusion.
1270000	1279000	And if you do that, you are less often caught out by reality. If you purely rationalize, you make some very strange steps.
1279000	1289000	An amusing thing for me is that, I mean, a lot of time in my career, I've spent with patients with schizophrenia, of course.
1289000	1294000	And in schizophrenia, people talk about madness and they say it's the loss of reason.
1294000	1307000	But as has been pointed out by various people, including Minkowski, a very fine Polish-French philosopher and psychiatrist in the first part of the 20th century,
1307000	1320000	but also by others like G.K. Chesterton, the madman is someone who has lost everything but reason, can only rely on reason, and it leads to mad conclusions.
1320000	1329000	So the person who hears a voice and there's nobody in the room thinks, well, that's strange, it's not coming from me, so what is there in this room?
1329000	1339000	There's a socket over there in the wall. Somebody has wired into that, is beaming voices into my head. It's kind of logical, but of course it's utterly bonkers.
1340000	1352000	So we need to be careful. Intuition can, if unguided by reason, lead to falsity, but reason unguided by intuition can surely lead to falsity.
1352000	1366000	Can I lay something out for you and potentially as a mirror of this divide? Do you know Stanley Kubrick's 2001?
1366000	1371000	Yes, I do. I saw it a very long time ago and I can't remember it very well.
1371000	1386000	Of course. Well, it seems that we've been trying to find kind of a story for how to visualize our reality.
1386000	1402000	We had a great mythos, like the Christian mythos in the Western world, and then we came more and more to science and to reason maybe these lefts hemispheric values by going too far in that direction.
1403000	1419000	And then we've been trying to find like a new story to put in its place, and I think science fiction represents an attempt at that story in some ways, that we're going to build space rockets and teleporters and starships.
1419000	1435000	And this will take us off into the galaxy, into the universe, but which is this completely unconscious place, just full of dead matter and maybe some alien civilizations as well.
1435000	1446000	But then in a movie like 2001, Stanley Kubrick, if you remember, he shows you all of the spaceships and the satellites around Earth.
1446000	1452000	But then it's not via those that we actually go out into space.
1452000	1467000	He actually has the astronaut climb inside the mind of how the artificial intelligence and switch it off, and then we go on this kind of psychedelic journey into outer space.
1467000	1482000	So I'm sorry to test you with a film you only vaguely remember, but does that seem to express some of this divide between the hemispheres as an idea, just in the way that I've laid it out for you?
1482000	1498000	I think it does, but I caution about the divide because I make a distinction between division in the sense of complete separation and division in the sense of making a distinction.
1498000	1501000	And there is a distinction between these hemispheres.
1501000	1511000	One of the myths that I need to stamp on is that the left hemisphere is the hemisphere of science, and the right hemisphere is the hemisphere of sort of fantasy.
1511000	1521000	It certainly not. It is the hemisphere that's much better at imagination. But to go off on a hair, which I won't pursue unless you want me to, imagination is almost the opposite of fantasy.
1521000	1528000	Fantasy takes us away from reality. Imagination enables us to enter into reality.
1528000	1537000	But yes, I think you're right. I mean, one thing to say right away is that there is no conflict between Christianity and science.
1537000	1553000	This is something that has been drummed up only since the middle of the 19th century by people who, I suppose, looking at it most charitably, they wanted to make sure that there weren't religious constraints on what could be claimed.
1553000	1576000	And that, of course, I would back. But religion and the myth of Christianity, which is probably the most rich myth that we've ever created, if we created, is something that speaks of exactly what the best of the left and right hemisphere can bring about.
1576000	1592000	But what happens whenever you have a myth, and if you have a religious myth, is that the left hemisphere wants to codify it. It wants to create a lot of rather odd propositions that you must sign up to, and it wants to structure it in a logical way.
1592000	1601000	And so whole bodies of dogma are created by the left hemisphere, imposing this on religion, which is not the wellspring of religion.
1601000	1615000	The wellspring of religion is something that is carefully responded to by patient attention, by listening to things that you don't expect to hear, understanding the speaking to you of everything around you.
1615000	1636000	And so when, again, you talk about dead matter, and again, how long have you got? But I mean, you know, I argue in the matter with things that, in fact, consciousness is not something that sort of emerged late in the day out of a brain, but it is, in fact, a primary element, what's called an ontological primitive in the universe.
1636000	1662000	There's so much rich stuff in there in relation to this topic. There's something that I've observed, and it's quite widely observed, often among writers of science fiction, which is that the kind of the collective imagination is more and more literal in its interpretation of any story that's given to it.
1662000	1663000	Absolutely.
1663000	1683000	So for any half decent writer, if you're writing about space rockets and planets and alien civilizations, there's some level in which you're exploring kind of scientific ideas, but there's also the symbolic and the metaphoric and the mythic in there as well.
1683000	1689000	But it's harder and harder for people to think in that way at the moment.
1689000	1704000	Absolutely. And one of the most striking things for me is that the left hemisphere doesn't understand anything that is not literal. So it really doesn't understand the point of poetry. Why lie when you could say it clearly?
1704000	1720000	It doesn't understand music. It doesn't understand irony. It doesn't understand sarcasm. It doesn't understand wit or humor. And so what you find is that people take everything incredibly literally and miss the point.
1720000	1737000	So the vanishment of humor from public discourse in the recent years has been one of the most grievous losses to humanity that I can imagine, because in humor, although we think of it as just an entertaining element, it's actually a very profound element.
1737000	1758000	And it's also got its place in spiritual traditions, above all in Zen, which uses tumor to help us see things that are not logically, reductively explicit. So, yeah, I mean, this is happening everywhere.
1758000	1775000	I might say, if I may, that when I first went to America, I was working at Johns Hopkins in a neuroimaging lab. And I found that in the first few weeks, people kept looking at me, but other puzzled when I say something and they go, really?
1775000	1792000	And then I'd go, no, not really, don't mind. But I hadn't realized how much of whatever I said was to be read between the lines. It was amusing. It was putting a perspective on something. But they took everything deadly seriously.
1792000	1806000	And this may be an aspect of having a melting pot of cultures where you can't rely on the usual sort of things to do with the way people say thing. And so you have to deal only with the explicit. But it's now become what we have to deal with everywhere.
1806000	1808000	Sorry, carry on, please.
1808000	1822000	I had a very similar, very similar experience of doing a long writer's workshop in California. This was over a decade ago now. And I was the only English person there. And I loved everyone on the workshop.
1822000	1823000	Yes.
1823000	1837000	But I realized about two weeks into it. And I said to one of my friends that I think maybe some of the people in the group are angry with me. And my friend touched me on the knee and said, they don't, they don't realize you're being ironic.
1837000	1851000	And I fought back for everything I said. And for, oh, no, they must think I'm a, I'm a terrible, terrible person. But what, so I want to dig into a bit more of what what's driving this literalism them is.
1851000	1866000	I know this isn't what it is, but is, is the left hemisphere becoming bigger and and dominating us biologically? Or is there some kind of feedback mechanism in our culture? Or why are we becoming more and more?
1866000	1867000	Yes.
1867000	1868000	More left hemisphere?
1868000	1880000	Well, as you rightly say, it's not that the left hemisphere is getting bigger. And in fact, it's of interest that the right hemisphere is slightly bigger and heavier than the left hemisphere in humans.
1880000	1900000	What is happening, I think, is that, let me just refer here to one of my favorite philosophers, A. N. Whitehead, who said that a civilization flourishes until it starts to analyze itself.
1900000	1915000	And I think that what happens is that in the way we have mainly lived for thousands and thousands of years is in harmony with nature, in harmony with society, in harmony with the myths, the rituals, the beliefs of our culture.
1915000	1930000	And that these had been ample ways of alerting us to many kinds of truth that was not just a kind of tit for tat in the court of law way of debating things, but certain realities could not be encompassed in that way.
1930000	1932000	But they didn't need to be.
1932000	1951000	Well, what's happened in a largely deracinated culture where people have been torn away from their communities, dragged into the cities, more and more into a world made by machines, reflecting the left hemisphere as kind of a world all around them.
1951000	1968000	They look out of the window, they see mechanisms, they see hard surfaces on a rigid grid, and they are no longer in touch with what I'm honored and grateful to be in touch with here, which is being surrounded by nature.
1968000	1971000	And these things teach you, they speak to you.
1971000	1980000	And so I think what's happened is that in this world in which we rely very much on discourse, you have to choose what it is you say.
1980000	1993000	The first thing is that the right hemisphere's story is much more complex than that of the left hemisphere, and therefore requires a lot of effort to articulate, as I know, because I've articulated it at very great lengths in those two books.
1993000	2007000	And a lot of people write to me and say, I mean countless people write to me and say, thank goodness, you've explained something that kind of knew at some level, but I just had no way of working it out, expressing it or defending it.
2007000	2016000	And so I think what happens is that you have to make decisions, and the worst thing that can happen to you nowadays is to be said to be inconsistent.
2016000	2023000	In fact, there's a great deal of wisdom in sometimes being inconsistent, because it's usually more than one side to a question.
2023000	2027000	In fact, if only we realized that there's always more than one side to a question.
2027000	2037000	We wouldn't have all the ridiculous self-righteousness, foot stamping, hysterical fit on the internet when somebody says something that somebody else doesn't agree with.
2037000	2041000	Well, get real, get educated, this is what life is like.
2041000	2053000	And so there's a kind of idiocy and ignorance that is spread across mass culture, which encourages black and white thinking, the loss of all the nuances.
2053000	2059000	And in the process, all the subtle stuff is drowned out by sound bites.
2059000	2069000	And I could say something which, if taken in context, meant almost exactly the opposite of what it would seem to be saying if it was just a sound bite taken out of its contact.
2069000	2077000	And so incredible injustice is done to many people by something being taken out of context and whizzed around the world.
2077000	2084000	And then next thing, they find that people are sort of treating them as a non-person.
2084000	2096000	So we're involved in this process of distancing from nature and coming more and more into, well, I guess they are machine environments.
2096000	2099000	They've been machines, they are somewhat machine-like.
2099000	2102000	We can go back to a movie like Metropolis for its language.
2102000	2103000	Wonderful.
2103000	2105000	The whole city is a big machine.
2105000	2106000	Yes.
2106000	2108000	And that's 100 years ago.
2108000	2109000	Yes.
2109000	2113000	Now, we've advanced on a lot from there.
2113000	2119000	So can we talk a bit about myth directly, I guess?
2119000	2130000	Firstly, could I ask you, what are your formative mythic influences, like myths maybe that you grew up with or that are important to you?
2130000	2132000	That's a good one.
2132000	2149000	Well, I certainly didn't have a religious upbringing, not at least until I went to secondary school, where I was fortunate to be introduced to something I thought was beautiful and resonant and deep.
2149000	2153000	So what did I find?
2153000	2156000	I think my father was very literalistic.
2156000	2157000	Bless him.
2157000	2163000	I mean, he was a good man, a very good man, but he didn't have much time for poetry or music or anything like that.
2163000	2165000	He liked facts.
2165000	2169000	And I'm in favour of facts too, a lot of them.
2169000	2176000	And I've defended my point of view with them, but I think there's more to life than that.
2176000	2184000	Robert Graves' The White Goddess, actually, was a book I read in my teens, and I thought it was really, really important.
2184000	2197000	I also read Helen Waddell's The Wandering Scholars, which was about the flourishing of poetry, music and dance in the late Middle Ages in Europe and what this meant for the culture.
2197000	2202000	And then I didn't really follow the path.
2202000	2210000	To this day, I haven't read The Hobbit and I haven't read The Lord of the Rings, and it's not that I don't think, you know, I don't respect Tolkien, I do.
2210000	2219000	It's just rather, as I say, I don't these days have so much time for reading, you know, mythological books.
2219000	2232000	I remember when I used to go say with my grandparents, I was encouraged to, and in those days we did, as we were told, to go and lie down after lunch, which gave them a chance to have a little nap and a bit of a rest.
2232000	2240000	And in my bedroom, beside my table, there was a book, The Myths of Greece.
2240000	2252000	And so I familiarised myself with Greek myths early on, and they were very, they touched me deeply, along with these Celtic myths that I'd heard from Robert Graves.
2253000	2256000	And so these things were very important to me.
2256000	2266000	And then later, you know, as I say, well, not later, but in my teens, I began to become intrigued and exploring further the mythos of Christianity.
2266000	2270000	I mean, a word I use without any implication of this being true or false.
2270000	2280000	And indeed, I think that myths have a kind of truth which is greater than factual truth, which as I say was a perception of the ancient Greeks anyway.
2280000	2286000	So these are the things that have really intrigued me.
2286000	2294000	And I also read, I did read the C. S. Lewis Narnia books, partly because I'd read the last battle when I was at school.
2294000	2304000	But then when I had children of my own, I read them the whole Narnia seven-part thing, and they were completely rapt fired.
2304000	2309000	And so was I, you know, I was thinking, fuck you, this is good stuff.
2309000	2315000	So those are the things that, you know, it more or less obviously have populated my imagination.
2315000	2325000	I was surprised when you said that you didn't have these things until a little bit later in your life.
2325000	2336000	Because now it seems, I think many people are searching for something that they find in myth, and maybe you did that searching as well.
2336000	2354000	And I think one of the problems with our perception of myth, and especially maybe the Christian mythos, is the idea that's held now that if you went back 300 years, everyone fully believed in Christ or in God or in the elements of the mythos.
2354000	2366000	When, in fact, I think it's always been a thing that people have searched for, and a few people have found, rather than the actual held belief of everyone.
2366000	2373000	The holding of fixed belief with certainty is not part of faith. It wouldn't be faith if it was certain.
2373000	2377000	Faith is a matter of fidelity, in fact, that's the root of the word.
2377000	2389000	In other words, it's something that you give your loyalty to, because you think it's great and noble, and it will lead you to places of revelation, of illumination, and enlightenment.
2389000	2402000	And I think there's always been this tendency to think that signing up to six impossible things before breakfast is what religion is about, but it is not at all.
2402000	2419000	It's about enriching the way in which you see the entirety of the world, so that once you start to see the world with different eyes, it has meaning, it has direction and purpose, it has beauty and truth in it.
2419000	2428000	And these are the things that really seem to me to be the essence of a fulfilling life. Not to have those things is to be set adrift.
2429000	2443000	This is backed by scientific research, but it's also intuitively obvious that the things that give us a sense of meaning are not invented by us, but are contacted by us.
2443000	2458000	We are able to perceive them, and these are things we perceive with the help of nature, with the help of an intact tradition of a society, and through religions, or at any rate through a spiritual inclination.
2458000	2464000	And these things are all opposed to the machine. There's no place in them for the mechanical, the simply mechanical.
2464000	2485000	The simply mechanical is far too crude, leaves almost everything that's of important out. And so while it's useful, undeniably, it's only as good as the use is to which it's put, and often we're not the wisest assessors of what's going to happen when we start using it in a certain way.
2485000	2499000	And we're already finding that we've set in motion things that we cannot now easily stop. It's the story of the Sorcerer's Apprentice, you know, who knew how to utter the spell that would cause the machine to get going, but doesn't know how to stop it.
2499000	2513000	And now there's a lot of people who are warning us about the way in which this is going to impinge on humanity and perhaps take, if I may put it this way, the humanity out of humanity.
2513000	2532000	So I think these things are massively important. And to embrace that mythos of Christianity is not to force yourself to believe anything, but to listen, to open your heart and mind to what is expressed for me most powerfully through the arts that it has generated.
2532000	2553000	And so through the quite extraordinarily beautiful music, particularly of the Renaissance, and the extraordinarily fine paintings and the very moving poetry, and these things make clear to us things that otherwise we would ignore.
2553000	2565000	That's my idea in a nutshell that it's not surprising that we're highly stressed, depressed, anxious, don't know what we're doing, don't know where we're going, because we've chucked all the means towards meaning out.
2565000	2574000	I just want to emphasize again, you know, lots of people say, oh yes, you need these things like you make them up. Actually, you're in a padded cell, you can't see anything.
2574000	2582000	It's a horrible business and the sooner it's over, the better. But let's cheer ourselves up along the way by pretending that there's something out there.
2582000	2591000	No mate, there is something out there and we're part of it, by the way. Nature is not out there. Nature is in here and I am in nature.
2591000	2601000	And the divine realm is not something out there or up in the sky. It's something that's in here and I'm in it. And society is not something other than me.
2601000	2605000	I am in society and society is in me. These are the ways to say.
2605000	2624000	But when people try to turn to something like the Christian mythos, maybe it's fair to say that what they get first is that left-brained literal interpretation of the mythos, which is in its way dogmatic.
2624000	2632000	And they're meeting that with their own left hemisphere interpretation, which is where the arguments come up from.
2632000	2641000	So I don't want to give this to you because this starts to become a bit like a guru question, I guess.
2641000	2649000	But how do we then reconnect with our right hemisphere? That's a too big a question, I think.
2649000	2666000	But maybe just in that mythic sense, when someone is asking that question, well, the Minotaur doesn't literally exist or we don't have any historical evidence for X or Y.
2666000	2669000	What is an answer to that, do you think?
2669000	2681000	Well, not everything that is very real is tenable down. It's not capable of being fixed.
2681000	2690000	The left hemisphere wants things that are fixed and it can fix them in language and it can fix them by tracing a course in history.
2690000	2697000	But while that is a very useful idea, don't get me wrong, I don't disparage that, I use that all the time.
2697000	2704000	My mind is quite wrathful, actually. But it also realizes, using reason, that reason is not everything.
2704000	2711000	And Pascal himself said, reason is feeble indeed if it cannot explain that reason is not everything.
2711000	2725000	And of course, for people who like scientific and mathematical proofs, Gödel's theorem actually proves that there are things that are certainly true within a certain framework but cannot be proved within that frame.
2725000	2735000	So I think one needs to free oneself from the idea that one builds up a picture of reality from little nuggets that one puts together.
2735000	2739000	Well, I've got a fact there and a fact there, I put them here. Of course, they don't seem to mean anything.
2739000	2747000	Well, no, first of all, you've taken them out of context. They only mean something in the context that there is.
2747000	2754000	And so we need that business of bringing together, but it doesn't start from the bits.
2754000	2760000	It starts from the fact that things are already here and that our mind wants to break them up.
2760000	2768000	So one has to think in broader patterns over greater distances in time and in space.
2768000	2780000	So we are connected with others across time and space. We are as connected with our ancestors as we are with our descendants.
2780000	2785000	And we have loyalties to both and duties to both.
2785000	2794000	And we're also connected to people all around the world as we more and more perceive through the damage that has been done by industrialization.
2794000	2801000	And so I think the first thing is to perceive the world differently.
2801000	2806000	Often in a religion, people will say, and they're right.
2806000	2812000	To me, say a Christian, it's not to believe the following things and never doubt them.
2812000	2818000	But it is to see with new eyes, to feel with a new heart.
2818000	2823000	There is a medieval prayer, which I think is very important, God be in my head.
2823000	2829000	And it's very short. It's only a few lines. You know, God be in my head and in my understanding.
2829000	2833000	God be in my eyes and in my looking. God be in my mouth and in my speaking.
2833000	2838000	God be in my heart and in my thinking. God be at my end and at my departing.
2838000	2847000	And that very neat and short poem is very much about what I was talking about, internalizing something that is bigger than you.
2847000	2850000	And so the first thing is to change the cast of mind.
2850000	2854000	And people might say, well, how do I do that without working from step to step?
2854000	2859000	But that, again, is the left hemisphere. This is actually not the way things work.
2859000	2870000	Many things come as a moment of insight, as an aha moment, a re-jigging of a shape of a form, so that you see it anew.
2870000	2881000	And, boringly, as a psychiatrist, a lot of work that I have done is helping people to see for themselves what it is they need to do.
2881000	2888000	And that, you know, if you make the mistake, as when I was wet behind the ears and haven't had a lot of experience in psychology,
2888000	2893000	I used to do it just to tell people what they needed to do. It wasn't that I was wrong. I was right.
2893000	2897000	But the thing is, it's no good telling people until they see it for themselves.
2897000	2902000	And what's more, what they will see is greater than anything. I can tell them and more appropriate to them.
2902000	2910000	So that's what I'd say. I mean, of course, I can become banal and say there are things to do, like practice mindfulness, which I think is very important.
2911000	2922000	Practice being compassionate and grateful. These are simple things and listen more to music and attend to it.
2922000	2926000	Don't just, you know, have it on in the background and not pay attention to it.
2926000	2934000	So, and to read myths and re-engage really with a mythology.
2934000	2938000	And the best mythologies are religious mythologies, in my view.
2938000	2943000	I mean, they're the accumulation of wisdom with so many people over so long.
2943000	2951000	The idea that little me can in my lifetime with a little bit that I know improve on that is hubris, isn't it?
2951000	2955000	Isn't that just an extraordinary act of arrogance?
2955000	2962000	So it's not to say that, you know, traditions aren't changing. They're changing all the time. They flow.
2962000	2969000	But the only way in which we can make things go in the direction that we think is better is by engaging with that tradition.
2969000	2975000	It's like a plug that you want to go somewhere. You don't cut it off from its stem and roots and stick it on the wall.
2975000	2978000	You train it there, and that's what a tradition is like.
2978000	2985000	That's very cool. I think maybe I can push on that a bit.
2985000	2994000	So I think for people today, there is a great difficulty engaging with these religious traditions,
2994000	3003000	which I would say are kind of the great mythos, mythoses of our civilization.
3003000	3005000	Yeah, mythos.
3005000	3012000	So I think we're engaging instead with what you might call a synthetic mythos.
3012000	3020000	And two of the great figures in that happening. One is Joseph Campbell and his hero's journey or his mono myth.
3020000	3029000	So I would say it's kind of like a synthesizing. He takes all of this pattern from great mythic traditions,
3029000	3039000	especially the Christian tradition, and presents it as a pattern which is then picked up by storytellers,
3039000	3043000	famously Star Wars, but hundreds of other movies.
3043000	3050000	And these movies seem to be consistently very powerful for people. They have a real effect.
3050000	3059000	And then Campbell's ideas are really coming from Carl Jung and his ideas about archetypes and so on.
3059000	3067000	So could you comment perhaps a bit on the idea of could a synthetic mythos have value in that way,
3067000	3077000	and also about perhaps a relationship between Jung and your own thinking on the hemispheres and meaning of myth?
3077000	3087000	Yes, there is a very strong link between my thinking and Jung, and it really wasn't from reading Jung that I generated what I think.
3087000	3093000	It worked the other way that I worked from the neuroscience to see what the picture was.
3093000	3100000	And it wasn't always the one that people would anticipate. And yet I found constantly resonances with Jung's work.
3100000	3107000	And with Hillman, you know, James Hillman, who was a disciple, if you like, of Jung.
3107000	3118000	So yes, no, I agree with this. What I found is that myths I from all around the world have similar core perceptions.
3118000	3129000	At the beginning of part three of The Matter with Things, which is the section on ontology or metaphysics, whatever you like to call it.
3129000	3141000	And I quote at some length a myth of the Onondaga people who are Iroquois, which I think is staggering.
3141000	3148000	I mean, when I first heard it, I could not believe it. It was absolutely what I was seeing in the hemispheres.
3148000	3155000	It's the story of two brothers, one of which is more insightful and better motivated than the other.
3155000	3164000	But they both have divine power. And what needs to happen is that the one that is more fallible and more arrogant and more resentful,
3164000	3170000	this other brother, is kept, if you like, under the aegis of the wise brother.
3170000	3177000	But they shouldn't get too close together, because otherwise what the right hemisphere, the master, the better brother sees,
3177000	3180000	would be initiated by what the left hemisphere contributes.
3181000	3187000	And so that was a staggering one. But, you know, people don't have to espouse Christianity.
3187000	3194000	I happen to think it's the richest of all the mythologies. But there's so much in Vedanta. There's so much in Taoism.
3194000	3203000	I'm a Taoist. And there's no contradiction between being a Taoist and being, in my case, a very odd and probably not very good Christian.
3203000	3218000	But at least these are other ways of thinking that it's so rich that it's like them is to deprive yourself of all the things that to me seem to give life its richness.
3218000	3227000	So I hope people will rediscover it. And I think, although you say people are very resistant to this, I think they're resistant to the bad stuff.
3228000	3235000	And particularly when they look at religions as a fundamentalist and violent and hateful, that has nothing to do with religion.
3235000	3242000	Nothing. So, I mean, that's just a perversion of religion. There's a horrible exagressiveness from a religion.
3242000	3250000	But they are searching for myths, but not just the sort of myth that somebody made up yesterday, really.
3250000	3256000	But one that seems to reflect a deep insight into the nature of the cosmos.
3256000	3268000	And sometimes this can be done in less mythical terms. I mean, I hope that what I have, if you like, I certainly don't want to go on record of saying that I think the hemisphere differences is a myth,
3268000	3273000	except in the sense that this can be profoundly true in a logical way as well.
3273000	3281000	But it is, if you like, a helpful myth that enables people to see why certain things go together, you know.
3281000	3293000	Why, for example, would an attention to detail a failure to understand implicit meaning and a kind of insane optimism go together?
3293000	3301000	I mean, they don't sound like they should. But in fact, if you know about hemisphere differences, you can see exactly why they don't.
3301000	3305000	And then you can start seeing it in, I just put those three randomly together.
3305000	3309000	Because after all, there are so many differences, you can find many intersections.
3309000	3321000	But all I'm really saying is that the old vision of the right and left was just so wrong, and we need to really pay attention critically to what the real differences are if we're to know ourselves.
3321000	3330000	And you know, the great injunction of the ancient Greek world was know thyself. It's very simple, too worse, but so profound.
3330000	3337000	I think my before encountering your ideas, and they helped me to understand this much more clearly.
3337000	3345000	My way into some of this was through attempting to be creative, trying to write for me.
3345000	3352000	And then quite young, actually, I started teaching writing.
3352000	3359000	And one of the groups of people I would work with were people who were very intelligent, usually professionals.
3359000	3369000	They were now retired professionals. So they had a very highly trained intellect, and they were trying to crack this nut of being creative.
3369000	3387000	And I came up with my own myth about it, which I would use with people, which is that the part of you that wants to be creative is like a crazy old hippie that has huge ideas, often about myths, actually.
3387000	3402000	But in order to express it, you have to work with, you have to get the crazy old hippie to work with a kind of uptight middle manager who actually has the writing skills that are needed to do the writing.
3402000	3409000	And you have to somehow get these two characters into a room together and get them working together.
3410000	3417000	Which I think for me is something like the left and right hemispheres in their character.
3417000	3431000	But I feel that for a lot of people, their way into this is about this creative challenge. Like you try and write, but there's this inner editor who's always there criticising everything that you write.
3431000	3434000	So you never finish anything.
3434000	3444000	Well, just as I said, that's been a big problem in my life. I have a very strong inner critic.
3444000	3452000	But I think the only thing I'd have to do here is to dissociate myself from the idea that the right hemisphere is a crazy old hippie.
3452000	3461000	The right hemisphere is the fount of wisdom, really. And it's also very down to earth, by the way, unlike many hippies.
3461000	3469000	It is actually the one that is more in touch with reality and better grounded than the left, which goes off on fantasies.
3469000	3481000	But what I would add to your picture is that when people want to be creative, they're wanting to be creative is something to be slightly wary of.
3481000	3489000	Because it's one of those things that can't be wanted in a left hemisphere way. So what do I do? I follow the following steps.
3489000	3500000	And that is not going to work any more than I want to believe, you know, really work. And you can try. It's true.
3500000	3510000	But in a way, you have to open yourself up to something that you don't yet know what it is. And in order to do that, you have to still the part of your mind that is striving to achieve.
3510000	3521000	This part of your mind that says, I know what it is. I know what I need. Because every time we say, I know, we close down again on the familiar that we're trying to get away from.
3521000	3532000	And so a lot of time in creation passes in what appears to be unfruitful openness to things without any conclusions being drawn.
3532000	3545000	But it's only in that wise silence of not saying and not doing that things will begin to reveal themselves to us.
3545000	3558000	Steiner has written very well, George Steiner, on this idea of the sort of attentive mind that is hearing something. It's not quite clear yet, but it's leaning into it.
3558000	3572000	And that is a very good model, which he sees actually imaged in the four paintings of the Annunciation by Fra Angelica, in which the Virgin is sort of listening to the angel.
3572000	3580000	And the angel is sort of as if we're attending to the Virgin. Anyway.
3581000	3590000	Yeah, and just just sitting with some of that for a moment. When you said about your own inner critic.
3590000	3591000	Yes.
3591000	3603000	Have you do you feel that in the writing of nonfiction of these two books that you have you have silenced the critic to some extent.
3603000	3615000	I was curious when I can. The critic is usually most vocal and I'm trying to get started, which is a sort of catch 22.
3615000	3623000	And in fact, I only was able to write the master and his emissary by pretending to myself. And I really did believe that's what I was doing.
3623000	3636000	Okay. I wrote all the main concepts about 70 of them on little lozenges of paper and I laid them all out on the floor in the living room and moved them about to see where they went and see if I could find a diagram.
3636000	3646000	I really couldn't. So I said to myself, right, I'm no more than 25 pages, a skeleton of where you want to be going in this book.
3646000	3654000	And I headed it up as you can, of course, in word with the header that said draft out time of the master and his emissary.
3654000	3666000	And it finally reached about 1300 pages of text. And I printed it off and gave it to a friend of mine who I call my unofficial editor because he's so insightful.
3666000	3674000	And he had a shop. I gave it to him in a shopping bag and he looked at it and he saw the title and he said, some odd lie.
3674000	3679000	And indeed it was, but that was the way in which I sort of fooled myself into writing it.
3679000	3692000	But another thing is that I feel that when I'm writing well, stuff comes from that place, which is not entirely forced or intended.
3692000	3704000	Stuff asks me to be written. And I sometimes thought when I looked at the master's emissary and even more when I looked at the matter with things,
3704000	3713000	which as you know is an even greater task in terms of the amount of scholarship and science in it.
3713000	3720000	I sort of look at it and think, but how did you write that? I mean, you're a lazy person. How could you have written it?
3720000	3729000	So I have a conclusion that the mice wrote it in the night. The Taylor of Gloucester came down in the morning, not having enough gloss to the waistcoat.
3729000	3736000	He had to deliver in the morning and suddenly found the mice had made it. I feel not like that.
3736000	3742000	You see, the thing is that very little of what goes on is conscious. We have this idea that there are two tanks.
3742000	3758000	There's a sort of nice, big, clear tank of consciousness. And underneath is a slightly murky, muddy region, which has a sort of, perhaps a sort of flip column through which you can pass from one to the other.
3758000	3762000	But most of what goes on is in the consciousness. This is absolutely not true.
3762000	3779000	I mean, I used to say that 95% of all our mental activity is unconscious, but a paper with rather amusing precision that I quote in the book says that 99.44% for mental activity is not conscious.
3779000	3788000	In other words, you don't have to buy the precision to get the point that almost everything we do and not just the sort of lesser stuff goes on unconsciously.
3788000	3803000	So we solve difficult problems in maths in our life. We project how to deal with the future to make decisions to like things, to fall in love, to not.
3803000	3810000	All these things are going on under the radar and they're not unintelligent for that. They're using our full intelligence.
3810000	3822000	And you found a very, for a work of very, based on a lot of very rigorous research, you found a very potent myth to communicate.
3822000	3823000	Yes.
3823000	3837000	In the master and the master and his emissary, which I think is why it has communicated because this seems to be a very important part of communicating complex ideas to people.
3837000	3838000	Yes.
3838000	3852000	I think, for instance, like Einsteinian relativity is completely incomprehensible to most people, but the idea that you go to space and you come back and it's the future because of relativity.
3852000	3859000	That is the myth that people can actually get onto or the trains in relation to each other.
3859000	3860000	Yes.
3860000	3865000	What you're describing is quite a consistent story of myth makers.
3865000	3866000	Yes.
3866000	3874000	That this comes from somewhere beyond us, from artists and creators and scientists as well.
3874000	3881000	Anyone who reaches that real insight, it seems to come from beyond us.
3881000	3889000	So is that beyond the right hemisphere or is that simplifying too much?
3889000	3899000	I think that could be simplifying too much.
3899000	3905000	The thing is we don't know, really, the depths of our knowledge because if we did, we'd be conscious of it.
3905000	3916000	But I think that in our unconscious, we are making sense of clocking and understanding intuitively something about the way our mind and therefore our brain works.
3916000	3923000	And for me, the best demonstration of this is this Onondaga legend, which is completely amazing.
3923000	3927000	It's so accurate about how the train actually works.
3927000	3933000	And it comes from an era before there were any brain imaging studies.
3933000	3938000	So I think that's the way I put it.
3938000	3950000	The difficulty with the myth is that people who are very, if you like, narrow in their thinking think that if he's created a thing that submits, it must be wrong.
3950000	3952000	He's not a real scientist.
3952000	3957000	This is rather a shame because I've really sweated blood over the science.
3957000	3963000	And I defy anyone to show me exactly why I've got this wrong and nobody ever has.
3963000	3967000	In fact, there's a very interesting phenomenon, which is something like this.
3967000	3973000	Scientists say, well, I love the neuroscience and no quarrel with that.
3973000	3975000	It's very interesting and revealing.
3975000	3978000	But then you go on and apply it to life.
3978000	3980000	And I'm not with you there.
3980000	3984000	And then there are other people who say, well, I don't know about the neuroscience and so on.
3984000	3990000	But what you see in the evolution of Western culture is so right.
3990000	3993000	You know, it just cries out.
3993000	3997000	So you've got these two people, each of them sort of saying, yes, this bit is fine, this bit.
3997000	4001000	They don't want a corpus callatum to put them together.
4001000	4006000	But that's what I hope I have provided because they do need to be seen together.
4006000	4010000	And my editor at Yale for the Master in Science, I sort of said, you know, I think there are two books here.
4010000	4012000	We could make two books out of this.
4012000	4016000	And she very wisely said, yeah, but the trouble is that the scientists would read one
4016000	4020000	and the humanities people would read the other and never the train should meet.
4020000	4025000	And so I'm extremely glad that she insisted they should all be part of one book.
4025000	4028000	Can I ask you about the idea of the machine?
4028000	4029000	Absolutely.
4029000	4033000	Again, because this is very powerful in science fiction.
4033000	4034000	Yes.
4034000	4038000	We have from Frankenstein.
4038000	4042000	So Mary Shelley's Frankenstein written in the Gothic tradition,
4042000	4045000	but it's often recognized as the first science fiction.
4045000	4046000	Yes.
4046000	4050000	You of course have a scientist at the heart of it.
4050000	4057000	And but then this idea that you can put together a body from spare parts.
4057000	4065000	That if we've given up the idea of humans as some kind of divine entity, perhaps with a soul,
4065000	4067000	what do we say they are?
4067000	4070000	So we start to say that we're machines.
4070000	4078000	And Shelley reflects on that and reflects on the kind of the horror of that possibility.
4078000	4085000	A very famous science fiction movie like The Matrix where we're literally lost in machines
4085000	4087000	that control every part of our life.
4087000	4093000	And this is something I talk with about two of my podcast listeners.
4093000	4097000	Because I'd say about 70 percent of the science fiction community.
4097000	4098000	And I pull them on this.
4098000	4101000	If I asked them would say, yes, I am a machine.
4101000	4108000	And they might add to that that I am a biological, a biological machine.
4108000	4112000	So this seems to be the mythos of our time.
4112000	4116000	This is how we understand ourselves now as a machine.
4116000	4122000	And I know that that you can can see through that or pass that for us.
4122000	4133000	And I'd like you maybe to talk to my listeners who think that they are machines about how to have a larger picture of ourselves and that.
4133000	4140000	Well, in chapter 12 of The Matter With Things, a chapter called The Science of Life.
4140000	4144000	A case of left hemisphere capture.
4144000	4151000	What I'm arguing there is that organisms are holes that are not decomposable into their parts
4151000	4154000	and are not understood if viewed as machines.
4154000	4161000	And that's not anything I say without serious scientific evidence.
4161000	4168000	And there are a number of talks I've now done, perhaps half a dozen, with Michael Levin,
4168000	4179000	who is a distinguished professor at Tufts and a microbiologist and geneticist and evolutionary biologist about this.
4179000	4190000	And I think that more and more I see people realizing that the old story that was told that we were all, you know, this sort of...
4190000	4196000	I'm poor at talking, but this idea that somehow, you know, we're lumbering robots controlled by our genes for their benefits.
4196000	4204000	And that was a myth that was simply mythical in the pejorative sense.
4204000	4213000	And that we are not machines. And we could completely miss many things and can't explain many things if we think of ourselves as that.
4213000	4219000	I think I give at least eight ways in which we differ from machines and look over the evidence in some detail.
4219000	4223000	So I recommend people to read it if they're interested.
4223000	4232000	But I think there's a big problem here, which is more of a philosophical nature, that we don't understand the relationship between parts and the whole.
4232000	4236000	And what I think is that parts are an invention.
4236000	4251000	So what that is holds, in other words, not mechanical constructions, but non-divisible, although they have distinguishable parts,
4251000	4255000	but non-divisible holds that can't be reduced to that part.
4255000	4266000	And there was a great mathematician and philosopher called Robert Rosen, who wrote a book called Life Itself,
4266000	4276000	and a more approachable book called Essays on Life Itself, in which he argues that whatever exists is largely better understood
4276000	4283000	by assimilating it to the model of an organism than that of a machine, even the inanimate world.
4283000	4289000	And he leads to the conclusion that actually, inanimacy is something that doesn't really exist,
4289000	4298000	but would be the asymptotically approached reality if one pushed the mechanical idea far enough.
4298000	4300000	But it doesn't actually exist anymore.
4300000	4304000	And that when one starts realizing what one's dealing with is organic holds,
4304000	4311000	one understands their behavior and the way in which we understand them, we understand them much better.
4311000	4320000	So all that exists is holds, and what we see as parts are holds at another level.
4320000	4325000	And so there are, in a sense, a nesting of holds in the cosmos.
4325000	4333000	And different holds are appropriate at different levels of magnification, if you like, to talk in those terms.
4333000	4342000	So that's some of what I'd say, but I could quote some fascinating things that suggest that we're not.
4342000	4347000	Barbara Matintock, who won a Nobel Prize for her work in microbiology,
4347000	4357000	was able to show that microorganisms, bacteria, and single cells were able to respond in an imaginative way to a crisis
4357000	4362000	that they were never programmed to tackle and had never experienced before.
4362000	4367000	But they came up with a solution nonetheless, and that requires a certain kind of intelligence.
4367000	4372000	Whatever you like to say, it might not be intelligence like yours or mine, but it's some kind of an intelligence.
4372000	4376000	And there are many other instances throughout the natural world,
4376000	4381000	that plants that make decisions that they simply can't possibly have been prepared for
4381000	4386000	in strange situations set up in the laboratory, probably haven't got time to explain them here,
4386000	4389000	but they are ripping and amazing.
4389000	4395000	So we know that all that lives, and probably all the things that we don't think live,
4395000	4398000	behave in ways that we haven't completely fathomed.
4398000	4406000	And as you go further and further into the ultramicroscopic world of particle physics and so on,
4406000	4410000	you realize that once again the idea of a mechanism doesn't work.
4410000	4417000	So the way I look at it is the idea of a mechanism is a kind of shoddy model
4417000	4422000	that works okay for practical purposes in the middle of something,
4422000	4425000	but it doesn't work at all when you go small or go big,
4425000	4429000	and it doesn't work at all when you go in rather than out.
4429000	4435000	So as I sometimes say, if I were building a garage, I don't need to take into account the curvature of the world,
4435000	4437000	but that doesn't mean the world is flat.
4437000	4442000	The world is curved, and it's spherical, and that's really important to note.
4442000	4447000	But for certain purposes one can ignore reality, and the left hemisphere's model is not real.
4447000	4452000	It's a model, exactly that, and a machine is simply a model.
4452000	4456000	It's a way in which we have modeled things in order to be able to manipulate the world better.
4456000	4463000	And for those purposes they work, but a mistake is to think that because we've made something that works,
4463000	4469000	we understand the things of which it is only a remote cousin,
4469000	4473000	or not even that because it doesn't belong to the same family at all.
4473000	4477000	Could we almost argue then that there aren't any machines?
4477000	4485000	A machine is when we impose this map onto something which is actually a set of holes,
4485000	4491000	and we see it as a machine because we're going to use it for a certain purpose.
4491000	4498000	Yes, all the ways in which we understand things are models, and we improve the model or we don't.
4498000	4506000	And I think the model of the machine, yes, it works very well every day for making stuff to help us manipulate.
4506000	4514000	But it's not truthful, it's just a model, not a very good one, not a very sophisticated one, but it's fine.
4514000	4520000	And the proof of the pudding is that it has made us powerful, alas, without improving our wisdom.
4520000	4526000	And I would say we're probably the least wise people that have ever inhabited the earth, and yet we're also the most powerful.
4526000	4532000	This is a dangerous combination.
4532000	4539000	And we tell this story in myth over and over again that our machines are very powerful, but they're not wise.
4539000	4549000	And they're unable to wield meaningful, to create meaningful things in the world.
4549000	4552000	They will strip meaning out of everything.
4552000	4557000	But it seems very, I just want to push on it a little bit further.
4557000	4565000	It seems very, very, very sad that so many people see ourselves.
4565000	4572000	So certainly, probably up until my mid-twenties, I would have agreed with that assertion that I am a machine.
4572000	4578000	And I feel sad about that in retrospect for what I may have thought about myself.
4578000	4587000	And I think it was also accompanied with a lot of other thoughts, a certain despair, if the world is just a big machine.
4587000	4592000	Where is the meaning in any of this for me?
4592000	4600000	Well, yes, and you referred to images coming from the early 20th century.
4600000	4607000	And one that you probably know is the machine stops a short story by Am Forster, which is amazing.
4607000	4614000	He saw already in 1912, whenever he wrote it, that we were going to be ending up basically living in a machine depending on it,
4614000	4616000	and not really understanding what lay outside it.
4616000	4618000	So it is a worry.
4618000	4624000	But, you know, can a machine bleed?
4624000	4627000	To quote Bertrand de Venis.
4627000	4630000	Can a machine sorrow?
4630000	4632000	Can it fall in love?
4632000	4634000	Can it change its mind?
4634000	4637000	Can it truly imagine?
4637000	4642000	In what ways is a machine like us?
4642000	4650000	All that we do in AI is to project outwards a bloodless, abstracted way of thinking.
4650000	4660000	Turning something that is something we should be trying to get beyond, not enlarged.
4660000	4669000	And it is the means whereby the left hemisphere's thinking is pushed outwards into the world.
4669000	4677000	You see, because the left hemisphere loves the theory, it prefers anything that fits with the theory and doesn't see anything that doesn't fit with its theory.
4677000	4684000	So once you've decided that people are machines, for example, just to take an example, then you don't see all the evidence of things that don't fit with them.
4684000	4688000	Because the left hemisphere wants consistency with its model.
4688000	4693000	The right hemisphere is what V.S. Ramachandran, a very great neuroscientist, called the devil's advocate.
4693000	4696000	In other words, it says, yeah, but hang on, it might not be like that.
4696000	4703000	That says it's a really important element to have in one's armory.
4703000	4710000	And the right hemisphere's way of approaching things is, okay, you say this in theory.
4710000	4714000	Let's now test it against reality.
4714000	4721000	Now, that's great, but the difficulty is that the left hemisphere has colonized external reality.
4721000	4727000	So for many people, when they look outwards into the world, they see a screen, they see a machine, they see...
4727000	4736000	All around them, they see a bringing into being of this mechanical, utilitarian world, which is the left hemisphere's world.
4736000	4742000	And in recent years, it has pushed forward in two very damaging ways.
4742000	4753000	One is a colossal growth, like a cancer of administration, so that now all the institutions that look after us and look after our future,
4753000	4764000	the universities, the schools, the hospitals are top-heavy with departments of management that try to tell teachers and doctors and lecturers
4764000	4768000	what they should say and what they should do and who they should hire.
4768000	4771000	And this is a very bad state of affairs.
4771000	4777000	It's an expression outwards of left hemisphere procedural thinking, and the other is AI.
4777000	4782000	And now so much of time is wasted for all of us by machines.
4782000	4787000	So something that ten years ago would have taken a five-minute phone call to somebody in the office who said,
4787000	4789000	I see what's going on, don't worry, I can sort that.
4789000	4794000	But now I spend literally half a day on the internet, and instead of being able to speak to somebody, it says,
4794000	4796000	you know, we can help you.
4796000	4801000	I frequently ask questions, but the frequently asked questions are never the ones I'm really asking,
4801000	4804000	because they're too generic and I've got a typical problem here.
4804000	4809000	And, you know, there are boxes you have to check and things you have to go through to get there,
4809000	4813000	and I can't because nothing is truthful in response to them.
4813000	4815000	So this is a huge waste of time.
4815000	4821000	And you might, I don't know if I've got time just very briefly to refer to an amusing episode in recent history
4821000	4826000	when I gave a lecture for Oxford University and much of my amazement was paid for it.
4826000	4828000	It's delightful, it's rather handsomely paid for it.
4828000	4833000	And in the old days what would have happened is that the finance department called the University Chess
4833000	4836000	would have sent me a check in the post and I'd have cashed it.
4836000	4841000	But no, now lots of things have to be done through a platform online.
4841000	4847000	And not only one, but a couple of platforms, and you can only graduate to the second one once you've done the first.
4847000	4850000	And they said, don't worry, we've got someone who will guide you through this.
4850000	4854000	Three months into this process, not having got onto the second platform,
4854000	4857000	the person moved on to another job.
4857000	4859000	They said, don't worry, somebody else is coming.
4859000	4864000	Six months into this process, this other person and I had not been able to solve the problem.
4864000	4867000	And eventually I thought, what the hell is going on here?
4867000	4870000	Because it asked me to tick a box, and there were 77 boxes,
4870000	4874000	representing what I could have provided as a service to university.
4874000	4878000	And I could have provided window cleaning, I could have provided catering.
4878000	4884000	But there wasn't one for giving a lecture, which seems to me a rather fundamental part of the life of a university.
4884000	4888000	So I rang up and amazingly got a person, that won't happen in a few years' time.
4888000	4893000	And I said, this is hopeless, and he said, oh, tell me about it, it's the bane of our lives.
4893000	4898000	It's ridiculous. It doesn't correspond with reality, it gives us so much extra work.
4898000	4901000	Well, this is, of course, what's happening for all of us.
4901000	4905000	And so she said, I said, well, what do I do? Because I'm completely stuck, I can't move on.
4905000	4908000	I said, just tick any box and we'll pay you. So I tick window cleaning.
4908000	4911000	And they paid me, which is lovely.
4911000	4917000	And I justified it to myself by saying, metaphysically, I was cleaning their windows.
4918000	4929000	Well, they're the same thing, I guess, aren't they? The administration, the bureaucracy and the AI.
4929000	4930000	Exactly.
4930000	4936000	Because the only thing actually the AI will be able to do is perpetuate bureaucracy.
4936000	4941000	Perpetuate, which is already underway, yeah.
4942000	4955000	And what you said in there to pluck this out is that what the left hemisphere theorizes or models is less and less like reality.
4955000	4956000	Yes.
4956000	4957000	And more and more like a machine.
4957000	4958000	Yes.
4958000	4969000	And what we are doing is actually going further and further from a reality that we can't touch anymore
4969000	4974000	because we're in the mentality of the machine, we built the machines around us
4974000	4984000	and the machine is all of this idea about the world that the left hemisphere prefers to reality.
4984000	4987000	That's exactly right.
4987000	4995000	And what's interesting is that the, and I've come to see the importance of this more and more,
4995000	5001000	is that the left hemisphere doesn't really recognize anything it itself has not made.
5001000	5005000	So the right hemisphere is interested in what actually exists,
5005000	5010000	but the left hemisphere is interested in things that conform to the model of things it has made.
5010000	5015000	And so unless it has already got this idea, because remember it likes the familiar, the things that fit,
5015000	5021000	it doesn't like anything that disturbs that, anything that isn't made by it becomes target.
5021000	5030000	It believes that at the moment we see the war being waged on nature and on life by the left hemisphere world
5030000	5040000	and the things that don't fit with the narrative are being ignored, ostracized and dismissed, destroyed.
5040000	5050000	And the more and more of what we will get is the, quote, wisdom of some chat GBT with steroid on steroid,
5050000	5056000	which basically does a survey of the internet and comes up with stuff which has already been put there
5056000	5062000	largely by people who have been consulting chat GBT and no doubt its descendants in due course.
5062000	5067000	So what we're getting is a self-referential loop that it will be impossible eventually to break out of,
5067000	5072000	because anything other than that will be called untrue or pseudo-science or whatever.
5072000	5075000	We desperately need to get back to truth.
5075000	5082000	In Oxford on the 9th of February, I'm giving a talk to the university on truth
5082000	5089000	and why the university is becoming less and less relevant because it is turning away from the pursuit of truth.
5089000	5096000	Yeah, wow. Ian, I've had you for about an hour and 20 minutes of recording.
5096000	5099000	I'd love to carry on for a little bit longer as long as you're happy to.
5099000	5101000	Yes, I am, yes.
5101000	5104000	Okay, wonderful.
5104000	5120000	Let me go a bit, make a speculation here then, which I've had in response to your thinking quite a few times that
5120000	5133000	on the direction of myth and so we were talking about truth there, truth and reality basically.
5133000	5136000	So I'll put it on the table just as a statement.
5136000	5147000	We've said that as well, you made the point that myths tend to express these related world views or ideas.
5147000	5152000	There's a certain consistency across all of our myth way.
5152000	5168000	One I think is like the presence of some kind of higher being or a higher consciousness be it like gods or angels or davers in Hindu mythology.
5168000	5179000	Another we might point to is maybe a kind of other and other realm-ness which we speculate on in mythology.
5179000	5193000	So I want to ask, is it possible that the way that the right hemisphere sees the world is what it shows us then in the myths that it tells us?
5193000	5201000	Is this mythic reality that we've pushed so far away closer to a truth about our reality?
5201000	5209000	I would certainly say that.
5209000	5216000	It would be illogical for us to suppose that we knew everything or could understand everything.
5216000	5226000	I mean, if a mouse could think and speak as we do, it would say, well, there's nothing beyond what I know, but we know there is.
5226000	5232000	And there may be creatures in future or elsewhere that know more than we do.
5232000	5236000	But that knowledge exists whether we know it or not, if you like.
5236000	5239000	There is something there beyond what we can grasp.
5239000	5245000	It would be an extraordinary act of blind arrogance really to suggest, no, we know it all.
5245000	5247000	We understand it all.
5248000	5263000	There are deep intuitions and elements of experience that suggest that there is more to this cosmos than we know the full story of.
5263000	5266000	It's not a very extravagant claim actually.
5266000	5276000	And the right hemisphere is able to put us in touch with that better than the left, because the left only understands what it's grasped as things it could make or has made.
5276000	5282000	So its world is populated by its own conceptions, but the trouble is that its own conceptions are too narrow.
5282000	5290000	And the way to break out of this is by engaging the not fanciful right hemisphere, but the imaginative right hemisphere,
5290000	5297000	which is able to see into things deep into them in a way that the left hemisphere cannot.
5297000	5300000	So I do believe that, yes.
5300000	5312000	And I think the notion that there is a cosmos out there and greater than us is a great relief in a way,
5312000	5321000	because you then can begin to open up and feel that it is not your job somehow to sort it all out or to...
5321000	5329000	But it is your job and this is a serious duty to respond to it, to at least respond to it.
5329000	5334000	I believe truth is a relationship. Truth is an encounter.
5334000	5344000	It's not stuff just out there, and it's not just stuff I made up, but it's what comes about from my encounter with everything else.
5344000	5348000	And obviously every other person's encounter with everything else.
5348000	5351000	Now that doesn't mean that we just make it up.
5351000	5359000	It means that there is a reality that it behoves us to be true to in the way that we use the word true in a belief.
5359000	5366000	I know I'd be true to somebody that I'm loyal and when you live in that truth and in that loyalty,
5366000	5371000	that whatever it is then begins to grow and become part of you and you become part of it.
5371000	5376000	So it is a generative encounter in which both parties are untouched.
5376000	5382000	And so what we need to get away from is the idea that there is a truth as it were in a box somewhere
5382000	5385000	and we take a path towards it and we open the box and we've got it.
5385000	5390000	It is in fact a journey. It will always be a journey because it's one that can never be fully completed.
5390000	5396000	But the fact that it can never be fully completed is not a problem because the value of it is in
5396000	5406000	honorably, truthfully, loyally, magnanimously, generously, kindly, following that path.
5406000	5411000	Bearing in mind the higher values, not just those that are useful to us,
5411000	5414000	but things like goodness, beauty and truth.
5414000	5418000	So this is the vision that I have.
5418000	5423000	I can't help people for whom it means nothing, but to me it means a very great deal.
5423000	5429000	And it also means that in a way your life is not pointless or purposeless.
5429000	5434000	No, your purpose and point is to help grow the good things that are in the cosmos.
5434000	5438000	It's beauty, not to bring ugliness, not to bring destruction,
5438000	5445000	but to bring more connection, more kindness and tolerance, more beauty, more goodness into the world.
5445000	5449000	I mean, I'm sorry if I sound preachy, but hell, I mean, these are important messages.
5449000	5453000	And, you know, I don't really have paid up member of any religion,
5453000	5457000	but that shouldn't stop me from seeing these things.
5457000	5464000	I think that mythos precedes religion.
5464000	5465000	Yes.
5465000	5470000	Religion maybe is that kind of formalized dogmatic thing,
5470000	5473000	but mythos is trying to show us.
5473000	5474000	I agree.
5474000	5476000	But also it takes it further.
5476000	5480000	So it's very difficult to engage simply with the mythos
5480000	5483000	without all the other things that religion begins.
5483000	5488000	I mean, the word means a binding and it means becoming together minds who can pursue things,
5488000	5492000	who can share things, who can feel a relationship.
5492000	5496000	And this is very important for human flourishing.
5496000	5503000	And we're also very beautiful, as I was saying, works of art and rituals,
5503000	5506000	and indeed myths that have been generated by religion.
5506000	5508000	So it's a two-way flow.
5508000	5511000	When religion becomes too sclerotic, then it's a problem.
5511000	5512000	I agree.
5512000	5516000	But it also does a sort of two-way dance with our mythical sense
5516000	5521000	in helping us to guide that because we might have a myth of,
5521000	5524000	I mean, anything really in a way.
5524000	5528000	And that could be unfortunate because, I mean,
5528000	5532000	most people can see the falsity of certain kinds of myths.
5532000	5536000	For example, the myth that was perpetuated throughout most of the 20th century
5536000	5538000	by the Soviet Union or by Mao.
5538000	5539000	These were mythologists.
5539000	5544000	They were profoundly destructive, horribly cruel,
5544000	5547000	and attacked everything good and beautiful.
5547000	5551000	So these are not good myths.
5551000	5554000	So we need to have in a way a bit of a touchstone.
5554000	5557000	And that can be an internal touchstone.
5557000	5562000	But it can also benefit from, after all,
5562000	5566000	the condensate of knowledge of people from days gone by
5566000	5570000	who were not stupid because they weren't us or didn't know things we know.
5570000	5573000	There's lots of things they knew that we have forgotten.
5584000	5586000	I want to push a little bit more.
5586000	5593000	I want to be the voice of some of my podcast listeners for a second
5593000	5599000	who, they kind of willingly listen to me talking about myth,
5599000	5602000	but they don't really think science fiction is myth,
5602000	5605000	and they think myth is just made up.
5605000	5608000	So now I've just put the idea on the table for them that,
5608000	5614000	no, actually, myth is a bit more like reality than August.
5614000	5617000	The myth is at least necessary.
5617000	5624000	And I think they would, at this point, actually have some anger about it.
5624000	5633000	Because they have this perception of myth as lie,
5633000	5640000	and they don't want a lie asserted as real.
5640000	5645000	So I just channeled them to that length there.
5645000	5648000	So what more could we say to them?
5648000	5654000	Well, the first thing is to be aware when you're finding something makes you angry.
5654000	5659000	I don't mean just in the way that a psychiatrist would say,
5659000	5663000	that's probably showing you a conflict in you that you're not recognizing.
5663000	5670000	But I mean that anger is absolutely the main mode of operation of the left hemisphere.
5670000	5673000	It's always angry, and it's always right, by the way.
5673000	5677000	It always knows what the truth is, thinks it does.
5677000	5679000	But of course, you know, from my work,
5679000	5683000	that actually it's often frankly deluded, completely deluded,
5683000	5687000	but it's emphatic that what it thinks it knows is the only story.
5687000	5692000	Thinking you know the only story is also, I would say, a bit of an alarm bell.
5692000	5695000	Are you really sure about that?
5695000	5700000	And what about listening to a few other people and seeing if that has rings of bells?
5700000	5709000	The other thing I'd say is that, what about poetry?
5709000	5714000	Poetry takes us to places that are not just literal scientific facts,
5714000	5718000	but I'm prepared to say that poetry is lies.
5718000	5723000	If so, I can't really help you, I'm just interested to know.
5723000	5730000	Because if you think that, you're going to miss out on an enormous amount of experience
5730000	5735000	that is profoundly, it speaks to us as embodying truths,
5735000	5744000	truths that are much harder to express in the language one might use for a dishwasher instruction manual.
5744000	5747000	And so what are we really saying?
5747000	5757000	It was only with Locke in the 18th century that people started to talk about myths and poetry and so on as lies.
5757000	5762000	And one has to be very careful about that,
5762000	5769000	because there are things that can be believed as unshakably true
5769000	5775000	because we've proved them according to what we know, which we now know are not true.
5775000	5781000	So until Rutherford, we thought that the universe really obeyed Newtonian mechanics,
5781000	5787000	but there's ample evidence over the last 100 years that this is simply not the case.
5787000	5791000	And we're now seeing, as I say in biology, that there's evidence,
5791000	5796000	that there are whatever you like to call them, form fields or whatever,
5796000	5801000	that guide the development of an organism that are nowhere to be found in the genome.
5801000	5804000	We believed it was all in the genome, then we sequenced the genome,
5804000	5810000	and we found there wasn't, not only was there wasn't enough information, but there was hardly any.
5810000	5813000	And it was so small the amount of information.
5813000	5820000	It was many orders of magnitude, too little, to express what it is that organisms can do.
5820000	5825000	So we're now opening our minds again and thinking, well, maybe there's something else going on here.
5825000	5829000	Think about that. You come to different conclusions.
5829000	5835000	And I think it's worth mentioning that almost all the physicists of the 20th century,
5835000	5841000	the great ones who one thinks of was having developed quantum mechanics,
5841000	5848000	people like Niels Bohr, Max Planck, Heisenberg, Schwerdinger, and so on.
5848000	5854000	I don't need to go through the panoply, but practically all of them had a great deal of time
5854000	5857000	for religious myths.
5857000	5862000	And in fact, there is, I quote in the book,
5862000	5866000	evidence about the beliefs of Nobel Prize winners.
5866000	5869000	The Nobel Prize has been awarded since 1900.
5869000	5875000	So we have evidence over the last 120 years of the religious beliefs of people who won Nobel prizes.
5875000	5881000	Are scientists less religious than the people who are at the top of their game in the humanities?
5881000	5889000	No. In the humanities, the rate of people who at some point in their life have been disbelievers in the divine
5889000	5894000	is about 35%. It's still not a majority, but it's pretty large.
5894000	5899000	And as you go down into the sciences, it's something like,
5899000	5905000	it's something like 89% for biology, about 7% for chemistry,
5905000	5910000	and it's 4.9, 4.7% for physicists.
5910000	5915000	They are the most religious people. And it's also the hardest science, frankly.
5915000	5924000	So I just ask all these people who just know they're right and get very angry when someone says something they don't agree with,
5924000	5929000	to, you know, calm down, take a deep breath,
5929000	5936000	consider that you might not know everything, that the things you believe are right might only temporarily seem to be right,
5936000	5942000	and are just a stepping stone on reaching greater truth, greater wisdom.
5942000	5948000	That's all I can say. The great thing as a psychiatrist is that you know there are people who can't help.
5948000	5954000	And say, you stop banging your head against, you know, I'm never going to win this person over.
5954000	5960000	So you stop worrying about it. There are always going to be people who don't see what it is you're talking about.
5961000	5966000	Everybody has to sit with the truth as they know, and the consequences of that.
5966000	5972000	So good luck, you know, if you're one of the angry young men or angry old men.
5972000	5974000	There we go.
5974000	5982000	Well, I think it's something we've lost in our teaching, because we're not allowed to offend students.
5982000	5989000	It's that you can't really teach anything without pushing people to the point of anger,
5989000	5992000	because it's part of our development.
5992000	5999000	Can I put one more big question on the table for you before we wrap up, which is the future.
5999000	6007000	So obviously the future is a big part of science fiction, and I think that's because the future has become very important to us.
6007000	6013000	We don't have another world to think about, so we think about the future of this world.
6014000	6021000	And you mentioned actually Stalin and Mao, I think, just now.
6021000	6028000	So that was one kind of utopian vision of the future, maybe a future with no injustice,
6028000	6033000	assuming we give them the credit that they actually believed what they were saying.
6033000	6040000	So we have that utopian future, but the most powerful future seems to be progress.
6040000	6048000	The future will have progressed, primarily technologically will have better technology.
6048000	6053000	But none of these seem to be particularly compelling futures for us at the moment.
6053000	6062000	We think more actually about Armageddon and dystopia and the destruction of the world, maybe via climate change.
6062000	6077000	So I wonder if you have thoughts on the future and maybe a big question about maybe what might a more hemispherically balanced future look like?
6077000	6081000	What might a more right hemisphere future look like, perhaps?
6083000	6090000	Well, of course, the talking of myths, the myth of progress is a very singular idea.
6090000	6095000	I mean, it was never espoused before by any other culture, but it's become ours since Enlightenment,
6095000	6100000	which was a very valuable but also a futuristic movement that believed that it knew everything
6100000	6106000	and understood everything and that the future would be ever more wonderful.
6106000	6113000	I read a wonderful German haiku the other day, which basically translated goes,
6113000	6117000	in the past it was good, then everything became much better.
6117000	6119000	If only it were good again.
6119000	6130000	Anyway, I think predicting the future is famously a mug's game, so I don't know.
6130000	6135000	But I think it's very wise of us to think about the consequences of our actions.
6135000	6146000	And I take that the cautionary principle has a great deal in it and that there are certain steps you can take that will be extremely hard to reverse.
6146000	6154000	And we've talked a bit about that already, how a cage that's made out of self-referring loops will be very difficult to break out of.
6154000	6158000	So I do worry about that, and I think it's the way we're going.
6158000	6171000	And it's certainly the case that the greatest crimes in the history of humanity in terms of their scope and severity have been conducted by people who thought they knew how to make a better world.
6171000	6177000	So we have Lenin and Stalin and Mao and Paul Parton and so on.
6178000	6190000	People who are a little bit more humble and want to work with people to make them to change their understanding of other people, to be more tolerant of other people, not less tolerant of them, would be important.
6190000	6198000	So I think what I would say is there's a more hemisphere balance future, would be a beautiful place to live.
6198000	6211000	It would be one where, yes, science made progress, but it wasn't trampled by, as we now know, that science is being trampled by a form of political correctness and wokeness.
6211000	6217000	There are certain things that are true, but are known to be true, but can't be said and are dismissed.
6217000	6225000	And other things that, because they promote the received narrative, are not good science, but are not as published.
6225000	6243000	And a recent piece of research shows that scientists, the majority, nearly all, in fact, in the words of the piece of research, scientists consulted in the US, said that they, to some extent, self-centered what it was they said or thought or investigated.
6243000	6248000	So it would be a world that was more in touch with truth, but also a kinder one.
6248000	6261000	Because, you know, for all that we're trying to achieve this wonderfully balanced and lovely world, I've noticed during my lifetime a great loss of joy and peacefulness.
6261000	6278000	You know, in the world I grew up, we know more sort of, you know, the things that trouble us now as huge problems, maybe we should have done, but in fact, there was more understanding between the sexes.
6278000	6285000	There was probably less anxiety between and fear between the races.
6285000	6292000	And I know that's a difficult area to go into, because there are all kinds of points of view, and I respect that it's complicated.
6292000	6297000	But I think it's also worth considering that we haven't necessarily made it all better.
6297000	6307000	In fact, what we've done, whatever we have done, is produce a world which is wracked with mental illness, and in which people feel adrift and don't know what to say or what to believe.
6307000	6318000	So I think in that world we would have returned to a sense of purpose, which was anchored around the great values of goodness, beauty and truth, and a sense of the sacred.
6318000	6332000	And we would begin to work together rather than work against one another, not feeding conflict and adversity, and I'm right, you're wrong, and I need power, and you must have less.
6332000	6338000	But instead, a sort of seeing that we can work together.
6338000	6347000	This is so elementary that it's been part of all the people who have really helped humanity forward in the last, you know, in the 20th century.
6348000	6363000	And indeed of Martin Luther King, and Nelson Mandela, I mean, we need to work together to cooperate, because if we don't, we'll die.
6363000	6365000	I mean, there's no question about it.
6365000	6371000	And you know, interestingly, the story of evolution is not one of constant opposition and aggression.
6371000	6372000	That comes into it.
6372000	6374000	It's a very important part of the picture.
6374000	6380000	But actually, the species that have been most successful have been those who learned to cooperate.
6380000	6385000	So cooperation is a big part of becoming whatever we are.
6385000	6397000	And I would say that if we could adopt a little more humility about what we know, faced with an insight into actually how little we understand.
6397000	6409000	If we could rediscover compassion and the art of gently listening to people in a non-patronizing way, but being able to discuss whatever.
6409000	6411000	Nothing should be off limits.
6411000	6416000	We should be able to talk about it in a reasonable way, and hear one another out.
6416000	6423000	And a sense of wonder at the beautiest nature of the world, which is not just a foregone mechanism.
6423000	6430000	These things would ultimately alter the way in which we experience life.
6430000	6437000	And I think that we need to be gravitating towards them as fast as we can.
6437000	6444000	Recovering civility, teaching children in school, how to negotiate, how to argue two sides of a question,
6444000	6449000	how to arbitrate between warring parties,
6449000	6454000	how to do something that is normally only taught to people too late in life when their marriage is on the rocks,
6454000	6460000	which is how to talk to another person and hear what it is they're saying.
6460000	6464000	So, you know, in couple counseling there's a thing you do where you say,
6464000	6466000	no, you say what it is.
6466000	6468000	No, no, you'll have your moment in a minute.
6468000	6471000	Let him speak or let her speak.
6471000	6474000	And when that's finished, then the other person's allowed to reply.
6474000	6479000	What they must do is to say back what it is they've heard the other person say.
6479000	6483000	And very often that is so revealing as you find that there was a misconception.
6483000	6485000	That wasn't what they were saying at all.
6485000	6487000	And so there is common ground.
6487000	6493000	And finding that common ground is what we need.
6493000	6497000	So, I don't know the answer to these things.
6497000	6499000	I can give pointers.
6499000	6501000	I can give hope.
6501000	6505000	I can say we only are asked not to solve massive problems on our own,
6505000	6508000	to cooperate with others towards ends we believe in,
6508000	6512000	and to bring integrity into our own lives.
6512000	6517000	And as much as possible, avoid saying things we know to be wrong.
6517000	6525000	Avoid furthering things that will restrict freedom and restrict the expression of beauty.
6525000	6530000	And re-sophisticate our idea of what good is, which comes from the heart.
6530000	6532000	It's not following rules.
6532000	6534000	It's not ticking boxes.
6534000	6543000	It's about something that's in here, a disposition of the soul.
6543000	6548000	Well, much of that sounds like ancient wisdom.
6548000	6551000	And I think maybe one of the...
6551000	6557000	I hope, well, I've observed this already in telling people about your work,
6557000	6561000	and in talking with people who are already familiar with it,
6561000	6569000	is that this placing this understanding of the dual hemispheres
6569000	6576000	gives us in itself a myth, a story to understand this through.
6576000	6583000	So, I could say to people, listen to the good.
6583000	6586000	But that doesn't make sense to people.
6586000	6592000	But I think to say, maybe we can work from our right hemisphere for a while,
6592000	6594000	with all of the attached meanings to that,
6594000	6601000	is actually, it is in itself a way into all of the things which you're saying,
6601000	6603000	which we can all agree with,
6603000	6607000	but we don't have a central signal to discuss it through.
6607000	6611000	And I hope that your work is actually giving that to people.
6611000	6614000	Are you seeing that in...
6614000	6618000	Are you seeing some impact of your ideas in the world when you talk to people?
6618000	6621000	It's hard to judge, because, of course, to some extent,
6621000	6627000	the people that I encounter are going to be the people who are more open to it.
6627000	6637000	But I certainly do get a colossal amount of feedback that is so heartening to me,
6637000	6642000	because I never foresaw that by writing, I thought about an interesting topic
6642000	6644000	that some people would fix on and say,
6644000	6647000	yeah, interesting, maybe we should investigate this more.
6647000	6649000	I thought basically it would all be forgotten,
6649000	6653000	but it hasn't been and that people see the meaning that I'm trying to propagate
6653000	6655000	is extraordinary heartening.
6655000	6659000	Young people in particular are more open to this.
6659000	6667000	The people who are a problem are the established smug intellectuals.
6667000	6672000	They're practically all white and they think they know what's best
6672000	6678000	for people of all races and people of different sexes and so on.
6678000	6683000	So they think they know, and the story is a played out story.
6683000	6688000	And what we're experiencing is a conflict between an enforced ideology
6688000	6691000	which sees people in system and what our heart is telling us.
6691000	6693000	And that's a very uncomfortable place to be.
6693000	6696000	And I think that's what's causing a lot of the grief,
6696000	6701000	the fear, the panic, the anxiety, the stress and the gloom.
6701000	6707000	If we could find a world in which people spoke recognizable truths to us again,
6707000	6709000	this would be wonderful.
6709000	6713000	Because one's heart sings when one hears something that one can respond to
6713000	6716000	and that one knows in one's heart is right.
6716000	6718000	I mean, you say people don't know where to go for truth,
6718000	6724000	but I think they kind of do because they can see the big picture with their right hemisphere
6724000	6728000	and they can see the way in which this is being discussed and unpacked
6728000	6735000	and they can see in it something different from what it is they're being served up all the time
6735000	6737000	and worrying about.
6737000	6741000	I am in that sense a hopeful pessimist, as I often say.
6741000	6744000	I'm hopeful in the sense that I always have great hope in humanity.
6744000	6747000	You don't know what they'll come up with. They're amazingly resourceful.
6747000	6749000	They're wonderful beings, actually.
6749000	6754000	One of the things I'm very opposed to is the constant derogation of humanity.
6754000	6756000	Yes, of course, we've made an almighty cock up.
6756000	6758000	That's absolutely true.
6758000	6762000	And there's lots of things we've done that we would now not do in that way.
6762000	6765000	But there is something amazing about human beings.
6765000	6768000	If we can live in harmony with the rest of the natural world,
6768000	6770000	there's no reason why we shouldn't.
6770000	6775000	In fact, that's what we need to be encouraging ourselves to do.
6775000	6781000	So yes, I am hopeful, very hopeful, of what will come forth.
6781000	6788000	It will come forth from young people because young people are not less indoctrinated.
6788000	6792000	You know, Max Planck famously said science moves forward a funeral at a time.
6792000	6797000	It's not that you convince the oldies who've held the power that you've got something to say.
6797000	6799000	It's the young people who say it.
6799000	6801000	And there are lots of researchers now who write to me,
6801000	6804000	where can I go where I can research your things and so on?
6804000	6807000	I'm not really sure, but anywhere that's got an open enough mind,
6807000	6812000	you've got to be able to find people who will welcome you in their midst.
6812000	6820000	I have a feeling much more is going to form around your world in the next few years.
6820000	6822000	I certainly hope so.
6822000	6826000	Can I thank you for joining me and also thank you for your work,
6826000	6830000	which has had a big influence on me over the last few years.
6830000	6832000	Thanks for having me along.
6832000	6837000	I've thoroughly enjoyed talking and I'm very glad that my work resonates with you
6837000	6839000	and means something to you.
6839000	6843000	As I am to so many people who please carry on writing,
6843000	6845000	don't feel I've heard it too many times.
6845000	6848000	I can never hear it enough that people write and tell me.
6848000	6850000	Very good. Thank you.
