0	6000	We are about to have AI reinvent global education and health care.
6000	9000	This is the biggest shift in human history.
9000	12000	We are at a perfect store, perfect store.
12000	14000	Your mindset, our brains are neural nets.
14000	17000	They're being shaped constantly by everything we watch,
17000	21000	everything we read, the conversations we have, our communities and so forth.
21000	24000	In the age of the rise of the machines,
24000	28000	the only skill that will remain is human connection.
28000	30000	We need to bring that back to our children.
30000	32000	We need to teach them resilience.
32000	37000	It's training them to respond to anything that happens.
37000	41000	You may tell yourself, I'm about to lose my job because of AI.
41000	42000	Is this true?
42000	43000	Yes, it is.
43000	45000	Live, because you know what?
45000	48000	You have certainty that today is not a perfect storm yet.
48000	50000	Think about this minute.
50000	53000	How can I savor this minute fully?
54000	59000	I'm going to transition the conversation, staying on kids.
59000	63000	Kristen and I have two 12-year-old boys,
63000	68000	and they're, you know, a joy after this podcast is over.
68000	72000	I'll be going and hugging them and spending time with them for sure, extra.
72000	75000	And one of the things that we're thinking about,
75000	78000	because they're in sixth grade and heading towards high school,
78000	84000	in a world that is very different than the world you and I grew up in.
84000	89000	And I am clear that today's schooling system set aside college,
89000	96000	but junior high school, high school is not preparing our kids for what's coming.
96000	99000	Our school system is based on the industrial era.
99000	102000	Everyone's, you know, prepared for the test.
102000	107000	Everybody is going from station to station learning things like one of our boys,
107000	111000	Jet, just had to memorize all 50 state capitals.
111000	114000	Now, it's great to practice your memorization,
114000	119000	but really, how and when are you going to ever have that be useful?
119000	123000	You know, especially when Google is still a dominant force.
123000	127000	So the question I have, and for those who are listeners,
127000	131000	our parents is what should our kids be learning?
131000	136000	You know, this is coming back smack into the conversation around the rise
136000	144000	of AI and what do we need to teach our kids to prepare them for this decade ahead?
144000	148000	And I have a list that I've come up with.
148000	154000	And then I went and asked, you know, chat GPT, the same question and similar,
154000	156000	but slightly different list.
156000	163000	But I'd like to ask you in a world, let's call it, you know, we're 2023.
164000	170000	We're going about to see AI become, what's your, well, I'll ask you this, you know,
170000	176000	Ray Kurzweil, who we both know well, has predicted human level AI by 2029.
176000	181000	There are others who are predicting it far before then, by the way, right?
181000	186000	There are those that are looking at, you know, 2025 and between 2025 and 29.
186000	192000	So what should our kids be learning in a world of human level AI?
192000	196000	By the way, embedded in everything where everything is smart all the time.
196000	198000	What are the skills?
198000	200000	Amazing question.
200000	204000	And probably the most difficult question to ask now, not for just, I mean,
204000	206000	not just for our kids, but for everyone.
206000	209000	I mean, if you're a graphics designer today or if you're a programmer,
209000	214000	the episode with Ahmed, with Ahmed Mushtaq was amazing, Peter.
214000	216000	It was an amazing conversation.
216000	219000	People who haven't listened to it should go back and listen.
219000	224000	You know, the world is fundamentally changing in ways that we could not understand.
224000	230000	I think I will say there are four things that need to be educated.
230000	236000	Okay. None of them have anything to do with what we, our school systems are teaching.
236000	240000	The first and very straightforward one is jump into AI.
240000	242000	Okay. You have to learn this.
242000	245000	This is the biggest shift in human history.
245000	252000	This is the biggest change in the tools that we use to navigate the world.
252000	253000	Right?
253000	259000	If I told you that we now have robotic arms that are going to be building cars,
259000	264000	you shouldn't spend any time in learning how to use a hammer to shape matter.
264000	265000	Okay.
265000	267000	So learn how the robotic arm works.
267000	269000	The new robotic arm is AI.
269000	272000	So jump in AI, understand every part of it.
272000	274000	You don't need a school to do that.
274000	278000	You know, because I speak about AI quite a bit, a lot of people ask me,
278000	282000	so which book do you recommend I read or which course should I take?
282000	284000	And I go, like, go ask Chad GPT that.
284000	285000	Right?
285000	286000	Why are you asking me?
286000	287000	And seriously, right?
287000	290000	And I think the idea is, like the other two,
290000	295000	very few people actually went to courses on Excel or, you know, email.
295000	296000	You play.
296000	297000	You play.
297000	299000	Yeah, you play around and you learn.
299000	301000	So this is number one.
301000	307000	Number two is I would say that in the age of the rise of the machines,
307000	312000	the only skill that will remain is human connection.
312000	320000	The only skill in my personal view that will be valuable when the machines
320000	322000	outsmart us in everything.
322000	324000	By the way, it doesn't matter.
324000	326000	I always want to bring this back.
326000	327000	I'm sorry.
327000	329000	I'm going to go back to number two in a second,
329000	337000	but it doesn't matter if AGI comes out and we have the singularity as per
337000	340000	Ray's definition, 2029.
340000	345000	I actually definitely believe AGI will be earlier than 2029, but it doesn't
345000	346000	matter.
346000	351000	What matters is if you're a graphics designer and stability AI, you know,
351000	354000	produced stable diffusion, you're screwed.
354000	355000	It's over.
355000	356000	Okay.
356000	358000	We don't need AGI for your life to be disrupted heavily.
358000	362000	We don't need AGI to replace lawyers.
362000	366000	We don't need AGI to augment doctors and so on and so forth.
366000	367000	This is in the making.
367000	369000	It's happening very, very fast.
369000	374000	So don't wait for that imaginary moment or that future moment to say,
374000	375000	ah, now we're in shit.
375000	378000	We're approaching those situations already.
378000	383000	So when all of that happens and all of those skills are replaced with humans,
383000	388000	I would say that the most valuable skill is human connection.
388000	390000	So take my situation.
390000	392000	I am an author.
392000	393000	Okay.
393000	397000	And a speaker and in a way a teacher if you want.
397000	398000	Okay.
398000	400000	And a podcaster.
400000	401000	Right.
401000	406000	So as an author, I don't think I should write books anymore.
406000	407000	Okay.
407000	410000	I take too long to write them.
410000	412000	The industry is very slow to publish them.
412000	417000	And the supply demand equation of books is going to be disrupted so badly
417000	420000	because books now can be written in 15 minutes.
420000	421000	Okay.
421000	424000	That there will be so much supply on the market that by definition,
424000	427000	the dilution will affect the value of any book.
427000	431000	And in all honesty, I don't assume I'm smarter than Chad GPT.
431000	434000	I may be a little more genuine than Chad GPT.
434000	437000	I may be a little more original than Chad GPT.
437000	439000	At least for the moment.
439000	440000	Yeah.
440000	444000	And some of my writing, but that advantage is not going to last for the next two to three
444000	445000	years.
445000	451000	So, but if I know a concept and I have a chance to talk to you as a human Peter,
451000	454000	I don't think the machines will reach that within the next four to five years.
454000	455000	Right.
455000	460000	So human connection, even if the machines reach that in four to five years is what we will
460000	462000	crave as humans.
462000	463000	Right.
463000	467000	There will be sex robots, but I can guarantee you will still need a hug.
467000	468000	Yes.
468000	475000	So there will be, you know, articles written by there are tons of articles written by AI
475000	476000	today.
476000	480000	There is a ton of code written by AI today, but there is always going to be that need
480000	485000	for a human to consult human to, you know, a circle of support if you want.
485000	487000	So that's skill number two.
487000	491000	Skill number two is learn how to connect to humans at a deeper level.
491000	499000	It's a skill that has been declining since the rise of social media.
499000	507000	In the words are the skills that humans have to focus on connection and deliver and maximize
507000	508000	connection.
508000	515000	But we also spoke in our last podcast mode that AI will begin to emulate human connection.
515000	516000	Correct.
516000	520000	And your timeframe for that was within the next 10 years.
520000	522000	Oh, if not shorter.
522000	523000	Yeah.
523000	530000	I mean, in all, in all honesty, I think it will become very confusing within the next
530000	531000	three.
531000	533000	If you remember the movie her.
533000	535000	I remember it well.
535000	536000	Yeah.
536000	543500	Her basically an AI simulates a friend and then she becomes quite, you know, he becomes
543500	546000	very occupied with loving her as an AI.
546000	547000	Okay.
547000	549000	It's an interesting, it's a lovely story.
549000	556000	It's one of the most, most positive and perhaps realistic versions of AI that I've seen out
556000	557000	there.
557000	558000	If you haven't seen her, please go do it.
558000	560000	It's a beautiful construct.
560000	563000	And at the end of the movie, no one spoil it.
563000	564000	Anyway.
564000	565000	Yeah.
565000	569000	But the whole concept of us connecting to machines.
569000	573000	I don't see anything wrong with that, by the way.
573000	578000	I love the idea of being able to connect to a body that can help me learn things and so
578000	579000	on.
579000	580000	It's wonderful.
580000	585000	You know, I think this will shift deeply into erotic experiences and emotional experiences
585000	591000	and romantic experiences where so many people are lonely and they'll use this to replace
591000	594000	an annoying girlfriend or an annoying boyfriend or whatever.
594000	595000	Sadly.
595000	596000	Right.
596000	599000	But I still believe there will be a space for human connection.
599000	600000	Okay.
600000	605000	There will be a space where genuine human connection, the kind that you feel when you meet an old
605000	607000	friend is still going to be very valuable.
607000	612000	And I, and I, as I said, I think this is a skill that's been eroding over the last 10-15
612000	613000	years because of social media.
613000	615000	We need to bring that back to our children.
615000	617000	So that's number two on your list.
617000	618000	Yeah.
618000	619000	That was number two on your list.
619000	625000	Number three is, is sad when I say it, but we need to teach them resilience.
625000	626000	Okay.
626000	629000	And resilience, not just because of AI as a matter of fact.
629000	633000	As I said, I don't know if we said that last time, but I say it repeatedly.
633000	636000	We are at a perfect store.
636000	647000	I mean, if you just think about the world finances and economics, there's never been a better
647000	651000	match in history to the times of the Great Depression than today.
651000	652000	Okay.
652000	659000	So it seems, if you know anything about economics, there is a very deep economic crisis ahead
659000	660000	of us.
660000	661000	Okay.
661000	667000	There is a geopolitical layer on top of the economic crisis that might extenuate it.
667000	668000	Okay.
668000	675000	There is a climate crisis that we're so far only seeing the tip of the iceberg of, you
675000	679000	know, three million people being displaced in Pakistan last year, the Australian fires
679000	680000	and so on and so forth.
680000	686000	When, when in reality, you, you know, anyone with a reasonable ability to look at trends
686000	689000	will tell you, we may get more of these.
689000	690000	Okay.
690000	700000	So resilience seems to me to be a very useful skill and resilience is not training them
700000	703000	what to do when certain things happen.
703000	709000	It's training them to respond to anything that happens.
709000	713000	The happiness equation is the core of that.
713000	720000	And when you think about, I'll just take a couple of minutes to digress a little bit
720000	724000	when you think that happiness is events minus expectations.
724000	725000	Okay.
725000	731000	Then unhappiness is or any negative emotion is when an event misses your expectations.
731000	732000	Okay.
732000	737000	And when an event misses your expectations, your brain sounds the alarm.
737000	738000	Okay.
738000	739000	Oh, he said this.
739000	740500	She, you know, he doesn't love me anymore.
740500	742000	What I think is going right.
742000	743000	Something's going wrong.
743000	746000	Now, we may think of that feeling as an annoying feeling.
746000	751000	It is your brain is sounding the alarm because it is an alarm.
751000	755000	Unhappiness and all of its derivatives is a survival mechanism.
755000	756000	Okay.
756000	762000	It's your brain telling you something in the surrounding environment does not match my
762000	766000	worldview of an optimum scenario for my survival and thriving.
766000	767000	Okay.
767000	771000	And so what happens is your brain is simply saying, we need to do something about this.
771000	777000	Now, resilience in my view is to actually do something about it.
777000	778000	Right.
778000	782000	The resilience in my view is to take it and go through three questions.
782000	784000	I call them the happiness flow chart.
784000	785000	Okay.
785000	788000	Question number one is, is what is what my brain telling me true?
788000	789000	Yes.
789000	790000	Okay.
790000	794000	Because 90% of the time it isn't your brain is telling you what it thinks is true, but
794000	795000	it isn't always the truth.
795000	799000	You may have an argument with your son and then you will say, oh, my son doesn't love
799000	800000	me anymore.
800000	803000	That's, that's, these are two different events.
803000	807000	The event that your brain is telling you is influenced by your fears and your conditioning
807000	808000	and so on and so forth.
808000	809000	Right.
809000	811000	While the actual event is I had an argument with my son.
811000	812000	Right.
812000	814000	So the first question is, is it true?
814000	815000	Okay.
815000	818000	The second question, if it's true, if it's not true, by the way, drop it.
818000	822000	Don't be unhappy about anything that doesn't make you, that is not even true.
822000	823000	Right.
823000	827000	If it is true, the second question is what can I do to fix it?
827000	828000	Okay.
828000	829000	What can I do to fix it?
829000	836000	You know, in today's world, you may tell yourself, I'm about to lose my job because of AI.
836000	838000	Is this true?
838000	839000	Yes, it is.
839000	840000	Okay.
840000	844000	If it is, what can I do to fix that situation?
844000	847000	I can upskill and find another job.
847000	848000	Okay.
848000	853720	I can downscale and move to Dominican Republic and live for a fraction of what I'm spending
853720	854720	in the US.
854720	855720	Right.
855720	856720	Whatever.
856720	858800	That's something you can do to fix that situation.
858800	860440	This is where resilience comes in.
860440	861440	Yes.
861440	862440	Right.
862440	863440	That's exactly what it is.
863440	867600	Now, the third is the Jedi master level of happiness.
867600	870240	The Jedi master level of happiness is quite interesting.
870240	876080	It basically, there are things that you can, that you are faced with that you cannot do
876080	877480	anything to fix.
877480	878480	Right.
878480	883200	So if the answer to the question, what can I do to fix it is nothing like there is an
883200	885040	economic crisis coming.
885040	886040	Okay.
886040	888640	If, you know, what can I do to fix that?
888640	892280	There's nothing within your own power as an individual to stop an economic crisis.
892280	893280	Okay.
893280	897520	So the following question, which I think is the Jedi master level of happiness, the
897520	903360	Jedi master level of resilience is, can I accept it and do something to make my life
903360	904840	better despite its presence?
904840	905840	Okay.
905840	908160	Can I, can I simply tell myself, this is it.
908160	912000	I can't fix an economic crisis coming, but I can take care of my kids and my loved ones
912000	915040	and change my spending habits and sell my car and do this and that.
915040	916040	Okay.
916040	919360	It doesn't make my life amazing, but it makes it better within the current circumstances
919360	920360	that I accepted.
920360	921360	Okay.
921360	924400	So that to me is resilience and happiness combined.
924400	925400	Those three questions.
925400	932680	And I think we need to teach our kids by example to show that level of resilience.
932680	935840	When life doesn't go their way, they need to go, is it true?
935840	937240	Can I do something to fix it?
937240	940040	Can I accept it and make my life better despite its presence?
940040	941040	Hey everybody, this is Peter.
941040	942440	A quick break from the episode.
942440	947360	Now I'm a firm believer that science and technology and how entrepreneurs can change
947360	951960	the world is the only real news out there worth consuming.
951960	954120	I don't watch the crisis news network.
954120	958800	I call CNN or Fox and hear every devastating piece of news on the planet.
958800	965080	I spend my time training my neural net the way I see the world by looking at the incredible
965080	969040	breakthroughs in science and technology and how entrepreneurs are solving the world's
969040	970520	grand challenges.
970520	976000	What the breakthroughs are in longevity, how exponential technologies are transforming
976000	977200	our world.
977200	979480	So twice a week, I put out a blog.
979480	986440	One blog is looking at the future of longevity, age reversal, biotech, increasing your health
986440	987440	span.
987440	993840	The other blog looks at exponential technologies, AI, 3D printing, synthetic biology, AR, VR,
993840	994840	blockchain.
994840	997800	These technologies are transforming what you as an entrepreneur can do.
997800	1001720	If this is the kind of news you want to learn about and shape your neural nets with, go
1001720	1006280	to dmandis.com backslash blog and learn more.
1006280	1007800	Now back to the episode.
1007800	1012720	This comes back to something I speak about a lot and I'm passionate about which is mindsets.
1012720	1014800	Your mindset, our brains are neural nets.
1014800	1019840	They're being shaped constantly by everything we watch, everything we read, the conversations
1019840	1022240	we have, our communities and so forth.
1022240	1025800	And you can have an abundance mindset or scarcity mindset.
1025800	1029480	You can have an optimism mindset or a fear mindset.
1029480	1033640	And just to hit on this a little bit, you know, you said we're in a perfect storm coming
1033640	1040480	of these problems, but the flip side of that as well is, and we have incredible tools more
1040480	1041480	than ever before.
1041480	1042480	Yes, incredible opportunities.
1042480	1043560	That's what rise of it as well.
1043560	1049000	We are about to have AI reinvent global education and healthcare, right?
1049000	1054640	We're going to enable so much that we could not, the challenges of humanity to be addressed
1054640	1055640	and solved.
1056480	1061840	Despite the perfect storm on the negative side, we do have the ability for people to
1061840	1063760	uplift humanity, right?
1063760	1072000	We are going to see, you know, generative AI and AGI help us with curing cancer and low
1072000	1074480	cost fusion energy and all of these things.
1074480	1078800	And it's the balance, it's the potential.
1078800	1080880	Your fourth item.
1080880	1089160	My fourth item is going to be difficult to explain, but I will try as much as I can.
1089160	1097240	Our brains bias at looking at difficult situations and perfect storms is biased to make it look
1097240	1103000	like this is more uncertain than any other moment in your life.
1103000	1109080	So you look at the economy changing and AI rising and climate change and the geopolitical
1109080	1110080	situation.
1110080	1113760	You say, this is very uncertain, okay?
1113760	1117360	Something is likely going to go wrong, okay?
1117360	1122800	The truth is someone like me who loses his child all of a sudden to preventable medical
1122800	1131440	error at a moment of his prime realizes that this actually is the case of life all the
1131440	1132440	time.
1132440	1133440	No guarantees.
1133440	1136480	But we're always in a perfect storm, right?
1136480	1143440	That we are always, as I said earlier, I have no guarantee whatsoever that I will ever
1143440	1145560	see you again, Peter, okay?
1145560	1149040	I might leave the world within two minutes from now.
1149040	1152040	And by the way, it happens all the time.
1152040	1161560	It happens all the time that the world surprises us as a tidal wave or an erupted volcano or
1161560	1166080	someone that you loved so much that you hugged and played tennis with, you know, leaves our
1166080	1169920	world an hour later or whatever, okay?
1169920	1172360	And that's the reality of the video game.
1172360	1178880	The reality of the video game is there is only now.
1178880	1184160	Any real video gamer, I'm a very serious video gamer, by the way, for those of you listening,
1184160	1188120	the one that killed you yesterday is me, okay?
1188120	1189120	Simple as that, right?
1189120	1194160	But every real video gamer, by the way, I'm not addicted at all.
1194160	1199240	I play 45 minutes a day, four times a week, but I'm Olympic champion level, okay?
1199240	1208120	And I will tell you, real gamers, real gamers understand that the game has no state a minute
1208120	1210360	later, okay?
1210360	1214480	When a minute later is rendered on the screen, I will deal with it.
1214480	1218800	And because I'm a very good gamer, I know I'll be able to deal with any challenge that
1218800	1220840	comes a minute later, right?
1220840	1225920	My challenge is this minute, and my joy is this minute.
1225920	1228000	Being present now, yeah.
1228000	1230400	Right here, right now.
1230400	1238400	If life is in a perfect storm, I tell people, live, live, because you know what?
1238400	1241960	You have certainty that today is not a perfect storm yet.
1241960	1246080	You have certainty that your kids are wonderful in your arms today.
1246080	1248480	You have certainty that you're going to have dinner tonight.
1248480	1252320	You have certainty that your battery on your phone is going to last another five minutes
1252320	1255440	to hopefully finish our conversation, okay?
1255440	1259920	When you have those certainties, don't think about what's going to happen when the battery
1259920	1261280	runs out.
1261280	1262480	Think about this minute.
1262480	1266840	How can I savor this minute fully, okay?
1266840	1271920	And I speak sometimes about, again, you don't have to be spiritual to think of those things,
1271920	1275240	but I studied a ton of spiritual techniques, okay?
1275240	1280080	A ton of spiritual teachings, almost everything I could get my hands on.
1280080	1284200	From the Kabbalah, to Islam, to Sufism, to Hinduism, to Buddhism, anything I could find
1284200	1285200	my hands on.
1285200	1286200	And I put my hands on.
1286200	1291240	And I'll tell you openly, every one of them is beautifully full of gold nuggets and beautifully
1291240	1293400	full of crap, okay?
1293400	1298360	And it's quite interesting how some people will say, oh, here is a piece of crap, I'm
1298360	1303680	going to drop the whole book, while in reality, I go like, here is a piece of gold, I'm going
1303680	1306280	to look for another one, okay?
1306280	1309440	The most beautiful of all of them is what Sufism is.
1309440	1315400	Sufism is a sect of Islam originally, but it's now part of a lot of spiritual beliefs
1315400	1322960	where basically they say that the way to live fully is to die before you die, okay?
1322960	1326080	And to die before you die is a very, very interesting definition.
1326080	1333800	It basically assumes that living is a process of associating with the physical, associating
1333800	1340000	with your car, with your ego, with your t-shirt, with your, you know, whatever.
1340000	1345560	And that death is the moment of disconnection with everything physically, okay?
1345560	1352640	And to die before you die is to be alive fully, fully engaged in the game, but not give a
1352640	1356720	shit about losing any of it, okay?
1356720	1362080	And that's a very, again, a video gamer's mentality is to say, I'm going to do this
1362080	1364560	bit, I'm going to do it the best that I can.
1364560	1366200	I'm playing football.
1366200	1368120	I'm fully out there, right?
1368120	1373280	And I'm going to enjoy it fully, but I'm not attached to the result, because the result
1373280	1374880	is bigger than me.
1374880	1380520	And what I think people need to do in the world we live in today is to learn to live.
1380520	1387720	Because when we spoke last time in the AI episode, I told you openly, it is game over
1387720	1389200	for our way of life.
1389200	1394720	The way we live today, five years from now, is going to be nonexistent.
1394720	1397400	How will it change better or worse?
1397400	1400800	That's not the topic, but it's not going to be like it is right now.
1400800	1405960	So when we are here right now and you love this way of life, enjoy the hell out of it.
1405960	1412600	Live it fully, connect to it fully, play the game and enjoy the fun, and prepare yourself
1412600	1417080	by detaching from things that might be taken away from you, okay?
1417080	1420800	Prepare for yourself to get other things that might be given to you.
1420800	1425280	And that kind of flow in life, I know sounds very philosophical.
1425280	1428680	In a world where we're talking economics and politics and so on.
1428680	1434960	But I can tell you that real gamers, when they die, you know, the reason why we gamers
1434960	1439560	play really well is because we have multiple lives in the game, right?
1439560	1443120	So I'm not saying this from a physical, from a spiritual point of view, but I'm saying
1443120	1447840	when you don't care if you're killed in the game, you play full out, okay?
1447840	1449080	And I think that's the idea.
1449080	1455200	The idea is, yes, the future might hold some challenges, learn to live.
1455200	1459640	And if you learn to live, if you learn to flow, if you learn to savor those beautiful
1459640	1462920	moments we have right now, okay?
1463280	1465720	What happens tomorrow doesn't really matter.
1465720	1471800	When tomorrow comes, if you're prepared through that, the three points I said earlier, if
1471800	1475240	you're prepared, hopefully you'll be able to overcome that too.
1475240	1478680	It's interesting because none of those things are what we teach in school today to bring
1478680	1480160	it back to the original question.
1480160	1488040	I'm going to share with you my list that I wrote down and then maybe chat GPT's list.
1488040	1489040	Because I think about this.
1489040	1499160	I think about do we need to reinvent it because I'm clear that the momentum that our school
1499160	1507240	systems have is not going to change until it's forced to change.
1507240	1513120	So what I put on my list is helping our kids, first off, find their purpose and passion.
1513120	1517320	And there's a distinction between purpose and passion, but it is something that I found
1517320	1521200	my purpose and passion early on from Apollo and Star Trek, right?
1521200	1522200	It was opening up space.
1522200	1523200	Yes.
1523200	1524560	It lit my heart on fire.
1524560	1531680	Everything I've ever done is a result of that passion, that dream, to learn on my own.
1531680	1535840	But it can be anything, career out of anything these days, but what is it that lights you
1535840	1538960	on fire and makes you happy and gives you joy?
1538960	1547160	The second thing I put down was the combination of debate, leadership, and asking great questions.
1548160	1552600	When I drop my kids off at school every day, I say, ask great questions, right?
1552600	1560800	Today, it's about prompting chat GPT properly, but it's the questions we ask.
1560800	1564720	I give this advice to CEOs at the same time, ask great questions, and it's the questions
1564720	1570840	that you've never allowed yourself to ask as a child or as a leader.
1570920	1577080	But leadership, and I want to come back to leadership a little bit, helping our kids
1577080	1582160	understand what leadership is and how to lead, how to have a vision, how to connect with
1582160	1585160	individuals.
1585160	1586160	Curiosity, right?
1586160	1592360	I think that's innate in children, in the youngest of children, but we lose it over time.
1592360	1594680	And that goes back to asking great questions.
1594680	1603880	And so, maintaining and creating a curiosity practice, solution-oriented thinking, where
1603880	1611800	the notion is, if there's a problem, rather than focusing on the problem, really do a
1611800	1620240	judo mind trick or a Jedi mind trick to focus on the solution, because there are solutions.
1621240	1626760	Principle thinking, exponential thinking, and then philosophy, which is going to be
1626760	1629040	more valuable than ever before.
1629040	1630040	I believe that.
1630040	1631040	Yeah.
1631040	1638440	When you hear chat GPT, philosophy, in the sense of dealing with the uncertain, really,
1638440	1643680	being able to manage knowledge in the ambiguity of not really knowing.
1643680	1648240	I asked chat GPT, and I said, okay, what are the skills that our kids need to be taught
1648240	1654040	in high school to prepare them for a world of advanced AI?
1654040	1662840	It said adaptability, continuous learning, critical thinking, emotional intelligence,
1662840	1667280	ethical awareness, and resilience.
1667280	1670680	I like the adaptability bit very much, actually.
1670680	1675160	Well, it's going to say, you know, adapt to AI.
1675160	1676160	Listen to your master.
1677080	1683040	But this is a conversation I'm going to be having for a while, which is, what are the
1683040	1687480	skills that are going to prepare our kids?
1687480	1692160	Because they're going to spend a huge amount of time and then be thrust into living on
1692160	1693160	their own.
1693160	1698120	It's this decade that things are changing dramatically.
1698120	1701320	The next three years.
1701320	1703880	You keep on saying next three years versus decade, and you're right.
1703880	1707800	It is the speed of change is thrust.
1707800	1713040	There are tiny little triggers that are beyond repair.
1713040	1720320	So if Imad Moustak, he boldly says no developers in five years.
1720320	1727000	So that if you're the most conservative human on the planet that assumes a 20% job loss in
1727000	1733720	the development landscape every year, imagine if 20% of all the developers you know in
1733720	1737000	California have lost their job every year from now on.
1737000	1742520	That's a very significant redesign of the fabric of society.
1742520	1745240	And I think the reality is it's around the corner.
