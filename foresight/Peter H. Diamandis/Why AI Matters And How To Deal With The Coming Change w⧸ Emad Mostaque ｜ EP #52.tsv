0	3840	By next year, end of the year, I believe you'll have ChatGPT on your mobile phone.
3840	4760	Say that one more time.
4760	8360	By the end of next year, you'll have ChatGPT on your mobile phone without internet.
10160	12080	Today, the world changes.
12080	13880	This is a regime change.
13880	17680	Four of the top 10 apps or apps in December were based on stable diffusion.
17680	20880	41% of all code on GitHub right now is AI generated.
20880	22960	We have figured out how to make humans scale.
22960	25560	So you have this amazing thing that can create anything.
25560	28000	How far out are you able to see?
28040	32160	Can you have a sense of predicting where we are in 10 years?
32160	33480	I can't see past my tears.
33480	37800	There's enough fear and some of it is deserved, but there also needs to be hope.
37800	39240	Humans are humans.
39240	42560	Bring them the information that creates the most value and you will change the world.
46360	49640	I'm excited to share with you one of the most extraordinary conversations
49640	52880	I had at this year's annual Abundance 360 Summit.
53600	57480	It was with a friend, someone I've had on this podcast before,
57480	61800	Imad Moustak, who's the founder and CEO of Stability AI.
61800	66320	You know his company from a number of his products, including stable diffusion.
66320	70520	We sat down to talk about his moonshots to talk about how
70520	72640	generative AI is changing the world.
72640	76720	What do you do if you're a 20-year-old just getting involved?
76720	79840	Or if you're a seasoned CEO or entrepreneur,
79840	84720	and how is this going to change the world of Hollywood education, health care?
84720	87280	You know, it was an incredible conversation.
87280	89120	I'm excited for you to hear.
89120	94560	You know, my mission through this podcast is to help you hear the voices
94560	97760	that are filled with optimism and abundance.
97760	101080	If that's of interest to you, then please subscribe to this podcast.
101080	102400	All right, enjoy the episode.
102400	107440	By the end of this episode, you should have a pretty good idea where you stand on AI.
107440	108480	Are you excited about it?
108480	109840	Are you fearful of it?
109840	110800	I'd love to know.
110800	113720	Feel free to share your stance with me on Twitter.
113720	114200	Hey, pal.
114200	114800	Hey.
114800	116000	How's it going, buddy?
116000	120360	Listen, I know you have so much going on right now.
120360	121320	It's insane.
121320	126680	We're in the midst of the most extraordinary period of technology ever,
126680	128480	and you're in the thick of it.
128480	130080	Yeah, I think, what's it?
130080	132320	A good phrase is, everything ever, all at once?
132320	133320	Yes.
133320	133800	Yeah.
133800	136640	That's basically what it is.
136640	139680	I can't mention the conversations he's been having the last 30 minutes,
139680	142360	but it would blow your mind.
142360	143480	I'm going to give you this clicker.
143480	146440	You have some slides to show.
146440	150200	I think the very first question to ask
150200	155200	is if you were going to bring people up to speed on where we are right now,
155200	158080	would you share some of what your thoughts are here?
158080	160960	We have figured out how to make human scale.
160960	163400	How do you make human scale?
163400	165800	That's the most difficult thing.
165800	169800	Basically, classical AI was all about taking stuff and extrapolating it.
169840	173920	We figured out how to figure out principles and latent knowledge
173920	177160	with huge compression in these files, as we all talk about in a bit.
177160	181560	The most valuable thing you can have is a good EA or a really good analyst.
181560	183400	I have asked her if she's amazing.
183400	184360	It makes such a difference.
184360	186920	I'm sure all of you in this audience will realize that.
186920	188160	We now have that.
188160	192160	Basically, what we've done is we've trained these things on huge amounts of data
192160	195200	to understand principles, and now when you use a GPT-4,
195200	198840	it's like a really talented intern analyst with a bad memory,
198880	200880	and we're about to fix the memory.
200880	205120	It knows how to pass the medical bar exam or medical licensing and others.
205120	209640	It knows how to draw beautiful pictures or create audio of any type,
209640	212320	and it's basically available to everyone for pennies.
212320	214040	That's a great thing. What does that mean?
214040	216080	It can mean huge disruption,
216080	220600	or it can mean basically we're at the point of utopia and abundance.
220600	224440	If you don't mind, people know stable diffusion,
224440	229800	and you'll show them the chart that really rocked me when I first saw it.
229800	235680	But what are the wide range of things that Stability AI is working on right now?
235680	237040	Where do you want to go?
238400	240000	Can you tell us about it, please?
240000	241000	No, I can tell you.
241000	246200	My aim is to provide the building blocks for a society OS.
246200	250080	Every part of society, if you have skilled experts in them,
251080	254520	our mission is to build the foundation to activate human entities' potential.
254520	257320	Across every single modality, we're building models,
257320	263560	so audio, video, protein folding, DNA, chemical reactions, language, and others.
263560	267120	We're doing it for every sector, so you've got a bank of GPT, a board GPT,
267120	269720	to replace all your crap board members,
269720	272080	all the way down to national models.
272080	275720	We're doing an Indian national model at the moment, an Indonesian one, a Japanese one,
276160	281080	so that everyone can have a file that they put words in,
281080	285600	and images, audio, text, anything pops out that's appropriate to you to enhance you.
285600	289240	So I want to click on that one because it's very important.
289240	292720	People talk about biases in the system,
292720	296920	but what you're talking about is creating what you're calling a foundational model
296920	301400	that is biased to you, or to your company, or your country.
301400	302040	Yes?
302040	305120	The existing internet has centralized artificial intelligence
305120	309880	that guides our attention, our memorization, where we go.
309880	313040	With this technology, we can push internet intelligence to the edge,
313040	317720	so every single person, country, culture, company can have their own AIs.
317720	321400	And that's an amazing thing because it can work for you, not against you.
321400	324800	And so that's the personalization because what is bias, right?
324800	327200	There are inherent biases in our society and things,
327200	328760	but we can never move fast on this thing.
328760	331760	We can't move fast enough to address them.
331760	333200	But then what if you could have your own stories?
333240	334440	Everyone here has a story.
334440	337400	Your members of A360, you believe in abundance.
337400	339680	There's a whole variety of things that make us who we are.
339680	343360	Have the AI respond to your own story and work for you.
343360	345240	And I think that's the intelligent internet
345240	347160	and that's the amazing future we have coming.
347160	347840	That is.
347840	352560	And you built Stability AI as an open platform,
352560	354920	which is very different from everybody else.
354920	356800	I mean, it's interesting, right?
356800	358920	OpenAI has that name.
358920	362080	And very funny, if you go to OpenAI.com,
362120	364240	it doesn't go to OpenAI, it goes to stable.
364240	365640	Well, actually, open.ai here.
365640	366800	Open.ai, sorry.
366800	368040	Yeah.
368040	369200	Which is pretty funny.
369200	374920	So inappropriate because you are the open AI platform.
374920	375280	We are.
375280	377880	I mean, actually, openai.com also works.
377880	380880	But yeah, I mean, basically where we were
380880	385000	was that we had this explosion of research.
385000	386400	Look at this is, again, exponential,
386400	389280	literal exponential of the amount of ML research that occurred.
389280	391280	And we were like, let's build a generalized intelligence.
391280	394080	When OpenAI and others started, we didn't know how to do it.
394080	395960	And then we found this one thing called a transformer
395960	397680	that pays attention to the important things.
397680	399160	Like, you guys are paying attention
399160	401240	to the important things that we're saying right now,
401240	403240	as opposed to just treating everything the same.
403240	405440	And it figured out that we could scale it with these GPUs,
405440	407400	like, gigantic supercomputers.
407400	408920	They didn't really know exactly how to do it,
408920	411320	so they just kept on adding more and more supercomputers.
411320	411920	And we've got a lot.
411920	414840	Like, our supercomputer is 10 times faster than NASA's, right?
414840	417400	Our new supercomputer is 10 times faster than that.
417400	419640	So again, exponential.
419680	423920	But then they thought this solves everything, scale solves everything.
423920	426080	But have you ever seen a generalized system
426080	428120	that outperforms a specialized system?
428120	429120	No.
429120	430760	But that means you have to give people the tools
430760	432480	to make it a specialized system.
432480	435800	You're never going to send all your internal company data
435800	437720	to chat GPT or GPT-4.
437720	439600	So that's an interesting point.
439600	441880	And I don't know if I heard it from you or elsewhere,
441880	444120	where some of the banks and large corporations
444120	448080	are not sending their data and allowing employees
448120	449960	to use chat GPT.
449960	451720	They don't want Microsoft having access to it.
451720	452720	So what's the alternative?
452720	453920	How do you go around that?
453920	455960	We have the most popular language models in the world,
455960	458320	GPT-J, Neo-NX, 25 million downloads.
458320	461840	We're about to release our next generation open source models.
461840	462880	Again, base models.
462880	464760	And then you'll have the banker, board versions,
464760	465760	Indian versions.
465760	468240	So I get to use it on my own system
468240	469600	that no one else has access to.
469600	472600	You get to go, is it via Amazon, Google, Intel, anyone?
472600	475280	On-prem, in your cloud, you own it.
475280	477160	Again, it's like you basically.
477160	478880	It's like actually one thing.
478880	483280	It's like, again, these are like very talented analysts.
483280	485920	Getting an analyst on secondment from Microsoft,
485920	489520	he goes back to Microsoft versus hiring your own analyst.
489520	490600	These are the two modalities.
490600	493240	So you'll have these big private proprietary models
493240	494360	where there's lots of secret sources.
494360	496440	They have these open interpretable models
496440	499480	where you see how the cookie is made, as it were,
499480	500800	that you own.
500800	503280	And I think the latter is far more powerful than the former
503280	505240	because you don't need a model that does everything then.
505240	508800	You give people the tools they need and the ownership
508800	512200	to create their own experiences and accelerate themselves.
512200	514320	Let me ask you, we're all here to understand
514320	515720	where this is going.
515720	518120	How far out are you able to see?
518120	520720	Can you have a sense of predicting where we are
520720	523360	in 10 years, five years?
523360	524920	I can't see past five years.
524920	525920	You can't see past five years.
525920	528200	No, because by next year, end of the year,
528200	530680	I believe you'll have chat GPT on your mobile phone.
530680	531600	Say that one more time.
531600	533480	By the end of next year, you'll have chat GPT
533480	535520	on your mobile phone without internet.
535520	536000	Wow.
536000	542560	So we're talking about a stability chat, right?
542560	543360	Yeah, a stable chat.
543360	546280	Stable chat, let's name it properly.
546280	548640	So incredible because you've talked
548640	550920	about taking how many terabytes of data
550920	552440	down to a couple of gigabytes.
552440	555720	So like, actually, this is probably one thing
555720	557160	that I wanted to talk about quickly.
557160	559240	Please, yeah.
559240	561040	The easiest way for us to communicate
561040	562640	has been speech is what we're doing now.
562640	564720	Text has been harder, but you've seen with chat GPT,
564720	565240	it's not easy.
565240	567760	You just ask it to rewrite your kind of emails.
567760	569400	And with Office 365 and Workspace,
569400	571400	we'll do that, and Visual was the hardest.
571400	573480	These have all been flattened by this technology now,
573480	574960	so we can communicate anything.
574960	577880	But the technology behind it, as you said, was a bit crazy.
577880	579880	To do this, what we did, so stable diffusion
579880	581680	was our text-to-image model.
581680	583720	We were like, do we do it big and do loads of layers,
583720	585240	or do we make it accessible?
585240	587040	And we were like, accessible.
587040	589120	So we worked super hard Manhattan project,
589120	592880	and we took 100,000 gigabytes of images, 2 billion,
592880	595280	and created a 2-gigabyte file that can generate anything.
595280	597920	OK, let's slow that down, because the meaning of that
597920	600080	is insane.
600080	602240	How many terabytes was it?
602240	607560	It was 0.1, 100 terabytes, 100,000 gigabytes,
607560	611520	and the output was a 2-gigabyte file that can create anything.
611520	616720	And that 2 gigabytes sits on your phone, your laptop,
616720	617560	in your brain.
617560	618480	It was the whole stack.
618480	620600	So intelligence is compression.
620600	622640	You're going to go away from this event,
622640	625000	and you're going to compress the things that you learn
625000	626640	and have to take away.
626640	629240	That's what we do, and that's what these machines do now.
629240	630480	But again, it's a single file.
630480	633000	Four of the top 10 app store apps in December
633000	634840	were based on stable diffusion.
634840	639880	And it was the entire stack, a single file of weights,
639880	640840	of numbers.
640840	642200	That's extraordinary.
642200	644600	Words go in, images come out.
644600	645640	And it's the same.
645640	648000	ChatGPT is a single file, actually, it's a couple files.
648000	649760	So this is a single file.
649760	654960	Words go in, code comes out, amazing essays come out.
654960	656320	So this is something a bit different.
656320	657920	And again, it's like, again, you've
657920	660640	taught an analyst just about everything,
660640	663200	or as an artist, the analyst, and things like that.
663200	666320	I think we'll get it down to 100 megabytes.
666320	668600	And it went insane, because we made it like that.
668600	672600	So this is what you texted me, and I said, huh?
672600	677160	So a lot of us were doing Web 3, and we were all developers.
677160	679360	Developers are cool, right?
679360	681720	In three months, we ever took Bitcoin and Ethereum
681720	683280	and developed for popularity.
683280	686040	So on the bottom here is the years.
686040	692920	And on the Y axis here is the number of GitHub developers.
692920	695080	GitHub stars, yeah, developers who love it.
695080	700360	And so when you sent me that, I thought that was the axis line.
700360	701280	Yeah.
701280	703280	So cumulatively, the whole ecosystem
703280	705520	built around this thing, which is a bit like a game engine,
705560	707240	has overtaken Linux.
707240	711000	Again, Linux 20 years this five months,
711000	713440	because we gave it to everyone, and it runs on your MacBook
713440	716080	or your iPhone without internet.
716080	719480	So you have this amazing thing that can create anything.
719480	722200	I think that's profound, right?
722200	726360	So we've seen the speed, profound indeed.
726360	729560	We've seen the speed just explode.
729560	731480	Can we expect it to get faster and faster?
731480	732640	Yeah, I think you can.
732640	734840	So look, words go in, images come out.
734840	737960	A lot of you have kind of seen this, you can generate anything.
737960	741320	But since the release in August, we've sped up 100 times.
741320	743840	Well, we've gone from six seconds in image
743840	746360	to 60 images a second.
746360	748440	And the quality has improved, and basically the next version
748440	749680	is photorealistic.
749680	753000	So 60 images per second is like video?
753000	754640	Yeah, we pretty much got video.
754640	756880	So my question is, is Hollywood scared shitless,
756880	758080	or are they excited?
758080	758760	They're scared.
758760	759600	It's a mixture.
759600	761080	There's a few people who are scared shitless,
761080	763280	and we'll talk about some of the stuff coming down the pipeline
763280	765600	later, because, you know, Preetr and I had a discussion,
765600	767760	like, should we scare everyone shitless completely,
767760	769200	or should we kind of do hope?
769200	770600	And so I'm going to do hope, actually.
770600	772240	I think I'm going to focus on this.
772240	774920	This is the most disruptive thing ever, because, again, humans
774920	776800	can scale, so you don't need as many humans.
776800	779000	There was an MIT study, I think, I'll send it to you,
779000	780040	which just came out.
780040	783200	It showed that, basically, the third to the seventh
783200	785880	decile got, like, 30% better.
785880	788160	The top 5% got orders of magnitude better,
788160	790720	or multiples better, with this technology.
790720	792880	And so it lifts humanity and the ability
792880	794200	to communicate and do things.
794200	797600	So this is the hopeful future that we share,
797600	801560	and the abundance mindset that I think
801560	803320	is really important for people to take away.
803320	807040	There's enough fear, and some of it is deserved,
807040	808640	but there also needs to be hope.
808640	811280	I think we always have to look at the unchanging
811280	813120	between versus the inevitable.
813120	816520	So an inevitable is 41% of all code on GitHub right now
816520	817640	is AI generated.
817640	818840	Wow.
818840	820400	To six months.
820400	823760	Which at GPT can pass a GLU level 3 programmer exam,
823760	826440	and it will run pretty much on a MacBook or a phone.
826440	827320	And that's this year.
827320	828080	This year, right now.
828080	829120	Yeah.
829120	831040	There are no programmers in five years.
831040	833640	No programmers in five years.
833640	836160	So those of you with kids who you are having,
836160	838920	you know, with Python lessons and so forth,
838920	842640	maybe it's instead helping them to understand
842640	845480	how to ask great questions or give great directions or prompts.
845480	847720	Yeah, like with this, this is a technological marvel
847720	850160	that we've sped up 100 times, because we have amazing developers,
850160	852680	and we have communities of hundreds of thousands.
852680	856960	I went to GPT4, and I said, help me write some code
856960	859360	to change the nature of inference
859360	862400	to something called int8 to int4, which is only a year old,
862400	864360	so it's not in the data set.
864360	865640	And it figured it out, and it worked.
865640	866120	It figured it out.
866120	866520	Awesome.
866520	867080	Straight out.
867080	869240	I asked it to create asteroids in D3.
869240	869720	I love asteroids.
869720	870600	We're the high school thing.
870600	870840	Yeah.
870840	873480	And I copy-pasted it, and it worked the game straight out.
873480	874920	So again, we have to kind of think about this,
874920	876440	and we have to think, but what can you do?
876440	878360	Well, the answer is you can do anything now.
878400	882080	Because a lot of the stuff that blocks you isn't there anymore.
882080	884200	Any of you can now be creative.
884200	887480	Any of you can now build systems.
887480	889960	And so you build the systems that adhere
889960	893680	to the unchanging demands of people to make their lives better.
893680	896440	And that's value, and they'll pay you for that value.
896440	899280	We're all creators, and we're, in fact,
899280	902200	we had Will I Am last night at our patron dinner,
902200	907920	who's this incredible creative energy across all modalities.
907920	910960	And all of a sudden, you're not restricted by what
910960	912760	you learned in school.
912760	915640	You can bring the best to anything you desire.
915640	916600	It's the best to anything done.
916600	917440	You can control it.
917440	919520	So you can just say, take something
919520	922880	and change it to its original form, like this.
922880	925040	From mindset to materialization.
925040	927560	Which version of you do you like best?
927560	928320	Exactly.
928320	929600	And this is just with words.
929600	930480	There's no more prompts.
930480	933200	I just say, I want to change it to this or that.
933200	937360	And it happens instantly now with a new version.
938000	940280	You can say, let's do dynamic adaptation.
940280	942000	Again, it happens in one second.
942000	944960	You generate all of these variants.
944960	946240	And you don't need those prompts.
946240	948280	People say, there's all these magical spells.
948280	948880	You don't say that.
948880	952160	You say, I want to turn Woody into a still from a Western,
952160	954160	or a place of fruit with cake.
954160	955560	So it also becomes more natural.
955560	957840	What are interfaces in the future?
957840	958920	Interfaces are nothing.
958920	961080	It's all about human extension.
961080	963120	And it's about information theories
963120	964320	at the core of all computer science.
964320	966360	Information is valuable in as much
966360	967880	as it changes the state.
967880	970760	Now we finally have a friend to be with us all the time
970760	972560	that can bring us the most valuable information
972560	974040	and the most valuable state changes.
974040	977480	You're a 20-year-old on our Zoom audience here,
977480	979280	or in the room, or 23-year-old.
979280	983040	And you're trying to decide what to do now.
983040	984560	What is your advice?
984560	986360	You just throw yourself 100% into this.
986360	989280	It's the biggest change in society ever.
989280	991400	It will be more disruptive than the pandemic
991400	992320	in the next year or so.
992320	995680	And I led the United Nations AI Initiative against COVID-19,
995720	998360	Kayak, helping organize the world's COVID knowledge
998360	1000160	and making it accessible and useful.
1000160	1001400	So I saw that coming.
1002440	1004320	It'll be for positive and negative,
1004320	1006200	because you can do things that can never be heard of.
1006200	1009320	As an example, we have an upscaler.
1009320	1012840	It goes from 128 pixels to 4K in 1.5 seconds.
1014040	1014880	That to that.
1015720	1016560	That's amazing.
1016560	1018600	What can you do with that?
1018600	1019440	This is the thing.
1019440	1021400	You are given now the recipes and tools.
1021400	1022800	What can you do?
1022800	1025120	So there's gonna be a thousand companies
1025120	1027080	spending $10 million each this year.
1027080	1029120	I spoke to one of the big four accounting firms.
1029120	1030400	They were like, do we need auditors anymore?
1030400	1032080	I'm like, probably not as many.
1033280	1034120	All right?
1034120	1034960	And then they said, okay,
1034960	1037600	we're gonna spend $300 million in the next two quarters
1037600	1039520	trying to figure this out.
1039520	1042680	But that's times many, many firms.
1042680	1044560	Everything everywhere, all at once.
1044560	1045920	And again, this is the emeticness.
1045920	1047160	We've seen this type of thing happen
1047160	1049680	like with the Silicon Valley Bank collapse.
1049680	1051120	Society's become more and more connected.
1051120	1052560	And we've talked about expert systems.
1052560	1054640	How long have we talked about expert systems for?
1054640	1055480	Yeah, a bit.
1055480	1056320	Yolks.
1056320	1057840	They're here now, right?
1057840	1061000	And again, this is why you can do these crazy things.
1061000	1062840	Like, why don't you create your own studio?
1062840	1065360	So, how do we play this?
1065360	1066600	We play this video.
1066600	1068960	You speak and it magically happens.
1068960	1070120	Play.
1070120	1070960	There you go.
1071840	1073680	This is a video of rock, paper, scissors
1073680	1075880	that was done using our technology by two guys
1075880	1077240	in like four days.
1077240	1078640	And it's a whole seven minute video
1078640	1080000	at this level of quality.
1081280	1082280	That's all you need.
1082280	1084440	So why not create amazing kind of videos
1084440	1085680	and things like that?
1085680	1087360	But we're gonna get to a point soon enough
1087360	1089080	and I'll ask for your prediction where I can say,
1089080	1093320	I want a movie about this theme, 90 minutes long,
1093320	1095740	starring my favorite stars.
1096920	1098680	How, when do we see that?
1098680	1099680	That's why it's a movie.
1099680	1101600	I think you get there in the next couple of years.
1101600	1102960	Like rock, paper, scissors too.
1102960	1104400	Again, look it up on Google.
1104400	1106760	We'll be five times as fast.
1106760	1108920	The next version will be fully generated
1108920	1110400	by putting a script in.
1110400	1112160	I mean, like this one, if you press play
1112160	1113320	and it automatically generates
1113320	1114320	a loop music lyric video.
1114320	1115840	So unfortunately we don't have sound,
1115840	1118600	but you can go on Deep Floyd AI on Twitter and see it.
1118600	1121640	Automatically generated kind of this music lyric video.
1123120	1124400	Just from a song input
1124400	1126960	with the entire kind of style of this as well.
1126960	1128680	So everyone here is a filmmaker.
1128680	1130720	I mean, for me, we have a common passion
1130720	1133240	in disrupting and reinventing education.
1134240	1137920	Where I can have in a virtual world,
1137920	1139640	learn about anything I want,
1139680	1143600	a time machine to go and have my favorite characters
1143600	1145640	teaching me about what anything I need.
1146680	1148160	And that's two years away.
1148160	1150200	Yeah, I mean, that actually might be here right now.
1150200	1152000	I mean, again, kind of you've seen glasses,
1152000	1155000	three 3D displays and all sorts of crazy things.
1155000	1157800	But one of the things with this is contextualization.
1157800	1159160	Because again, we are the stories we make.
1159160	1160880	So one of the things we're working on that's quite fun
1160880	1165400	is can you remake Game of Thrones as a J-Drama from Korea?
1166760	1169440	So you're going to end the character's turn Korean, right?
1169680	1172160	I'm also trying to get George R.R. Martin and H.V.O.
1172160	1174240	to let me remake Game of Thrones season eight,
1174240	1175560	because it was terrible.
1178080	1179800	Yeah, and actually it's very interesting why.
1179800	1181920	Because Game of Thrones season one to seven,
1181920	1184600	everyone had agency and the meaning was in the interaction
1184600	1186720	between our stories or the characters.
1186720	1188440	Whereas the last one tried to get us to an ending
1188440	1190200	and so it felt so disjointed.
1190200	1191480	So I'm like, I'll help you write your book.
1191480	1193240	We have the script writing AI coming out
1193240	1194920	and a book writing AI coming out.
1194920	1196240	And so we can tell better stories
1196240	1197560	that are more empathetic and engaging.
1197560	1200160	Because again, this is more engaging for the thing.
1200160	1202280	You can customize your thing everywhere.
1203440	1205400	You can customize to every learner.
1205400	1206360	How crazy is that?
1206360	1207200	And there's even crazy.
1207200	1209120	All at once, a brand new theme.
1209120	1211720	Iman, let's imagine you're in the audience here,
1211720	1214920	you're a business owner, entrepreneur, CEO,
1214920	1219920	and what do you do next?
1219920	1220960	I think what you have to do next again
1220960	1221800	is kind of what you said.
1221800	1223120	You need to have a dedicated,
1223120	1224440	there's nothing more important
1224440	1226160	in your entire business than this.
1226160	1227000	Yeah.
1227200	1229400	So I want to echo that, right?
1229400	1231520	Today, the world changes.
1231520	1232920	Electricity is made available,
1232920	1234640	the telephone is made available,
1234640	1235800	the internet is made available,
1235800	1239560	and this is all of those things together,
1239560	1240600	all at once everywhere.
1240600	1241840	Yeah, this is 5G.
1241840	1243120	This is bigger than 5G.
1243120	1244640	Over a trillion dollars went to 5G,
1244640	1245840	more will go into here.
1245840	1246800	Actually, I'll give you an example,
1246800	1248640	because again, it's always the unchanging
1248640	1250600	versus the inevitable, right?
1250600	1253440	I gave the whole of stability AI
1253440	1254480	the week off at the end of the year,
1254480	1256000	because I was like, holy crap, you're doing a lot, right?
1256000	1257160	Because we do everything, right?
1257160	1259600	And we do it with, we only have 150 people,
1259600	1260840	yet we do every modality
1260840	1262320	because we have the power of community
1262320	1265200	and open behind us, setting the standard.
1265200	1266440	So I give the whole team the week off,
1266440	1269480	said go to sleep, turned off all the things,
1269480	1271480	because you're all going to die
1271480	1272920	if you don't get some rest.
1272920	1274640	So of course, business side of covered that.
1274640	1276640	Stability AI CEO, I'm Adam Mostak,
1276640	1277480	compared to Open AI,
1277480	1279440	it says you're all going to die in 2023.
1281440	1282240	What are we doing?
1282240	1283680	We might be make press as well.
1283680	1284520	What can I say?
1285520	1287960	But then what happened is I was just chilling
1287960	1291480	and I got like five calls from headmasters of UK schools.
1292640	1294840	Emma, what's our generative AI strategy?
1294840	1297040	I was like, what?
1297040	1301040	All our children are using chat GPT to do their homework essays.
1301040	1304280	I was like, don't set homework essays, get good.
1304280	1306600	So again, homework is never the same
1306600	1308680	for every teacher all at once.
1308680	1309680	And so you have to look at your industry
1309680	1310960	and again, what will not be the same
1310960	1313400	when you have the ability to scale humans?
1313440	1315600	This is the question that you have to ask yourself.
1315600	1318960	Like an eaten now, a bastion of British education,
1318960	1321720	they do their essays live by hand,
1321720	1322680	because I told them to do that,
1322680	1323640	because I went to Westminster,
1323640	1325160	who I told to embrace the technology.
1326160	1328000	It arrived at me, right?
1328000	1329360	So again, it says Peter says,
1329360	1330800	there will only be companies that embrace AI
1330800	1332000	and those who don't.
1332000	1333160	I think the way that it pays out,
1333160	1334880	because I was a hedge fund manager,
1334880	1336880	invested tens of billions of dollars,
1336880	1338960	you know, like I understand markets as well,
1338960	1343160	is that if you are in something that's a SaaS company,
1343240	1344760	you're gonna have to really think hard,
1344760	1347720	because GPT-4, for example,
1347720	1349240	and again, we'll have our equivalent of that,
1349240	1350320	but we're taking a different approach
1350320	1352360	of swarm intelligence versus general,
1352360	1355840	has a 32,000 token context window,
1355840	1359640	which means you can feed it 20,000 words of instructions.
1359640	1361480	Well, what is OpenAI at right now?
1361480	1363120	That's their one, GPT-4.
1363120	1364960	The one that they, OpenAI is the best language.
1364960	1366760	And all you should use OpenAI,
1366760	1368560	and you should use our models coming up as well,
1368560	1372240	private data and general data, hybrid AI, you know?
1372240	1375120	But that means you can basically tell it all of HR
1375120	1376720	instructions for something like Workday.
1376720	1378160	What does Workday do then?
1379240	1382160	Because it can be replaced by a single 200 megabyte file.
1382160	1384120	Which you can query on your laptop or your phone.
1384120	1385920	Well, yeah, eventually, but not now,
1385920	1387040	but it just doesn't matter.
1387040	1388840	It costs like $2 for query, right?
1388840	1389680	Right.
1389680	1390800	I mean, it's insane.
1390800	1391960	So, but then you have to think,
1391960	1393240	if you're in a regulated industry,
1393240	1394640	how's super normal margins?
1395600	1397440	You know, if you're in a creative industry,
1397440	1399640	again, you can basically either embrace it
1399640	1402400	to have higher revenue, cheaper costs, or not.
1402400	1403400	Like I give you an example,
1403400	1407680	one of our movie directors did a film,
1407680	1409200	who actually, I can't give you an example.
1409200	1410320	Let's just say millions of dollars
1410320	1413040	are being saved at the moment using this technology.
1413040	1414800	And again, you just have to really think through it.
1414800	1417320	So, going back to our audience here,
1417320	1419760	who, you know, use technology,
1419760	1423560	but don't have AI embedded in their DNA.
1423560	1426600	I've shared the idea of having a chief AI officer
1426600	1428160	who's really a strategist for you,
1428160	1430480	because you're not building your own AIs,
1430480	1433640	you're deciding which platforms to use, right?
1433640	1434480	Yeah.
1434480	1436720	And again, a very few companies will build their own AI.
1436720	1438440	So, I think it'll just be Google, Microsoft,
1438440	1440560	OpenAI, and us that build the foundation models
1440560	1442600	that everyone uses, because you don't need to.
1442600	1444080	Because again, it's like,
1444080	1446160	where the university is churning out
1446160	1448800	the most amazing graduates, effectively.
1448800	1450160	You know, some of them you can borrow,
1450160	1452000	and they're specialized by those guys,
1452000	1454120	and some of them you can hire yourself,
1454120	1456880	through your GPUs, or kind of whatever.
1456880	1459040	My suggestion is that that, what's the,
1459040	1461280	but the thing is, how do you find that person?
1461280	1462120	Hmm.
1462120	1463720	You know, and until they're an AI.
1463720	1464840	No, how do you find that person?
1464840	1465680	Advice?
1465680	1467360	The advice is, you need to first find someone
1467360	1470160	who's passionate about this, because this is so new.
1470160	1471760	So, one of the things that makes us different
1471760	1473360	is that we're a community-based organization.
1473360	1474960	We came out of a community.
1474960	1477520	So, we have developers, one of them was an Amazon warehouse
1477520	1479440	worker last year, and taught himself how to code.
1479440	1480280	Nice.
1480280	1482120	Another one's a 19-year-old, 50-year PhD
1482120	1484000	with three graduate degrees, you know?
1484000	1486600	It'll be clear, it's not gonna be the person
1486680	1489160	who is traditionally the person you would think about.
1489160	1490320	It is driven by passion.
1490320	1491160	It's driven by passion.
1491160	1493520	Everyone here understands the importance of passion,
1493520	1494640	and passion is what you need for this,
1494640	1497160	because this is a regime change.
1497160	1499160	It is not more of what came before.
1499160	1500480	So, you have to throw yourself in it,
1500480	1503240	and have that flexibility of mind.
1503240	1504680	And the key thing is, can it bring you
1504680	1507120	what the next thing is for your industry?
1507120	1508120	You know?
1508120	1510920	Everybody, this is Peter, a quick break from the episode.
1510920	1514000	I'm a firm believer that science and technology,
1514000	1516680	and how entrepreneurs can change the world,
1516680	1520000	is the only real news out there worth consuming.
1520000	1522160	I don't watch the Crisis News Network.
1522160	1525520	I call CNN or Fox, and hear every devastating piece
1525520	1526880	of news on the planet.
1526880	1529960	I spend my time training my neural net,
1529960	1531480	the way I see the world,
1531480	1534400	by looking at the incredible breakthroughs in science
1534400	1536160	and technology, and how entrepreneurs
1536160	1538400	are solving the world's grand challenges,
1538400	1541200	what the breakthroughs are in longevity,
1541200	1545120	how exponential technologies are transforming our world.
1545120	1547400	So, twice a week, I put out a blog.
1547400	1550720	One blog is looking at the future of longevity,
1550720	1554960	age reversal, biotech, increasing your health span.
1554960	1559080	The other blog looks at exponential technologies, AI,
1559080	1562440	3D printing, synthetic biology, AR, VR, blockchain.
1562440	1564120	These technologies are transforming
1564120	1565720	what you as an entrepreneur can do.
1565720	1567800	If this is the kind of news you wanna learn about,
1567800	1569600	and shape your neural nets with,
1569640	1574200	go to dmandis.com, backslash blog, and learn more.
1574200	1575640	Now, back to the episode.
1575640	1578480	We share a moonshot in education.
1578480	1581080	I've had the ability to support, to some degree,
1581080	1582360	what you're doing.
1582360	1585640	Just chat one second about your vision on Malawi.
1585640	1589080	Yeah, so, you know, X Prize for Learning,
1589080	1591760	fantastic prize by Tony, who's here next week tomorrow,
1591760	1593760	I think, and then Elon Musk.
1593760	1594600	Yeah.
1594600	1596280	For the first app that could teach literacy and numeracy
1596280	1598840	in 18 months without internet.
1598880	1600600	We've been deploying that into refugee camps,
1600600	1602520	the winner of that, all around the world,
1602520	1604560	from Rohingya to Malawi to Kenya,
1604560	1608520	and we're teaching 76% of kids literacy and numeracy
1608520	1610680	in one hour a day in 13 months,
1610680	1613480	in the worst places in the world with adaptive learning.
1613480	1614960	Yeah, let's give it up for this.
1614960	1615800	Yeah.
1618800	1622800	That's been the core of Elon's passion and moonshot,
1622800	1624320	but he's taking it a step further.
1624320	1627440	Taking it a step further, because by doing that,
1627480	1628880	this is without this AI.
1629800	1631720	So we work with the Malawi in government,
1631720	1633280	as the first, for example,
1633280	1635320	we're feeding 30% of all the kids in Malawi,
1635320	1637960	we're gonna go to 100% and give every child in Malawi
1637960	1639160	their own AI.
1639160	1640280	I wanna call it one AI for a child,
1640280	1641440	but I've been told not to.
1642440	1645040	And that's kind of what our charity Imagine Worldwide,
1645040	1646680	but then we've built a special type of bond
1646680	1647920	with the World Bank and UBS,
1647920	1649480	whereby you put down $20 million,
1649480	1652360	you only pay if a million kids are provably educated.
1653640	1655320	And so we're gonna use that,
1655320	1656440	and the World Bank pays up front,
1656440	1657640	and then you can have it in your pension fund
1657640	1659200	and see how a million kids are doing.
1659200	1660840	We're gonna use that to scale these tablets,
1660840	1662480	plus high-speed internet in every school,
1662480	1664520	to every child across Africa.
1664520	1666160	Nine out of 10 kids in Africa
1666160	1668640	cannot read and write a sentence by the age of 10.
1668640	1670880	What happens when they all have their own AI
1670880	1671920	that works for them,
1671920	1674440	that's in as intelligent as chat GPT,
1674440	1676200	and healthcare on that tablet?
1676200	1677040	Yes.
1677040	1679280	The AI teaches the kids, learns from the kids,
1679280	1681120	and that will also create the national models
1681120	1682280	for every country.
1682280	1684080	Right now, we hold the eyes open of the AI,
1684080	1685480	and we teach the whole internet,
1685520	1688480	which is why it goes a bit crazy, you know?
1688480	1689760	And again, we use reinforcement learning
1689760	1690800	and other things to guide it.
1690800	1691960	This will be different.
1691960	1694640	So that technology scales.
1694640	1696880	Again, there's nothing more as impactful
1696880	1698000	as one-to-one tuition,
1698000	1699920	and now we can do it in an empathetic way
1699920	1701400	that adapts to each child.
1701400	1703120	I believe that we can also address things
1703120	1704280	like dyslexia and other things,
1704280	1706240	so it's just information processing.
1706240	1707240	And you will see that coming.
1707240	1709440	We're doing a big drive towards that.
1709440	1712040	Any information processing issues will be solved by this.
1712040	1713720	Are you an auditory learner, visual learner?
1713720	1714760	There are no more interfaces.
1714760	1716360	So it's completely customized learning
1716360	1717480	for the individual,
1717480	1719320	their favorite color sports star,
1719320	1720640	way of learning modality,
1720640	1723880	knows exactly where they are and where they need to go.
1723880	1726640	Building the foundation to activate humanity's potential.
1726640	1729600	And so we're gonna open source on new language models
1729600	1731520	in our next month,
1731520	1734480	and then we're gonna announce the next generation of this.
1734480	1737160	An open model for all of the world
1737160	1738720	that you deserve for education and health
1738720	1741240	and other things, because humans are humans.
1741240	1743480	Bring them the information that creates the most value
1743480	1745000	and you will change the world.
1746280	1749560	Is this gonna revolutionize healthcare to the point of...
1749560	1751560	Yes, let's give it up for Imad on that one, yes?
1751560	1752400	Yes.
1752400	1753240	Yes.
1756240	1757840	You got just two minutes left here, health,
1757840	1759240	and then you're coming back to the Q&A,
1759240	1760120	which will be the fun part,
1760120	1762080	because the audience gets to participate.
1763280	1765320	I've always talked about the best diagnosticians,
1765320	1767560	the best healthcare is gonna be AI,
1767560	1769400	which is gonna level the playing field,
1769400	1771480	the poorest child, the wealthiest child,
1771480	1774120	at the same level across the board, yes?
1774120	1775560	Humans are humans.
1775560	1777320	This is why I kind of did the Kayak project,
1777320	1778160	lots of years ago.
1778160	1779600	What a great advantage that is.
1779600	1783120	It's a huge advantage, and again, this is the thing.
1783120	1785680	This is the great equalizer, or it's the great controller,
1785680	1788040	which is why I'm open versus closed.
1788040	1789960	This cannot be controlled by any entity.
1789960	1791560	We have to distribute this,
1791560	1793520	because I believe this is a human right,
1793520	1795920	because it's the next element we're gonna introduce you.
1795920	1800920	So, speaking about that,
1801280	1804040	we're in the middle of the AI wars,
1804040	1806720	and a little rumor told me
1806720	1808560	that you got kicked off LinkedIn today.
1808560	1812200	Yeah, they identified our website as Malware first last week,
1812200	1813560	and then made all our job descriptions.
1813560	1814400	Today we're going to be kids.
1814400	1815440	Who owns LinkedIn, by the way?
1815440	1816480	I couldn't say.
1817320	1819120	Oh, Microsoft, huh?
1820400	1821600	So, it's gonna be very interesting.
1821600	1823400	The stakes are really high.
1823400	1824440	So, there's a lot of people
1824440	1826920	that don't want this technology to go out to the world.
1826920	1829000	Again, I think putting it on these tablets
1829000	1831680	for all these kids, building a national mold to everyone,
1831680	1834040	again, our mission is to build the foundation
1834040	1836080	to activate humanized potential,
1836080	1837640	and our motto is not, don't be evil,
1837640	1839160	let's make people happier.
1839160	1841720	And the happiest you can be is when you have agency.
1841720	1843200	Let everyone have their own agency
1843200	1845600	and create insane things.
1845600	1848160	On that note, let's give it up for Emon Scott.
1848160	1849000	Good.
1849000	1849840	Good.
