0	3760	These organizations are telling you that they're building something that could kill
3760	9360	you and something that could remove all our freedom and liberty. And they're
9360	12560	saying it's a good thing you should back them because it's cool. They don't care
12560	16400	about the revenue. If they have the political power people are scared of
16400	21080	them. Power should not be invested in any one individual. If I can accelerate this
21080	24720	over the next period I don't have to make an impact. I should not have any power
24880	28000	whereas again you see everyone else trying to get more and more power.
30320	34720	The only way that you can beat it to create the standard that represents humanity
35360	38880	is decentralized intelligence. It's collective intelligence.
39520	45200	The data sets and norms from that will be ones that help children, that help people suffering,
45920	51760	that reflect our moral upstanding and the best of us and gathers the best of us to do it.
55680	61280	A week ago, E-Mod Mistak was on my stage at Abundance 360 talking about the future of
61280	68240	open source AI, democratized, decentralized AI. The day after A360 he stepped down as CEO of
68240	74080	Stability. Now five days later I've sat down with E-Mod to talk about why he's stepping down,
74080	79280	what he's doing next, the future of AI. He takes the gloves off, he talks about the dangers of
79280	86480	centralized AI and the potential for decentralized democratized AI to be the only avenue that truly
86480	93440	uplifts all of humanity. All right, if you liked this episode please subscribe. Let's jump in. If
93440	98320	you're a mood shot entrepreneur this is an episode you're not going to want to miss. All right,
98320	102320	now on to E-Mod. Good morning E-Mod. Good to see you my friend.
102400	109920	Actually it's always pizza. So you and I were on stage literally last week at the 2024 Abundance
109920	117520	Summit talking about the whole open source AI movement. You were beginning to talk about
117520	123600	decentralized AI. You were talking about where Stability was the speed of the development of
123600	131840	the different products and the day after the Abundance Summit was over the news hit that you
131840	140000	had stepped down as CEO of Stability and stepped off the board. So let's begin with the obvious
140000	148640	question. Why? What happened and I have huge respect for you and I know a lot of the issues in the
148640	154240	past but I'd like you to have a chance to share with entrepreneurs out there and folks interested in
154240	162800	AI exactly your side of what's happening. Yeah, thanks. I think that Elon Musk once characterized
162800	171600	being a CEO as staring into the abyss and chewing glass because you are looking at a very uncertain
171600	175360	future having to make decisions and the chewing glass is all the problems that come to you all
175360	183200	the time and it's required to steer the ship when things are incredibly uncertain and Stability
183200	188560	is a pretty unique company at a unique time. We hired our first developer and researcher two
188560	194160	years ago and then in those two years we built the best models of almost every type except for large
194160	201520	language, image, audio, 3D etc and had over 300 million downloads of the various models we created
201520	208880	and supported which was a bit crazy and then gent of AI is crazy. In terms of usually in a startup
208880	213600	you don't have to deal with global leaders and policy debates about the future of humanity
214240	221360	and AI and everything else. At the same time building code. At the same time as building code
221360	229600	yes and especially building code to a fraction of the resources of our competitors. We had
230400	236240	certain teams that offered triple their entire packages to move to other companies. It was
236240	245120	grateful that only a couple of researchers left for other companies and that was just startups.
245120	249760	No one left for another big company which I think is testament to their kind of loyalty in the mission
250720	255600	but you know what we've seen over the last year is or last half year in particular is the question
255600	264560	of governance in AI is something that's incredibly important and who manages, owns, controls this
264560	270480	technology and how it's distributed. So we saw you know everything from kind of open AI to congressional
270480	275200	testimonies to other things and as you know one of my things has always been how do we get this
275200	280800	technology in the hands of people all around the world and then who governs it and how can we then
280800	286080	take this technology to have an impact from education to healthcare to others. The stability
286080	291600	is a company that build great base models and we got to that point. The revenue is going up
291600	296640	which is always nice you know finding the business model and again I think it was always curious to
296640	301520	see that as a deep tech company two years in people are asking us you know why aren't you
301520	305600	profitable and I was like right it takes a bit of time and investment to get to profitability.
307040	312240	I think opening AI when they took they're not there yet but then they have eight years I think
312240	317360	all the comparisons are perhaps unfair. So reviewing everything and kind of looking at it I was like
317360	323200	do I really want to be a CEO? I think the answer is no. I think there is a lot imbued in that in
324000	330560	tech but it's a very interesting position. Just to dive into that a second because we've had this
330560	338480	conversation because there was a lot of pressure asking whether for you to step down as CEO
340400	346960	and I think founders typically want to see themselves or feel they need to be the CEO
347520	352880	and I've heard you say recently you know that you view yourself more as a founder and strategist
352880	358160	than the CEO is that a fair assessment? Yeah I think everyone's got their own skill sets right
358160	364000	so I'm particularly great at taking creatives, developers, researchers, others and achieving
364000	370400	their full potential in designing systems but I should not be dealing with you know HR and
370400	374480	operations and business development and other elements they're probably better people than me
374560	380400	to do that. So now for example our most popular thing Stable Diffusion and come to UI the system
380400	386240	around it is the most widely used image software models in the world. There are great media CEOs
386240	390080	that can take that and amplify that to make hundreds of millions of revenues so they should come in
390080	399040	and meet on that. So why now pal what is there anything that specifically tipped for you that has
399840	406400	I mean because you know it has you know you have done an extraordinary job this has been your baby
407600	415920	I mean how you have to feel a whole slew of emotional elements and I've had to step down
415920	422720	as CEO on two occasions over the 27 companies I've had to sell a company for pennies on the
422720	432000	dollar and it takes an emotional hardship on you. I've had calls for me to step down as CEO
432000	439040	since the well since 2022 you know but I always thought you know what's best for the company in
439040	444320	the mission and where I look at the world right now there's a few things a the company has momentum
444320	449760	it has spread it's turning into a business like last year I said let's not enter into large revenue
449760	454480	contracts because technology isn't mature yet and our processes aren't mature yet and you have to
454480	459120	deliver so we do a lot of experimental things we're setting up and again now it's ramping
459120	464480	on a business side on a technology side the technology is maturing diffusion transformers
464480	468240	such as stable diffusion 3 and saura are going to be the next big thing and again stability has
468240	474320	got a great place there but I think there's also the macro on this so if you look at the open AI
474400	481360	you know sam altman said the board can fire me anytime this is the governance of open AI
482080	488320	and then they fired him and then he is back on and he appoints himself back on the board
488960	492880	there's clearly no governance opening I mean I respect the people on the board greatly
492880	497520	you know I think there's some great individuals but who should manage the technology that drives
497520	503200	humanity and teaches every child and manages our governance who's really needy on that that can build
503200	508560	these models and do those things as you know I've always wanted to build these science models and
508560	514560	the other health teams done that I want me doing the education work and then my concept of a national
514560	519600	model for every country owned by the people of the country all tied together I think it needs to be
519600	526240	by a web three not crypto or necessary token framework that's something that's a brand new
526240	532080	kind of challenge and one that I think there's only a window of a year or two to do if you have
532160	535600	highly capable models let's put aside a geo for now which you can discuss later
536240	542400	really accelerating then no one will be able to keep up with that unless you build in a decentralized
542400	548320	manner and distributed manner for data talent distribution standards and more so there's only
548320	553120	a small window of time here to do that and realistically again successful companies and
553120	559120	these things are all great but genitifia is a bit bigger than the classical knobs just like
559120	563120	the whole lifecycle of the company was a lot faster than the classical norms so that's why I
563120	569360	felt you know now is the right time to make that change and hopefully play my part in making sure
569360	574960	this technology is distributed as widely as possible and governed properly as pretty much I
574960	580000	think I'm the only real independent agent that has built state-of-the-art models in the world right
580000	590960	now yeah we've seen a lot of turbulence with open AI we just saw Mustafa from inflection become part
590960	600720	of Microsoft and I am curious I mean you you had a now famous conversation with Satya a couple of
600720	608000	days after stepping down was that investigatory on your part or was that just a touch base for
608000	613440	an old friend oh that's just chill trolling actually you know like to let us in steam that
613440	622080	picture was I think from when year or two year or so ago okay but you know I think Satya is an
622080	628640	amazing CEO and you know he responds again like the top CEO's incredibly quickly when you message
630400	634800	he's got a great vision but there is again this concern about consolidation in tech
634800	640160	we didn't take money from any trillion dollar companies that stability you know we remained
640160	647040	and retained full independence you know and you know to the detriment of some of the elements
647040	653120	that we could have taken very big checks and other things and even though you have good attention
653120	658400	to that room that companies are slight slow dumb ai's that over optimize for various things
658960	662640	and that's more solely in the best interest of humanity when you have infrastructure
663600	669600	it's like this is the airports the railways the roads of the future AI is an infrastructure
669600	674480	gentle that is an infrastructure which should be and should it be consolidated under the control
674480	680080	of a few private companies with unclear objective functions again the people in the companies may
680080	685280	be great I don't think so and this is a key concern and part of that was that commentary again he's
685280	691200	doing an amazing job he's consolidating a lot of power for the good of the company and also he has
691360	697120	I think genuinely good heart mission to bring technology to the world but it is a bit concerning
697120	701600	right especially with the new types of structure you're speaking of Sam in this case
702240	706640	Satya here oh sat here like a really like again I think the commentary was always interesting
706640	712000	it's like you know sat here playing 40 chess you know assembling the AI Avengers I mean he is
712000	716960	he's building an amazing massive talent covering the bases and Microsoft is doing incredibly well
716960	721280	here right if you asked who's doing best to join tomorrow I think would say Microsoft
722320	726320	but there is has to be concerns about consolidation of talent and power and reach
726320	730800	before I get to your vision going forward because it's so important and what you're doing next
732400	742560	I just again as a founder as a CEO of a moonshot company we have a lot of those listening here
743280	749680	can ask how are you feeling right now because the decision to step down has to have huge emotional
750240	758160	are you feeling relief are you feeling anxiety what's what's the feeling after making a momentous
758160	769440	decision I was a big feeling of relief you know because there's the there's a Japanese concept
770400	776560	I know a guy and I love it yes yeah do what you like and do where you believe you're adding value
776560	783600	and other people do too you know like realistically again I think I was an excellent research leader
783600	788080	strategist other things but I didn't communicate properly or hire the right other leaders in
788080	792480	certain other areas of the company and they're better people to do that and so I wasn't doing
792480	798640	what I was best at a lot or I could have the most measurable value and it was tying down you know
798640	802640	there's a lot of legacy you know technical organization or other debt especially when
802640	807360	you grow so so so fast and you know we were lucky that we had higher attention in the
807360	812160	important areas and we could execute in spite of all of that in spite of going to be company
812160	816640	around I think you know moonshot founders you have to do because you don't have the resources at
816640	821680	the start and you have to guide the ship you know as it goes out from port but there does come that
821680	827600	transition point there and there is a competing thing where you typically take on VC money which
827600	833120	holds an objective function versus your overall mission so again if you look at the genitive
833120	840480	AI world right now how many credible intelligent independent voices are there there they've had
840480	845600	the ability to build models and design things and make an impact you know there's not many so
846160	851360	I was like that's where I can add my most leverage and also the design space is again
851360	857760	is unprecedentedly huge because the entire market has just been created like where does
857760	862800	gentify not fit and where does it not touch and what needs to be built there we need to actually
862800	870320	have the agency to go and build that and so I felt tired relieved I felt that now there's a
870320	875520	million options I want it rather than taking a long break get on with things I've just done the
875520	879760	first thing in kind of web three and I've got a whole bunch of other things we were going to discuss
879760	886880	kind of coming and catalyze stuff that can make an exponential benefit because you know like massively
886880	891600	transformed to purpose here is I want every kid to achieve their potential and give them the tools
891600	898400	to do that and I love you for that because you've been true to that that vision and I know on the
898400	904320	heels of your announcement you've been reached out to by national leaders by corporate you know by
904400	910480	CEOs and major investment groups and you have a lot of opportunity ahead of you so
911760	918560	let's talk about where you want to go next you mentioned publicly and you discussed on our
918560	926800	abundance stage the idea of democratized and decentralized AI let's define that first what
926800	933360	is that why is it important and what do you want to do there yeah I think that when I said I'm going
934320	938880	move to do my part in decentralizing AI people like isn't that just open source you give the
938880	945040	technology right and then anyone can use it but it isn't a decentralizing AI has a few important
945040	951040	components one is availability and accessibility everyone should be able to access this technology
951040	955040	the fruits of labor and there's some very interesting political and other elements around that
955920	961440	number two is the governance of this technology you have centralized governance because the models
961440	965760	are the data there's a recent Databricks thing a model where they show that you have massive
965760	970560	improvements from data we all know that you know who governs the data that teaches your child or
970560	976320	manages your health or runs your government that's an important question I think too few are asking
976320	982480	and we need this transparency and other things like that so accessibility you know you've got the
983600	989920	governance aspect of that and then finally you have how does it all come together is a single
989920	996400	package or is it a modularized infrastructure that people can build on and is available kind
996400	1001600	of everywhere you know does it require monoliths and central servers where if it goes down you have
1001600	1007680	an outage on GPT-4 you're a bit messed up or someone can attack and corrupt it I think that
1007680	1011600	those are kind of the key elements that I was looking at when I was talking about decentralizing AI
1012240	1019760	and you know I've got with an infrastructure to do that I hope as well so if you don't mind let's
1019760	1025920	double click on it even further so you mentioned we don't have long to get there
1026960	1032800	if that's a true statement why don't we have long to get there and then what does getting
1032800	1040160	there look like if you had all the capital available and if the right national leaders were
1040160	1047440	hearing about this because a lot of this is supporting supporting the populace of a nation
1048080	1057840	um to have AI that serves them versus top down what's it look like two five ten years from now
1058560	1064720	yeah I think you'll have both proprietary and open source AI and they'll work in combination the
1064720	1069040	practical example I give is that this AI is like graduates right very talented slightly
1069040	1074960	enthusiastic graduates and you want those and consultants um but I really have you know on
1074960	1079520	stage with Matt Friedman last week at 8 360 when we're there he said it's like we discovered this
1079520	1084960	new concept what do you call it AI Atlantis yes yes with a hundred billion graduates that'll work
1084960	1090000	for free yes I love that analogy it was it was a brilliant analogy yeah we used to figure out how to
1090000	1096320	say Atlantis you know um but but there's a few things here first of all is the defaults you know
1096320	1102560	once a government embraces centralized technology it's very difficult to decentralize it and every
1102560	1112000	country needs an AI strategy a year ago one year ago was GPT-4 yeah crazy how crazy is that you know
1112000	1119840	the AI safety summit uh in the UK the king of England came on stage it all came via video call
1119840	1126000	and he said that this is the biggest thing since fire you know and that was like what six seven
1126000	1133680	months later where are we going to be in a year yeah I think he took that from uh uh from uh uh
1133680	1140960	the founder of the CEO of Google um AI is as powerful as fire and electricity yeah yeah yeah
1140960	1145280	I've heard the same from like Jeff Bezos and a bunch of others you know and not kindle fire
1145280	1151280	proper fire you know um but then if you think about it norms are going to be set in this next
1151280	1157600	period like you know I'm in California LA at the moment if you don't set norms on rights for actors
1157600	1162160	and the movie industry then you could have a massive disruption just occurring this full length
1162160	1168160	Hollywood features come in a year or two generated you know if you don't have norms around open models
1168160	1172400	and ownership and governance by the people it'll be top-down governance because governments can't
1173600	1179040	allow that to be out of control if they don't have a reasonable alternative um and I think the
1179040	1182480	window is only a year or two because every government must have a strategy by the end of the year
1183200	1187840	and so I think if you provide them a good solution that has this element of democratic
1187840	1193680	governance and others that will be immensely beneficial I think also it's urgent because
1193680	1198560	we have the ability to make a huge difference you know as we kind of may probably discuss later
1198560	1203360	having all the knowledge of cancer longevity autism at your fingertips you know the technology
1203360	1207920	for that right now you have the technology that no one ever is ever alone again on those things
1208000	1214000	or to give every child a superior education literally in a couple of years like there is an
1214000	1219680	urgency both from there's a small window but also from we must do this now because it can scale and
1219680	1224480	make that impact we have dreamed of for so long the enabling technology is finally in it's finally
1224480	1228160	good enough fast enough and cheap enough everybody want to take a short break from our episode to
1228160	1234000	talk about a company that's very important to me and could actually save your life or the life of
1234000	1239040	someone that you love company is called fountain life and it's a company I started years ago with
1239040	1245040	Tony Robbins and a group of very talented physicians you know most of us don't actually know what's
1245040	1251760	going on inside our body we're all optimists until that day when you have a pain in your side you go
1251760	1255680	to the physician in the emergency room and they say listen I'm sorry to tell you this but you have
1256320	1262880	this stage three or four going on and you know it didn't start that morning it probably was a problem
1262880	1269680	that's been going on for some time but because we never look we don't find out so what we built
1269680	1275280	at fountain life was the world's most advanced diagnostic centers we have four across the U.S.
1275280	1282400	today and we're building 20 around the world these centers give you a full body MRI a brain a brain
1282400	1289920	vasculature an AI enabled coronary CT looking for soft plaque dexa scan a grail blood cancer test
1289920	1297520	a full executive blood workup it's the most advanced workup you'll ever receive 150 gigabytes of data
1297520	1304800	that then go to our AIs and our physicians to find any disease at the very beginning when it's
1304800	1309760	solvable you're gonna find out eventually might as well find out when you can take action fountain
1309760	1314240	life also has an entire side of therapeutics we look around the world for the most advanced
1314240	1321280	therapeutics that can add 10 20 healthy years to your life and we provide them to you at our centers

1336160	1342160	out to us for fountain life memberships if you go to fountainlife.com backslash peter we'll put you
1342160	1348720	to the top of the list really it's something that is for me one of the most important things i offer
1348720	1356400	my entire family the CEOs of my companies my friends it's a chance to really add decades onto
1356400	1362240	our healthy lifespans go to fountainlife.com backslash peter it's one of the most important
1362240	1367520	things i can offer to you as one of my listeners all right let's go back to our episode so the
1367600	1373360	let's talk about the objective function of democratized and decentralized AI is it that the
1373360	1380880	compute is resonant in countries around the world is it that the models are owned by the
1380880	1388640	citizens of the world is it that data is owned and how do you get there from here i think that
1389200	1394320	you can think of the supercomputers like universities you don't need many universities
1394320	1398320	honestly if someone's building good quality models that's one of the things that says stability
1398320	1402640	and we did the hard task we could just stuck with image we said no we're gonna have the best 3d
1402640	1409280	image audio biomedical all these models and no one else managed that apart from open ai to agree
1409280	1414480	in fact i think we have more modalities than open ai again kind of what i kind of describe this
1414480	1422000	is accessibility and governance and a few of these other factors so i think what it means is that
1422000	1426800	this technology is available to everyone but you see now that you don't assume you need giant
1426800	1432160	supercomputers to even run it you know we showed you a language model running on a laptop stable
1432160	1438320	lm2 will run on a gigabyte on a mac macare faster than you can read you know we're writing some poems
1438320	1444960	various things you know um we see stable diffusion now at 300 images a second or consumer graphics
1444960	1451360	card our video model was like five gigabytes of v-round this really changes the equation because
1451360	1456560	in web 2 all the intelligence was centralized on these giant servers and big data now you have
1456560	1461840	big supercomputers i think you'll need less with better data training these graduates that can go
1461840	1466400	out and customize to each country but they must reflect the culture of that country like the
1466400	1471680	japanese stable diffusion model we had if you typed in salary man it gave you a very sad person
1471680	1476960	versus the base model giving you a very happy person right so you must have graduates that
1476960	1482880	reflect the local culture and then reflect the local knowledge and then global models again
1484000	1490720	that reflect our global knowledge and can be answered by anyone but who decides what goes
1490720	1496640	in that these are some very important questions and who vouchers for the quality as well what's
1496640	1503040	your advice to a national leader because you know we're now starting to see ministers of AI
1503040	1509600	in different nation states and what what's your advice to them right now in this area
1510320	1516240	i think my advice to them would be to start collecting the data sets that they would teach
1516800	1521360	a graduate that was very smart through school and kind of other things this is national broadcast
1521360	1526800	data this is the curriculum this is their accounting legal and others and note that those
1526800	1533920	data sets are infrastructure they will enable the local populist and others to create these models
1533920	1538640	because models are just data wrapped in algorithms with a bit of compute that's the recipe compute
1538640	1545040	algorithms and data and it's not going to be as hard as you think to train these models but you
1545040	1550000	have to build them to get standard so by the end of next year probably year after i would estimate
1550000	1557280	that a longer 7tb model or a stable diffusion model so these are two leading models in image
1557280	1563040	and language will cost about under ten thousand dollars probably even one thousand dollars to
1563040	1567600	train and then it comes all about the data and then it becomes about the standards
1569360	1576400	you know it's it's it it's interesting um there is so much knowledge in the world that will
1576800	1583040	vaporize sublimate over the decade ahead as people die you know cultural data locked up in
1583040	1588640	people's minds and stories and so forth that's never been recorded it's an interesting time to
1588640	1596480	actually capture that data and permanently store it into the national models yeah and again i think
1596480	1602240	people over focus on the models versus the data sets i mean is data set yeah yeah yeah with the
1603200	1608880	exponential compute you can recalibrate and improve the data as well so right now a lot of the
1608880	1614800	improvements in models are actually synthetically improving data and data quality as you said there's
1614800	1619760	so much that can be lost but now we can actually capture this and the concepts and the other
1619760	1625280	guidance and have crosschecks like you can deconstruct laws you know you can translate
1625280	1631600	between contexts you can make expert information available to everyone because again you have
1631600	1637520	this new continent of ai around us and all these graduates seem to be specialists that are on your
1637520	1644960	phone and that's incredibly democratizing you know um because otherwise the knowledge is
1644960	1651200	throughout history knowledge has always been gate kept always i want to get to uh health
1651200	1658320	and education next but before we go there i know you were meeting with a mutual friend
1658320	1666000	jewels or back the other day um and instability announced a deal with otoi endeavor and render
1666000	1672160	network um are you still an advisor to that venture you know this is part of the whole thing
1672160	1679200	it's the first of many web three kind of elements there i think web three is 95 percent let's say
1679200	1686800	90 percent i'll be generous um speculative and rubbish but there is that five ten percent of
1686800	1692320	genuine people that would be thinking about questions of governance coordination and others
1692320	1697520	and have built things that are proper so otoi is the bridge to the creative industry you know
1697520	1702880	that's why we're with arie manuel and eric schmidt and others are on the board um and the render
1702880	1709520	network is a million gpus largely from creative professionals that are available and so the first
1709520	1715840	thing i announced there i was going to be initial 10 million gaps 250 million of distributed compute
1715840	1722880	to create the best 3d data sets like stability we funded and worked with allen institution others on
1722880	1728320	objeverse excel which is 10 million high quality 3d assets we're going to a billion distributed
1728320	1733280	you don't need giant supercomputers but then that is a community good that is owned by the people of
1733280	1739680	the network and accessible to non-academic and others as well why because you need high quality
1739680	1744240	assets to create better 3d models we have a new 3d model tried by us all that can generate a 3d
1744240	1749840	image from a 2d image and not go five seconds and that 3d model feeds into better 3d assets
1750480	1754560	and then what does that mean it means we're heading towards the holodeck without the data
1754560	1759760	you're not going to get there and that joules joules wants the holodeck for sure yeah so you
1759760	1764160	know jules and i are the same phase of that you know and you're not going to get there without
1764160	1770160	again a commons of data that can train the graduates that then become specialized with star trek or
1770800	1775600	you know star wars or any of these other ips and then also setting standards around
1776800	1783040	monetization ip rights all sorts of other things and so a network like render is really good for
1783040	1787120	that but you know i've been talking to a lot of people in web three about the different elements
1787120	1792160	of the stack because what i basically see is that we have the opportunity to build
1792960	1799440	almost a human operating system models and data sets for every nation every sector coordinated
1799440	1804720	through proper web three principles again not speculative tokens or anything like that
1805600	1810960	you know making it so that every child in the world or adult can create anything they can imagine
1811840	1816400	they can be protected against the harms and they have access to the right information at the right
1816400	1823760	time to thrive and again that's infrastructure for everyone it's a common good access to gpu's has
1823760	1831920	been sort of the limited fuel um do you think decentralized gpu structures like render is part
1831920	1838560	of that future is an important part of that future i think right now it's far more efficient to train
1838560	1843520	models on these again big supercomputers the university but the rate of exponential growth
1843520	1849920	there again is insane last year to train lama two cost ten million dollars in a year or cost
1849920	1855760	ten thousand dollars a thousand times improvement from algorithms data supercomputes speeds
1857040	1862160	and that's crazy if you think about it right um so i think this will be the limiting factor i think
1862160	1867200	the gpu overhang four language models probably lasts until the end of the year but then there's
1867200	1873600	plentiful supply because what you have is nvidia makes amazing gpu's at an 83 or 87 percent margin
1873840	1880560	right but the actual calculations aren't complicated like we took intel gpu's and we ran the stable
1880560	1884240	diffusion three diffusion transformer training so this is the same technology that's used in
1884240	1888720	saura and stable diffusion three is multimodal so it can train saura models with enough compute
1889440	1893200	and i think us and them are the only people kind of doing this so i think maybe pixart as well
1894560	1902000	and then it ran faster than the intel gpu's than the nvidia gpu's but we know that it can run even
1902000	1906640	faster because it's not optimized for either and it's still running fast so what you'll see
1906640	1912240	is a commoditization of the hardware once the architect just gets stabilized because gpu is
1912240	1918000	just a research artifact still diffusion was just a research artifact you're not going to
1918000	1924160	engineer in phase yet and you've got to the point whereby this runs on macbooks it runs on other
1924160	1930080	things so i think it's a short term phenomenon of the next year because people were taking a point
1930080	1935440	in time and extrapolating without taking into account efficiencies optimizations
1936240	1941040	and the fact that models that work on the edge and it can go to your private data will be more
1941040	1946560	impactful than generalized intelligence everyone's over indexing on generalized intelligence and
1946560	1955760	building ai god versus amplified human intelligence shall we say before we leave stability it's now
1955760	1964320	in the hands of the chair and your past cto what's what do you imagine the future of stability
1964320	1968960	is going to be going forward i know that you're not involved anymore it's under different leadership
1968960	1973280	and there's a what's your advice to them or where do you think they're going to go
1974400	1978320	you know i can do the very basic advice i didn't want any conflicts or anything because
1978320	1983680	i'll be setting up lots of new companies and you know being a founder and a shareholder
1983760	1988320	and against stability i'm a founder shareholder in fact you're still the majority shareholder
1988320	1993840	i think i said right now yeah just about just about yeah that will change i'm sure new money
1993840	1999440	will come in like we saw co here yesterday and i think it's very little 20 million of revenue
1999440	2004160	run rate they're raising at five billion might as well it's increasing yes yeah with the right
2004160	2009760	leadership i think that um it can again have an amazing part to play in media and that's what i've
2009760	2015040	suggested to it um and again there's a great team that continues to ship great models so last week
2015040	2020000	there was an amazing code model next week amazing language audio and other models are coming out so
2020000	2026240	you know you continue shipping and great products around that too um so that was kind of my advice
2026240	2031920	to them let's focus on media and take that forward but you know i'm not the expert on the business
2031920	2038560	side of things i did the best i could my expertise on setting this up and taking it 0 to 10 and uh
2038560	2048240	yeah is zero zero one is is definitely um a role that that you've played here and allow it allow
2048240	2055280	someone else to take it the rest of the way uh but the area that i know actually there's something
2055280	2059200	i wanted to kind of discuss here that thing's quite important please or again the founder's
2059200	2065360	listing and the moonshot companies um there is an imbalance of power when you have
2065840	2073040	very visionary highly competent leaders there like what i found its stability is there everyone
2073040	2077040	would be waiting for me no matter how competent because i was the one that could see around the
2077040	2082480	corners and i was a bit good at everything even if i hired people that built billion dollar startups
2082480	2088080	or were leaders and research at google or kind of whatever um because you have an outside thing
2088080	2092640	this is what kind of better says you have to speak last in some cases and some people in eating
2093360	2098240	because otherwise everyone just does everything you say and they also wait on you now what i
2098240	2102400	find and what i told the team is that you're flat as a power dynamic you're all on the same page
2102400	2107040	you're all kind of relatively equal owners and it'll be interesting to see how it evolves from that
2107680	2111920	given that there's actually a business and again i think this is something that you probably had a
2111920	2118400	challenge within other founders here whereby they put more on your plate because you are so visionary
2118400	2123520	and because you're like up there in the future and they're always waiting on you so you was like
2123520	2127360	well my schedule is completely packed my schedule now is actually quite free which is also quite
2127360	2131760	nice i've had a chance to speak with you every day for the last few days so that's been a pleasure
2131760	2139360	to have extra time on your schedule you know so so we do have a world of uh visionary founder led
2140000	2145360	CEO companies right so you've got musk and you've got bezos historically and you had steve jobs and
2145360	2152480	you have and and that's both powerful and dangerous the the power is the ability for that
2152480	2158560	because we don't ever have a company that is pre-existing a new CEO comes in and has the same
2161920	2166560	both hootspa and and also the power of their of their vision
2167280	2167760	um
2169600	2176800	the danger there your concern you're you're saying is not not allowing your team to step
2176800	2182880	up with their own vision or being over overly indexed on your on your vision yeah i think that
2182880	2187840	that can be the issue and that's why i wanted stability to again reach the point of spread
2187840	2193440	and revenue rate increase and other things before i do anything um and i felt again this
2193440	2198560	external pressure in that if nobody or there's very few people in the world actually thinking
2198560	2202720	properly about governance and spread and others and a very small window giving the pace of this
2202720	2207840	to make a difference in the dent i believed i had a reasonable approach to that but i couldn't
2207840	2213280	while remaining CEO of this company and again it's a pretty unique scenario because you've never
2213280	2219600	seen a sector move this fast that has such wide-reaching human implications and regressively
2219680	2227360	there's too few people i think with the right alignment and approach in this area i've been
2227360	2232800	very disappointed like usually what happens is you have power maximization equations and this
2232800	2239200	is what we're seeing from the industry consolidation how many people want to genuinely bring this
2239200	2246080	technology to kids in nigeria or to the global south or to help those leaders build their own
2246080	2250560	models you know and believe also in a positive some game that was actually my biggest surprise
2250560	2257280	from the discussions to lincoln valley almost entirely they all believe in uh flat or negative
2257280	2262560	some you know zero some or negative some things where there has to be a winner everyone's a winner
2262560	2269840	in this and again i was just very disappointed seeing that i've been asking for you for a while to
2269840	2274720	write and distribute your vision white paper because i've heard you describe it in detail
2274720	2279040	and it's brilliant and i still hope that the world will see it soon enough everybody you
2279040	2283120	want to take a break from our episode to tell you about an amazing company on a mission to
2283120	2289600	prevent and reverse chronic disease by decoding your biology the company is called viome and
2289600	2295840	they offer cutting-edge tests and personalized products that help you optimize your gut microbiome
2295840	2301360	your oral microbiome and your cellular health as you probably know your microbiome is a collection
2301360	2307680	of trillions of microbes that live in your gut and mouth and these microbiomes influence everything
2307680	2314560	your digestion immunity mood weight and many other aspects of your health but not all microbes are
2314560	2320800	good for you some can cause inflammation toxins and actually lead to chronic diseases like diabetes
2320800	2328640	heart disease obesity and even cancer viome uses advanced mRNA technology and ai to analyze your
2328640	2334400	microbes and your cells and give you personalized nutrition recommendations and products designed
2334400	2340080	specifically for your genetics specifically for your biology you can choose from different tests
2340080	2345760	depending on your goals and needs ranging from improving your gut health your oral health cellular
2345760	2351360	function or all of them i've been using viome for the past three years i can tell you that it has
2351360	2357520	made a huge difference in my health and because the data they collect and the ai engine they've built
2357520	2363840	it gets better every single day i love getting health scores and seeing how my diet and lifestyle
2363840	2369760	affects my microbiome and my cells and i love getting precision supplements and probiotics tailored
2369760	2374800	for my specific needs if you want to join me on this journey of discovery and improve your health
2374800	2381840	from the inside out viome has a special offer for you for a limited time you can get up to 40% off
2382480	2389440	any viome test using the code moonshots just go to viome.com backslash moonshots and order your
2389440	2395360	test today trust me you won't regret it all right let's go back to our episode before we jump into
2395360	2399680	into health and education let's talk about governance a second because we've seen governance
2402160	2406720	complicate this what is the right governance structure for this super powerful technology
2407280	2410960	we have representation of democracy that i think can be improved by this like i don't think
2410960	2415760	democracy survives this technology it's current for it will either improve or it'll end
2416640	2422720	i don't see anything else like yesterday though what does end what does end mean here a benign
2422720	2429840	dictatorship a driven by an ai overlord yeah like yesterday there was a announcement of an app called
2429840	2436000	Hume which had emotionally intelligent speech and they can understand your emotions and talk with
2436640	2440800	you know i have to discuss this yes you know where that's going right it's very powerful
2441600	2446880	it's incredibly powerful and governments have a tendency i mean if there's no government but
2446880	2452880	say it say it here it's important for you to state what what it means because we've discussed it but
2452880	2459280	help people here be ready for this and democracy is all about representation and you see the
2459280	2463680	questions of deep fakes and things speech is one of the most impactful elements there but now you
2463680	2471920	can't believe anything you see here everything so one path that we have is a 1984 on steroids
2472720	2477920	panoptica you know where life is gamified and you listen to whatever the government says and
2477920	2481760	they're incredibly convincing and you're happy and you've always been happy and you've always been
2481760	2487600	at war with eurasia you know propaganda on steroids the other path that you have is things like
2487600	2493280	citizen assemblies consults of democracy the ability to take right now you can take any of
2493280	2500320	the bills in congress and completely deconstruct them and find what the motivations are you know
2500320	2506080	you can check laws against the constitution in a second seconds this is an incredibly powerful
2506080	2511040	empowering technology from a democratic perspective so i see two routes unfortunately because i think
2511040	2517040	that once the right thing goes it goes really fast centralized government control increasing
2517040	2522080	because the government want to protect themselves as an organization and you know every party says
2522080	2526720	the other party's crap we've seen the increasing polarization in america already
2526720	2530400	and you know fundamentally come on you can do better than those two leaders that are currently
2530400	2536400	competing i'm saying this is clear our system is sclerotic across this like democracy is the worst
2536400	2541760	of all systems except for everyone else you can have a better democracy where it's actually
2541760	2548880	representative and empowers the people or we will have the end of democracy where it is in 1984
2548880	2553440	panopticon in my opinion because the momentum will go then of course you'll start using this
2553440	2558960	technology you're already seeing it being used but not at scale and not intelligently yet which is
2558960	2567040	scary i think we finally have the technology for a direct democracy versus a representative
2567040	2575120	democracy right where i can have my my desires directly represented on any specific law or
2576080	2585920	but i think the point you've made before is that speech if you look back to everybody from
2585920	2595360	hitler to some of the most persuasive politicians is is a powerful tool and ai can become the most
2595360	2600960	persuasive speaker out there it can take anyone's speech to make it far more persuasive like i think
2601040	2606080	my voice is a bit whiny i can remove the wine you know i can go in a very polished british accent
2606080	2610560	and other things like that right you know must fight them on the hills and the harriers and
2610560	2615680	whatever public speaking needs to be different someone took hitler's speeches and put them
2615680	2621440	through an ai and took them into english because when we're not in the german context and we listen
2621440	2625920	to them it sounds like he's shouting like well that's crazy thing you hear him in english it is
2625920	2632000	very different in his own voice just like someone took javier mele's one in the united nations
2632000	2637440	and put him into english again he sounds a bit sharp how shouty but then he sounds very reasonable
2637440	2643120	when it's in english and you can take the phenomes of obama's best speech and a bit of trumpinism
2643120	2648080	and a bit of churchill and you'll have full modulation wave control over all of this people
2648080	2654000	are already using this technology that everyone should have a passcode with their loved ones because
2654000	2659200	people are getting calls from their mother saying help i'm in an emergency and you just
2659200	2664560	send money right now and you cannot tell it and it pulls at the emotional strengths and if you
2664560	2669600	look at something like us radio and you know one side of the political divide is taken over imagine
2669600	2675840	if you're hearing optimized speech every single day that will have a huge impact and then they
2675840	2681040	control the visuals and they control the other things we're not set up for defenses yeah if it's
2681360	2687200	optimized speech for you specifically for you right for the kids you have the age group they
2687200	2692720	have where you live your historical background and so forth and end of one persuasive speech
2693360	2701040	coming at you the brain is not set up for defenses we're not and you know we take this as an example
2701040	2706320	of the youtube algorithm like youtube as an organization is not an evil organization but
2706320	2710960	it's an organization optimized for engagement which optimized for more extreme content so this
2710960	2717200	is a dark place in youtube which is an optimized for ices the ices video spread viral i don't know
2717200	2723040	sometimes viral is good sometimes viral is bad that one was bad because it was extreme and they
2723040	2729680	didn't understand why and if you look at it our two of our largest germ to bear companies are google
2730240	2736720	and meta and their business is advertising their business manipulation and they are both a moral
2736720	2743280	companies because why would you expect a company to have morality our governments are also a moral
2743920	2748640	and again you can view these things as slow dumb ai so you can see the way they will optimize
2748640	2753520	unless we do something about it and they will have full control like again you put on your vision
2753600	2760960	pro headset with your spatial audio that is full sensory control not full but you know what i mean
2762000	2769680	full immersion full immersion full immersion and so we have to be aware of this and there's
2769680	2773840	obviously other tools that can be used like in the wake of the ab spring you know governments
2773840	2777840	targeted everyone else in social media we can do that on a high-end hyper-personalized basis
2778720	2787200	like we need to set some defaults and standards here to protect democracy but again why democracy
2788240	2791840	we're not really trying to protect democracy you know again people have different definition
2791840	2797840	that what we're trying to protect is individual liberty freedom and agency education should be
2797840	2803200	about enhancing the education of every child it's not you know healthcare is sick care our government
2803200	2807360	should uplift us but how many people believe our governments do that rather than put us down
2807920	2813680	because they couldn't encapsulate and cater to the brilliance of each individual
2815680	2819120	because they didn't have the tools until now so that's why i said which way one man
2819760	2826320	yes which way an agency or massive control these are the two ways do we control the technology
2826320	2832800	or do these organizations control the technology that controls us you know when we were on the stage
2832880	2838320	at at the abundant summit we talked about a future of digital superintelligence right
2838320	2846480	and a future in which we've got AI a billion times more capable than a human which looking at it
2846480	2856800	just from a ratio of neurons is the ratio of a hamster to a human um yep uh do you believe
2856800	2864480	that someday we could have a a benign superintelligence that is supporting humanity
2865680	2869280	yes and i believe that it should be a collective intelligence
2870560	2877040	that is made up of amplified human intelligence is amplifying all of us pilots that contain our
2877040	2882160	collective knowledge and culture and the best of us and datasets that are built from helping and
2882160	2889360	augmenting us versus a collected intelligence and agi that is top down and designed to effectively
2889360	2894400	control us again if you look at open ai statements on the rote agi they say this technology will end
2894400	2901520	democracy and capitalism and maybe kill us all i don't like that i remember i remember seeing that
2901520	2907520	you you you texted me you said read this does this sound the same as it does to me yeah so what
2907520	2911680	i'd prefer instead is for this to be distributed like if you have datasets formations that are
2911680	2916800	built on enhancing the capability of the nation that reflect the local cultures and you push for
2916800	2921680	data transparency on models which i believe we must have you know especially language models
2921680	2926480	then you're more likely to have a positive thing and again the human collective can achieve anything
2926480	2931360	from splitting the atom to go into space if we put our minds to it but we have lacked in
2931360	2937680	coordination mechanisms they've not been good enough so if you create the human colossus and
2937680	2943520	every single person has an ai that's just looking at them to enhance their potential and coordination
2943520	2950000	ai's that is a far more positive view of the future and that is the agi that is a general
2950000	2954720	intelligence that's the hive mind general intelligence not a bog style hive mind but one
2954720	2959840	that's really thinking again every child should achieve their potential versus this embodied
2959840	2963680	concept of an agi that's a very western concept and you see that as well like you know we look at
2963680	2969200	the japanese concept of a robot the robot is your equal and your helper you look at the western
2969200	2974400	concept of the robot it's terminator and spinet and all of that and again i think this is again
2974400	2978800	where cultural norms become very interesting and what do we want to build we want to build ai god
2979520	2983520	or do we want to build that ai helper that helps us and we help it you know
2984000	2993680	um those listening now i mean you can see umad's brilliance and why i'm so enamored with the way
2993680	2999360	you think about this because it's there are very few individuals who are looking at this from
2999920	3003760	an objective function of what's best for humanity what's best for every nation state
3004880	3011680	out there let's talk about your going forward future are you going to build something in the
3012480	3021120	in the decentralized side of of ai the democratized size of ai is there a company there or a fund in
3021120	3027040	your future for that yeah so uh you're not doing the white paper finally getting there with a bit
3027040	3033120	of help from ai uh i can't i can't i can't wait to uh to help uh broadcast that white paper
3033840	3039440	yeah but look i think the basic thing is this what i want to do is set up a ai champion in every
3039440	3044400	nation with the brightest people of each nation working with the organization of each nation
3044400	3048560	to help guide them through this next period because there will be massive job displacement
3048560	3053760	from the graduates going massive uplifts and productivity from the technology being implemented
3053760	3059920	and again that organization can help govern and create these data sets and these models that
3059920	3065120	are so important and every nation should have that but then i also believe that every sector
3065120	3069760	should have a genitive ai first infrastructure company that builds this and helps the healthcare
3069760	3075200	companies finance companies and others through that and to coordinate all of that you need to have
3075200	3080000	a web three type protocol what is the protocol for intelligence so what what is a web what is a
3080000	3085200	web three type protocol to find that for folks listening again people talk about web three it's
3085200	3090320	not about the tokens or the meme coins or anything like that what about three protocols is that
3090400	3093920	everyone should have like ai's first of all if i'm going to have bank accounts
3095440	3100480	they're going to need some way to pay each other or exchange value and again web three is a lot
3100480	3105600	of work in that there needs to be some sort of identity attribution and other format because
3105600	3111840	you'll have this mass influx of information and so again web three concepts are very useful there
3111840	3117120	there needs to be an identity concept because you'll have real and digital people web three concepts
3117120	3122960	are very useful there so data access station all these other things verifiability so when i look at
3122960	3128560	it if you've got sectorally my plan is to launch a company for every major sector and we can talk
3128560	3132240	about health and education and bring the smartest people in the world to solve that challenge of
3132240	3136880	the infrastructure for the future every nation but you need to have some sort of coordinating
3136880	3142800	protocol for all of that that becomes a standard and that's the substrate for this amplified human
3142800	3148480	collective intelligence and and is that where you want to play and focus your energy next
3149200	3154000	yeah it's setting up these organizations and bringing the brightest smartest people that
3154000	3158240	really want to make a difference there because there's massive network effects in doing this
3158240	3162080	but again i just need to be the founder and architect i don't want to run the day to day of
3162080	3168560	any of these things um and then because the the most scarce talent that there's three types of
3168560	3175040	capital as i view it there's financial capital human capital and political capital and in order
3175040	3179440	to effect change in the world you actually need all three but the financial capital actually comes
3179440	3185120	with the people capital and the political capital and the smartest people in the world in every sector
3185120	3190960	from health care to education to finance to agriculture almost all believe that gentry
3190960	3195760	is the biggest thing they've ever seen in the last year everyone's asking you all the smartest
3195760	3199920	people peter what's next right and you know many of the smartest people in the world so i want to
3199920	3205760	create organizations that they can come the chefs and the cooks the thinkers and the doers and think
3205760	3211040	what is the future of finance that's the future of education and then the national champions that
3211040	3216640	should be owned by the people of each country become the distribution for the amazing infrastructure
3216640	3221440	they built and there's a vice a nice kind of vice versa but then again you need the coordination
3221440	3226000	function so i'm trying to bring together people in each of these and you know there'll be public
3226000	3229760	calls and things like that to build that infrastructure the future because as mentioned
3230560	3234320	ai isn't infrastructure but it should be i mean maybe it's the rocket ship of the mind right
3235840	3240320	i love that i love that analogy my friend it is the most important infrastructure
3240320	3245040	that humanity will have going forward across everything it does and i look forward to helping
3245040	3250960	you build it exciting right like again i think one of the things i got i got lots of messages
3251040	3255920	that like i'm so sorry for your loss it was like my dog had died after i left to see you
3256560	3262800	i was like what is that you know they're like i was nice it's nice that people care right but i'm
3262800	3267920	generally excited about what's next like you know again it was like staring into the abyss
3267920	3274160	and chewing gloss every single day and that's not what i'm best at or i could have the most impact
3274160	3278480	but i wanted to be a point whereby if i can accelerate this over the next period i don't
3278480	3284800	have to make an impact i should not have any power on this whereas again you see everyone
3284800	3288560	else trying to get more and more power i want to make sure it's set up properly but i want to give
3288560	3294720	it all away because power is obligation it's dragging and again it should not be invested in
3294720	3301120	any one individual we shouldn't have to rely on anyone being nice or good or for this technology
3301120	3306080	i was talking to uh michael sailor during the abundant summit uh that evening and you know
3306080	3313520	talking about the fact that because satoshi uh when he set it up uh did not retain any power
3313520	3319120	and did not trade on the founding blocks and so forth that that's the reason it's been able to
3319120	3325440	succeed because there wasn't that centralized power and you know bitcoin had been he said bitcoin
3325440	3333680	betrayed many times before but because it didn't have that uh initial anonymity and and and the
3333680	3338880	dissolution of founding power that that's the reason it didn't succeed yeah i mean again i think
3338880	3343760	you need to have it accelerate and you see this with movements right the movement starts but then
3343760	3349680	it goes once you've got the dna and the story there right you know you see the profits you see the
3349680	3354960	leaders you see the others but then it's about setting the framework correctly and reframing the
3354960	3361120	concept this technology is not going to look stability is a company that started two years
3361120	3366560	ago above a chicken shop in london right you know my first 20 employees i went to the job
3366560	3371760	center and i said bring me people that have overcome adversity and i will train them young
3371760	3377120	graduates and six of them are still at stability you know um like because it was a program and
3377120	3382160	they're doing things from cyber security to run supercomputers we only had like 16 17 phd's
3382800	3387200	yet we built the state-of-the-art models in every modality we built mind-reading models
3387200	3392480	like mind's eye you know i remember that contributed to all these things yet you're
3392480	3397120	told it's impossible to compete we have shown it's not impossible to compete that's a reframing
3397760	3403120	the reframing is data versus models it's you don't need giant supercomputers for everyone
3403120	3409760	you just need to have a trusted entity to build it right yeah you know and so i hope to kind of
3409760	3414320	convey this and then figure out this organizational structure that can proliferate so i can take the
3414320	3420560	holiday so before we go further let's talk about one area of your next chapter in life that
3421120	3426320	we both have as a passion which is the use of generative ai in health it's an area that you've
3426320	3431840	given a huge amount of thought to and i think you're excited about can you share what your vision is
3431840	3439440	there yeah so i got into ai 13 years ago gosh i was a programmer before for 23 years building
3439440	3444640	large-scale systems as a hedge fund manager and other things well my son was diagnosed with autism
3444640	3448560	and then i built an nlp team to analyze all the clinical literature and then looked at
3449280	3454080	biomolecular pathway analysis of neurotransmitters gavra and glutamate in the brain to repurpose
3454080	3458800	drugs for him and he went to macy's school which is great n equals one and then i was one of i was
3458800	3464160	lead architect from the one the covet ai project so the united nations for stanford and others
3464160	3467040	and then because i didn't get the technology i was like well we've got to build it ourselves
3467440	3474560	but what is health you know again i think we have this discussion a lot health care is sick care
3475280	3478880	we don't have all the information that we should have at our fingertips health assumes
3478880	3484480	ergodicity a thousand tosses of the coin the same as the coin tossed a thousand times but we are
3484480	3490560	all individual and across the world there are amazing data sets that could be better because
3490560	3496560	when you write down a clinical trial or your own kind of experiences you lose so much information
3496640	3501440	at the same time you don't have all the information on cancer or autism multiple
3501440	3505680	sclerosis at your fingertips in the comprehensive authoritative and upstate way so when i look at
3505680	3514240	the health operating system we're going to build a gpt for open for cancer and it's going to mean
3514240	3519360	that nobody is alone again on that journey and uses that agency because they know comprehensive
3519360	3525280	authoritative upstate all the knowledge but ai models today already outperform human doctors
3525280	3530000	and empathy they're not going to be a learn on that anymore can i just double click on what you
3530000	3534800	just said because it's really important i've had so many people because of my role as chairman of
3534800	3539920	fountain life who reach out and say i just got diagnosed with this cancer or my brother or my
3539920	3548720	sister or my wife and and there is they're left with this decimating news and they're left googling
3549440	3556640	um but a model that's able to have the most cutting-edge information and then incorporate
3556640	3563600	all their medical data and give them advice in empathic fashion how far is that see a couple
3563600	3569680	of years if we focus maybe even like next year and that's amazing because all of these topics
3570240	3575280	that again we will have diagnosis that it's superior we will have research augmentation
3575280	3578880	because again even researchers don't have all that knowledge of their fingertips and again
3578880	3584400	this is public infrastructure in a public good you know from primary care all the way through so
3584400	3588800	that what is the open infrastructure in the future where this technology can come again
3588800	3594000	to your own data as well you have things like melody and other things around homomorphic
3594000	3598320	encryption federated learning that they were trying to figure out how to preserve privacy
3598320	3603760	we can run a language model on a smart phone right now that can analyze all your data and then
3603760	3608560	just feedback stuff to a global collective but people are people so when I look at health care
3608560	3613920	I see amazing data sets that we can activate by taking the models to the data an infrastructure
3613920	3619360	that we can build like we had checks agent with stanford the top x-ray radio radiology model
3620160	3625600	to build good standard things across the entire gamut of health care so we actually get to health
3625600	3630400	care versus sick care so we can make it so that everyone is empowered to make the best decisions
3630400	3635760	either as experts or individuals and make it so nobody is alone again as well as increasingly
3635760	3642640	data quality that will then feed better models that will then save lives save suffering and again
3642640	3647840	increase our potential like you've got a long job wrong stupid behind you right why don't you have
3647840	3654400	all the latest knowledge of longevity at your fingertips at a gpt4 level right now that will
3654400	3658720	happen over the next year we will launch stable health or whatever decide to call it and there
3658720	3663120	will be the smartest people in each of these areas working on that so again you're never like
3663120	3669920	doesn't matter if you're with a hundred billion dollars and your kid has autism ast there's no cure
3669920	3675040	there's no treatment there's nothing doesn't matter how rich you are yet we're just a little bit of
3675040	3680240	effort right now we can build it as an open infrastructure for the five percent of people
3680240	3684880	in the world that know someone with autism the fifty percent of people in the world that receive
3684880	3689680	a cancer diagnosis of them or someone they love and they feel that loss of agency so we're going to
3689680	3695200	return agency to humanity that way and again it needs to be an open infrastructure that they can
3695200	3700960	then access private datasets and compensate them appropriately so everyone is incentivized we get
3700960	3708080	that fast yeah and and that's a beautiful vision it is again infrastructure it and one of the things
3708080	3713600	that's so beautiful about it is guess what all eight billion people we're all human we're all
3713600	3719600	running the same software and the the the breakthroughs and the knowledge accumulated in
3720480	3726800	you know in Kazakhstan is going to be as useful in Kansas yeah but this is the thing operating
3726800	3731360	system this is the biggest upgrade to the human operating system we can imagine because we're
3731360	3737920	going from analog to digital text is black and white whereas this these models only understand
3738000	3744240	context you know daniel kahneman just passed you know amazing kind of guy but you know he did
3744240	3749680	have this concept of type one type two thinking and so we had one which is these big data things that
3749680	3754000	can only extrapolate but now we have these models that understand context and so we have the missing
3754000	3758960	part of the brain and that will allow us to extrapolate allows to have more rainbows you
3758960	3763760	know have the context of each individual push intelligence to the edge and that's why again
3763760	3769120	there is this imperative to do this now because there's a window on the freedom agency democracy
3769120	3773600	side but the other imperative is no one should have to suffer as they're suffering now
3775280	3779840	amazing and how much does actually it doesn't need that much which is the really amazing stuff
3780400	3784640	this the total amount spent in janitor bail i think i said at the conference is less than
3785200	3788160	the total amount spent on the los angeles san francisco railway
3788800	3795440	which hasn't even started yet and and in building stable health again if that's what it's called i
3795440	3801360	mean the amount of capital required to build that is de minimis compared to what's spent on a single
3801360	3808880	human trial of any any drug yeah it is but then you know you build it and you get to that 8020
3808880	3813360	incredibly quickly that will change hundreds of millions of lives and that will attract the smartest
3813360	3816240	people in each of these areas thinking about what is the open infrastructure of multiple
3816320	3823920	sclerosis of longevity of cancer and more but then you can amp that because the value is so so huge
3824880	3830560	and you i hope to build a trusted organization as part of this whole human operating system upgrade
3830560	3834400	you know that's what i want to build i want to build human os well at least catalyze it again i
3834400	3839520	don't want to run or control or own anything i want to figure out how to give back that control
3839520	3844000	because who should decide what cancer knowledge goes in there who should decide what education etc
3844000	3851120	let's talk about the second half of your of your vision which is how we originally met
3851680	3857120	when you were one of the winners of the global learning x prize that ilan and tony
3858080	3865120	robbins had had co-funded your your vision around education to speak to us about that
3866000	3869760	yeah you know so we're deploying it kind of the winners kind of separate but
3870720	3875760	every child right my entire operating system is like if you think about things in terms of
3875760	3881200	the rights of child and today they have no agency and so we must respect their rights climate
3881200	3886400	everything becomes a lot simpler now that we have language models on a laptop like i said you can go
3886400	3893600	to lmstudio.ai download stable lm and it will run on your macbook faster than you can read
3893920	3900720	uh it's crazy we can have a gpt 4 level ai from us or someone else on a smartphone or a tablet by
3900720	3907040	next year one laptop per child was too early you know now we have this transformative technology
3907040	3911840	you have an ai that teaches the child learns from a child are you visual auditory dyslexic
3911840	3917520	that's the best data in the world for a national model but also to teach these models how to be
3918480	3925360	optimistic how to this really is this really is uh the young ladies illustrator primer this
3925360	3932560	really is neil stevensson's vision in that regard yeah but mel shouldn't have had to find the primer
3933200	3941040	she should have had it from day one as a human right as a human right yes our school's education
3941040	3947280	system our child care mixed with the social status game mix with petri dish you know they teach our
3947280	3953200	kids not to have agency yes whereas they should be telling the kids yeah yeah they should be teaching
3953200	3958320	this is a relic of the industrial age where everyone had to be counted and you can't measure
3958320	3964240	what you can't manage so you manage the creativity and belief out of people everyone in the world can
3964240	3969040	do anything why because even if you don't have that talent you can convince someone else who
3969040	3974400	does have that talent but they don't believe it so they can't do it so what happens if we have an
3974480	3980160	entire nation of children that have this helper that brings the right information the right time
3980160	3986160	and tells them they can always believe that supports them entire world what can't you do
3986880	3990560	you know then they have all of the cancer knowledge of their fingertips and all of the
3990560	3995760	engineering knowledge of their fingertips and it's a constantly learning adaptive and improving system
3996560	4003600	again right now almost the entire agi and ai debate is about these machine gods trained on giant
4003600	4009200	supercomputers that bestow their beneficence down or may kill us or whatever what about that human
4009200	4014160	operating system upgrades that is a decentralized intelligence where that kid in mongolia or malawi
4014160	4019440	or wherever can make a real difference to humanity some of the contributors to our open code basis for
4019440	4025440	our models are 15 years old and they just taught themselves and just happen to be their wizards
4025440	4030160	you don't know in this new age right and again they should contribute to the whole because
4030160	4035200	once something goes into this model of the system and again it needs the verification and other
4035200	4040960	things that can be dynamic they can proliferate to everyone using that system do you think that
4040960	4049360	once this capability is built it will run into blocks in different nations or do you imagine
4049360	4057520	that this will become a again a human right and not all need I mean listen there's no greater gift
4057600	4064640	and no greater asset you can give to a nation's populist than intelligence and education but I'm
4064640	4070720	not sure every national leader wants to see that and that's why I think again there is a gap here
4071360	4077120	there is a year maybe where you can go to any national leader and say I'll bring this technology
4077120	4081440	to your people and I will empower the smart stupid people I want to be earned by the people
4081440	4086160	and what option do they have this is positive for them what happens is that a lot of the
4086160	4090960	corruption in the world is because of local maxima you know actually it's weird because
4090960	4095040	unpredictable corruption is the worst predictable corruption is a bit like tax you know there's
4095040	4099200	a good boast book by Frosso a job about Harvard about this and then you have taxation kicking
4099200	4104800	at 14 percent if you can show them something bigger and this is clearly big they will embrace
4104800	4108640	this technology and set new norms and if you correct the same across all these countries
4108640	4113360	with talented individuals in each of those groups and talented individuals in each of those sectors
4113360	4118400	with a shared mission even though they're separate organizations that's how you set amazing
4118400	4123920	standards that's how you build a network effect and if you tie them all together with a intelligent
4123920	4128080	protocol and you want to talk about tokens or speculation or ramps or anything like that
4128080	4134720	but taking the best of thinking around coordination that can work that can break this open you know
4136480	4140400	but it's not going to be everywhere and also when you look at the current debate the current
4140400	4147200	debate is for example we can't let China have this technology and you're like what about the kids in
4147200	4152800	China right well you know it's dangerous they can have a giant so under what circumstance would China
4152800	4158880	ever have this technology never you know Pakistan when should they have the tech never that's really
4158880	4162080	what they're kind of saying it's also self-defeating because China has a hundred million people they
4162080	4167040	can use to create data sets and two exaplops of computers let's put that to the side again it's
4167040	4172000	a very western oriented debate whereas actually if you go to these countries and you talk to the
4172000	4177360	leaders and the family officers that have power and the people they will leapfrog in the global
4177360	4184080	south to an intelligence augmentation like they let frog to mobile they want to embrace this technology
4184080	4189120	and again you can set norms now versus what's going to happen is you know they will get a
4189120	4194560	centralized solution they'll adopt that instead if you don't right now for hundreds of millions
4194560	4202320	billions of people that's why i think again it's a crossroads um is there anybody else working
4202320	4208960	towards this solution that you know of no in the in the large ai town no certainly no one
4208960	4213280	credibility and again that's why i had to build these models you know and i had to kind of do
4213280	4218960	this everyone's working on tiny parts of this but there is expecting emergence build it and
4218960	4222560	somehow it will spread and again this is why i found it fascinating the web3 community
4222560	4226400	there are good people in there and i hope to be able to unite them just like hope to unite the
4226400	4230720	people in health and others and peter you've seen people working on tiny parts of this
4231440	4235040	but this isn't a manhattan project where we're facing an enemy
4235040	4241040	unless the enemy is ourselves you know but this does require this big global coordinated push and
4241040	4246000	that's why i've tried to design this system that i believe will work because all about the talent
4246000	4249760	and is multiplicative is the race against uh
4252080	4259280	overly powerful centralized ai systems that achieve some version of agi is that what we're racing against
4263360	4269200	yeah again we're racing against ourselves like um humans can scale through stories you have
4269200	4274400	organizations you know come and join a band and come and go to oxford come and do this but then
4275360	4280240	when we scaled through text text was a lossy information format and there's this poem by
4280240	4284320	ginsburg how about this carthaginian demon of disorder mollock that comes in
4285360	4289040	mollock comes in through the data loss our organizations are slow dummy eyes
4289680	4294320	but now what's happening is they're configuring to achieve the thing of getting more and more power
4294320	4300080	again corporations are technically a people under law but they're not fully formed people
4300080	4305120	they eat our hopes and dreams so i believe the competition here is against those organizations
4305120	4310560	consolidating too much power and creating norms that almost impossible to break so we're almost
4310560	4315760	competing against ourselves and again the question is this do you believe it amplified human
4315760	4319680	intelligence or do you believe in artificial general intelligence do you believe in collective
4319680	4326160	intelligence or do you believe in collected intelligence who decides is this infrastructure
4326800	4334640	or is this a product like so it's not like a Manhattan project against you know the soviets
4334640	4341920	or anything like that but it is is require us all to come together or at least the smartest people
4341920	4347040	in each of these areas from coordination to government systems to health care to education
4347600	4352000	with a blank slate of how do we upgrade the human operating system the time is now
4352000	4357760	it's all lost chance to do it and i and i i love you for it because i think you're you're right
4358640	4366960	you were there when elan beamed in on xx video over starlink and from his airplane which is
4366960	4374320	which was a fun moment and we were talking about the rate of growth and his his statement
4374960	4378400	because you know recurrence why was there talking about his still his prediction of
4378880	4386720	agi by 2029 and ray and written elan saying we'll have agi whatever that means by next year and
4387440	4394960	and the intelligence of the entire human race by 2029 so i am i am curious what just to close
4394960	4403120	out what you think about that those timelines and that potential for a super intelligent
4403680	4410000	agi system that is centralized because that's the people who are building that level of power
4410000	4416400	are building centralized systems they're building centralized single systems that again take our
4416400	4421520	collective intelligence like all of youtube in the case of open ai clearly and other things
4421520	4427440	and they package it up sell it back to us but they don't care you know these organizations
4427440	4431440	are trying to build a system that will take away our freedom liberty and potentially kill us all
4431440	4438240	let's be kind of fair about that and sell it to us on an incremental basis the selling to us
4438240	4443680	is a complete cannot they don't care about the revenue of this again let's kind of call a spade
4443680	4449520	a spade they're telling you that they're building something that could kill you and something that
4449520	4453760	could remove all our freedom and liberty and they're saying it's a good thing you should back
4453760	4458720	them because it's cool it's not it's actually shameful if you think about it and we should
4458720	4461360	not stand for it anymore and again this is another reason i want to step aside to see you
4461360	4466000	because you can't say things like that i don't cancel until i can rally so many times but realistically
4466000	4471920	it's ridiculous and it should not be stood for but they're going to do it anyway because they have
4471920	4477920	the political power people are scared of them so there has to be an alternative and the alternative
4477920	4483680	has to be distributed intelligence when i resigned i said you can't beat centralized intelligence
4483680	4487120	decentralized intelligence you're not going to beat it with this stability the least of great
4487120	4492160	organization it's going to do well the only way that you can beat it to create the standard that
4492160	4499520	represents humanity is decentralized intelligence it's collective intelligence and the data sets
4499520	4506240	and norms from that will be ones that help children that helps people suffering that reflect our
4506240	4512960	moral upstanding and the best of us and gathers the best of us to do it because if you work in
4512960	4517680	healthcare if you work in education if you work in finance if you work in any of these things there's
4517680	4524080	no organization for you to come and join or partner with on this there's no kind of centralized mission
4524080	4528000	i have looked i've wanted to help other people i didn't want to do this to myself and i don't want
4528000	4532320	it to be about being very very quickly and so i'm kind of getting it out there now i hope that i can
4532320	4537840	capitalize something that then people will take forward and time is now for that because agi when
4537840	4542400	it comes if it comes again there's various definitions of this why on earth do you need any
4542400	4549360	knowledge workers anything that can be done via a laptop doesn't need humans and so you have concepts
4549360	4555680	of ubi here you have concept like when agi comes you don't need money money is a common story is a
4555680	4561520	common good we hear total post capitalist society and i think the example i think you said was a
4561600	4566720	star trek versus man max you know i'm like star trek versus star wars i think there's a
4570560	4576560	and so you know the sith lords and all of that um but again if you kind of look at this i don't
4576560	4581520	think we need money like it's cross contextual like bartering with our ai systems representing us
4582160	4588160	or it's you don't need money because you're told what to do again our governments the definition
4588160	4593440	of a government is the entity with the monopoly on political violence and an agi can overtake any
4593440	4598560	government that they can then control the people because again listen to it whispering look at the
4598560	4604400	kind of human thing so we have this opportunity to set norms right now the way that the big labs
4604400	4610400	are going to agi is likely to kill us all elon and i signed that six month pause letter because even
4610400	4614480	though people like emma do an acceleration as you put all this open source aia you have to think
4614480	4618720	about the other side and who's involved in that discussion and again if we build an agi as a
4618720	4627120	centralized thing is windows or linux safer as infrastructure our entire internet infrastructure
4627120	4634320	is built on open open can be challenged open can be augmented a monolith is like to be crazy and
4634320	4641120	the way that i put this is we all night both know so many geniuses you know side effect of genius
4641200	4647920	is insanity honestly we're not men geniuses are not mentally stable why would you expect an agi
4647920	4653760	to be so and you're putting all your ends in one basket versus creating a complex hierarchical system
4654640	4659200	that is a hive mind that's the intelligence that represents us all we should be working
4659200	4664720	towards building that and it's safer it's better it achieves all the benefits that people are talking
4664720	4669760	about and it's possible today do you think elon shares in this vision of a decentralized ai do
4669760	4674240	you think he would play in that area and do you think any of the national leaders that you've
4674240	4680560	been speaking to would support that kind of a vision as well um yeah i can't speak for elon
4680560	4684640	i'll speak to him and see what he thinks and then i'll get back to you know he always says what he
4684640	4689920	thinks um but you know he's immensely concerned he was one of the leaders in this area saying
4689920	4695120	originally why google you know now why in microsoft open ai like it can't be centralized but it's
4695120	4699680	difficult it's a difficult question how many people have a feasible solution or you've even
4699680	4704000	thought about this properly you and i both know just not many and that's very sad it should be
4704000	4709120	everyone thinking about this on the leader side all the leaders i've met are super happy you know
4709120	4717040	because they again leaders want power they want control and all of this but generally like they
4717040	4722800	want to see a bundles they're not happy with where their countries are and embracing this technology
4722800	4727520	they know they can leap ahead and you know they will still have a say in all of this it's not like
4727520	4734480	it's kicking them out or removing them there are still various kind of mechanisms there and ultimately
4734480	4740720	improving the health education and capability of your people is not a bad thing i mean like obviously
4740720	4745120	i haven't talked to the completely oppressive leaders you know maybe that'll be an interesting thing
4745120	4749360	but honestly i don't want to even be talking to leaders i want to create again a system
4749440	4752880	that the people of the country coming together with the franchise system
4752880	4757280	can then build this technology for the good of their people in the open and not be reliant on
4757280	4761200	anyone politically or any other thing like that so you don't need giant super computers for where
4761200	4767840	we're going recordination need a few giant super computers yeah what's your timeline for putting
4767840	4774560	out this white paper i'm working as hard as i can you know i've held i've held i've held you to this
4774560	4779360	a number of times i've said get the vision out there it's getting there we're about to go off
4779360	4783680	this call to a four-hour session to dictate all the various bits and pieces and again it was
4783680	4788000	impossible when i was a CEO of stability there was always another fire there's always another thing
4788000	4792720	i didn't have time to think you know and i hope people can take that white paper and make it better
4792720	4797120	i don't have all the answers i'm just trying to capitalize something man i think after i heard you
4797120	4804720	step down i wrote you a text saying congratulations yeah exactly talk to miserations time to time
4804720	4814320	to feel unleashed yeah yeah uh imad thank you my friend uh thank you for sharing uh where you are
4814320	4820080	what led up to this where you're going next and uh and really pulling the gloves off on discussing
4820080	4829200	the idea of centralized closed ai systems and their dangers uh and the importance of of the
4829200	4835200	vision that you've portrayed because i'm i'm fully supportive and fully believe that what you've laid
4835200	4843760	out um is probably one of the most seen visions of ai in the future that i've heard i hope other
4843760	4849440	people agree you know and they can take it forward other real heroes thank you thank you pal
