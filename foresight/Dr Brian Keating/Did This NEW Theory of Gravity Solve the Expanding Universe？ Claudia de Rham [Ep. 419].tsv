0	4160	What if there was an idea, a new theory of gravity that could bridge the gap between
4160	9680	our predictions and observations of the most mysterious substance in the universe,
9680	10560	dark energy?
10560	15680	Everything connects with gravity, everything lives in your spacetime.
15680	20560	Dark energy is a force that scientists believe is causing the expansion of the universe to
20560	24160	not only increase, but to do so at an accelerating rate.
24160	28080	But there are discrepancies between the predicted amounts of dark energy in the universe
28080	33200	and our theoretical calculations based on the properties of the fundamental particles
33200	34240	that we know and love.
34240	39440	We're trying to get to the bottom of this for years, almost 30 years without success.
39440	44080	That is, until today's guests, Professor Claudia Duran proposed a new theory of massive
44080	49920	gravity that could explain why the universe is accelerating and also solve the impossible
49920	51120	dark energy puzzle.
51120	56080	It's really in asking ourselves provocative questions just like you do that we make progress.
56080	62880	Join Claudia and me as we fall headfirst into the dark side of the universe to uncover
62880	69280	its most seemingly impossible mysteries and turn the impossible into the inevitable.
69280	69920	Let's go.
69920	71360	Claudia, how are you doing today?
72080	72880	Well, I'm great.
72880	73200	Thank you.
73200	74000	How are you, Brian?
74000	76400	I'm excellent now that I get a chance to talk to you.
76400	81840	We have a lot in common, but I'm going to start first with a rather provocative question.
81840	88640	If you'll indulge me, a lot of this book and a lot of your work corresponds to the desire to find
89200	94000	a solution to the so-called mass of the graviton.
94000	100080	I want to start by asking you, why should we care about finding the mass or attributing mass
100080	104640	to a particle whose existence we don't even know for sure about?
105280	107840	So that's many, many different reasons.
107840	113360	The first one, I would say, which is going to convince the few people, but is the truth,
113360	118560	is because we as human care about understanding nature at the most fundamental level, and so
118560	122400	we should really always dive deeper and deeper.
123120	124320	That's how we make progress.
125280	130400	Sometimes it's really in asking ourselves provocative questions just like you do that
130400	136160	we make progress and questions that may not have a specific outcome for tomorrow,
136160	140560	but it typically has shaped us, shaped the future of humanity.
140560	143200	That is really the real reason.
143200	148800	But then there's many other reasons I can tell you of why I went into that specific question.
150240	155520	First, let me just say that it's about understanding whether a fundamental particle,
155520	163200	which we may never detect per se, has a mass, but it has an implication also on gravitation
163200	169280	waves, which we do have, we have observed, and actually from the very first detection of
169280	175840	direct detection of gravitational waves here on Earth in 2015, the very one thing,
175840	181760	the first thing that they were able to do is put an upper limit on how massive the
181760	186320	graviton was because it has an effect on the propagation of gravitational waves.
186880	192480	So now that limit is still quite high as compared to what we ideally would like it to be,
193680	195520	for the reasons I'll explain.
195520	200800	But still, in principle, it has some real consequences that we can observe here on Earth
200800	204800	through gravitational waves and through many different tests of gravity,
204800	210640	tests of the universe, tests of why we're here, where we're going, our origin, and all of those
210640	211280	questions.
211280	217200	Why I am interested, why I spend my time looking at that as opposed to all sorts of other fundamental
217200	224560	questions, is because I think it has a potential to tackle the most challenging question of
224560	230000	fundamental physics, the biggest discrepancy of the whole history of science, which is
230800	232880	the cosmological constant problem.
232880	239920	Or in other words, why are we living in an universe that looks the way it does and is
239920	247040	not actually expanding at an accelerated rate, which is way faster by at least 56 orders of
247040	254560	magnitude, if not 120 orders of magnitude, as should be the case if the quantum fluctuations
254560	260720	from all the fields that we know exist, like the electrons and the Higgs and all of those fields,
260720	265280	all of those are the fundamental particles that made us so really exist.
265280	272400	We would expect them to lead to what we call an energy in the vacuum, an energy of nothingness
273120	280560	that fills the whole universe itself and should lead to a hugely faster accelerated
280560	282640	rate of expansion of the universe.
282640	287920	The discrepancy is simply the biggest discrepancy in the whole history of science.
288560	294560	And that is at the interface of the two pillars of modern theoretical physics,
294560	301280	modern science, which on one side is gravity, on the other side is field theory, quantum field
301280	305920	theory, putting the two together, which is really the foundation of the standard model
305920	308240	of particle physics as we know it today.
308240	312560	And so it's very much at the interface between the two of them that we have the biggest discrepancy
312560	314160	we can ever imagine.
314160	319760	And so it seems natural that the resolution is very much at the interface between the two
319760	324960	of them, thinking of gravity, thinking of gravity as well as a quantum field theory
324960	329760	and understanding what are the properties of gravity more fundamentally.
330720	337760	So recently, the DESI collaboration made an announcement that there seems to be evidence
337760	343680	for the variation of the cosmological constant from constant to perhaps a contestant-like
343680	344320	behavior.
344320	347280	Can you tell me how would that impact the statement you just made?
347280	353760	Would it affect the search or the motivation to look for a massive graviton?
353840	359840	So it is within the same framework that something has to be slightly different as compared to the
359840	365840	standard I'll call lambda CDM or vanilla model for the cosmological paradigm,
365840	371760	which we would just think until now everything seemed to fit beautifully with having called
371760	375440	dark matter and a simple cosmological constant.
375440	380400	So very natural in that evolution sense.
380480	387040	In a parameter sense, it's very simple in that sense, but actually in understanding how that
387040	391600	fits in in the bigger picture is that's where the real naturalist question is coming.
392560	399040	And so if there's any departure from this lambda CDM, it really opens up the opportunity
399040	404400	for there to be something else out there and any modification of gravity could feed into that,
404400	407280	any dynamical dark energy could feed into that.
407280	410800	And sometimes there's a little bit of a muchness on how much you consider
411920	413840	modified gravity and dark energy.
413840	420720	You get some models of modification of gravity can be recaptured in effectively looking for
420720	426480	cosmological purposes as a dynamical cosmological constant or dynamical,
426480	429840	shouldn't say cosmological constant, but dynamical dark energy.
430480	435760	So for instance, if you have a theory of massive gravity and you want to tackle the
435760	441360	cosmological constant problem with that, you would want to accept that the universe is filled
441360	447200	with vacuum energy as expected from particle physics, but this huge level of vacuum energy
447200	451920	doesn't lead to a huge accelerated rate of the universe today.
451920	457840	It did in the past, but then through the weakening of gravity due to the mass of the
457840	462880	graviton, through the evolution of the universe, you would have a relaxation of the effect
463440	466880	of this vacuum energy on the evolution of the universe.
466880	472080	So in some sense, it does look like a dynamical or cosmological constant and that seems paradoxical,
472080	475360	but the source would be constant in some sense.
475360	478560	It would be vacuum energy, it would be a cosmological constant,
478560	483280	but then its effect on gravity, its effect on the evolution of the universe would be
483280	487840	dynamical, it would be deleted, relaxed our way through the evolution of the universe.
488400	494560	We would expect in this type of departure from the standard Lambda CD and the standard
494560	499840	cosmological constant. So some of your work in this book, which we will now play my favorite
499840	505920	game about called Judging Books by Their Cover, is about a topic near and dear to my heart,
505920	511200	the cosmic microwave background and the subject of polarization. But before we get there, I want
511200	515360	us to indulge ourselves in this game that I call Judging Books by Their Cover.
515360	519120	So Claudia, please, if you would, take us through the beautiful artwork,
519120	522240	the title and the subtitle of this wonderful book.
522240	529840	Okay. So the title is The Beauty of Falling and the subtitle A Life in Pursuit of Gravity.
529840	534160	And I'm really happy to guess what I mean by all of those things, which is a lot.
534160	539760	But I'm very happy with The Cover, actually, because it's very symbolic of the story.
539760	544240	There is a real story in the book. And so on The Cover, you start seeing on the top
544800	551760	an astronaut, an astronaut floating in mid-air, experiencing some level of free falling and
551760	557920	some freedom, very much some freedom in that. And then in the middle, you see the same person,
557920	566160	I think, Ali, each falling now. You can imagine she's falling. She's falling on earth. She's
566160	571760	really embracing some level of free fall. There's probably some friction from the air because she's
571760	577520	falling on earth, but she's enjoying it. There's a beauty in the fall itself. The fall itself is
577520	585040	beautiful. Maybe what comes next is what was a bit more worrying. But luckily for her, the last
585040	591680	picture, the bottom is her diving in the sea and really enjoying this last part of the free fall
591680	598320	and seeing how this channel, how this falling has been channeling through a different perspective,
598320	605040	now enjoying playing with gravity as she dives in the ocean and enjoying this new environment.
605040	609280	The subtitle is as beautiful. And of course, a lot of these things on The Cover that this
609840	616640	character is experiencing are relevant to you. The first one being astronaut, which you have
617200	625040	attempted to be from the European Space Agency sign. The middle one is you flying, maybe doing a
625040	629440	dive, but there's an airplane in the back. You and I are both pilots. I don't know how much you
629440	638080	fly nowadays, but I have flown a diamond katana before. Yeah, amazing. I know that. I have a
638080	643520	picture of it there. I'm not going to tell the screen right now, but it's a love that happened.
643520	649200	It just wants to fly. It's amazing. It just pulls the nose up and it wants to fly. It's incredible.
649200	654560	And then there's a woman ends up underwater wearing a scuba diving suit. And that takes
654560	660080	me to my first question from my guest, from a not a guest, an audience member who is a very
660080	666480	special person to both of us. His name is Professor Greg Gabadadze, who is not only a friend and a
666480	672720	brilliant scientist and innovator, truly just one of my heroes in science. He's also an administrator
673600	679440	at NYU, a dean. I don't know what masochistic desire he had to do that. He's from Georgia,
679440	683840	not the state, but the country of Georgia. So, you know, they make tough, tough people. They're
683840	688560	brilliant and tough. But Greg asked me to ask you when I solicited a question. He said, thanks
688560	692960	for reaching out. Claudia wrote a wonderful book with a clear and modern perspective on physics
692960	696720	and also connected to remarkable personal experiences. And I have a fun question for
696720	701200	Claudia. I'd ask her if there might be any advantage to thinking about physics while
701200	708160	floating in the cosmos or underwater. And I want to get your answer to that, Gregory's question.
708160	714480	In both ways, I think, being a theoretical physicist and thinking about quite abstract
714480	721280	concepts, I think there is a beauty in doing that when you fly, when you dive, you float in the
721280	726720	cosmos in embracing this understanding of nature at a deeper level. There is a deep connection that
726720	731680	gets there. But also the other way around, of course, I would like to tell you that I'm an
731680	739600	astronaut and I'm doing experiences about gravity in the microgravity on free fall
740320	745920	and orbit around the earth. It hasn't happened. And I'm not doing that when I'm scuba diving.
745920	753360	I'm not doing some explicit state of the art test of gravity when I do that. But I do it with my
753440	763600	body. And I think there is, as you say, Gregory is a very top guy. And I'm not saying that we
763600	770240	should all be very tough, but there is some level in which learning to have this balance between
770880	780240	judging your instinct, judging your intuition in very challenging situations, but also seeing how
780240	787440	much you can judge intuition and how much you have to rely on your confidence to follow a pattern,
787440	793520	to follow the logic, to follow scientific rules in situations where actually your instinct
794160	799200	naively would tell you to do something which would be quite catastrophic. And you are kind of to
799200	806160	you know that, for instance, if you're flying and you're stalling, naturally, if you hadn't had any
806160	811280	training, the first thing you would try to do is pull the nose up because you say you're going down,
811280	817840	you're going to pull the nose up so that you pick up altitude. But actually that decreases the lift
817840	825200	and so the plane sinks much more and that can actually lead to an accident. So following too
825200	834240	much instinct in these situations can lead to catastrophic outcomes. So if you learn to put
834320	840720	yourself in uncomfortable situations and have this balance between knowing what to do, there's a
840720	847360	level of instinct that you learn after having practiced it for hundreds of times, but also
847360	852720	is very much based on scientific understanding. You understand what you have to do logically,
852720	860240	that makes complete sense, and then you train yourself to learn the process in that. With your
860240	866000	body, a situation where your life depends on it, then you can do that on the blackboard so much
866000	871120	easier. Hey there, while Dark Energy is one of the most mysterious concepts in the known universe,
871120	876960	another mystery I'm trying to solve is why only 50% of you out there are subscribed to my YouTube
876960	883280	channel or following the podcast on your favorite podcast app. Are you one of them? Please don't
883280	889600	be in the silent majority. Do me a favor, subscribe, follow, and leave a comment or review. It really
889600	893920	helps me out and I respond to every single one. And when you do it, it helps me get great guests
893920	898720	like Claudia, Dan Dennett, Sam Harris. It's all a numbers game, unfortunately, and we have to make
898720	904320	sure the algorithm respects the matter that matters that we discussed on the Into the Impossible
904320	908960	podcast. So before we get back to the episode, just take a second and hit that subscribe button,
909520	915040	leave a comment or a thumbs up. Anything will help out. Appreciate it. Now back to the episode.
915040	919840	And that brings me to my next question, which is related to this gentleman who
919840	922960	features very prominently in this book, Albert Einstein.
925840	930640	Oh, you do? Okay, we can have a dueling one. So I'm going to do something mean to, which looks cruel,
930640	936000	but actually was one of his most exciting breakthroughs. In fact, he called this the
936000	941600	happiest thought of his life, which was that if he was following, he would experience no
941600	946960	gravitational force. And that led to the Einstein Equivalence Principle. And I want to ask this as
946960	953520	a first detour into your life as a professor and say that nowadays we hear a lot about artificial
953520	958480	intelligence and machine learning and all sorts of things. I think they're very powerful. But as a
958480	964240	professor, I think about, well, how could these things aid us? How could they be better researchers?
964240	970320	Could such an entity, artificial made of silicon and glass and steel and whatever else,
971040	977680	could it experience the joy of falling? Could it experience this most exhilarating feeling of Albert
977680	983920	Einstein? And then if it could experience that viscerally with a body, or if it could not rather
983920	988080	experience because it doesn't have a body, how could it make a breakthrough equivalent to what
988080	993600	Einstein, the greatest scientist of the last 100 years, perhaps, how could it even be considered
993600	999680	to be intelligent if it can't even do what Einstein did? I mean, it's a high bar. But do you think
999680	1004400	that physicists can be replaced or mimicked even by artificial intelligence?
1005200	1011840	I think there's no replacement. I think we've done so well at using things to our advantage. And
1011840	1017040	there's clear advantages to using national learning. It can speed up a lot of the things.
1017040	1024080	Now, when it comes to can it feel for us? That's a deep question. I can't do. Do I really feel
1024080	1029440	something or am I in a matrix and believe that I feel something? And how will I know the difference?
1029440	1037520	I don't know. I think related to your question is also how we model the world all around us.
1037520	1042720	If a computer is able to model the world, the universe and nature all around itself to
1043440	1050640	incredible precision, does it make it that this model is the reality or not? And there's a thin
1050640	1058320	line there sometimes. So your question makes me reminded of that. If a computer can reproduce all
1058320	1065680	the signs of what it means to feel something, does it make it feel it or not? You'd think not
1065680	1069280	because we are experiencing something deeper than that. But how can you tell? I don't know.
1075680	1083600	But I do think that there is a difference between spinning things up and reproducing,
1083600	1089120	relying on past understood patterns or past patterns that haven't necessarily been understood,
1089120	1098080	but have been identified and seeing them and being able to get some sense and logic and
1098080	1104880	organizing all of that, particularly when it comes to huge level of data, to speed up some
1104880	1112480	connection between some patterns and some model and some values that you want to take out of these
1112480	1117840	patterns or these data. There's a huge difference between doing that and actually coming up with a
1117840	1124720	breakthrough in itself, which requires a huge level of creativity. It's like all of a sudden
1124720	1131920	thinking you're going to paint the world, but not with pencils and paint, but using another dimension.
1131920	1138560	And it's something I can't even capture in words. And so if you haven't taught the machine
1138560	1146560	to think in that language, to use tools that will rely on the extra dimension, let me just
1146560	1152240	be crazy out there, how could it? I don't think you will out of the blue come up with things we
1152240	1159040	haven't ourselves yet invented with a completely new language. And so that level of creativity,
1159040	1166400	I think we will always have. And it's a little bit different. I should say that the response to
1166400	1170800	that, some people say that computers through machine learning, they can come up with new songs.
1171680	1177040	And so that shows some level of creativity. But those new songs are still within the same
1177040	1183600	remit of previous songs, still with music and notes, still within the same sense of that.
1183600	1188720	It will be quite different to have a sudden think of a new channel of communication, which is not
1188720	1194240	through sound, is not through light, is not even through gravitational waves. That would be something
1194240	1199360	yet completely different. And that's what we scientists are very good at, to think about
1199920	1206080	new ways to connect with the world. And in a 2020 paper published in PRD,
1206080	1211440	you described the speed of gravity. I always tell my students to their great horror,
1211440	1216880	the sun could disappear right now. And God forbid that happens, but we wouldn't know for eight minutes.
1216880	1221440	But is that really true? I mean, how do we know if that's actually true? So your paper,
1222080	1228560	the speed of gravity with Andrew Tolly at Imperial as well, makes a prediction that
1229440	1236560	the speed of gravity could differ from lowercase c. And I'm surprised. Why isn't this made a bigger
1236560	1244080	impact? Or are you even more famous than you are? You can imagine gravitational rain,
1244080	1250640	but it was where the speed of gravity does depend on the frequency, just like light
1250640	1256400	depends on the frequency. So not in the vacuum, not in empty space per se. For light, we can
1256400	1263680	understand. I can sort of conceive what empty space is, is the absence of interactions between light
1263680	1271600	and anything else. So we are used to the fact that light in space travels at the speed of light.
1271600	1278320	But if you shine light through water, for instance, then light will start interacting
1278320	1282960	slightly differently with the medium, with the water, with the water molecules,
1282960	1289520	depending on the frequency of light. And so you see that. And because of this interaction,
1289520	1295440	light doesn't travel at the speed of light in the vacuum in water, and the way it travels,
1295440	1300320	the speed at which it travels depends on its color. So we're all used to that phenomenon.
1300320	1306000	We all see rainbows, and that's the proof that light doesn't always travel at the speed of light.
1306000	1312480	So you can ask yourself the same question for gravity. And that's, you know, it's quite subtle
1312480	1319120	because now, what does it mean in empty space when actually everything connects with gravity?
1319120	1324960	Everything lives in your space time. And if a universe is filled with dark energy,
1325520	1331280	then is there such a thing as empty space? I don't know. And it could be that gravitational
1331280	1338400	waves do interact ever so slightly with anything living in that space time, including dark energy.
1338400	1342720	And if that were the case, then it would modify the speed of gravitational waves.
1343280	1350640	It would do so at very, very low frequencies. So if all of a sudden you were to take off the sun,
1351360	1359520	that would be kind of a high frequency, a high frequency thing. And so the propagation
1359520	1364720	of this information, well, you would expect it to take very close to eight minutes to reach to us
1364720	1368800	because at those frequencies, you would expect the speed of gravitational waves to be very,
1368800	1376080	very close to that of light. And another thing that would come concomitantly with such a phenomenon
1376080	1383520	would be additional polarization modes in addition to the so-called plus and cross modes that my
1384240	1387760	colleagues and I are trying to study in the cosmic microwave background.
1387760	1392480	Can you explain these types of new polarization states? There's a beautiful illustration in the
1392480	1397920	book about them, the so-called breathing one. That's very evocative. Can you explain what these
1397920	1405200	polarizations would do and why you manifest that you have to have new polarization states of gravity
1405200	1411760	if gravitational waves, or you call it glite, that will maybe catch on and supplement your salary
1411760	1418080	there. I hope so. I hope you get the trademark on that. But how would they manifest themselves?
1418080	1422320	How would a breathing mode manifest itself? And what would it look like in the power spectrum
1422320	1426720	of the CMB that my colleagues and I and the Simons Foundation have supported to the tune of over
1426720	1434000	$110 million so far? First of all, I think we will all sort of accept it that, for instance,
1434000	1439520	light itself comes in two polarizations and you put some very cool sunglasses and then you see
1439600	1444240	maybe one polarization and the other one gets filtered out. And we can ask the question already
1444240	1449360	for gravitational waves. Can you put some cool sunglasses for gravitational waves and only
1449360	1455600	you see one polarization or the other one? That would be a bit more challenging. But already,
1455600	1461040	yes, gravitational waves or what I like to call glite, because in some level it's quite similar
1461040	1467760	to light, comes already in two different flavors. And that's imposed by symmetry according to
1467760	1474800	Einstein's theory of general relativity. Now imagine that the gravitational waves
1474800	1480240	weren't traveling at the speed of light, very close to the speed of light, but not necessarily
1480240	1486800	weren't forced anymore to travel at the speed of light. Then you could, in principle, imagine some
1486800	1492720	sort of analog to sand waves, some longitudinal waves where you could have some gravitational
1492720	1497440	waves speeding up a little bit and slowing down a little bit. So these would be modes
1497520	1502640	which would not look like the standard gravitational waves, the cross and the plus,
1503280	1507360	which are transfers to the line of propagation of the gravitational waves.
1507360	1511520	They would actually be along the line of propagation of the gravitational waves.
1512080	1518560	So that mode, we typically don't like it, but that's a different story. It's just to illustrate
1518560	1524640	the fact that you open up a whole set of other possibilities once you allow yourself to sink
1524640	1530080	beyond the box, beyond not that I want to put Einstein's inner box, but beyond the theory of
1530080	1535520	Einstein's theory of general relativity. And so in addition to this longitudinal loads,
1535520	1540240	you also have some modes which are in between. So they are a little bit, they're halved through
1540240	1546640	the transverse direction and halved through the longitudinal direction. And also related to that,
1546640	1552640	you could have, you can now start imagining quite different things where rather than just have the
1552640	1557440	plus and the cross mode transfers to the propagation, you could have a breathing mode,
1557440	1563920	really just think about breathing. And if you think of some beads distributed along the circle,
1564880	1572400	as the mode, that mode goes through, they would sort of become, seem to suggest a bigger circle
1572400	1578080	and then come to a smaller circle and bigger circle and smaller circle. There's something quite
1578720	1585920	pacific about that. I like this picture, it makes me feel meditating as that mode goes through.
1586480	1592720	That mode is actually very important in any theory of gravity beyond Einstein's theory of
1592720	1599280	gravity, because that is typically expected to be the smoking gun signature for a theory beyond
1599840	1606160	Einstein's theory of general relativity. That mode, the real question is why isn't it there
1606160	1610240	in Einstein's theory of general relativity? You could expect it to be there in principle.
1610240	1615120	And it's not because of symmetry. Einstein's theory of general relativity was based on the
1615120	1621120	equivalence principle and on some other principles that nowadays we understand them as being
1621120	1628240	symmetry driven and that symmetry simply prevents this conformal breathing mode from appearing.
1629120	1635840	Now you can think if the graviton had a mass, you can always make that mass sufficiently small.
1635920	1642960	So that you don't see any departure. And that is true, that is true in principle. However,
1643760	1650640	because now there are additional polarization for gravitational waves, you can think about having
1650640	1655360	different ways to communicate through gravity. There's different channels of communication
1655360	1662000	through gravity. And that has a big impact in how we're testing gravity. As you say that would mean,
1662000	1666720	it could mean for instance that at the very beginning of the universe, you could have production
1666720	1671680	of not only primordial gravitational waves as the one you're thinking about,
1671680	1678480	which would lead to valorizations in the CMB. But you could also think of production of primordial
1678480	1684480	gravitational waves in this breathing mode. Now this breathing mode in itself, from a cosmological
1684480	1690240	perspective, it wouldn't be during inflation, it wouldn't necessarily look so dissimilar to the
1690240	1696880	inflaton itself or to the other field that are already present and whose effect has already been
1696880	1703920	seen and printed in the CMB through the temperature fluctuations. So actually, there are models out
1703920	1710960	there of massive gravity for the very beginning of the universe, where this additional polarization
1710960	1718560	of the gravitational waves do act potentially as a substitute for the inflaton. And for the
1718560	1726400	fluctuations in those, those primordial breathing mode polarizations would lead to the temperature
1728000	1732400	fluctuations that we do see in the in the cosmic microwave background, for instance.
1732400	1738320	So would there be a modification to the BB mode power spectrum, the autocorrelation, or would it
1738320	1745200	induce new forbidden correlations, EB correlations, would it change the shape of the autocorrelation?
1745280	1748960	Is there some way to detect it, you know, because these are the only, this is all you have, right?
1748960	1754080	You make the case in the, in the, in the book that beyond the, beyond the, you know, realm of the
1754080	1758880	galaxy or even clusters, there's no hope of discovering physics of gravity at the Planck scale,
1758880	1764400	other than inflation, if inflation did take place, we don't know that it did. Some of us hope that it
1764400	1770320	did, but we've had that, we've had that dream before. But the question is, are there new observable
1770320	1775200	signatures that we can use to detect the presence or absence of a massive graviton or and the
1775200	1779440	concomitant breathing modes that would also be induced in novel polarization states?
1779440	1786480	Yeah. So that's a great question. One of the things that would happen is if the, if the mass of
1786480	1792240	a graviton is a little bit too large, if you imagine you have a graviton being too massive,
1792240	1798560	then it would prevent the, prevent the production of primordial gravitational waves whose frequency
1798560	1805280	are comparable as the mass of the graviton during the, the period where they should have been produced.
1805280	1810720	So in effect, what you would expect in the power spectrum of primordial
1811760	1817120	polarization, or of primordial gravitational waves, let me say, of b-mode polarization,
1817120	1824080	you would expect a plateau. You wouldn't expect any production of primordial gravitational waves
1824080	1831120	at very low L because those would be forbidden by the, the fact that the, the graviton
1831120	1835680	prevents the production of primordial gravitational waves within that, those scales.
1836400	1843120	So seeing actually the production of primordial gravitational waves or CMB polarization, b-mode
1843920	1849680	spectrum at very low L, that would be assigned against massive gravity, against a massive
1849680	1855200	graviton, against massive polarizations during the period of concentration.
1855200	1858320	One thing that people don't talk about as much, I mean, people don't talk about this
1859280	1864400	massive gravitons very much either, but, but comparatively, even if you can imagine, even
1864400	1869760	less attention is paid to the existence of spin three halves particles. We have a spin zero
1869760	1874480	particles, we have abundance of those, we have a lot of spin one halves, thank God, or you and I
1874480	1879040	wouldn't be here talking, we have plenty of light, you know, with an L and no G in front of it,
1879040	1884160	we even have hopes of glite with spin, but the absent, you know, the, the so-called black sheep,
1884160	1889840	maybe the missing, you know, missing, missing term, missing spin statistic term,
1889840	1895120	it's been three halves. Why? What, what did nature do to so alienate one of the
1895920	1900320	most prominent types of fundamental intrinsic spin modes that could possibly exist?
1900320	1904880	Yeah, it's a good question. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I mean,
1905840	1910400	those particles, not at the fundamental level, but at composite level, they do, they do exist,
1910400	1915520	so we know they can't be represented to some level in nature, but having them as fundamental
1915520	1920960	particle, we know that then their interactions with other fields is, is very difficult and
1920960	1928000	their implementation within a theory of gravity is also very, very challenging. I know that for
1928000	1934400	spin two, and it's the same case for, for spin three half as well, the, the framework in which
1934400	1941280	you construct the, even the, the nonlinearities, the interactions for spin up to, up to one
1942480	1947280	is relatively straightforward, I would say, and the connection with gravity as well,
1947280	1952160	and it's relatively straightforward, but when you go beyond that, it becomes extremely complicated,
1952160	1958400	and Annie, you have to be very subtle in how you try to connect those modes with others,
1958400	1964880	how they communicate with others. You very easily open new channels of instabilities,
1964880	1970320	so it's not typically, you can just add some level of interactions, and you're okay with that.
1970320	1975760	As soon as you open up a smallest level of interaction, you need to reinvent the wheel,
1975760	1981680	if so says reinvent a whole framework to see how they embed into a deeper, a deeper one.
1981680	1985520	So that we see from the theoretical perspective how challenging it is.
1986480	1992080	And so maybe, maybe because of everything that comes along with it, it's much harder
1993040	1999280	for them to manifest themselves in nature. Hey there, dark matter is mysterious, but

2041520	2049840	Claudia D'Aram. Very interesting. I think another question that my listeners and viewers might have
2049840	2055280	is this concept of extra dimensions, which plays a big role in your research. Is there any
2056160	2062000	difference between when you speak about extra dimensions and when string theorists or fundamental
2062720	2067920	particle physicists speak about it? They both require or mandate the existence of these things,
2067920	2072720	which are as yet undetected, as you say in the book. So what is it? Are these extra dimensions
2073440	2076800	related to the extra dimensions of string theory? And if not, what are they?
2076800	2080320	The way I think about them doesn't preclude them from coming from string theory,
2080880	2086320	but actually the concept of extra dimension is a very, very old one. And within the framework
2086320	2095120	of general relativity, the same modern framework as in which we understand them today, they were
2095120	2101760	already proposed by Kalutza and Klein very, very shortly after the proposal of general
2101760	2107840	relativity. They have very natural extension of general relativity. They have sort of taken
2107840	2114560	a comeback since string theory, because string theory needs them, was if you don't think of string
2114560	2121760	theory, you can ask yourself as to why we live in a world where there is three dimensional space
2121760	2126560	and one of time, you can ask yourself why is that the case, but you don't necessarily believe that
2126560	2132000	there needs to be an additional one, extra one. Whereas in string theory, there needs to be extra
2132000	2138960	one, there's no choice on the matter. And then they are typically expected to be confined around
2138960	2145200	themselves, compactified, very small, very, very small extra dimensions, or there could be some
2145200	2153040	larger ones. And there we would be confined on a membrane and a brain, deep brain in those extra
2153040	2160640	dimensions. But a lot of my research in the way I've been thinking about it and looking at implications
2160640	2167200	for gravity and for cosmology, that was very much some of those ideas were motivated by string
2167200	2173360	theory. I don't necessarily need to have string theory to think about them. But a lot of them
2173360	2179680	nowadays, they are motivated again for one for another. In themselves, actually very natural.
2180560	2184720	One of the questions, I think to me, one of the most fundamental questions there is why
2185440	2191280	why three dimension and you mentioned Robert Brunnenberger earlier, he's one that he's an
2191280	2196160	incredible physicist, but he's one of the physicists that has come up with the most
2197120	2204080	ideas on why it is that we're experiencing three dimensions. Even in string theory,
2205120	2212560	we understand there are extra dimensions, but precisely what is the mechanism that led to us
2212560	2219200	living in a universe that experiences three dimensions is something quite challenging. And
2219200	2224560	it's not natural at all in string theory. It's very hard to make that work. There's no natural
2224560	2234800	process. He and collaborators of him, also, and Davis and with Dura have been people have been
2234800	2244080	exploring the idea of how dynamically you can have sort of a selection mechanism that either picks
2244080	2249920	out membranes in extra dimensions with which are three plus one dimensional. There's almost an
2249920	2255840	evolution selection mechanism where those are the ones we end up living in or some other types
2255840	2262000	of mechanisms in why the other dimension would be confined, compactified to be very small,
2262240	2269760	we only experience the ones we do. But even in both case scenarios assumes the existence of other
2269760	2277200	dimensions and that could have consequences on us. To see the consequences of that, typically,
2277840	2282880	you expect you have to go to very high energy scale to be able to probe those extra dimensions,
2282880	2288000	and that corresponds to going, again, back to the very early universe, again, to the type of
2288000	2292640	research that you're doing. And it is possible, and I would hope very much so, that it could be
2292640	2298800	imprints on the very early universe of those extra dimensions. And that could be imprints on the power
2298800	2304720	spectrum of the CMB and B mode polarization, possibly. That's for you to tell me, actually,
2305280	2310400	they can be in some other models of extra dimensions, they can be some effect, actually,
2310960	2316400	not at very high energy, but at very low energy, that things will look very similar to,
2316960	2320800	and will look four dimensional, three plus one, necessarily four dimensional, I mean,
2320800	2326880	three of space and one of time dimension for everyday life. But as you go to larger and
2326880	2333520	larger distances on the cosmological distances, then you're able to start probing the extra dimension.
2333520	2340160	And that's why the universe, the evolution of the universe nowadays seems kind of counterintuitive,
2341040	2346640	and that's because we're starting possibly to probe the extra dimension, the extra dimension of space.
2346640	2353200	So it's sort of a relic or a shadow of the higher dimensions that we perceive in the pre-dimension?
2353200	2358000	Yeah, there's a lot of models out there where our cosmological evolution,
2358960	2365600	what we live as a universe is really, as you say, reminiscent of our shadow, a consequence of our
2365600	2372240	motion through time, yes, but really through the extra dimensional space. We are traveling through
2372240	2377520	this extra dimensional space, and that has an effect on our universe as a whole, with just a
2377520	2382960	consequence of that. A question I have for you, perhaps to elucidate, and I've asked it to many
2382960	2388720	scientists, but I never really get an answer that I can try. And I've asked even Roger Penrose,
2388720	2392720	in his multiple occasions of being on the podcast. And then you hope I have an answer.
2395760	2400640	I hear what he says, but I don't know if I understand what he says, although that might be
2400640	2406880	due to my failure to have consciousness, according to him. But my question for you is, first, do we
2406880	2412000	need a quantum theory of gravity? I mean, the only two scenarios where quantum gravity seems to
2412000	2419440	pertain in any kind of important, impactful, relevant role is not in our daily lives, but are
2419440	2426160	at the singularities of black holes, and perhaps the origin of time, if indeed time had an origin,
2426160	2430960	and many people don't believe that it did, or it was a classical bounce, or different cosmological
2430960	2436160	models, past guests, Paul Steinhart, Anna Aegis, Neil Turrock, many others, don't believe in the
2436160	2441760	singular quantum gravity necessity. So why do we need a theory of quantum gravity? If these
2442320	2448640	only two realms that we know about are shielded by event horizons, what's the point? We'll never
2448640	2454880	be able to witness this anyway. So actually, I am working on some understanding how to make that
2454880	2463680	connection. So you probably want concretely to understand how to compute those things in situation
2463680	2470080	that we will likely never experience ourselves. That is true. But at the same time, we want to
2470160	2474960	understand why we live in the world we are living in. I think we all want to ask ourselves those
2474960	2480800	questions. It's all part of the origin. Why are we here? Why is life here? Why are universes here?
2480800	2489200	But even more fundamentally, why is representation of nature, representation of spacetime here,
2489200	2496560	and that the answer is, I think, seated in a theory, a more fundamental theory, a more fundamental
2496560	2504320	theory of something that unifies, again, not only the fundamental forces of nature, as we know them
2504320	2511280	with the weak and strong forces and electromagneticism, but also gravity and this unification
2511280	2517200	could have some consequences. What is our deep down origin in terms of what is the origin of
2517200	2526400	spacetime itself? I think we talked about that at the beginning already. Why are we pursuing
2526480	2532480	some such fundamental questions that we'll never be able to really experience the consequences of
2532480	2540720	that? History has told us that often we think that would be the case. We saw Einstein thought
2540720	2547840	that gravitational waves will never have any consequences to our life. No, no, no connections
2547840	2554560	to reality. We do use them now to communicate in some sense. Maybe communicate is a big word
2554560	2560800	because that incinerates a two-way communication, which is not the case so far, but we do communicate
2560800	2567520	with them with the universe. We use them as a new window, as a new way to see our universe,
2567520	2573200	see gravitational waves. That's an example where 100 years ago we thought there's never any use to
2573200	2581440	it, and yet we're here. They are real. We have detected them. The fact that I can't tell you
2581440	2589120	right now whether we'll ever be able to experience a situation where quantum gravity is needed to
2589840	2596240	predict what happens precisely doesn't mean that there wouldn't be one, but who is to answer that
2596240	2602400	if we don't know what it is, we'll never be able to even answer that. I think we need to explore
2602400	2608000	beyond what we know to be able to see how much more there is out there and make sense of all
2608000	2613280	of those things. Let me go back to that point because we do say, for instance, I'm not a strength
2613280	2618320	theorist, so I can say that. I'm not a strength theorist. Nobody's perfect, Claudia. Nobody's
2618320	2626480	perfect. I'm not a strength theorist. I'm quite agnostic on whatever is going on at very high
2626480	2631600	energy, and some of my colleagues would not talk to me anymore for saying that. By the way, I have
2631600	2636880	to interrupt you and pardon my interruption, but part of the mission of this podcast is to educate
2636960	2642080	young scientists and how to be a good scientist. I just want to highlight what Claudia just said,
2642720	2648320	that it's her job, and my job as an experimentalist, her job as a theorist, to be agnostic. I was
2648320	2653520	asked by the New York Times recently, what do I hope for? What do I really want to find with the
2653520	2659920	Simon's Observatory? I said, our job is not to prove things. My job is to prove people like you
2659920	2665440	wrong, and your job is to keep refining what you know about the universe so that eventually I can't
2665440	2670560	prove you wrong, but that won't prove you right. What Claudia just did is incredibly important,
2670560	2676480	right? That's right. It's never about proving someone right or wrong in some sense. It's more
2676480	2683120	about deepening our understanding of nature. That's where we're going. This is why the book
2683120	2688640	is called The Beauty of Falling, because I will fall every day. I will come up with things which
2688640	2693040	are wrong every day. I will fall, and that is important. This is the way we make progress.
2694000	2699520	Right. At the end, you say, in fact, past these pictures that that is part of the beauty, is that
2699520	2706000	not just that you fall, and that that can be awesome, but part of the journey is
2707200	2713600	how you get back up, and how you respond to these challenges. I think, again, just for my young
2713600	2718560	students and postdocs and young faculty and old faculty who might need to learn this lesson,
2719200	2724320	the concept of quantum gravity is a beautiful one, because we have this innate need to
2724320	2729760	quantize everything we see. It's done so well, but the question I have even goes, you talk about
2729760	2736000	pie in the sky, and it reminded me of this past guest, Elon Musk, who I did talk to on the podcast
2736000	2743360	tangentially. You can find it on the videos and audio, but he once said the plank length sets
2743360	2747920	this fundamental limit beyond which we don't even need to know the digits of pie. In other words,
2747920	2755200	there's some minimum radius circle, which would be the plank length. I responded to him, he didn't
2755200	2761040	write back, but that's sort of nonsensical. Nothing really happens at the plank length. Am
2761040	2767280	I wrong about that? It is a correspondence, a numerological coincidence, but nothing more,
2767280	2772640	or am I wrong? What we know is that there comes a point, it's not about a distance. It never was
2772640	2779920	about a distance in itself. It's about when the curvature, some measurable effect of the
2779920	2786080	curvature becomes big enough, and that is not so much about what distance you can measure, but
2786720	2792240	for instance, going within regions of space-time where you end up having, for instance, close to a
2792240	2796640	black hole or at the big bang, as you were mentioning, there will seem to suggest that the
2796640	2803840	curvature there becomes very large. So that a physical region where these things can happen,
2803840	2812400	but understanding how we transition from the semi-classical model of gravity through general
2812400	2820560	relativity, which is embedded in an effective quantum field theory, how we transition between
2820560	2828320	that and something which takes over when this effective quantum field theory breaks down,
2828320	2834080	I think it is important to make communication between the two, and a lot of the work I do at
2834080	2839920	the moment, which is a lot of massive gravity, is to understand what are the key ingredients
2840800	2848160	that we have to keep beyond our understanding of reality, beyond general activity. You don't
2848160	2852640	even think of those concepts anymore. You don't think of space and time anymore,
2852640	2858960	but you think of probabilities, and you think of the notion of causality is extremely important,
2858960	2868720	and it's embedded not so much into return to the future kind of cartoon line, but it's encoded
2868720	2875360	in deep statements in how we can think of probabilities, and how we can think of also
2875360	2881280	the notion of probabilities in a quantum sense, whether they respect some notion of
2881280	2887920	unitarity, where if you sum up the probabilities of a given outcome, whether they will sum up to one,
2887920	2894400	or whether they sum up to something imaginary or negative, which would make no sense.
2894400	2901520	And so these are very, very basic criteria that are satisfied by string theory, for instance,
2901520	2906800	and you like to ask yourself, without necessarily even relying on string theory, are those
2907680	2915440	concepts even correct? And is it okay for me to rely on them when all other notions of reality
2915440	2925920	have fallen apart? Is it okay for me to rely on those specific, just hang on onto them to see how
2926000	2932640	this very basic principle cascades that way down to something concrete at low energy,
2932640	2939200	and something which is consistent with what we observe? And we can actually make connections,
2939200	2944400	we can actually come, I can come up, I can give you a model today that seems completely
2945040	2951440	meaningful, I can come up with a model that can describe most of, or if not,
2951440	2956880	everything that I'd observed today. And then I know that if I were to go back up and make a
2956880	2964240	connection with how it will be realized at very, much more fundamentally, it will have to break
2964240	2968560	some of those assumptions. It will have to break some of this assumption of unitarity,
2968560	2973840	or causality, or some of the way I think about these much more basic amplitudes. And so I think
2973840	2980240	it is important in some sense to see what is it we're relying on at the end of the day? What are
2980240	2990000	we aiming for? And we know that the way we're going to end up describing things, nature, once we
2990000	2995360	no longer can rely on even the notion of space and time to describe them is going to be very
2995360	3000800	challenging. We're going to need to invent new tools, new way to thinking to represent them.
3000800	3005600	And I don't even know precisely what is the right question for me to ask to even be able to
3006240	3013920	express that. But I want to hang on on very basic principles. And I think it is a meaningful
3013920	3020240	question for me to ask myself, are those okay to rely on? Because if they're not, then I have to
3020240	3025680	give up even more than that. Yeah. And I guess the question I keep coming back to is what would
3026240	3036320	constitute a detection of a quantum nature of gravity? And how could we do it? In the case,
3036320	3040080	we have to be open to the prospect that the Simons Observatory and every other observatory
3040080	3044800	may fail to detect gravitational waves and primordial nature. But that doesn't mean we
3044800	3049040	couldn't rule out quantum gravity. And when I go back in another way, in addition to Robert
3049040	3054080	Brandenberger, in addition to being pilots, in addition to, I'm not interested in scuba diving,
3054080	3059280	but we were both at Case Western, where the very first Michelson interferometer was done.
3059280	3063200	And I understand from your book that, you know, Michelson got into a little bit of a
3063200	3069200	palaver, as you Brits might say, you're not British. But the point being, they used a
3069200	3073520	Michelson interferometer, and now we have these LIGO machines. And my friend Eric Weinstein,
3073520	3077280	you know, came up with a beautiful thought experiment that I want to run by you as we
3077280	3081520	wrap up. Imagine the double slit experiment. The double slit experiment is the most quantum of
3081760	3087760	quantum mechanical experiments in terms of manifesting truly irreproducible quantum behavior.
3087760	3091200	Eric asked the question to me, and I couldn't answer it, so I'll ask it to you. Hopefully,
3091200	3095360	you can answer it. But if you had a double slit experiment, you know, the electron goes through,
3095360	3099280	you know, these, you know, goes through both slits, the wave function goes through both
3099280	3105200	slits in some sense. But, but in a classical sense, could you not use the gravitational effects
3105200	3110480	of the electron, just as a thought experiment? And could you not probe the use the gravitational
3110480	3115600	waves produced by this electron as it flies through, you know, presumably one of the two slits,
3115600	3121120	at least in Einstein's conception. So could you use these interferometers, these Michelson
3121120	3126640	interferometers of LIGO, just as a thought experiment, to reveal which segment of the,
3126640	3131360	or which slit the electron went through, and therefore, you know, kind of simultaneously
3131360	3134400	be able to localize its position and momentum in a sense.
3134400	3137120	But from the gravitational waves produced by the electron itself?
3137680	3143520	Yeah, you use the gravitational waves to then measure the, the, which slit the electron went
3143520	3151680	through. Yeah. So you need to look at what is the magnitude of a gravitational wave the
3151680	3155760	the electron would produce. I'm not saying you could do it. Yeah, that was my thought too.
3155760	3162240	And that is very weak. That is going to be very, very weak in, in, in amplitude. And the issue
3162240	3168560	with that is that if you have a very weak gravitational wave that goes through, then in,
3169200	3175280	in the case of the interferometers here on earth, then they will move the position of the,
3175280	3182240	the mirrors, which will be below Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Now I am a theorist,
3182240	3187200	so I have no problem saying and applying for funding to say, let's build an
3187200	3192960	interferometer, which is of the size of the universe. Let's do that. But even if you get the
3192960	3202640	funding, you know, you write the proposal then. So let's do that. I'll talk to Greg. You help me
3202640	3214560	sweet talk Greg. Okay. I'm going to be blacklisted. The issue is if you think, if you think about
3214560	3222320	the gravitational wave produced by an electron in that process, it's, it's way too weak to being able
3222320	3229040	to, to detect its effect. So but there are some experiments out there where I think one, one,
3229600	3235680	one of the experiments you should try to think about is having electrons absorbing a gravitational
3235680	3241440	wave and a quantum of gravitational waves. So absorb a graviton. That's really what you
3241440	3247280	want to do to test the quantum nature of gravity in a way which would be very similar to that of
3247280	3254960	light. We know that electrons can absorb or emit unique quanta, discrete quanta of light
3254960	3261280	or photons. And as they do that as a change in energy level around the atoms. So you want to do
3261280	3267040	the same thing with gravitons. And in principle, that would happen. The probability would be very,
3267040	3271120	very small. But in principle, you can imagine that would happen. The issue is always
3272240	3277840	the reality of the world in which we live in. That's, it's just so sad because it's not the
3277840	3283040	process that is quite so, I mean, it is challenging in itself. It's not, it's not just that. It's the
3283040	3288720	fact that there's a lot of noise out there. There's a lot of other things that would that lead to
3288720	3294960	electrons changing energy levels, for instance. And so if you want to shield your whole experiment
3294960	3300560	from light and the trainers and all sorts of other cosmic rays that would have the same effect on
3300560	3307200	your electrons, you're in trouble, but that it's the reality of life in which we, which we live in.
3307200	3314720	If we were living in a much simpler universe where there was no, nothing other than electrons and,
3315920	3322000	and, and gravitons and there was no cosmic rays and even light, or then it may be, it may have
3322000	3329200	been easier to abstract yourself from any other noise and prove maybe the quantum nature of gravity.
3329200	3334000	Well, I think that would be a wonderful place to wrap up. There's so many interesting things we could
3334000	3340080	explore in this wonderful new book. We'll have to do it perhaps in person someday. The beauty of
3340080	3346480	Falling is a beautiful book, A Life in Pursuit of Gravity, and it's endorsed by some of the
3346560	3354160	past guests on the podcast, including Sarah Seeger and Sean Carroll, both, both of them give it their
3354160	3361360	most high encomium, as do I. Claudia de Rome, I hope you have a great deal of success with this
3361360	3366320	wonderful book. And I think your students are lucky to have you and your colleagues are lucky to have
3366320	3372400	you. And it's wonderful to have an iconoclastic thinker that, that does can, can, can, can operate
3372400	3376560	as you do in the mainstream. You can talk to string theorists. You can talk to
3377520	3384400	people that study loop quantum gravity or causal set theory. And you're not afraid to, to kind of
3384400	3389920	push back respectfully as, as I think is so refreshing. So this, this book is a wonderful
3389920	3394720	edition. It's incredibly readable. I listened to it. Princeton University sent me the audio copy as
3394720	3400880	well, which is not read by you, but, but is a delightful voice, whoever the, the narrator is. So
3400880	3405200	I cannot recommend this highly enough. Thank you. Thank you, Brian. It was so much fun to talk to you.
3405200	3409600	Thanks. Thanks. Hey there. I know if you watched all the way to the end, you're going to love this
3409600	3415200	interview with Lawrence Krauss, one of the progenitors of the notion of dark energy. And click
