0	12800	Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.
12800	20720	A legendary figure in my life, in physics, in cosmology, in philosophy, in mathematics,
20720	25160	and that is Professor Lee Smolin joining us from the Perimeter Institute, our neighbor
25160	26160	to the north.
26160	28080	Lee Smolin, how are you today, my friend?
28400	33520	I'm very well, thank you, and thank you very much for the kind words and the invitation.
34160	39920	Lee, you've made fundamental contributions in many different aspects of cosmology, of physics,
39920	46800	philosophy, but what I first wanted to turn to is the influence that you had on me as a
46800	54160	younger physicist, as a beginning professor back in 2006, when you're really a pockle book called
54240	56240	The Trouble with Physics came out.
56240	61520	This book influenced me and a whole generation of physicists, both theoreticians and experimentalists
61520	68480	like myself, and there are very few books that in physics that are relevant 14, 15, 16,
68480	72400	four years, three years, two years after they're written, let alone 15 years after.
72400	77200	And in this book, which I reread, re-listened to recently in preparation for this interview,
78000	82800	I noted that you were talking about the stagnation in physics in the previous 25 years.
82800	87360	So if I add, I'm not as good at math as you are, but if I add 25 to 15, I get 40.
88480	89360	Wow, I just do.
91360	96240	Do you still stand by that, or do you still observe that same stagnation, to some extent,
96240	100400	in physics, at least in theoretical physics? Obviously, experimental physics is completely
100400	101040	different.
101040	105840	There are certainly areas which are doing very well. There are areas of quantum materials where
105840	110080	the theory is really interesting, and I love thinking about it.
110960	119840	I think it's still true that we have not made a fundamental discovery experimentally,
119840	123520	that we explained theoretically, or theoretically posited something
124160	126320	that was discovered experimentally.
127360	133120	And we still don't know the why questions about the standing model.
133120	139520	Why though? There are now something like 30 parameters, including now that the neutrino
139520	144000	has mass, including the masses and the mixing angles of the neutrino.
144640	150800	And we have no explanation for what the values of those dimensions are,
151920	159200	nor for the strength of the gravitational constant, nor for the dark energy or the cosmological
159280	169760	constant. And I went into physics to understand why the universe was the way it is.
170400	178240	And there's lots about that we can get into. The universe is not just some random set of
178240	186240	numbers out there. The universe is enormously structured and organized and self-organized,
186320	193120	and that seems to be at least partly due to those constants being in certain narrow windows,
194000	199040	where there are lots of chemical and nuclear reactions that can take place.
200000	210640	So I think I stand by that. We have ideas about quantum gravity, and we have more ideas than
210640	216800	we did 15 years ago. None of them have some of them make experimental predictions,
216800	224880	but none of those predictions have enough to help. There's always the default, as you would know,
224880	230800	we've looked for the rent symmetry breaking at the Planck scale and around the Planck scale,
230800	237360	using astrophysical experiments. And the evidence is that it's not there. And there's a number of
237920	246080	anomalies that we've looked for, and they're not there. So it's a very frustrating period.
246080	252320	When we look at alternatives to string theory, which has become and still remains a dominant
252320	259040	paradigm, I've had conversations with Carla Revelli, who's become a dear friend. And actually,
259040	263520	we are collaborating together. And he is another person, I thank you for putting me
263520	267680	in touch with many years ago. And we are collaborating on the first ever audio book
267680	275840	version of Galileo Galilei's dialogue on two chief world systems. Yeah, it's going to be amazing
275840	281600	with another Italian physicist, along with Jim Gates reading a foreword from Galileo,
281600	285920	Fabiola Gianate, and others. Stay tuned for more information about that. You can get more if you
285920	293040	subscribe to my newsletter at bryankeating.com. But I want to turn our attention to some surprising
293040	298080	developments that I had talking with a string theory proponent. And that was Michio Kaku,
298080	303920	who came on my podcast recently in promotion of his new book, The God Equation, which he claims,
303920	308800	you know, string theory is responsible for a series of successes, not stagnations, even even
308800	317040	such things like the G minus two anomaly and the LHC beauty experiment anomaly, that these
317040	323360	things are hints, tantalizing hints of the efficacy of string theory. And I pushed back, Lee, you
323360	328080	know, I'm only a simple experimentalist, I said, but I said, to my knowledge, and you, Lee, can
328080	333680	correct me if I'm wrong. Nobody looked at string theory and said, hmm, let's predict this correction
333680	340160	to the G minus two from string theory. And he pushed back on me and said, well, nobody did that
340160	345520	from loop quantum gravity, because loop quantum gravity is so simplistic, it doesn't even have
345520	352640	fermions in it. And I said, because I'm just a fool, I don't, I didn't know how to answer him,
352640	356960	you know, and then we say in Judaism know how to answer a heretic. So I didn't know how to
356960	361360	answer him. How would you have answered him, Michio Kaku, when he says loop quantum gravity,
361360	366640	which you are one of its foremost exponents, along with Abbas, Abe Ashdekar, and Carlo and
366640	370480	others. But Lee, how should I have answered him? I'm sorry, I let you down, but how should I have
370480	377840	answered him? No, the way to end there, first of all, loop quantum gravity is a method. It's not,
377840	388080	in my understanding, a theory. It's a method of studying systems whose forces are described by
388080	393200	gauge fields. And we can talk about what that means, like the standard model of general relativity.
394000	401280	And that method applied to general relativity yields some very interesting descriptions of what
401840	408240	the geometry of the world might be on very small scales. That is 10 to the minus 30 something of
408240	416000	a centimeter. That method can be applied to theories with fermions. And there are,
416080	423840	then, fermions behave like fermions. So there's no problem including fermions. There's no problem
423840	431040	coupling to gauge fields and coupling to the scalar and the fermions of the standard model.
432000	440320	There is a very interesting issue about chirality, which I know is an issue in cosmology and
440320	447680	astronomy that we've worked on a lot and thought about. So we have some issues about chirality,
448320	460160	which I'm happy to admit. My feeling, and I hope I can say this without sounding egotistical or
460160	471040	something. The people you mentioned, Abai and Carlo and I, are thought of often as the founders
471040	479280	of the quantum gravity, the inventors. But let's break, if it's interesting, let's break that down.
480160	490640	Abai brought into being an approach to general relativity based on seeing the
491760	496320	geometry of space and time like a gauge theory. And I can tell you what that means.
497920	508560	It means we care more about measuring how things like fingers or spins move around when you move
508560	521200	around space. That's called the connection. The connection tells things. And my first role,
521200	528080	I guess I had many, but my first role was that there was a whole bunch of beautiful ideas and
528080	536960	technology, theoretical technology, that had been developed about QCD, mainly by a Russian school,
536960	546240	Sasha Pavlikov, Gribov, McDowell. And there were also some Americans, principally, Ken Wilson.
546960	554560	And they had a beautiful picture in which, well, do you know, or do your listeners know, that if you
554560	562480	pass a magnetic field through a superconductor, it becomes discreet. There's a unit of magnetic
562480	572400	flux that that flux line will take on in this organization. And their hypothesis going,
572400	578960	well, it was also due to Holger Nielsen and a number of other people, was that in QCD, which is
578960	587920	sort of like a complicated version of electromagnetism with three photons, the electric field flux
587920	595120	would be quantized and discreet. And there was a picture of strings made out of that flux
595680	603680	holding forks together. And I basically stole that. I mean, it's legitimate. That's what we're
603680	611200	doing science. All that picture and technology and said, what if instead of QCD, I plug in the
611200	621280	bias theory about seeing gravity and connection here and use all those beautiful ideas and tools
621280	628640	that I probably call them Ken Wilson. And that was, that was, I got lucky, in some sense, because
629760	634720	where and when I went to graduate school, it was immersed in that those ideas and those
634720	642640	technologies. And I was the first to try to apply them to quantum gravity. And I had a picture in
642640	652880	my head of loops and areas being quantized and so forth. And that picture with a lot of input
652880	660400	from other people became quantum gravity. And particularly, Carlos brought a very important
660400	670240	picture of how to think of the quantum mechanics of all that. But now, but now it's, that was the
670240	678880	middle 80s, I want to count, that's a long time ago. I love quantum gravity. It's been a family.
679520	688000	It's been an adventure of friends. But it has problems too. And I'm happy to talk about them.
688000	695840	I'm not, I would not think of myself as a proponent in the sense of somebody who ignores
695840	703920	the issues. I think there are issues. And when I set up a research center, perimeter,
704880	710000	I used a philosophy, which is part of the book you want to talk about the trouble with physics,
710720	717760	which I gained from the philosopher Paul Farahman, which was to get good people from
717760	724480	diverse points of view, and don't privilege one point of view just because I have a legacy
725360	731440	with that theory, get good people who do you think of quantum gravity from several points of view,
732480	738240	and have it and have the conflict, which is what the trouble with physics was about.
738960	744960	Right. So there are people in the loop on gravity world who think that I abandoned them,
744960	750800	and there are people in the rest of the world who think that I'm a loop on gravity guy. And I'm neither.
754560	760960	I really love the way you say that. And, you know, when I think about things, I often wonder,
760960	767280	you know, are we, are we putting the gut before the toe or the toe before the gut? And by that,
767360	773760	I mean, you know, we don't have a good grand unified theory yet, in my opinion, or my understanding.
773760	777760	And yet people want to look for a theory of everything. First of all, I think a theory of
777760	782320	everything. And I think Michio does a disservice, to be honest, by saying that this one inch long
782320	787040	God equation will describe everything. It'll give you soup and nuts, and it'll give you aliens.
787040	791840	It'll give you avatars traveling at the speed of light cruising around the galaxy. It will give
791840	796640	be, you know, and it will win you a Nobel Prize that Einstein couldn't win. And you know how I
796640	801920	feel about the Nobel Prize is hagiographic, you know, kind of idol worship, onanistic idol worship.
802720	809120	Nevertheless, it's important to consider what is the importance of a theory of everything.
809120	814720	And I want to ask you, are we putting the toe before the gut? Should we, in your opinion,
814720	818800	spend more time thinking about how do we unify the theories that, you know, we have
818800	822640	very strong evidence to believe that are unified? I personally don't believe
822640	828240	that we should demand that gravity be unified with quantum mechanics. I hope we can get into that.
828240	832000	But what do you think? Should we focus first on guts before we get to toes?
832960	839440	Well, long before that, let's open up, can we open up to the whole universe?
840320	848800	Yeah. It seems to me there are two kinds of phenomena. They're loosely speaking, they're
848800	856960	phenomena. I mean, we believe you and I and most of our colleagues believe some version of the
857680	862160	laws are pretty stable and they're fundamental laws and we're trying to find out what they are
862160	867760	and they're pretty stable. I actually probably disagree with you or at least with most of our
867760	873360	colleagues. I think those laws are changeable and I think they do change and I think they have
873360	879520	change and I think that because that's the only way we're going to explain the question of why they
879520	887920	have the form that they have. So I'm on the lookout for principles by which the laws can change.
888480	895040	That is, I'm no longer hopeful that there's going to be some magic formula that's going to tell us
895040	900560	what the values of all those planets are. I think it evolved that way because there are consequences
901360	909040	for the natural world, for the physical world, which we can come to. Thinking about it that way,
909040	914800	you have to invoke functional explanation. A functional explanation is an explanation of
914800	921840	something where you use some consequence of what it does in the world. So there are
922800	931520	20 to the thousand different kinds of proteins, roughly. That's 20 different amino acids in
931520	939760	a thousand places. It's a typical protein. That's a whole lot more than the kinds of proteins that
939760	946240	exist on the biosphere that are coded for in the DNA or the RNA of the various creatures,
946880	955440	which are like a million. So any protein that exists is lucky because most of the other
955440	962640	alternate proteins don't exist. And why did it get lucky? It got lucky because, for example,
962640	970640	my code for hemoglobin, which is a fundamental way to move oxygen around within a creature,
971600	979840	and which there's a lot of, along with various variants and so forth. So if you ask why does
979840	987920	hemoglobin exist, sure, you've got to be able to analyze and see the laws of electromagnetism and
987920	996880	so forth, acting inside that crazy, wound-up, folded-up thing. But there's also functional
996880	1006400	explanations, and both of them have got to work. And I think that's going to apply to everything.
1007120	1015600	And I also don't take the mathematics as dogma, as religion, if I can use that. I was at one time,
1015600	1021440	but I am no longer looking for that mathematical object, which has all the truth of that nature,
1022320	1032240	to somehow transcend our existence and give our life meaning. I think we give life meaning through
1032240	1040320	friendship and families and what we believe in and who we love. And the universe kind of thus
1041520	1050480	is doing the same thing. So I'm not, many of our colleagues are looking for something transcendent
1050480	1055360	when they want to know what the laws are, what the standard model, what the two unified theories are.
1056080	1063440	I would love to see some explanation of the structure of the standard model. I've been attending,
1065120	1070400	we have weird conferences, of course, as you know, some conferences are every week or somewhere every
1070400	1076640	month. So there's a conference about an idea that used to get you kicked out of the archive,
1076720	1082240	but it turns out to be solid enough that there are a lot of interesting people doing it,
1082240	1086960	which is that the standard model has something to do with the number system of actonians.
1087840	1093760	And that would be cool. But I'd certainly like some explanation. Where does the SU-3,
1093760	1098640	of course, SU-2 come from? Where does the three generations come from? We all want
1099600	1106320	some kind of answer to that. And my, I'm willing, I'm in fact, eager to have a functional kind of
1106320	1118400	example. For example, this might come up later. If you want the universe to reproduce itself
1118400	1125040	through black holes, which is an idea that I had, you want the upper mass limit of neutron stars
1125760	1129120	to be as low as possible so that as many supernovas
1129840	1136560	lead to black holes as opposed to neutron stars. And from that, you can get a prediction that the
1137440	1145040	heaviest stable neutron star can't be more than two solar masses. And there's, and the reason
1145040	1149760	is some complicated thing about the strange core, if I won't bore you with, unless you really, really
1149760	1156240	want. But the thing is that recently, there's better and better evidence that there are some
1156240	1165360	neutron stars up in 20, I'm sorry, two solar masses, 2.2, and so forth. And if those hold up,
1166320	1177280	then my theory or my hypothesis is falsified. And I will proudly say so.
1178240	1183360	Yeah, you talk about that a lot in the book. You talk about, you know, different gamma-ray
1183360	1190400	burst signatures that could be falsified as of 2006. You have other tests that could be,
1190400	1196720	you describe them as very exciting variation in the fine structure constant. You point out
1196720	1202160	as very exciting. And I've, I know that you have extreme, you know, integrity in all ways,
1202160	1205360	not only personally, but because you, you know, because I know you personally,
1205360	1209600	but also because publicly, you've talked about how this has gone away, that there's no,
1209600	1214640	you've stated that you've kind of abandoned that, that hope. And you admit that it was a hope back
1214640	1221920	in the early part of the, of the, you know, of the 2000s, that these fine structure constant could
1221920	1227440	be revelatory of new physics, but now it's ruled out. And you accept that and you move on.
1227440	1232320	I wonder, you know, when I first started hearing about you from my, from my best friend, Stefan,
1233280	1237760	you know, I always thought that, you know, when I first learned about you, it was like
1237760	1244560	what Stephen Hawking reputedly said about Jacob Zeldovich. When he met him, he thought that Zeldovich
1244560	1250960	was like Burbaki, like a collective, a set of people. And I thought that about Smolin. I thought
1250960	1256720	Smolin was like Satoshi Nakamura or whoever that guy is who supposedly or collective came up with
1256800	1262880	Bitcoin or blockchain. I want to ask you, you put out three or four papers recently. And some of
1262880	1268000	them with Stefan, some of them solo papers, this voluminous effort, I think you're writing a paper
1268000	1271920	right now. I'd like to see your hands, Lee, could you put your hands up so I know that you're not
1271920	1276960	typing out a paper as we're having this lovely interview. But I want to ask you, what would
1276960	1282640	a theory of everything look like? Would it be the semi classical Wheeler DeWitt equation that would
1282720	1288960	be fundamental? Would it be the Schrodinger equation? If gravity is fundamental, some say the
1288960	1294560	Schrodinger equation. If gravity is emergent, some say it's the latter. Your recent paper is so
1294560	1299680	fascinating. You have one called the quantum mechanics of the present written with Clea Verde.
1302800	1308080	And the other one, the symbiotic emergence of space and the quantum. That one is a solo paper.
1308080	1313920	Let's talk about that firstly, please. What does it mean for space to become emergent? What does
1313920	1323280	that even mean? What it means is that the organization of space, of things moving in space,
1324160	1332080	is not fundamental. It's real, for sure. Of course, we see it. But it's not fundamental. And what I
1332080	1340960	mean is that I'm looking, like many of our colleagues, for a formulation of
1342880	1351360	theory that is a story about the world and how it's made, that will explain the mysteries of
1351360	1357440	quantum mechanics. So I'm a little ambitious, for better or worse, to explain the mysteries of
1357440	1365520	quantum mechanics and resolve those issues like the measurement problem. I want that same structure
1366160	1373440	to explain general relativity. So to be the quantum theory of gravity, although the fundamental
1373440	1382720	theory that it's coming from is neither quantum mechanics nor gravity. And after a lot of thinking
1382720	1387360	and talking, here I've been influenced by a number of people. And it's always important.
1388240	1394080	I mean, we never do these things alone. So Fortuni Marco Pulo was the first person who said to me,
1394960	1405040	space does not exist so time can. Space is not in the fundamental list of things that are there
1405040	1410480	all the way down. But time is. For example, space time is in some fundamental way a different thing
1410480	1419520	than matter. And if space time is an emergent concept, then it's not really clear what you
1419520	1424480	would mean by unification. Surely it would not be the unification of matter with gravity.
1425360	1430720	It might be a way to get gravity out of matter that would be a different sort of,
1430720	1434320	I guess you could think of it as a unification scenario, but it's a bit different than what
1434320	1440880	people are considering now. I see. And Roberto Manguibara Hunger, who is a Brazilian philosopher,
1441840	1449760	was interested in the same kind of things. And we wrote it was hard, but we wrote a very interesting
1449760	1458000	book together. That book is called The Singular Universe. And the basic idea of that theory,
1458000	1466080	that theory is now called the causal theory of views. And the basic idea of that theory comes from
1467680	1473280	Leibniz, the philosopher. And it's that, and it's going to sound a little weird, it's that
1474000	1481600	the universe is composed of partial views of itself. So what I mean is that at every event,
1481600	1488480	and this is a theory of events and the causes between events. There might be two events here,
1488480	1493280	which in some sense are the cause of a third event, which is a cause of the fourth event.
1494000	1503600	And each event has a past, has the things that led up to causing it. And I call that the view,
1503600	1513520	that's far from Leibniz. And I take the set of all the views from all the events in the universe
1514320	1524240	to be what the universe is. And then I apply laws to those. And the main idea
1526240	1531280	there came from work in common with Julian Barber a long time ago,
1532000	1538400	which is to measure the complexity of some complex system, whether it's a city or an economy,
1539280	1546480	or a piece of quantum space and time, by making the views from different events or different
1546480	1554160	situations, may that be as diverse as possible. And you can write down a numerical measure of that.
1554160	1563360	And that we take as the quantity that gets extremized to give you the equations of motion.
1564960	1569840	Physics is often organized in such a way that physics and quantity that gets
1570480	1579360	extremized and minimized. That's called the action. And so the theory has an action which is related
1580160	1588000	to what we call between the variety. Now, the one last thing I have to say about how this goes
1588000	1594160	together is that if you don't have space, you don't have distances between things,
1594880	1600000	you don't have functions, you don't have fields, you don't have derivatives. So how are you going
1600000	1607520	to write down dynamics? All the things that we'll go into are writing down some law of a field or
1607600	1614560	a particle, involve distances or derivatives or fields. And so we don't have any of that,
1614560	1620800	but what we can do is compare the views. We can ask, you look around where you are,
1620800	1628240	I look around where I am, and that there's a mathematical language to record that view,
1628240	1636160	and then they can be compared. And so the whole dynamics that I developed is based on those
1636160	1645120	comparisons. So that's the basic idea. Then what happens in that paper with, unfortunately,
1645120	1652080	too many technicalities and so forth, is I derive quantum mechanics from those ideas.
1653360	1656880	Interesting. Now, you mentioned Julian Barbour, he's an upcoming guest
1657440	1663840	on the Into the Impossible podcast, and I asked him to ask a question of you,
1664480	1672720	and then he responded, and then I will ask you to ask him a question that I will convey through
1672720	1677920	me to him. So his question to you, if you're willing to play this game of time traveling
1677920	1684800	questions, this is a very inefficient way to use the internet, Lee. I hope you appreciate how
1684800	1690800	time inefficient this is to talk about time in this way. But anyway, Lee, Julian asks you with
1690880	1698160	warm regards he sends to you. If time is fundamentally, what is it like? What are its attributes?
1700880	1707840	Very good. So what we say, and this is in the work we did with Marina Cortes,
1708480	1716000	developing a prior structure to the theory that was based on slamming, what we say is that
1716960	1722880	the business of time, so I'm not going to define, I'm going to duck it, I'm going to say
1723600	1731920	that the business or the work of time is to continually make new events which make up,
1731920	1739440	so what I want to say, what time is like, is what we experience. That is, we experience the
1739440	1746560	momentary present and the passage of those moments when new things happen and new things happen.
1747360	1754320	And that's the business or the mechanism of time to keep choosing what new things get made
1754880	1758720	and what they, and therefore that chooses what their costs look like.
1759600	1766560	I talked to Frank Wilczak about time and his basic thesis is that time and entropy are
1766560	1775120	somehow fundamentally linked. Carlo feels this way as well that the Clausius equation of delta S
1775120	1782480	is greater than or equal to zero, entropy is, and that things change and that Frank then supplements
1782480	1789920	that equation with the fact that a clock measures something that is changing and time is what we
1789920	1795760	call the change in something. So it's sort of a tautology, but it's almost the best that we can
1795760	1802880	do. So clocks measure time and time is what measure, clocks measure changing time and time is what
1802880	1814160	clocks measure. And so, but to my opinion, because microscopic physics is reversible, except at the
1814160	1818960	moment of quantum measurement, it may be just like with the twin paradox, and you know I have twins
1818960	1823360	and I get to do experiments on twins all the time, something I share with a lot of physicists, David
1823360	1830240	Kaiser, Sabina Hossenfelder, Peter Diamandes, we all have twins, some of us have Boy Girl twins,
1830240	1836880	and that makes it even more fun. But anyway, you know, the kind of the classic twin paradox
1836880	1842160	which you talk about in your book on Einstein and the unfinished revolution at some level,
1842160	1848480	the question is, you know, two twins set out, one sets out at close to the speed of light,
1848480	1853840	turns around after a rocket voyage and comes back to Earth, the other twin gets, you know,
1853840	1858480	seems to have aged a lot on Earth, even though they seem to be moving at relativistic speeds,
1858480	1863120	each one experiences the other one moving relativistically, but it's the one that undergoes
1863120	1868880	the acceleration when he or she turns back and comes back. So at that moment, that instantaneous
1868880	1875120	moment, it's almost as if all the acceleration of time takes place. And I wonder, is that not
1875120	1880640	possible on the micro scale? In other words, yes, the microscopic laws of physics are immutable,
1880640	1884240	they're time irreversible, until you do a measurement. And then that measurement, that's
1884240	1889440	where all the time, you know, directionality of time takes place. Here's how I've been thinking
1889440	1899120	about it lately. And which is some of which comes from that last book, Einstein's Unfinished
1899120	1906000	Revolution. And some of it is recent work with another collaborator, he was clearly over a day.
1906880	1917680	And, and it was basically her idea. So she came to me and she said, so I start, I think,
1917680	1924880	I worry about the distinction between the past, the present, and the future. And so,
1925440	1932400	um, my friend Carlo and lots of people believe that there's no objective distinction between
1932400	1941120	the past, present, and the future. And I do, I think that the time is now, now is real. And,
1943520	1951680	and that that matters to stating the laws of physics. And the question is certainly the
1951680	1957600	present is real, but is the past is the future? And how does this relate to quantum mechanics?
1957600	1964720	So clearly his idea, which turned out when we looked into it, to, to have quite a legacy,
1964720	1975200	which I'll come to, is that the future realm is indefinite. And everything that from quantum
1975200	1981440	physics is indefinite, that is a part of the superposition, click go this way, click go this way,
1981440	1987040	is part of the future. That is the wave function, the quantum state is a description of the future.
1987600	1996880	And what the present is, is the resolution of indefiniteness and ambiguities to definiteness is,
1996880	2006080	because the past is always only definite. And I was really interested in that and shook up by that.
2006080	2012080	And then I started to ask some friends, and it turns out that Heisenberg said this
2012880	2019920	quite precisely. It's not, it's hard to find, but Heisenberg said this in Schrodinger and Freeman
2019920	2025120	Dyson, quite at length in one quote you can find, which of course we put in the paper.
2026000	2036640	So that's, and this is a new idea, so it could be wrong, but I'm kind of, I find it very interesting,
2036640	2047440	this idea that, that what the present is, is the resolution of indefiniteness and ambiguities.
2048400	2051680	And so let's play, let's think about that more.
2054000	2059200	Yeah, I wonder if, you know, some of the most interesting things in physics come about because
2059200	2065600	of anomalies. And those anomalies are really the things that make you sit up and notice, as you
2065600	2071120	know, I'm a pilot and, you know, an anomaly in the cockpit is a flashing red light, you know, and
2071120	2075680	you ignore that at your peril. And I think, you know, those are some of the greatest gifts that
2075760	2081200	physicists have. And one of the greatest gifts that we got was in the 1950s, when we noticed the
2081200	2087760	parody and chirality of nature was not a perfectly obeyed symmetry. But we do think, you know,
2087760	2092400	correct me if I'm wrong, that the combination of discrete symmetries, charge, parody, and time
2092400	2100080	reversal is respected. But I wonder, this is work you did with Joao Magaizio and others on
2100080	2106560	chiral gravitational waves in 2008 that had some startling predictions. But I remember one line
2106560	2113360	in particular that Stefan really drove home to me was that you make the claim that if the laws of
2113360	2119600	physics are unified, and if the electroweak sector, you know, violates parody, as we know it does,
2120480	2125200	then if gravity becomes unified with the electroweak sector, then it's almost unavoidable,
2125280	2129760	that gravity will have some chirality. And I guess this is characterized by this
2129760	2134000	Emiritese parameter, etc. Can you say more as you're thinking on that evolve? That was one of the
2134000	2139120	most, you know, kind of, you know, earth shattering bombshells that I ever heard, because it meant
2139120	2144640	that in my field, we might see bigger chiral anomalies in the cosmic microwave background that
2144640	2151120	might illuminate physics beyond the standard model indicative of Lorentz invariance violation,
2151120	2161280	which is more startling to me than inflation. Yeah, me too. I think I don't know if I have
2161280	2168560	anything new to say. I'm very grateful for your interest and other observers who have taken these
2168560	2180320	things seriously enough to really look for them. But let me, here's something which fascinates me.
2182080	2189600	Generalitity. And I'm not assuming that our listeners, your listeners are experts in physics,
2189600	2196320	but generalitity has a reputation of being difficult, partly because the Einstein equation
2196320	2202320	is really complicated. And it's a function of this thing, the metric that measures distances,
2202320	2207440	but you've got the inverse of the metric and the determinant of the metric in the square root,
2207440	2217520	the determinant of the metric. And it's a mess to compute with, and it's sure a mess to make
2217520	2225600	quite a mechanical. So what Abay used turned out, we didn't know that, we didn't know that at the
2225600	2237280	time, but a Polish physicist was a refugee to Mexico named Plobanski had discovered something
2237280	2244080	wonderful, which is that you can look at the Einstein equations from a kind of different
2244080	2252560	point of view, which is chiral, that is where you only focus on how the left-hand and neutrinos
2252560	2259440	are react to a gravitational wave, and not the right-hand and neutrinos. And if you do that,
2260160	2266480	you get equations which are just quadratic equations, period. There's no determinants,
2266480	2271360	there's no square roots, there's no inverses, it's just quadratic equations. And if something
2271360	2277200	were simpler than that, it would be linear, and then we get those linear or linear equations
2277840	2283680	we can solve. So it's as simple as it can get while still being non-trivial.
2284560	2294000	And loop quantum gravity, the reason why all those ideas worked is because Abay rediscovered
2294000	2302640	Plobanski's formulation. So now, so that makes me wonder, does nature know about this?
2304960	2312080	And so for example, Roger Penrose's great construction, I mean he's done so many great
2312080	2318720	things, but to grade it, in my opinion, is Twister theory, which has found a lot of use in particle
2318720	2326320	physics and string theory and quantum gravity, but of its own is a very radical idea. And Twister
2326320	2332880	theory has this chirality built into it. The left-handed gravitational waves are described in
2332880	2337920	a way that's different than the right-handed gravitational wave. Interesting. So that was
2337920	2343280	an earlier yes, and you do speak about that in the book, and also Roger's been a guest four times on
2343280	2349360	the show as well. And his 90th birthday is coming up, and I'm delighted to be asked to speak on
2349360	2357440	behalf of that wonderful occasion. And that'll be something to celebrate in August, I believe,
2357440	2362640	is his 90th birthday. It's quite amazing. And thinking about his late-grade colleague, Stephen
2362640	2370320	Hawking, who passed away three years ago, it's hard to believe. And this notion that he kind of
2370320	2376160	died without having unified quantum mechanics with gravity, I've been having this provocative
2376160	2384000	statement, Lee, and at the risk of insulting my mentor, Lee Smolin and friend, I don't know that
2384000	2389840	gravity has to be unified with quantum mechanics. I mean, after all, there are only two situations
2389840	2395600	to my knowledge at which the quantization of gravity, the failure of gravity to play nice
2395600	2400800	with quantum mechanics becomes important. And that's near a singularity in a black hole,
2400800	2405520	and near the origin of the universe, if indeed it began with a singularity, which Sir Roger,
2405520	2409840	as you know, does not believe it did, and Paul Steinhardt does not believe it did,
2409840	2414000	and many others do not believe it did. Neil Turok, your colleague, does not believe it did.
2414720	2419120	And so there's one very questionable scenario that could get ticked off, that we don't have to
2419120	2425440	worry about quantum gravity in that scenario. And a black hole once below the event horizon is
2425440	2432000	you know better than almost anybody else. We cannot observe the details, what happens in
2432000	2437680	the singularity inside the event horizon stays inside the event horizon. So why do we care? I
2437680	2443360	mean, would there be any signature of quantum gravity outside the event horizon? And that would
2443360	2448400	be the own, or are there other scenarios in addition to physics beyond the event horizon
2448400	2452880	that is relevant to the mandate that we must quantize gravity?
2453760	2459600	Very good. So I'm going to give you another reason. I mean, I'm very interested in the idea of quantum
2459600	2466320	gravity. I don't think there's an open and shut case that we shouldn't quantify. But here's something
2466320	2475120	I've been fascinated by since graduate school days. And in, I'll tell the background, in graduate
2475120	2482480	school days, I got interested in Einstein, I was always interested in Einstein. And I had a friend
2482560	2488880	who was a historian of physics, Amelia Michelle Cohn. And she made a proposal to me. She said,
2489520	2497600	why don't we read all of Einstein's papers from the beginning, at least the first 10 years or so.
2498160	2504080	And very few of them were in English except the three or four classes. But why don't we start
2504080	2510720	with his very first paper, which was on thermodynamics and light, and read with her
2510720	2519040	translator and read forward. And so we did that. And there was a thing that was very apparent
2519840	2525600	as we did that, which is that he was enormously interested in the consequences of applying
2525600	2534880	thermodynamic ideas to light. And therefore, he was very interested in the situation, which is
2534880	2542080	called the ultraviolet catastrophe, where if you make a box with conductors, and you must,
2542080	2550080	you must actually know how to do this. And you put some light, you have a little hole,
2550080	2556880	and you put some light in, and you close the hole, the light bounces around. It doesn't interact with
2556880	2562400	itself, it interacts with the walls where the conductors are, and it thermalizes itself. It
2562400	2567600	bounces, and bounces, and bounces, and bounces, and thermalizes itself. And then you open a little
2567600	2572560	hole, and you put a spectrograph there, and it comes out the black body spectrum.
2574640	2581600	And that was really interesting for Einstein, because the black body spectrum, without even
2581600	2587440	having the form of the spectrum, although he did actually, of course, this was after Planck, so he
2587440	2596080	knew Planck's guess. And it was obvious that classical physics couldn't explain the fall-off
2596080	2605120	at the high frequency, either the minus h bar omega over the temperature, basically.
2606240	2615360	And this was a reason why you had to quantize electromagnetism, was to prevent that
2617600	2626560	spectrum from just going out unstably to infinity. And so we read that in several different versions,
2626560	2635040	and I thought, I wonder if you could make gravity waves do that. That is, if you could make gravity
2635040	2641200	waves, put them in a box, and force them into a catastrophe, which you had to save by saying there
2641200	2648000	were gravitons. And then h bar omega, because the energy applied to gravity as well, to gravitational
2648000	2656960	waves as well. And you know what? You can't do it. You can't make the analog of conducting
2656960	2666240	planes, which reflect and keep confined gravitational waves. You can show,
2667200	2675360	and I managed, I'm not that good at this kind of stuff, but I managed a derailation of the
2676640	2684800	efficiency of reflection of gravitational waves off a wall made of any material. And as long as
2684800	2691040	the speed of sound of that material is less than the speed of light, and the thing is not a black hole
2691120	2698720	in the energy, the positivity of energy, the conditions are met, then you can show that the
2698720	2705280	efficiency is bounded way, way, way away from one. And the gravitational wave just sorters outside
2705280	2714480	the box. Never is forced to come to equilibrium. And you can even build on that and show that in
2714480	2720800	the history of the universe of gravitational waves, you'll never come to equilibrium. That is,
2722160	2730960	at any time since the Big Bang and the Big Bang picture, the mean free time of gravitational waves
2730960	2738560	is longer than the cosmic time. And you can show it in equality. So I think that's a little,
2738560	2741840	there's an interesting bit of physics that supports you.
2743840	2753280	Interesting. And if you look out at kind of other tests that one could devise, it's natural to kind
2753280	2761680	of look at, look for tests that could potentially be crisp or decisive tests, as there's a word for
2761760	2769840	this in Latin, you know, critical tests that could not, the theory could not survive otherwise,
2769840	2775040	but to pass this test. The bending of light by massive objects, the Eddington experiment is
2775040	2780080	often cited as such an example, even though many experimentalists doubt that it was really,
2780080	2786000	truly feasible in the technology back in 1919 to truly verify the level of precision that
2786000	2789280	Einstein achieved. But nevertheless, we won't get into that. People can read your book.
2790160	2795920	And Jim Gates's books and other books about Einstein, of which there are many. But I want to
2795920	2801920	turn to the other aspect, which kind of fascinates me and also dismayes me about string theory,
2801920	2807200	but about kind of all theories of everything. And our mutual friend, Max Tegmark, has written
2807200	2813200	about these, and that's really the multiverse. And this is quite disturbing in some ways,
2814320	2818800	especially not the least of which are the multiverses that Max speaks about,
2818800	2823760	you know, the kind of four levels of multiverses that can exist, including a multiverse in which,
2824480	2830400	you know, the laws of nature can vary from string vacuum to string vacuum. And this is part of
2830400	2835280	the fight I had with Michio Kaku. Of course, you know, he was a gentleman, even if I wasn't.
2835840	2841680	But the argument was, you know, I said to him, you know, you say it's not fair to test string
2841680	2849840	theory, because I have to tell you which of the 10 to the 500th or more vacua we live in. And he
2849840	2854800	said, that's just like solving Newton's equations. How many solutions are there in a Newton's equation?
2854800	2858640	I said, there's an infinite number of solutions to Newton's equation. How many solutions to
2858640	2862560	Maxwell's equation? There's an infinite number. What do you need to solve them? He asked me. I
2862560	2867520	said, boundary conditions, initial conditions. But I said, the situation seems hopeless in string
2867520	2872240	theory. In even more hopeless, maybe, than Max Tegmark would admit. And I think I've discovered
2872240	2878160	a fifth level of the multiverse, Lee, if you'll indulge me and forgive me. Because as I think
2878160	2883360	Rabbi used to say, the Nobel Prize should go to someone who doesn't discover a new particle
2883360	2887840	back in the 30s. But in this case, I think the Nobel Prize should go to someone who doesn't
2887840	2893680	discover a new multiverse. I'm worried that there could be a type of multiverse where not only the
2893680	2898320	laws of physics change, but the laws of logic change. In other words, why should it be that
2898320	2906560	Modus Tolens holds in some universe or two plus two equals four in another universe? And he claims,
2906560	2914240	no, no, no, that was a foolish question. But if there are 10 to the 500 different laws of physics,
2914240	2917120	why should there not be 10 to the 500 different laws of mathematics?
2918000	2926560	So first of all, of course, there are different, I don't know how many there are, but there are
2926560	2935360	different versions of set theory and logic and mathematics, depending on how you answer questions
2935360	2944320	like the continuum hypothesis and the exclusive middle. And there's a whole bunch of different
2944320	2951760	logics in different worlds of mathematics. And that I find that fascinating. Since I'm not
2951760	2956160	a Platonist, I don't believe I don't have to believe that they're real. And any of them are real.
2956960	2968480	But they're, they're, they're, they're structures by which we reason. And it's what you say is
2968480	2977280	interesting. And what I don't know if it's worrying, but it's interesting. And I could come back to
2977280	2982160	that because, because I would think a lot about mathematics and I worry about, especially since
2982160	2993520	I'm not a Platonist. Right. So I do want to talk about this, this third paper that you wrote,
2994400	3001040	co-author with Stefan and six other authors, Geron Lanier, Geron Lanier. Can you say something
3001040	3007280	about him? He's an interesting character. He's, his, his, his affiliation is listed as Microsoft
3007280	3012240	Research in Redmond, Washington. I once met him in Berkeley, California. Can you say something
3012240	3016320	about Geron? I know he's a friend of yours and Stefan's, but he's an interesting character. Is
3016320	3025600	he not? He's a very interesting person. And I, I feel very lucky to have him as a friend and we're,
3025600	3037760	we're very good friends. Geron is speaking about auto-didact, didactics. Geron is almost entirely
3037760	3052960	self-educated. He went to a few schools a few times. He is wonderfully imaginative,
3052960	3060960	wonderfully, he's really quick. He's, he's a great communicator. He's a great writer. He's one of the
3060960	3068720	few people I think of as, you know, this class of people who are endlessly original and have
3068720	3075760	endlessly important things to say. And he does have a lot that's very important to say, whether it's
3075760	3082480	about thinking about artificial intelligence or the role in the economy of the internet companies.
3083280	3088480	And so, and lots and lots of other things besides we were talking about yesterday
3088880	3101120	about a whole lot of these things. Yeah, yeah, go ahead. So here's how that came, came to be.
3102880	3108480	So first of all, I have been interested, as we mentioned, in the idea that the laws of physics
3108480	3114480	could change for a long time. And there was cosmological natural selection, if we discuss,
3115440	3119280	I had another approach or have another approach called the principle of precedence.
3120240	3125920	And Geron is interested in that idea. And over several, maybe even many years,
3126480	3134080	Geron and Stefan are also friends and they're both musicians. One thing, Geron plays an incredible
3134080	3143920	variety of musical instruments from all over the world. And there are so many stories to tell
3145360	3154400	that I'll skip doing that. I'll keep doing that now. Well, there's one, let me just bracket this.
3154400	3160560	This is the time Geron took Stefan and I to meet one that called me. And let me just use this.
3161120	3166560	Can you speak a little closer to the microphone? There's a time that Geron took Stefan and I to
3166560	3172880	meet one that called me. Oh, that's right. Which stands out in my as one of the very fortunate
3173760	3182160	experiences I've had. Geron has, Geron is, among other things, a computer scientist.
3182160	3186640	So we didn't even get to that. He is credited with inventing virtual reality.
3187600	3196880	And his position in Microsoft, I don't really understand it, but it seems to allow him complete
3196880	3203040	freedom to do whatever he wants and think about whatever he wants. But he's also involved clearly
3203040	3213520	in projects there. And so anyway, over years, he and Stefan and I talked about a variety of
3213520	3219680	different ideas. And I don't know where the key idea in the paper comes from. I try to think of it.
3221600	3228240	The key idea in the paper is that we can talk about the laws of nature
3229200	3236080	learning and learning the laws and finding the its way around those
3236800	3242960	vacuums that you're worried about to one that is somehow benefits the universe best.
3243760	3249840	And this sounds crazy. And what we're going to argue is the following.
3252880	3257680	There's a lot in that paper that's an 80 page paper about what learning is because we had to do
3257680	3264720	it because it couldn't find you anywhere. But let me skip that and say that people are interested
3264720	3273760	in these machine learning algorithms. And let's just give me that what they do is to learn.
3274400	3279840	They learn facial recognition, they learn pattern recognition, they learn bunches of other things.
3279840	3285520	And let's not get into the epistemology of what it means to say that one of those machines or
3285520	3292400	algorithms learn something. You just give it to me that they learn. And I'm going to take
3293360	3300560	your favorite candidate for the laws of nature as long as they're of the form of something like
3300560	3305200	general relativity and something like gauge fields and fermions and scanners.
3306240	3315440	And we're going to map that theory into the learning machines and machine learning algorithms.
3316400	3322880	And we discovered that map. I don't remember why we were looking for it.
3322880	3329680	But at some point it became clear that there was a map. And the map uses a technical result
3330480	3335760	which I knew and which has to do with a class of models called matrix models.
3336640	3343920	And that's just the technicality that was used. So we demonstrated that result.
3344880	3355760	And then we have thought about what devices you could make that could be mapped to the
3356640	3367040	laws of nature to investigate this idea. There were seven people on the paper. Everyone was essential.
3367520	3378960	And they range from a senior Microsoft computer scientist who was kind of
3380320	3387280	bringing in all of the knowledge about machine learning. Will Cunningham,
3387280	3394080	who's a very talented young theoretical physicist who unfortunately were losing
3394080	3404160	at the moment to the world of startups. And it was a lot of fun. It was really hard. I haven't
3404160	3411840	worked on anything. You work in collaborations all the time. And for me it was kind of a new
3411840	3418960	experience to work in a collaboration that much. And it really did work and it came together. But
3418960	3424560	it took a year. That's a full year meeting together three times a week.
3425920	3430160	That's great. And you don't know what's in the Cunningham floor. There's a whole bunch of stuff.
3430720	3435680	Yeah, I believe it. Yeah, so I'll try to get Geron and Stefan on the podcast at some point too.
3435680	3440080	Stefan's been on three or four times already, but I've never met, I've never had Geron on.
3440080	3445680	I'm going to have Nathan Mirwald on who was director of research at Microsoft for a while and is
3445680	3451920	kind of an autodidact. And maybe that'll segue to my final question for this interview. I hope
3451920	3458560	you'll give us the opportunity to talk more about physics and in the intervening month or so before
3458560	3464400	we can talk again about maybe we'll do a dedicated cosmology talk next time. You'll probably write
3464400	3472640	10 other papers and three books. But I do want to talk just once about, I see you as an autodidact.
3472640	3478800	You've written papers in economics. You've written papers in, as you say, set theory and physics and
3478800	3487120	cosmology. You've written six books to date. And speaking of learning, as we just did with
3487760	3493120	computer learning, do you think you can teach creativity, Lee? Can you teach someone to be
3493120	3500400	imaginative, to be creative? Is there a nature-nurture thing? You just have to be born with it.
3501280	3512880	That's a very good question. And I don't know. I certainly believed that it was teachable most
3512880	3521520	of my life. And I would hope that that's true, because being creative is a great thing. And I
3521520	3530320	would hope that everybody, however their life was organized, had access to that. And it
3530320	3537600	doesn't mean that you're good at it. I mean, I'm not a good musician. I got, unlike Stefan,
3537600	3544320	he is a good musician. I got good enough to play with the people who are really good. And then it
3544320	3553760	was like, okay, that's not my genre. But I still have a few guitars and still play them sometimes.
3554000	3566720	And I'm working with two people now that are unusual people to be working with. And they're
3566720	3579440	endlessly creative and smart. And I don't know where it comes from. I, you know, Jared, Stefan,
3580240	3588480	Thalia, so many people I've been fortunate enough to know, have their own ideas about everything.
3589360	3597360	They look at the world, the same world I look at. They read the same stuff. And they come up with
3597360	3604320	stuff just, it's like turning on a faucet. Stuff that's worth thinking about and worth listening to.
3605280	3613920	And I don't know, I don't know where that comes from. There are certainly cranes that you can't
3613920	3630480	teach it. And the, but I'm going to, I'm going to take a left turn on you. Here's what I think is
3630560	3637360	changeable. And, and I hope I don't sound like, I don't know, I mean, some moralistic
3638160	3646080	something. And people are going to look like he said that. But let me try it. I think character
3646080	3655600	matters enormously. And being in this crisis that we've been, I see it every day. And I think that
3655920	3668320	the ability to see clearly what's going on around you and take responsibility for it and think about
3668320	3675120	it. The ability to follow your own compass, to not care as fine and put it, whatever people think.
3675200	3686480	And I think, and I have a friend I've learned a lot from, St. Clair Simen, who's a sculptor,
3686480	3692480	who's a great sculptor. And so I'm going to leave it with a kind of quote of St. Clair.
3693280	3703200	St. Clair used to tell me that, that you get sort of into your twenties for free.
3704320	3711200	And if you're, if you're going to go on and become useful and really make a contribution
3711200	3718560	with what you do, it really starts to matter what your character is and how much you're willing to
3719120	3732160	be on the edge and take risks and question yourself. And by 50 and 60, it really, it really
3732160	3740400	shows. It really starts to show. He was probably 40 something. And I'm about 10 years younger than him.
3741040	3744160	And then I'll say something else. You don't have to keep this in the tape.
3745120	3753680	No, it's great. But this is, I'm saying this to you from him anyway. Unlike you,
3756640	3765440	we had children late and had to be and talked about it and thought about it.
3766640	3771920	And he had his daughter a few years before we had time. And he said to me,
3772880	3781440	you have no idea what you're giving to the world by having a child. You're un-murdering somebody.
3783120	3790320	And you're giving this to the much higher degree than I am. But I am certainly fully
3790320	3795840	involved. And it is a great thing to do. You know, that's, it's wonderful that you say that,
3795840	3799840	Lee. And actually I was going to close with this to give us some time between our next
3799840	3804880	conversation. But I did want to say that I once heard, you know, Sam Harris talking about,
3804880	3809840	you know, the impossibility of, you know, teleportation and, you know, time travel.
3809840	3813520	It's kind of this, this fantasy that human beings have. And I said, no, that's, that's actually
3813520	3817840	a lie. I didn't say it to him because, you know, he won't pick up the phone when I call him. But,
3817840	3822720	but anyway, I said, actually, there is such a thing as teleportation. It's just you can't
3822720	3829120	teleport yourself. You teleport your values, you teleport your ethics, you teleport your character
3829120	3833280	into the future. And it's called children. And it doesn't even have to be your biological
3833280	3839280	children, Lee. It's your ideological children. And I count myself. And I don't blame you. But
3839840	3844960	I count myself as kind of one of your ideological children. So, you know, I have a great, you know,
3844960	3849360	friend, you know, her name is Melanie Notkin. She's known as the savvy auntie. She can't have
3849360	3853600	children. She didn't have children, whatever. She has influenced thousands of millions of people,
3853600	3857200	even though she didn't have biological children. So I am blessed to have biological children.
3857200	3864000	But even if someone is not, you can act like a parent. You can communicate and thereby doing
3864000	3870160	teleport yourself into the future. And what else is there, Lee? That's time travel. And, and,
3870160	3873760	and you've done that for me and you've done that for millions of people. I just want to thank you
3873760	3879520	so much, Lee, for being, being such a great human being and being an influence on me even long before
3879520	3883760	you knew me. And, and again, you don't get any of the blame for anything bad I do with your good
3883760	3892480	influence. Whoa, Brian, that's the, thank you. I have no words. Thank you. Well, Lee, thank you
3892480	3899120	so much for going into the impossible. I hope you enjoyed this episode with Lee Smolen. If you did,
3899120	3903920	you'll definitely want to check out this episode with Lee and Eric Weinstein. You'll also want to
3903920	3909440	check out other theories of everything, including critics of string theory, just like Lee, featuring
3909440	3918800	Sabina Hassenfelder and Carlo Revelli. Click this playlist right here.
