WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.800
Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.

00:12.800 --> 00:20.720
A legendary figure in my life, in physics, in cosmology, in philosophy, in mathematics,

00:20.720 --> 00:25.160
and that is Professor Lee Smolin joining us from the Perimeter Institute, our neighbor

00:25.160 --> 00:26.160
to the north.

00:26.160 --> 00:28.080
Lee Smolin, how are you today, my friend?

00:28.400 --> 00:33.520
I'm very well, thank you, and thank you very much for the kind words and the invitation.

00:34.160 --> 00:39.920
Lee, you've made fundamental contributions in many different aspects of cosmology, of physics,

00:39.920 --> 00:46.800
philosophy, but what I first wanted to turn to is the influence that you had on me as a

00:46.800 --> 00:54.160
younger physicist, as a beginning professor back in 2006, when you're really a pockle book called

00:54.240 --> 00:56.240
The Trouble with Physics came out.

00:56.240 --> 01:01.520
This book influenced me and a whole generation of physicists, both theoreticians and experimentalists

01:01.520 --> 01:08.480
like myself, and there are very few books that in physics that are relevant 14, 15, 16,

01:08.480 --> 01:12.400
four years, three years, two years after they're written, let alone 15 years after.

01:12.400 --> 01:17.200
And in this book, which I reread, re-listened to recently in preparation for this interview,

01:18.000 --> 01:22.800
I noted that you were talking about the stagnation in physics in the previous 25 years.

01:22.800 --> 01:27.360
So if I add, I'm not as good at math as you are, but if I add 25 to 15, I get 40.

01:28.480 --> 01:29.360
Wow, I just do.

01:31.360 --> 01:36.240
Do you still stand by that, or do you still observe that same stagnation, to some extent,

01:36.240 --> 01:40.400
in physics, at least in theoretical physics? Obviously, experimental physics is completely

01:40.400 --> 01:41.040
different.

01:41.040 --> 01:45.840
There are certainly areas which are doing very well. There are areas of quantum materials where

01:45.840 --> 01:50.080
the theory is really interesting, and I love thinking about it.

01:50.960 --> 01:59.840
I think it's still true that we have not made a fundamental discovery experimentally,

01:59.840 --> 02:03.520
that we explained theoretically, or theoretically posited something

02:04.160 --> 02:06.320
that was discovered experimentally.

02:07.360 --> 02:13.120
And we still don't know the why questions about the standing model.

02:13.120 --> 02:19.520
Why though? There are now something like 30 parameters, including now that the neutrino

02:19.520 --> 02:24.000
has mass, including the masses and the mixing angles of the neutrino.

02:24.640 --> 02:30.800
And we have no explanation for what the values of those dimensions are,

02:31.920 --> 02:39.200
nor for the strength of the gravitational constant, nor for the dark energy or the cosmological

02:39.280 --> 02:49.760
constant. And I went into physics to understand why the universe was the way it is.

02:50.400 --> 02:58.240
And there's lots about that we can get into. The universe is not just some random set of

02:58.240 --> 03:06.240
numbers out there. The universe is enormously structured and organized and self-organized,

03:06.320 --> 03:13.120
and that seems to be at least partly due to those constants being in certain narrow windows,

03:14.000 --> 03:19.040
where there are lots of chemical and nuclear reactions that can take place.

03:20.000 --> 03:30.640
So I think I stand by that. We have ideas about quantum gravity, and we have more ideas than

03:30.640 --> 03:36.800
we did 15 years ago. None of them have some of them make experimental predictions,

03:36.800 --> 03:44.880
but none of those predictions have enough to help. There's always the default, as you would know,

03:44.880 --> 03:50.800
we've looked for the rent symmetry breaking at the Planck scale and around the Planck scale,

03:50.800 --> 03:57.360
using astrophysical experiments. And the evidence is that it's not there. And there's a number of

03:57.920 --> 04:06.080
anomalies that we've looked for, and they're not there. So it's a very frustrating period.

04:06.080 --> 04:12.320
When we look at alternatives to string theory, which has become and still remains a dominant

04:12.320 --> 04:19.040
paradigm, I've had conversations with Carla Revelli, who's become a dear friend. And actually,

04:19.040 --> 04:23.520
we are collaborating together. And he is another person, I thank you for putting me

04:23.520 --> 04:27.680
in touch with many years ago. And we are collaborating on the first ever audio book

04:27.680 --> 04:35.840
version of Galileo Galilei's dialogue on two chief world systems. Yeah, it's going to be amazing

04:35.840 --> 04:41.600
with another Italian physicist, along with Jim Gates reading a foreword from Galileo,

04:41.600 --> 04:45.920
Fabiola Gianate, and others. Stay tuned for more information about that. You can get more if you

04:45.920 --> 04:53.040
subscribe to my newsletter at bryankeating.com. But I want to turn our attention to some surprising

04:53.040 --> 04:58.080
developments that I had talking with a string theory proponent. And that was Michio Kaku,

04:58.080 --> 05:03.920
who came on my podcast recently in promotion of his new book, The God Equation, which he claims,

05:03.920 --> 05:08.800
you know, string theory is responsible for a series of successes, not stagnations, even even

05:08.800 --> 05:17.040
such things like the G minus two anomaly and the LHC beauty experiment anomaly, that these

05:17.040 --> 05:23.360
things are hints, tantalizing hints of the efficacy of string theory. And I pushed back, Lee, you

05:23.360 --> 05:28.080
know, I'm only a simple experimentalist, I said, but I said, to my knowledge, and you, Lee, can

05:28.080 --> 05:33.680
correct me if I'm wrong. Nobody looked at string theory and said, hmm, let's predict this correction

05:33.680 --> 05:40.160
to the G minus two from string theory. And he pushed back on me and said, well, nobody did that

05:40.160 --> 05:45.520
from loop quantum gravity, because loop quantum gravity is so simplistic, it doesn't even have

05:45.520 --> 05:52.640
fermions in it. And I said, because I'm just a fool, I don't, I didn't know how to answer him,

05:52.640 --> 05:56.960
you know, and then we say in Judaism know how to answer a heretic. So I didn't know how to

05:56.960 --> 06:01.360
answer him. How would you have answered him, Michio Kaku, when he says loop quantum gravity,

06:01.360 --> 06:06.640
which you are one of its foremost exponents, along with Abbas, Abe Ashdekar, and Carlo and

06:06.640 --> 06:10.480
others. But Lee, how should I have answered him? I'm sorry, I let you down, but how should I have

06:10.480 --> 06:17.840
answered him? No, the way to end there, first of all, loop quantum gravity is a method. It's not,

06:17.840 --> 06:28.080
in my understanding, a theory. It's a method of studying systems whose forces are described by

06:28.080 --> 06:33.200
gauge fields. And we can talk about what that means, like the standard model of general relativity.

06:34.000 --> 06:41.280
And that method applied to general relativity yields some very interesting descriptions of what

06:41.840 --> 06:48.240
the geometry of the world might be on very small scales. That is 10 to the minus 30 something of

06:48.240 --> 06:56.000
a centimeter. That method can be applied to theories with fermions. And there are,

06:56.080 --> 07:03.840
then, fermions behave like fermions. So there's no problem including fermions. There's no problem

07:03.840 --> 07:11.040
coupling to gauge fields and coupling to the scalar and the fermions of the standard model.

07:12.000 --> 07:20.320
There is a very interesting issue about chirality, which I know is an issue in cosmology and

07:20.320 --> 07:27.680
astronomy that we've worked on a lot and thought about. So we have some issues about chirality,

07:28.320 --> 07:40.160
which I'm happy to admit. My feeling, and I hope I can say this without sounding egotistical or

07:40.160 --> 07:51.040
something. The people you mentioned, Abai and Carlo and I, are thought of often as the founders

07:51.040 --> 07:59.280
of the quantum gravity, the inventors. But let's break, if it's interesting, let's break that down.

08:00.160 --> 08:10.640
Abai brought into being an approach to general relativity based on seeing the

08:11.760 --> 08:16.320
geometry of space and time like a gauge theory. And I can tell you what that means.

08:17.920 --> 08:28.560
It means we care more about measuring how things like fingers or spins move around when you move

08:28.560 --> 08:41.200
around space. That's called the connection. The connection tells things. And my first role,

08:41.200 --> 08:48.080
I guess I had many, but my first role was that there was a whole bunch of beautiful ideas and

08:48.080 --> 08:56.960
technology, theoretical technology, that had been developed about QCD, mainly by a Russian school,

08:56.960 --> 09:06.240
Sasha Pavlikov, Gribov, McDowell. And there were also some Americans, principally, Ken Wilson.

09:06.960 --> 09:14.560
And they had a beautiful picture in which, well, do you know, or do your listeners know, that if you

09:14.560 --> 09:22.480
pass a magnetic field through a superconductor, it becomes discreet. There's a unit of magnetic

09:22.480 --> 09:32.400
flux that that flux line will take on in this organization. And their hypothesis going,

09:32.400 --> 09:38.960
well, it was also due to Holger Nielsen and a number of other people, was that in QCD, which is

09:38.960 --> 09:47.920
sort of like a complicated version of electromagnetism with three photons, the electric field flux

09:47.920 --> 09:55.120
would be quantized and discreet. And there was a picture of strings made out of that flux

09:55.680 --> 10:03.680
holding forks together. And I basically stole that. I mean, it's legitimate. That's what we're

10:03.680 --> 10:11.200
doing science. All that picture and technology and said, what if instead of QCD, I plug in the

10:11.200 --> 10:21.280
bias theory about seeing gravity and connection here and use all those beautiful ideas and tools

10:21.280 --> 10:28.640
that I probably call them Ken Wilson. And that was, that was, I got lucky, in some sense, because

10:29.760 --> 10:34.720
where and when I went to graduate school, it was immersed in that those ideas and those

10:34.720 --> 10:42.640
technologies. And I was the first to try to apply them to quantum gravity. And I had a picture in

10:42.640 --> 10:52.880
my head of loops and areas being quantized and so forth. And that picture with a lot of input

10:52.880 --> 11:00.400
from other people became quantum gravity. And particularly, Carlos brought a very important

11:00.400 --> 11:10.240
picture of how to think of the quantum mechanics of all that. But now, but now it's, that was the

11:10.240 --> 11:18.880
middle 80s, I want to count, that's a long time ago. I love quantum gravity. It's been a family.

11:19.520 --> 11:28.000
It's been an adventure of friends. But it has problems too. And I'm happy to talk about them.

11:28.000 --> 11:35.840
I'm not, I would not think of myself as a proponent in the sense of somebody who ignores

11:35.840 --> 11:43.920
the issues. I think there are issues. And when I set up a research center, perimeter,

11:44.880 --> 11:50.000
I used a philosophy, which is part of the book you want to talk about the trouble with physics,

11:50.720 --> 11:57.760
which I gained from the philosopher Paul Farahman, which was to get good people from

11:57.760 --> 12:04.480
diverse points of view, and don't privilege one point of view just because I have a legacy

12:05.360 --> 12:11.440
with that theory, get good people who do you think of quantum gravity from several points of view,

12:12.480 --> 12:18.240
and have it and have the conflict, which is what the trouble with physics was about.

12:18.960 --> 12:24.960
Right. So there are people in the loop on gravity world who think that I abandoned them,

12:24.960 --> 12:30.800
and there are people in the rest of the world who think that I'm a loop on gravity guy. And I'm neither.

12:34.560 --> 12:40.960
I really love the way you say that. And, you know, when I think about things, I often wonder,

12:40.960 --> 12:47.280
you know, are we, are we putting the gut before the toe or the toe before the gut? And by that,

12:47.360 --> 12:53.760
I mean, you know, we don't have a good grand unified theory yet, in my opinion, or my understanding.

12:53.760 --> 12:57.760
And yet people want to look for a theory of everything. First of all, I think a theory of

12:57.760 --> 13:02.320
everything. And I think Michio does a disservice, to be honest, by saying that this one inch long

13:02.320 --> 13:07.040
God equation will describe everything. It'll give you soup and nuts, and it'll give you aliens.

13:07.040 --> 13:11.840
It'll give you avatars traveling at the speed of light cruising around the galaxy. It will give

13:11.840 --> 13:16.640
be, you know, and it will win you a Nobel Prize that Einstein couldn't win. And you know how I

13:16.640 --> 13:21.920
feel about the Nobel Prize is hagiographic, you know, kind of idol worship, onanistic idol worship.

13:22.720 --> 13:29.120
Nevertheless, it's important to consider what is the importance of a theory of everything.

13:29.120 --> 13:34.720
And I want to ask you, are we putting the toe before the gut? Should we, in your opinion,

13:34.720 --> 13:38.800
spend more time thinking about how do we unify the theories that, you know, we have

13:38.800 --> 13:42.640
very strong evidence to believe that are unified? I personally don't believe

13:42.640 --> 13:48.240
that we should demand that gravity be unified with quantum mechanics. I hope we can get into that.

13:48.240 --> 13:52.000
But what do you think? Should we focus first on guts before we get to toes?

13:52.960 --> 13:59.440
Well, long before that, let's open up, can we open up to the whole universe?

14:00.320 --> 14:08.800
Yeah. It seems to me there are two kinds of phenomena. They're loosely speaking, they're

14:08.800 --> 14:16.960
phenomena. I mean, we believe you and I and most of our colleagues believe some version of the

14:17.680 --> 14:22.160
laws are pretty stable and they're fundamental laws and we're trying to find out what they are

14:22.160 --> 14:27.760
and they're pretty stable. I actually probably disagree with you or at least with most of our

14:27.760 --> 14:33.360
colleagues. I think those laws are changeable and I think they do change and I think they have

14:33.360 --> 14:39.520
change and I think that because that's the only way we're going to explain the question of why they

14:39.520 --> 14:47.920
have the form that they have. So I'm on the lookout for principles by which the laws can change.

14:48.480 --> 14:55.040
That is, I'm no longer hopeful that there's going to be some magic formula that's going to tell us

14:55.040 --> 15:00.560
what the values of all those planets are. I think it evolved that way because there are consequences

15:01.360 --> 15:09.040
for the natural world, for the physical world, which we can come to. Thinking about it that way,

15:09.040 --> 15:14.800
you have to invoke functional explanation. A functional explanation is an explanation of

15:14.800 --> 15:21.840
something where you use some consequence of what it does in the world. So there are

15:22.800 --> 15:31.520
20 to the thousand different kinds of proteins, roughly. That's 20 different amino acids in

15:31.520 --> 15:39.760
a thousand places. It's a typical protein. That's a whole lot more than the kinds of proteins that

15:39.760 --> 15:46.240
exist on the biosphere that are coded for in the DNA or the RNA of the various creatures,

15:46.880 --> 15:55.440
which are like a million. So any protein that exists is lucky because most of the other

15:55.440 --> 16:02.640
alternate proteins don't exist. And why did it get lucky? It got lucky because, for example,

16:02.640 --> 16:10.640
my code for hemoglobin, which is a fundamental way to move oxygen around within a creature,

16:11.600 --> 16:19.840
and which there's a lot of, along with various variants and so forth. So if you ask why does

16:19.840 --> 16:27.920
hemoglobin exist, sure, you've got to be able to analyze and see the laws of electromagnetism and

16:27.920 --> 16:36.880
so forth, acting inside that crazy, wound-up, folded-up thing. But there's also functional

16:36.880 --> 16:46.400
explanations, and both of them have got to work. And I think that's going to apply to everything.

16:47.120 --> 16:55.600
And I also don't take the mathematics as dogma, as religion, if I can use that. I was at one time,

16:55.600 --> 17:01.440
but I am no longer looking for that mathematical object, which has all the truth of that nature,

17:02.320 --> 17:12.240
to somehow transcend our existence and give our life meaning. I think we give life meaning through

17:12.240 --> 17:20.320
friendship and families and what we believe in and who we love. And the universe kind of thus

17:21.520 --> 17:30.480
is doing the same thing. So I'm not, many of our colleagues are looking for something transcendent

17:30.480 --> 17:35.360
when they want to know what the laws are, what the standard model, what the two unified theories are.

17:36.080 --> 17:43.440
I would love to see some explanation of the structure of the standard model. I've been attending,

17:45.120 --> 17:50.400
we have weird conferences, of course, as you know, some conferences are every week or somewhere every

17:50.400 --> 17:56.640
month. So there's a conference about an idea that used to get you kicked out of the archive,

17:56.720 --> 18:02.240
but it turns out to be solid enough that there are a lot of interesting people doing it,

18:02.240 --> 18:06.960
which is that the standard model has something to do with the number system of actonians.

18:07.840 --> 18:13.760
And that would be cool. But I'd certainly like some explanation. Where does the SU-3,

18:13.760 --> 18:18.640
of course, SU-2 come from? Where does the three generations come from? We all want

18:19.600 --> 18:26.320
some kind of answer to that. And my, I'm willing, I'm in fact, eager to have a functional kind of

18:26.320 --> 18:38.400
example. For example, this might come up later. If you want the universe to reproduce itself

18:38.400 --> 18:45.040
through black holes, which is an idea that I had, you want the upper mass limit of neutron stars

18:45.760 --> 18:49.120
to be as low as possible so that as many supernovas

18:49.840 --> 18:56.560
lead to black holes as opposed to neutron stars. And from that, you can get a prediction that the

18:57.440 --> 19:05.040
heaviest stable neutron star can't be more than two solar masses. And there's, and the reason

19:05.040 --> 19:09.760
is some complicated thing about the strange core, if I won't bore you with, unless you really, really

19:09.760 --> 19:16.240
want. But the thing is that recently, there's better and better evidence that there are some

19:16.240 --> 19:25.360
neutron stars up in 20, I'm sorry, two solar masses, 2.2, and so forth. And if those hold up,

19:26.320 --> 19:37.280
then my theory or my hypothesis is falsified. And I will proudly say so.

19:38.240 --> 19:43.360
Yeah, you talk about that a lot in the book. You talk about, you know, different gamma-ray

19:43.360 --> 19:50.400
burst signatures that could be falsified as of 2006. You have other tests that could be,

19:50.400 --> 19:56.720
you describe them as very exciting variation in the fine structure constant. You point out

19:56.720 --> 20:02.160
as very exciting. And I've, I know that you have extreme, you know, integrity in all ways,

20:02.160 --> 20:05.360
not only personally, but because you, you know, because I know you personally,

20:05.360 --> 20:09.600
but also because publicly, you've talked about how this has gone away, that there's no,

20:09.600 --> 20:14.640
you've stated that you've kind of abandoned that, that hope. And you admit that it was a hope back

20:14.640 --> 20:21.920
in the early part of the, of the, you know, of the 2000s, that these fine structure constant could

20:21.920 --> 20:27.440
be revelatory of new physics, but now it's ruled out. And you accept that and you move on.

20:27.440 --> 20:32.320
I wonder, you know, when I first started hearing about you from my, from my best friend, Stefan,

20:33.280 --> 20:37.760
you know, I always thought that, you know, when I first learned about you, it was like

20:37.760 --> 20:44.560
what Stephen Hawking reputedly said about Jacob Zeldovich. When he met him, he thought that Zeldovich

20:44.560 --> 20:50.960
was like Burbaki, like a collective, a set of people. And I thought that about Smolin. I thought

20:50.960 --> 20:56.720
Smolin was like Satoshi Nakamura or whoever that guy is who supposedly or collective came up with

20:56.800 --> 21:02.880
Bitcoin or blockchain. I want to ask you, you put out three or four papers recently. And some of

21:02.880 --> 21:08.000
them with Stefan, some of them solo papers, this voluminous effort, I think you're writing a paper

21:08.000 --> 21:11.920
right now. I'd like to see your hands, Lee, could you put your hands up so I know that you're not

21:11.920 --> 21:16.960
typing out a paper as we're having this lovely interview. But I want to ask you, what would

21:16.960 --> 21:22.640
a theory of everything look like? Would it be the semi classical Wheeler DeWitt equation that would

21:22.720 --> 21:28.960
be fundamental? Would it be the Schrodinger equation? If gravity is fundamental, some say the

21:28.960 --> 21:34.560
Schrodinger equation. If gravity is emergent, some say it's the latter. Your recent paper is so

21:34.560 --> 21:39.680
fascinating. You have one called the quantum mechanics of the present written with Clea Verde.

21:42.800 --> 21:48.080
And the other one, the symbiotic emergence of space and the quantum. That one is a solo paper.

21:48.080 --> 21:53.920
Let's talk about that firstly, please. What does it mean for space to become emergent? What does

21:53.920 --> 22:03.280
that even mean? What it means is that the organization of space, of things moving in space,

22:04.160 --> 22:12.080
is not fundamental. It's real, for sure. Of course, we see it. But it's not fundamental. And what I

22:12.080 --> 22:20.960
mean is that I'm looking, like many of our colleagues, for a formulation of

22:22.880 --> 22:31.360
theory that is a story about the world and how it's made, that will explain the mysteries of

22:31.360 --> 22:37.440
quantum mechanics. So I'm a little ambitious, for better or worse, to explain the mysteries of

22:37.440 --> 22:45.520
quantum mechanics and resolve those issues like the measurement problem. I want that same structure

22:46.160 --> 22:53.440
to explain general relativity. So to be the quantum theory of gravity, although the fundamental

22:53.440 --> 23:02.720
theory that it's coming from is neither quantum mechanics nor gravity. And after a lot of thinking

23:02.720 --> 23:07.360
and talking, here I've been influenced by a number of people. And it's always important.

23:08.240 --> 23:14.080
I mean, we never do these things alone. So Fortuni Marco Pulo was the first person who said to me,

23:14.960 --> 23:25.040
space does not exist so time can. Space is not in the fundamental list of things that are there

23:25.040 --> 23:30.480
all the way down. But time is. For example, space time is in some fundamental way a different thing

23:30.480 --> 23:39.520
than matter. And if space time is an emergent concept, then it's not really clear what you

23:39.520 --> 23:44.480
would mean by unification. Surely it would not be the unification of matter with gravity.

23:45.360 --> 23:50.720
It might be a way to get gravity out of matter that would be a different sort of,

23:50.720 --> 23:54.320
I guess you could think of it as a unification scenario, but it's a bit different than what

23:54.320 --> 24:00.880
people are considering now. I see. And Roberto Manguibara Hunger, who is a Brazilian philosopher,

24:01.840 --> 24:09.760
was interested in the same kind of things. And we wrote it was hard, but we wrote a very interesting

24:09.760 --> 24:18.000
book together. That book is called The Singular Universe. And the basic idea of that theory,

24:18.000 --> 24:26.080
that theory is now called the causal theory of views. And the basic idea of that theory comes from

24:27.680 --> 24:33.280
Leibniz, the philosopher. And it's that, and it's going to sound a little weird, it's that

24:34.000 --> 24:41.600
the universe is composed of partial views of itself. So what I mean is that at every event,

24:41.600 --> 24:48.480
and this is a theory of events and the causes between events. There might be two events here,

24:48.480 --> 24:53.280
which in some sense are the cause of a third event, which is a cause of the fourth event.

24:54.000 --> 25:03.600
And each event has a past, has the things that led up to causing it. And I call that the view,

25:03.600 --> 25:13.520
that's far from Leibniz. And I take the set of all the views from all the events in the universe

25:14.320 --> 25:24.240
to be what the universe is. And then I apply laws to those. And the main idea

25:26.240 --> 25:31.280
there came from work in common with Julian Barber a long time ago,

25:32.000 --> 25:38.400
which is to measure the complexity of some complex system, whether it's a city or an economy,

25:39.280 --> 25:46.480
or a piece of quantum space and time, by making the views from different events or different

25:46.480 --> 25:54.160
situations, may that be as diverse as possible. And you can write down a numerical measure of that.

25:54.160 --> 26:03.360
And that we take as the quantity that gets extremized to give you the equations of motion.

26:04.960 --> 26:09.840
Physics is often organized in such a way that physics and quantity that gets

26:10.480 --> 26:19.360
extremized and minimized. That's called the action. And so the theory has an action which is related

26:20.160 --> 26:28.000
to what we call between the variety. Now, the one last thing I have to say about how this goes

26:28.000 --> 26:34.160
together is that if you don't have space, you don't have distances between things,

26:34.880 --> 26:40.000
you don't have functions, you don't have fields, you don't have derivatives. So how are you going

26:40.000 --> 26:47.520
to write down dynamics? All the things that we'll go into are writing down some law of a field or

26:47.600 --> 26:54.560
a particle, involve distances or derivatives or fields. And so we don't have any of that,

26:54.560 --> 27:00.800
but what we can do is compare the views. We can ask, you look around where you are,

27:00.800 --> 27:08.240
I look around where I am, and that there's a mathematical language to record that view,

27:08.240 --> 27:16.160
and then they can be compared. And so the whole dynamics that I developed is based on those

27:16.160 --> 27:25.120
comparisons. So that's the basic idea. Then what happens in that paper with, unfortunately,

27:25.120 --> 27:32.080
too many technicalities and so forth, is I derive quantum mechanics from those ideas.

27:33.360 --> 27:36.880
Interesting. Now, you mentioned Julian Barbour, he's an upcoming guest

27:37.440 --> 27:43.840
on the Into the Impossible podcast, and I asked him to ask a question of you,

27:44.480 --> 27:52.720
and then he responded, and then I will ask you to ask him a question that I will convey through

27:52.720 --> 27:57.920
me to him. So his question to you, if you're willing to play this game of time traveling

27:57.920 --> 28:04.800
questions, this is a very inefficient way to use the internet, Lee. I hope you appreciate how

28:04.800 --> 28:10.800
time inefficient this is to talk about time in this way. But anyway, Lee, Julian asks you with

28:10.880 --> 28:18.160
warm regards he sends to you. If time is fundamentally, what is it like? What are its attributes?

28:20.880 --> 28:27.840
Very good. So what we say, and this is in the work we did with Marina Cortes,

28:28.480 --> 28:36.000
developing a prior structure to the theory that was based on slamming, what we say is that

28:36.960 --> 28:42.880
the business of time, so I'm not going to define, I'm going to duck it, I'm going to say

28:43.600 --> 28:51.920
that the business or the work of time is to continually make new events which make up,

28:51.920 --> 28:59.440
so what I want to say, what time is like, is what we experience. That is, we experience the

28:59.440 --> 29:06.560
momentary present and the passage of those moments when new things happen and new things happen.

29:07.360 --> 29:14.320
And that's the business or the mechanism of time to keep choosing what new things get made

29:14.880 --> 29:18.720
and what they, and therefore that chooses what their costs look like.

29:19.600 --> 29:26.560
I talked to Frank Wilczak about time and his basic thesis is that time and entropy are

29:26.560 --> 29:35.120
somehow fundamentally linked. Carlo feels this way as well that the Clausius equation of delta S

29:35.120 --> 29:42.480
is greater than or equal to zero, entropy is, and that things change and that Frank then supplements

29:42.480 --> 29:49.920
that equation with the fact that a clock measures something that is changing and time is what we

29:49.920 --> 29:55.760
call the change in something. So it's sort of a tautology, but it's almost the best that we can

29:55.760 --> 30:02.880
do. So clocks measure time and time is what measure, clocks measure changing time and time is what

30:02.880 --> 30:14.160
clocks measure. And so, but to my opinion, because microscopic physics is reversible, except at the

30:14.160 --> 30:18.960
moment of quantum measurement, it may be just like with the twin paradox, and you know I have twins

30:18.960 --> 30:23.360
and I get to do experiments on twins all the time, something I share with a lot of physicists, David

30:23.360 --> 30:30.240
Kaiser, Sabina Hossenfelder, Peter Diamandes, we all have twins, some of us have Boy Girl twins,

30:30.240 --> 30:36.880
and that makes it even more fun. But anyway, you know, the kind of the classic twin paradox

30:36.880 --> 30:42.160
which you talk about in your book on Einstein and the unfinished revolution at some level,

30:42.160 --> 30:48.480
the question is, you know, two twins set out, one sets out at close to the speed of light,

30:48.480 --> 30:53.840
turns around after a rocket voyage and comes back to Earth, the other twin gets, you know,

30:53.840 --> 30:58.480
seems to have aged a lot on Earth, even though they seem to be moving at relativistic speeds,

30:58.480 --> 31:03.120
each one experiences the other one moving relativistically, but it's the one that undergoes

31:03.120 --> 31:08.880
the acceleration when he or she turns back and comes back. So at that moment, that instantaneous

31:08.880 --> 31:15.120
moment, it's almost as if all the acceleration of time takes place. And I wonder, is that not

31:15.120 --> 31:20.640
possible on the micro scale? In other words, yes, the microscopic laws of physics are immutable,

31:20.640 --> 31:24.240
they're time irreversible, until you do a measurement. And then that measurement, that's

31:24.240 --> 31:29.440
where all the time, you know, directionality of time takes place. Here's how I've been thinking

31:29.440 --> 31:39.120
about it lately. And which is some of which comes from that last book, Einstein's Unfinished

31:39.120 --> 31:46.000
Revolution. And some of it is recent work with another collaborator, he was clearly over a day.

31:46.880 --> 31:57.680
And, and it was basically her idea. So she came to me and she said, so I start, I think,

31:57.680 --> 32:04.880
I worry about the distinction between the past, the present, and the future. And so,

32:05.440 --> 32:12.400
um, my friend Carlo and lots of people believe that there's no objective distinction between

32:12.400 --> 32:21.120
the past, present, and the future. And I do, I think that the time is now, now is real. And,

32:23.520 --> 32:31.680
and that that matters to stating the laws of physics. And the question is certainly the

32:31.680 --> 32:37.600
present is real, but is the past is the future? And how does this relate to quantum mechanics?

32:37.600 --> 32:44.720
So clearly his idea, which turned out when we looked into it, to, to have quite a legacy,

32:44.720 --> 32:55.200
which I'll come to, is that the future realm is indefinite. And everything that from quantum

32:55.200 --> 33:01.440
physics is indefinite, that is a part of the superposition, click go this way, click go this way,

33:01.440 --> 33:07.040
is part of the future. That is the wave function, the quantum state is a description of the future.

33:07.600 --> 33:16.880
And what the present is, is the resolution of indefiniteness and ambiguities to definiteness is,

33:16.880 --> 33:26.080
because the past is always only definite. And I was really interested in that and shook up by that.

33:26.080 --> 33:32.080
And then I started to ask some friends, and it turns out that Heisenberg said this

33:32.880 --> 33:39.920
quite precisely. It's not, it's hard to find, but Heisenberg said this in Schrodinger and Freeman

33:39.920 --> 33:45.120
Dyson, quite at length in one quote you can find, which of course we put in the paper.

33:46.000 --> 33:56.640
So that's, and this is a new idea, so it could be wrong, but I'm kind of, I find it very interesting,

33:56.640 --> 34:07.440
this idea that, that what the present is, is the resolution of indefiniteness and ambiguities.

34:08.400 --> 34:11.680
And so let's play, let's think about that more.

34:14.000 --> 34:19.200
Yeah, I wonder if, you know, some of the most interesting things in physics come about because

34:19.200 --> 34:25.600
of anomalies. And those anomalies are really the things that make you sit up and notice, as you

34:25.600 --> 34:31.120
know, I'm a pilot and, you know, an anomaly in the cockpit is a flashing red light, you know, and

34:31.120 --> 34:35.680
you ignore that at your peril. And I think, you know, those are some of the greatest gifts that

34:35.760 --> 34:41.200
physicists have. And one of the greatest gifts that we got was in the 1950s, when we noticed the

34:41.200 --> 34:47.760
parody and chirality of nature was not a perfectly obeyed symmetry. But we do think, you know,

34:47.760 --> 34:52.400
correct me if I'm wrong, that the combination of discrete symmetries, charge, parody, and time

34:52.400 --> 35:00.080
reversal is respected. But I wonder, this is work you did with Joao Magaizio and others on

35:00.080 --> 35:06.560
chiral gravitational waves in 2008 that had some startling predictions. But I remember one line

35:06.560 --> 35:13.360
in particular that Stefan really drove home to me was that you make the claim that if the laws of

35:13.360 --> 35:19.600
physics are unified, and if the electroweak sector, you know, violates parody, as we know it does,

35:20.480 --> 35:25.200
then if gravity becomes unified with the electroweak sector, then it's almost unavoidable,

35:25.280 --> 35:29.760
that gravity will have some chirality. And I guess this is characterized by this

35:29.760 --> 35:34.000
Emiritese parameter, etc. Can you say more as you're thinking on that evolve? That was one of the

35:34.000 --> 35:39.120
most, you know, kind of, you know, earth shattering bombshells that I ever heard, because it meant

35:39.120 --> 35:44.640
that in my field, we might see bigger chiral anomalies in the cosmic microwave background that

35:44.640 --> 35:51.120
might illuminate physics beyond the standard model indicative of Lorentz invariance violation,

35:51.120 --> 36:01.280
which is more startling to me than inflation. Yeah, me too. I think I don't know if I have

36:01.280 --> 36:08.560
anything new to say. I'm very grateful for your interest and other observers who have taken these

36:08.560 --> 36:20.320
things seriously enough to really look for them. But let me, here's something which fascinates me.

36:22.080 --> 36:29.600
Generalitity. And I'm not assuming that our listeners, your listeners are experts in physics,

36:29.600 --> 36:36.320
but generalitity has a reputation of being difficult, partly because the Einstein equation

36:36.320 --> 36:42.320
is really complicated. And it's a function of this thing, the metric that measures distances,

36:42.320 --> 36:47.440
but you've got the inverse of the metric and the determinant of the metric in the square root,

36:47.440 --> 36:57.520
the determinant of the metric. And it's a mess to compute with, and it's sure a mess to make

36:57.520 --> 37:05.600
quite a mechanical. So what Abay used turned out, we didn't know that, we didn't know that at the

37:05.600 --> 37:17.280
time, but a Polish physicist was a refugee to Mexico named Plobanski had discovered something

37:17.280 --> 37:24.080
wonderful, which is that you can look at the Einstein equations from a kind of different

37:24.080 --> 37:32.560
point of view, which is chiral, that is where you only focus on how the left-hand and neutrinos

37:32.560 --> 37:39.440
are react to a gravitational wave, and not the right-hand and neutrinos. And if you do that,

37:40.160 --> 37:46.480
you get equations which are just quadratic equations, period. There's no determinants,

37:46.480 --> 37:51.360
there's no square roots, there's no inverses, it's just quadratic equations. And if something

37:51.360 --> 37:57.200
were simpler than that, it would be linear, and then we get those linear or linear equations

37:57.840 --> 38:03.680
we can solve. So it's as simple as it can get while still being non-trivial.

38:04.560 --> 38:14.000
And loop quantum gravity, the reason why all those ideas worked is because Abay rediscovered

38:14.000 --> 38:22.640
Plobanski's formulation. So now, so that makes me wonder, does nature know about this?

38:24.960 --> 38:32.080
And so for example, Roger Penrose's great construction, I mean he's done so many great

38:32.080 --> 38:38.720
things, but to grade it, in my opinion, is Twister theory, which has found a lot of use in particle

38:38.720 --> 38:46.320
physics and string theory and quantum gravity, but of its own is a very radical idea. And Twister

38:46.320 --> 38:52.880
theory has this chirality built into it. The left-handed gravitational waves are described in

38:52.880 --> 38:57.920
a way that's different than the right-handed gravitational wave. Interesting. So that was

38:57.920 --> 39:03.280
an earlier yes, and you do speak about that in the book, and also Roger's been a guest four times on

39:03.280 --> 39:09.360
the show as well. And his 90th birthday is coming up, and I'm delighted to be asked to speak on

39:09.360 --> 39:17.440
behalf of that wonderful occasion. And that'll be something to celebrate in August, I believe,

39:17.440 --> 39:22.640
is his 90th birthday. It's quite amazing. And thinking about his late-grade colleague, Stephen

39:22.640 --> 39:30.320
Hawking, who passed away three years ago, it's hard to believe. And this notion that he kind of

39:30.320 --> 39:36.160
died without having unified quantum mechanics with gravity, I've been having this provocative

39:36.160 --> 39:44.000
statement, Lee, and at the risk of insulting my mentor, Lee Smolin and friend, I don't know that

39:44.000 --> 39:49.840
gravity has to be unified with quantum mechanics. I mean, after all, there are only two situations

39:49.840 --> 39:55.600
to my knowledge at which the quantization of gravity, the failure of gravity to play nice

39:55.600 --> 40:00.800
with quantum mechanics becomes important. And that's near a singularity in a black hole,

40:00.800 --> 40:05.520
and near the origin of the universe, if indeed it began with a singularity, which Sir Roger,

40:05.520 --> 40:09.840
as you know, does not believe it did, and Paul Steinhardt does not believe it did,

40:09.840 --> 40:14.000
and many others do not believe it did. Neil Turok, your colleague, does not believe it did.

40:14.720 --> 40:19.120
And so there's one very questionable scenario that could get ticked off, that we don't have to

40:19.120 --> 40:25.440
worry about quantum gravity in that scenario. And a black hole once below the event horizon is

40:25.440 --> 40:32.000
you know better than almost anybody else. We cannot observe the details, what happens in

40:32.000 --> 40:37.680
the singularity inside the event horizon stays inside the event horizon. So why do we care? I

40:37.680 --> 40:43.360
mean, would there be any signature of quantum gravity outside the event horizon? And that would

40:43.360 --> 40:48.400
be the own, or are there other scenarios in addition to physics beyond the event horizon

40:48.400 --> 40:52.880
that is relevant to the mandate that we must quantize gravity?

40:53.760 --> 40:59.600
Very good. So I'm going to give you another reason. I mean, I'm very interested in the idea of quantum

40:59.600 --> 41:06.320
gravity. I don't think there's an open and shut case that we shouldn't quantify. But here's something

41:06.320 --> 41:15.120
I've been fascinated by since graduate school days. And in, I'll tell the background, in graduate

41:15.120 --> 41:22.480
school days, I got interested in Einstein, I was always interested in Einstein. And I had a friend

41:22.560 --> 41:28.880
who was a historian of physics, Amelia Michelle Cohn. And she made a proposal to me. She said,

41:29.520 --> 41:37.600
why don't we read all of Einstein's papers from the beginning, at least the first 10 years or so.

41:38.160 --> 41:44.080
And very few of them were in English except the three or four classes. But why don't we start

41:44.080 --> 41:50.720
with his very first paper, which was on thermodynamics and light, and read with her

41:50.720 --> 41:59.040
translator and read forward. And so we did that. And there was a thing that was very apparent

41:59.840 --> 42:05.600
as we did that, which is that he was enormously interested in the consequences of applying

42:05.600 --> 42:14.880
thermodynamic ideas to light. And therefore, he was very interested in the situation, which is

42:14.880 --> 42:22.080
called the ultraviolet catastrophe, where if you make a box with conductors, and you must,

42:22.080 --> 42:30.080
you must actually know how to do this. And you put some light, you have a little hole,

42:30.080 --> 42:36.880
and you put some light in, and you close the hole, the light bounces around. It doesn't interact with

42:36.880 --> 42:42.400
itself, it interacts with the walls where the conductors are, and it thermalizes itself. It

42:42.400 --> 42:47.600
bounces, and bounces, and bounces, and bounces, and thermalizes itself. And then you open a little

42:47.600 --> 42:52.560
hole, and you put a spectrograph there, and it comes out the black body spectrum.

42:54.640 --> 43:01.600
And that was really interesting for Einstein, because the black body spectrum, without even

43:01.600 --> 43:07.440
having the form of the spectrum, although he did actually, of course, this was after Planck, so he

43:07.440 --> 43:16.080
knew Planck's guess. And it was obvious that classical physics couldn't explain the fall-off

43:16.080 --> 43:25.120
at the high frequency, either the minus h bar omega over the temperature, basically.

43:26.240 --> 43:35.360
And this was a reason why you had to quantize electromagnetism, was to prevent that

43:37.600 --> 43:46.560
spectrum from just going out unstably to infinity. And so we read that in several different versions,

43:46.560 --> 43:55.040
and I thought, I wonder if you could make gravity waves do that. That is, if you could make gravity

43:55.040 --> 44:01.200
waves, put them in a box, and force them into a catastrophe, which you had to save by saying there

44:01.200 --> 44:08.000
were gravitons. And then h bar omega, because the energy applied to gravity as well, to gravitational

44:08.000 --> 44:16.960
waves as well. And you know what? You can't do it. You can't make the analog of conducting

44:16.960 --> 44:26.240
planes, which reflect and keep confined gravitational waves. You can show,

44:27.200 --> 44:35.360
and I managed, I'm not that good at this kind of stuff, but I managed a derailation of the

44:36.640 --> 44:44.800
efficiency of reflection of gravitational waves off a wall made of any material. And as long as

44:44.800 --> 44:51.040
the speed of sound of that material is less than the speed of light, and the thing is not a black hole

44:51.120 --> 44:58.720
in the energy, the positivity of energy, the conditions are met, then you can show that the

44:58.720 --> 45:05.280
efficiency is bounded way, way, way away from one. And the gravitational wave just sorters outside

45:05.280 --> 45:14.480
the box. Never is forced to come to equilibrium. And you can even build on that and show that in

45:14.480 --> 45:20.800
the history of the universe of gravitational waves, you'll never come to equilibrium. That is,

45:22.160 --> 45:30.960
at any time since the Big Bang and the Big Bang picture, the mean free time of gravitational waves

45:30.960 --> 45:38.560
is longer than the cosmic time. And you can show it in equality. So I think that's a little,

45:38.560 --> 45:41.840
there's an interesting bit of physics that supports you.

45:43.840 --> 45:53.280
Interesting. And if you look out at kind of other tests that one could devise, it's natural to kind

45:53.280 --> 46:01.680
of look at, look for tests that could potentially be crisp or decisive tests, as there's a word for

46:01.760 --> 46:09.840
this in Latin, you know, critical tests that could not, the theory could not survive otherwise,

46:09.840 --> 46:15.040
but to pass this test. The bending of light by massive objects, the Eddington experiment is

46:15.040 --> 46:20.080
often cited as such an example, even though many experimentalists doubt that it was really,

46:20.080 --> 46:26.000
truly feasible in the technology back in 1919 to truly verify the level of precision that

46:26.000 --> 46:29.280
Einstein achieved. But nevertheless, we won't get into that. People can read your book.

46:30.160 --> 46:35.920
And Jim Gates's books and other books about Einstein, of which there are many. But I want to

46:35.920 --> 46:41.920
turn to the other aspect, which kind of fascinates me and also dismayes me about string theory,

46:41.920 --> 46:47.200
but about kind of all theories of everything. And our mutual friend, Max Tegmark, has written

46:47.200 --> 46:53.200
about these, and that's really the multiverse. And this is quite disturbing in some ways,

46:54.320 --> 46:58.800
especially not the least of which are the multiverses that Max speaks about,

46:58.800 --> 47:03.760
you know, the kind of four levels of multiverses that can exist, including a multiverse in which,

47:04.480 --> 47:10.400
you know, the laws of nature can vary from string vacuum to string vacuum. And this is part of

47:10.400 --> 47:15.280
the fight I had with Michio Kaku. Of course, you know, he was a gentleman, even if I wasn't.

47:15.840 --> 47:21.680
But the argument was, you know, I said to him, you know, you say it's not fair to test string

47:21.680 --> 47:29.840
theory, because I have to tell you which of the 10 to the 500th or more vacua we live in. And he

47:29.840 --> 47:34.800
said, that's just like solving Newton's equations. How many solutions are there in a Newton's equation?

47:34.800 --> 47:38.640
I said, there's an infinite number of solutions to Newton's equation. How many solutions to

47:38.640 --> 47:42.560
Maxwell's equation? There's an infinite number. What do you need to solve them? He asked me. I

47:42.560 --> 47:47.520
said, boundary conditions, initial conditions. But I said, the situation seems hopeless in string

47:47.520 --> 47:52.240
theory. In even more hopeless, maybe, than Max Tegmark would admit. And I think I've discovered

47:52.240 --> 47:58.160
a fifth level of the multiverse, Lee, if you'll indulge me and forgive me. Because as I think

47:58.160 --> 48:03.360
Rabbi used to say, the Nobel Prize should go to someone who doesn't discover a new particle

48:03.360 --> 48:07.840
back in the 30s. But in this case, I think the Nobel Prize should go to someone who doesn't

48:07.840 --> 48:13.680
discover a new multiverse. I'm worried that there could be a type of multiverse where not only the

48:13.680 --> 48:18.320
laws of physics change, but the laws of logic change. In other words, why should it be that

48:18.320 --> 48:26.560
Modus Tolens holds in some universe or two plus two equals four in another universe? And he claims,

48:26.560 --> 48:34.240
no, no, no, that was a foolish question. But if there are 10 to the 500 different laws of physics,

48:34.240 --> 48:37.120
why should there not be 10 to the 500 different laws of mathematics?

48:38.000 --> 48:46.560
So first of all, of course, there are different, I don't know how many there are, but there are

48:46.560 --> 48:55.360
different versions of set theory and logic and mathematics, depending on how you answer questions

48:55.360 --> 49:04.320
like the continuum hypothesis and the exclusive middle. And there's a whole bunch of different

49:04.320 --> 49:11.760
logics in different worlds of mathematics. And that I find that fascinating. Since I'm not

49:11.760 --> 49:16.160
a Platonist, I don't believe I don't have to believe that they're real. And any of them are real.

49:16.960 --> 49:28.480
But they're, they're, they're, they're structures by which we reason. And it's what you say is

49:28.480 --> 49:37.280
interesting. And what I don't know if it's worrying, but it's interesting. And I could come back to

49:37.280 --> 49:42.160
that because, because I would think a lot about mathematics and I worry about, especially since

49:42.160 --> 49:53.520
I'm not a Platonist. Right. So I do want to talk about this, this third paper that you wrote,

49:54.400 --> 50:01.040
co-author with Stefan and six other authors, Geron Lanier, Geron Lanier. Can you say something

50:01.040 --> 50:07.280
about him? He's an interesting character. He's, his, his, his affiliation is listed as Microsoft

50:07.280 --> 50:12.240
Research in Redmond, Washington. I once met him in Berkeley, California. Can you say something

50:12.240 --> 50:16.320
about Geron? I know he's a friend of yours and Stefan's, but he's an interesting character. Is

50:16.320 --> 50:25.600
he not? He's a very interesting person. And I, I feel very lucky to have him as a friend and we're,

50:25.600 --> 50:37.760
we're very good friends. Geron is speaking about auto-didact, didactics. Geron is almost entirely

50:37.760 --> 50:52.960
self-educated. He went to a few schools a few times. He is wonderfully imaginative,

50:52.960 --> 51:00.960
wonderfully, he's really quick. He's, he's a great communicator. He's a great writer. He's one of the

51:00.960 --> 51:08.720
few people I think of as, you know, this class of people who are endlessly original and have

51:08.720 --> 51:15.760
endlessly important things to say. And he does have a lot that's very important to say, whether it's

51:15.760 --> 51:22.480
about thinking about artificial intelligence or the role in the economy of the internet companies.

51:23.280 --> 51:28.480
And so, and lots and lots of other things besides we were talking about yesterday

51:28.880 --> 51:41.120
about a whole lot of these things. Yeah, yeah, go ahead. So here's how that came, came to be.

51:42.880 --> 51:48.480
So first of all, I have been interested, as we mentioned, in the idea that the laws of physics

51:48.480 --> 51:54.480
could change for a long time. And there was cosmological natural selection, if we discuss,

51:55.440 --> 51:59.280
I had another approach or have another approach called the principle of precedence.

52:00.240 --> 52:05.920
And Geron is interested in that idea. And over several, maybe even many years,

52:06.480 --> 52:14.080
Geron and Stefan are also friends and they're both musicians. One thing, Geron plays an incredible

52:14.080 --> 52:23.920
variety of musical instruments from all over the world. And there are so many stories to tell

52:25.360 --> 52:34.400
that I'll skip doing that. I'll keep doing that now. Well, there's one, let me just bracket this.

52:34.400 --> 52:40.560
This is the time Geron took Stefan and I to meet one that called me. And let me just use this.

52:41.120 --> 52:46.560
Can you speak a little closer to the microphone? There's a time that Geron took Stefan and I to

52:46.560 --> 52:52.880
meet one that called me. Oh, that's right. Which stands out in my as one of the very fortunate

52:53.760 --> 53:02.160
experiences I've had. Geron has, Geron is, among other things, a computer scientist.

53:02.160 --> 53:06.640
So we didn't even get to that. He is credited with inventing virtual reality.

53:07.600 --> 53:16.880
And his position in Microsoft, I don't really understand it, but it seems to allow him complete

53:16.880 --> 53:23.040
freedom to do whatever he wants and think about whatever he wants. But he's also involved clearly

53:23.040 --> 53:33.520
in projects there. And so anyway, over years, he and Stefan and I talked about a variety of

53:33.520 --> 53:39.680
different ideas. And I don't know where the key idea in the paper comes from. I try to think of it.

53:41.600 --> 53:48.240
The key idea in the paper is that we can talk about the laws of nature

53:49.200 --> 53:56.080
learning and learning the laws and finding the its way around those

53:56.800 --> 54:02.960
vacuums that you're worried about to one that is somehow benefits the universe best.

54:03.760 --> 54:09.840
And this sounds crazy. And what we're going to argue is the following.

54:12.880 --> 54:17.680
There's a lot in that paper that's an 80 page paper about what learning is because we had to do

54:17.680 --> 54:24.720
it because it couldn't find you anywhere. But let me skip that and say that people are interested

54:24.720 --> 54:33.760
in these machine learning algorithms. And let's just give me that what they do is to learn.

54:34.400 --> 54:39.840
They learn facial recognition, they learn pattern recognition, they learn bunches of other things.

54:39.840 --> 54:45.520
And let's not get into the epistemology of what it means to say that one of those machines or

54:45.520 --> 54:52.400
algorithms learn something. You just give it to me that they learn. And I'm going to take

54:53.360 --> 55:00.560
your favorite candidate for the laws of nature as long as they're of the form of something like

55:00.560 --> 55:05.200
general relativity and something like gauge fields and fermions and scanners.

55:06.240 --> 55:15.440
And we're going to map that theory into the learning machines and machine learning algorithms.

55:16.400 --> 55:22.880
And we discovered that map. I don't remember why we were looking for it.

55:22.880 --> 55:29.680
But at some point it became clear that there was a map. And the map uses a technical result

55:30.480 --> 55:35.760
which I knew and which has to do with a class of models called matrix models.

55:36.640 --> 55:43.920
And that's just the technicality that was used. So we demonstrated that result.

55:44.880 --> 55:55.760
And then we have thought about what devices you could make that could be mapped to the

55:56.640 --> 56:07.040
laws of nature to investigate this idea. There were seven people on the paper. Everyone was essential.

56:07.520 --> 56:18.960
And they range from a senior Microsoft computer scientist who was kind of

56:20.320 --> 56:27.280
bringing in all of the knowledge about machine learning. Will Cunningham,

56:27.280 --> 56:34.080
who's a very talented young theoretical physicist who unfortunately were losing

56:34.080 --> 56:44.160
at the moment to the world of startups. And it was a lot of fun. It was really hard. I haven't

56:44.160 --> 56:51.840
worked on anything. You work in collaborations all the time. And for me it was kind of a new

56:51.840 --> 56:58.960
experience to work in a collaboration that much. And it really did work and it came together. But

56:58.960 --> 57:04.560
it took a year. That's a full year meeting together three times a week.

57:05.920 --> 57:10.160
That's great. And you don't know what's in the Cunningham floor. There's a whole bunch of stuff.

57:10.720 --> 57:15.680
Yeah, I believe it. Yeah, so I'll try to get Geron and Stefan on the podcast at some point too.

57:15.680 --> 57:20.080
Stefan's been on three or four times already, but I've never met, I've never had Geron on.

57:20.080 --> 57:25.680
I'm going to have Nathan Mirwald on who was director of research at Microsoft for a while and is

57:25.680 --> 57:31.920
kind of an autodidact. And maybe that'll segue to my final question for this interview. I hope

57:31.920 --> 57:38.560
you'll give us the opportunity to talk more about physics and in the intervening month or so before

57:38.560 --> 57:44.400
we can talk again about maybe we'll do a dedicated cosmology talk next time. You'll probably write

57:44.400 --> 57:52.640
10 other papers and three books. But I do want to talk just once about, I see you as an autodidact.

57:52.640 --> 57:58.800
You've written papers in economics. You've written papers in, as you say, set theory and physics and

57:58.800 --> 58:07.120
cosmology. You've written six books to date. And speaking of learning, as we just did with

58:07.760 --> 58:13.120
computer learning, do you think you can teach creativity, Lee? Can you teach someone to be

58:13.120 --> 58:20.400
imaginative, to be creative? Is there a nature-nurture thing? You just have to be born with it.

58:21.280 --> 58:32.880
That's a very good question. And I don't know. I certainly believed that it was teachable most

58:32.880 --> 58:41.520
of my life. And I would hope that that's true, because being creative is a great thing. And I

58:41.520 --> 58:50.320
would hope that everybody, however their life was organized, had access to that. And it

58:50.320 --> 58:57.600
doesn't mean that you're good at it. I mean, I'm not a good musician. I got, unlike Stefan,

58:57.600 --> 59:04.320
he is a good musician. I got good enough to play with the people who are really good. And then it

59:04.320 --> 59:13.760
was like, okay, that's not my genre. But I still have a few guitars and still play them sometimes.

59:14.000 --> 59:26.720
And I'm working with two people now that are unusual people to be working with. And they're

59:26.720 --> 59:39.440
endlessly creative and smart. And I don't know where it comes from. I, you know, Jared, Stefan,

59:40.240 --> 59:48.480
Thalia, so many people I've been fortunate enough to know, have their own ideas about everything.

59:49.360 --> 59:57.360
They look at the world, the same world I look at. They read the same stuff. And they come up with

59:57.360 --> 01:00:04.320
stuff just, it's like turning on a faucet. Stuff that's worth thinking about and worth listening to.

01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:13.920
And I don't know, I don't know where that comes from. There are certainly cranes that you can't

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:30.480
teach it. And the, but I'm going to, I'm going to take a left turn on you. Here's what I think is

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:37.360
changeable. And, and I hope I don't sound like, I don't know, I mean, some moralistic

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:46.080
something. And people are going to look like he said that. But let me try it. I think character

01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:55.600
matters enormously. And being in this crisis that we've been, I see it every day. And I think that

01:00:55.920 --> 01:01:08.320
the ability to see clearly what's going on around you and take responsibility for it and think about

01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:15.120
it. The ability to follow your own compass, to not care as fine and put it, whatever people think.

01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:26.480
And I think, and I have a friend I've learned a lot from, St. Clair Simen, who's a sculptor,

01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:32.480
who's a great sculptor. And so I'm going to leave it with a kind of quote of St. Clair.

01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:43.200
St. Clair used to tell me that, that you get sort of into your twenties for free.

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:51.200
And if you're, if you're going to go on and become useful and really make a contribution

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:58.560
with what you do, it really starts to matter what your character is and how much you're willing to

01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:12.160
be on the edge and take risks and question yourself. And by 50 and 60, it really, it really

01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:20.400
shows. It really starts to show. He was probably 40 something. And I'm about 10 years younger than him.

01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:24.160
And then I'll say something else. You don't have to keep this in the tape.

01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:33.680
No, it's great. But this is, I'm saying this to you from him anyway. Unlike you,

01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:45.440
we had children late and had to be and talked about it and thought about it.

01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:51.920
And he had his daughter a few years before we had time. And he said to me,

01:02:52.880 --> 01:03:01.440
you have no idea what you're giving to the world by having a child. You're un-murdering somebody.

01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:10.320
And you're giving this to the much higher degree than I am. But I am certainly fully

01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:15.840
involved. And it is a great thing to do. You know, that's, it's wonderful that you say that,

01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:19.840
Lee. And actually I was going to close with this to give us some time between our next

01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:24.880
conversation. But I did want to say that I once heard, you know, Sam Harris talking about,

01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:29.840
you know, the impossibility of, you know, teleportation and, you know, time travel.

01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:33.520
It's kind of this, this fantasy that human beings have. And I said, no, that's, that's actually

01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:37.840
a lie. I didn't say it to him because, you know, he won't pick up the phone when I call him. But,

01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:42.720
but anyway, I said, actually, there is such a thing as teleportation. It's just you can't

01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:49.120
teleport yourself. You teleport your values, you teleport your ethics, you teleport your character

01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:53.280
into the future. And it's called children. And it doesn't even have to be your biological

01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:59.280
children, Lee. It's your ideological children. And I count myself. And I don't blame you. But

01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:04.960
I count myself as kind of one of your ideological children. So, you know, I have a great, you know,

01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:09.360
friend, you know, her name is Melanie Notkin. She's known as the savvy auntie. She can't have

01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:13.600
children. She didn't have children, whatever. She has influenced thousands of millions of people,

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:17.200
even though she didn't have biological children. So I am blessed to have biological children.

01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:24.000
But even if someone is not, you can act like a parent. You can communicate and thereby doing

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:30.160
teleport yourself into the future. And what else is there, Lee? That's time travel. And, and,

01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:33.760
and you've done that for me and you've done that for millions of people. I just want to thank you

01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:39.520
so much, Lee, for being, being such a great human being and being an influence on me even long before

01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:43.760
you knew me. And, and again, you don't get any of the blame for anything bad I do with your good

01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:52.480
influence. Whoa, Brian, that's the, thank you. I have no words. Thank you. Well, Lee, thank you

01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:59.120
so much for going into the impossible. I hope you enjoyed this episode with Lee Smolen. If you did,

01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:03.920
you'll definitely want to check out this episode with Lee and Eric Weinstein. You'll also want to

01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:09.440
