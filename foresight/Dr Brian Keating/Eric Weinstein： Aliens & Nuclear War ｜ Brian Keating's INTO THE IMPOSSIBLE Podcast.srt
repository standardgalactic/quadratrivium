1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,560
Alright, we are live on YouTube. Dr. Brian Keating, Dr. Eric Weinstein, how are you my

2
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,400
friend? I miss you very much.

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,400
And I use her. Good to be with you. Is it Cinco de Mayo?

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,280
Yes, Feliz Cinco de Mayo. It always comes on the 5th of May, every freaking year. It's

5
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,280
like clockwork.

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,080
No, I've decided to celebrate and be festive.

7
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,800
You've got five glasses of tequila like me?

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:35,520
No, I've got the Mexican hat potential on the bottom of my mug.

9
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:42,800
Well played, sir. Buenos dias to you, my friend. Well, we're going to get in right off the bat.

10
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,680
We're going to talk about the most exciting subjects in your universe. My audience has

11
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:55,320
missed you as much as I have. And we want to make sure that we kind of give the people

12
00:00:55,400 --> 00:01:00,000
what they're interested in. And that today involves a whole host of issues. We're going

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,920
to talk about aliens and a possible new solution to the Fermi Paradox. We're going to talk

14
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:12,920
about your new and ever-evolving and a good way theories and feelings about cryptocurrencies,

15
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:19,120
inflation, and so forth. And then we're going to talk about some less controversial subjects

16
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:24,760
like abortion, Supreme Court leaks, and wherever the day takes it.

17
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,760
How exciting.

18
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:35,960
Yes, and I was pleased to see recently a man by the name of Musk has kind of taken a new

19
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:42,800
stance for which he's taking extreme attacks and hostility. And I wondered, Eric, you know,

20
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:47,440
if he might have a little bit of buyer's remorse right now. Do you feel like this prize, you

21
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,160
know, everyone's always the richest man in the world. That's true. He has five times this

22
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:57,120
amount. That's true. But, you know, if I, if I, you know, took away your family car, you

23
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,960
would feel it, you know, I would feel it. And so I feel like this is a tremendous amount

24
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,480
of money. And I want to take you back to we started pandemic podcasting together two years

25
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:11,560
ago, exactly. So, you know, congratulations on our anniversary. But in the in between, there

26
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,960
was this thing called Clubhouse. I don't know if you remember this thing called Clubhouse. And

27
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:19,000
that was the hottest ticket in the world. Everybody wanted it and get on it. I haven't

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
used it in months. I don't know about you. Like I said, I don't know, you might be on

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
there, but I'm not on there. Do you think he might be having buyer's remorse? He think

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,320
he might look back and say this was the clubhouse of 2022. Eventually, and I shouldn't have given

31
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:35,400
up a quarter of my network.

32
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:43,040
If there is buyer's remorse, my guess is that it hasn't set in yet. Because I believe that

33
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:50,440
there's a lot of low hanging fruit to improve Twitter. And, you know, Elon, I don't know

34
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:58,280
Elon at all. I know tons of people who know him. My impression of him from afar is very

35
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:05,400
confused. He does seem to be in many ways the world's most forward thinking person. At

36
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:11,080
least at the level of, you know, forward thinking, what can we what can we actually do? So I'm

37
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,520
pretty impressed with him intellectually as a public intellectual. Then, you know, then

38
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:21,920
there are layers. Then there's the idea that he has to be chaotic. So he is very Trump-like

39
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,840
in many ways in terms of how he uses Twitter and how he attempts not to be constrained.

40
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:34,320
Because there are going to be SEC rules and lots of lawyers and PR people telling you

41
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,840
can't say this, you can't do that. And he's decided that he wants to be free. And so there's

42
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,080
this paradox, sort of a laugh or curve, when you have no money and when you have lots of

43
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:48,240
money, you tend to be in a weird way less free than people with intermediate levels. And so in

44
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:55,200
a strange way, I sort of see him as a very rich person, choosing to put a lot of his wealth at

45
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:01,280
risk so that he can be free. And that too is very forward thinking. Now, what I know about

46
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:08,080
Twitter is that current Twitter has all sorts of obviously soluble problems in terms of you can

47
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:15,160
just fire a bunch of people and you can make rules about algorithmic transparency and the

48
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:21,440
like. And then when you get to the end of plucking all the low-hanging fruit, then you've got the

49
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:29,720
problem of the underlying technology allows any person to post something instantly. And you

50
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:35,160
know, what we've seen is we've seen first-person shooters looking like they come out of a video

51
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:42,880
game in the Christchurch Mosque Massacre that was, I think, streamed live on Facebook. So the

52
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:50,440
problem is us. It's not Twitter. It's not the technology. It's the technology hooked up. Lots

53
00:04:50,440 --> 00:05:00,400
of people, many of whom have mental health issues, many of whom are incredibly chaotic, talking

54
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:05,560
to each other without common background, without an ability to, you know, to know who's going to

55
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:14,560
post what when. So in that world, I don't think there's a solution. So, you know, the great

56
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:23,960
danger is that he's bought something and he's got the first 17 fixes lined up. And I don't think

57
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:28,240
the problem is going to occur then. I think the problem is going to occur once you fixed all of

58
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:34,800
those things. What are you left with? And you know, one of the things he's signaled, Brian, is that

59
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:43,200
he believes that removing anonymity will be a large portion of the solution. And I do think it

60
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:51,440
will do a lot to solve the problems. But there's a hard core of people who are happy to be known,

61
00:05:52,440 --> 00:06:00,080
who are incredibly abusive, and think it's funny. And then there's a very large market for abuse. And

62
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:06,080
I think people haven't really realized that abuse tends to be one of the most important products

63
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:12,440
that the internet knows how to distribute. And because you can't sign up for abuse, you can't

64
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:17,200
say, hey, I want to see who's abusing who today. I'm feeling like I should abuse somebody else. I'm

65
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:24,440
not feeling so good about myself. When you do that, you realize you can't be honest, that you're

66
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:29,080
really up for going to the Coliseum to see people get hurt. You're really starting to say, oh, no,

67
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:36,480
no, no. I'm here for the comedy. It's just comedy. It's just fun. It's just laughs. Or I think this

68
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:43,120
makes the world a better place. I'm calling people out who are ghoulish and horrible. Well, no,

69
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:49,200
you're really just up for abuse. And you don't have many ideas and your life is empty. And that's

70
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:56,240
what you're doing. Okay, that problem of all sorts of people selling this one product that has an

71
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:04,040
enormous audience for it is going to plague Twitter. So I think that there is buyer's remorse. But I

72
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:10,200
think Elon can go make more money. What he's trying to do is he's trying to say, we have to have some

73
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:17,920
property that isn't in control under the, how do I say this? You have to have some major property

74
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:28,960
that isn't under the control of whatever this wrong woke thing is. And, you know, you have Fox,

75
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:43,440
you have, I don't know, Newsmax, but these are not major, you know, even the blaze or the daily wire

76
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:52,000
or daily collar, any of these things, I think, they're not like MSNBC, New York Times, NPR, and the

77
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:01,240
fact that all of these sort of formally, formally, respectable properties gone completely insane,

78
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:11,080
haven't broken rank, buying one, and saying, hey, we're not going to change the logo, and we're not

79
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:17,840
going to change the mast, the mast head completely. But what we are going to do is we are going to

80
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:24,360
stop making it possible to be ridiculous in this coordinated assault on reality. Now, that's why

81
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:33,600
everybody on the, it's not the left, Brian, it's like the, it's some sort of a partnership between

82
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:42,760
the establishment left and their revolutionary army that they deploy to try to undo everything that

83
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,640
gets in the, in the path of what I would call the rent seeking elite who are in control of the

84
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:54,840
Democratic Party. That, that thing, he's taking that on. And I think you have to look at it. He's

85
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:59,920
not taking it on necessarily from being a conservative. He's taking it on from saying, I

86
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,360
can't live under these people one second longer.

87
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:09,800
Yeah. And, you know, I think, looking back at, you know, the history of these platforms, I mean, we

88
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:15,920
see Facebook kind of falling out of favor. And we saw the massive contributions in the previous

89
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:22,200
election, election by Zuckerberg, which didn't curry him any favor with the people that obviously he

90
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,880
was advocating for. So I wonder, you know, in this, and I wonder if you saw any of the interviews

91
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:33,440
that Zuckerberg's been on this, you know, kind of world tour lately on Lex's show and on another

92
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:40,960
podcast, Tim Ferriss. And no one's really asking him, you know, these really tough questions. So I

93
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:46,360
wonder, you know, is it, is it really true that we look to these, we look to these people as if

94
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:52,240
they're so lucky to have the resources to buy this? It seems to me like a nightmare hellscape to

95
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,000
wake up in the morning and have a New York Times hit piece like Elon faces today with his South

96
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,320
African childhood brought into play as if he had choices to where he was born.

97
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,440
Geez.

98
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:09,160
I just, why don't you just call everything white supremacist? You know, just just get it over

99
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,720
with everybody's a Nazi. Everybody's always why they just waste our time because the New York

100
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:21,640
Times used to be an important newspaper and, and still capable of doing things. We all have to

101
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:29,360
have a discussion framed by them. And my feeling is, okay, let's just take some random person, you

102
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,640
know, let's take just give me a generic Republican.

103
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,080
Marco Rubio.

104
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:44,560
Okay, Marco Rubio. Is there any truth to the fact that he was connected to the Cuban Cuban mafia?

105
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:52,040
Okay, now we're going to discuss Marco Rubio being connected to the Cuban mafia for no reason other

106
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:57,560
than the fact that somebody was able to put that question in a sentence at the top of an article.

107
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:05,640
So my feeling is we can also, why does Marco Rubio seemingly target America's children? Oh, is he

108
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,920
targeting America's children? Like we just changed from the Cuban mafia to some different story.

109
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:19,880
I think we've got to just stop, start with the idea of shut up. Like, you know, if you don't have

110
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,520
much hush,

111
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,800
that's where I feel like, you know, this, this takeover of Twitter, he took over something, which is

112
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:33,280
built by people that had an ideological bent against him and have a very clear perspective on what

113
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:38,400
they want to promote and what they don't want to promote and, and highlight versus not. And I feel

114
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:43,840
like, again, I feel like it's like a booby prize. I do feel like at some point, even I or you, you

115
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:49,720
know, would wake up and just say, you know, like, there's so much richness in the world. Like, who

116
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,760
cares to have these battles with people that only get points, the more polarized that they speak, the

117
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,880
more they try to punch up and take down Eric Weinstein, I get, I get like those Dungeons, remember

118
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,960
the Dungeons and Dragons, you know, hit points. If I take Eric's car, you know, I get your hit

119
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:08,560
points. Well, you've got 690,000 people that fall. Oh, I've only got two. Who gives a fricking

120
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:14,760
crap? You know, I mean, all these people do remarkably well and without it. And I feel like he's

121
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:20,160
catering to this tribe of maybe 100,000 semi woke, you know, if you want to call it that,

122
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:25,240
journalists, people in the Beltway and the corridor in the Northeast and then the West Coast. And why

123
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,720
do you want to spend so much of your money? I mean, again, it's a fifth Brian, Brian, I don't know

124
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:35,160
what you're asking about. The key issue is we've got to buy one of these things. There has to be a

125
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:40,800
university that's actually a university, a news service that's actually a news service, a place, a

126
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:47,080
public square that's a public square. Like, we've lost everything, essentially. And then there's

127
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:52,920
these false equivalent. Oh, no, no, no, Fox. It's like, look, Fox, I still treat as right wing

128
00:12:52,920 --> 00:13:02,160
propaganda. The major issue is that left leaning properties went insane, as opposed to merely

129
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:09,800
biased. And, you know, like, there's one of these things with, Hey, remember, we told you that

130
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:14,960
Ivermectin was horse dewormer that you shouldn't take it? Well, it turns out that if we lose Roe

131
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:24,160
V. Wade, a horse ulcer medication can be used to induce off label of spontaneous abortions in

132
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:30,640
humans. So just go to your vet, you're covered. And I'm thinking, Okay, I really appreciate that.

133
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:35,480
What you're really doing is telling me that you have the right to contradict yourselves and the

134
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:41,560
rest of us are all hypocrites for simply trying to get through a day, but you have an absolute right

135
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:49,320
to say whatever you want, whenever you want. That it's a game. And I have to admit, I have caught

136
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:54,400
people chuckling, like, Hey, did you see what I just put out today? That'll bend their minds because

137
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:59,320
it contradicts what I said three weeks ago. You're just thinking, Okay, I get it. Everybody's

138
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:04,840
joyriding. Right. Yeah, right. You get those, I get those adrenaline bumps. And then speaking of

139
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:09,240
that, you know, this, this thing, I don't know if the deal is actually done or what it is. But in

140
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,880
obviously a lot of it was leaked ahead of time and so forth. And, and you have this like, it's

141
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:18,520
like the fifth estate now. So, so you have the fourth estate, which is media. And then there's

142
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:24,280
like this, this leakage class, you know, the people beyond the, beyond the curtain that will

143
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:29,240
leak the story that eventually does get pipeline directly into the mainstream veins of, of the

144
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:33,680
fourth estate of journalism. And what do you make of this? I mean, this people are celebrating as

145
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,960
heroes. This leak, you know, to the, to the, from the Supreme Court decision, which, as I

146
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:43,440
understand it, could put people's lives in danger, right? I don't want to be too specific. But this,

147
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:49,440
this, this thing has not set a law yet. And regardless of how you feel about it, and I can

148
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,400
hear opinions on both sides. Before I actually, before I get to that, Eric, about two years ago

149
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:59,280
on the portal, you did this wonderful kind of verbal essay, and everybody's asking when the

150
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:04,320
portal is going to come back. I hope it'll be soon. No questions asked about that today. But

151
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:10,000
you did a, you did a wonderful verbal essay in which you talked about the trouble with ambiguity.

152
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,760
And you talked about superpositions and how inharmonious they are for the human mind. And the

153
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:20,720
human mind hates ambiguity and loves resolution, even if the resolution's wrong. And you talked

154
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,440
about abortion, you talked about gun control. I wonder, could you recapitulate that discussion?

155
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:31,120
It was in the context of, you know, kind of a Schrodinger state of a baby being real versus

156
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,000
not. Have you changed your opinions? And can you first recap? Can you recount that, that,

157
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,120
that wonderful kind of analogy that you used? Well, yeah, of course, I should listen to the

158
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,360
portal and find out what I, what I said or thought. You know, my usual,

159
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,200
just bring your own words on you. You remember that Charles Barkley said he was, he was taken

160
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:56,880
out of context in his own autobiography. So we're not in that company. Well, you know, the famous

161
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,240
description of one of my favorite classical music pieces, St. Saint-San second piano concerto,

162
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:10,320
is that it begins with Bach and ends with often Bach. And conception, you know, it begins

163
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:15,440
when you're talking about terminating a pregnancy, it sort of begins with

164
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:22,560
spermicide and ends in infanticide. And anything that has that property of being on a continuum

165
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:28,720
that connects something incredibly trivial to something unthinkable, but naturally, you know,

166
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:35,040
through the intermediate value theorem, there's got to be some point where that thing becomes

167
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:44,400
a meaningful life. And the political expediency has said, we're going to turn this into an

168
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:50,640
intellectual football, right? And so one side is going to pretend that something is a baby,

169
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:59,280
the instant the sperm nudge is close to the egg. And somebody else is going to pretend that it's

170
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:08,320
just the mother's body four seconds before delivery. Okay, well, there's a black hole

171
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:13,040
that I don't want to get into, because what they're really saying is we know that we've

172
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:19,120
got to make this wrong statement in order to get where we need to go. And if you won't make the

173
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:25,360
wrong statement with us, you're Hitler. It's like, okay, so add Hitler to white supremacists.

174
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:31,280
It's just, look, Brian, this is all so dumb. It's so innervating. I mean, the real issue is we

175
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:37,440
should go back to reading Griswold, you know, before row, where we get the penumbra argument.

176
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,840
I think it's advanced by William O. Douglas in the Warren Court. And we should ask ourselves,

177
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,640
how sophisticated is that decision? And then, you know, the issue with row,

178
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:54,000
of course, is that for its time, there was no plan B. Back in that day, the world was a very

179
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,640
different place. You know, there are arguments in all different directions. I don't want to get

180
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:06,960
into any of that, because the issue, you know, suffice it to say, I behave pretty much as a

181
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:12,640
pro-choice person early on in the pregnancy. And I've, you know, protested in the streets

182
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:20,960
in order to make sure that women have safe legal access to disposing of their pregnancies early

183
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:30,480
on. And I'm pretty pro-baby's rights right before, you know, somebody's about to give birth. And

184
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:37,200
they can't go to anybody's party. Yeah, I mean, I remember my dad of a blessed memory. He used

185
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:43,840
to joke, you know, on my 33rd birthday, he said, I believe in abortion up until the 99th trimester.

186
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:50,400
And, you know, but now it's not a joke. I mean, you have people that are effectively saying,

187
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,360
you know, such things as, you know, a pregnant person, of course, we have to be respectful.

188
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,920
It's amazing how we went from we can't define what a woman is with regard to the Supreme Court.

189
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:09,360
The media stuff. I value your time and my time. And we can get into like, trans, what are they

190
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:15,600
thinking? Or do you know what someone's always been accused of next? And my feeling is, this is my

191
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:20,640
only time on this planet. And I have, you know, an esteemed physicist colleague, a worldly guy.

192
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:27,280
I don't want to talk about any of the ridiculously stupid stuff that everybody wants us to talk about.

193
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,840
All right. Well, thanks for joining the Into the Impossible podcast.

194
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,840
It's been a pleasure. And please like comment and subscribe.

195
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:42,720
Women get pregnant and give birth. And we should call some number of biological men, women, I think,

196
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:48,880
because there is a programming issue, but this has gotten out of hand. And I'm not going to sort

197
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,120
it out with you on this particular program. And we haven't lost our mind. And I'm not going to throw

198
00:19:53,120 --> 00:20:04,960
biology out the window because, you know, Renee Richards is upset. We have to be compassionate

199
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:11,760
and deal with everybody in our society. We should be kind. And we can't lose our minds at the same

200
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:17,600
time. And we failed. And we failed to have these discussions. We failed to talk about the reality

201
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,560
of pregnancy. We won't sit down with Carnegie Stages and embryonic development and say,

202
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:27,840
when does the neural tube and the neural crest form? And what is the richness of neural activity

203
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:33,920
and all these kinds of things that matter to me? Instead, we're going to try to talk to each other.

204
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,920
Pro-life, no, pro-choice, no, pro-life. Let's let somebody else do it.

205
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,640
All right. Well, let's pivot to another existential crisis.

206
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,280
Well, no, no. I'm going to get to the leak.

207
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,000
All right. Yes. I want to talk about the leak. Okay. Let's go back to that. Yeah.

208
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:55,920
I think it's important. I just had a conversation with somebody I've known very long time as a

209
00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:02,080
lawyer last night. And the lawyer said, you know, it's wrong to leak. And I probably would have

210
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:09,520
considered it. And I said, why? Oh, because I think it's so important that women have

211
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,600
access to reproductive rights that even the unthinkable should be done.

212
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:28,240
Okay. I appreciated the candor. I think that's insane. I mean, I think that what's really

213
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:36,400
becoming very clear is that very few of us trust democracy, trust the court, trust our scientists.

214
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:46,320
The level of loss of trust has led to a large number of us unwilling to carry the culture

215
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:52,080
of the United States that animates the Constitution and its other governing document.

216
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:59,040
I think this is something I don't know how to communicate. If you don't carry the culture

217
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:03,520
of the United States, which is that you're willing to believe in a fiction that nine

218
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:10,320
druids can discern the meaning of the Constitution and legal conflict, which is, I'm going to say it

219
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:19,680
right here. It's a fiction. But I agree to that fiction. I agree to the fiction that a majority

220
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:25,440
of the electoral college or one day maybe the electorate has the wisdom, the best wisdom available

221
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:32,240
to choose the president, blah, blah, blah. I think many of us have decided that they don't feel,

222
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:37,520
we don't feel like carrying the culture. And without the culture, it's a piece of parchment

223
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:43,280
with ink. There's nothing more. If you can't animate the document, if you're unwilling

224
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:48,880
to pretend to believe in the things that are necessary to keep the experiment running, because

225
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:55,040
it's like, no, with Merrick Garland, that's out the window. No, with Bork. It's ridiculous. No,

226
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:59,280
no, no, you don't understand. The activism on the Warren court destroyed the... Okay. Look,

227
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,280
I know all of the right-wing complaints about the left and the judiciary, and I know all of the

228
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:12,080
complaints in reverse. And there's two separate stories. And I'm like, I feel like I'm the middle

229
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,640
child. It's like, you idiots are going to lose us everything. Oh, you want to pack the court? Oh,

230
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:23,120
you want to do this? Okay. No fellow buster. Right. We're not going to survive this, you morons.

231
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:28,960
And, you know, my feeling about this is my desire to watch Joe Biden, Donald Trump,

232
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:37,120
all of these, these people are not going to be around for that long. My kids have a lot of

233
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:44,480
runtime left. I just worry that what we haven't realized is that a giant chunk of both parties

234
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,200
have gone revolutionary. They don't believe in the country.

235
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:54,800
How does that bode for the remainder of the union of these states then?

236
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:05,520
I think we don't realize what we're doing. You know, I have this memory of being on a school bus

237
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:13,920
when I was a little kid and figuring out that if I could get the kids to sway back and forth

238
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:22,480
in unison, we could actually have a large effect in aggregate. And we started swaying the bus,

239
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:27,760
and the bus was really like rocking at some incredible level, just from all of these kids

240
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,040
going back and forth. And once they figured out that this was real, they got more and more

241
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:38,000
enthusiastic. And it felt like we were pretty close to being in danger of actually getting the

242
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:45,280
bus to do something it wasn't supposed to do. Now, I feel like that's what we're doing,

243
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:49,520
is that we have this idea that the bus represents like adulthood. There's nothing you can do to

244
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:55,280
take down the United States of America. It's some super stable superpower. You can mouth off. It's

245
00:24:55,280 --> 00:25:01,840
not true. We are now in danger of disassembling this beautiful experiment because we're bored.

246
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:08,160
And we're like mischievous, and we want to have fun. So maybe we'll riot the streets this summer.

247
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:14,080
Summer is coming up. There's always a good idea to have mostly peaceful gatherings, and we can

248
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,840
call each other names and bring some guns, and then we can discuss who shot whom.

249
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:28,560
I think you've got more kids than I can remember. You probably have the same

250
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:32,480
number as the last time we spoke, but I'm not even positive of that. No abortions.

251
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:41,120
In Maurice Sendix, where the wild things are, he says, let the wild rumpus start.

252
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:55,040
Yeah. I think that's the wild rumpus. Yeah, exactly. Since we talked last in late December,

253
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:03,520
we did record about a month ago. We may release that at some point. But we've had this existential

254
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:13,440
crisis looming in Eastern Europe. And I wonder if we can kind of think about that. That rumpus

255
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,680
governed by the same clan of people you just talked about with the addition of somebody who

256
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:23,600
brings the average age of the discussants down slightly closer to 70, the Vladimir Putin,

257
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:30,320
who I understand he's not well. I believe he is undergoing some surgery, so I don't know if

258
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:38,080
people are going to send thoughts and prayers to that particular individual. But now things are

259
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,800
getting serious. And I remember not too long ago, you advocated for something, and I was like,

260
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:49,680
he can't be serious. My God, he can't be serious. And that was for a demonstration event of the

261
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:57,440
awesomeness of the release of the binding energy between nucleons. And that was a call to

262
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:04,800
a demonstration of the fearful power of the wildest rumpus of all, which is nuclear or

263
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:12,080
thermonuclear weapons. And you advocated for a non-radioactive but still thermonuclear

264
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:19,200
detonation, so to speak, of the kind that we could witness, obviously not on catastrophic

265
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:24,160
scale. But I wonder what was, at first I was shocked. I thought, Eric's being a provocative

266
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:29,200
tour. What's the thinking behind that? What would that do for humanity to see such a thing?

267
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:37,920
You can see for yourself, we've lost our fear of the sun. We can create what the sun does on earth,

268
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,000
and we're not afraid of it anymore.

269
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:52,880
Look, I can't easily talk about Ukraine at the moment, because I am so isolated from the rest

270
00:27:52,880 --> 00:28:02,800
of you all. If I start talking about this, it becomes very clear that we're distracting

271
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:08,240
ourselves with everything else. And so I understand that we've decided to distract ourselves, to not

272
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:15,360
take this seriously, to trifle with Armageddon, and to have fun with it. We've got a handsome Jewish

273
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,440
guy who loves his wife with one of the great lines of all time.

274
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,600
You know what the line is? I need ammunition, not a ride.

275
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:33,600
Right? And so it's like, oh my god, nobody's, nobody's ever done anything that masculine,

276
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:38,080
and I'm kind of excited. It's like, okay, so now we're going to have a planet that is

277
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:44,560
coked up on the testosterone, testosterone of Ukraine's head of state,

278
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:55,680
and we're going to trifle with Armageddon as if this is fun, or okay, or hey, let's redo the

279
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:03,440
early part of the 20th century before we had the nuclear weapon. And my assessment is that

280
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:09,360
it is more likely that you are all sane, and that I am insane because of the odds.

281
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:16,160
But I think it's the reverse. I think when I called for a return to above-ground nuclear testing,

282
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:23,520
I saw that the Cold War wasn't over. And I saw a world of people whose brains have been restructured

283
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:28,560
by their phone. Like, I'll just give you something from Miami. I was in Miami. Was it a wonderful

284
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:34,640
dinner? Very successful guy picked up the tab. But when the topic came up, he said, you know,

285
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:39,120
the thing about all-out nuclear war is I'm not really worried about all-out nuclear war. I'm

286
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:46,880
worried about re-establishing credibility in the markets afterwards. And I thought, got it.

287
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:56,560
But we're not, I'm not in the same conversation. So I think that to be blunt about it, I've gone

288
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:03,200
crazy. And I'm telling you how important above-ground nuclear testing with radiation,

289
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:12,720
you know, a lot of the radiation, the permanent radiation comes from the, I guess, the fission

290
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:19,840
reaction that is turned into the fusion reaction, thanks to the geometry of Teller and Ulam. And

291
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:29,200
I think that it is a question of self-preservation. I think you cannot have this many people completely.

292
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:39,280
I've gone crazy. I believe that we are trifling with Armageddon. And if we get onto this topic,

293
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:45,280
I will just sound like the most unbalanced person you've heard.

294
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:53,040
Well, I don't think so. And here's the reason why. If we look at the writings of our mutual friend,

295
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:59,920
David Kaiser, the Girmenschenhausen Professor at MIT of Science Technology Studies, a good friend,

296
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:05,600
truly a wonderful individual, he wrote a book about the quantum legacy, I think it's called.

297
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:11,280
And it's about kind of twin nuclei in your language, but more not the biological nuclei,

298
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:18,400
but sort of the contemporaneous development of nuclear weapons of space travel and of the

299
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:24,000
interest in aliens and events like Roswell and so forth, that that wasn't coincidental, that they

300
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:30,720
were all sort of synergistically related, and it wasn't purely serendipitous. And his claim,

301
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:39,120
I think is now being taken up as one of the possible explanations of Fermi's Paradox.

302
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:43,840
So I'm going to ask you first to define Fermi's Paradox, and then I'm going to read this paper,

303
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:48,080
which is behind a paywall, but I'm going to give value to my audience. So on this channel,

304
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:54,720
we do nothing if not give value. And this is going to be a website, which you will thank me for in

305
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,760
your dreams, and it gets you over paywalls. I will reveal that in just a minute. So stay

306
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:04,000
tuned for that. That's what we call foreshadowing in the business area. First of all, what is the

307
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:11,040
Fermi Paradox? Is it significant? Does it rise to the level of the Twin Paradox, of the Xenos

308
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:17,040
Paradox, or is it merely a stepping stone into a bigger series of questions? Fermi Paradox, please.

309
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:22,160
Well, I would rather hear it from an astrophysicist than...

310
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:27,280
Fine. There happens to be one right here. So Fermi did the calculation even back in the 50s of how

311
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:34,080
many stars there were, how likely it was to have life in other planets, sort of precursor to what's

312
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:39,040
called the Drake equation, and he came up with this estimate based on the very large number of stars

313
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:44,000
known in the Milky Way galaxy, even at that point, not taking into account galaxies outside of the

314
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:50,880
Milky Way. And he said the overwhelming odds are that there are other civilizations, other aliens,

315
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:56,640
and so he asked one of these questions after the calculations that he was famous for, the so-called

316
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:02,800
Fermi calculations. He said, where are they? If the odds are, there's tremendous numbers of these

317
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:08,080
civilizations of advanced extraterrestrial technology, capable species, not slime mold.

318
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:14,720
Oh, by the way, Eric, I wanted to ask this of my friends on Twitter, but I'm too scared to ask

319
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:20,160
it, so I'll ask it of you. If we found an embryo, like a human fetus, let's say it's a three-month

320
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:25,840
development gestation, and it's on the planet, you know, Procyon B, you know, Trappist 1,

321
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:32,240
what do you think the community of astronomers would do? I mean, would they say, ah, it's nothing,

322
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:38,320
you know, let's abort it? I mean, is that an interesting litmus test to you of how we would

323
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,640
react if we saw a fetus? Whatever age you want to say, 10 days, 20 days, it has a heartbeat,

324
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:47,920
it's just sitting there on some planet in some exosolar planet. Is that relevant to the conversation

325
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:56,400
of abortion at all? I don't even know. It's like a Boltzmann brain, but it's a Boltzmann fetus.

326
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:04,880
Boltzmann fetus. Okay. Whatever you're smoking, you've not sent me any of it. I did see an enormous

327
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:11,520
mushroom the other day on your channel, and this is an exciting new direction for middle-aged.

328
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:19,520
Never lick the mushroom. Never lick the mushroom. Okay. Look, we seem to be very afraid to believe,

329
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:30,240
and, you know, let me just get over the hump. I don't believe we're the only life in the universe.

330
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:38,880
I don't know how common or how rare it is. I don't know whether or not there are ways of

331
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:45,840
evading. I don't know whether Einstein's restrictions passed through to all successor theories to

332
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:53,040
relativity. You know, Einstein may have done something to Newton, but he didn't do everything

333
00:34:53,040 --> 00:35:02,640
to Newton's conservation law, if you know properly understood. So we don't know what the source of

334
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:09,200
our apparent aloneness is, but apparent may be doing a fair amount of heavy lifting,

335
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:16,880
and what I've offered up is the Fermi Paradox that I know. The only Fermi Paradox that I know

336
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:23,920
is the one on North Sentinel Island in the Andaman chain, because the islanders are effectively

337
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:29,040
Indians, but they don't know that they're Indians. They may not even know that India exists or that

338
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:37,360
India claims North Sentinel Island or that it won't let anyone land there. And my other claim

339
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:48,400
is that I believe that a good chunk of humanity has stumbled into a very appealing wrong idea.

340
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:54,240
So first I want to talk about the appeal of the wrong idea. The wrong idea is the more we find

341
00:35:54,320 --> 00:36:00,160
out, the more we realize how little we understand. There's something like really comforting about

342
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:08,000
this. And imagine that you apply this generally. The longer I'm in love, the more I realize how

343
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,280
little I understand about the human heart. Oh, that's beautiful. But then you apply it to real

344
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:20,640
things. The longer I study continental exploration, the more I realize that every new land mass

345
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:26,000
we find on Earth is just an indication of how many land masses we have yet to find.

346
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:32,160
That's like the dumbest thing you could possibly say, but it has the same basic feeling. Well,

347
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:40,160
I think we're almost at the end. I think we are afraid to say something which has always been

348
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:46,160
false in the past. Now, the thing is, we're almost at the end of the rules of physics.

349
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:54,080
When somebody says that, everyone says, yeah, Lord Kelvin said that they thought that that was true

350
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:58,320
when they had the proton and the electron. And then they found the neutron. Okay. Well,

351
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:04,560
yes. And it was always true that powered human flight was never going to happen because it had

352
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:09,840
never happened until it happened. And it was the same thing. You know, there's this land mass off

353
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:15,680
of Siberia that I think was discovered in the 20th century, which is the last major land mass to be

354
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:24,640
found. Nobody's worried about the idea that there are uncharted desert isles on Earth because we

355
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:30,720
have the satellite there. We're about at the end of physics, I think. Now, that could be wrong.

356
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:36,800
The easiest way for it to be wrong is that we would be at the end of this chapter,

357
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,240
but it would be a book with many chapters and you have to finish this chapter to know that there

358
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:47,280
are chapters to follow. Okay. What if for the moment, I take the contrarian position and say,

359
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:53,120
no, no, no, I think this is about to wrap up. And the really weird thing is that it's taken

360
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:05,040
from 1945 until the present for us to get close. That's a the blink of an eye in cosmic time.

361
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:10,160
But my belief is, is that if anything is monitoring us, and if I'm not wrong,

362
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:18,080
right before you have the full power of the laws of physics, you let off a nuke.

363
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:24,160
And then you go from fission to fusion. And so the concern that I have is, first of all,

364
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:30,080
that the Fermi paradox on North Sentinel Island is the same as the Fermi paradox we have here on

365
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:35,200
Earth, where we are in the North Sentinelese, and we're trying to guess that India exists.

366
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:42,400
So my question to you is, first of all, is there some sort of a thing that doesn't want us

367
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:49,680
contacted that is shielding us the way India shields North Sentinel Island? And is it the case

368
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:54,640
that whatever it is, is, you know, while we think, oh, well, geez, Sam Harris, my friend, said,

369
00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:01,600
whoever is out there must be, you know, millions of years and more advanced. They would view us as

370
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:16,160
aphids, nonsense. There is probably a level of sophistication where it kind of taps out.

371
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:21,360
And, you know, you can build bigger and bigger computers, but you're not going to discover

372
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:25,360
more land masses on Earth, and I don't know that you're going to discover more laws of physics.

373
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:32,160
I'm concerned, quite honestly, that we've lost our fear of the cosmos, just the way we've lost

374
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:37,360
our fear of nukes. We've become relatively certain that nothing ever happens here, that we won't be

375
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:46,000
visited, that there's nothing else other than us. And I'm worried that what we did is we alerted

376
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,720
whatever is out there, hey, we're just about at the end, and we haven't worked out our stuff,

377
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:55,120
and we're going to be able to get off this rock if you are able to get off this rock.

378
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:01,280
I mean, to come visit this rock, rather. So if things can visit us, we can leave.

379
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,320
Now, it may be that all the planets are, you know, rushing away from each other

380
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:13,840
because of the expansion of the metric of space-like splices in the universe. But

381
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:24,960
if the next theory has the power to get us really far, really easily, and far might be,

382
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:33,600
in many dimensions, not all of them spatial, I would be very worried that whatever is watching us

383
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,440
knows how close we are.

384
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:43,280
So, I mean, we have to admit the mastodon in the room is that we have no evidence.

385
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:50,160
There's life elsewhere. I stole that from Sir Roger Penrose. And we hear this, Lee Cronin,

386
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:57,200
and my friend, Sarah Walker, they were just on Lex, and they're talking very, very specifically

387
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:01,360
about the traits and characteristics of these aliens, and what they're going to be like,

388
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:05,120
and how you can calculate exactly how much structure went into them, and how you could

389
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:10,800
detect them, and it's all very interesting, and it's rooted in sound, chemical, and physical

390
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:17,440
reasoning. But there's still this huge, you know, lacuna, which is that there's zero evidence. And

391
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:22,480
in fact, I want to try, I want to try something out on you, an argument that I have, which will

392
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:29,440
sound dirty, but it's not, and you know it's not. And it's called panspermia, panspermia, okay.

393
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:35,760
Now, it sounds dirty, but it involves the exchange of material between planets in our solar system

394
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:41,440
and other solar systems, perhaps. And you talked to Avi Loeb, our mutual friend,

395
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:49,680
not too long ago in Miami also, while he was down there with you. And he talked about the

396
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:56,000
almost, you know, definite admission by the U.S. government that an extraterrestrial meteorite

397
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:02,000
had landed from another solar system in the somewhere in the ocean on Earth. And that was

398
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,320
obtained. And I love Avi. I'm, you know, like you, you know, kind of helping him out on his

399
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:13,840
Project LAO. So we're both, you know, kind of Avi maximalists to use mixed metaphors. But Avi,

400
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,800
you know, claims this is there, and it's based on trajectory data, highly controversial people,

401
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:24,640
you know, can't reproduce it. But at any rate, if true, highlights the fact that materials,

402
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:29,600
such as this meteorite, I've given you several of these, and you tried to snort one once.

403
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:35,200
Anyway, these are meteorites. They come from Argentina. They're delivered by gravity and the

404
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:43,280
U.S. Postal Service. They're hard iron, silicon, and cobalt. They're highly magnetic. And they came,

405
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,960
and they smashed into Earth. Now, there are meteorites that I will never give to you,

406
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:51,280
because they cost as much as my first, you know, two cars put together. I have,

407
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:56,800
and it came from the planet Mars. So I have a chunk of Mars in my, in my lab. And that

408
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:02,880
chunk of Mars was proven by gas chromatography and other tools to originate from Mars. Okay.

409
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:07,440
Now, how did it get here? Same way. Blasted off of Mars by a Martian meteorite,

410
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,200
kicked around the solar system for a few million years, landed on Earth in Northwest Africa.

411
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:18,320
Now, the same process happens in reverse. Life carrying molecules could be embedded on rocks,

412
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:22,400
and, you know, a chunk of a whale gets kicked out into space, and then eventually lands on Mars,

413
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,240
right? But we have no evidence of that. We have no evidence of that happening

414
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:30,160
over billions of years. Now, this could, this could, this has been happening as long as life

415
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:34,960
has been on Earth, which Lee and others tell me is four billion years. So you have four billion

416
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:41,120
years of opportunity to have panspermic transfers of life that we know exist on Earth,

417
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:44,800
going to other parts of our solar system. And there's zero evidence, not, you know,

418
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:49,840
I'm not asking for terraformed, you know, plateaus on Venus, just saying there's no evidence. Now,

419
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:55,760
absence of evidence isn't proof of absence, but shouldn't, at some point, people start to take

420
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:03,360
the lack of, you know, any sort of data or what have you as troubling in a Bayesian sense, that

421
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:09,520
you can't put a prior that is so certain, close to 100% Lee tells me, that he believes aliens are

422
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:13,520
inevitable, and you sound like you believe it as well. So, I want to ask you, what level,

423
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:17,840
what would it take you to believe that aliens don't exist? Alien life, forget about intelligent,

424
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:22,640
just life. Anywhere in the universe? Anywhere else in the universe. What would, I mean, what would

425
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:26,720
I have to ask? What piece of evidence would you have to have to know that's impossible,

426
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,680
that, you know, it's impossible for life to be elsewhere than Earth?

427
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:36,880
Impossible? Vanishingly, vanishingly small. In other words, the people that say it's guaranteed,

428
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:43,120
like Avi and Lee, and maybe you, I don't know, say it's all but guaranteed, the Fermi, you know,

429
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:49,280
kind of suggestion, it's all but guaranteed. So, what series of piece of evidence would decrease

430
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:54,800
that to as close to zero as you could imagine? You can't rule it out, obviously. Oh, you're

431
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:59,760
going to hate this answer. We would get to the next level in physics. We would find out that it

432
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:04,880
does give us the ability to buzz the cosmos. We would send out an enormous number of probes,

433
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:13,040
and we would change our, we would tutor our Bayesian prior by exploring all of the

434
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:20,480
most Earth-like exoplanets we could find, which are now cheap to visit because of new discoveries

435
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:25,920
that were not available to us when we were stuck with Einstein's effective theory,

436
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:34,400
or quantum field theory. That is what it would take. Right now, I can't see almost anything.

437
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,960
Really? I mean, I can't get you beyond sea, but I can get you to see, I can get you the speed of

438
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:44,320
light, right? We can have a discussion about the simulation hypothesis and that we can have avatars

439
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:49,040
cruising about the universe. We don't see any evidence of that either, in contrast to my guest,

440
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:55,040
David Shalmer's claim. So, I mean, we could travel at the speed of light. Isn't that good enough?

441
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:01,040
Do we really have to go beyond the speed of light before you believe that they don't exist?

442
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:07,280
You know, Brent, I don't know how to think about this. There's a suite of problems that is different

443
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:12,400
than any problem we've ever solved in science. One of them would be the beginning, how did life

444
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,800
begin? That would be an example of the class of problems I want to talk about, or another one of

445
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:25,600
these would be, how do you get consciousness to evolve from the material world? Another of these

446
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:33,920
would be contact or the ability to prove where did the origin of the universe, what is the origin

447
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:42,640
of the universe? What is behind the surface of last scattering? Why do men and women take so much

448
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:48,560
such different times when going to the restroom? You know, there are various things.

449
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:53,680
What? There's something man is not meant to know, literally. Exactly. That's what I was trying to say

450
00:46:53,680 --> 00:47:03,840
with the surface of last scattering. I believe that we haven't solved any of these problems ever.

451
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:12,160
The hardest things that we know how to do, look, the hardest thing that I know is quantum field

452
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:29,840
theory. Quantum field theory is unbelievably difficult to learn, and it has gotten harder

453
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:37,600
and easier. Now, I have the entire standard model in stylized form that animates.

454
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:45,360
This is the classical input that when quantized gives us our understanding of the world, and it's

455
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:52,960
incredibly simple. The idea that this fits on a mug, and you and I can go line by line symbol

456
00:47:52,960 --> 00:48:02,560
by symbol and say what everything is. Grand drinkification. We have only solved problems

457
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:06,800
in the shallow end of science. We have never solved a problem outside of the shallow end of

458
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:15,440
science. When people start to talk about free will, I just think, wow, you've gone from wearing floaties

459
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:23,360
in the shallow end with your parents holding you up to wanting to surf shark infested waters

460
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:31,840
off the coast of Portugal with monster waves and sharp rocks. Who knows what? It's a totally

461
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:40,000
different level of science to figure out life's origin or consciousness or the beginning of the

462
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:46,960
universe. We haven't gotten to any of these yet. I think what we're very good at is we're very good

463
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:56,960
at extremely hard, simple problems. We're all interested in these questions, but my interest

464
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:03,680
isn't in the recreational version of these. I know that if you and I did nothing else other than

465
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:10,400
talk about free will for a year, we would get nowhere. The conversation would be recreation.

466
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:18,000
I think we could have many different possible conversations. None of them will get anywhere.

467
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:24,240
So I'm always curious as to why people say, I believe in free will. I don't. Okay, so you're

468
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:31,280
going to do that thing. We need to do things that might work. And the things that might work have to

469
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:39,200
do with like my friend Rima Khan is about to have her SETI meeting in San Francisco. We can listen

470
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:43,920
for things. We can try to work on the laws of physics. I cannot believe we are still focused on

471
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:50,080
rockets, but very rich people seem to like rockets. If they have any idea of the danger we're in here

472
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:57,520
on earth, I think it's a completely bizarre feature of wealth and brilliance that brilliant,

473
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:06,720
smart people choose rockets. Don't know why. We've got to do something. And we've never solved any

474
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:12,320
of these problems. And I don't think we're going to get to these problems by pretending. I mean,

475
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:18,640
I always want when somebody talks to me about what life will be like to bring up cephalopods.

476
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:24,320
But I look at a cuttlefish, and I look at how intelligent a cuttlefish is, maybe not as smart

477
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:32,240
as an octopus. But a cuttlefish is such an alien creature. It's so far away from us on the phylogenetic

478
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:38,640
tree that it proves that you can't really easily anticipate what smart looks like.

479
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:45,440
And it's probably the reason that the heptapods were used in that movie. What is it? Arrival?

480
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:55,120
Yeah. And I think that the next physical theory is going to blow our minds. I think we've sat so

481
00:50:55,120 --> 00:51:01,280
long pretending to have our minds blown by entanglement and Schrodinger's cat and the fact

482
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:13,840
that you get thinner and heavier in relativity theory, whatever, terrible paradox. That's not

483
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:21,280
really the mind blowing stuff. What's about to come, I think, is going to rewrite our knowledge

484
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:29,760
of ourselves just the way DNA did. So pitch me, I'm Elon. I can take $44 billion and put it

485
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:40,240
towards Twitter. I can scrap it or even make it $43 billion. What do you tell him? What should he do?

486
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:45,040
What would you do? He knows. I mean, what would I do? I mean, he's a physics major. He was a UPenn.

487
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:50,800
I mean, more than physics major, he's evidenced, I think, continuing interest in physics.

488
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:59,680
But he has hijacked the conversation of getting off the planet, which should be a conversation

489
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:05,680
about many, many, many, many, many, many different experiments rather than the moon and Mars.

490
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:11,920
And getting off with physics to being a conversation about rockets. So anytime you talk about diversifying

491
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:19,520
existential risk to humans, someone will now say, oh, don't worry, bro, Elon's going to get us to Mars

492
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:27,120
with those awesome, awesome rockets. It's like, I don't understand this. So I can't pitch Elon.

493
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:32,560
So would you go, I mean, but again, to push back with respect, as you know, I always do. And I

494
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:40,080
cheerfully recognize that I may have a huge blind spots myself. But it seems to me as if you're

495
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:46,320
going back to 1491 and you're telling, you know, Queen Ismerella or whoever. Don't fund this guy,

496
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:53,760
Chris. Chris C. Don't. He's just, wait, wait, wait. That doesn't make sense. We should do rockets.

497
00:52:54,400 --> 00:53:00,000
Okay. We shouldn't obsess about rockets. Right. Not rockets only in the portfolio. But again,

498
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:03,200
let me just finish my torture analogy because it took me like a half an hour to make it up in

499
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:08,320
the shower this morning. But, you know, you're telling her, we should really fund this guy,

500
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:14,000
you know, Yitzhak Newton, or, you know, get these laws that will actually take us to the moon.

501
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:19,760
You know, let's just skip ahead boats, forget about these barks and, and, and boats. Let's

502
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:25,280
galleons. Let's skip ahead. I don't know that that would actually get us where we want to go.

503
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:32,160
Right. Because you're saying, you know, this, your priors are going to be informed by the either,

504
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:36,480
and a no-go theorem that says we can't go beyond Einstein. In which case, what would you say,

505
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:42,960
there are no aliens? If we couldn't go beyond Einstein, yeah, we're trapped in the world.

506
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:48,800
There's no, so like, this is another problem, which is, is that Einstein hijacked the conversation

507
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:54,240
so that now every time we talk, it's like, no, dude, we have time dilation, we have worm holes.

508
00:53:54,320 --> 00:54:03,040
It's like, we have alcubierre drives. Blinding them. Oh, no, I thought you were making a crypto

509
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:08,240
enthusiast with laser eyes. That's right. Einstein with laser eyes. I told you. Okay.

510
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,840
Don't you? Okay. So,

511
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:19,840
I don't think Elon shouldn't do rockets. I think rockets is a profitable business. And I think

512
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:25,280
getting people excited about the future has to do with going back to the last moment when we actually,

513
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:30,480
as a country, you know, we didn't want to say, let's develop ICBMs that are really efficient in

514
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:35,760
hitting Beijing and Moscow. We said, we choose to go to the moon.

515
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:47,520
And, okay. So, you know, true enough. So go to the moon. But stop with the terraforming in Mars,

516
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:57,200
the light of human civilization. I just, you have to actually want to save us from ourselves right

517
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:03,920
now and talk about it in order to realize how completely crazy Elon has made everyone who

518
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:11,840
listens to him. Because at the moment, if you had Einstein and you had Elon, people would be gravitating

519
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:21,920
to Elon. He's charismatic. He's nailed in a world which is not comfortable with masculine traits.

520
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:29,920
He's highly chaotic. He's very entertaining. And people have this idea like, yo, dude,

521
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:33,760
he's the richest man in the world, bro. And that's the currency of our time.

522
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:39,840
So my feeling about this is everyone, Elon reaches with the story of terraforming Mars

523
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:48,640
with rockets and all this kind of stuff, thinks that's the plan. And I just think it's completely

524
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:57,120
crazy to get everything right and then go rockets terraforming Mars right at the end and just like,

525
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:04,160
dude, I just read this entire, you know, war and peace length novel and then in the last page, you

526
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:10,880
just do something completely bizarre. I just don't get it. Maybe I'm dumb. Maybe I don't,

527
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:15,200
I don't understand. I don't think it's Ferdinand and Isabella. I think that they, you know, we needed

528
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:22,160
to fund universities that studied natural philosophy and mathematics and physics. And we needed to

529
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:27,040
explore the world because we didn't know what was here. And we should go to Mars and we should go to

530
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:32,160
the moon. And we should have, if somebody said that our rocket allocation is stupid, we should

531
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:37,520
take it to zero, I would be fighting tooth and nail to make sure that rockets are budgeted.

532
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:43,280
Okay. The emphasis on rockets is psychotic.

533
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:51,760
It's like you're looking at a portfolio of a very, very rich person that's only in one municipal

534
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:56,880
bond or something. And you're like, make this make sense.

535
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:04,480
Yeah, he is. But then, of course, he is, you know, more diversified neurologically than almost

536
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:09,920
anybody. I'm just saying that he doesn't have the right to hijack the rock that the

537
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:15,840
we need to spread out and diversify because we're going to get ourselves killed on one planet with

538
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:23,680
a shared atmosphere. It's completely unreasonable for him. It's wonderful. I mean, I just, I have a

539
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:28,320
very clear idea that he's one of the smartest, most forward thinking people, and he's got a

540
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:35,280
rocket company and he's talking in some sense his book. Right. And he knows, look, I don't know him,

541
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,640
but I almost, I almost feel like I can guarantee you he knows better.

542
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:48,640
And so, you know, I don't want to speculate on what his strategy is, but he knows better than to

543
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:53,200
bet everything on Mars terraforming and the moon with rockets. Right.

544
00:57:54,080 --> 00:58:03,840
Now, pivoting maybe slightly away, we look at, you know, what what we could do, you pointed to one

545
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:09,680
thing in there, you mentioned universities and how important they were. Now in 1492, the university

546
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:16,560
system was only about 400 years old at that point. And and it's it's aged since then and starting in

547
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:24,080
1080 or so in Bologna. And very little has changed. And I wonder, you know, the best and the brightest,

548
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:29,840
so to speak, what they might be getting sucked up into this orbit of Elon, no pun intended,

549
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:34,560
or this this kind of thinking or many other things crypto. But at least people like Michael

550
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:40,720
Saylor, who I had on the show last year, is very gracious and forward thinking as well.

551
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:46,400
You know, he started Saylor Academy. And that's sort of a university that only is going to produce

552
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:52,080
STEM majors, not going to produce, you know, gender studies majors, and it's not going to produce

553
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:56,640
things that are not related to pure science, technology, engineering and math, because he

554
00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:01,680
believes that we need, you know, a million PhDs in these fields in order for us to progress. And

555
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:07,120
actually, I think the limiting factor for Elon is going to be humans. It's not going to be robots.

556
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:12,320
It's not going to be capital. It's going to be having enough people. And so the fault that I have

557
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:17,440
for him is that I don't see any and I'm not saying, Oh, give, you know, yesterday, a billion,

558
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:22,160
$100 million was given to Stanford University for sustainability. I'm not even saying Elon,

559
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:26,800
you know, hook, you see up Steve up with with the Musk Institute will churn out your P it because

560
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:31,280
I don't think I can do it either. Is that is there fundamental limitation for us getting off the

561
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:36,240
planet in your language, or becoming interplanetary in his language or transcending the laws of physics

562
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:40,640
in your language getting off the planetary species and his life? Is it humans? And is it

563
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:45,680
solvable? Because I can't just nuclear it as good as I am. I can't just nuclear it out of the vacuum

564
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:53,680
kids. Well, but okay, so let's look at the very weird question of anybody with a halfway interesting

565
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:59,520
version of a theory beyond the standard model. And I don't mean

566
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:07,600
sorry, I'm going to be very careful about the phrase. We have large programs,

567
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:13,280
grand unification, supersymmetry, technicolor, super strings, etc.

568
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:22,560
These are the big programs. More or less, if you're not on a big program, I know of almost no one

569
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:33,040
inside the university system, who's got a truly interesting audacious idea for what to do next.

570
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:41,440
I could tell you that, you know, Peter Wojt, for example, has moved from being a curmudgeon

571
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:47,520
to actually saying this I believe, which is fascinating. I mean, imagine if Sabina Hossenfelder,

572
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:54,240
instead of complaining about the gobbledygook or the fact that people are actually, you know,

573
01:00:54,240 --> 01:01:01,040
and she's quite accurate, I think, about this overselling things that don't work. But I really

574
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:07,760
love that Peter moved towards saying this is what I think may be generating all of this.

575
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:14,800
He's there in a nontraditional role inside of the math department of Columbia University. He's

576
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:22,080
writing books, he's writing papers, he's giving talks, but he's not a professor. Same thing with,

577
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:27,680
you know, David Deutch has a really weird situation at Oxford. Garrett Lisey has a very

578
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:33,440
weird situation wherever he is. Julian Barbour has a weird situation. Stephen Wolfram.

579
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:42,960
Inside the universities, we've turned it into the Hunger Games academically, and so everyone

580
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:46,960
is worried about survival and nobody's actually worried about physics because they're worried

581
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:52,480
about personal survival, they're not worried about general survival. I think what you have to look at

582
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:57,440
is that there is a reluctance. I mean, one of the things I say that doesn't win me a ton of

583
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:06,080
friends is that it appears that nobody actually has any money. And the reason that I say that is

584
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:15,200
that all sorts of, it feels to me like nobody, we have, there were Rockefellers. They built

585
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:21,040
Rockefeller University and the University of Chicago, one of our absolute jewels. You know,

586
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:25,680
Vanderbilt, there's a Vanderbilt University, Carnegie had money, there's a Carnegie,

587
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:34,800
Leyland Stanford, we don't want to invest anymore in this stuff. There's a general anti-science

588
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:40,240
thing partially, I think, fueled by the fact that when Anthony Fauci says, I am the science, trust

589
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:52,480
the science, we are revulsed, we recoil in war, maybe I should say it that way. And I think people

590
01:02:52,480 --> 01:03:01,600
who have money are turning away from universities because those containers are seemingly very

591
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:10,640
susceptible to revolutionary nonsense. And so why would you build a container and then put great

592
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:18,000
stuff in it only to have it instantly corrupted by the associate dean of niceness goodness and

593
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:26,800
fluffy puppy dogs for pediatric oncology patients? You know, it's like, okay, we need to help kids

594
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:34,000
who are facing cancer, we need, I have a dog, I like good things, ice cream, blah, blah, blah, blah.

595
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:41,280
But the university is attesting to their own fundamental goodness at every turn and denouncing

596
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:49,760
everyone who disagrees with them as Genghis Khan Hitler or Lizzie Borden or whatever. It's not a

597
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:59,200
very appealing pitch to people with resources. So what I'm seeing is that more or less people

598
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:06,720
with incredible resources don't want to spend on things that are important. They've been tinged

599
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:26,080
with this kind of failure and greediness. And I think one of the things we need to do is if the

600
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:32,480
government is just going to renege on the endless frontier compact between the universities and

601
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:38,960
the federal government, I don't want to be in a intellectual property category where we can't

602
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:45,200
monetize what we discover. I just want to take you by your ankles and say, God damn it, you fooled us,

603
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:49,680
give us all our money back that we generated for you. We built the entire economy and you treat us

604
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:56,800
like we're your servants, you're making me sick to my stomach. For God's sakes, grow a pair and

605
01:04:56,800 --> 01:05:01,520
recognize you've got the world's greatest deal and that these people basically have integrity and

606
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:06,960
you're turning their lives upside down into a horror where people don't want to go into their

607
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:13,760
offices and universities. When I was just touring universities on the East Coast, professors would

608
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:18,240
close their doors and in hushed tones, they would say, I can't really say this outside, but things

609
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:22,960
have gotten really crazy here. And I'm thinking, you're the owners of the university. No matter

610
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:28,080
what anyone tells you, you don't want to send your kid to a university that isn't run effectively by

611
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:33,600
its professors. Universities are not primarily about teaching. You should go to a college if

612
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:38,960
you're focused on teaching. Universities are about research. The research is done by professors

613
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:46,560
and by far the most important research is done in STEM. I mean, I think there's very important

614
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:51,360
research that's been done in folklore, ethnomusicology was something I considered going into.

615
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:58,640
There's plenty of things that can be researched that aren't STEM. But the most important things we

616
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:05,280
do is to better understand the world in which we live, gain power and wisdom to control it.

617
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:11,840
And if the humanities aren't going to be giving us wisdom, but are going to be giving us negative

618
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:18,240
wisdom, it's very important that anybody with hate in their heart who talks about anti-racism all

619
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:23,920
day long, which is just another name for racism, should not be informing people who might have to

620
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:31,280
make nuclear weapons or fuel air explosives or any one of the horrible things that we may need to

621
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:38,800
keep ourselves safe. It's very important to keep lunatics away from the stuff that actually works.

622
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:50,160
And I mean, I've always agreed with you in general terms, but I do feel like we have kind of an

623
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:58,480
opportunity that is only kind of full of latency when it's thought prospectively in the future.

624
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:06,160
In other words, the inventor of the laser, Charlie Towns or the inventor of GPS and

625
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:12,720
things like that or Einstein, these people died, you know, not wealthy people. And yet,

626
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:19,120
if they had attempted, and yet the creator of Ethernet, you know, the three-com, you know,

627
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:20,160
is currently a triple-

628
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:21,680
What terms, Brian?

629
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:25,760
Wealthy financially. So we can define wealth other ways, obviously.

630
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:31,280
But let's pause that just for one second. I'm going to disagree in very strong terms.

631
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:37,280
I went into academics in large measure for freedom.

632
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:42,960
And that's why people go into business for freedom.

633
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:49,280
I think that if you priced the freedom that somebody like Noam Chomsky enjoyed,

634
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:55,680
you know, probably had his pension taken care of, probably was made an institute professor at MIT,

635
01:07:55,680 --> 01:08:02,400
could draw off on any topic. He had this giant army behind him that would stand up for his freedom

636
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:10,480
of expression and freedom of inquiry. The functional equivalent of Noam Chomsky's wealth was absolutely

637
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:11,520
enormous.

638
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:16,320
Oh, sure. I'm not debating that. And you can have, by the way, you can have both. Elon, you know,

639
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:20,480
dictates you can have both. You can have intellectual capital as well. But I'm thinking purely

640
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:26,720
for the translation ability of wealth to then be used to research purposes. So you made the argument

641
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:31,680
that we should have taxed, you know, semiconductor instructions or emails, all of which are invented

642
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:32,880
by physicists or appliances.

643
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:36,800
No, we shouldn't have done that. We should have kept our agreements. But if you're going to be a

644
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:43,120
prick about it, by all means, you're basically taking everything that was developed by people

645
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:50,160
that you've now treated as your servants, who you've actually legally hobbled. And my feeling

646
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:54,080
about this is that's completely unethical.

647
01:08:54,080 --> 01:09:00,240
100%. All I'm saying is that the biggest lie in finance is that past performance isn't indicative

648
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:06,480
of future, you know, returns. I mean, look at, look at whatever, pick whatever pre.com company

649
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:11,680
you like. So all I'm saying is that given that academia and academicians like the ones that

650
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:15,440
you mentioned have been treated like garbage and that physicists have not been able to not

651
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:20,080
monetize for our selfish own internal purposes, which I believe we deserve. But I'm not going

652
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:26,000
to talk about that for the purpose of physics for the greater glory of physics. I claim we need

653
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:31,200
to start with an educational campaign now. In other words, we say the next project that's going

654
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:36,400
to be developed with quantum computing or before it's monetized, and we lose the rights to say,

655
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:41,600
hold on, I didn't sign off on this IP, we need to be smart. And I don't think there's any training

656
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:44,960
you know, certainly I'm guilty. I don't train my graduates since I'm blessed to have so many

657
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:48,800
brilliant kids. I never sit down. So if you ever get into a situation, I have two patents, by the

658
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:52,480
way. I never sit down and say like, if I'm ever in the situation where this thing could make,

659
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:57,280
you know, millions of like, here's what I should do in order to benefit. But I think we need something.

660
01:09:57,280 --> 01:10:01,520
It's it should be in some way incorporated into our education. And I think the best way to do that

661
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:07,200
ironically is through the humanities show through history of physics as you know better than anybody.

662
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:10,880
Although I always say it's if you want to if you want to damn somebody with fake praise and as a

663
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:16,080
scientist, he's really knowledgeable about the history of physics, you know, it's like, it's

664
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:20,720
such a backhanded compliment. But you do in all honesty, and all seriousness, you do understand

665
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:26,560
it. Let me get back on that because that's kind of a dig. My feeling about this is you don't need

666
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:33,040
to know the history of physics if you want to do relatively workman like scientific research.

667
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:38,240
The only people who really need to understand the history of physics aren't most physicists. It's

668
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:43,920
the tiny number of people who are going to do things like break new ground. So it's really

669
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:48,880
important not to sell the history of physics to everybody, you can become a calculation monkey

670
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:55,520
and go to any calculation monkey school and do calculation monkey equations. That's fine.

671
01:10:56,160 --> 01:11:02,080
The really hard thing is to try to figure out how did people break out of cognitive prisons?

672
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:08,640
And so, you know, some of the funniest things is when people have these insults,

673
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:14,400
like the one you just said, it's like, well, yeah, because you didn't understand what it was

674
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:21,120
about to begin with. Yeah, I agree. I guess all I'm saying is wouldn't it be great to have education

675
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:28,000
so that the next time we invent the internet, you know, hypertext protocols, that we can think

676
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:32,400
for a second now, how do we do this? How do we renegotiate the contract? That's what I want to

677
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:37,760
say. You're a very astute, you've picked up on the problem, but we can't go back and rectify the

678
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:42,400
past performance, but we can say, given the way that the history of the field is gone, you want to

679
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:49,760
invent the quantum, you know, Bose-Einstein condensate laser that will be used for God knows what,

680
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:55,760
before you do that, we should have an honest conversation about our crisper or whatever.

681
01:11:55,760 --> 01:12:04,080
Well, where are the mega fortunes that are interested in this stuff? And my claim is,

682
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:10,800
you know, we both talked to Jim Simons. Jim knows how important this stuff is, and he's put a fair

683
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:17,920
amount of capital behind this. In my, you know, at some point, I had a conversation with him

684
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:23,920
about fixing education. And he said, I spent a fair amount of time on it. And the only thing

685
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:27,760
that actually seemed to make sense is to take terrible teachers and make them slightly less

686
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:34,720
terrible. And it was just, it was a heartbreaking thing. So I've seen people plow money into some

687
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:44,160
of these things and get very little back. The things that work can't be said very easily right

688
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:50,400
now because they're out of keeping with the ethos of our time. You meet people, how do you know

689
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:59,120
who's good? Because you talk to them. You find out whether they have 12 ideas before

690
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:06,000
they have a cup of coffee and three of them are good, you know, three good ideas. That's

691
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:16,000
astounding. It's hard to have good ideas. We basically know who's good. And we don't get to

692
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:23,040
dial their facial characteristics or look at their chromosomes or whatever. You know, good is good.

693
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:33,200
Famously, Ramanujan was, you know, sent a letter to Hardy and Hardy and Little would read it in

694
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:40,400
Cambridge and they said, well, either he's a humbug or a genius. And we guessed genius because

695
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:48,640
humbugs are relatively rare. Beautiful one. We know who's good. We know who to fund and we

696
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:53,360
know how to leave people alone and nobody wants to do it. Everybody wants to say, oh, it's all in

697
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:59,760
the ethos and the myth of the lone individual and, you know, this is so elitist, all this kind of

698
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:05,280
nonsense. Okay, well, I don't know how to tell you this, but you're just, you're wrong 12,000 ways

699
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:11,440
from Sunday. And you're going to destroy everything that we know how to do. Many of the people who

700
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:18,400
make real breakthroughs are very difficult to deal with. And if you don't want to deal with people

701
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:24,320
who are difficult to deal with, you can just sort of write off most progress. Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't

702
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:32,320
leave Feynman alone with my daughter or your daughter. But but he sure knew his way. That's

703
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:36,960
true because we don't want Feynman maced or kicked in the groin because he's a valuable human.

704
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:42,960
And our kids are skilled in the deadly arts of the groin attack from Krav Maga training that we

705
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:49,440
give them. And that is a mitzvah for all of you. Yes, exactly. So we're talking with Eric Weinstein,

706
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:55,520
proprietor of the portal podcast, among the other things. You can find Eric at Eric R Weinstein

707
01:14:55,520 --> 01:15:02,240
at both Twitter and on Instagram. He has a website. It was about a year ago, we had a conversation

708
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:08,640
about geometric unity. And I want to talk about that. Because it's still it's still it haunts

709
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:15,040
my dreams. It's still something that's very delightful. And and it represents a sort of a

710
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:21,120
sort of, you know, candle in the darkness, a sort of hope, a scream in the void, thinking big things.

711
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:26,640
Obviously, it's not, you know, there are people that have, as you mentioned, Peter Boyd, Garrett

712
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:33,680
Leasy, there, there are a surf fight of other contender theories that have their own lacunae.

713
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:38,800
But where, where, where are you now with with geometric unity? Where is the project at this

714
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:45,520
point? Well, I'm talking to a lot more different physicists. And who have you met with most recently

715
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:50,160
that's most exciting for you, besides present company, obviously. Well, I mean, I don't want to

716
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:55,200
get into details, but I think probably one of the best conversations I had recently might have been

717
01:15:55,200 --> 01:16:04,800
with Nima, Arkani Hamed. There's a local graduate student, I'm going to mention his name, because

718
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:12,960
he deserves it. And what is the name to watch Trevor Schopener at UCLA is an unbelievable

719
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:21,120
up and coming guy in things V burns group. But I've been, you know, talking with Avi about

720
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:27,840
astrophysics, discussed with Alan Gooth recently, some aspects of

721
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:38,560
how multiple generations are generated. Just a fairly colleagues in France.

722
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:47,120
I've been, I've been very lucky to have access to great people. And I think that one of the things

723
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:57,520
that's happened is that with supersymmetry, and with string theory, not being able to

724
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:04,480
find something that really shows us that they're on the right track.

725
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:16,320
People are slowly open to the idea of either shutting high energy, fundamental physics down,

726
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:22,480
and it's going to be up in arms about that. There's like a huge move to move towards

727
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:28,160
quantum computation. You say, why is that? It's like, oh, well, because computers have

728
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:33,360
been really important. And so the metaphor of the universe as a computer is really important.

729
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:42,240
Information, maybe we can rebase everything around information. It's something you can do, you can try.

730
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:48,160
But I think right at the moment, where we are is that

731
01:17:53,680 --> 01:18:02,480
we realize that the Baby Boomer program has run its course. The Baby Boomer program was strings.

732
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:12,720
Almost all of the people in string theory came up. They viewed the world a particular way. They

733
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:20,640
changed the problems that we thought of as fundamental. Quantizing gravity became the

734
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:30,480
problem to work on, which I think was absolutely wrong. And what we find ourselves in is a world in

735
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:36,640
which the old thing that was crowding out everything else is in the process of dying,

736
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:41,200
and that is string fundamentalism. And one of the great things about talking to Nima

737
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:50,960
was, for me, that Nima is not captured by strings, but he's animated by strings,

738
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:57,120
which is exactly the right position to be in, which is that you're not 100% sure that strings

739
01:18:57,360 --> 01:19:01,280
are the right direction to go. But you can say, look at all of the things that string theory

740
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:10,480
accomplishes inside of quantum field theory. It gives us paradigmatic ways in which we can elude

741
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:16,880
certain seemingly no-go theorems and the like, or it's taught us a lot. And I think that the toy

742
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:22,800
theories that really came along with the string guys, because the string guys are mostly guys,

743
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:34,400
not 100%, but too much, more or less used a lot of toy quantum field theories to explore some of

744
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:40,640
these ideas. That was a second program. That was very good, by the way, on their part for developing

745
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:45,360
quantum field theory as a discipline, but it's been a disaster for uncovering new physical

746
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:52,160
law and new physical explanations. So I do think that right at the moment, people would be open,

747
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:57,680
but there's no, we should be building accelerators. We should be getting people,

748
01:19:57,680 --> 01:20:02,880
here's the crazy thing, Brian. I'm dancing around it and trying not to say it, but maybe I'll just

749
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:10,560
say it. We just had this W mass announcement. The W particle appears to be much heavier,

750
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:17,360
and by much, I don't mean like three times as heavy, but I mean by an appreciable amount,

751
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:23,680
heavier than we thought. And I watch everyone's explanations of this to the public,

752
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:29,120
and I haven't seen one that really sounds to me like what this thing actually is.

753
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:36,640
We settle on these, here's how we talk to the public about the W message. Well, what is the

754
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:44,560
W particle? It's more or less a part of a derivative from calculus. And what does a derivative want

755
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:50,480
to do? It wants to differentiate functions. Well, what functions does it have? Well, it can

756
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:57,200
differentiate something called a Higgs field. Now, if you look at this mug, for example, and I'm not

757
01:20:57,200 --> 01:21:04,320
good at going around. Drinking and deriving. Drinking and deriving. That term right there,

758
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:16,480
which probably looks like d sub mu of phi norm squared. That term is where the W particle interacts

759
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:21,520
with the Higgs particle. So you're effectively using the W particle to differentiate a Higgs

760
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:29,360
particle just the way you use the photon to differentiate an electron. That process by which

761
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:38,320
the Higgs particle gives mass to a small number of pieces of a derivative, the W and Z particles.

762
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:46,480
It gives mass in some sense to itself. You've got this potential term here. You've got Yukawa terms

763
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:55,280
here where it's giving mass the same phi is occurring here. All of, sorry, not hold that up. So this

764
01:21:55,360 --> 01:22:00,960
is where the W particle is getting mass. This is where the Higgs is getting mass from itself

765
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:10,240
through its interaction with the Mexican hat potential, the sombrero. The Yukawa term where the

766
01:22:10,240 --> 01:22:16,640
fermions, the electrons and protons get mass. That whole system isn't explained to anybody in the

767
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:23,920
public, which is criminal. And then I've sort of been in this kind of self-examination phase,

768
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:28,880
which is, oh, Eric, you use so many big words. Why can't we understand you? I was like, well,

769
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:33,200
one thing is almost nobody's actually trying to tell you what's really going on.

770
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:38,640
And when I sit there and I say, okay, the W particle is part of a derivative,

771
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:45,200
all my colleagues know what I'm saying. But they're not venturing out there to say

772
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:50,080
something so simple. And I don't know why they're not doing it. So the public isn't animated.

773
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:58,160
Like, the fact is, this mug, if you had this mug in your house and you said,

774
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:01,840
more or less, everything other than gravity is on that mug,

775
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:09,040
somebody would want to know, one person in your family, like, well, how do I read it?

776
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:15,440
What does it mean? What are the different terms? Do they have names? Nobody is talking to the public

777
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:23,360
about what it is that we do. And that's how I get into trouble. I say, hey, I have an

778
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:28,560
explanation for why there are three generations of matter. I don't even know that's a problem.

779
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:35,760
So if you think about the sort of things that GU is doing different than, let's say, Garrett or

780
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:41,760
Peter White, one of the things I think that's exciting is that a good theory should probably

781
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:48,000
tell the standard model and general relativity what it got wrong. And I don't think anybody

782
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:52,160
inside of the academic system wants to do that. They want to extend only.

783
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:58,080
You know, and this is why, for example, everybody will add sterile neutrinos to the standard model,

784
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:01,600
because it's like, it's the least offensive thing that won't screw anything up.

785
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:08,640
So I've been thinking a lot about this, which is why do why do none of us talk to the public

786
01:24:08,720 --> 01:24:14,000
in real terms? Why do we allow Feynman's dumbest statements to characterize

787
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:19,440
what seems to be the height of sophistication? If you can't explain it to your grandma, it means

788
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:24,720
you don't understand it. If I can't create the word world myself, then I'm useless. It's like,

789
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:31,040
okay, well, it's a lot of machismo, but it's not very smart. And in those

790
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:38,400
opportunities, none of us are really filling it in. We're not talking about what the W particle is.

791
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:41,920
We're not talking about why it's important. We're not talking about why this is so exciting.

792
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:46,880
I can hardly sleep. I don't even know that it's real. Maybe it may be wrong.

793
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:51,840
Well, we know things are real. We know calculus is real. And let's start with a,

794
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:56,080
you know, when I learned calculus, I had a self teach it to myself, because I actually wasn't

795
01:24:56,080 --> 01:25:01,440
placed along a math track that would have taken me to take the APs. And I had to kind of self

796
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:05,360
motivate. And that came because of the love of astronomy that I wanted to find out, well,

797
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:09,680
how do we know these galaxies are moving away? How do we know Haley's comets orbit and all sorts

798
01:25:09,680 --> 01:25:14,320
of things that were going on at the time when I was a, you know, preteen? And so I had to teach

799
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:19,680
it myself. But once I learned it, I kind of felt like I had, you know, gotten the cheat code, you

800
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:24,320
know, just I started to see things in a different way. And I went through the portal. And at that

801
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:30,000
moment, I felt a great gift had been given to me. And it was given by myself. But in the sense that

802
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:34,480
I was given these gifts from the great people that came before me, including my hero, Gale,

803
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:39,840
Gale, who I want to talk about, because I have exciting news about a wonderful project that

804
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:45,760
I've been blessed to work on the last couple of years now, and it's come to fruition. But I feel

805
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:49,840
like we're doing a disservice. That's why I say, I kind of joke in the past, but I'm getting more

806
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:54,880
and more serious. I feel the scientists like me, especially like me, who get paid by the public,

807
01:25:55,680 --> 01:26:03,040
have a moral obligation to teach the most exciting and most delightful, delicious developments

808
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:08,160
to the public for free. And they should do that as part of their as part of their job, quote,

809
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:12,800
and they'll say, I'm not good at it. And to which I'll say, oh, yeah, I forgot, when you were born,

810
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:15,840
you knew quantum field theory. Oh, no, no, I had to learn that it was very hard. And it's very

811
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:20,480
sophisticated. Okay, so you spend time on things you think are valuable, right, my fellow professors.

812
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:25,280
And it doesn't make me popular around the faculty club. But I do believe that, you know, especially,

813
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:30,240
but in every professor, every scientist is supported by the public at some level or another.

814
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:34,400
So, you know, we have a we have a huge we have a branding problem, we talked about the marketing

815
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:42,320
problem. But we also have kind of a an education and a self obligation that scientists don't feel,

816
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:46,080
we feel like we can sit around be the be the equation monkeys that you were talking about

817
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:52,320
before. It's not true, Brian. I just, I mean, disagree with this. Here's the basic problem,

818
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:56,240
because I've gone through this now. Let's imagine you want to understand what the W

819
01:26:56,240 --> 01:27:01,520
particle is in the Higgs particle and why this matters, right? So there's some safe thing that

820
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:08,000
everyone can say, and then you can try to actually be real, and then get attacked. So I don't like

821
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:14,080
being attacked. It's, I've got idiots who follow me around who call up my colleagues and try to

822
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:21,680
alienate everyone for me. And my feeling about these people is, once you understand what the

823
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:29,120
cost is, you understand why nobody does it. But here's a cord, okay? This cord represents a function.

824
01:27:30,160 --> 01:27:37,440
The height of the cord is a function. And the W particle is in part a level.

825
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:46,720
And that level could be horizontal. Or we could use the level to define what is horizontal.

826
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:53,360
Right? And so if I pick this, we all know that the derivative is the rise over run above that level.

827
01:27:54,560 --> 01:28:00,640
But if I say, you know what, I have fiat power, and I'm going to decide that not this, but this

828
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:06,080
is level, then the cord that is tangent at that point is actually constant, even though it appears

829
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:14,880
to be rising. Okay? Now, I didn't use any big words. You're watching the con Eric showing off

830
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:19,440
Eric is doing this. In the comments, people are saying, Eric, please read a book about this.

831
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:26,480
Well, some, most of them, but my point is a tiny number of people who are terrible and who just

832
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:32,640
don't want good things to happen, don't want us to try and fumble in front of the public.

833
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:39,360
And they don't want us to succeed because then we get large follower counts. And it's like, well,

834
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:44,960
why is that guy the most, you know, followed mathematician on Twitter? It's like, that should

835
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:50,320
be me. Okay, maybe it should be you. I'll tell you the one thing, if you really have enemies,

836
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:57,440
wish them fame, I promise you, they want it. You don't want it. It's a great deal.

837
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:06,320
What we need to do is to be more courageous about saying, look, you're not going to understand

838
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:10,240
quantum field theory, but here's some things you can break out. If you can keep up with the

839
01:29:10,240 --> 01:29:15,920
Kardashian, you can, you can keep up with quarks, you can keep up with hadrons and leptons. There

840
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:21,440
aren't so many, there aren't so many hadrons and leptons that you can't learn them all in an afternoon.

841
01:29:22,720 --> 01:29:26,560
Right? They're probably about as many fundamental particles as there are Kardashians.

842
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:33,680
And the idea that we don't talk about this, we don't traffic in it, we're not excited about this.

843
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:41,920
Think about 90 years ago, this is the 90th year anniversary of the neutron. We didn't

844
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:48,000
know that there were neutrons. So my aunt, who is in her late 90s, grew up before there were

845
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:52,480
neutrons. So when she was a very little girl, nobody knew what a neutron was. Almost immediately

846
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:57,600
after the discovery of neutrons, we get chain reactions. We get atomic weapons and atomic power.

847
01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:08,160
That discovery within living memory made the world a completely different place.

848
01:30:08,160 --> 01:30:14,720
And watch out for what comes next. As an adaptation of the old saying, you may not be

849
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:23,120
interested in physics, but boy is physics going to be interested in it. And the idea that you're

850
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:29,840
not part of the conversation, which is who are we, what is this place and can we go and look at

851
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:39,840
the night sky and dream responsibly without wormholes and without sci-fi of visiting. If that

852
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:45,680
doesn't animate you, I guarantee you, you probably can't find a Jimi Hendrix guitar solo that moves

853
01:30:45,680 --> 01:30:50,960
you either. And that brings up the other chords that you're capable of bringing out and show your

854
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:55,680
guitar. We're going to get that at the very end. So people in the chat room are saying things that

855
01:30:55,680 --> 01:31:03,040
Kim Kardashian actually has a nice set of bosons. That's kind of cool to know. But Eric, if actually

856
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:10,000
listeners and viewers, 800 people watching right now, if you'd like Eric to write a book about this,

857
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:16,400
give a thumbs up to this video, and we'll see if we can create the groundswell necessary

858
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:22,080
to do this labor of love, which is writing a book. And I've actually just produced my third

859
01:31:22,640 --> 01:31:28,720
book, and I can't believe it, three books in four years. This one I didn't write. So this one I had

860
01:31:28,720 --> 01:31:34,560
a ghost writer, literally, and the name of the ghost writer. Are we on the verge of a major

861
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:40,240
announcement, which I don't even know? You don't know it. It is a major announcement, at least in

862
01:31:40,240 --> 01:31:45,520
my life. I've been putting it out on Twitter here and there. But now I want to come clean and really

863
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:55,520
announce it for all time. And that is 390 years ago. So 300 years before the neutron. A man by

864
01:31:55,520 --> 01:32:01,680
the name of Galileo Galilei wrote a book that got him in a tiny bit of hot water. He was kind of the

865
01:32:01,680 --> 01:32:07,680
Weinstein of his day, not afraid to be provocative in some ways, take liberties and take a license.

866
01:32:07,680 --> 01:32:11,440
And he wrote a book called The Dialogue. And this book, it was in Italian, it was called The

867
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:17,280
Dialogue. And it was in contradistinction to his first book called The Ciderius Nuncius. Ciderius

868
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:23,120
Nuncius, as you all know, is Latin for starry messenger, and he was allowed to keep publishing

869
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:27,360
in Latin because nobody spoke Latin. And so it wasn't a threat to the Catholic Church.

870
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:32,640
But after he used the spyglass, as he called it, the perspective tube, the telescope,

871
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:39,120
he found that he could not really get over the overwhelming evidence that was presented to him,

872
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:43,520
and he wanted to share it for the world with the notion that the universe is not centered on the

873
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:49,600
earth, it's centered on the sun. And so he was advancing Copernicus theory and other earlier

874
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:53,760
theories as well. And he wrote this wonderful book. It's called The Dialogue. It's actually a

875
01:32:53,760 --> 01:33:00,160
trial log between three characters, one of whom is modeled after Galileo himself. And he gave

876
01:33:00,160 --> 01:33:06,560
this character the name Salviati, the salvation. And then the other one was modeled after the

877
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:11,600
Pope, Pope Urban, and his arguments. And he put his arguments in the name of a character named

878
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:18,720
Simplicio, the simpleton. I love this because it shows that even the most biggest geniuses in

879
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:24,880
academia can have huge fatal flaws in their impolitic behavior. And then there's a third

880
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:30,880
character who's an intelligent layperson. His name is Sagredo. So I got the most famous two Italians

881
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:38,720
that I know, Carlo Revelli and Fabiola Gianatti, who you love for her use of comic sans. And so

882
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:45,600
we at the Higgs-Boson announcement. So we should say that one of them is a famous theorist. It's

883
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:56,880
attached to Luke quantum gravity. The other one is a big shot physicist with the CERN experiment.

884
01:33:56,880 --> 01:34:02,560
Yeah, the director of CERN, which is where the LHC is located and responsible for discovery of

885
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:08,960
the Higgs-Boson. So we and along with Jim Gates, who's another friend of yours, a professor at

886
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:13,360
the Ford Foundation, professor at Brown University, where I will be returning. And that's stay tuned

887
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:19,520
for a top secret announcement at the end of this month. I have great respect for him and I've

888
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:26,960
enjoyed meeting him, but we are not close. So the five or six of us put together a audio book,

889
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:33,120
the first ever audio book by Galileo. So it exists and you can get it wherever books or audio

890
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:39,040
bowl lies, including Amazon, Audible, Google Play, wherever you like. I'll put a link to it in the

891
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:43,680
show notes below. And it was really a labor of love. It took us a year to record it, edit it,

892
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:50,320
and our home studios are around the world in Italy. Carlo was in Italy and in Aix and Provence,

893
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:53,680
or however you pronounce that. And then my friend Lucio Picharillo is the third character.

894
01:34:54,240 --> 01:35:00,080
We recorded it. And so much of what comes through in this wonderful book is just beyond

895
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:05,280
my comprehension as a physicist. And actually, Frank Wilczek, I should say,

896
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:12,080
narrated the Nobel Prize winner 2004 Nobel Prize winner for Asymptotic Freedom.

897
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:18,720
He narrated the dedication by Albert Einstein, the forward to the book by Galileo, in which

898
01:35:18,720 --> 01:35:22,640
he calls this book by Galileo the most important book ever written.

899
01:35:23,120 --> 01:35:25,360
Einstein called Galileo's book.

900
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:30,480
Yes, Einstein called the dialogue the most, not just science book, but really the most important

901
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:36,080
book that had really ever been written, fiction, nonfiction, however you like to say it, including

902
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:41,920
his own work. So it was incredibly gratifying to have these people come together and do it.

903
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:46,480
And of course, this book is Italian, and it was written originally in Italian,

904
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:53,280
and we had to have it translated. And so anyway, I started off doing it really kind of as a kind

905
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:58,320
of a lark. But then I decided that there could be some spin off opportunities, not really just for

906
01:35:58,320 --> 01:36:03,520
me, but I think maybe for physics, and I want to get your impression on. So one thing about this

907
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:08,560
book, they're extremely expensive to get your hands on a original copy of the dialogue, 390-year-old

908
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:14,640
books are very rare, obviously. So I decided I have a collector friend who allowed me to scan

909
01:36:14,640 --> 01:36:20,320
pictures from it, and we're making NFTs of it. And at first, I thought it was kind of silly,

910
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:25,440
kind of crazy, why would you make an NFT of a physical product or whatever. But the more I

911
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:31,440
thought about it, like, what if we could do use blockchain technology and science, not just for

912
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:35,600
preserving or maybe maybe we could make a DAO, one of these organizations, these entities to buy

913
01:36:35,680 --> 01:36:41,760
these books before they get lost or stolen or whatever, a couple hundred thousand dollars to

914
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:48,720
get an original one. But what if we could either custodize it or if we could use it to generate

915
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:54,400
resources for physics. So I want to run that idea by you, not specifically with my Galileo project,

916
01:36:55,120 --> 01:37:01,040
but that's just kind of my testing the water with NFTs, but you can find that on my website,

917
01:37:01,120 --> 01:37:08,000
BrianKating.com. But for a fraction of an ether, but what do you think about NFTs and science?

918
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:11,680
What do you think about the prospects for using this blockchain technology?

919
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:19,200
By any means necessary is where I am at the moment. Malcolm X, I think, was correct that

920
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:25,360
we needed to, there's certain things that are just so important that I almost don't care how

921
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:34,720
they happen. My hope is that NFTs don't backfire on us because the right thing to do is to make

922
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:43,520
very serious people very rich in autonomy so that they never think about, you know, look,

923
01:37:45,120 --> 01:37:50,320
making somebody a low eight-digit millionaire, double-digit millionaire,

924
01:37:50,320 --> 01:37:57,280
is probably sufficient to give them an extremely nice life. And there are tons of those

925
01:37:57,920 --> 01:38:04,560
who do far less for us than the people who do our molecular biology, chemistry,

926
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:11,200
mathematics, and physics. So I do think that it's important if we're going to abandon all of our

927
01:38:11,200 --> 01:38:15,600
culture, we're going to leak everything, we're going to turn the universities into cesspools,

928
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:21,520
et cetera, et cetera. We've got to get a few money to the people who built everything for us,

929
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:29,680
in my opinion. What I don't want to see is I don't want to see it backfiring.

930
01:38:29,680 --> 01:38:32,880
I don't want to see a claim, oh, well, you guys have your NFTs, so you're good now.

931
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:40,880
It's like, no. We're scrambling because you screwed us over and you're idiots,

932
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:47,920
and it's time for you to be ethical and smart. That's a very hard conversation to have.

933
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:56,480
If we have to dramatize it by NFTs, so be it. But my feeling is, what if the NFT thing goes

934
01:38:56,480 --> 01:39:02,000
in different directions? If it goes through to the moon, then it's a great move. What if it goes

935
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:08,240
in the toilet? And now we've sort of staked our credibility on getting involved in something that

936
01:39:08,240 --> 01:39:16,640
has a Ponzi scheme built into it. I'm not saying it is a Ponzi scheme. There is Ponzi in NFT,

937
01:39:16,640 --> 01:39:23,440
just as there is Genius in NFT. I also want to point out that the concept of digital scarcity,

938
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:29,280
if you go back to the original blockchain white paper of Satoshi, it's very, very clear that

939
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:36,560
it's propagating something according to a conservation law, that you hand me your public key,

940
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:43,040
and I've got my private key, and I've got this token that I'm laying claim to. I can propagate

941
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:52,880
my token to you in this infinite chain of custody by virtue of the fact that something is conserved.

942
01:39:52,880 --> 01:40:01,040
Now, of course, you had to create new tokens out of the vacuum. But my belief is, is that one of

943
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:05,680
the things is we should be talking about this in terms of digital conservation laws and digital

944
01:40:05,680 --> 01:40:15,280
physics, and we should be active. And I also think that having been playing with the crypto

945
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:19,520
community a little bit, at first, they dismiss everybody because they think you come in from

946
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:25,520
outside and you don't care about anything. You just want to tell people things. But we do know

947
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:31,840
that there's a lot of homology between Bitcoin and gauge theory,

948
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:38,880
conservation principles. Conservation principles have to do with symmetry. I am sure that if you

949
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:44,880
and I got roaring drunk for two weeks with a whiteboard, we would come up with a symmetry principle

950
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:51,520
for Bitcoin using some version of a discretized nerder's theorem that took the conservation law

951
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:56,160
that allows us to propagate, you know, Satoshi's solution of the double spend problem

952
01:40:56,960 --> 01:41:07,040
is probably worthy of some amazing science prize. It's just an ingenious idea. And it's hard to

953
01:41:07,040 --> 01:41:14,160
understand what is the substrate of, is it the idea that the individual wallets, the public-private

954
01:41:14,160 --> 01:41:21,520
key pairs, is it computers and nodes? Because the interesting thing is that it was engineered

955
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:27,200
so that nodes could go dark. And, you know, that's like taking a chunk of space time out of commission.

956
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:37,040
I think it's really important that physics get involved with NFTs, with conservation laws,

957
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:43,280
with digital physics, and actually contribute into the system to make it much more useful.

958
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:47,920
And while some in the crypto community will say, oh, they're just talking their book and

959
01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:52,720
to a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail, you know, to a man with a gauge theory,

960
01:41:52,720 --> 01:41:59,280
everything looks like a conservation law. Just ignore those people. There are so many good people

961
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:04,640
in crypto who are interested in any interesting idea. We need to party with them. That's my thought.

962
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:11,760
So I want to ask you to look into your crystal ball, and maybe we'll do the the lightening

963
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:20,560
round as we like to do, Eric. Are we done with COVID? No. Explain.

964
01:42:23,360 --> 01:42:27,680
My feeling about this is that probably COVID is much worse than we thought,

965
01:42:28,640 --> 01:42:33,200
or that we understand, and that people who understood it were protecting us against something.

966
01:42:33,200 --> 01:42:38,800
I don't know this to be true, but if I had to make a guess. The reason that China is so ferocious

967
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:43,280
about trying to stamp COVID out, is that I worry that they know something, that it's not a flu,

968
01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:50,240
that it's a cumulative flu that destroys you, bout by bout. I don't know what this thing is,

969
01:42:50,240 --> 01:42:56,480
and I think it's it's criminal that we're so far into this. And we have no idea why China is behaving

970
01:42:56,480 --> 01:43:02,160
the way it's behaving, or why Fauci behaves the way he behaves, or Peter Dajik, or Ralph Barrick,

971
01:43:02,160 --> 01:43:07,760
or any of these people. Somehow this COVID is taking place outside of science.

972
01:43:09,040 --> 01:43:17,680
And it's, I'm worried that we don't understand what COVID is, and we don't know which wave is

973
01:43:17,680 --> 01:43:23,600
going to is going to hurt and how bad it. I mean, no, I don't think so. I think that

974
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:30,880
we decided that we're done with it because Omicron was relatively mild. But what COVID becomes next,

975
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:36,480
I worry that certain people have much better understanding than you and I do, and that they

976
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:41,840
know why this is so dangerous. I'm worried that they the government lied twice for different reasons.

977
01:43:42,400 --> 01:43:45,520
The first time I worry that they lied to protect what they were doing with

978
01:43:46,240 --> 01:43:52,960
DITRA, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency. Why was it working with EcoHealth Alliance Wuhan Lab?

979
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:58,320
Why under kindly Dr. Fauci, who seems to have something to do with a weapons portfolio,

980
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:03,680
getting around a couple of treaties that we signed and ratified in the 70s. I have no idea.

981
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:08,320
But I think that that was a self-protective lying. And then I think that there may have been public

982
01:44:08,320 --> 01:44:14,640
spirited lying saying if we could have told you what it is that we created in this cauldron,

983
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:20,960
we happen to have some inside information about this furan cleavage site and the potential to

984
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:27,360
attack T cells and the degradation and why this binds to so many different organs and can cross

985
01:44:27,360 --> 01:44:32,080
the blood brain. I'm worried that they know that this is a much worse disease than it appears

986
01:44:32,080 --> 01:44:37,520
and that we're going to find out over time why they were so draconian because it does look like

987
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:42,960
that they wildly overreacted, not to say that people didn't die, not to say that this wasn't

988
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:49,760
serious, but to shut down the world economy to the extent that they did clearly risked war

989
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:58,000
at some level. It wasn't that it was free. And so I'm very worried that we don't really understand

990
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:04,000
what COVID is and that Omicron seemed kind of relatively mild, but just wait something

991
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:09,200
that's going to be wave after wave. And we're going to learn over time what this thing really is.

992
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:16,480
Do you see the midterm elections coming off without a hitch? Do you think it'll be a nice,

993
01:45:16,480 --> 01:45:22,640
smooth orderly? I don't want to say transition to power. I don't want to assume what direction

994
01:45:22,640 --> 01:45:25,520
the elections are going to go. You think it's going to be a nice, smooth election of ever?

995
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:32,720
You're asking one of the middle children what to do about crazy mommy and crazy daddy and my

996
01:45:32,720 --> 01:45:44,960
feeling is that dad should go off into his meth den and mom should move out of the house with

997
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:50,960
her various lovers and the same people who were left should try to get back to the United States

998
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:57,040
of America. I don't know how to do this. I view the Republican and Democratic parties as being

999
01:45:57,040 --> 01:46:04,800
dead-enders. Again, it's the Thelma and Louise problem. Do you decide that Thelma is better than

1000
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:13,360
Louise if Louise takes longer to hit the ground by a nanosecond? I don't know. I view, I'm so,

1001
01:46:15,200 --> 01:46:18,800
you know what I've become? I've become a tensionist. It's like you've got bloods and

1002
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:23,760
crypts running your neighborhood and you don't want to go blood or crypt. You just want them to

1003
01:46:23,760 --> 01:46:29,200
fight each other enough so that the rest of you can go to work, go to school, and buy some groceries

1004
01:46:29,200 --> 01:46:38,080
without being terrorized. More upbeat note. Are we headed for an U.S. involvement on the ground

1005
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:47,600
in the Ukraine? Next question. Are you excited about any recent discoveries in physics? We talked

1006
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:52,800
about the W Boson mass discrepancy. By the way, it's not that the mass itself is so much higher.

1007
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:57,440
It's that the precision is so with tension with the standard model. Not that you said that,

1008
01:46:57,440 --> 01:47:02,880
but there are people in the chatroom wondering, is it eight times too high, five sigma? No,

1009
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:10,640
it's higher. The bounds on this thing are radically, radically tightened up. This is a new data,

1010
01:47:10,720 --> 01:47:18,960
this old data, new analysis. It should be taken with some degree of caution. But to that end,

1011
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:23,920
people have been speculating about the role of fifth forces and all sorts of things ranging from

1012
01:47:24,880 --> 01:47:31,920
G-2 discrepancy, the magnetic moment of the muon, etc. There are a lot of tensions. I always say

1013
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:37,120
physicists need a psychologist. I think we've got so much tension on our minds. Where do you think,

1014
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:42,320
what's exciting you? If you were a young physicist or if you knew a young physicist

1015
01:47:42,320 --> 01:47:48,880
who's starting out, what would you advise her to do? What excites you most in physics?

1016
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:53,920
A theorist? We should talk about an experimentalist and a theorist. I think we should talk about the

1017
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:58,880
experimentalist first because I think one of the things that you've done is to emphasize that

1018
01:47:58,880 --> 01:48:05,440
constantly focusing on the lead singer. We're always talking about Mick Jagger and Keith Richards

1019
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:10,800
holding it down and making the thing awesome. Let's talk evenly about them. What should a

1020
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:17,120
young experimentalist do? My feeling about that is you should figure out where there might be money

1021
01:48:17,120 --> 01:48:22,480
and where there might be new tools. I would be thinking a lot about high precision experiments.

1022
01:48:22,480 --> 01:48:28,800
I would be thinking a lot about gravitational waves because that's still relatively new. I would

1023
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:35,440
be thinking a great deal about which of these hints beyond the standard model physics

1024
01:48:38,240 --> 01:48:46,320
might be most promising. How would I go about the G-2 anomaly or the W anomaly or any of the

1025
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:53,600
other anomalies? What are the tools? The interstitial thing, as you were saying, in some sense,

1026
01:48:53,600 --> 01:49:00,640
new analysis of old data is new data of a kind because we have to process the original raw

1027
01:49:00,640 --> 01:49:08,400
data. It's never pristinely coming from the universe itself directly. What am I super excited

1028
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:17,520
about? I'm super excited about getting back to the big questions. We traded all of our big questions

1029
01:49:17,520 --> 01:49:21,920
for can you quantize gravity, which assumes that gravity wants to be quantized the way

1030
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:28,640
everything else wanted to be quantized. I'm tired of talking about white supremacy, but quantum

1031
01:49:28,640 --> 01:49:36,000
supremacy, we can call it quantum maximalism. It's sort of like dealing with Bitcoin maximalists.

1032
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:42,800
The people with the laser eyes are telling you quantize gravity rather than make the quantum

1033
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:48,560
more geometric because gravity has always been geometric since Einstein. What I'm super excited

1034
01:49:48,640 --> 01:49:56,320
about in mass is looking at the different ways that mass can be generated inside of the models.

1035
01:49:57,360 --> 01:50:02,160
Let's come up with three separate ways that you can generate mass. One way is that you could have

1036
01:50:02,160 --> 01:50:08,320
more things to differentiate. If a piece of a derivative gains mass by differentiating something

1037
01:50:08,320 --> 01:50:13,840
like a Higgs field, maybe there are multiple Higgs fields and the more mass somehow comes out of a

1038
01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:20,480
richer Higgs sector. That's one of the things that might be interesting. There's a very funny

1039
01:50:20,480 --> 01:50:26,000
result from dimension three. It's peculiar to dimension three called topological mass that was

1040
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:35,760
pioneered by Roman, Jacob and others. That says that if you have a Yang-Mills term, so forgive me,

1041
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:41,120
if you have a term that looks like this at the top of the cup with the double F's,

1042
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:50,720
and then you add another term that looks a little bit more like a matter equation. It's only got one

1043
01:50:50,720 --> 01:50:56,800
derivative rather than two, sort of like the Dirac equation. It's called the Churn-Simon's term.

1044
01:50:58,400 --> 01:51:03,520
In dimension three, that gives you a new way to generate mass that's not available elsewhere.

1045
01:51:04,480 --> 01:51:12,800
Then there's another way of generating mass, which is seemingly verboten, which is to put in a direct

1046
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:19,840
mass term for something like the W particle. Rather than a soft mass term, which gains the

1047
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:30,000
appearance of mass through an interaction. I'll stop using this mug. I believe that in GU there

1048
01:51:30,080 --> 01:51:36,160
are ways to generate mass directly rather than indirectly that don't violate gauge conservation.

1049
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:45,680
There are three mass mechanism channels that I'm looking at in GU relative to the discovery of

1050
01:51:45,680 --> 01:51:54,800
the W particle. This is something that I was excited about before, but I don't know. What are

1051
01:51:54,800 --> 01:52:00,080
you supposed to say? If everything is working fine, it was an embarrassment that there were these

1052
01:52:00,080 --> 01:52:06,560
extra terms. It's there in the draft. You can see where the mass is generated, but I don't think

1053
01:52:06,560 --> 01:52:13,920
actually I put in the Yang-Millsian part to the draft because of having something to do with the

1054
01:52:13,920 --> 01:52:22,560
Higgs sector, which I'm very excited about. The prospect for generating mass in novel ways,

1055
01:52:23,440 --> 01:52:27,760
I think, I expect to be one of the most exciting things to be coming out.

1056
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:34,800
Well, on that note, my friend, I want to wish everybody celebrating out there.

1057
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:40,160
Wait, wait, there was a guitar question. Oh yeah, a guitar question. So you made a guitar question.

1058
01:52:40,160 --> 01:52:51,280
Is the guitar hero dead? It's an interesting puzzle. We just had this dinner where I was

1059
01:52:51,280 --> 01:52:56,320
invited by a guy named Pliny. Yeah, talk about this picture. This guy tattooed everywhere except

1060
01:52:56,320 --> 01:53:02,080
for maybe the whites of his eyes. You're talking about Tim Henson. Oh yeah. Tim Henson is,

1061
01:53:03,200 --> 01:53:08,000
I don't even know how to describe what kind of a wild guitarist he is, but look up Polyphia Goat

1062
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:13,920
for the most famous thing that he did. I give the example. It's sort of like Havana Unana,

1063
01:53:14,480 --> 01:53:21,520
you know, but imagine that you had or like smooth. It's got this kind of a Latin

1064
01:53:23,280 --> 01:53:31,760
rhythm and feel of flow. But imagine that somebody was juggling a Faberge egg, a running chainsaw,

1065
01:53:31,760 --> 01:53:38,960
and a nuclear weapon. And like, it was just incredibly difficult to imagine the different

1066
01:53:38,960 --> 01:53:44,640
things that they had to do when they were catching each one of these things. Tim is mixing up all

1067
01:53:44,640 --> 01:53:54,160
sorts of ingenious, I just love this guy, ingenious ways of taking and deconstructing and

1068
01:53:54,160 --> 01:54:00,320
reconstructing. I want to emphasize reconstructing. Things that our brains and ears want to hear

1069
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:08,000
and are used to hearing, but need to be made fresh and new. So I think that Tim is one of the most

1070
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:13,520
exciting guitarists out there. But I want to just, I want to flog a bunch of names very quickly,

1071
01:54:13,520 --> 01:54:19,920
people who are exciting me. Pliny's exciting me. Rick Beato is doing amazing things on his channel.

1072
01:54:21,520 --> 01:54:28,800
We are being treated to Mike Dawes and Tommy Immanuel touring the country. Mike Isengur of

1073
01:54:28,800 --> 01:54:36,640
Incubus. John Mayer is one of the most unbelievable pedagogues out there. So he's not only playing

1074
01:54:36,640 --> 01:54:44,480
his heart out with the blues, with the level of people like Joe Bonamassa and other people in

1075
01:54:44,480 --> 01:54:53,760
that idiom guy named Kingfish and Eric Gales and Josh Smith. I'm just naming a bunch of people who,

1076
01:54:53,760 --> 01:54:59,360
if you're not, if you want to get excited again about guitar, listen to these people

1077
01:55:00,240 --> 01:55:10,240
as well as get excited about the gear. What's going on in gear? The folks at Positive Grid just

1078
01:55:10,240 --> 01:55:17,280
sent me a tiny amp that is effectively your charge. You know, it's a little cube, this big,

1079
01:55:17,280 --> 01:55:23,120
and I've got the world's greatest amplifier simulated inside of this tiny little thing.

1080
01:55:23,440 --> 01:55:31,040
What's going on at Neural DSP and their ability to simulate and capture instruments,

1081
01:55:31,040 --> 01:55:36,000
and then you can capture your own amplifier and digitize it.

1082
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:45,600
So Doug Castro is doing amazing things. The people at High Vibe Acoustic Guitar are blowing my mind

1083
01:55:45,600 --> 01:55:52,720
by putting reverb echo inside a classical instrument effectively, or a wood instrument.

1084
01:55:53,520 --> 01:56:00,640
This is out of France. And what they're doing is turning our, they're blurring the line between

1085
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:05,040
an electric and acoustic guitar. So you can have distortion on an acoustic guitar because

1086
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:11,520
it takes the signal in and then it transforms it and then it uses the vibrating wood, which is where

1087
01:56:11,520 --> 01:56:16,960
we hear most of the sound. It's not from the strings, it's from the wood. That stuff is being

1088
01:56:16,960 --> 01:56:24,320
vibrated by these little, I forget, actuators or whatever they could call them. I think guitar is

1089
01:56:24,320 --> 01:56:31,200
incredibly exciting right now, and I think that what we're missing is we're missing spontaneity

1090
01:56:31,200 --> 01:56:36,720
and the blues and whatever it is that caused every show to be wildly different. We have too many

1091
01:56:36,720 --> 01:56:44,560
people practicing very, very carefully. And I'll just shout out Tosin Abasi and Misha Mansour,

1092
01:56:44,560 --> 01:56:51,120
and I'm going to have more to say about this. Got it. Well, Eric, can't thank you enough.

1093
01:56:51,120 --> 01:56:56,160
People are asking you to break out a guitar, but I didn't ask you to plan that out. So unless you

1094
01:56:56,160 --> 01:57:01,280
happen to have a little strat nearby, we'll have to do that next time. And people are asking us to

1095
01:57:01,280 --> 01:57:07,040
go deep into the mug. So I think what we should do next time is explore the mug in some detail. So

1096
01:57:07,040 --> 01:57:12,720
on this channel. I would love to do that. But I would like to get some video aids, and the two

1097
01:57:12,720 --> 01:57:19,200
of us get excited about letting people know here's the recipe for the universe so that maybe not

1098
01:57:19,200 --> 01:57:24,320
everybody becomes a quantum field theorist instantly. But this is the greatest show on earth.

1099
01:57:24,320 --> 01:57:30,320
There's nothing more interesting than this. And you shouldn't get frozen out of it just because

1100
01:57:30,320 --> 01:57:33,680
you didn't math didn't agree with you in high school. So that's what I have to say.

1101
01:57:34,400 --> 01:57:40,080
That's right. So we tied in guitar strings and string theory. So Eric, we do have facilities

1102
01:57:40,080 --> 01:57:44,960
for that. We have an enormous green screen glass whiteboard down here at UC San Diego,

1103
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:50,320
where you're always welcome. You know where your office is and Japanese whiskey. We have Japanese

1104
01:57:50,320 --> 01:57:56,560
whiskey. We have Cuban cigars. We have giant mushrooms. And we have assorted accoutrements

1105
01:57:56,560 --> 01:58:01,760
to go along with that. I want to notify people next week, there's going to be a big press release

1106
01:58:01,760 --> 01:58:07,360
coming from the event horizon telescope, headed by my friend chef Doleman at Harvard Center for

1107
01:58:07,360 --> 01:58:12,800
Astrophysics. And they're making an announcement involving a black hole in the Milky Way Galaxy.

1108
01:58:12,800 --> 01:58:18,080
Now, I don't know about you, but I have a feeling it has to do with the ginormous six million solar

1109
01:58:18,080 --> 01:58:23,600
mass at the center of black hole, the black hole, the black hole unless they've discovered another

1110
01:58:23,600 --> 01:58:27,200
black hole. And that would be almost you don't know what this announcement is. Are you teasing us?

1111
01:58:27,200 --> 01:58:32,560
Do you actually know announcement of a press conference coming on Thursday next week, the 12th

1112
01:58:32,560 --> 01:58:41,920
of May? I have a video queued up. I've done an interview. I don't know. I have my very strong

1113
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:48,240
suspicions. And so I will have a video out that day about the results on this channel. So I hope

people will subscribe. I do a lot of introductory kind of physics videos, but I do a lot of advanced

1115
01:58:53,680 --> 01:58:58,720
physics and take the experimentalist tack. As Eric said, I love to go deep dive. I love my

1116
01:58:58,720 --> 01:59:03,280
theorist friends. My best friends are theorists, including Eric and Stefan. Would you want your

1117
01:59:03,280 --> 01:59:13,600
daughter to marry one? I would allow one of them. But in the same token. Experimentalists need some

1118
01:59:13,600 --> 01:59:19,200
love, too. The unsung exterminators of all theories in the universe. So for now, and I wish you all

1119
01:59:20,080 --> 01:59:26,640
a fruitful Cinco de Mayo. We're going to go out drinking next time we're together, some tequila,

1120
01:59:26,640 --> 01:59:34,320
and we'll have to avoid the anomalous worms. So I want to wish everybody that and tune in next

1121
01:59:34,320 --> 01:59:39,680
time to the Into the Impossible podcast with your fearful host, Dr. Brian Keating, and his

1122
01:59:39,680 --> 01:59:44,560
friendly friend, Eric. You're looking wonderful. Can't wait to we're in person and all seriousness.

1123
01:59:44,560 --> 01:59:50,560
Miss you, buddy. Been too long. All right, brother. Best to everybody. And I'll talk to you soon. Bye.

1124
01:59:50,560 --> 01:59:54,480
Thanks, friend.
