WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.360
Let's do it, as you see us on the screen.

00:02.360 --> 00:05.360
It's just going to be the center panel.

00:05.360 --> 00:05.860
Yep.

00:05.860 --> 00:06.840
All right.

00:06.840 --> 00:10.920
Welcome to a special episode of the Impossible

00:10.920 --> 00:14.320
Podcast, which is a series of great scholars

00:14.320 --> 00:17.520
that I have had on the podcast both multiple times now

00:17.520 --> 00:21.080
and green, Professor and colleague here at UC San Diego.

00:21.080 --> 00:24.080
And my friend, Longtime, most popular.

00:24.080 --> 00:26.960
I think that's a great connection.

00:26.960 --> 00:29.120
I'm at the portal podcast.

00:29.120 --> 00:34.560
And the physics who recently had a very, very popular episode

00:34.560 --> 00:37.480
said that we called physics is fine.

00:37.480 --> 00:39.640
And it was based on a Twitter thread

00:39.640 --> 00:43.800
storm that came out at the end of December in which Dan

00:43.800 --> 00:45.400
highlighted discoveries in physics

00:45.400 --> 00:48.280
that had not been really rewarded with the accolade

00:48.280 --> 00:51.360
of the Nobel Prize, yet, perhaps never,

00:51.360 --> 00:55.200
but at least as of the moment, had not been rewarded

00:55.480 --> 00:57.800
with that particular remuneration.

00:57.800 --> 01:00.720
And there's been a lot of controversy, as I said,

01:00.720 --> 01:04.920
around the description of physics as having stagnated.

01:04.920 --> 01:09.280
Most forcefully or vocally by Sabina Hossenfelder, also

01:09.280 --> 01:12.520
eight-time guest on the podcast, just behind Eric's record

01:12.520 --> 01:14.640
set for this particular event.

01:14.640 --> 01:17.440
But I wanted to have both gentlemen here together

01:17.440 --> 01:20.840
to discuss the future of physics as they see it

01:20.840 --> 01:23.680
and what's right with physics, what we could do with physics,

01:23.680 --> 01:25.600
or what we could change or modify,

01:25.600 --> 01:28.920
what opportunities there are, and sort of moderate that

01:28.920 --> 01:32.400
from the perspective of a simple experimental cosmologist

01:32.400 --> 01:34.280
and my perspective on things.

01:34.280 --> 01:36.800
So we're going to talk about particle physics,

01:36.800 --> 01:38.360
experiment theory.

01:38.360 --> 01:40.280
We're going to talk about unification of forces

01:40.280 --> 01:41.480
in fields, perhaps.

01:41.480 --> 01:45.400
And we're going to have it, as I said, a nice clean fight.

01:45.400 --> 01:48.120
We're going to go TOE to TOE.

01:48.120 --> 01:48.960
You did it.

01:48.960 --> 01:49.440
I did it.

01:49.440 --> 01:50.240
I made that joke.

01:50.240 --> 01:51.240
You didn't think I would.

01:51.280 --> 01:53.920
So I think I'll start with Dan, just

01:53.920 --> 01:57.160
to recapitulate from our previous episode that aired last week

01:57.160 --> 02:01.760
and find it, and the channel archives called Physics is Fine.

02:01.760 --> 02:05.800
What was the motivation for that particular tweet storm?

02:05.800 --> 02:07.840
Yeah, so thanks for having me on.

02:07.840 --> 02:10.680
It's nice to get a chance to talk to both of you.

02:10.680 --> 02:13.320
So the motivation behind the thread

02:13.320 --> 02:15.640
was to articulate some of the things

02:15.640 --> 02:20.320
that I picked up on being an active researcher that I thought

02:20.320 --> 02:24.400
were important events for me in understanding how the world works

02:24.400 --> 02:27.880
and making progress in clearly observational topics

02:27.880 --> 02:32.560
like cosmology, but also important theoretical ideas that

02:32.560 --> 02:35.160
had a huge impact on how I see the world that I didn't think

02:35.160 --> 02:39.400
were always well understood or appreciated by people,

02:39.400 --> 02:42.080
like even other researchers outside of their own fields.

02:42.080 --> 02:44.040
So it was just to kind of communicate

02:44.040 --> 02:46.360
the value of what had been happening.

02:46.360 --> 02:49.160
And one of the reasons for that is that as a researcher,

02:49.200 --> 02:53.120
it's really important to know what am I aiming for,

02:53.120 --> 02:56.640
like what would be a result that would really stand out

02:56.640 --> 02:59.320
amongst the best results the past five years.

02:59.320 --> 03:01.360
We'd all like to be Einstein, but just for me,

03:01.360 --> 03:04.600
I just you can't always, you won't always achieve those,

03:04.600 --> 03:08.560
but maybe having a hierarchy of results in your mind

03:08.560 --> 03:11.480
is really important for just gauging where progress,

03:11.480 --> 03:14.440
what counts as progress, what kind of progress is going on.

03:15.440 --> 03:20.200
And Eric, you've been interacting,

03:20.200 --> 03:24.400
you've been interacting and engaging with this said tweet

03:24.400 --> 03:27.160
and also with our friend Sabina and Martin Bauer,

03:27.160 --> 03:29.680
who generously provided a book called No Bell Dreams,

03:29.680 --> 03:31.320
which is somewhere around here.

03:31.320 --> 03:32.480
What was your reaction to this?

03:32.480 --> 03:35.760
You had sort of a provocative comment

03:35.760 --> 03:37.960
that we should just get past the point

03:37.960 --> 03:40.480
that yes, there's been a lot of progress in condensed matter

03:40.480 --> 03:42.840
physics and theoretical astrophysics,

03:42.840 --> 03:44.440
experimental cosmology.

03:44.440 --> 03:46.720
What are you most interested in doing

03:46.720 --> 03:49.600
to move the conversation forward from your perspective?

03:49.600 --> 03:50.680
Thanks for asking.

03:50.680 --> 03:55.040
So I'd like to do this in the click-baity kind

03:55.040 --> 03:56.760
of thumbnail sketches.

03:56.760 --> 04:00.320
I was outraged, Dan, frankly, by this tweet storm.

04:00.320 --> 04:03.760
Sorry, it's gonna get a little, a little, fantastic.

04:03.760 --> 04:05.840
I'm bored by all the opening moves.

04:05.840 --> 04:09.200
We have a suite of moves where somebody says

04:09.200 --> 04:10.800
there's a crisis in fundamental physics

04:10.800 --> 04:13.080
and then somebody mishears it and says,

04:13.080 --> 04:14.960
you have no idea what's going on in material science.

04:14.960 --> 04:16.360
It's never been a more exciting time.

04:16.360 --> 04:17.400
You say, that's not what I said.

04:17.400 --> 04:18.600
Well, who's to say what's fundamental?

04:18.600 --> 04:20.480
Is cosmology fundamental?

04:20.480 --> 04:23.200
So this is the sort of weird dance

04:23.200 --> 04:24.640
that people get into at the beginning.

04:24.640 --> 04:26.800
And I've said, I'd rather just say Roy Lopez's

04:26.800 --> 04:29.840
spasky variation and get to the middle game

04:29.840 --> 04:31.840
rather than wasting time on the intro.

04:31.840 --> 04:33.880
So I think it would be appropriate,

04:33.880 --> 04:37.640
given that I'm not a physicist, to seed a bunch of things,

04:37.640 --> 04:40.080
first of all, being that I'm not a physicist.

04:40.080 --> 04:44.920
I think that the issue is not about physics in the large.

04:44.920 --> 04:49.080
It's really about the sort of core central issue,

04:49.080 --> 04:50.880
which people are very squeamish about now,

04:50.880 --> 04:52.800
because nobody wants to say that any field

04:52.800 --> 04:54.280
is any more important than any other,

04:54.280 --> 04:55.840
which is ridiculous.

04:55.840 --> 04:58.660
There is a central core of fundamental physics,

04:58.660 --> 05:01.720
which is the thing that scratches the itch we have.

05:01.720 --> 05:03.380
When we're not physicists, we wanna know,

05:03.380 --> 05:04.220
what is the universe?

05:04.220 --> 05:05.200
Who am I?

05:05.200 --> 05:06.480
Where, why am I here?

05:06.480 --> 05:07.480
How does the world work?

05:07.480 --> 05:09.600
What is this place made of?

05:09.600 --> 05:12.480
And those questions have stagnated,

05:12.480 --> 05:15.240
and I'm sort of somewhat arbitrarily,

05:15.240 --> 05:16.400
but not that arbitrarily,

05:16.400 --> 05:19.440
tying that to February 1st of 1973

05:19.440 --> 05:23.240
with the publication of the Kobayashi-Moscowa paper,

05:23.240 --> 05:26.280
enlarging the Kibibo angle to three generations.

05:27.520 --> 05:32.480
And I believe there are eight particle theorists left

05:32.480 --> 05:34.360
on Earth who have won a Nobel Prize.

05:34.360 --> 05:37.480
Now that also causes a certain variation in the opening,

05:37.480 --> 05:38.680
because somebody will say, well,

05:38.720 --> 05:40.640
you seem to be very hung up on the Nobel Prize.

05:40.640 --> 05:41.480
It's like, no.

05:41.480 --> 05:42.320
Not more than me.

05:43.680 --> 05:47.800
But the fact is that the Nobel Prize

05:47.800 --> 05:51.480
is a somewhat conservative measure of progress.

05:51.480 --> 05:53.400
And as a conservative measure of progress,

05:53.400 --> 05:55.640
when you're down to your last eight people

05:55.640 --> 05:58.000
who have proven that they are physicists

05:58.000 --> 06:01.100
by being able to make contact with reality at that level,

06:02.560 --> 06:04.280
50 years is a long time.

06:04.280 --> 06:07.120
I think the longest recent drought of this kind

06:07.120 --> 06:11.600
is between 1928 and 47 with the advent of QED by Dirac

06:11.600 --> 06:13.720
as the first real quantum field theory

06:13.720 --> 06:16.840
before the sort of primitive renormalization program

06:16.840 --> 06:19.920
came in and cleared up the ability to compute.

06:19.920 --> 06:23.080
So I absolutely celebrate Dan's tweet storm.

06:23.080 --> 06:24.840
I think that it had lots of great papers,

06:24.840 --> 06:26.600
many of which I knew nothing about.

06:26.600 --> 06:29.000
So I educated myself and I got a chance

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
to look at Dan's work a bit.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.960
But that said, one of the things I think

06:34.960 --> 06:36.160
that tweet storm did,

06:36.200 --> 06:38.920
and I think Dan acknowledged it as much,

06:38.920 --> 06:43.920
is that it didn't clearly state the results

06:45.640 --> 06:48.560
that would constitute unambiguous change

06:48.560 --> 06:49.520
in fundamental physics.

06:49.520 --> 06:51.960
That is, what is the field content of the world?

06:51.960 --> 06:54.160
What stuff is it that's running around?

06:54.160 --> 06:56.760
Are there new things that we haven't figured out?

06:57.840 --> 07:00.040
What constitutes the new interactions

07:00.040 --> 07:01.200
of the stuff that we have

07:01.200 --> 07:02.500
and the stuff that may come to be?

07:02.500 --> 07:04.560
And the other issue of unification

07:05.560 --> 07:07.760
would be spaces.

07:07.760 --> 07:10.480
So we currently have something called space time

07:10.480 --> 07:12.320
and it's not clear whether there is a problem

07:12.320 --> 07:13.560
with space time itself.

07:13.560 --> 07:17.600
So I would say that Dan did a great service

07:17.600 --> 07:19.080
talking about all the sorts of things

07:19.080 --> 07:20.400
that are not in crisis.

07:20.400 --> 07:23.200
And I wish to seed instantly

07:23.200 --> 07:25.120
that it is not that physics is in crisis,

07:25.120 --> 07:27.800
which is the thing that everybody can understand easily,

07:27.800 --> 07:32.560
but it is the core central issue of what physics can be.

07:32.560 --> 07:34.680
It's meant to be that it excites our imaginations

07:34.680 --> 07:37.480
and our passions, answers philosophical questions

07:37.480 --> 07:39.760
that is in a prolonged state of,

07:39.760 --> 07:43.000
and I would say a necessary self-inflicted crisis.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.240
Well, just before Dan,

07:44.240 --> 07:45.720
you get the opportunity to address that.

07:45.720 --> 07:47.480
So I recently, are you familiar with this essay

07:47.480 --> 07:50.960
by David Foster Wallace called This Is Water?

07:50.960 --> 07:52.080
You're drinking some vodka,

07:52.080 --> 07:54.120
so hopefully you're familiar with it.

07:54.120 --> 07:57.280
So it's a parable of these two fish that are young fish

07:57.280 --> 07:59.280
and they're in the ocean, they're swimming around,

07:59.280 --> 08:01.480
and all of a sudden an older fish comes by

08:01.520 --> 08:04.040
and says, hey boys, how's the water?

08:04.040 --> 08:05.560
He goes on his way.

08:05.560 --> 08:07.520
And then the two fish look at each other,

08:07.520 --> 08:10.480
one says the other one, what the hell is water?

08:10.480 --> 08:11.520
Is that possible?

08:11.520 --> 08:14.080
Let me ask Dan, are we obsessed with space time?

08:14.080 --> 08:15.880
Are we in space time in the same way

08:15.880 --> 08:17.480
that these fish are in water?

08:17.480 --> 08:22.480
And are we rightfully to be maybe ashamed

08:22.600 --> 08:25.360
or view it as something to be dispensed with altogether

08:25.360 --> 08:28.040
as I think Einstein or Lorenz or both of them

08:28.040 --> 08:31.040
or neither of them or Nimas have claimed?

08:31.040 --> 08:31.880
What is space time?

08:31.880 --> 08:34.720
Why is that sort of the pinnacle

08:34.720 --> 08:37.160
and how can you see that getting under Eric's skin?

08:38.720 --> 08:40.120
Yeah, I mean, for sure,

08:40.120 --> 08:43.560
that's one of the great questions of science.

08:43.560 --> 08:48.360
So we think that space time probably emerges from something

08:48.360 --> 08:51.320
in a lot of examples we've studied like strength theory

08:51.320 --> 08:53.960
where our ultimate hope for resolution

08:53.960 --> 08:58.160
of the singularity at the beginning of time

08:58.160 --> 09:00.520
is probably something non-geometric.

09:00.520 --> 09:02.280
If we understand what's going on there,

09:02.280 --> 09:04.480
it will not be in terms of geometry

09:04.480 --> 09:07.840
at least of the kind of space time we experience.

09:08.680 --> 09:11.280
I think the thing I would say is in response to you,

09:11.280 --> 09:13.520
are we unnecessarily obsessed with it?

09:13.520 --> 09:16.600
I do think that there are questions of this nature,

09:16.600 --> 09:20.320
like what happened before the Big Bang?

09:20.320 --> 09:24.880
And some of those questions we don't have the tools to answer.

09:24.880 --> 09:26.760
We don't have data to help guide us.

09:26.760 --> 09:29.520
And even if someone writes down a theory that works,

09:30.040 --> 09:31.240
we may have no way to test it.

09:31.240 --> 09:32.680
Someone can come up with another theory.

09:32.680 --> 09:34.480
And so there is a lot of like,

09:34.480 --> 09:36.600
we're not guaranteed that we're gonna be able to answer

09:36.600 --> 09:40.560
all the questions that are deeply held questions

09:40.560 --> 09:43.120
of humanity going back to eons.

09:43.120 --> 09:45.320
But I do think that like,

09:45.320 --> 09:47.680
so there are aspects of these questions.

09:47.680 --> 09:50.120
I don't think we're guaranteed that we can make progress

09:50.120 --> 09:52.600
on all the questions we'd like to.

09:52.600 --> 09:57.440
And what happens at space time when it seems to be,

09:57.480 --> 10:00.360
but the kind of thing we experience on our scale,

10:00.360 --> 10:03.760
does it continue to exist down to these scales?

10:03.760 --> 10:05.320
We'd love to be able to answer that question,

10:05.320 --> 10:09.440
but I also don't think we necessarily are promised

10:09.440 --> 10:10.880
that we'll ever have answers,

10:10.880 --> 10:14.160
or at least in hundreds of years time scale.

10:14.160 --> 10:16.560
And so I don't see that as the benchmark

10:16.560 --> 10:19.200
at which all decisions of progress have to be made.

10:20.440 --> 10:23.760
You know, I guess when I hear that,

10:23.760 --> 10:26.120
I check it against things that I believe.

10:26.120 --> 10:28.760
So one, when you say geometric,

10:28.760 --> 10:30.360
it's not that it will be non-geometric,

10:30.360 --> 10:32.240
it's that it won't be the specific geometry

10:32.240 --> 10:35.080
and you sort of corrected that mid-flight.

10:35.080 --> 10:39.240
So if Albert Einstein told us to embrace

10:39.240 --> 10:40.840
semi-Romanian geometry,

10:40.840 --> 10:44.360
it's not simply going to be a semi-Romanian manifold,

10:44.360 --> 10:47.240
which is basically four degrees of freedom

10:47.240 --> 10:51.720
together with one set of rulers and four rulers

10:51.720 --> 10:54.440
for each degree of freedom and six protractors between them.

10:54.440 --> 10:58.240
So you have 10 variables that get chosen by an equation.

10:58.240 --> 11:00.000
And then that thing,

11:00.000 --> 11:02.680
to the extent that I understand your point,

11:02.680 --> 11:04.680
it's that there are these singularities.

11:04.680 --> 11:07.360
One is at the beginning of time, if you will,

11:07.360 --> 11:10.560
in the standard Friedman-Robertson-Walker model.

11:10.560 --> 11:14.000
And the other one is at the base of a black hole,

11:14.000 --> 11:15.960
which is the Schwarzschild singularity,

11:15.960 --> 11:17.960
and one modern interpretation

11:17.960 --> 11:20.880
is that the singularities result from crimes and sins

11:20.880 --> 11:22.840
that we don't even know we've committed.

11:22.840 --> 11:25.880
And so we're trying to figure out what to do as penance

11:25.880 --> 11:27.320
so as to remove these singularities.

11:27.320 --> 11:31.000
But if I listen to what you're saying very carefully,

11:31.000 --> 11:34.160
I see something which I'm very alarmed by,

11:34.160 --> 11:37.720
which is you're not suspicious,

11:37.720 --> 11:40.240
either one of you, enough of the language,

11:40.240 --> 11:43.800
before speaks to one dimension of time.

11:43.800 --> 11:49.440
And only R1 has an ordering in the absence of other structure.

11:49.440 --> 11:51.920
R2, R3, R4 don't have such a thing.

11:51.920 --> 11:53.920
So when there is an arrow of time,

11:53.920 --> 11:55.640
it makes good sense, ordinarily,

11:55.640 --> 12:00.120
to say nothing of pardon, to speak of before.

12:00.120 --> 12:03.720
But if the ultimate structure, as I believe,

12:03.720 --> 12:06.080
has multiple dimensions of time,

12:06.080 --> 12:10.520
you will find that the crutch of saying initial conditions

12:10.520 --> 12:14.040
has to be replaced by something like boundary conditions.

12:14.040 --> 12:15.600
And in such a situation,

12:15.600 --> 12:17.520
one of the things that's really interesting to me

12:17.520 --> 12:20.840
is that we have the Lagrangian, the equations,

12:20.840 --> 12:23.760
the field content, which is the science.

12:23.760 --> 12:26.920
But we also have this way of talking around it.

12:26.920 --> 12:29.040
And the way in which we have of talking around it

12:29.040 --> 12:31.440
carries a tremendous amount of weight.

12:31.440 --> 12:33.480
And a lot of that, I think,

12:33.480 --> 12:38.080
is grooving each generation to fail as its successors failed,

12:38.080 --> 12:39.840
because what we're doing is we're putting

12:39.840 --> 12:42.400
a tremendous amount of pressure saying,

12:42.400 --> 12:45.880
if you don't learn to speak the way we do,

12:45.880 --> 12:48.280
you will not be able to survive to adulthood

12:48.280 --> 12:51.200
to have your own thesis students.

12:51.200 --> 12:54.720
And therefore, you had better learn to talk as we do.

12:54.720 --> 12:56.080
And I think that that's one of the things

12:56.080 --> 12:57.360
that I'm very concerned about.

12:57.360 --> 12:58.960
I don't believe that before

12:58.960 --> 13:01.760
is as simple as we're making out to be.

13:01.760 --> 13:04.360
So I guess I would push back on that.

13:04.360 --> 13:06.520
I mean, I don't think it's, I mean,

13:06.520 --> 13:10.000
we can use, it's helpful to use everyday language

13:10.000 --> 13:13.040
and then add, okay, it could be different, right?

13:13.040 --> 13:17.040
Like, it's helpful to start from the things we know are true.

13:17.040 --> 13:18.560
And we can ask questions like,

13:18.560 --> 13:20.480
could there be extra dimensions of time

13:20.480 --> 13:24.040
or even just the evolution from is,

13:24.040 --> 13:25.560
do we know that quantum mechanics

13:25.560 --> 13:28.240
is the only possible way that the world could work?

13:28.240 --> 13:29.600
There are lots of people,

13:29.600 --> 13:31.200
and I include myself in them,

13:31.200 --> 13:33.760
that are interested in pushing the boundaries.

13:33.760 --> 13:38.400
But it also helps to start from a place of what we know.

13:38.400 --> 13:40.280
Like, I think there are plenty of people

13:40.280 --> 13:42.440
who throw away literally all the physics

13:42.440 --> 13:43.840
and they go, well, I don't wanna be constrained

13:43.840 --> 13:45.440
by the structures of physics.

13:45.440 --> 13:47.800
And it really hurts their careers

13:47.800 --> 13:49.160
because they can't,

13:49.160 --> 13:51.200
they don't even understand basic physics

13:51.200 --> 13:54.000
which stops them from being able to make meaningful progress.

13:54.000 --> 13:54.960
Because if you can't,

13:54.960 --> 13:57.620
if you can't explain what we already understand,

13:57.620 --> 14:00.880
you can't extend the structure in new and interesting ways.

14:00.880 --> 14:03.640
So with the example of multiple time directions,

14:03.640 --> 14:06.520
like people do consider this like in,

14:06.520 --> 14:10.320
you know, well-respected theoretical physics groups

14:10.320 --> 14:12.160
for many different motivations,

14:12.240 --> 14:15.720
either purely just as a tool to understand physics,

14:15.720 --> 14:17.080
but in other cases, really,

14:17.080 --> 14:18.400
because they're interested in like,

14:18.400 --> 14:20.760
what would it mean and what are the implications?

14:20.760 --> 14:24.240
But since we, like, all of our life experience

14:24.240 --> 14:25.760
is still rooted in one time,

14:25.760 --> 14:28.160
like I think it's still reasonable to say,

14:29.760 --> 14:31.140
for sure, you have to recover that.

14:31.140 --> 14:32.680
But at the same time, I don't think,

14:32.680 --> 14:36.160
like, I think it's good to establish that like,

14:36.160 --> 14:39.340
we have a language that works well

14:39.340 --> 14:42.000
for describing a lot of the universe

14:42.000 --> 14:45.280
and that we talk about how we break that,

14:45.280 --> 14:47.120
those things in a controlled way.

14:47.120 --> 14:51.560
So generalizations of say, like number of time dimensions

14:51.560 --> 14:53.760
or say changes to the rules even,

14:53.760 --> 14:55.480
so we're not even doing quantum mechanics,

14:55.480 --> 14:57.800
like those things are really interesting directions,

14:57.800 --> 14:59.120
but they're very constrained

14:59.120 --> 15:02.080
because most of them don't even describe daily life

15:02.080 --> 15:03.480
in any meaningful way.

15:03.480 --> 15:07.080
Like most mutations in biology lead to things

15:07.080 --> 15:08.920
getting far worse rather than better.

15:08.920 --> 15:10.880
It's a rare mutation that works.

15:10.880 --> 15:13.280
But what you've said is not actually true in science.

15:13.280 --> 15:16.520
It's often the case that people make huge breakthroughs

15:16.520 --> 15:18.720
because they don't understand the errors

15:18.720 --> 15:20.080
of a previous generation.

15:20.080 --> 15:23.440
So for example, you had the stray hydrogen atom

15:23.440 --> 15:25.720
on the nucleotides that was in all the books

15:25.720 --> 15:26.680
in the wrong place.

15:26.680 --> 15:29.200
It happened that Watson and Crick were in an office

15:29.200 --> 15:33.240
with Jerry Donahue who said, all the books are wrong.

15:33.240 --> 15:35.000
And if you look in the double helix,

15:35.000 --> 15:37.480
it's about a page and a half or something

15:37.480 --> 15:40.320
before Jim Watson figures out the hydrogen bonds

15:40.320 --> 15:44.280
that explain the Chargaff-Equimolar relations.

15:44.280 --> 15:46.920
And you have similar things if you were,

15:46.920 --> 15:49.840
in the 1940s, trying to study electromagnetism

15:49.840 --> 15:52.360
and its effect on electrons,

15:52.360 --> 15:53.640
you would almost certainly think

15:53.640 --> 15:55.640
that was the electric and magnetic fields

15:55.640 --> 15:59.280
that impacted an electron being passed around the solenoid.

15:59.280 --> 16:01.320
And surprisingly enough, in the 50s,

16:01.320 --> 16:03.600
we learned that there were classical consequences

16:03.600 --> 16:06.600
of electromagnetism that we had really wrong

16:06.600 --> 16:09.840
because we'd put all of our weight, if you will,

16:09.840 --> 16:12.640
on the E and B fields of electromagnetism

16:12.640 --> 16:15.120
and not on the electromagnetic four potential,

16:15.120 --> 16:17.280
which in fact is something,

16:17.280 --> 16:19.480
which is not a convenience product meant

16:19.480 --> 16:22.440
to recover classical electromagnetism.

16:22.440 --> 16:27.120
It in fact has weight, as was shown by Bohm and Aronov.

16:29.000 --> 16:33.440
I mean, I don't disagree with that point of view.

16:33.440 --> 16:36.400
I would just say that there's not,

16:36.400 --> 16:40.160
I don't think there's a lack of contrarianism in the field.

16:40.160 --> 16:41.960
And I don't think that that,

16:41.960 --> 16:44.400
I don't think there's people feel

16:44.400 --> 16:46.880
they're unable to take risks.

16:46.880 --> 16:49.440
I think the problem is that like,

16:49.440 --> 16:53.120
there's no, if you don't understand the starting point,

16:53.120 --> 16:55.360
it's very difficult to take risks

16:55.360 --> 16:57.880
that are in a productive way, right?

16:57.880 --> 17:01.560
So if I don't understand why we think the world,

17:01.560 --> 17:04.120
how the world works in this room,

17:04.120 --> 17:05.600
it's very difficult to think,

17:05.600 --> 17:06.960
well, what are the limitations

17:06.960 --> 17:10.240
of how I break the structures that I understand?

17:10.240 --> 17:12.560
So I would say, people understanding,

17:15.320 --> 17:18.080
trying to propose generalizations

17:18.080 --> 17:20.000
in all kinds of directions,

17:20.000 --> 17:22.320
almost all of them are doomed to fail from the start.

17:22.320 --> 17:25.000
And I think many people were like,

17:25.000 --> 17:28.800
well, that's people trying to put unnecessary constraints

17:28.800 --> 17:30.840
on me, I'm a free thinker.

17:30.840 --> 17:32.400
It's like, no, that's not people trying to put it.

17:32.400 --> 17:34.320
That's reality putting constraints on you.

17:34.320 --> 17:36.360
And I think that's, we have to separate,

17:36.360 --> 17:38.480
there's definitely sociological challenges

17:38.480 --> 17:40.840
for young people to do really creative things,

17:40.840 --> 17:42.280
but there's also just reality

17:42.280 --> 17:45.240
that presents a real challenge to being super creative.

17:45.240 --> 17:47.800
I just have a completely different impression

17:47.800 --> 17:50.880
of your field from outside, which is people come to me

17:50.880 --> 17:52.400
and they say, I can't afford to work

17:52.400 --> 17:54.480
on what I really wanna work on.

17:54.480 --> 17:55.920
I don't believe many of the things

17:55.920 --> 17:58.080
that I'm being fed with my mother's milk.

17:59.480 --> 18:01.160
I can understand them,

18:01.240 --> 18:04.520
but every time I deviate more than a certain amount

18:04.520 --> 18:07.640
or in a way that is not thought well of by the community,

18:07.640 --> 18:09.920
all conversations die off.

18:09.920 --> 18:12.480
I'm cautioned that this is an extremely brave thing to do

18:12.480 --> 18:15.720
in the sense of bravery is stupidity.

18:15.720 --> 18:19.040
And I think that what you're saying is a hope and a wish,

18:19.040 --> 18:21.520
which in a few cases,

18:21.520 --> 18:24.080
I don't wanna say that it's 100% across the board,

18:24.080 --> 18:26.000
but I do believe that in part,

18:27.360 --> 18:29.280
we don't have this freedom in this field

18:29.280 --> 18:31.000
and we don't have the freedom to continue

18:31.000 --> 18:32.840
to get engagement from the community

18:32.840 --> 18:34.360
because in general,

18:34.360 --> 18:36.960
we get these mega programs that are cropping up.

18:36.960 --> 18:38.160
And in the mega programs,

18:38.160 --> 18:39.560
there are all sorts of assumptions

18:39.560 --> 18:43.000
that have been layered on, which are not proven.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.520
And I would love to apply this rule

18:46.520 --> 18:49.840
to some of the major mega programs and say,

18:49.840 --> 18:51.840
hey, you're in the wrong number of dimensions,

18:51.840 --> 18:53.160
you've got the wrong signature,

18:53.160 --> 18:55.360
you've got the wrong symmetries,

18:55.360 --> 18:57.680
you've got the wrong field content.

18:57.680 --> 19:01.320
And it becomes this thing where the person then says,

19:01.320 --> 19:03.440
oh, no, no, no, it's a toy theory.

19:03.440 --> 19:06.240
I'm in a small Euclidean number of dimensions

19:06.240 --> 19:08.680
with SU2 is the symmetries of the universe.

19:08.680 --> 19:10.440
And I'm super symmetric.

19:10.440 --> 19:12.200
I'm doing all of this stuff,

19:12.200 --> 19:16.040
which is not the physical world that we live in

19:16.040 --> 19:18.040
so far as we understand it.

19:18.040 --> 19:19.920
And the idea is that that person is saying,

19:19.920 --> 19:24.000
I wish to suspend the normal rules of science

19:24.000 --> 19:26.520
because I'm doing toy stuff in order to learn

19:26.520 --> 19:29.480
about the structures that are going to elucidate

19:29.480 --> 19:32.320
the actual one physical universe that we're in.

19:32.320 --> 19:35.880
Now, when you do that, I understand that.

19:35.880 --> 19:37.920
But what we're talking about is something

19:37.920 --> 19:39.520
like scientific immunity.

19:39.520 --> 19:41.960
And if you've ever met somebody with diplomatic immunity,

19:41.960 --> 19:43.520
some of them have the feeling that they can park

19:43.520 --> 19:46.440
wherever they want to and they don't have to pay fines

19:46.440 --> 19:48.800
and that they're not subject to the laws of the land

19:48.800 --> 19:49.880
that they inhabit.

19:49.880 --> 19:51.640
And what I'm trying to say is,

19:51.640 --> 19:53.880
you cannot have these mega programs

19:54.880 --> 19:59.560
casually imposing the strictest expectations

19:59.560 --> 20:01.720
on its competitors and then giving itself

20:01.720 --> 20:04.400
a permanent free pass to go on for decades

20:04.400 --> 20:06.080
and decades about nothing.

20:06.080 --> 20:09.760
Well, just to push back with loving respect.

20:09.760 --> 20:12.480
Sorry, I have two actual physicists against one non-physicist.

20:12.480 --> 20:13.320
I like my own.

20:13.320 --> 20:15.560
I know, but you're an honorary physicist.

20:15.560 --> 20:16.400
I'm sorry.

20:16.400 --> 20:18.920
I'm sorry to tell you, you're an honorary physicist.

20:18.920 --> 20:21.800
So, you're taking basically the opposite point

20:21.800 --> 20:22.960
if I'm wrong, correct me,

20:23.160 --> 20:26.560
but of this guy up here, not Weinstein, but Einstein,

20:26.560 --> 20:28.680
who never thought any of his predictions

20:28.680 --> 20:31.040
would be verifiable and yet they proved

20:31.040 --> 20:35.320
to be very, very useful approximations, toy models.

20:35.320 --> 20:36.320
Look at the Schwartzschild.

20:36.320 --> 20:39.120
I mean, we already mentioned the Schwartzschild Singularity.

20:39.120 --> 20:41.960
That was thought to be completely impractical,

20:41.960 --> 20:43.240
never detectable.

20:43.240 --> 20:47.360
Einstein subsequently also disavowed the detectability

20:47.360 --> 20:49.680
of gravitational waves, gravitational lensing

20:49.680 --> 20:51.600
and yet it was remarkably prescient

20:51.600 --> 20:54.040
and that the toy model works in, you know,

20:54.040 --> 20:57.640
basically 99.999% of all situations

20:57.640 --> 20:59.280
where we could ever hope to apply it.

20:59.280 --> 21:01.440
So, toy models are extremely powerful

21:01.440 --> 21:03.600
and just to add on to that,

21:03.600 --> 21:05.360
you and I were talking before Dan came in

21:05.360 --> 21:08.120
about, you know, string theory in that very realm.

21:08.920 --> 21:11.400
You know, sometimes it is useful to take a,

21:11.400 --> 21:12.280
and again, I'm not speaking

21:12.280 --> 21:15.440
as a simple experimental cosmologist, not a theorist,

21:15.440 --> 21:17.440
but to take a toy model or take something

21:17.440 --> 21:20.120
that we know works in certain situations

21:20.120 --> 21:23.200
like the Klein-Gordon equation, which it doesn't apply,

21:23.200 --> 21:24.880
unless I'm wrong to any real particles,

21:24.880 --> 21:27.840
but it is useful to apply in a way

21:27.840 --> 21:29.600
of generating other solutions.

21:29.600 --> 21:32.080
Well, it sort of does with modifications.

21:32.080 --> 21:35.040
With an idealized modification.

21:35.040 --> 21:36.280
That's proving my point.

21:36.280 --> 21:37.120
It's a toy model.

21:37.120 --> 21:38.560
So what's wrong with toy models?

21:38.560 --> 21:39.680
We get a lot of mileage.

21:39.680 --> 21:40.840
Nothing is wrong with toy models.

21:40.840 --> 21:42.600
You're saying that you're being excluded

21:42.600 --> 21:44.840
or maybe not part of the physics program

21:44.840 --> 21:46.840
unless you engage in something that...

21:46.840 --> 21:49.360
I don't think that, this is just uncomfortable

21:49.360 --> 21:52.320
because it's like, let me begin by saying,

21:52.320 --> 21:55.320
string theory can't hurt anyone, right?

21:55.320 --> 21:57.720
There's, string theory is a set of ideas.

21:57.720 --> 22:00.000
It's a constellation of hypotheses

22:00.000 --> 22:01.320
and it's a place to play.

22:01.320 --> 22:02.440
There's nothing wrong with string theory

22:02.440 --> 22:04.200
nor loop quantum gravity.

22:04.200 --> 22:07.360
The problem is with, and I don't want to put it all

22:07.360 --> 22:08.320
on string theories.

22:08.320 --> 22:10.840
The problem is quantum gravity sociology,

22:10.840 --> 22:13.480
which has blown a physics-shaped hole

22:14.560 --> 22:18.280
in fundamental physics and replaced it

22:18.320 --> 22:20.320
with a set of double standards

22:20.320 --> 22:22.720
in which I want to know, what are the rules?

22:22.720 --> 22:25.280
If the rules are, we all get to play,

22:25.280 --> 22:28.000
then hot, hot diggity dog, let's all play.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.920
And if the rules are, we should be very careful

22:31.920 --> 22:33.320
that things agree with experiment

22:33.320 --> 22:35.920
in any attempt to talk about something

22:35.920 --> 22:38.920
as, that is violated, you know,

22:38.920 --> 22:41.040
like as soon as Dirac finds that A times B

22:41.040 --> 22:42.840
is not equal to B times A

22:42.840 --> 22:44.040
when he tries to take the square root

22:44.040 --> 22:47.320
of your Klein-Gordon equation, you know,

22:47.600 --> 22:49.040
it's a short period of time before he says,

22:49.040 --> 22:51.240
well, maybe A and B aren't numbers, they're matrices.

22:51.240 --> 22:53.320
And then it's like, okay, so you did something

22:53.320 --> 22:56.120
that was wrong, that didn't make any sense.

22:56.120 --> 22:58.440
And then it did make sense later.

22:58.440 --> 23:02.520
The problem that I have is that we have one set of players

23:02.520 --> 23:04.840
that is functioning in some sense

23:04.840 --> 23:06.680
as both the referees and a team.

23:06.680 --> 23:09.360
So imagine that you're playing in the NFL

23:09.360 --> 23:12.800
and you've got, the footlocker sends a team.

23:12.800 --> 23:14.200
So all their employees are dressed

23:14.200 --> 23:16.400
in vertical black and white stripes.

23:16.480 --> 23:18.600
And they take the field, they're not particularly talented,

23:18.600 --> 23:19.440
but the one thing that they have is-

23:19.440 --> 23:22.840
It could be worse than on Sunday's supermodel final call.

23:22.840 --> 23:25.680
What they do is that they start saying, you know,

23:25.680 --> 23:30.640
off sides, why do you guys get to do this?

23:30.640 --> 23:32.440
You're not, you're playing on the field,

23:32.440 --> 23:34.160
you're not in a position to do that.

23:34.160 --> 23:36.560
The problem is the cancerous sociology

23:36.560 --> 23:38.280
of quantum field theory,

23:38.280 --> 23:42.440
because this field is given excuses that the rest are not,

23:42.440 --> 23:47.440
and it imposes the most strict attempts to impose

23:47.800 --> 23:50.160
like scientific falsifiability.

23:50.160 --> 23:52.400
And to tell people that you're out, you're out, you're out.

23:52.400 --> 23:55.160
Well, 70 years later, after Bryce Dewitt

23:55.160 --> 23:59.120
enters an anti-gravity competition with his famous essay,

23:59.120 --> 24:02.320
we're still wrestling with a product that doesn't ship,

24:02.320 --> 24:04.480
which is imposing standards on other fields.

24:04.480 --> 24:07.360
And it's really important to blow that up in our lifetime

24:07.360 --> 24:08.800
so that we can all move forward together.

24:08.800 --> 24:11.160
So I actually celebrate what you're saying

24:11.160 --> 24:12.640
about toy models.

24:12.640 --> 24:14.920
I just wanna make sure that we don't have

24:14.920 --> 24:17.120
scientific immunity for quantum gravity.

24:17.120 --> 24:19.680
Well, I just wanna point out that Bryce Dewitt's book

24:19.680 --> 24:22.180
on anti-gravity is so engaging

24:22.180 --> 24:24.160
that you just can't put it down.

24:24.160 --> 24:27.720
Dan, I wanna ask you, are we having a discussion

24:27.720 --> 24:30.120
about sociology, or are we gonna talk about

24:30.120 --> 24:33.040
the actual ideas behind these issues?

24:33.040 --> 24:35.360
Because when you and I spoke, I said,

24:35.360 --> 24:37.120
when you guys get to, I don't know what you guys do

24:37.120 --> 24:39.120
over there in theory, but the bottom line,

24:39.160 --> 24:41.400
someone's gotta keep an eye on you.

24:41.400 --> 24:44.000
You know, we don't pick a person,

24:44.000 --> 24:46.600
we don't pick a field when we wanna hire a young professor.

24:46.600 --> 24:47.520
We want to hire you.

24:47.520 --> 24:49.080
I was part, you know, the milieu,

24:49.080 --> 24:50.400
I didn't actually, I wasn't on the committee,

24:50.400 --> 24:51.520
but it was part of that milieu.

24:51.520 --> 24:53.560
So I didn't say, oh, I really want someone who,

24:53.560 --> 24:55.800
you know, has worked on string theory causes.

24:55.800 --> 24:59.180
No, it's sort of a target of opportunity in some cases.

24:59.180 --> 25:01.080
We were stealing you away from another university.

25:01.080 --> 25:04.080
But the point is, is the sociology inside

25:04.080 --> 25:06.880
the host organism, or is it something that is perceived

25:06.880 --> 25:09.680
as being, afflicting it from outside, from an outside.

25:09.680 --> 25:12.520
So I'm gonna agree with Eric in some ways,

25:12.520 --> 25:15.960
and disagree in others, but let me, let me, let me,

25:15.960 --> 25:16.800
let's start with more,

25:16.800 --> 25:17.640
Must you agree?

25:17.640 --> 25:20.600
I'll start where we agree, which is like,

25:20.600 --> 25:23.700
so the problem when a field gets too big

25:23.700 --> 25:26.880
is that it doesn't have to refer outside, right?

25:26.880 --> 25:28.040
And that's, I think, what you're getting at,

25:28.040 --> 25:29.640
which is like, we make our own rules,

25:29.640 --> 25:32.520
we play by our own rules, and I never have to make contact

25:32.520 --> 25:34.840
with, not just with nature, but the rest of the world, right?

25:34.880 --> 25:37.960
I'm big enough, and you know, we can go to conferences

25:37.960 --> 25:40.400
with a thousand people, and never talk to anyone

25:40.400 --> 25:41.600
who's spoken a different language,

25:41.600 --> 25:43.240
or thought about another problem.

25:43.240 --> 25:47.400
So I think, I'm saying that because what I really see

25:47.400 --> 25:49.800
is makes the difference most of the time

25:49.800 --> 25:52.760
between the areas where the toy model makes progress,

25:52.760 --> 25:54.160
where the people working on the toy model

25:54.160 --> 25:56.880
really are meaningfully moving the field forward,

25:56.880 --> 26:00.400
is their ability to both what they're working on

26:00.400 --> 26:03.700
connects to other fields, but they're also able

26:03.740 --> 26:06.060
to understand what other fields need from them,

26:06.060 --> 26:08.140
and how their toy models are addressing that, right?

26:08.140 --> 26:11.300
So for someone working on, let's say,

26:11.300 --> 26:13.380
quantum field theory in two dimensions,

26:13.380 --> 26:16.660
like, you could do it in such a way that's like,

26:16.660 --> 26:19.140
why are these people wasting all their time?

26:19.140 --> 26:20.500
But then there are other people that are going,

26:20.500 --> 26:22.460
that were working on quantum field theory in two dimensions

26:22.460 --> 26:24.620
who were like, condensed matter physicists,

26:24.620 --> 26:26.780
and they were like, you know, no, we're working on this

26:26.780 --> 26:29.100
because these are solvable models of phase transitions

26:29.100 --> 26:30.380
that I can make in materia,

26:30.500 --> 26:34.460
and it's the ability to communicate outside of your area

26:34.460 --> 26:38.140
that's really important for the health of the health field,

26:38.140 --> 26:42.380
and to keep those toy models coming in contact with nature,

26:42.380 --> 26:43.220
right?

26:43.220 --> 26:44.060
If you're not interacting with the people

26:44.060 --> 26:47.660
for whom your toy model is supposed to be making contact,

26:47.660 --> 26:49.500
then it really is useless, right?

26:49.500 --> 26:51.900
If you're not, I mean, maybe it'll be useful eventually

26:51.900 --> 26:52.740
someone 100 years later.

26:52.740 --> 26:54.180
I don't think it's useless.

26:54.180 --> 26:59.060
But well, but I do think it's valuable to both parties,

26:59.060 --> 27:01.060
the people who are more in touch with nature

27:01.060 --> 27:03.340
and the people who are just trying to make progress

27:03.340 --> 27:06.260
to communicate with each other in a productive way.

27:06.260 --> 27:08.540
And where I'll agree with you is that,

27:08.540 --> 27:09.980
and I'm not just gonna say string theory,

27:09.980 --> 27:12.140
I think many fields reach a point

27:12.140 --> 27:14.140
that they're so self-sustaining

27:14.140 --> 27:17.260
that nobody in that field feels the need

27:17.260 --> 27:18.100
to talk outside of the field.

27:18.100 --> 27:20.220
I'm happy not to say string theory once

27:20.220 --> 27:21.060
for the rest of this.

27:21.060 --> 27:23.980
I wanna talk about quantum gravity as the problem,

27:23.980 --> 27:25.620
which subsumes string theory,

27:25.620 --> 27:27.460
and it doesn't point the finger at string theory

27:27.460 --> 27:28.300
in particular.

27:28.300 --> 27:29.620
But I would say, like again,

27:29.620 --> 27:32.900
and I would say it's true even in areas

27:32.900 --> 27:34.180
that are experimentally driven.

27:34.180 --> 27:37.380
Like this phenomena of a field becoming big enough

27:37.380 --> 27:41.260
that it does not have to refer to nature

27:41.260 --> 27:43.100
or progress or anything.

27:43.100 --> 27:45.760
And it's just, as long as we're making everyone

27:45.760 --> 27:46.760
in our community happy

27:46.760 --> 27:48.640
and we're all speaking the same language,

27:48.640 --> 27:49.620
then we're all doing fine.

27:49.620 --> 27:51.700
Are you a miserating other community?

27:51.700 --> 27:52.900
Am I?

27:52.900 --> 27:55.620
No, no, in these large programs,

27:55.620 --> 27:57.940
I'm even somewhat understanding

27:57.940 --> 28:01.420
if you guys wanna take some portion of the resources

28:01.420 --> 28:04.140
and go off into a cloistered monastery

28:04.140 --> 28:06.180
and talk to each other for 40 years,

28:06.180 --> 28:08.340
as long as it's not too much, that's fine.

28:08.340 --> 28:10.080
It's when you start telling other people

28:10.080 --> 28:11.900
that they're stupid,

28:11.900 --> 28:12.940
and when you just to say that,

28:12.940 --> 28:14.780
I don't know why anyone else works on anything else,

28:14.780 --> 28:15.820
that's dumb.

28:15.820 --> 28:17.940
And then you start talking about the fact

28:17.940 --> 28:22.940
that you play up all of your competitor fields' problems.

28:23.420 --> 28:26.220
You don't own your own.

28:26.220 --> 28:29.740
What you're talking about is sort of a scientific pathology

28:29.740 --> 28:31.380
and our discomfort,

28:31.380 --> 28:34.220
our discomfort in dealing with this phenomenon

28:34.220 --> 28:36.980
causes us to do proxy arguments.

28:36.980 --> 28:38.940
One proxy argument is quantum gravity.

28:38.940 --> 28:40.900
The problem with it is it doesn't make contact

28:40.900 --> 28:42.260
with experiment.

28:42.260 --> 28:43.580
Come on, right?

28:43.580 --> 28:44.900
Or it doesn't fit the scientific method.

28:44.900 --> 28:46.660
Oh, you're gonna repeat the big bang

28:46.660 --> 28:49.940
and just say you have large and give me a break, right?

28:49.940 --> 28:50.980
Another one is beauty.

28:50.980 --> 28:53.780
Sabina is very focused on beauty.

28:53.780 --> 28:57.060
Well, she's doing that in a way to avoid

28:57.060 --> 29:00.460
the head-on collision with what she's really trying to say.

29:00.460 --> 29:02.820
I'm not trying to avoid the head-on collision.

29:02.820 --> 29:05.860
What I'm trying to say is we cannot afford

29:05.860 --> 29:09.540
for an imperial culture to be telling other cultures

29:09.540 --> 29:12.020
that are trying to work on the same problems

29:12.020 --> 29:15.380
that they cannot exist because you've got everything wrapped

29:15.380 --> 29:18.780
up and literally we have a situation

29:18.820 --> 29:23.740
in which your colleague, David E. Kaplan,

29:23.740 --> 29:26.140
was recently featured in an interview

29:26.140 --> 29:27.980
where he just let loose.

29:27.980 --> 29:30.940
And I know David who did the film Particle Fever.

29:30.940 --> 29:32.980
And what he was talking about was the feeling

29:32.980 --> 29:35.700
that he was dumb and stupid and couldn't get something.

29:35.700 --> 29:38.940
We used to have a game called Tag War in my neighborhood.

29:38.940 --> 29:42.460
A new kid would come and we'd say, let's play Tag War.

29:42.460 --> 29:44.820
And they would try to figure out the rules of Tag War.

29:44.820 --> 29:47.300
More or less it was hazing and abuse.

29:47.300 --> 29:49.260
And after about two and a half, three weeks

29:49.260 --> 29:51.100
where we changed the rules over and over again

29:51.100 --> 29:53.980
so that it find the person, I don't understand the rules.

29:53.980 --> 29:55.100
It feels like there are no rules.

29:55.100 --> 29:56.700
That's when they became part of the neighborhood

29:56.700 --> 29:59.060
because it stood for the game without any rules.

29:59.060 --> 30:00.740
That was what Tag War meant.

30:00.740 --> 30:05.260
And my feeling about this is we have a Tag War problem

30:05.260 --> 30:08.780
coming out of quantum gravity that is stalling the core field

30:08.780 --> 30:11.340
that has to get addressed in the lifetime

30:11.340 --> 30:14.580
of the people who are still there who created the problem

30:14.580 --> 30:17.300
because good science requires that they go back

30:17.300 --> 30:19.700
to their statements where there are a lot of people

30:19.700 --> 30:20.780
who are no longer here.

30:20.780 --> 30:23.060
People who began their careers in the 1980s.

30:23.060 --> 30:26.500
How old were you during the anomaly cancellation, 1984?

30:26.500 --> 30:27.340
Two years old.

30:27.340 --> 30:28.580
There you go.

30:28.580 --> 30:30.660
You have no idea what it was like.

30:30.660 --> 30:33.660
And you can read about it, but the fact of the matter is

30:33.660 --> 30:36.500
it was an absolutely brutal thing.

30:36.500 --> 30:38.780
And Brian Greene and I had been having a back and forth

30:38.780 --> 30:39.620
about this.

30:39.620 --> 30:41.740
He got asked on Kurt Geimungal's program

30:41.740 --> 30:44.180
about what are these issues that people keep talking about?

30:44.180 --> 30:46.460
And he said, oh, well, we were very enthusiastic.

30:46.460 --> 30:48.900
And I heard you say this thing about particle theorists

30:48.900 --> 30:50.140
are like bosons.

30:50.140 --> 30:53.060
They all line up and sort of find the same things interesting.

30:53.060 --> 30:53.820
No.

30:53.820 --> 30:56.980
North Koreans line up and find the same things interesting.

30:56.980 --> 31:00.580
Iraqis under Saddam Hussein all voted the same way.

31:00.580 --> 31:03.540
You have a problem which is why they're behaving like bosons

31:03.540 --> 31:04.660
rather than fermions.

31:04.660 --> 31:07.860
And why the fermions are being, evolutionary theory

31:07.860 --> 31:10.500
has a concept called interference competition,

31:10.500 --> 31:13.780
where if you have one animal that tries to keep another animal

31:13.780 --> 31:16.340
from being able to get to the salt lick or the water

31:16.340 --> 31:19.220
or the food, and then other animal that's being kept from that

31:19.220 --> 31:20.100
dies off.

31:20.100 --> 31:22.380
And that's how we've lost these people.

31:22.380 --> 31:24.780
There are so many theories and interesting people

31:24.780 --> 31:28.020
who are no longer with us because of this mad grab

31:28.020 --> 31:31.020
for resources quoting something like white man's burden.

31:31.020 --> 31:32.820
Manifest destinies.

31:32.820 --> 31:36.380
It is our manifest destiny to change the problem.

31:36.380 --> 31:38.700
We used to have a concept called unified field theory

31:38.700 --> 31:40.060
or unification.

31:40.060 --> 31:40.740
That went away.

31:40.780 --> 31:43.780
And it got supplanted by something called quantum gravity.

31:43.780 --> 31:45.540
And that became the thing that got rolled out

31:45.540 --> 31:47.620
through Dennis Overby in the New York Times, repeated

31:47.620 --> 31:51.340
in Science Magazine ad nauseam, until everyone

31:51.340 --> 31:54.740
was brainwashed thinking, the problem of our time

31:54.740 --> 31:56.220
is quantum gravity.

31:56.220 --> 31:59.140
And it's not.

31:59.140 --> 32:01.820
I mean, are you saying we need literal tribunals

32:01.820 --> 32:04.500
to get Edward Whitton and Pulchinsk?

32:04.500 --> 32:05.900
Well, we can't get Pulchinsk anymore.

32:05.900 --> 32:08.060
But what is it?

32:08.060 --> 32:09.100
What's really bothering you?

32:09.140 --> 32:12.260
I understand that these are challenges.

32:12.260 --> 32:13.980
It's frustrating to have a field that's

32:13.980 --> 32:17.420
had, from one perspective, a lack of progress,

32:17.420 --> 32:19.380
but entrenched because of the prestige

32:19.380 --> 32:20.940
of the previous practitioners.

32:20.940 --> 32:22.860
But again, I'd like to point this out.

32:22.860 --> 32:25.100
In 1859, there was a very bright guy

32:25.100 --> 32:27.780
by the name of James Clerk Maxwell, who worked very hard

32:27.780 --> 32:30.340
and had a successful model of electromagnetic wave

32:30.340 --> 32:32.900
propagation that, in the sense that it predicted

32:32.900 --> 32:34.220
experimental observables.

32:34.220 --> 32:36.580
But it was based on whirlpools and eddies

32:36.980 --> 32:39.180
and all sorts of other things to substantiate

32:39.180 --> 32:41.260
an ether-like material.

32:41.260 --> 32:43.460
So he was right for the wrong reasons

32:43.460 --> 32:45.460
or wrong for the right reason, Galileo, same thing.

32:45.460 --> 32:48.020
He thought the tides were caused by the Earth's rotation.

32:48.020 --> 32:49.220
They're really caused by the moon.

32:49.220 --> 32:52.380
So in other words, why is it so important that we punish

32:52.380 --> 32:52.860
Edward Whitton?

32:52.860 --> 32:53.740
I mean, I would like to be.

32:53.740 --> 32:54.700
It's not a question of punishment.

32:54.700 --> 32:56.300
Maybe Edward Whitton has something

32:56.300 --> 32:58.220
to say about this behavior.

32:58.220 --> 33:01.180
And I would love to hear, Cumran and Brian Green

33:01.180 --> 33:08.020
and Lenny Susskin, as well as Natty Cyberg and Eva Silverstein.

33:08.020 --> 33:12.420
It would be great to have these people in a dialogue.

33:12.420 --> 33:13.740
Natty Cyberg said something.

33:13.740 --> 33:15.860
He said, string theorists are very arrogant.

33:15.860 --> 33:17.340
If somebody comes up with something

33:17.340 --> 33:18.980
that makes progress that isn't string theory,

33:18.980 --> 33:21.140
we'll just say it's string theory.

33:21.140 --> 33:25.220
And I'm like, no.

33:25.220 --> 33:27.540
There's a concept called mustn't.

33:27.540 --> 33:29.580
You don't get to do that stuff.

33:29.660 --> 33:32.420
You're in the wrong field, if that's how you feel.

33:32.420 --> 33:34.860
And I know, Natty, we have a cordial relationship.

33:37.980 --> 33:39.980
You don't get to play that way.

33:39.980 --> 33:41.900
You don't get to call people stupid unless you're

33:41.900 --> 33:45.140
going to back it up, or it can come back at you.

33:45.140 --> 33:47.780
I mean, I would be happy to talk to Lenny Susskin

33:47.780 --> 33:49.420
and talk to him about all the people he's

33:49.420 --> 33:52.100
insulted over the years, because he's so very open about it.

33:52.100 --> 33:53.580
He's not hiding it.

33:53.580 --> 33:55.340
Just say, you're an old man.

33:55.340 --> 33:56.780
You're at the end of your career.

33:56.780 --> 33:58.340
How to go?

33:58.380 --> 34:00.500
What happened?

34:00.500 --> 34:02.860
Did you make the progress that your friend Feynman made,

34:02.860 --> 34:04.420
or Murray Gelman, or any of the people

34:04.420 --> 34:06.180
that you knew from a previous era?

34:06.180 --> 34:07.940
Am I feeling about this?

34:07.940 --> 34:08.420
Pardon me?

34:08.420 --> 34:09.820
That's a very high standard.

34:09.820 --> 34:13.300
Let's talk about the A team, the Institute for Advanced Study.

34:13.300 --> 34:16.260
At some point recently, had Robert Dycraft, a string

34:16.260 --> 34:20.620
theorist as its director, Natty Cyberg, a string theorist,

34:20.620 --> 34:24.380
Edward Whitten, Juan Maldesena, and then

34:24.380 --> 34:28.420
Nima was sort of off a little bit in necessarily

34:28.420 --> 34:29.860
quantum gravity.

34:29.860 --> 34:35.780
That's an enormous investment in quantum gravity.

34:35.780 --> 34:37.900
And the problem that I'm having with this

34:37.900 --> 34:43.020
is Dan Friedan, a prominent quantum gravity researcher,

34:43.020 --> 34:45.540
talked about this openly, said science only

34:45.540 --> 34:48.660
works when we actually go back and look

34:48.660 --> 34:52.740
at how we've behaved and confront our own failures.

34:52.780 --> 34:54.980
This is the same thing with the bootstrap method.

34:54.980 --> 34:56.500
I feel like what we're doing is we're

34:56.500 --> 34:58.740
living the Jeffrey Chu nightmare all over again.

34:58.740 --> 35:00.340
Do you feel like that's the challenge

35:00.340 --> 35:01.780
that we're facing in the theoretical?

35:01.780 --> 35:04.820
Well, I'd first like to just, I think

35:04.820 --> 35:07.660
we can agree that there can be sociology problems.

35:07.660 --> 35:10.740
But I would also say, as a young person,

35:10.740 --> 35:14.500
I find the same level of saying that there's

35:14.500 --> 35:16.620
been no progress in physics.

35:16.620 --> 35:19.980
It's insulting to young people who are not part of this,

35:19.980 --> 35:21.820
who feel like we're making real progress,

35:21.860 --> 35:25.060
who see real progress happening, and to say,

35:25.060 --> 35:27.420
but at the same time, if you're going back

35:27.420 --> 35:31.460
to a much older generation, and you're saying,

35:31.460 --> 35:33.260
and we're painting everyone who's come back

35:33.260 --> 35:36.540
in the past 40 years as being complicit with this,

35:36.540 --> 35:38.180
and we can't think for ourselves,

35:38.180 --> 35:39.540
and we're being influenced by it,

35:39.540 --> 35:42.380
and it doesn't make it easier for us to go off,

35:42.380 --> 35:45.100
to just say we've made no progress.

35:45.100 --> 35:47.100
Doesn't help it easier.

35:47.100 --> 35:49.220
But that's a total mischaracter.

35:49.220 --> 35:51.520
I mean, I've never said anything so simplistic

35:51.520 --> 35:52.600
in my life.

35:52.600 --> 35:54.880
What I've said is, when you try to say

35:54.880 --> 35:56.880
that you're going to quantize gravity,

35:56.880 --> 35:59.600
what you're talking about is quantizing geometry.

35:59.600 --> 36:02.920
And what happened was the most romantic backfire possible

36:02.920 --> 36:05.840
in the sciences is that you instead geometrized

36:05.840 --> 36:08.880
the quantum, and the great legacy of these people

36:08.880 --> 36:11.040
is that they figured out that quantum field theory

36:11.040 --> 36:13.600
really has nothing to do with physics.

36:13.600 --> 36:16.280
Physics, as we understand it, the physical world

36:16.280 --> 36:19.080
is one input to the quantum field theory machine.

36:19.080 --> 36:22.000
Quantum field theory is really about waves on waves.

36:22.000 --> 36:23.760
And that happens in cowardism theorem

36:23.760 --> 36:25.160
and algebraic topology.

36:26.040 --> 36:28.440
It happens in conformal theory that has nothing to do

36:28.440 --> 36:32.280
with the physical dimensions and realms.

36:32.280 --> 36:34.480
What we found out was fascinating

36:34.480 --> 36:36.120
because in fact, it backfired.

36:36.120 --> 36:38.200
And there's nobody who would like to celebrate

36:38.200 --> 36:43.200
all the good that Digraph and Natty and Ed and Company did

36:44.360 --> 36:47.640
in this story, including the celebration of the toy models.

36:47.640 --> 36:52.480
The problem that I'm having is that they reordered the field.

36:52.480 --> 36:56.880
I mean, this is a book that I keep very close to me

36:57.760 --> 37:00.080
because it's a conference that happened

37:00.080 --> 37:04.320
at the exact moment before the anomaly cancellation.

37:04.320 --> 37:07.880
And Murray Gelman gave a keynote address

37:07.880 --> 37:10.800
at Shelter Island 2, the conference that was supposed

37:10.800 --> 37:12.920
to recapitulate the 1947 conference

37:12.920 --> 37:14.840
that got physics back on track.

37:14.840 --> 37:17.480
So they're trying to get back the magic.

37:17.480 --> 37:19.760
He says, as usual, solving the problems of one era

37:19.760 --> 37:22.160
has shown up the critical questions of the next.

37:22.160 --> 37:23.640
The very first ones that come to mind

37:23.640 --> 37:25.080
looking at the standard theory of today.

37:25.080 --> 37:27.080
He's talking about the standard model.

37:28.480 --> 37:30.440
Why this particular structure for the families

37:30.440 --> 37:31.840
and particular why flavor chiral

37:31.840 --> 37:33.080
with left and right-handed particles

37:33.080 --> 37:34.000
being treated differently?

37:34.000 --> 37:34.960
Why three families?

37:34.960 --> 37:38.080
That's a generalization of Robbie's famous question.

37:38.080 --> 37:41.840
How many sets of Higgs bosons are there in the standard theory?

37:41.840 --> 37:44.360
And why SU3 cross SU2 cross U1?

37:44.360 --> 37:45.720
Why those symmetries?

37:45.720 --> 37:50.480
Now, in all of those cases, those are classical questions.

37:50.480 --> 37:52.560
And what you see and the reason that it's important

37:52.560 --> 37:54.840
that your generation know its history

37:54.840 --> 37:58.560
is that one of the things that happens in marketing

37:58.560 --> 38:02.600
is that you have a product and you have to create a problem

38:02.600 --> 38:05.680
so that your product fills that hole, right?

38:05.680 --> 38:08.040
And this is what happens with the 76 trombones

38:08.040 --> 38:09.560
in the Music Man, right?

38:09.560 --> 38:13.840
You've got a problem in its pool and the solution is music.

38:13.840 --> 38:18.440
And okay, what these people did to the field

38:18.440 --> 38:20.360
was that they reordered our concept

38:20.360 --> 38:22.760
of what our principal problems were

38:22.760 --> 38:24.400
around the problems that they thought

38:24.400 --> 38:26.800
they were most likely to solve.

38:26.800 --> 38:30.320
And I don't need them to be in pain.

38:30.320 --> 38:33.360
I don't want to see particularly vindictive.

38:33.360 --> 38:36.000
But what I do want to see is tell me about all the people

38:36.000 --> 38:38.640
whose careers were terminated during this.

38:38.640 --> 38:40.560
Tell me what they were working on.

38:40.560 --> 38:41.600
Should we have them back?

38:41.600 --> 38:43.800
Should we have conferences devoted

38:43.800 --> 38:47.440
to what if quantum gravity doesn't exist?

38:47.440 --> 38:48.640
Shall we actually ask,

38:48.640 --> 38:50.880
because what you talked about with heterodoxy

38:50.880 --> 38:55.200
is that you're usually talking about orthodoxy plus epsilon.

38:55.200 --> 38:57.600
I'm gonna go out in the limb and say sterile neutrino.

38:57.600 --> 38:59.800
Well, that's not really very heterodox.

38:59.800 --> 39:00.960
And then maybe you go a little bit,

39:00.960 --> 39:02.640
I'm gonna say that there are multiple axions

39:02.640 --> 39:04.240
to solve the strong CP problem

39:04.240 --> 39:06.800
plus create cosmic birefring.

39:06.800 --> 39:08.480
Whatever these things are,

39:09.480 --> 39:13.080
they're not really what we're talking about

39:13.080 --> 39:14.560
in terms of heterodoxy.

39:14.560 --> 39:19.400
And it's very important to either impose these rules

39:19.400 --> 39:20.720
on this group of people

39:20.720 --> 39:22.440
or to relax the rules for other people

39:22.440 --> 39:24.840
so that we can have truly different ideas

39:24.840 --> 39:27.280
because I think that we will probably find

39:27.280 --> 39:28.680
that over the last 50 years,

39:28.680 --> 39:31.760
there were many ideas that will fall into the final theory

39:31.760 --> 39:35.120
that were pushed aside into the dustbin by this group.

39:35.120 --> 39:36.720
I mean, again, I wanna take it back

39:37.320 --> 39:40.080
what I think is certainly not to invalidate

39:40.080 --> 39:41.080
anything you've said, Eric,

39:41.080 --> 39:44.800
but I think that that might be parochial to the extent

39:44.800 --> 39:47.560
that it may involve certain members of the community

39:47.560 --> 39:50.360
who aren't affiliated with these three-letter organizations

39:50.360 --> 39:54.960
like IAS or MIT or whatever, NSA.

39:54.960 --> 39:56.880
But I think what's more interesting,

39:56.880 --> 39:59.200
and Dan is free to apply in any way he likes

39:59.200 --> 40:00.120
and respond to you,

40:00.120 --> 40:03.360
but the point I think is how many flowers

40:03.360 --> 40:04.560
should be blooming right now?

40:04.600 --> 40:07.440
I mean, you mentioned a couple of different alternatives,

40:07.440 --> 40:10.160
a loop on gravity and other things.

40:10.160 --> 40:13.120
At what point would you have to say

40:13.120 --> 40:15.800
the portfolio should be fully diversified

40:15.800 --> 40:17.480
and that we should actually devote

40:17.480 --> 40:19.600
equal amounts of attention?

40:19.600 --> 40:20.600
Oh, nobody's saying that, Brian.

40:20.600 --> 40:22.160
Right, but now you're saying,

40:22.160 --> 40:24.720
well, we should hold these people to account.

40:24.720 --> 40:27.240
Well, first of all, correct me if I'm wrong,

40:27.240 --> 40:29.000
but I don't think Edward Whitton's published something

40:29.000 --> 40:30.520
on string theory in a decade.

40:30.520 --> 40:32.040
I mean, the last thing I saw is that he wants us

40:32.040 --> 40:33.320
to go visit a black hole

40:33.360 --> 40:35.120
to see if there's a one microsecond time delay

40:35.120 --> 40:38.440
at the end edge of 5AU or something like that.

40:38.440 --> 40:41.200
I don't know to what extent he's still holding sway

40:41.200 --> 40:42.960
over the field that you're in.

40:42.960 --> 40:44.680
Eva is actually much, much younger.

40:44.680 --> 40:45.720
What did Coomron say?

40:45.720 --> 40:47.080
What did Coomron say?

40:47.080 --> 40:49.040
He was on the podcast two years ago

40:49.040 --> 40:51.200
and I confronted him as all podcasts are legal,

40:51.200 --> 40:53.400
podcasters are legally obligated to do.

40:53.400 --> 40:54.960
And I said, what about this claim

40:54.960 --> 40:58.880
that there's been no experimentally falsifiable things

40:58.880 --> 41:00.800
predicted by string theory?

41:00.800 --> 41:01.880
He said, oh, no, no, you're wrong.

41:01.880 --> 41:03.840
And you couldn't go back and see this episode.

41:03.840 --> 41:06.400
But didn't you ask about what he wanted on his tombstone?

41:06.400 --> 41:07.840
Oh, what he wanted on his tombstone?

41:07.840 --> 41:12.080
Yeah, that and Michio Kaku, very similar answers.

41:12.080 --> 41:13.560
The equations of string theory, right?

41:13.560 --> 41:17.160
So, but let me just, one thing that he did say is,

41:17.160 --> 41:18.080
well, no, it's not true.

41:18.080 --> 41:20.200
String theory does predict the mass of the electron

41:20.200 --> 41:23.640
shall be between 10 to the minus 35 plank masses

41:23.640 --> 41:25.660
and 10 to the minus one plank masses.

41:25.660 --> 41:26.760
And yeah, that sounds all funny.

41:26.760 --> 41:27.880
We can laugh about it.

41:27.880 --> 41:32.200
You know, in logarithmic space, it's not terrible.

41:32.200 --> 41:34.520
I guess the point being, to what extent

41:34.520 --> 41:36.000
we're something like loop quantum gravity,

41:36.000 --> 41:38.600
which many people, including my friend Carla Revelli

41:38.600 --> 41:40.680
has been on the podcast many times,

41:40.680 --> 41:42.280
he has said that, yeah, there are challenges.

41:42.280 --> 41:44.280
There are experimental falsifications

41:44.280 --> 41:46.640
of some of the claims of loop quantum gravity,

41:46.640 --> 41:49.560
in particular for propagation of velocity

41:49.560 --> 41:52.600
versus electromagnetic frequency of distant quasars.

41:52.600 --> 41:54.680
But the point I guess I'm trying to make is,

41:54.680 --> 41:58.000
if you are the director of the IAS, you clean house,

41:59.280 --> 42:02.000
is it really, I mean, would string theory have,

42:02.000 --> 42:03.400
just yes or no, simply yes or no,

42:03.400 --> 42:04.640
would string theory have a place

42:04.640 --> 42:06.160
and then would loop quantum gravity have a place

42:06.160 --> 42:09.040
and then would geometric unity have the primary position?

42:09.040 --> 42:11.360
I don't think we need to worry about permanent positions.

42:11.360 --> 42:12.840
I think that the key issue, I mean,

42:12.840 --> 42:15.040
let me just say some things people won't associate with me.

42:15.040 --> 42:17.680
In general, string theorist,

42:19.640 --> 42:21.680
part of the quantum graph, I have to use string theory there

42:21.680 --> 42:26.680
because they're smarter and that's uncomfortable.

42:28.080 --> 42:29.880
But they're really, really smart

42:29.880 --> 42:32.480
and they're really, really good at quantum field theory.

42:32.480 --> 42:35.800
And I see that and I'm happy about that.

42:35.800 --> 42:39.520
What's more, many of them are really good at geometry.

42:39.520 --> 42:41.680
And it's incredibly impressive.

42:41.680 --> 42:44.560
And I think that it does wonderful things for the field

42:44.560 --> 42:47.960
to have progress going on in the gym on the treadmill

42:47.960 --> 42:50.000
when you're not actually running a marathon.

42:50.000 --> 42:53.960
So in a certain sense, in that particular sub-community,

42:53.960 --> 42:55.280
people are in extremely good shape.

42:55.280 --> 42:57.920
The generals have been playing war games for 50 years

42:57.920 --> 42:59.960
because there were no war games to fight.

42:59.960 --> 43:02.040
They have a distorted sense of what being a general

43:02.040 --> 43:04.560
actually is because they haven't seen action.

43:04.560 --> 43:09.560
But I would never want these people driven out of the field.

43:09.920 --> 43:12.920
I don't know anyone I praise as much as Edward Whitten

43:12.920 --> 43:15.760
for his contributions principally to geometry

43:15.760 --> 43:17.640
and to the structure of quantum field theory,

43:17.680 --> 43:18.880
although not the quantum field theory

43:18.880 --> 43:20.480
that we seem to live with it.

43:20.480 --> 43:23.320
So I don't think that that's really the argument

43:23.320 --> 43:24.160
that I'm making.

43:24.160 --> 43:25.720
And I think that part of the problem is that

43:25.720 --> 43:28.120
this is a very clickbait thing about, you know,

43:28.120 --> 43:30.680
string theory is BS versus no string theory,

43:30.680 --> 43:32.680
the power and the glory of string theory.

43:32.680 --> 43:34.880
It's of no interest to anyone.

43:34.880 --> 43:36.600
What you said about loop quantum gravity

43:36.600 --> 43:37.440
that was interesting.

43:37.440 --> 43:39.720
I asked Lee Smolen about this, who's a friend.

43:39.720 --> 43:41.880
He says, yeah, the original hope

43:41.880 --> 43:43.720
for loop quantum gravity is not realized

43:43.720 --> 43:45.920
without other ideas, this does not work.

43:45.920 --> 43:46.760
It doesn't carry the day

43:46.760 --> 43:49.000
and it doesn't behave as expected.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.480
Now say what you want about Lee Smolen,

43:51.480 --> 43:53.840
and I'll be honest, a lot of people

43:53.840 --> 43:55.920
in that other community in quantum gravity

43:55.920 --> 43:59.240
say incredibly negative things about Lee Smolen,

43:59.240 --> 44:01.680
but he behaved properly.

44:01.680 --> 44:03.400
There's no need for a tribunal

44:03.400 --> 44:06.600
when a leader of the field says, you know what?

44:06.600 --> 44:10.480
We were exuberant and they were exuberant.

44:10.480 --> 44:12.480
We were optimistic, they were optimistic,

44:12.480 --> 44:16.160
but they didn't go about with this manifest destiny nonsense

44:16.160 --> 44:18.800
and they can reflect and say, you know what?

44:18.800 --> 44:20.680
It doesn't work the way we thought

44:20.680 --> 44:23.360
or we can't get fermions into the theory comfortably

44:23.360 --> 44:24.560
or something like that.

44:24.560 --> 44:27.640
And I really think that we have to understand the difference

44:27.640 --> 44:29.400
that the ethics of loop quantum gravity

44:29.400 --> 44:33.720
are much better than the ethics in its competitor.

44:33.720 --> 44:38.760
Well, I think where I push back is just,

44:38.760 --> 44:41.040
I think you're often identifying

44:41.040 --> 44:42.480
understanding quantum field theory

44:42.480 --> 44:45.280
with doing quantum gravity research.

44:46.240 --> 44:49.080
For me, I would say the young people,

44:49.080 --> 44:51.840
so you want the older veterans of the field

44:51.840 --> 44:54.000
to say they were wrong, and that may never happen.

44:54.000 --> 44:54.840
No, no, no, no, maybe they're not wrong.

44:54.840 --> 44:55.680
I think if you talk-

44:55.680 --> 44:57.000
I want them to face the issue.

44:57.000 --> 44:58.760
But I think if you talk to the,

44:58.760 --> 45:00.920
I think the response you're talking about,

45:00.920 --> 45:03.240
which is like, do people see the challenges?

45:03.240 --> 45:06.320
I think what a lot of younger people would say

45:06.320 --> 45:08.640
the lessons that have been learned from string theory

45:08.640 --> 45:11.760
is that we didn't understand quantum field theory well enough

45:11.760 --> 45:13.120
to be ready to jump.

45:13.120 --> 45:15.800
We've learned so many lessons about just quantum field theory

45:15.800 --> 45:17.920
that we were kind of out over our skis thinking,

45:17.920 --> 45:20.160
oh, we've got this quantum field theory thing solved.

45:20.160 --> 45:22.040
We should be jumping to quantum gravity.

45:22.040 --> 45:24.200
And we've learned so much about quantum field theory.

45:24.200 --> 45:27.520
And quantum field theory is certainly relevant to,

45:28.800 --> 45:31.280
data and real life and cosmology.

45:31.280 --> 45:33.000
And as a matter of it, it covers everything.

45:33.000 --> 45:36.200
It's the, to steal a headline from an article

45:36.200 --> 45:39.520
on the CERN Courier, it's like the theory of theories, right?

45:39.520 --> 45:42.520
It organizes not just like one theory,

45:42.520 --> 45:45.360
but sort of how all theories fit together.

45:45.360 --> 45:46.600
So what is the theory of theory?

45:46.600 --> 45:48.840
So this was used as a title to an article

45:48.840 --> 45:50.640
about effective field theory.

45:50.640 --> 45:53.080
But it was just understood that a lot of what we've been

45:53.080 --> 45:56.320
learning is, what is the space of theories

45:56.320 --> 45:57.360
that are self consistent?

45:57.360 --> 45:59.120
Like what are the rules?

45:59.120 --> 46:01.360
And part of the, why was,

46:01.360 --> 46:03.320
like one of the things we got out of string theory,

46:03.320 --> 46:06.960
what like the string community was ADFCFT.

46:06.960 --> 46:08.560
And what that told us is a lot of things

46:08.560 --> 46:10.040
that we had been thinking were,

46:10.040 --> 46:11.560
people had been thinking were problems

46:11.600 --> 46:13.120
that were going to be solved by the string

46:13.120 --> 46:15.520
were really phenomena that was living

46:15.520 --> 46:17.160
in an everyday quantum field theory

46:17.160 --> 46:19.080
that we hadn't fully understood.

46:19.080 --> 46:21.440
And I would say my generation probably more,

46:21.440 --> 46:24.040
like a lot of people who I think you might look at

46:24.040 --> 46:25.680
and say, you know, based on their training,

46:25.680 --> 46:27.440
like who their PhD advisors were,

46:27.440 --> 46:29.520
you might say, well, that's a string theorist.

46:29.520 --> 46:31.360
And I would say, I don't think they ever do string theory.

46:31.360 --> 46:33.200
Like they do quantum field theory

46:33.200 --> 46:34.520
and they know quantum field theory is relevant.

46:34.520 --> 46:35.360
They've moved to that.

46:35.360 --> 46:36.920
But I think some never did it.

46:36.920 --> 46:38.960
Like literally at no point in their graduate career

46:38.960 --> 46:41.240
at any point they have a, like so myself,

46:41.240 --> 46:42.840
I did string theory when I was younger.

46:42.840 --> 46:44.720
I would not characterize myself as a string theorist

46:44.720 --> 46:47.520
or someone who ever uses string theory.

46:47.520 --> 46:50.120
Nobody told me I had to do string theory.

46:50.120 --> 46:51.720
You have characterized yourself as somebody

46:51.720 --> 46:53.280
who finds it useful in what you do.

46:53.280 --> 46:55.040
And so you are using string theory.

46:55.040 --> 47:00.040
Because I learned, because the phrase what was useful

47:00.920 --> 47:03.960
is that string theory was always characterized as,

47:03.960 --> 47:05.000
you know, what is it?

47:05.000 --> 47:06.960
What's the problem of quantum gravity we're trying to solve?

47:06.960 --> 47:09.320
We're trying to solve problems about the fact

47:09.400 --> 47:11.480
that the thing doesn't make sense at short distances.

47:11.480 --> 47:13.120
And of course, all these things are supposed to make sense

47:13.120 --> 47:13.960
at long distances

47:13.960 --> 47:15.720
because they're good effective field theories.

47:15.720 --> 47:17.240
We don't like, unless we're doing

47:17.240 --> 47:18.880
all four short distance physics,

47:18.880 --> 47:21.800
it has, you know, everything should just make sense

47:21.800 --> 47:23.040
in some reasonable way.

47:23.040 --> 47:25.480
And, but I learned what I was learning

47:25.480 --> 47:26.320
about loop quantum gravity.

47:26.320 --> 47:27.640
That's nowhere in sight, right?

47:27.640 --> 47:31.160
Because there's so many lessons I didn't learn

47:31.160 --> 47:33.000
that were just basic lessons about, you know,

47:33.000 --> 47:35.160
how should theories be organized

47:35.160 --> 47:37.800
that were never in the loop quantum gravity playbook,

47:37.800 --> 47:39.040
at least when I was learning it.

47:39.240 --> 47:41.880
And so, yeah, what I learned doing string theory was like,

47:41.880 --> 47:43.320
I really learned effective field theory.

47:43.320 --> 47:45.280
I learned, when is there a problem

47:45.280 --> 47:47.880
that I actually have to worry about string theory too?

47:47.880 --> 47:51.560
And what I mostly learned is that this is very small.

47:51.560 --> 47:52.400
No, of course.

47:52.400 --> 47:53.800
And you can do a lot of really, really exciting

47:53.800 --> 47:56.400
and cool stuff that's, I would call fundamental

47:56.400 --> 47:57.560
without ever talking about quantum gravity.

47:57.560 --> 47:58.880
I've looked at your career

47:58.880 --> 48:00.840
and to the best of my understanding,

48:00.840 --> 48:03.840
your career is at the school with three basic legs.

48:03.840 --> 48:06.000
One of which is cosmology,

48:06.000 --> 48:08.440
where you're gonna get data from all the great new instruments

48:08.480 --> 48:10.520
that we're putting towards the heavens.

48:11.520 --> 48:13.400
Second thing is effective theory,

48:13.400 --> 48:16.320
so that you're going to reduce everything to something

48:16.320 --> 48:18.920
which, you know, at some particular scale

48:18.920 --> 48:21.680
is very cleanly defined and you can work with it.

48:23.280 --> 48:26.840
And then the other thing is some amount of particle theory

48:26.840 --> 48:29.400
where you're gonna hope to use the cosmological

48:29.400 --> 48:31.920
through the effective theory to elucidate the nature

48:31.920 --> 48:34.800
of the fundamental fields as waves and collision.

48:34.800 --> 48:38.240
So that's, I see your particular gambit.

48:38.240 --> 48:40.880
And I'm 100% supportive of it.

48:40.880 --> 48:42.760
You did refer to yourself as a young person.

48:42.760 --> 48:44.360
You're over 40 if I'm not mistaken.

48:44.360 --> 48:45.200
Unfortunately, yes.

48:45.200 --> 48:47.320
Okay, so you're not a young person.

48:47.320 --> 48:48.720
I think I just crossed the threshold

48:48.720 --> 48:50.200
by academic standards.

48:50.200 --> 48:51.200
No, no, no, but you know,

48:51.200 --> 48:53.280
Derock's old thing about a physicist

48:53.280 --> 48:57.640
the past 30th year, this is elongated in part

48:57.640 --> 49:00.360
because of the fact that we deviated

49:00.360 --> 49:01.680
from scientific norms.

49:01.680 --> 49:05.120
We don't have 25 year olds and 30 year olds

49:05.120 --> 49:07.920
who are running the field the way I think of as normal.

49:07.920 --> 49:10.200
I think there are way too many people in the field

49:10.200 --> 49:12.040
to be honest when you're asking what would you do?

49:12.040 --> 49:13.800
And I feel that of those people,

49:13.800 --> 49:18.320
they're not properly arrayed across first.

49:18.320 --> 49:20.320
Well, they're not fermionic.

49:20.320 --> 49:22.480
There are plenty of people who like

49:22.480 --> 49:26.880
Brian Greenfield's no need to query Peter Wojt

49:26.880 --> 49:28.520
who's putting forward a twister theory

49:28.520 --> 49:32.400
based on the group SU4 and its inclusion of SU3 cross U1

49:33.400 --> 49:36.520
as a subgroup in twister space

49:36.560 --> 49:39.720
with a WIC continuation to SU2 cross SU2

49:39.720 --> 49:41.600
where one of the two halves gives the weak force

49:41.600 --> 49:44.480
and therefore it gives you an idea of the asymmetry.

49:44.480 --> 49:47.520
You have to read your colleague's stuff

49:47.520 --> 49:51.200
whether you like it or not to be a good colleague.

49:51.200 --> 49:53.000
You don't have to read all of it,

49:53.000 --> 49:56.280
but when you can't put in 45 minutes

49:56.280 --> 49:57.960
and there was a piece of French

49:57.960 --> 50:00.560
that was between 45 and minutes, I didn't say on air

50:01.600 --> 50:03.040
and you say, I'm too busy

50:03.040 --> 50:05.160
and then we catch you playing ping pong in the lounge

50:05.200 --> 50:06.960
or you're going to drinking

50:06.960 --> 50:09.920
or you're writing a blog about nothing in particular,

50:09.920 --> 50:11.920
it's completely disingenuous.

50:11.920 --> 50:14.960
Now, another example of this is Garrett Leasey.

50:14.960 --> 50:17.920
Garrett Leasey is a snickering.

50:17.920 --> 50:19.720
Garrett Leasey, you mean that thing

50:19.720 --> 50:20.960
that dislodged this man?

50:20.960 --> 50:22.400
Okay.

50:22.400 --> 50:24.080
No, it doesn't work.

50:24.080 --> 50:25.480
I don't think it works.

50:25.480 --> 50:28.560
It's got tons of interesting good ideas in it.

50:28.560 --> 50:33.560
And this condescension against individual research programs

50:34.160 --> 50:36.120
where somebody has a really interesting idea

50:36.120 --> 50:39.720
and I think both Peter White and Garrett are wrong

50:39.720 --> 50:41.360
and it's not going to work,

50:41.360 --> 50:43.800
but I'll be goddamn if I'm going to stand back and say,

50:43.800 --> 50:45.960
because I think I can see why it's not going to work,

50:45.960 --> 50:48.200
I'm going to pretend that you have no ideas

50:48.200 --> 50:51.480
and I'm going to slag you behind your back as a colleague

50:51.480 --> 50:55.240
and I'm going to dunk and drag on Twitter.

50:55.240 --> 50:57.200
This is toxic behavior.

50:57.200 --> 50:58.400
And so what I think is,

50:58.400 --> 51:01.840
is that we have very few idiosyncratic programs

51:01.840 --> 51:03.720
that are able to even share a stage.

51:03.720 --> 51:07.160
There's no point of contact where,

51:09.680 --> 51:11.840
I have an unusual bookmark in this book.

51:12.960 --> 51:14.080
It's a dollar.

51:14.080 --> 51:15.960
Yeah, it's a dollar.

51:15.960 --> 51:18.720
This is a dollar signed by Sheldon Glashow

51:18.720 --> 51:23.560
where I won it in a 20 minute discussion in his office

51:23.560 --> 51:26.520
and it took him 27 years to,

51:27.360 --> 51:31.520
27, I'm going to turn into an NFT and make bajillions.

51:32.680 --> 51:34.960
It took him 27 years to acknowledge

51:34.960 --> 51:39.520
that he'd lost the bet on whether G2 contained SU3.

51:39.520 --> 51:42.120
I have no idea why that took 27 years.

51:42.120 --> 51:44.720
I like Shelley, we have a good relationship,

51:44.720 --> 51:48.240
but the fact is you can't have people saying,

51:48.240 --> 51:50.120
oh, I'm late to pick up my kids,

51:50.120 --> 51:53.080
that I have to go out to dinner or whatever

51:53.080 --> 51:55.640
and never actually make eye contact

51:55.680 --> 51:58.320
with the fact that they're not giving real answers.

51:58.320 --> 52:01.520
And by the way, I would love to actually talk physics

52:01.520 --> 52:03.360
rather than about physics,

52:03.360 --> 52:06.000
but what I'm trying to say is that our meta problem

52:06.000 --> 52:08.040
is that with all the money floating around,

52:08.040 --> 52:09.960
nobody holds a conference saying,

52:10.960 --> 52:13.080
the last 40 years, WTF,

52:13.920 --> 52:15.440
with a bunch of different theories,

52:15.440 --> 52:17.960
like does anybody else have an idea?

52:17.960 --> 52:19.840
And I can assure you, I can go

52:21.520 --> 52:24.520
on very large platforms and talk about very concrete ideas.

52:24.520 --> 52:26.160
I can try to tell you why I believe

52:26.160 --> 52:27.720
that there are three generations of matter,

52:27.720 --> 52:30.400
why it's chiral, et cetera, et cetera.

52:30.400 --> 52:33.680
And I promise you that the very weird behavior

52:33.680 --> 52:36.160
is that people don't take it seriously

52:36.160 --> 52:37.640
because what they're really trying to do

52:37.640 --> 52:39.200
is not ask questions.

52:39.200 --> 52:40.280
They're really trying to say,

52:40.280 --> 52:41.960
how do I make this problem go away

52:41.960 --> 52:44.400
so I can get back to the cargo cult science

52:44.400 --> 52:47.160
that I've made a career around inside of a large community?

52:47.160 --> 52:48.520
That's what's dangerous.

52:48.520 --> 52:50.360
See, I don't agree with that.

52:50.360 --> 52:52.800
I mean, I would say that a lot of people

52:52.800 --> 52:54.280
aren't gonna engage with,

52:54.280 --> 52:57.480
I mean, the idea that what we need to do

52:57.480 --> 52:59.480
is find the right way to unify the forces,

52:59.480 --> 53:02.920
I think is just, as you said, it's been unproductive.

53:02.920 --> 53:06.200
And a lot of people don't mind that that's how they're,

53:06.200 --> 53:09.320
like, you know, there are weird hints from nature, right?

53:09.320 --> 53:11.880
Like cosmological constant is a weird hint from nature.

53:11.880 --> 53:13.720
And like, we'd like to, we'd like that.

53:13.720 --> 53:15.720
Is it unification or that unification wouldn't work?

53:15.720 --> 53:18.160
But Daniel, if I ask you,

53:18.160 --> 53:20.240
what is your best guess as to why there appear

53:20.240 --> 53:22.200
to be three generations of matter?

53:22.200 --> 53:24.160
Would you say you have a guess?

53:24.160 --> 53:27.000
No, I wouldn't, I mean, I would say there are many people

53:27.000 --> 53:29.320
who have worked hard on coming up with models.

53:29.320 --> 53:31.640
I'll see, many seem plausible.

53:31.640 --> 53:36.120
Like, it could be, like, I have no particular opinion.

53:36.120 --> 53:38.760
And I don't think that we're gonna find the answer.

53:38.760 --> 53:40.440
So if somebody came up to me

53:40.440 --> 53:43.880
who could pass sort of a basic competency test

53:43.880 --> 53:45.040
and said, I think I know why

53:45.040 --> 53:47.220
there are three generations of matter.

53:47.220 --> 53:48.480
I would find that fascinating.

53:48.480 --> 53:50.320
Brian and I were on the phone,

53:50.320 --> 53:52.360
we were talking about this issue.

53:52.360 --> 53:54.120
And Brian said, well, what if I were to tell you

53:54.120 --> 53:57.200
of something so exciting that it has seven sigma this,

53:57.200 --> 54:00.920
that which is to me, would you race down to San Diego?

54:00.920 --> 54:01.760
I said, sure.

54:04.280 --> 54:07.600
And I think he wasn't prepared for that answer.

54:07.600 --> 54:10.460
There is something about the excitement

54:10.460 --> 54:13.760
of believing things, trying things

54:13.760 --> 54:17.640
and caring about what your colleagues believe.

54:17.640 --> 54:20.800
Do you have any high conviction beliefs

54:20.800 --> 54:23.060
about the extension of the standard model?

54:24.040 --> 54:26.480
So I do have my high conviction belief

54:26.480 --> 54:28.920
is that anything that extends the standard model

54:28.920 --> 54:33.920
will look like something that's effective field theory

54:34.080 --> 54:35.080
at low energies.

54:35.080 --> 54:38.520
So if I'm going to look for hints, experimental hints

54:38.520 --> 54:41.960
that are gonna tell me which way the world actually works,

54:41.960 --> 54:43.640
my strategy is gonna be,

54:43.640 --> 54:45.680
write down everything I could imagine

54:45.680 --> 54:47.240
that would look like a change

54:47.240 --> 54:48.720
to the effective theory of the standard model

54:48.720 --> 54:49.960
and go look for that.

54:49.960 --> 54:53.320
And that is what most experimental programs are looking for.

54:53.320 --> 54:54.520
But that avoids the question.

54:54.520 --> 54:58.200
Do you personally have any high conviction beliefs

54:58.200 --> 54:59.640
and I'll extend it?

54:59.640 --> 55:02.400
Do you think we have anything wrong in the standard model,

55:02.400 --> 55:05.800
not just in terms of the Lagrangian and its consequences,

55:05.800 --> 55:07.860
but in terms of how we talk about it?

55:07.860 --> 55:10.000
And do you have any high conviction beliefs

55:10.000 --> 55:13.840
for what extends it and what is likely to be true?

55:13.840 --> 55:15.540
That are really things like this, I believe,

55:15.540 --> 55:16.960
can you say the phrase this, I believe.

55:16.960 --> 55:20.180
I believe that the universe is Lorenz invariant

55:20.180 --> 55:21.180
at short distances,

55:21.180 --> 55:24.500
that whatever unifies the standard model

55:24.500 --> 55:26.380
is not breaking Lorenz invariance.

55:28.380 --> 55:29.380
That if you observed,

55:29.380 --> 55:31.220
if we were to observe something cosmologically

55:31.220 --> 55:33.500
or laboratory, that would break your conviction

55:33.500 --> 55:36.620
or it would cause you to reveal excitingly new research.

55:36.620 --> 55:38.740
You believe in relativity.

55:38.740 --> 55:39.580
Yes, absolutely.

55:39.580 --> 55:40.980
That is not very bold.

55:40.980 --> 55:43.660
Okay, but by the way,

55:44.180 --> 55:46.180
most things that are being proposed as extensions

55:46.180 --> 55:48.820
to the standard model by definition are,

55:48.820 --> 55:49.900
well, they might be wrong.

55:49.900 --> 55:50.740
Most of them are wrong.

55:50.740 --> 55:51.580
How do you know, Eric?

55:51.580 --> 55:52.420
We haven't looked for action.

55:52.420 --> 55:54.340
Well, because they can't all be correct.

55:54.340 --> 55:55.780
They're not all compatible.

55:55.780 --> 55:56.780
Some of them are mutually exclusive.

55:56.780 --> 55:58.580
All I'm saying is this is to say

55:58.580 --> 56:01.860
that the universe is manifestly Lorenz invariant

56:01.860 --> 56:04.660
is an interesting claim that could be falsified.

56:04.660 --> 56:07.260
And by falsification, I think that would excite you.

56:07.260 --> 56:08.260
That wouldn't depress you.

56:08.260 --> 56:09.380
That wouldn't ruin your day.

56:09.380 --> 56:11.500
It would totally change how I think about it.

56:11.500 --> 56:13.140
I love your puppy point.

56:13.140 --> 56:14.180
Puppies are adorable.

56:14.180 --> 56:15.540
Ice cream is delicious.

56:16.380 --> 56:17.220
I understand.

56:17.220 --> 56:19.180
Mom and apple pie are good things.

56:19.180 --> 56:21.500
But there are, I mean, I think that's a case

56:21.500 --> 56:24.380
where people have legitimately proposed ideas

56:24.380 --> 56:27.060
that break learns and they're interesting ideas.

56:27.060 --> 56:31.220
So, someone who had an idea that broke this principle

56:31.220 --> 56:33.260
that was within the kind of traditional community

56:33.260 --> 56:36.420
but really broke away from it was Peter Harava

56:36.420 --> 56:40.380
with his non Lorenz invariant solutions to gravity,

56:40.380 --> 56:42.060
his proposal.

56:42.060 --> 56:44.620
And again, like, it was an interesting idea.

56:44.620 --> 56:45.620
I didn't look at that and go,

56:45.620 --> 56:46.780
I understood what he's doing.

56:46.780 --> 56:47.620
We read those papers.

56:47.620 --> 56:48.460
Everyone's like, that's interesting idea.

56:48.460 --> 56:49.620
So you read the paper, you like.

56:49.620 --> 56:51.460
But I also don't think it's the way the world works.

56:51.460 --> 56:52.500
And I also.

56:52.500 --> 56:53.660
That's not what I'm talking about.

56:53.660 --> 56:55.060
Like if Zhao came out with something,

56:55.060 --> 56:57.340
maybe you look at it and then you say,

56:57.340 --> 56:58.420
okay, that's pretty wild.

56:58.420 --> 57:00.180
I don't buy it, but I understand what he's doing.

57:00.180 --> 57:02.500
But I think, again, the difference between Peter

57:02.500 --> 57:04.900
who was definitely deviating away from the community

57:04.900 --> 57:06.060
was not that they're like,

57:06.060 --> 57:07.660
he's a card-carrying member of the community.

57:07.660 --> 57:10.340
Is that he was able to communicate his idea

57:10.340 --> 57:12.420
in a way that made sense to everyone.

57:12.420 --> 57:15.140
And, but that, but I guess what I would say is like,

57:15.140 --> 57:17.100
you're asking me to take a definitive position

57:17.100 --> 57:18.460
about a theory we could never test.

57:18.460 --> 57:20.340
No, no, no, I'm saying you're a theoretical physicist.

57:20.340 --> 57:21.180
Yeah, absolutely.

57:21.180 --> 57:22.900
You are, you know, and to be fair to you,

57:22.900 --> 57:25.380
cause I'm not, there's no gotcha or a zinger here.

57:25.380 --> 57:27.860
I see you as mostly a cosmologist

57:27.860 --> 57:30.100
who is keeping the door open to particle theory

57:30.100 --> 57:32.820
through the conduit of effective theory, right?

57:32.820 --> 57:34.140
And that may not be fair

57:34.140 --> 57:35.780
because I've only been studying stuff for days.

57:35.780 --> 57:36.620
I understand.

57:36.620 --> 57:38.420
I guess what I would say is that I,

57:38.420 --> 57:40.380
no, effective field theory is life, right?

57:40.380 --> 57:42.820
Like it's like, it's how the,

57:42.820 --> 57:45.740
it's how everything we organize, it's just,

57:45.740 --> 57:47.300
it's all we see, right?

57:47.300 --> 57:49.380
I'm living here in this like, there's not like,

57:49.380 --> 57:50.620
Newton's laws weren't wrong.

57:50.620 --> 57:52.740
They're just an effective theory relevant to our.

57:52.740 --> 57:54.260
If we were to talk about biology, right?

57:54.260 --> 57:55.740
So we have the stratification.

57:55.740 --> 57:57.700
We have cytology, the study of cells below.

57:57.700 --> 57:59.380
Then we have histology, the study of tissues.

57:59.380 --> 58:00.900
And we have physiology above that.

58:00.900 --> 58:03.180
And we have the organization and anatomy.

58:03.180 --> 58:05.660
And if you stayed down at the level and saying, you know,

58:05.660 --> 58:09.060
it would be absolutely responsible for us to speculate

58:09.060 --> 58:11.180
into different regimes because we understand

58:11.180 --> 58:12.900
that we don't actually have information.

58:12.900 --> 58:15.820
We've learned the lesson of Ken Wilson very well.

58:15.820 --> 58:17.220
That would be pretty disappointing.

58:17.220 --> 58:19.740
If you think about, for example, Wheel of Fortune,

58:19.740 --> 58:21.620
there are these one letter solves

58:21.620 --> 58:24.580
where somebody actually guesses the entire puzzle

58:24.580 --> 58:25.620
from a single letter.

58:25.620 --> 58:27.060
Look up a guy named Rufus, for example.

58:27.060 --> 58:27.900
I understand.

58:27.900 --> 58:30.580
Now, my claim is, is that the, the,

58:30.580 --> 58:33.060
the dark side of the genius of Ken Wilson.

58:33.060 --> 58:35.140
And by the way, Ken Wilson is a good example.

58:35.140 --> 58:37.660
Like we just lost Jeff Becker, the guitarist.

58:37.660 --> 58:39.700
He was every professional electric guitarist,

58:39.700 --> 58:42.180
favorite guitarist, but he wasn't everybody's favorite

58:42.180 --> 58:43.940
guitarist who didn't play guitar.

58:43.940 --> 58:47.180
In a certain sense, Ken Wilson walks on water

58:47.180 --> 58:51.140
within the competent community of physics researchers.

58:51.140 --> 58:54.420
But there's a dark side also, just the way Jeff Becker

58:54.420 --> 58:57.500
maybe put too much emphasis on the whammy bar

58:57.500 --> 59:00.300
of pushing everything into this realm

59:00.300 --> 59:02.900
where it's denuded of much of its meaning.

59:02.900 --> 59:05.700
Like if I were to say to you that the Higgs field

59:05.700 --> 59:07.260
shows up in effective theory

59:07.260 --> 59:09.860
as a spin zero fundamental scalar,

59:09.860 --> 59:11.580
but I don't think that that's its purpose.

59:11.580 --> 59:14.540
I think that it actually belongs to the actual,

59:14.540 --> 59:16.580
and the way in which it's disguised

59:16.580 --> 59:20.700
so that it's spin appears different than its naive spin,

59:20.700 --> 59:23.540
which is its function as a, as a part of a connection.

59:24.940 --> 59:28.300
That's something in which effective theory

59:28.300 --> 59:30.220
is not going to necessarily point to that

59:30.220 --> 59:34.060
because effective theory tends to show you this picture

59:34.060 --> 59:36.180
that is often denuded of higher level structures

59:36.180 --> 59:38.540
because we're not too afraid to guess.

59:38.540 --> 59:41.140
No, the idea is just that it,

59:42.460 --> 59:45.620
you can have as wild a variation

59:45.620 --> 59:48.740
of the difference of the origin of two theories as you like.

59:48.740 --> 59:53.020
And if I limit my observations to some energy scale

59:53.020 --> 59:55.900
that's set by colliders or whatever I can do,

59:55.900 --> 59:58.140
that the only way that I can tell them apart

59:58.140 --> 01:00:00.980
is by the parameters of the long distance.

01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:03.900
No, now the parameters can be really useful hints.

01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:08.460
So in the sixties, Weinberg guessed at asymptotic freedom,

01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:10.540
which was that the idea that they're like,

01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:13.060
the theory is really made up of quarks

01:00:13.060 --> 01:00:15.300
and things that look like microscopic particles

01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:18.100
just bouncing around, even though they live inside a proton.

01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:20.900
He guessed at this because of the specific relationships

01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:24.940
between certain of the couplings of nuclear physics

01:00:24.940 --> 01:00:26.940
because we couldn't go and look inside of the proton

01:00:26.940 --> 01:00:28.020
at that point in history.

01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:31.020
So it's absolutely true that through this lens

01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:32.820
you can discover exactly as you're seeing.

01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:35.260
You can within this lens say,

01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:38.260
there's a pattern here and I can use the tools

01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:40.300
at my disposal to say the only way to get this pattern

01:00:40.300 --> 01:00:42.780
points at some deeper structure.

01:00:42.780 --> 01:00:43.980
So that's exactly what we do.

01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:46.820
So for example, why proton decay experiments

01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:48.260
were so exciting because even though

01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:50.020
they're low energy experiment,

01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:52.100
they would tell us about physics at very high energies

01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:55.500
because we only know a few ways to create proton decay

01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:57.300
or this is why people are really excited

01:00:57.300 --> 01:00:59.620
to do treating masses because do treating masses hint

01:00:59.620 --> 01:01:02.780
at something going on at extremely high energies

01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:05.900
that will never ever be able to probe in the lab.

01:01:05.900 --> 01:01:08.380
But if you don't kind of, on the other hand,

01:01:08.380 --> 01:01:10.940
like if I write down a theory that only changes

01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:13.500
the gears of how the universe works

01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:15.380
on some scale that I can never observe,

01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:17.900
my only hope is to see it through the pattern.

01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:19.540
What's going on with this one?

01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:21.700
You're mislearning the lesson of the baryon,

01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:23.580
which is that the baryon isn't decoded

01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:25.620
into the Lagrangian, the quarks are,

01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:29.780
but that, I don't even know if we're talking about it,

01:01:29.780 --> 01:01:34.020
say infrared slavery with physics conscience,

01:01:34.020 --> 01:01:37.940
but the issue is that protons and neutrons

01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:39.900
are not what is seen in the Lagrangian.

01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:41.740
You have to actually unpack them,

01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:44.540
unpack the fundamental constituents

01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:46.700
to get the observable constituents.

01:01:46.700 --> 01:01:48.780
Now that lesson when over learned,

01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:52.060
which is what I'm concerned your community has done,

01:01:52.060 --> 01:01:55.300
becomes inhibitory and everybody gets innervated

01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:56.940
because nobody wants to be the fool

01:01:56.940 --> 01:01:59.100
who didn't learn the lesson of effective theory

01:01:59.100 --> 01:02:00.180
and renormalization.

01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:02.100
And that's what's concerning me,

01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:04.860
is that in general, we have a group of people

01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:06.980
who are incredibly worried about their union card

01:02:06.980 --> 01:02:09.500
and being respectable and when they're heterodox,

01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:12.020
they're heterodox in the most mild and unhelpful way,

01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:14.500
particularly if you have a metastable state

01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:18.420
where small perturbations don't work out very well.

01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:20.100
And so in all of these situations,

01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:22.300
when I try to engage you in terms of,

01:02:22.300 --> 01:02:25.140
if you wanna actually talk physics on a podcast,

01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:27.820
we always talk around physics, we talk about physics,

01:02:27.820 --> 01:02:29.860
but we don't actually say, well, what do you believe,

01:02:29.860 --> 01:02:32.700
what do you know, what are the high conviction gets?

01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:35.020
And I'll say something more.

01:02:35.020 --> 01:02:37.780
I think you're an extremely good scientist.

01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:39.500
I've read some of your stuff.

01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:44.060
I don't aspire to be focused on good scientists

01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:46.420
because I believe that we have a confusion

01:02:46.420 --> 01:02:50.140
that great science is just good science turned up to 11.

01:02:50.140 --> 01:02:53.460
And I think if you, I had this conversation with Jim Watson,

01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:55.780
his basic point was we were not,

01:02:55.780 --> 01:02:58.980
Watson Crick were not good scientists in Jim's view.

01:02:58.980 --> 01:03:00.300
He said, Rosalind Franklin was,

01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:02.580
and the reason she didn't get the double helix

01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:04.020
was not because it was stolen,

01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:05.940
which there are certainly issues,

01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:08.820
but because she refused to spend a day decamped

01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:10.820
into the idea that the Maltese cross

01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:14.220
near X-ray crystallography represented a helix.

01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:17.740
And so his point was our search space is tiny

01:03:17.740 --> 01:03:20.540
because we're only looking for helical models

01:03:20.540 --> 01:03:23.140
and her search space was enormous

01:03:23.140 --> 01:03:26.420
because she correctly viewed that that particular pattern

01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:28.340
was not sufficient to narrow it down.

01:03:29.340 --> 01:03:32.020
But I mean, someone watching is just this passionate

01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:34.220
but has some knowledge of you and in the field.

01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:36.940
I mean, you've ruled out, just in words today

01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:39.340
and not to mention previous discussions we've had,

01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:44.700
alternative theories to anything but your own

01:03:44.700 --> 01:03:46.860
personal conviction, which is that she,

01:03:46.860 --> 01:03:49.180
so you've ruled out E8, you've ruled out Wolfram,

01:03:49.180 --> 01:03:51.140
you've ruled out loop quantum gravity.

01:03:51.140 --> 01:03:52.940
Not, I think ruled it out like they shall be taken

01:03:52.940 --> 01:03:53.780
behind the woodshed.

01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:54.620
No, bro.

01:03:55.460 --> 01:03:56.780
Well, so how much time-

01:03:56.780 --> 01:04:00.380
I think we should be invested in cellular automata.

01:04:00.380 --> 01:04:02.860
I think we really need to study the large exceptionally groups

01:04:02.860 --> 01:04:04.740
inside of the TITS-Fordens' Rural Structure.

01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:06.580
The theories of everything.

01:04:06.580 --> 01:04:09.420
I think that Peter Wojt's theory to begin with SU3,

01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:10.940
which is the one part of the symmetries

01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:13.980
that doesn't have another name because U1 is also spin two,

01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:17.660
SO2 the circle, same thing with SU2 is the three sphere,

01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:20.620
spin three, SU3 is unique in that it doesn't have

01:04:20.620 --> 01:04:21.940
another name.

01:04:21.940 --> 01:04:25.580
And so he begins with that and he sticks basically U3

01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:27.540
inside of SU4.

01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:29.420
And I think it's a great idea.

01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:32.060
And I don't want to be mischaracterized.

01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:35.260
I am the only person pushing forward GU.

01:04:36.580 --> 01:04:39.580
I am also pushing forward when I was asked recently

01:04:39.580 --> 01:04:40.980
by the Institute for Arts and Ideas.

01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:42.700
They wanted to say, well, tell us now about GU

01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:44.180
after you've done all this service to our field.

01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:45.820
I was like, no, I don't want to do that.

01:04:45.820 --> 01:04:48.140
I would rather tell you about my competitors

01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:50.900
in idiosyncratic fermionic space.

01:04:50.900 --> 01:04:52.580
It's you guys who don't do that.

01:04:52.580 --> 01:04:55.660
So please don't put on me that I'm simply a proponent

01:04:55.660 --> 01:04:57.060
that is always pushing my product

01:04:57.060 --> 01:04:58.860
and selling from the stage, far from it.

01:04:58.860 --> 01:05:00.220
I don't think it's selling from it,

01:05:00.220 --> 01:05:02.260
but it's just from a pragmatic standpoint.

01:05:02.260 --> 01:05:05.100
Daniel's got a limited amount of theoretical bandwidth.

01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:07.180
My students do as well.

01:05:07.180 --> 01:05:08.260
It's not that much, Brian.

01:05:08.260 --> 01:05:09.860
Well, no, I agree with you.

01:05:09.860 --> 01:05:12.220
I agree with you that to hear Sabine say,

01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:14.140
well, she doesn't have time to look at your theory

01:05:14.140 --> 01:05:16.020
and Garrett's theory and Wolfram's theory.

01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:17.020
She doesn't want to get sucked in.

01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:19.820
She doesn't want to, but that doesn't prove that it's right.

01:05:19.820 --> 01:05:21.860
I mean, it's not evidence that they're correct.

01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:23.500
No, but it leaves the wrong impression.

01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:26.580
Right, and that's maybe not as collegial as it could be,

01:05:26.580 --> 01:05:28.620
but there's a limited amount.

01:05:28.620 --> 01:05:31.020
So the question is for working card carries,

01:05:31.020 --> 01:05:32.420
you call them union members.

01:05:32.420 --> 01:05:35.580
I mean, what is it about what you're doing

01:05:35.580 --> 01:05:38.300
that is most exciting and most interesting to you

01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:40.740
and the reason that keeps you getting up in the morning

01:05:40.740 --> 01:05:42.460
and thinking about it in the middle of the night?

01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:45.860
What questions or what contributions are so interesting

01:05:45.860 --> 01:05:48.260
and promising along the, obviously promising

01:05:48.260 --> 01:05:50.420
from the current research direction you're pursuing?

01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:53.820
Okay, so I mean, what have I spent the past years working on

01:05:53.820 --> 01:05:56.060
is trying to understand the sitter space.

01:05:56.060 --> 01:05:58.500
Now, the sitter space seems to be the universe we live in.

01:05:58.500 --> 01:05:59.620
It's also-

01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:00.820
What do you mean by that?

01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:04.020
As in the expansion of the universe right now.

01:06:04.020 --> 01:06:04.860
It looks-

01:06:04.860 --> 01:06:05.700
It's approximately-

01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:06.540
It's approximately a sitter.

01:06:06.540 --> 01:06:07.900
Okay, but there's a big difference.

01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:12.340
Okay, yes, but at the level of approximation

01:06:12.340 --> 01:06:15.060
that the universe we live in seems to be a sitter,

01:06:15.060 --> 01:06:18.220
we did not understand how to calculate things in the sitter.

01:06:18.220 --> 01:06:20.220
And there are people who claim that,

01:06:20.220 --> 01:06:21.860
the sitter was fundamentally unstable

01:06:21.860 --> 01:06:24.460
because of various things that they couldn't calculate.

01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:26.420
And this proved that like,

01:06:26.420 --> 01:06:29.620
it's impossible to have a positive causal constant

01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:31.540
for this reason or the other.

01:06:31.540 --> 01:06:34.060
And so what I wanna, like,

01:06:34.060 --> 01:06:35.980
why do I use effective field theory?

01:06:35.980 --> 01:06:39.380
Because many of the calculations that people were saying

01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:41.180
proved that this were like,

01:06:41.180 --> 01:06:42.700
they were instantly,

01:06:42.740 --> 01:06:45.020
you could see the mistake in the calculation.

01:06:45.020 --> 01:06:46.380
So as you say, like,

01:06:46.380 --> 01:06:47.540
yes, effective field theory,

01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:50.580
you can have your blinders on to what might be interesting,

01:06:50.580 --> 01:06:52.820
but more often than not in my career.

01:06:52.820 --> 01:06:53.660
100%.

01:06:53.660 --> 01:06:55.300
It's like the way you say,

01:06:55.300 --> 01:06:57.300
hey, that calculation have a mistake in it.

01:06:57.300 --> 01:06:58.220
And like,

01:06:58.220 --> 01:06:59.620
all the every time it's a mistake.

01:06:59.620 --> 01:07:01.380
It's like getting rid of pseudo tensors.

01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:04.140
It's a very good place to catch errors.

01:07:04.140 --> 01:07:04.980
Absolutely.

01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:06.980
So I don't, I am in no way saying like,

01:07:06.980 --> 01:07:09.020
it's not interesting to think about things that,

01:07:09.020 --> 01:07:11.300
yeah, I'd be the first person excited about a thing

01:07:11.300 --> 01:07:13.580
that doesn't look like it lives in effective field theory.

01:07:13.580 --> 01:07:14.420
Right?

01:07:14.420 --> 01:07:15.700
And so that would be awesome.

01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:17.820
And I have friends who, you know, explore, you know,

01:07:17.820 --> 01:07:19.260
modifications to quantum mechanics.

01:07:19.260 --> 01:07:20.100
And maybe that means

01:07:20.100 --> 01:07:22.700
or things that look like they violate the rules.

01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:25.100
Those are extremely exciting and interesting things

01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:27.660
that a lot of the people do seriously consider.

01:07:27.660 --> 01:07:29.860
But again, if you don't start from,

01:07:29.860 --> 01:07:32.860
but if I have a theory that fits a set of rule,

01:07:32.860 --> 01:07:34.580
it has to follow the structure.

01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:36.380
More often than not, you just do calculations wrong.

01:07:36.380 --> 01:07:37.220
Right?

01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:38.060
And it's like, yeah,

01:07:38.060 --> 01:07:39.500
you spend five years doing calculation

01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:41.020
or in some cases in this interspace,

01:07:41.060 --> 01:07:44.980
like it was 30 years where people calculated things

01:07:44.980 --> 01:07:47.780
over and over again and literally learn nothing.

01:07:47.780 --> 01:07:49.420
There's tons of calculations

01:07:49.420 --> 01:07:51.420
and we learned no lessons from it.

01:07:51.420 --> 01:07:54.020
And the part of the point of effective field theory

01:07:54.020 --> 01:07:55.740
is that like it just organizes

01:07:55.740 --> 01:07:57.140
what are interesting calculations,

01:07:57.140 --> 01:07:58.620
what the answer should look like.

01:07:58.620 --> 01:08:00.620
And if something violates effective field theory,

01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:02.100
then at least you can go like,

01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:04.300
like waiter was the step that violated the rules.

01:08:04.300 --> 01:08:06.840
And if none of the steps violate the rules,

01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:08.020
then you've got a problem.

01:08:08.020 --> 01:08:09.740
And so what I would say for me,

01:08:09.740 --> 01:08:11.580
like the, what's the ultimate goal

01:08:11.580 --> 01:08:13.100
of understanding disorder space?

01:08:13.100 --> 01:08:15.060
Like it is getting back to like,

01:08:15.060 --> 01:08:17.100
what did the beginning of time look like?

01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:18.140
What is the space,

01:08:18.140 --> 01:08:20.460
what are the space of possible universes?

01:08:20.460 --> 01:08:22.980
And like, is the multiverse a well-defined thing?

01:08:22.980 --> 01:08:23.860
Does it even make sense?

01:08:23.860 --> 01:08:26.140
Like these are questions that are enormous.

01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:28.580
And, but we can't answer like,

01:08:28.580 --> 01:08:30.180
there are people who want to jump to the like,

01:08:30.180 --> 01:08:31.900
how do we define internal inflation

01:08:31.900 --> 01:08:33.820
and make up rules for calculating?

01:08:33.820 --> 01:08:35.260
And they make up this and they make up that.

01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:36.660
And they say, well, in my toy model

01:08:36.660 --> 01:08:38.220
with this rule and that rule, it does this.

01:08:38.220 --> 01:08:42.020
It's like, we don't know enough to play those games.

01:08:42.020 --> 01:08:43.700
And I guess that would be my point to you.

01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:46.340
You're like, in response to your comment

01:08:46.340 --> 01:08:50.140
about great scientists is that the challenge

01:08:50.140 --> 01:08:52.580
is ultimately going to be like, you know,

01:08:52.580 --> 01:08:55.260
there are moments in history that just call

01:08:55.260 --> 01:08:57.580
for careful analysis of the laws we have.

01:08:57.580 --> 01:08:59.420
Well, in the normalization a certain sense was that.

01:08:59.420 --> 01:09:00.260
Absolutely.

01:09:00.260 --> 01:09:01.860
And the same with like Lagrangian mechanics,

01:09:01.860 --> 01:09:02.700
Hamiltonian mechanics.

01:09:02.700 --> 01:09:05.860
Like there's a huge time between Newton

01:09:05.860 --> 01:09:07.700
and changes the laws and the science

01:09:07.700 --> 01:09:08.820
that happened there was super important.

01:09:08.820 --> 01:09:10.580
The question is, what time is it?

01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:12.460
Is the time for a conservative revolution?

01:09:12.460 --> 01:09:14.500
Is the time for a wildlife revolution?

01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:17.740
And I don't think it's responsible for anyone to say,

01:09:17.740 --> 01:09:20.060
I know what time it is unless they have a very good reason

01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:21.340
for saying that they know what time it is.

01:09:21.340 --> 01:09:23.660
So I think that to your earlier point,

01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:27.340
you want to let some conservative people hug the shore

01:09:27.340 --> 01:09:29.380
and say, maybe we have a small error.

01:09:30.580 --> 01:09:34.420
And you may also, I mean, the dressed and bare mass

01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:35.980
of the electron is a perfect example

01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:39.060
of what seemed to be a small error that cost two decades.

01:09:39.060 --> 01:09:42.740
So at a certain level, that's completely legitimate.

01:09:42.740 --> 01:09:45.220
And what I see you doing with effective field theory

01:09:45.220 --> 01:09:48.140
is in some sense using it as a substitute for experiment,

01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:51.300
which is how do we test whether our wild ideas

01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:53.580
actually make a certain kind of sense?

01:09:53.580 --> 01:09:55.860
And so I think it's very responsible

01:09:55.860 --> 01:09:58.980
and part of the good science wrap that I'm sticking you with

01:09:58.980 --> 01:10:01.300
is that you're trying to do something

01:10:01.300 --> 01:10:02.820
where you can't repeat the Big Bang.

01:10:02.820 --> 01:10:04.500
You can't run an experiment in the lab

01:10:04.820 --> 01:10:06.420
where everything goes right.

01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:09.140
And effective theory is a great way of sorting

01:10:09.140 --> 01:10:11.540
some amount of wheat from some amount of chaff

01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:14.820
provided that you always keep in mind

01:10:14.820 --> 01:10:18.060
that it also carries certain sorts of distortions

01:10:18.060 --> 01:10:20.420
that bias us against bold guesses

01:10:20.420 --> 01:10:22.980
because many of our structures recur

01:10:22.980 --> 01:10:27.980
at various different strata of the effective stratification.

01:10:28.220 --> 01:10:30.300
I do not disagree with that at all.

01:10:30.300 --> 01:10:32.540
And I completely agree that, you know,

01:10:32.540 --> 01:10:34.500
even in our corner of cosmology,

01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:37.060
like I would not characterize myself as a stringer,

01:10:37.060 --> 01:10:39.220
but I have found string theory useful

01:10:39.220 --> 01:10:42.140
because sometimes even though I have not found anything

01:10:42.140 --> 01:10:44.260
that cannot be expressed as effective field theory,

01:10:44.260 --> 01:10:46.540
like it does push us in a weird direction.

01:10:46.540 --> 01:10:48.380
There's like that idea came out of left field

01:10:48.380 --> 01:10:50.500
and suitably reinterpreted.

01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:51.820
It was a really cool thing to look for.

01:10:51.820 --> 01:10:54.340
This is what Nima said to me about Ravita Schwinger fields

01:10:54.340 --> 01:10:56.300
in the Bella Swanseger problem, as he said,

01:10:56.300 --> 01:10:59.180
that it's very tricky to couple Ravita Schwinger

01:10:59.180 --> 01:11:02.300
to external or to internal degrees of freedom

01:11:02.340 --> 01:11:04.380
without having superluminal problems.

01:11:04.380 --> 01:11:06.660
String theory showed us a way to do that.

01:11:06.660 --> 01:11:09.340
And so whether or not you're a string advocate

01:11:09.340 --> 01:11:11.140
or not a string advocate,

01:11:11.140 --> 01:11:13.780
you at least wanna help yourself to the bounty

01:11:13.780 --> 01:11:14.980
that came from this theory,

01:11:14.980 --> 01:11:17.460
which is one of the reasons why I'm absolutely not

01:11:17.460 --> 01:11:19.740
for ending support for string theory.

01:11:19.740 --> 01:11:21.740
But the part of the problem is that this space

01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:23.420
is so polluted by stupidity

01:11:23.420 --> 01:11:26.700
that world's smartest people acting like jackasses

01:11:26.700 --> 01:11:31.220
is that we're not having this conversation fresh and new.

01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:33.980
We're having this conversation after not even wrong.

01:11:33.980 --> 01:11:36.500
After, you know, and part of the problem is,

01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:38.260
is that the field became not even Pauly.

01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:41.020
Pauly was a dick and he was famously a dick.

01:11:41.020 --> 01:11:42.100
He was a witty dick.

01:11:42.100 --> 01:11:45.100
He was a very high, you know, very high standards.

01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:46.900
I don't know, you know, Switzerland,

01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:48.300
they're very precise over there.

01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:49.620
But the fact of the matter is,

01:11:49.620 --> 01:11:52.700
is that he's a terrible person for most people to emulate

01:11:52.700 --> 01:11:54.980
because it's basically put down physics.

01:11:54.980 --> 01:11:56.980
And so, you know, what I really believe is

01:11:56.980 --> 01:11:59.260
you're trying to do good science, you're a new generation.

01:11:59.260 --> 01:12:01.940
I don't want you meshed in some of these battles,

01:12:01.940 --> 01:12:04.900
but I also don't want you on the field of battle,

01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:06.460
sort of muddling the stuff and saying,

01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:08.580
well, there are actually a lot of interesting things.

01:12:08.580 --> 01:12:11.420
We have certain things that we need to get to

01:12:11.420 --> 01:12:14.900
in order to make sure that as this generation before me

01:12:14.900 --> 01:12:17.740
exits the stage, they leave the situation

01:12:17.740 --> 01:12:18.700
like the cat in the hat.

01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:20.620
They've made a complete mess of things.

01:12:20.620 --> 01:12:22.300
And it's important that they straighten things up

01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:23.820
before mom gets home.

01:12:23.820 --> 01:12:26.700
Yeah, but I guess I would, I would,

01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:27.860
I don't disagree.

01:12:27.860 --> 01:12:30.380
There are a lot of things that need to be cleaned up

01:12:30.380 --> 01:12:32.820
to make it, you know, but I think that it comes

01:12:32.820 --> 01:12:33.820
in many forms.

01:12:33.820 --> 01:12:38.300
And the problem is that the problem is that it's like,

01:12:38.300 --> 01:12:40.620
you can say, oh, it'd be good if, you know,

01:12:40.620 --> 01:12:41.580
people came and fix it.

01:12:41.580 --> 01:12:45.980
It is like a handful of people who whose opinions,

01:12:45.980 --> 01:12:48.460
like just saying things carry anyway.

01:12:48.460 --> 01:12:50.740
Most people, it's the accumulation of a life

01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:53.160
of work in the community that eventually move the field.

01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:55.900
So like an example is like scattering amplitudes.

01:12:55.900 --> 01:12:58.540
Like, you know, there's an like incredibly great

01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:00.820
physicists who spent their entire lives working on it.

01:13:00.820 --> 01:13:03.980
And the way that they, like their results became part

01:13:03.980 --> 01:13:07.200
of the rest of the community because of the sheer weight

01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:08.420
of what they had been doing.

01:13:08.420 --> 01:13:11.220
It was not because it was like they get a compelling talk

01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:13.780
or because like people, you know, but it was like really

01:13:13.780 --> 01:13:15.740
that it was just like, eventually they just solve

01:13:15.740 --> 01:13:17.460
so many problems that people were like,

01:13:17.460 --> 01:13:20.040
and look at the great, like this double copy problem

01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:21.760
is really exciting.

01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:22.600
Absolutely.

01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:23.580
And the amplitude, right.

01:13:24.420 --> 01:13:26.740
But again, what I would say is like,

01:13:26.740 --> 01:13:30.460
but that's where I see that like, I don't,

01:13:30.460 --> 01:13:33.060
like your point of view is like the field is gonna change

01:13:33.060 --> 01:13:36.620
when these people have to exit the stage and like,

01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:38.780
and I think to be honest, like I think a lot of people

01:13:38.780 --> 01:13:40.740
younger than already see these problems.

01:13:40.740 --> 01:13:43.180
And it's just that like, they're like the way,

01:13:43.180 --> 01:13:45.060
they're not, they don't have Edwitton's name.

01:13:45.060 --> 01:13:47.660
They don't have one's name, but they see what you're

01:13:47.660 --> 01:13:50.620
talking about and the way that that's gonna manifest

01:13:50.620 --> 01:13:52.740
itself is that in 20 years you're gonna look back

01:13:52.740 --> 01:13:53.900
and say, that's what the field is.

01:13:53.900 --> 01:13:58.900
Many of these people don't know the hypercharge

01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:02.540
or the weak ice to spin on the fundamental fields.

01:14:02.540 --> 01:14:05.780
And I hate to say this this way, but I've dealt

01:14:05.780 --> 01:14:08.140
with people who are quite a bit younger than I am,

01:14:08.140 --> 01:14:10.260
who are working in this area of fundamental physics.

01:14:10.260 --> 01:14:12.460
And I start to talk to them about the field content

01:14:12.460 --> 01:14:14.100
of the standard model.

01:14:14.100 --> 01:14:15.620
And it's astounding what they say.

01:14:15.620 --> 01:14:17.780
They say things like, oh yeah, I remember this

01:14:17.780 --> 01:14:19.460
in graduate school.

01:14:19.460 --> 01:14:21.140
What the FD mean?

01:14:21.140 --> 01:14:23.540
You're talking about the fundamental constituents

01:14:23.540 --> 01:14:26.220
of nature and you can't remember the charge

01:14:26.220 --> 01:14:28.660
on the strange cork.

01:14:28.660 --> 01:14:31.500
You can't remember whether it's, you know, upper deck.

01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:35.700
There is some problem in which people have actually

01:14:35.700 --> 01:14:37.980
departed physics.

01:14:37.980 --> 01:14:40.420
I think, I think, I know exactly what you're saying.

01:14:40.420 --> 01:14:43.420
And I know there are phenomenal like that.

01:14:43.420 --> 01:14:46.260
So a version of that, which I think is a fair criticism.

01:14:46.260 --> 01:14:49.340
I don't know the names, but I've heard the story

01:14:49.340 --> 01:14:54.140
that someone was up for a PhD at their PhD defense

01:14:54.140 --> 01:14:57.180
and they were asked, what is the wavelength of visible light?

01:14:57.180 --> 01:14:59.900
And the person said, one meter.

01:14:59.900 --> 01:15:03.700
And the examiner said, do I look blurry to you?

01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:05.620
And like, that's the kind of like, you should have

01:15:05.620 --> 01:15:08.500
real world intuition about like, in that case,

01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:09.620
it's very obvious.

01:15:09.620 --> 01:15:10.900
I mean, I would say like, I can't,

01:15:10.900 --> 01:15:12.740
I don't memorize the periodic table.

01:15:12.740 --> 01:15:14.500
I mean, the periodic table is obviously important.

01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:18.420
No, no, no, it's not the, it's 15 or 16 entries

01:15:18.460 --> 01:15:19.820
in a column vector.

01:15:20.780 --> 01:15:22.860
But again, like you're asking like, could I,

01:15:22.860 --> 01:15:24.580
if you woke me up in the middle of the night,

01:15:24.580 --> 01:15:27.700
could I reproduce every single term in the standard model?

01:15:27.700 --> 01:15:30.260
Like, you know, like, I don't know that I could.

01:15:30.260 --> 01:15:31.900
I could get most, I could get most of it.

01:15:31.900 --> 01:15:34.820
I could get most of it, but it doesn't matter to me

01:15:34.820 --> 01:15:36.820
in my, in my particular research.

01:15:36.820 --> 01:15:39.580
Wait a second, I want to understand.

01:15:39.580 --> 01:15:42.940
You're not carrying around a copy

01:15:43.820 --> 01:15:47.780
of the representation theory of SU3 cross SU2 cross U1

01:15:47.820 --> 01:15:50.580
and 15 or 16 dimensional complex space.

01:15:50.580 --> 01:15:54.060
I'm carrying in a particle data book.

01:15:54.060 --> 01:15:58.380
Look, not a spark quiz, there's no spark quiz because.

01:15:58.380 --> 01:16:00.220
I know exactly where to look it up when I'm writing.

01:16:00.220 --> 01:16:02.580
I know what most of the terms are,

01:16:02.580 --> 01:16:04.900
but if you had to get me like, what is the exact?

01:16:06.380 --> 01:16:08.860
For the same reason that memorizing a poem is important

01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:11.060
because you can always look it up,

01:16:11.060 --> 01:16:13.340
but you're not going to be able to have it.

01:16:13.340 --> 01:16:16.860
If it's not cached close to the prefrontal cortex,

01:16:16.860 --> 01:16:19.540
you're not going to be able to make use of it in real time.

01:16:19.540 --> 01:16:20.980
It's essential.

01:16:20.980 --> 01:16:22.660
And I'm not talking, by the way,

01:16:22.660 --> 01:16:25.260
about understanding all the hadronic resonances

01:16:25.260 --> 01:16:28.020
or anything like that.

01:16:28.020 --> 01:16:30.940
What I'm trying to say is the sense of,

01:16:30.940 --> 01:16:33.780
oh yeah, that's that stuff I learned in graduate school.

01:16:33.780 --> 01:16:34.620
Is it?

01:16:34.620 --> 01:16:37.660
I think to answer for Dan, that he doesn't need it.

01:16:37.660 --> 01:16:38.900
What Feynman said would apply.

01:16:38.900 --> 01:16:40.340
I mean, Feynman would disagree with you and say,

01:16:40.340 --> 01:16:42.380
what I can't derive, I don't understand.

01:16:42.380 --> 01:16:44.220
He didn't say, what I can't memorize, I don't understand.

01:16:44.220 --> 01:16:45.060
That's not a question of that.

01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:46.940
It's a question of, for example,

01:16:46.940 --> 01:16:49.500
let's forget the exact, you know,

01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:51.660
weak hypercharges summits.

01:16:51.660 --> 01:16:54.940
You can write down the pseudocode

01:16:54.940 --> 01:16:56.660
of the standard model of logic.

01:16:56.660 --> 01:16:57.820
Absolutely, for sure.

01:16:57.820 --> 01:16:59.500
So that's, first of all,

01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:01.140
I'm talking about people who can't do that.

01:17:01.140 --> 01:17:02.740
Oh, I understand what you mean.

01:17:02.740 --> 01:17:04.340
And I do agree that there's a problem,

01:17:04.340 --> 01:17:08.780
but at the same time, like, I think there's the like,

01:17:08.780 --> 01:17:09.940
should we do the standard,

01:17:09.940 --> 01:17:12.180
should like, just as an intellectual endeavor,

01:17:12.180 --> 01:17:14.020
should we remember, should we pass down

01:17:14.020 --> 01:17:14.900
the things that we've learned,

01:17:14.900 --> 01:17:16.500
we should definitely make sure

01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:17.340
the standard model is not put out.

01:17:17.340 --> 01:17:20.180
I'm saying that the younger people that we're discussing,

01:17:20.180 --> 01:17:23.300
the consequence of not having this reconciliation,

01:17:23.300 --> 01:17:26.380
by the way, of understanding what quantum gravity

01:17:26.380 --> 01:17:30.180
did to this field, is that we have a number of people

01:17:30.180 --> 01:17:33.300
who are not intact in their research careers,

01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:34.580
who are not in a position,

01:17:34.580 --> 01:17:37.460
if the answer came screaming across their field of view,

01:17:37.460 --> 01:17:39.220
they wouldn't necessarily recognize.

01:17:39.220 --> 01:17:41.900
But I would say there's similarly a problem,

01:17:41.900 --> 01:17:43.740
it has nothing to do with quantum gravity,

01:17:43.780 --> 01:17:45.580
which was that the response to all of this

01:17:45.580 --> 01:17:47.700
is that particle physics has become de-forced

01:17:47.700 --> 01:17:48.540
from experiment.

01:17:48.540 --> 01:17:50.380
And the problem is that particle theorists

01:17:50.380 --> 01:17:51.620
don't know what it's going to experiment.

01:17:51.620 --> 01:17:53.420
And that has pushed to the point

01:17:53.420 --> 01:17:56.340
that most young people that I talk to

01:17:56.340 --> 01:17:57.780
who are particle phenomenologists,

01:17:57.780 --> 01:17:59.260
now there are people who previously

01:17:59.260 --> 01:18:01.740
would have known the standard model had a written down.

01:18:01.740 --> 01:18:04.540
Their feeling now is that like, for them to get a job,

01:18:04.540 --> 01:18:05.860
and again, is this actually true

01:18:05.860 --> 01:18:07.100
or just so what they perceive?

01:18:07.100 --> 01:18:08.580
It's probably some of both,

01:18:08.580 --> 01:18:11.060
but they feel they have to have an experiment

01:18:11.060 --> 01:18:12.380
with their name on it,

01:18:12.380 --> 01:18:13.380
because otherwise people will say,

01:18:13.380 --> 01:18:15.020
well, they're not in touch with the real world.

01:18:15.020 --> 01:18:15.860
So let's get,

01:18:15.860 --> 01:18:17.740
we need to get you guys more money.

01:18:17.740 --> 01:18:18.580
That would be fantastic.

01:18:18.580 --> 01:18:19.540
No, that's what we,

01:18:19.540 --> 01:18:20.700
what I always say,

01:18:20.700 --> 01:18:23.300
what we need to do is to give my detractors,

01:18:23.300 --> 01:18:25.100
my people who are not critics,

01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:26.460
but actually assholes,

01:18:26.460 --> 01:18:27.540
more money,

01:18:27.540 --> 01:18:30.260
because what you're seeing is the dynamics

01:18:30.260 --> 01:18:33.180
of hunger game mentality inside of physics.

01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:34.860
And as a result of this,

01:18:34.860 --> 01:18:37.420
we're not able to behave constructively,

01:18:37.420 --> 01:18:39.740
we're not able to behave collegially,

01:18:39.740 --> 01:18:41.420
when we separate ourselves

01:18:41.420 --> 01:18:45.220
so that certain people on stage never encounter critic.

01:18:45.220 --> 01:18:47.780
I was at Seifu in 2011, I believe,

01:18:47.780 --> 01:18:49.820
where Joe Pulczynski and Eva Silverstein

01:18:49.820 --> 01:18:52.300
were talking about string theory in one of the rooms.

01:18:52.300 --> 01:18:54.620
And I went in and I listened to Joe's version

01:18:54.620 --> 01:18:56.460
of the history of string theory and I raised my hand.

01:18:56.460 --> 01:18:59.140
I said, they're like seven or eight things

01:18:59.140 --> 01:19:01.460
that you just said that are not true.

01:19:01.460 --> 01:19:03.660
And I went through them and Joe too is credit.

01:19:03.660 --> 01:19:05.540
I said, yep, yep, that's fair.

01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:06.780
Yeah, that's true.

01:19:06.780 --> 01:19:08.900
That happened the way you said it, not the way I said it.

01:19:08.900 --> 01:19:11.380
And I watched Eva go white, right?

01:19:11.380 --> 01:19:13.060
She was just like, he's gonna have to speak.

01:19:13.060 --> 01:19:15.300
And she had had previously prepared slides

01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:18.100
that duplicated many of the same claims.

01:19:18.100 --> 01:19:19.780
One of which, for example, is that it wasn't

01:19:19.780 --> 01:19:22.380
that we never thought about higher dimensional brains.

01:19:22.380 --> 01:19:23.460
It was called string theory

01:19:23.460 --> 01:19:24.780
because there were actual arguments

01:19:24.780 --> 01:19:26.980
that those higher dimensional brains were guaranteed

01:19:26.980 --> 01:19:28.700
not to be part of the theory.

01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:31.580
And so once you actually go through the reconciliation

01:19:31.580 --> 01:19:34.300
where you say, let's talk about the eight times we were wrong.

01:19:34.300 --> 01:19:36.100
We said that there were finite number of theories,

01:19:36.100 --> 01:19:37.460
then there turned out to be a continuum

01:19:37.460 --> 01:19:39.340
where those things were extreme.

01:19:39.340 --> 01:19:40.860
I can go on and on and on.

01:19:40.860 --> 01:19:45.860
In all of those situations, by not forcing people to say,

01:19:46.060 --> 01:19:47.020
yeah, we were wrong.

01:19:47.020 --> 01:19:49.140
And Joe Pulczynski is a really good example.

01:19:49.140 --> 01:19:50.660
I was pleased to see him on your list,

01:19:50.660 --> 01:19:53.380
not for string theoretic issues or quantum gravity,

01:19:53.380 --> 01:19:55.300
but because of the effective theory.

01:19:55.300 --> 01:19:58.140
And he was a good enough scientist to say,

01:19:58.140 --> 01:20:00.220
you know what, you got me, you're right.

01:20:00.220 --> 01:20:02.100
He also said to me something, which, you know,

01:20:02.100 --> 01:20:03.180
I want to be in the world.

01:20:03.180 --> 01:20:05.340
He said, you, Eric, talk a lot about quantum gravity

01:20:05.340 --> 01:20:06.180
and string theory.

01:20:06.180 --> 01:20:07.820
And sometimes I don't think string theory exists.

01:20:07.820 --> 01:20:08.780
I said, what?

01:20:08.780 --> 01:20:10.780
He said, sometimes I just think we're running subroutines

01:20:10.780 --> 01:20:11.900
for Ed.

01:20:11.900 --> 01:20:14.060
And I thought that that was a profound moment

01:20:14.060 --> 01:20:16.500
that in general, one of the things that happened,

01:20:16.500 --> 01:20:19.140
which you may or may not know or feel or understand,

01:20:19.140 --> 01:20:21.820
is that when you would come up with a new idea,

01:20:21.820 --> 01:20:23.860
in a previous generation, everyone would look around

01:20:23.860 --> 01:20:25.620
and say, well, what does Ed say?

01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:27.940
And it had to do with the fact that people felt

01:20:27.940 --> 01:20:29.820
that Ed was channeling the cosmos,

01:20:29.820 --> 01:20:31.780
like Jimi Hendrix played the guitar differently

01:20:31.780 --> 01:20:33.220
than everybody else.

01:20:33.220 --> 01:20:34.900
And so it was like, well, what would Jimmy say?

01:20:34.900 --> 01:20:35.740
What would Jimmy do?

01:20:35.740 --> 01:20:36.660
What would Jesus do?

01:20:36.660 --> 01:20:38.260
And you can't do that.

01:20:38.260 --> 01:20:40.300
You have to actually say, well, here's my opinion.

01:20:40.660 --> 01:20:45.020
I may be wrong, but the fact is we have to go back

01:20:45.020 --> 01:20:48.060
and say, why do we have this fictitious history

01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:49.380
of the last 40 years?

01:20:49.380 --> 01:20:51.900
And let's also celebrate all the great stuff

01:20:51.900 --> 01:20:54.500
as per your thread and also my arguments

01:20:54.500 --> 01:20:56.740
about the fact that we actually put quantum field theory

01:20:56.740 --> 01:20:57.860
on a more solid basis.

01:20:57.860 --> 01:20:59.700
It's highly geometric.

01:20:59.700 --> 01:21:01.860
And I believe that the geometrization of quantum field

01:21:01.860 --> 01:21:04.060
theory and its divorce from physics

01:21:04.060 --> 01:21:06.620
is one of the great intellectual achievements of our time.

01:21:06.620 --> 01:21:08.500
And it deserves to be celebrated.

01:21:08.500 --> 01:21:09.860
It's just like wrong way, Kerrigan.

01:21:09.860 --> 01:21:11.500
You think that you're going to end up as Lindbergh,

01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:13.460
but you end up going the wrong direction.

01:21:13.460 --> 01:21:16.220
All right, well, this has been the end of round one

01:21:18.380 --> 01:21:21.780
of this thriller in San Diego.

01:21:21.780 --> 01:21:23.420
I want to thank both of you guys.

01:21:23.420 --> 01:21:25.820
And hopefully we can do a round two,

01:21:25.820 --> 01:21:28.420
but actually I'm more interested in doing something,

01:21:28.420 --> 01:21:31.340
not on camera with you guys and just going through

01:21:31.340 --> 01:21:32.940
some really fun physics.

01:21:32.940 --> 01:21:36.980
I learned so much from you, both of you guys.

01:21:37.020 --> 01:21:40.340
And I think Dan is really a role model

01:21:40.340 --> 01:21:42.380
for many young physicists.

01:21:42.380 --> 01:21:44.420
I said it in the previous podcast,

01:21:44.420 --> 01:21:46.300
never have I been so glad to be a goner,

01:21:46.300 --> 01:21:48.580
to be a thief, to steal your life from other universities.

01:21:48.580 --> 01:21:50.580
Cause I think you really do exemplify

01:21:50.580 --> 01:21:53.020
what a theorist or what a physicist should be.

01:21:53.020 --> 01:21:54.500
Not a theorist, an experiment.

01:21:54.500 --> 01:21:57.420
You're interested in both and you're curious.

01:21:57.420 --> 01:21:58.740
And then that means so much to me.

01:21:58.740 --> 01:22:02.780
And Eric, of course, is always so delightful

01:22:02.780 --> 01:22:04.620
because you know, I used to say,

01:22:04.620 --> 01:22:05.980
the way to put a physicist down and say,

01:22:05.980 --> 01:22:09.060
well, he or she knows the history of the field really well.

01:22:09.060 --> 01:22:11.300
But you put your money where your mouth is.

01:22:11.300 --> 01:22:12.540
You're very devoted to it.

01:22:12.540 --> 01:22:14.740
I don't think it's for personal attention.

01:22:14.740 --> 01:22:16.580
I don't think it's for, you know,

01:22:16.580 --> 01:22:19.540
the satisfaction of fighting the previous wars

01:22:19.540 --> 01:22:20.900
as generals often do.

01:22:20.900 --> 01:22:23.140
But I think it's for the sake of heaven

01:22:23.140 --> 01:22:25.340
in the sense that we are trying to understand

01:22:25.340 --> 01:22:26.580
a universe that we came into.

01:22:26.580 --> 01:22:27.940
And we are like those fish

01:22:27.940 --> 01:22:29.980
that don't really know what the water is.

01:22:29.980 --> 01:22:32.020
And you guys helped clarify, for me,

01:22:32.020 --> 01:22:34.380
simple experimental cosmology.

01:22:34.380 --> 01:22:36.980
So now I want you guys to say one thing about Dan.

01:22:36.980 --> 01:22:38.620
Yes, yes, sir, yes, please.

01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:41.420
I also think that people often on the internet

01:22:41.420 --> 01:22:42.980
would post these popcorn memes.

01:22:42.980 --> 01:22:44.740
Oh, people are going to conflict.

01:22:44.740 --> 01:22:47.300
And the reason that we don't get great fights on the internet

01:22:47.300 --> 01:22:48.380
that are actually productive

01:22:48.380 --> 01:22:50.460
and that help us learn about the subject

01:22:50.460 --> 01:22:52.740
is because we don't have a sense of Queensborough rules.

01:22:52.740 --> 01:22:54.580
And one of the things that I just think is terrific

01:22:54.580 --> 01:22:57.220
about Dan, who I've never met before,

01:22:57.220 --> 01:22:59.420
is that I had a high level of trust

01:23:00.460 --> 01:23:02.900
that he was focused on the physics

01:23:02.900 --> 01:23:06.300
and not on scoring points, dunking and dragging.

01:23:06.300 --> 01:23:08.860
I think people don't remember what a critic is.

01:23:08.860 --> 01:23:11.340
I believe that Dan has a certain sense of my critic

01:23:11.340 --> 01:23:12.620
and I his.

01:23:12.620 --> 01:23:15.020
But the point is not to blind him

01:23:15.020 --> 01:23:17.740
or do small knuckle manipulations.

01:23:17.740 --> 01:23:19.940
Iron chic jumping, turnbuckle.

01:23:19.940 --> 01:23:23.140
The key point is if you want really good conflict,

01:23:23.140 --> 01:23:24.860
you have to establish Queensborough rules

01:23:24.860 --> 01:23:27.020
by people who are not going to go for the jug killer,

01:23:27.020 --> 01:23:29.340
bite off an ear when they're in one of these things.

01:23:29.340 --> 01:23:30.500
And it's been an absolute pleasure

01:23:30.500 --> 01:23:31.900
to come down and have this conversation.

01:23:31.900 --> 01:23:34.820
So touch gloves, Dan, anything else you wanna say?

01:23:34.820 --> 01:23:38.220
I would say, I mean, I do, even that thread,

01:23:38.220 --> 01:23:40.580
I would say part of the role of a critic

01:23:40.580 --> 01:23:42.220
is not to be negative all the time.

01:23:42.220 --> 01:23:44.420
I mean, the real value of the critic

01:23:44.420 --> 01:23:46.940
is by being negative at times,

01:23:46.940 --> 01:23:49.180
when they're positive, it gives real meaning.

01:23:49.180 --> 01:23:52.780
And so I view that as a, nobody's being positive up there

01:23:52.780 --> 01:23:54.860
and let me be positive out in the world.

01:23:54.860 --> 01:23:57.140
And look forward to big things to come from Dan

01:23:57.140 --> 01:24:00.580
and another episode with Eric coming out soon.

01:24:00.580 --> 01:24:02.940
For now, Brian Keating joining you

01:24:02.940 --> 01:24:04.940
from University of California, San Diego.

01:24:04.940 --> 01:24:07.300
We're blessed to have brilliant colleagues

01:24:07.300 --> 01:24:09.860
like Dan Green and friends of the show,

01:24:09.860 --> 01:24:10.820
like Eric Wineside.

01:24:10.820 --> 01:24:12.740
Stay tuned, more great episodes coming up.

01:24:12.740 --> 01:24:14.980
Suzy Sheehy is coming out this week

01:24:14.980 --> 01:24:18.140
and a special surprise guest coming next week.

01:24:18.140 --> 01:24:20.180
So stay tuned for now, signing off.
