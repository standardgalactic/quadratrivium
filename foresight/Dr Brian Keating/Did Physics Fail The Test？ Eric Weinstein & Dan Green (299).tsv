0	2360	Let's do it, as you see us on the screen.
2360	5360	It's just going to be the center panel.
5360	5860	Yep.
5860	6840	All right.
6840	10920	Welcome to a special episode of the Impossible
10920	14320	Podcast, which is a series of great scholars
14320	17520	that I have had on the podcast both multiple times now
17520	21080	and green, Professor and colleague here at UC San Diego.
21080	24080	And my friend, Longtime, most popular.
24080	26960	I think that's a great connection.
26960	29120	I'm at the portal podcast.
29120	34560	And the physics who recently had a very, very popular episode
34560	37480	said that we called physics is fine.
37480	39640	And it was based on a Twitter thread
39640	43800	storm that came out at the end of December in which Dan
43800	45400	highlighted discoveries in physics
45400	48280	that had not been really rewarded with the accolade
48280	51360	of the Nobel Prize, yet, perhaps never,
51360	55200	but at least as of the moment, had not been rewarded
55480	57800	with that particular remuneration.
57800	60720	And there's been a lot of controversy, as I said,
60720	64920	around the description of physics as having stagnated.
64920	69280	Most forcefully or vocally by Sabina Hossenfelder, also
69280	72520	eight-time guest on the podcast, just behind Eric's record
72520	74640	set for this particular event.
74640	77440	But I wanted to have both gentlemen here together
77440	80840	to discuss the future of physics as they see it
80840	83680	and what's right with physics, what we could do with physics,
83680	85600	or what we could change or modify,
85600	88920	what opportunities there are, and sort of moderate that
88920	92400	from the perspective of a simple experimental cosmologist
92400	94280	and my perspective on things.
94280	96800	So we're going to talk about particle physics,
96800	98360	experiment theory.
98360	100280	We're going to talk about unification of forces
100280	101480	in fields, perhaps.
101480	105400	And we're going to have it, as I said, a nice clean fight.
105400	108120	We're going to go TOE to TOE.
108120	108960	You did it.
108960	109440	I did it.
109440	110240	I made that joke.
110240	111240	You didn't think I would.
111280	113920	So I think I'll start with Dan, just
113920	117160	to recapitulate from our previous episode that aired last week
117160	121760	and find it, and the channel archives called Physics is Fine.
121760	125800	What was the motivation for that particular tweet storm?
125800	127840	Yeah, so thanks for having me on.
127840	130680	It's nice to get a chance to talk to both of you.
130680	133320	So the motivation behind the thread
133320	135640	was to articulate some of the things
135640	140320	that I picked up on being an active researcher that I thought
140320	144400	were important events for me in understanding how the world works
144400	147880	and making progress in clearly observational topics
147880	152560	like cosmology, but also important theoretical ideas that
152560	155160	had a huge impact on how I see the world that I didn't think
155160	159400	were always well understood or appreciated by people,
159400	162080	like even other researchers outside of their own fields.
162080	164040	So it was just to kind of communicate
164040	166360	the value of what had been happening.
166360	169160	And one of the reasons for that is that as a researcher,
169200	173120	it's really important to know what am I aiming for,
173120	176640	like what would be a result that would really stand out
176640	179320	amongst the best results the past five years.
179320	181360	We'd all like to be Einstein, but just for me,
181360	184600	I just you can't always, you won't always achieve those,
184600	188560	but maybe having a hierarchy of results in your mind
188560	191480	is really important for just gauging where progress,
191480	194440	what counts as progress, what kind of progress is going on.
195440	200200	And Eric, you've been interacting,
200200	204400	you've been interacting and engaging with this said tweet
204400	207160	and also with our friend Sabina and Martin Bauer,
207160	209680	who generously provided a book called No Bell Dreams,
209680	211320	which is somewhere around here.
211320	212480	What was your reaction to this?
212480	215760	You had sort of a provocative comment
215760	217960	that we should just get past the point
217960	220480	that yes, there's been a lot of progress in condensed matter
220480	222840	physics and theoretical astrophysics,
222840	224440	experimental cosmology.
224440	226720	What are you most interested in doing
226720	229600	to move the conversation forward from your perspective?
229600	230680	Thanks for asking.
230680	235040	So I'd like to do this in the click-baity kind
235040	236760	of thumbnail sketches.
236760	240320	I was outraged, Dan, frankly, by this tweet storm.
240320	243760	Sorry, it's gonna get a little, a little, fantastic.
243760	245840	I'm bored by all the opening moves.
245840	249200	We have a suite of moves where somebody says
249200	250800	there's a crisis in fundamental physics
250800	253080	and then somebody mishears it and says,
253080	254960	you have no idea what's going on in material science.
254960	256360	It's never been a more exciting time.
256360	257400	You say, that's not what I said.
257400	258600	Well, who's to say what's fundamental?
258600	260480	Is cosmology fundamental?
260480	263200	So this is the sort of weird dance
263200	264640	that people get into at the beginning.
264640	266800	And I've said, I'd rather just say Roy Lopez's
266800	269840	spasky variation and get to the middle game
269840	271840	rather than wasting time on the intro.
271840	273880	So I think it would be appropriate,
273880	277640	given that I'm not a physicist, to seed a bunch of things,
277640	280080	first of all, being that I'm not a physicist.
280080	284920	I think that the issue is not about physics in the large.
284920	289080	It's really about the sort of core central issue,
289080	290880	which people are very squeamish about now,
290880	292800	because nobody wants to say that any field
292800	294280	is any more important than any other,
294280	295840	which is ridiculous.
295840	298660	There is a central core of fundamental physics,
298660	301720	which is the thing that scratches the itch we have.
301720	303380	When we're not physicists, we wanna know,
303380	304220	what is the universe?
304220	305200	Who am I?
305200	306480	Where, why am I here?
306480	307480	How does the world work?
307480	309600	What is this place made of?
309600	312480	And those questions have stagnated,
312480	315240	and I'm sort of somewhat arbitrarily,
315240	316400	but not that arbitrarily,
316400	319440	tying that to February 1st of 1973
319440	323240	with the publication of the Kobayashi-Moscowa paper,
323240	326280	enlarging the Kibibo angle to three generations.
327520	332480	And I believe there are eight particle theorists left
332480	334360	on Earth who have won a Nobel Prize.
334360	337480	Now that also causes a certain variation in the opening,
337480	338680	because somebody will say, well,
338720	340640	you seem to be very hung up on the Nobel Prize.
340640	341480	It's like, no.
341480	342320	Not more than me.
343680	347800	But the fact is that the Nobel Prize
347800	351480	is a somewhat conservative measure of progress.
351480	353400	And as a conservative measure of progress,
353400	355640	when you're down to your last eight people
355640	358000	who have proven that they are physicists
358000	361100	by being able to make contact with reality at that level,
362560	364280	50 years is a long time.
364280	367120	I think the longest recent drought of this kind
367120	371600	is between 1928 and 47 with the advent of QED by Dirac
371600	373720	as the first real quantum field theory
373720	376840	before the sort of primitive renormalization program
376840	379920	came in and cleared up the ability to compute.
379920	383080	So I absolutely celebrate Dan's tweet storm.
383080	384840	I think that it had lots of great papers,
384840	386600	many of which I knew nothing about.
386600	389000	So I educated myself and I got a chance
389000	393000	to look at Dan's work a bit.
393000	394960	But that said, one of the things I think
394960	396160	that tweet storm did,
396200	398920	and I think Dan acknowledged it as much,
398920	403920	is that it didn't clearly state the results
405640	408560	that would constitute unambiguous change
408560	409520	in fundamental physics.
409520	411960	That is, what is the field content of the world?
411960	414160	What stuff is it that's running around?
414160	416760	Are there new things that we haven't figured out?
417840	420040	What constitutes the new interactions
420040	421200	of the stuff that we have
421200	422500	and the stuff that may come to be?
422500	424560	And the other issue of unification
425560	427760	would be spaces.
427760	430480	So we currently have something called space time
430480	432320	and it's not clear whether there is a problem
432320	433560	with space time itself.
433560	437600	So I would say that Dan did a great service
437600	439080	talking about all the sorts of things
439080	440400	that are not in crisis.
440400	443200	And I wish to seed instantly
443200	445120	that it is not that physics is in crisis,
445120	447800	which is the thing that everybody can understand easily,
447800	452560	but it is the core central issue of what physics can be.
452560	454680	It's meant to be that it excites our imaginations
454680	457480	and our passions, answers philosophical questions
457480	459760	that is in a prolonged state of,
459760	463000	and I would say a necessary self-inflicted crisis.
463000	464240	Well, just before Dan,
464240	465720	you get the opportunity to address that.
465720	467480	So I recently, are you familiar with this essay
467480	470960	by David Foster Wallace called This Is Water?
470960	472080	You're drinking some vodka,
472080	474120	so hopefully you're familiar with it.
474120	477280	So it's a parable of these two fish that are young fish
477280	479280	and they're in the ocean, they're swimming around,
479280	481480	and all of a sudden an older fish comes by
481520	484040	and says, hey boys, how's the water?
484040	485560	He goes on his way.
485560	487520	And then the two fish look at each other,
487520	490480	one says the other one, what the hell is water?
490480	491520	Is that possible?
491520	494080	Let me ask Dan, are we obsessed with space time?
494080	495880	Are we in space time in the same way
495880	497480	that these fish are in water?
497480	502480	And are we rightfully to be maybe ashamed
502600	505360	or view it as something to be dispensed with altogether
505360	508040	as I think Einstein or Lorenz or both of them
508040	511040	or neither of them or Nimas have claimed?
511040	511880	What is space time?
511880	514720	Why is that sort of the pinnacle
514720	517160	and how can you see that getting under Eric's skin?
518720	520120	Yeah, I mean, for sure,
520120	523560	that's one of the great questions of science.
523560	528360	So we think that space time probably emerges from something
528360	531320	in a lot of examples we've studied like strength theory
531320	533960	where our ultimate hope for resolution
533960	538160	of the singularity at the beginning of time
538160	540520	is probably something non-geometric.
540520	542280	If we understand what's going on there,
542280	544480	it will not be in terms of geometry
544480	547840	at least of the kind of space time we experience.
548680	551280	I think the thing I would say is in response to you,
551280	553520	are we unnecessarily obsessed with it?
553520	556600	I do think that there are questions of this nature,
556600	560320	like what happened before the Big Bang?
560320	564880	And some of those questions we don't have the tools to answer.
564880	566760	We don't have data to help guide us.
566760	569520	And even if someone writes down a theory that works,
570040	571240	we may have no way to test it.
571240	572680	Someone can come up with another theory.
572680	574480	And so there is a lot of like,
574480	576600	we're not guaranteed that we're gonna be able to answer
576600	580560	all the questions that are deeply held questions
580560	583120	of humanity going back to eons.
583120	585320	But I do think that like,
585320	587680	so there are aspects of these questions.
587680	590120	I don't think we're guaranteed that we can make progress
590120	592600	on all the questions we'd like to.
592600	597440	And what happens at space time when it seems to be,
597480	600360	but the kind of thing we experience on our scale,
600360	603760	does it continue to exist down to these scales?
603760	605320	We'd love to be able to answer that question,
605320	609440	but I also don't think we necessarily are promised
609440	610880	that we'll ever have answers,
610880	614160	or at least in hundreds of years time scale.
614160	616560	And so I don't see that as the benchmark
616560	619200	at which all decisions of progress have to be made.
620440	623760	You know, I guess when I hear that,
623760	626120	I check it against things that I believe.
626120	628760	So one, when you say geometric,
628760	630360	it's not that it will be non-geometric,
630360	632240	it's that it won't be the specific geometry
632240	635080	and you sort of corrected that mid-flight.
635080	639240	So if Albert Einstein told us to embrace
639240	640840	semi-Romanian geometry,
640840	644360	it's not simply going to be a semi-Romanian manifold,
644360	647240	which is basically four degrees of freedom
647240	651720	together with one set of rulers and four rulers
651720	654440	for each degree of freedom and six protractors between them.
654440	658240	So you have 10 variables that get chosen by an equation.
658240	660000	And then that thing,
660000	662680	to the extent that I understand your point,
662680	664680	it's that there are these singularities.
664680	667360	One is at the beginning of time, if you will,
667360	670560	in the standard Friedman-Robertson-Walker model.
670560	674000	And the other one is at the base of a black hole,
674000	675960	which is the Schwarzschild singularity,
675960	677960	and one modern interpretation
677960	680880	is that the singularities result from crimes and sins
680880	682840	that we don't even know we've committed.
682840	685880	And so we're trying to figure out what to do as penance
685880	687320	so as to remove these singularities.
687320	691000	But if I listen to what you're saying very carefully,
691000	694160	I see something which I'm very alarmed by,
694160	697720	which is you're not suspicious,
697720	700240	either one of you, enough of the language,
700240	703800	before speaks to one dimension of time.
703800	709440	And only R1 has an ordering in the absence of other structure.
709440	711920	R2, R3, R4 don't have such a thing.
711920	713920	So when there is an arrow of time,
713920	715640	it makes good sense, ordinarily,
715640	720120	to say nothing of pardon, to speak of before.
720120	723720	But if the ultimate structure, as I believe,
723720	726080	has multiple dimensions of time,
726080	730520	you will find that the crutch of saying initial conditions
730520	734040	has to be replaced by something like boundary conditions.
734040	735600	And in such a situation,
735600	737520	one of the things that's really interesting to me
737520	740840	is that we have the Lagrangian, the equations,
740840	743760	the field content, which is the science.
743760	746920	But we also have this way of talking around it.
746920	749040	And the way in which we have of talking around it
749040	751440	carries a tremendous amount of weight.
751440	753480	And a lot of that, I think,
753480	758080	is grooving each generation to fail as its successors failed,
758080	759840	because what we're doing is we're putting
759840	762400	a tremendous amount of pressure saying,
762400	765880	if you don't learn to speak the way we do,
765880	768280	you will not be able to survive to adulthood
768280	771200	to have your own thesis students.
771200	774720	And therefore, you had better learn to talk as we do.
774720	776080	And I think that that's one of the things
776080	777360	that I'm very concerned about.
777360	778960	I don't believe that before
778960	781760	is as simple as we're making out to be.
781760	784360	So I guess I would push back on that.
784360	786520	I mean, I don't think it's, I mean,
786520	790000	we can use, it's helpful to use everyday language
790000	793040	and then add, okay, it could be different, right?
793040	797040	Like, it's helpful to start from the things we know are true.
797040	798560	And we can ask questions like,
798560	800480	could there be extra dimensions of time
800480	804040	or even just the evolution from is,
804040	805560	do we know that quantum mechanics
805560	808240	is the only possible way that the world could work?
808240	809600	There are lots of people,
809600	811200	and I include myself in them,
811200	813760	that are interested in pushing the boundaries.
813760	818400	But it also helps to start from a place of what we know.
818400	820280	Like, I think there are plenty of people
820280	822440	who throw away literally all the physics
822440	823840	and they go, well, I don't wanna be constrained
823840	825440	by the structures of physics.
825440	827800	And it really hurts their careers
827800	829160	because they can't,
829160	831200	they don't even understand basic physics
831200	834000	which stops them from being able to make meaningful progress.
834000	834960	Because if you can't,
834960	837620	if you can't explain what we already understand,
837620	840880	you can't extend the structure in new and interesting ways.
840880	843640	So with the example of multiple time directions,
843640	846520	like people do consider this like in,
846520	850320	you know, well-respected theoretical physics groups
850320	852160	for many different motivations,
852240	855720	either purely just as a tool to understand physics,
855720	857080	but in other cases, really,
857080	858400	because they're interested in like,
858400	860760	what would it mean and what are the implications?
860760	864240	But since we, like, all of our life experience
864240	865760	is still rooted in one time,
865760	868160	like I think it's still reasonable to say,
869760	871140	for sure, you have to recover that.
871140	872680	But at the same time, I don't think,
872680	876160	like, I think it's good to establish that like,
876160	879340	we have a language that works well
879340	882000	for describing a lot of the universe
882000	885280	and that we talk about how we break that,
885280	887120	those things in a controlled way.
887120	891560	So generalizations of say, like number of time dimensions
891560	893760	or say changes to the rules even,
893760	895480	so we're not even doing quantum mechanics,
895480	897800	like those things are really interesting directions,
897800	899120	but they're very constrained
899120	902080	because most of them don't even describe daily life
902080	903480	in any meaningful way.
903480	907080	Like most mutations in biology lead to things
907080	908920	getting far worse rather than better.
908920	910880	It's a rare mutation that works.
910880	913280	But what you've said is not actually true in science.
913280	916520	It's often the case that people make huge breakthroughs
916520	918720	because they don't understand the errors
918720	920080	of a previous generation.
920080	923440	So for example, you had the stray hydrogen atom
923440	925720	on the nucleotides that was in all the books
925720	926680	in the wrong place.
926680	929200	It happened that Watson and Crick were in an office
929200	933240	with Jerry Donahue who said, all the books are wrong.
933240	935000	And if you look in the double helix,
935000	937480	it's about a page and a half or something
937480	940320	before Jim Watson figures out the hydrogen bonds
940320	944280	that explain the Chargaff-Equimolar relations.
944280	946920	And you have similar things if you were,
946920	949840	in the 1940s, trying to study electromagnetism
949840	952360	and its effect on electrons,
952360	953640	you would almost certainly think
953640	955640	that was the electric and magnetic fields
955640	959280	that impacted an electron being passed around the solenoid.
959280	961320	And surprisingly enough, in the 50s,
961320	963600	we learned that there were classical consequences
963600	966600	of electromagnetism that we had really wrong
966600	969840	because we'd put all of our weight, if you will,
969840	972640	on the E and B fields of electromagnetism
972640	975120	and not on the electromagnetic four potential,
975120	977280	which in fact is something,
977280	979480	which is not a convenience product meant
979480	982440	to recover classical electromagnetism.
982440	987120	It in fact has weight, as was shown by Bohm and Aronov.
989000	993440	I mean, I don't disagree with that point of view.
993440	996400	I would just say that there's not,
996400	1000160	I don't think there's a lack of contrarianism in the field.
1000160	1001960	And I don't think that that,
1001960	1004400	I don't think there's people feel
1004400	1006880	they're unable to take risks.
1006880	1009440	I think the problem is that like,
1009440	1013120	there's no, if you don't understand the starting point,
1013120	1015360	it's very difficult to take risks
1015360	1017880	that are in a productive way, right?
1017880	1021560	So if I don't understand why we think the world,
1021560	1024120	how the world works in this room,
1024120	1025600	it's very difficult to think,
1025600	1026960	well, what are the limitations
1026960	1030240	of how I break the structures that I understand?
1030240	1032560	So I would say, people understanding,
1035320	1038080	trying to propose generalizations
1038080	1040000	in all kinds of directions,
1040000	1042320	almost all of them are doomed to fail from the start.
1042320	1045000	And I think many people were like,
1045000	1048800	well, that's people trying to put unnecessary constraints
1048800	1050840	on me, I'm a free thinker.
1050840	1052400	It's like, no, that's not people trying to put it.
1052400	1054320	That's reality putting constraints on you.
1054320	1056360	And I think that's, we have to separate,
1056360	1058480	there's definitely sociological challenges
1058480	1060840	for young people to do really creative things,
1060840	1062280	but there's also just reality
1062280	1065240	that presents a real challenge to being super creative.
1065240	1067800	I just have a completely different impression
1067800	1070880	of your field from outside, which is people come to me
1070880	1072400	and they say, I can't afford to work
1072400	1074480	on what I really wanna work on.
1074480	1075920	I don't believe many of the things
1075920	1078080	that I'm being fed with my mother's milk.
1079480	1081160	I can understand them,
1081240	1084520	but every time I deviate more than a certain amount
1084520	1087640	or in a way that is not thought well of by the community,
1087640	1089920	all conversations die off.
1089920	1092480	I'm cautioned that this is an extremely brave thing to do
1092480	1095720	in the sense of bravery is stupidity.
1095720	1099040	And I think that what you're saying is a hope and a wish,
1099040	1101520	which in a few cases,
1101520	1104080	I don't wanna say that it's 100% across the board,
1104080	1106000	but I do believe that in part,
1107360	1109280	we don't have this freedom in this field
1109280	1111000	and we don't have the freedom to continue
1111000	1112840	to get engagement from the community
1112840	1114360	because in general,
1114360	1116960	we get these mega programs that are cropping up.
1116960	1118160	And in the mega programs,
1118160	1119560	there are all sorts of assumptions
1119560	1123000	that have been layered on, which are not proven.
1123000	1126520	And I would love to apply this rule
1126520	1129840	to some of the major mega programs and say,
1129840	1131840	hey, you're in the wrong number of dimensions,
1131840	1133160	you've got the wrong signature,
1133160	1135360	you've got the wrong symmetries,
1135360	1137680	you've got the wrong field content.
1137680	1141320	And it becomes this thing where the person then says,
1141320	1143440	oh, no, no, no, it's a toy theory.
1143440	1146240	I'm in a small Euclidean number of dimensions
1146240	1148680	with SU2 is the symmetries of the universe.
1148680	1150440	And I'm super symmetric.
1150440	1152200	I'm doing all of this stuff,
1152200	1156040	which is not the physical world that we live in
1156040	1158040	so far as we understand it.
1158040	1159920	And the idea is that that person is saying,
1159920	1164000	I wish to suspend the normal rules of science
1164000	1166520	because I'm doing toy stuff in order to learn
1166520	1169480	about the structures that are going to elucidate
1169480	1172320	the actual one physical universe that we're in.
1172320	1175880	Now, when you do that, I understand that.
1175880	1177920	But what we're talking about is something
1177920	1179520	like scientific immunity.
1179520	1181960	And if you've ever met somebody with diplomatic immunity,
1181960	1183520	some of them have the feeling that they can park
1183520	1186440	wherever they want to and they don't have to pay fines
1186440	1188800	and that they're not subject to the laws of the land
1188800	1189880	that they inhabit.
1189880	1191640	And what I'm trying to say is,
1191640	1193880	you cannot have these mega programs
1194880	1199560	casually imposing the strictest expectations
1199560	1201720	on its competitors and then giving itself
1201720	1204400	a permanent free pass to go on for decades
1204400	1206080	and decades about nothing.
1206080	1209760	Well, just to push back with loving respect.
1209760	1212480	Sorry, I have two actual physicists against one non-physicist.
1212480	1213320	I like my own.
1213320	1215560	I know, but you're an honorary physicist.
1215560	1216400	I'm sorry.
1216400	1218920	I'm sorry to tell you, you're an honorary physicist.
1218920	1221800	So, you're taking basically the opposite point
1221800	1222960	if I'm wrong, correct me,
1223160	1226560	but of this guy up here, not Weinstein, but Einstein,
1226560	1228680	who never thought any of his predictions
1228680	1231040	would be verifiable and yet they proved
1231040	1235320	to be very, very useful approximations, toy models.
1235320	1236320	Look at the Schwartzschild.
1236320	1239120	I mean, we already mentioned the Schwartzschild Singularity.
1239120	1241960	That was thought to be completely impractical,
1241960	1243240	never detectable.
1243240	1247360	Einstein subsequently also disavowed the detectability
1247360	1249680	of gravitational waves, gravitational lensing
1249680	1251600	and yet it was remarkably prescient
1251600	1254040	and that the toy model works in, you know,
1254040	1257640	basically 99.999% of all situations
1257640	1259280	where we could ever hope to apply it.
1259280	1261440	So, toy models are extremely powerful
1261440	1263600	and just to add on to that,
1263600	1265360	you and I were talking before Dan came in
1265360	1268120	about, you know, string theory in that very realm.
1268920	1271400	You know, sometimes it is useful to take a,
1271400	1272280	and again, I'm not speaking
1272280	1275440	as a simple experimental cosmologist, not a theorist,
1275440	1277440	but to take a toy model or take something
1277440	1280120	that we know works in certain situations
1280120	1283200	like the Klein-Gordon equation, which it doesn't apply,
1283200	1284880	unless I'm wrong to any real particles,
1284880	1287840	but it is useful to apply in a way
1287840	1289600	of generating other solutions.
1289600	1292080	Well, it sort of does with modifications.
1292080	1295040	With an idealized modification.
1295040	1296280	That's proving my point.
1296280	1297120	It's a toy model.
1297120	1298560	So what's wrong with toy models?
1298560	1299680	We get a lot of mileage.
1299680	1300840	Nothing is wrong with toy models.
1300840	1302600	You're saying that you're being excluded
1302600	1304840	or maybe not part of the physics program
1304840	1306840	unless you engage in something that...
1306840	1309360	I don't think that, this is just uncomfortable
1309360	1312320	because it's like, let me begin by saying,
1312320	1315320	string theory can't hurt anyone, right?
1315320	1317720	There's, string theory is a set of ideas.
1317720	1320000	It's a constellation of hypotheses
1320000	1321320	and it's a place to play.
1321320	1322440	There's nothing wrong with string theory
1322440	1324200	nor loop quantum gravity.
1324200	1327360	The problem is with, and I don't want to put it all
1327360	1328320	on string theories.
1328320	1330840	The problem is quantum gravity sociology,
1330840	1333480	which has blown a physics-shaped hole
1334560	1338280	in fundamental physics and replaced it
1338320	1340320	with a set of double standards
1340320	1342720	in which I want to know, what are the rules?
1342720	1345280	If the rules are, we all get to play,
1345280	1348000	then hot, hot diggity dog, let's all play.
1348000	1351920	And if the rules are, we should be very careful
1351920	1353320	that things agree with experiment
1353320	1355920	in any attempt to talk about something
1355920	1358920	as, that is violated, you know,
1358920	1361040	like as soon as Dirac finds that A times B
1361040	1362840	is not equal to B times A
1362840	1364040	when he tries to take the square root
1364040	1367320	of your Klein-Gordon equation, you know,
1367600	1369040	it's a short period of time before he says,
1369040	1371240	well, maybe A and B aren't numbers, they're matrices.
1371240	1373320	And then it's like, okay, so you did something
1373320	1376120	that was wrong, that didn't make any sense.
1376120	1378440	And then it did make sense later.
1378440	1382520	The problem that I have is that we have one set of players
1382520	1384840	that is functioning in some sense
1384840	1386680	as both the referees and a team.
1386680	1389360	So imagine that you're playing in the NFL
1389360	1392800	and you've got, the footlocker sends a team.
1392800	1394200	So all their employees are dressed
1394200	1396400	in vertical black and white stripes.
1396480	1398600	And they take the field, they're not particularly talented,
1398600	1399440	but the one thing that they have is-
1399440	1402840	It could be worse than on Sunday's supermodel final call.
1402840	1405680	What they do is that they start saying, you know,
1405680	1410640	off sides, why do you guys get to do this?
1410640	1412440	You're not, you're playing on the field,
1412440	1414160	you're not in a position to do that.
1414160	1416560	The problem is the cancerous sociology
1416560	1418280	of quantum field theory,
1418280	1422440	because this field is given excuses that the rest are not,
1422440	1427440	and it imposes the most strict attempts to impose
1427800	1430160	like scientific falsifiability.
1430160	1432400	And to tell people that you're out, you're out, you're out.
1432400	1435160	Well, 70 years later, after Bryce Dewitt
1435160	1439120	enters an anti-gravity competition with his famous essay,
1439120	1442320	we're still wrestling with a product that doesn't ship,
1442320	1444480	which is imposing standards on other fields.
1444480	1447360	And it's really important to blow that up in our lifetime
1447360	1448800	so that we can all move forward together.
1448800	1451160	So I actually celebrate what you're saying
1451160	1452640	about toy models.
1452640	1454920	I just wanna make sure that we don't have
1454920	1457120	scientific immunity for quantum gravity.
1457120	1459680	Well, I just wanna point out that Bryce Dewitt's book
1459680	1462180	on anti-gravity is so engaging
1462180	1464160	that you just can't put it down.
1464160	1467720	Dan, I wanna ask you, are we having a discussion
1467720	1470120	about sociology, or are we gonna talk about
1470120	1473040	the actual ideas behind these issues?
1473040	1475360	Because when you and I spoke, I said,
1475360	1477120	when you guys get to, I don't know what you guys do
1477120	1479120	over there in theory, but the bottom line,
1479160	1481400	someone's gotta keep an eye on you.
1481400	1484000	You know, we don't pick a person,
1484000	1486600	we don't pick a field when we wanna hire a young professor.
1486600	1487520	We want to hire you.
1487520	1489080	I was part, you know, the milieu,
1489080	1490400	I didn't actually, I wasn't on the committee,
1490400	1491520	but it was part of that milieu.
1491520	1493560	So I didn't say, oh, I really want someone who,
1493560	1495800	you know, has worked on string theory causes.
1495800	1499180	No, it's sort of a target of opportunity in some cases.
1499180	1501080	We were stealing you away from another university.
1501080	1504080	But the point is, is the sociology inside
1504080	1506880	the host organism, or is it something that is perceived
1506880	1509680	as being, afflicting it from outside, from an outside.
1509680	1512520	So I'm gonna agree with Eric in some ways,
1512520	1515960	and disagree in others, but let me, let me, let me,
1515960	1516800	let's start with more,
1516800	1517640	Must you agree?
1517640	1520600	I'll start where we agree, which is like,
1520600	1523700	so the problem when a field gets too big
1523700	1526880	is that it doesn't have to refer outside, right?
1526880	1528040	And that's, I think, what you're getting at,
1528040	1529640	which is like, we make our own rules,
1529640	1532520	we play by our own rules, and I never have to make contact
1532520	1534840	with, not just with nature, but the rest of the world, right?
1534880	1537960	I'm big enough, and you know, we can go to conferences
1537960	1540400	with a thousand people, and never talk to anyone
1540400	1541600	who's spoken a different language,
1541600	1543240	or thought about another problem.
1543240	1547400	So I think, I'm saying that because what I really see
1547400	1549800	is makes the difference most of the time
1549800	1552760	between the areas where the toy model makes progress,
1552760	1554160	where the people working on the toy model
1554160	1556880	really are meaningfully moving the field forward,
1556880	1560400	is their ability to both what they're working on
1560400	1563700	connects to other fields, but they're also able
1563740	1566060	to understand what other fields need from them,
1566060	1568140	and how their toy models are addressing that, right?
1568140	1571300	So for someone working on, let's say,
1571300	1573380	quantum field theory in two dimensions,
1573380	1576660	like, you could do it in such a way that's like,
1576660	1579140	why are these people wasting all their time?
1579140	1580500	But then there are other people that are going,
1580500	1582460	that were working on quantum field theory in two dimensions
1582460	1584620	who were like, condensed matter physicists,
1584620	1586780	and they were like, you know, no, we're working on this
1586780	1589100	because these are solvable models of phase transitions
1589100	1590380	that I can make in materia,
1590500	1594460	and it's the ability to communicate outside of your area
1594460	1598140	that's really important for the health of the health field,
1598140	1602380	and to keep those toy models coming in contact with nature,
1602380	1603220	right?
1603220	1604060	If you're not interacting with the people
1604060	1607660	for whom your toy model is supposed to be making contact,
1607660	1609500	then it really is useless, right?
1609500	1611900	If you're not, I mean, maybe it'll be useful eventually
1611900	1612740	someone 100 years later.
1612740	1614180	I don't think it's useless.
1614180	1619060	But well, but I do think it's valuable to both parties,
1619060	1621060	the people who are more in touch with nature
1621060	1623340	and the people who are just trying to make progress
1623340	1626260	to communicate with each other in a productive way.
1626260	1628540	And where I'll agree with you is that,
1628540	1629980	and I'm not just gonna say string theory,
1629980	1632140	I think many fields reach a point
1632140	1634140	that they're so self-sustaining
1634140	1637260	that nobody in that field feels the need
1637260	1638100	to talk outside of the field.
1638100	1640220	I'm happy not to say string theory once
1640220	1641060	for the rest of this.
1641060	1643980	I wanna talk about quantum gravity as the problem,
1643980	1645620	which subsumes string theory,
1645620	1647460	and it doesn't point the finger at string theory
1647460	1648300	in particular.
1648300	1649620	But I would say, like again,
1649620	1652900	and I would say it's true even in areas
1652900	1654180	that are experimentally driven.
1654180	1657380	Like this phenomena of a field becoming big enough
1657380	1661260	that it does not have to refer to nature
1661260	1663100	or progress or anything.
1663100	1665760	And it's just, as long as we're making everyone
1665760	1666760	in our community happy
1666760	1668640	and we're all speaking the same language,
1668640	1669620	then we're all doing fine.
1669620	1671700	Are you a miserating other community?
1671700	1672900	Am I?
1672900	1675620	No, no, in these large programs,
1675620	1677940	I'm even somewhat understanding
1677940	1681420	if you guys wanna take some portion of the resources
1681420	1684140	and go off into a cloistered monastery
1684140	1686180	and talk to each other for 40 years,
1686180	1688340	as long as it's not too much, that's fine.
1688340	1690080	It's when you start telling other people
1690080	1691900	that they're stupid,
1691900	1692940	and when you just to say that,
1692940	1694780	I don't know why anyone else works on anything else,
1694780	1695820	that's dumb.
1695820	1697940	And then you start talking about the fact
1697940	1702940	that you play up all of your competitor fields' problems.
1703420	1706220	You don't own your own.
1706220	1709740	What you're talking about is sort of a scientific pathology
1709740	1711380	and our discomfort,
1711380	1714220	our discomfort in dealing with this phenomenon
1714220	1716980	causes us to do proxy arguments.
1716980	1718940	One proxy argument is quantum gravity.
1718940	1720900	The problem with it is it doesn't make contact
1720900	1722260	with experiment.
1722260	1723580	Come on, right?
1723580	1724900	Or it doesn't fit the scientific method.
1724900	1726660	Oh, you're gonna repeat the big bang
1726660	1729940	and just say you have large and give me a break, right?
1729940	1730980	Another one is beauty.
1730980	1733780	Sabina is very focused on beauty.
1733780	1737060	Well, she's doing that in a way to avoid
1737060	1740460	the head-on collision with what she's really trying to say.
1740460	1742820	I'm not trying to avoid the head-on collision.
1742820	1745860	What I'm trying to say is we cannot afford
1745860	1749540	for an imperial culture to be telling other cultures
1749540	1752020	that are trying to work on the same problems
1752020	1755380	that they cannot exist because you've got everything wrapped
1755380	1758780	up and literally we have a situation
1758820	1763740	in which your colleague, David E. Kaplan,
1763740	1766140	was recently featured in an interview
1766140	1767980	where he just let loose.
1767980	1770940	And I know David who did the film Particle Fever.
1770940	1772980	And what he was talking about was the feeling
1772980	1775700	that he was dumb and stupid and couldn't get something.
1775700	1778940	We used to have a game called Tag War in my neighborhood.
1778940	1782460	A new kid would come and we'd say, let's play Tag War.
1782460	1784820	And they would try to figure out the rules of Tag War.
1784820	1787300	More or less it was hazing and abuse.
1787300	1789260	And after about two and a half, three weeks
1789260	1791100	where we changed the rules over and over again
1791100	1793980	so that it find the person, I don't understand the rules.
1793980	1795100	It feels like there are no rules.
1795100	1796700	That's when they became part of the neighborhood
1796700	1799060	because it stood for the game without any rules.
1799060	1800740	That was what Tag War meant.
1800740	1805260	And my feeling about this is we have a Tag War problem
1805260	1808780	coming out of quantum gravity that is stalling the core field
1808780	1811340	that has to get addressed in the lifetime
1811340	1814580	of the people who are still there who created the problem
1814580	1817300	because good science requires that they go back
1817300	1819700	to their statements where there are a lot of people
1819700	1820780	who are no longer here.
1820780	1823060	People who began their careers in the 1980s.
1823060	1826500	How old were you during the anomaly cancellation, 1984?
1826500	1827340	Two years old.
1827340	1828580	There you go.
1828580	1830660	You have no idea what it was like.
1830660	1833660	And you can read about it, but the fact of the matter is
1833660	1836500	it was an absolutely brutal thing.
1836500	1838780	And Brian Greene and I had been having a back and forth
1838780	1839620	about this.
1839620	1841740	He got asked on Kurt Geimungal's program
1841740	1844180	about what are these issues that people keep talking about?
1844180	1846460	And he said, oh, well, we were very enthusiastic.
1846460	1848900	And I heard you say this thing about particle theorists
1848900	1850140	are like bosons.
1850140	1853060	They all line up and sort of find the same things interesting.
1853060	1853820	No.
1853820	1856980	North Koreans line up and find the same things interesting.
1856980	1860580	Iraqis under Saddam Hussein all voted the same way.
1860580	1863540	You have a problem which is why they're behaving like bosons
1863540	1864660	rather than fermions.
1864660	1867860	And why the fermions are being, evolutionary theory
1867860	1870500	has a concept called interference competition,
1870500	1873780	where if you have one animal that tries to keep another animal
1873780	1876340	from being able to get to the salt lick or the water
1876340	1879220	or the food, and then other animal that's being kept from that
1879220	1880100	dies off.
1880100	1882380	And that's how we've lost these people.
1882380	1884780	There are so many theories and interesting people
1884780	1888020	who are no longer with us because of this mad grab
1888020	1891020	for resources quoting something like white man's burden.
1891020	1892820	Manifest destinies.
1892820	1896380	It is our manifest destiny to change the problem.
1896380	1898700	We used to have a concept called unified field theory
1898700	1900060	or unification.
1900060	1900740	That went away.
1900780	1903780	And it got supplanted by something called quantum gravity.
1903780	1905540	And that became the thing that got rolled out
1905540	1907620	through Dennis Overby in the New York Times, repeated
1907620	1911340	in Science Magazine ad nauseam, until everyone
1911340	1914740	was brainwashed thinking, the problem of our time
1914740	1916220	is quantum gravity.
1916220	1919140	And it's not.
1919140	1921820	I mean, are you saying we need literal tribunals
1921820	1924500	to get Edward Whitton and Pulchinsk?
1924500	1925900	Well, we can't get Pulchinsk anymore.
1925900	1928060	But what is it?
1928060	1929100	What's really bothering you?
1929140	1932260	I understand that these are challenges.
1932260	1933980	It's frustrating to have a field that's
1933980	1937420	had, from one perspective, a lack of progress,
1937420	1939380	but entrenched because of the prestige
1939380	1940940	of the previous practitioners.
1940940	1942860	But again, I'd like to point this out.
1942860	1945100	In 1859, there was a very bright guy
1945100	1947780	by the name of James Clerk Maxwell, who worked very hard
1947780	1950340	and had a successful model of electromagnetic wave
1950340	1952900	propagation that, in the sense that it predicted
1952900	1954220	experimental observables.
1954220	1956580	But it was based on whirlpools and eddies
1956980	1959180	and all sorts of other things to substantiate
1959180	1961260	an ether-like material.
1961260	1963460	So he was right for the wrong reasons
1963460	1965460	or wrong for the right reason, Galileo, same thing.
1965460	1968020	He thought the tides were caused by the Earth's rotation.
1968020	1969220	They're really caused by the moon.
1969220	1972380	So in other words, why is it so important that we punish
1972380	1972860	Edward Whitton?
1972860	1973740	I mean, I would like to be.
1973740	1974700	It's not a question of punishment.
1974700	1976300	Maybe Edward Whitton has something
1976300	1978220	to say about this behavior.
1978220	1981180	And I would love to hear, Cumran and Brian Green
1981180	1988020	and Lenny Susskin, as well as Natty Cyberg and Eva Silverstein.
1988020	1992420	It would be great to have these people in a dialogue.
1992420	1993740	Natty Cyberg said something.
1993740	1995860	He said, string theorists are very arrogant.
1995860	1997340	If somebody comes up with something
1997340	1998980	that makes progress that isn't string theory,
1998980	2001140	we'll just say it's string theory.
2001140	2005220	And I'm like, no.
2005220	2007540	There's a concept called mustn't.
2007540	2009580	You don't get to do that stuff.
2009660	2012420	You're in the wrong field, if that's how you feel.
2012420	2014860	And I know, Natty, we have a cordial relationship.
2017980	2019980	You don't get to play that way.
2019980	2021900	You don't get to call people stupid unless you're
2021900	2025140	going to back it up, or it can come back at you.
2025140	2027780	I mean, I would be happy to talk to Lenny Susskin
2027780	2029420	and talk to him about all the people he's
2029420	2032100	insulted over the years, because he's so very open about it.
2032100	2033580	He's not hiding it.
2033580	2035340	Just say, you're an old man.
2035340	2036780	You're at the end of your career.
2036780	2038340	How to go?
2038380	2040500	What happened?
2040500	2042860	Did you make the progress that your friend Feynman made,
2042860	2044420	or Murray Gelman, or any of the people
2044420	2046180	that you knew from a previous era?
2046180	2047940	Am I feeling about this?
2047940	2048420	Pardon me?
2048420	2049820	That's a very high standard.
2049820	2053300	Let's talk about the A team, the Institute for Advanced Study.
2053300	2056260	At some point recently, had Robert Dycraft, a string
2056260	2060620	theorist as its director, Natty Cyberg, a string theorist,
2060620	2064380	Edward Whitten, Juan Maldesena, and then
2064380	2068420	Nima was sort of off a little bit in necessarily
2068420	2069860	quantum gravity.
2069860	2075780	That's an enormous investment in quantum gravity.
2075780	2077900	And the problem that I'm having with this
2077900	2083020	is Dan Friedan, a prominent quantum gravity researcher,
2083020	2085540	talked about this openly, said science only
2085540	2088660	works when we actually go back and look
2088660	2092740	at how we've behaved and confront our own failures.
2092780	2094980	This is the same thing with the bootstrap method.
2094980	2096500	I feel like what we're doing is we're
2096500	2098740	living the Jeffrey Chu nightmare all over again.
2098740	2100340	Do you feel like that's the challenge
2100340	2101780	that we're facing in the theoretical?
2101780	2104820	Well, I'd first like to just, I think
2104820	2107660	we can agree that there can be sociology problems.
2107660	2110740	But I would also say, as a young person,
2110740	2114500	I find the same level of saying that there's
2114500	2116620	been no progress in physics.
2116620	2119980	It's insulting to young people who are not part of this,
2119980	2121820	who feel like we're making real progress,
2121860	2125060	who see real progress happening, and to say,
2125060	2127420	but at the same time, if you're going back
2127420	2131460	to a much older generation, and you're saying,
2131460	2133260	and we're painting everyone who's come back
2133260	2136540	in the past 40 years as being complicit with this,
2136540	2138180	and we can't think for ourselves,
2138180	2139540	and we're being influenced by it,
2139540	2142380	and it doesn't make it easier for us to go off,
2142380	2145100	to just say we've made no progress.
2145100	2147100	Doesn't help it easier.
2147100	2149220	But that's a total mischaracter.
2149220	2151520	I mean, I've never said anything so simplistic
2151520	2152600	in my life.
2152600	2154880	What I've said is, when you try to say
2154880	2156880	that you're going to quantize gravity,
2156880	2159600	what you're talking about is quantizing geometry.
2159600	2162920	And what happened was the most romantic backfire possible
2162920	2165840	in the sciences is that you instead geometrized
2165840	2168880	the quantum, and the great legacy of these people
2168880	2171040	is that they figured out that quantum field theory
2171040	2173600	really has nothing to do with physics.
2173600	2176280	Physics, as we understand it, the physical world
2176280	2179080	is one input to the quantum field theory machine.
2179080	2182000	Quantum field theory is really about waves on waves.
2182000	2183760	And that happens in cowardism theorem
2183760	2185160	and algebraic topology.
2186040	2188440	It happens in conformal theory that has nothing to do
2188440	2192280	with the physical dimensions and realms.
2192280	2194480	What we found out was fascinating
2194480	2196120	because in fact, it backfired.
2196120	2198200	And there's nobody who would like to celebrate
2198200	2203200	all the good that Digraph and Natty and Ed and Company did
2204360	2207640	in this story, including the celebration of the toy models.
2207640	2212480	The problem that I'm having is that they reordered the field.
2212480	2216880	I mean, this is a book that I keep very close to me
2217760	2220080	because it's a conference that happened
2220080	2224320	at the exact moment before the anomaly cancellation.
2224320	2227880	And Murray Gelman gave a keynote address
2227880	2230800	at Shelter Island 2, the conference that was supposed
2230800	2232920	to recapitulate the 1947 conference
2232920	2234840	that got physics back on track.
2234840	2237480	So they're trying to get back the magic.
2237480	2239760	He says, as usual, solving the problems of one era
2239760	2242160	has shown up the critical questions of the next.
2242160	2243640	The very first ones that come to mind
2243640	2245080	looking at the standard theory of today.
2245080	2247080	He's talking about the standard model.
2248480	2250440	Why this particular structure for the families
2250440	2251840	and particular why flavor chiral
2251840	2253080	with left and right-handed particles
2253080	2254000	being treated differently?
2254000	2254960	Why three families?
2254960	2258080	That's a generalization of Robbie's famous question.
2258080	2261840	How many sets of Higgs bosons are there in the standard theory?
2261840	2264360	And why SU3 cross SU2 cross U1?
2264360	2265720	Why those symmetries?
2265720	2270480	Now, in all of those cases, those are classical questions.
2270480	2272560	And what you see and the reason that it's important
2272560	2274840	that your generation know its history
2274840	2278560	is that one of the things that happens in marketing
2278560	2282600	is that you have a product and you have to create a problem
2282600	2285680	so that your product fills that hole, right?
2285680	2288040	And this is what happens with the 76 trombones
2288040	2289560	in the Music Man, right?
2289560	2293840	You've got a problem in its pool and the solution is music.
2293840	2298440	And okay, what these people did to the field
2298440	2300360	was that they reordered our concept
2300360	2302760	of what our principal problems were
2302760	2304400	around the problems that they thought
2304400	2306800	they were most likely to solve.
2306800	2310320	And I don't need them to be in pain.
2310320	2313360	I don't want to see particularly vindictive.
2313360	2316000	But what I do want to see is tell me about all the people
2316000	2318640	whose careers were terminated during this.
2318640	2320560	Tell me what they were working on.
2320560	2321600	Should we have them back?
2321600	2323800	Should we have conferences devoted
2323800	2327440	to what if quantum gravity doesn't exist?
2327440	2328640	Shall we actually ask,
2328640	2330880	because what you talked about with heterodoxy
2330880	2335200	is that you're usually talking about orthodoxy plus epsilon.
2335200	2337600	I'm gonna go out in the limb and say sterile neutrino.
2337600	2339800	Well, that's not really very heterodox.
2339800	2340960	And then maybe you go a little bit,
2340960	2342640	I'm gonna say that there are multiple axions
2342640	2344240	to solve the strong CP problem
2344240	2346800	plus create cosmic birefring.
2346800	2348480	Whatever these things are,
2349480	2353080	they're not really what we're talking about
2353080	2354560	in terms of heterodoxy.
2354560	2359400	And it's very important to either impose these rules
2359400	2360720	on this group of people
2360720	2362440	or to relax the rules for other people
2362440	2364840	so that we can have truly different ideas
2364840	2367280	because I think that we will probably find
2367280	2368680	that over the last 50 years,
2368680	2371760	there were many ideas that will fall into the final theory
2371760	2375120	that were pushed aside into the dustbin by this group.
2375120	2376720	I mean, again, I wanna take it back
2377320	2380080	what I think is certainly not to invalidate
2380080	2381080	anything you've said, Eric,
2381080	2384800	but I think that that might be parochial to the extent
2384800	2387560	that it may involve certain members of the community
2387560	2390360	who aren't affiliated with these three-letter organizations
2390360	2394960	like IAS or MIT or whatever, NSA.
2394960	2396880	But I think what's more interesting,
2396880	2399200	and Dan is free to apply in any way he likes
2399200	2400120	and respond to you,
2400120	2403360	but the point I think is how many flowers
2403360	2404560	should be blooming right now?
2404600	2407440	I mean, you mentioned a couple of different alternatives,
2407440	2410160	a loop on gravity and other things.
2410160	2413120	At what point would you have to say
2413120	2415800	the portfolio should be fully diversified
2415800	2417480	and that we should actually devote
2417480	2419600	equal amounts of attention?
2419600	2420600	Oh, nobody's saying that, Brian.
2420600	2422160	Right, but now you're saying,
2422160	2424720	well, we should hold these people to account.
2424720	2427240	Well, first of all, correct me if I'm wrong,
2427240	2429000	but I don't think Edward Whitton's published something
2429000	2430520	on string theory in a decade.
2430520	2432040	I mean, the last thing I saw is that he wants us
2432040	2433320	to go visit a black hole
2433360	2435120	to see if there's a one microsecond time delay
2435120	2438440	at the end edge of 5AU or something like that.
2438440	2441200	I don't know to what extent he's still holding sway
2441200	2442960	over the field that you're in.
2442960	2444680	Eva is actually much, much younger.
2444680	2445720	What did Coomron say?
2445720	2447080	What did Coomron say?
2447080	2449040	He was on the podcast two years ago
2449040	2451200	and I confronted him as all podcasts are legal,
2451200	2453400	podcasters are legally obligated to do.
2453400	2454960	And I said, what about this claim
2454960	2458880	that there's been no experimentally falsifiable things
2458880	2460800	predicted by string theory?
2460800	2461880	He said, oh, no, no, you're wrong.
2461880	2463840	And you couldn't go back and see this episode.
2463840	2466400	But didn't you ask about what he wanted on his tombstone?
2466400	2467840	Oh, what he wanted on his tombstone?
2467840	2472080	Yeah, that and Michio Kaku, very similar answers.
2472080	2473560	The equations of string theory, right?
2473560	2477160	So, but let me just, one thing that he did say is,
2477160	2478080	well, no, it's not true.
2478080	2480200	String theory does predict the mass of the electron
2480200	2483640	shall be between 10 to the minus 35 plank masses
2483640	2485660	and 10 to the minus one plank masses.
2485660	2486760	And yeah, that sounds all funny.
2486760	2487880	We can laugh about it.
2487880	2492200	You know, in logarithmic space, it's not terrible.
2492200	2494520	I guess the point being, to what extent
2494520	2496000	we're something like loop quantum gravity,
2496000	2498600	which many people, including my friend Carla Revelli
2498600	2500680	has been on the podcast many times,
2500680	2502280	he has said that, yeah, there are challenges.
2502280	2504280	There are experimental falsifications
2504280	2506640	of some of the claims of loop quantum gravity,
2506640	2509560	in particular for propagation of velocity
2509560	2512600	versus electromagnetic frequency of distant quasars.
2512600	2514680	But the point I guess I'm trying to make is,
2514680	2518000	if you are the director of the IAS, you clean house,
2519280	2522000	is it really, I mean, would string theory have,
2522000	2523400	just yes or no, simply yes or no,
2523400	2524640	would string theory have a place
2524640	2526160	and then would loop quantum gravity have a place
2526160	2529040	and then would geometric unity have the primary position?
2529040	2531360	I don't think we need to worry about permanent positions.
2531360	2532840	I think that the key issue, I mean,
2532840	2535040	let me just say some things people won't associate with me.
2535040	2537680	In general, string theorist,
2539640	2541680	part of the quantum graph, I have to use string theory there
2541680	2546680	because they're smarter and that's uncomfortable.
2548080	2549880	But they're really, really smart
2549880	2552480	and they're really, really good at quantum field theory.
2552480	2555800	And I see that and I'm happy about that.
2555800	2559520	What's more, many of them are really good at geometry.
2559520	2561680	And it's incredibly impressive.
2561680	2564560	And I think that it does wonderful things for the field
2564560	2567960	to have progress going on in the gym on the treadmill
2567960	2570000	when you're not actually running a marathon.
2570000	2573960	So in a certain sense, in that particular sub-community,
2573960	2575280	people are in extremely good shape.
2575280	2577920	The generals have been playing war games for 50 years
2577920	2579960	because there were no war games to fight.
2579960	2582040	They have a distorted sense of what being a general
2582040	2584560	actually is because they haven't seen action.
2584560	2589560	But I would never want these people driven out of the field.
2589920	2592920	I don't know anyone I praise as much as Edward Whitten
2592920	2595760	for his contributions principally to geometry
2595760	2597640	and to the structure of quantum field theory,
2597680	2598880	although not the quantum field theory
2598880	2600480	that we seem to live with it.
2600480	2603320	So I don't think that that's really the argument
2603320	2604160	that I'm making.
2604160	2605720	And I think that part of the problem is that
2605720	2608120	this is a very clickbait thing about, you know,
2608120	2610680	string theory is BS versus no string theory,
2610680	2612680	the power and the glory of string theory.
2612680	2614880	It's of no interest to anyone.
2614880	2616600	What you said about loop quantum gravity
2616600	2617440	that was interesting.
2617440	2619720	I asked Lee Smolen about this, who's a friend.
2619720	2621880	He says, yeah, the original hope
2621880	2623720	for loop quantum gravity is not realized
2623720	2625920	without other ideas, this does not work.
2625920	2626760	It doesn't carry the day
2626760	2629000	and it doesn't behave as expected.
2629000	2631480	Now say what you want about Lee Smolen,
2631480	2633840	and I'll be honest, a lot of people
2633840	2635920	in that other community in quantum gravity
2635920	2639240	say incredibly negative things about Lee Smolen,
2639240	2641680	but he behaved properly.
2641680	2643400	There's no need for a tribunal
2643400	2646600	when a leader of the field says, you know what?
2646600	2650480	We were exuberant and they were exuberant.
2650480	2652480	We were optimistic, they were optimistic,
2652480	2656160	but they didn't go about with this manifest destiny nonsense
2656160	2658800	and they can reflect and say, you know what?
2658800	2660680	It doesn't work the way we thought
2660680	2663360	or we can't get fermions into the theory comfortably
2663360	2664560	or something like that.
2664560	2667640	And I really think that we have to understand the difference
2667640	2669400	that the ethics of loop quantum gravity
2669400	2673720	are much better than the ethics in its competitor.
2673720	2678760	Well, I think where I push back is just,
2678760	2681040	I think you're often identifying
2681040	2682480	understanding quantum field theory
2682480	2685280	with doing quantum gravity research.
2686240	2689080	For me, I would say the young people,
2689080	2691840	so you want the older veterans of the field
2691840	2694000	to say they were wrong, and that may never happen.
2694000	2694840	No, no, no, no, maybe they're not wrong.
2694840	2695680	I think if you talk-
2695680	2697000	I want them to face the issue.
2697000	2698760	But I think if you talk to the,
2698760	2700920	I think the response you're talking about,
2700920	2703240	which is like, do people see the challenges?
2703240	2706320	I think what a lot of younger people would say
2706320	2708640	the lessons that have been learned from string theory
2708640	2711760	is that we didn't understand quantum field theory well enough
2711760	2713120	to be ready to jump.
2713120	2715800	We've learned so many lessons about just quantum field theory
2715800	2717920	that we were kind of out over our skis thinking,
2717920	2720160	oh, we've got this quantum field theory thing solved.
2720160	2722040	We should be jumping to quantum gravity.
2722040	2724200	And we've learned so much about quantum field theory.
2724200	2727520	And quantum field theory is certainly relevant to,
2728800	2731280	data and real life and cosmology.
2731280	2733000	And as a matter of it, it covers everything.
2733000	2736200	It's the, to steal a headline from an article
2736200	2739520	on the CERN Courier, it's like the theory of theories, right?
2739520	2742520	It organizes not just like one theory,
2742520	2745360	but sort of how all theories fit together.
2745360	2746600	So what is the theory of theory?
2746600	2748840	So this was used as a title to an article
2748840	2750640	about effective field theory.
2750640	2753080	But it was just understood that a lot of what we've been
2753080	2756320	learning is, what is the space of theories
2756320	2757360	that are self consistent?
2757360	2759120	Like what are the rules?
2759120	2761360	And part of the, why was,
2761360	2763320	like one of the things we got out of string theory,
2763320	2766960	what like the string community was ADFCFT.
2766960	2768560	And what that told us is a lot of things
2768560	2770040	that we had been thinking were,
2770040	2771560	people had been thinking were problems
2771600	2773120	that were going to be solved by the string
2773120	2775520	were really phenomena that was living
2775520	2777160	in an everyday quantum field theory
2777160	2779080	that we hadn't fully understood.
2779080	2781440	And I would say my generation probably more,
2781440	2784040	like a lot of people who I think you might look at
2784040	2785680	and say, you know, based on their training,
2785680	2787440	like who their PhD advisors were,
2787440	2789520	you might say, well, that's a string theorist.
2789520	2791360	And I would say, I don't think they ever do string theory.
2791360	2793200	Like they do quantum field theory
2793200	2794520	and they know quantum field theory is relevant.
2794520	2795360	They've moved to that.
2795360	2796920	But I think some never did it.
2796920	2798960	Like literally at no point in their graduate career
2798960	2801240	at any point they have a, like so myself,
2801240	2802840	I did string theory when I was younger.
2802840	2804720	I would not characterize myself as a string theorist
2804720	2807520	or someone who ever uses string theory.
2807520	2810120	Nobody told me I had to do string theory.
2810120	2811720	You have characterized yourself as somebody
2811720	2813280	who finds it useful in what you do.
2813280	2815040	And so you are using string theory.
2815040	2820040	Because I learned, because the phrase what was useful
2820920	2823960	is that string theory was always characterized as,
2823960	2825000	you know, what is it?
2825000	2826960	What's the problem of quantum gravity we're trying to solve?
2826960	2829320	We're trying to solve problems about the fact
2829400	2831480	that the thing doesn't make sense at short distances.
2831480	2833120	And of course, all these things are supposed to make sense
2833120	2833960	at long distances
2833960	2835720	because they're good effective field theories.
2835720	2837240	We don't like, unless we're doing
2837240	2838880	all four short distance physics,
2838880	2841800	it has, you know, everything should just make sense
2841800	2843040	in some reasonable way.
2843040	2845480	And, but I learned what I was learning
2845480	2846320	about loop quantum gravity.
2846320	2847640	That's nowhere in sight, right?
2847640	2851160	Because there's so many lessons I didn't learn
2851160	2853000	that were just basic lessons about, you know,
2853000	2855160	how should theories be organized
2855160	2857800	that were never in the loop quantum gravity playbook,
2857800	2859040	at least when I was learning it.
2859240	2861880	And so, yeah, what I learned doing string theory was like,
2861880	2863320	I really learned effective field theory.
2863320	2865280	I learned, when is there a problem
2865280	2867880	that I actually have to worry about string theory too?
2867880	2871560	And what I mostly learned is that this is very small.
2871560	2872400	No, of course.
2872400	2873800	And you can do a lot of really, really exciting
2873800	2876400	and cool stuff that's, I would call fundamental
2876400	2877560	without ever talking about quantum gravity.
2877560	2878880	I've looked at your career
2878880	2880840	and to the best of my understanding,
2880840	2883840	your career is at the school with three basic legs.
2883840	2886000	One of which is cosmology,
2886000	2888440	where you're gonna get data from all the great new instruments
2888480	2890520	that we're putting towards the heavens.
2891520	2893400	Second thing is effective theory,
2893400	2896320	so that you're going to reduce everything to something
2896320	2898920	which, you know, at some particular scale
2898920	2901680	is very cleanly defined and you can work with it.
2903280	2906840	And then the other thing is some amount of particle theory
2906840	2909400	where you're gonna hope to use the cosmological
2909400	2911920	through the effective theory to elucidate the nature
2911920	2914800	of the fundamental fields as waves and collision.
2914800	2918240	So that's, I see your particular gambit.
2918240	2920880	And I'm 100% supportive of it.
2920880	2922760	You did refer to yourself as a young person.
2922760	2924360	You're over 40 if I'm not mistaken.
2924360	2925200	Unfortunately, yes.
2925200	2927320	Okay, so you're not a young person.
2927320	2928720	I think I just crossed the threshold
2928720	2930200	by academic standards.
2930200	2931200	No, no, no, but you know,
2931200	2933280	Derock's old thing about a physicist
2933280	2937640	the past 30th year, this is elongated in part
2937640	2940360	because of the fact that we deviated
2940360	2941680	from scientific norms.
2941680	2945120	We don't have 25 year olds and 30 year olds
2945120	2947920	who are running the field the way I think of as normal.
2947920	2950200	I think there are way too many people in the field
2950200	2952040	to be honest when you're asking what would you do?
2952040	2953800	And I feel that of those people,
2953800	2958320	they're not properly arrayed across first.
2958320	2960320	Well, they're not fermionic.
2960320	2962480	There are plenty of people who like
2962480	2966880	Brian Greenfield's no need to query Peter Wojt
2966880	2968520	who's putting forward a twister theory
2968520	2972400	based on the group SU4 and its inclusion of SU3 cross U1
2973400	2976520	as a subgroup in twister space
2976560	2979720	with a WIC continuation to SU2 cross SU2
2979720	2981600	where one of the two halves gives the weak force
2981600	2984480	and therefore it gives you an idea of the asymmetry.
2984480	2987520	You have to read your colleague's stuff
2987520	2991200	whether you like it or not to be a good colleague.
2991200	2993000	You don't have to read all of it,
2993000	2996280	but when you can't put in 45 minutes
2996280	2997960	and there was a piece of French
2997960	3000560	that was between 45 and minutes, I didn't say on air
3001600	3003040	and you say, I'm too busy
3003040	3005160	and then we catch you playing ping pong in the lounge
3005200	3006960	or you're going to drinking
3006960	3009920	or you're writing a blog about nothing in particular,
3009920	3011920	it's completely disingenuous.
3011920	3014960	Now, another example of this is Garrett Leasey.
3014960	3017920	Garrett Leasey is a snickering.
3017920	3019720	Garrett Leasey, you mean that thing
3019720	3020960	that dislodged this man?
3020960	3022400	Okay.
3022400	3024080	No, it doesn't work.
3024080	3025480	I don't think it works.
3025480	3028560	It's got tons of interesting good ideas in it.
3028560	3033560	And this condescension against individual research programs
3034160	3036120	where somebody has a really interesting idea
3036120	3039720	and I think both Peter White and Garrett are wrong
3039720	3041360	and it's not going to work,
3041360	3043800	but I'll be goddamn if I'm going to stand back and say,
3043800	3045960	because I think I can see why it's not going to work,
3045960	3048200	I'm going to pretend that you have no ideas
3048200	3051480	and I'm going to slag you behind your back as a colleague
3051480	3055240	and I'm going to dunk and drag on Twitter.
3055240	3057200	This is toxic behavior.
3057200	3058400	And so what I think is,
3058400	3061840	is that we have very few idiosyncratic programs
3061840	3063720	that are able to even share a stage.
3063720	3067160	There's no point of contact where,
3069680	3071840	I have an unusual bookmark in this book.
3072960	3074080	It's a dollar.
3074080	3075960	Yeah, it's a dollar.
3075960	3078720	This is a dollar signed by Sheldon Glashow
3078720	3083560	where I won it in a 20 minute discussion in his office
3083560	3086520	and it took him 27 years to,
3087360	3091520	27, I'm going to turn into an NFT and make bajillions.
3092680	3094960	It took him 27 years to acknowledge
3094960	3099520	that he'd lost the bet on whether G2 contained SU3.
3099520	3102120	I have no idea why that took 27 years.
3102120	3104720	I like Shelley, we have a good relationship,
3104720	3108240	but the fact is you can't have people saying,
3108240	3110120	oh, I'm late to pick up my kids,
3110120	3113080	that I have to go out to dinner or whatever
3113080	3115640	and never actually make eye contact
3115680	3118320	with the fact that they're not giving real answers.
3118320	3121520	And by the way, I would love to actually talk physics
3121520	3123360	rather than about physics,
3123360	3126000	but what I'm trying to say is that our meta problem
3126000	3128040	is that with all the money floating around,
3128040	3129960	nobody holds a conference saying,
3130960	3133080	the last 40 years, WTF,
3133920	3135440	with a bunch of different theories,
3135440	3137960	like does anybody else have an idea?
3137960	3139840	And I can assure you, I can go
3141520	3144520	on very large platforms and talk about very concrete ideas.
3144520	3146160	I can try to tell you why I believe
3146160	3147720	that there are three generations of matter,
3147720	3150400	why it's chiral, et cetera, et cetera.
3150400	3153680	And I promise you that the very weird behavior
3153680	3156160	is that people don't take it seriously
3156160	3157640	because what they're really trying to do
3157640	3159200	is not ask questions.
3159200	3160280	They're really trying to say,
3160280	3161960	how do I make this problem go away
3161960	3164400	so I can get back to the cargo cult science
3164400	3167160	that I've made a career around inside of a large community?
3167160	3168520	That's what's dangerous.
3168520	3170360	See, I don't agree with that.
3170360	3172800	I mean, I would say that a lot of people
3172800	3174280	aren't gonna engage with,
3174280	3177480	I mean, the idea that what we need to do
3177480	3179480	is find the right way to unify the forces,
3179480	3182920	I think is just, as you said, it's been unproductive.
3182920	3186200	And a lot of people don't mind that that's how they're,
3186200	3189320	like, you know, there are weird hints from nature, right?
3189320	3191880	Like cosmological constant is a weird hint from nature.
3191880	3193720	And like, we'd like to, we'd like that.
3193720	3195720	Is it unification or that unification wouldn't work?
3195720	3198160	But Daniel, if I ask you,
3198160	3200240	what is your best guess as to why there appear
3200240	3202200	to be three generations of matter?
3202200	3204160	Would you say you have a guess?
3204160	3207000	No, I wouldn't, I mean, I would say there are many people
3207000	3209320	who have worked hard on coming up with models.
3209320	3211640	I'll see, many seem plausible.
3211640	3216120	Like, it could be, like, I have no particular opinion.
3216120	3218760	And I don't think that we're gonna find the answer.
3218760	3220440	So if somebody came up to me
3220440	3223880	who could pass sort of a basic competency test
3223880	3225040	and said, I think I know why
3225040	3227220	there are three generations of matter.
3227220	3228480	I would find that fascinating.
3228480	3230320	Brian and I were on the phone,
3230320	3232360	we were talking about this issue.
3232360	3234120	And Brian said, well, what if I were to tell you
3234120	3237200	of something so exciting that it has seven sigma this,
3237200	3240920	that which is to me, would you race down to San Diego?
3240920	3241760	I said, sure.
3244280	3247600	And I think he wasn't prepared for that answer.
3247600	3250460	There is something about the excitement
3250460	3253760	of believing things, trying things
3253760	3257640	and caring about what your colleagues believe.
3257640	3260800	Do you have any high conviction beliefs
3260800	3263060	about the extension of the standard model?
3264040	3266480	So I do have my high conviction belief
3266480	3268920	is that anything that extends the standard model
3268920	3273920	will look like something that's effective field theory
3274080	3275080	at low energies.
3275080	3278520	So if I'm going to look for hints, experimental hints
3278520	3281960	that are gonna tell me which way the world actually works,
3281960	3283640	my strategy is gonna be,
3283640	3285680	write down everything I could imagine
3285680	3287240	that would look like a change
3287240	3288720	to the effective theory of the standard model
3288720	3289960	and go look for that.
3289960	3293320	And that is what most experimental programs are looking for.
3293320	3294520	But that avoids the question.
3294520	3298200	Do you personally have any high conviction beliefs
3298200	3299640	and I'll extend it?
3299640	3302400	Do you think we have anything wrong in the standard model,
3302400	3305800	not just in terms of the Lagrangian and its consequences,
3305800	3307860	but in terms of how we talk about it?
3307860	3310000	And do you have any high conviction beliefs
3310000	3313840	for what extends it and what is likely to be true?
3313840	3315540	That are really things like this, I believe,
3315540	3316960	can you say the phrase this, I believe.
3316960	3320180	I believe that the universe is Lorenz invariant
3320180	3321180	at short distances,
3321180	3324500	that whatever unifies the standard model
3324500	3326380	is not breaking Lorenz invariance.
3328380	3329380	That if you observed,
3329380	3331220	if we were to observe something cosmologically
3331220	3333500	or laboratory, that would break your conviction
3333500	3336620	or it would cause you to reveal excitingly new research.
3336620	3338740	You believe in relativity.
3338740	3339580	Yes, absolutely.
3339580	3340980	That is not very bold.
3340980	3343660	Okay, but by the way,
3344180	3346180	most things that are being proposed as extensions
3346180	3348820	to the standard model by definition are,
3348820	3349900	well, they might be wrong.
3349900	3350740	Most of them are wrong.
3350740	3351580	How do you know, Eric?
3351580	3352420	We haven't looked for action.
3352420	3354340	Well, because they can't all be correct.
3354340	3355780	They're not all compatible.
3355780	3356780	Some of them are mutually exclusive.
3356780	3358580	All I'm saying is this is to say
3358580	3361860	that the universe is manifestly Lorenz invariant
3361860	3364660	is an interesting claim that could be falsified.
3364660	3367260	And by falsification, I think that would excite you.
3367260	3368260	That wouldn't depress you.
3368260	3369380	That wouldn't ruin your day.
3369380	3371500	It would totally change how I think about it.
3371500	3373140	I love your puppy point.
3373140	3374180	Puppies are adorable.
3374180	3375540	Ice cream is delicious.
3376380	3377220	I understand.
3377220	3379180	Mom and apple pie are good things.
3379180	3381500	But there are, I mean, I think that's a case
3381500	3384380	where people have legitimately proposed ideas
3384380	3387060	that break learns and they're interesting ideas.
3387060	3391220	So, someone who had an idea that broke this principle
3391220	3393260	that was within the kind of traditional community
3393260	3396420	but really broke away from it was Peter Harava
3396420	3400380	with his non Lorenz invariant solutions to gravity,
3400380	3402060	his proposal.
3402060	3404620	And again, like, it was an interesting idea.
3404620	3405620	I didn't look at that and go,
3405620	3406780	I understood what he's doing.
3406780	3407620	We read those papers.
3407620	3408460	Everyone's like, that's interesting idea.
3408460	3409620	So you read the paper, you like.
3409620	3411460	But I also don't think it's the way the world works.
3411460	3412500	And I also.
3412500	3413660	That's not what I'm talking about.
3413660	3415060	Like if Zhao came out with something,
3415060	3417340	maybe you look at it and then you say,
3417340	3418420	okay, that's pretty wild.
3418420	3420180	I don't buy it, but I understand what he's doing.
3420180	3422500	But I think, again, the difference between Peter
3422500	3424900	who was definitely deviating away from the community
3424900	3426060	was not that they're like,
3426060	3427660	he's a card-carrying member of the community.
3427660	3430340	Is that he was able to communicate his idea
3430340	3432420	in a way that made sense to everyone.
3432420	3435140	And, but that, but I guess what I would say is like,
3435140	3437100	you're asking me to take a definitive position
3437100	3438460	about a theory we could never test.
3438460	3440340	No, no, no, I'm saying you're a theoretical physicist.
3440340	3441180	Yeah, absolutely.
3441180	3442900	You are, you know, and to be fair to you,
3442900	3445380	cause I'm not, there's no gotcha or a zinger here.
3445380	3447860	I see you as mostly a cosmologist
3447860	3450100	who is keeping the door open to particle theory
3450100	3452820	through the conduit of effective theory, right?
3452820	3454140	And that may not be fair
3454140	3455780	because I've only been studying stuff for days.
3455780	3456620	I understand.
3456620	3458420	I guess what I would say is that I,
3458420	3460380	no, effective field theory is life, right?
3460380	3462820	Like it's like, it's how the,
3462820	3465740	it's how everything we organize, it's just,
3465740	3467300	it's all we see, right?
3467300	3469380	I'm living here in this like, there's not like,
3469380	3470620	Newton's laws weren't wrong.
3470620	3472740	They're just an effective theory relevant to our.
3472740	3474260	If we were to talk about biology, right?
3474260	3475740	So we have the stratification.
3475740	3477700	We have cytology, the study of cells below.
3477700	3479380	Then we have histology, the study of tissues.
3479380	3480900	And we have physiology above that.
3480900	3483180	And we have the organization and anatomy.
3483180	3485660	And if you stayed down at the level and saying, you know,
3485660	3489060	it would be absolutely responsible for us to speculate
3489060	3491180	into different regimes because we understand
3491180	3492900	that we don't actually have information.
3492900	3495820	We've learned the lesson of Ken Wilson very well.
3495820	3497220	That would be pretty disappointing.
3497220	3499740	If you think about, for example, Wheel of Fortune,
3499740	3501620	there are these one letter solves
3501620	3504580	where somebody actually guesses the entire puzzle
3504580	3505620	from a single letter.
3505620	3507060	Look up a guy named Rufus, for example.
3507060	3507900	I understand.
3507900	3510580	Now, my claim is, is that the, the,
3510580	3513060	the dark side of the genius of Ken Wilson.
3513060	3515140	And by the way, Ken Wilson is a good example.
3515140	3517660	Like we just lost Jeff Becker, the guitarist.
3517660	3519700	He was every professional electric guitarist,
3519700	3522180	favorite guitarist, but he wasn't everybody's favorite
3522180	3523940	guitarist who didn't play guitar.
3523940	3527180	In a certain sense, Ken Wilson walks on water
3527180	3531140	within the competent community of physics researchers.
3531140	3534420	But there's a dark side also, just the way Jeff Becker
3534420	3537500	maybe put too much emphasis on the whammy bar
3537500	3540300	of pushing everything into this realm
3540300	3542900	where it's denuded of much of its meaning.
3542900	3545700	Like if I were to say to you that the Higgs field
3545700	3547260	shows up in effective theory
3547260	3549860	as a spin zero fundamental scalar,
3549860	3551580	but I don't think that that's its purpose.
3551580	3554540	I think that it actually belongs to the actual,
3554540	3556580	and the way in which it's disguised
3556580	3560700	so that it's spin appears different than its naive spin,
3560700	3563540	which is its function as a, as a part of a connection.
3564940	3568300	That's something in which effective theory
3568300	3570220	is not going to necessarily point to that
3570220	3574060	because effective theory tends to show you this picture
3574060	3576180	that is often denuded of higher level structures
3576180	3578540	because we're not too afraid to guess.
3578540	3581140	No, the idea is just that it,
3582460	3585620	you can have as wild a variation
3585620	3588740	of the difference of the origin of two theories as you like.
3588740	3593020	And if I limit my observations to some energy scale
3593020	3595900	that's set by colliders or whatever I can do,
3595900	3598140	that the only way that I can tell them apart
3598140	3600980	is by the parameters of the long distance.
3600980	3603900	No, now the parameters can be really useful hints.
3603900	3608460	So in the sixties, Weinberg guessed at asymptotic freedom,
3608460	3610540	which was that the idea that they're like,
3610540	3613060	the theory is really made up of quarks
3613060	3615300	and things that look like microscopic particles
3615300	3618100	just bouncing around, even though they live inside a proton.
3618100	3620900	He guessed at this because of the specific relationships
3620900	3624940	between certain of the couplings of nuclear physics
3624940	3626940	because we couldn't go and look inside of the proton
3626940	3628020	at that point in history.
3628020	3631020	So it's absolutely true that through this lens
3631020	3632820	you can discover exactly as you're seeing.
3632820	3635260	You can within this lens say,
3635260	3638260	there's a pattern here and I can use the tools
3638260	3640300	at my disposal to say the only way to get this pattern
3640300	3642780	points at some deeper structure.
3642780	3643980	So that's exactly what we do.
3643980	3646820	So for example, why proton decay experiments
3646820	3648260	were so exciting because even though
3648260	3650020	they're low energy experiment,
3650020	3652100	they would tell us about physics at very high energies
3652100	3655500	because we only know a few ways to create proton decay
3655500	3657300	or this is why people are really excited
3657300	3659620	to do treating masses because do treating masses hint
3659620	3662780	at something going on at extremely high energies
3662780	3665900	that will never ever be able to probe in the lab.
3665900	3668380	But if you don't kind of, on the other hand,
3668380	3670940	like if I write down a theory that only changes
3670940	3673500	the gears of how the universe works
3673500	3675380	on some scale that I can never observe,
3675380	3677900	my only hope is to see it through the pattern.
3677900	3679540	What's going on with this one?
3679540	3681700	You're mislearning the lesson of the baryon,
3681700	3683580	which is that the baryon isn't decoded
3683580	3685620	into the Lagrangian, the quarks are,
3685620	3689780	but that, I don't even know if we're talking about it,
3689780	3694020	say infrared slavery with physics conscience,
3694020	3697940	but the issue is that protons and neutrons
3697940	3699900	are not what is seen in the Lagrangian.
3699900	3701740	You have to actually unpack them,
3702700	3704540	unpack the fundamental constituents
3704540	3706700	to get the observable constituents.
3706700	3708780	Now that lesson when over learned,
3708780	3712060	which is what I'm concerned your community has done,
3712060	3715300	becomes inhibitory and everybody gets innervated
3715300	3716940	because nobody wants to be the fool
3716940	3719100	who didn't learn the lesson of effective theory
3719100	3720180	and renormalization.
3720180	3722100	And that's what's concerning me,
3722100	3724860	is that in general, we have a group of people
3724860	3726980	who are incredibly worried about their union card
3726980	3729500	and being respectable and when they're heterodox,
3729500	3732020	they're heterodox in the most mild and unhelpful way,
3732020	3734500	particularly if you have a metastable state
3734500	3738420	where small perturbations don't work out very well.
3738420	3740100	And so in all of these situations,
3740100	3742300	when I try to engage you in terms of,
3742300	3745140	if you wanna actually talk physics on a podcast,
3745180	3747820	we always talk around physics, we talk about physics,
3747820	3749860	but we don't actually say, well, what do you believe,
3749860	3752700	what do you know, what are the high conviction gets?
3752700	3755020	And I'll say something more.
3755020	3757780	I think you're an extremely good scientist.
3757780	3759500	I've read some of your stuff.
3759500	3764060	I don't aspire to be focused on good scientists
3764060	3766420	because I believe that we have a confusion
3766420	3770140	that great science is just good science turned up to 11.
3770140	3773460	And I think if you, I had this conversation with Jim Watson,
3773460	3775780	his basic point was we were not,
3775780	3778980	Watson Crick were not good scientists in Jim's view.
3778980	3780300	He said, Rosalind Franklin was,
3780300	3782580	and the reason she didn't get the double helix
3782580	3784020	was not because it was stolen,
3784020	3785940	which there are certainly issues,
3785940	3788820	but because she refused to spend a day decamped
3788820	3790820	into the idea that the Maltese cross
3790820	3794220	near X-ray crystallography represented a helix.
3794220	3797740	And so his point was our search space is tiny
3797740	3800540	because we're only looking for helical models
3800540	3803140	and her search space was enormous
3803140	3806420	because she correctly viewed that that particular pattern
3806420	3808340	was not sufficient to narrow it down.
3809340	3812020	But I mean, someone watching is just this passionate
3812020	3814220	but has some knowledge of you and in the field.
3814220	3816940	I mean, you've ruled out, just in words today
3816940	3819340	and not to mention previous discussions we've had,
3820380	3824700	alternative theories to anything but your own
3824700	3826860	personal conviction, which is that she,
3826860	3829180	so you've ruled out E8, you've ruled out Wolfram,
3829180	3831140	you've ruled out loop quantum gravity.
3831140	3832940	Not, I think ruled it out like they shall be taken
3832940	3833780	behind the woodshed.
3833780	3834620	No, bro.
3835460	3836780	Well, so how much time-
3836780	3840380	I think we should be invested in cellular automata.
3840380	3842860	I think we really need to study the large exceptionally groups
3842860	3844740	inside of the TITS-Fordens' Rural Structure.
3844740	3846580	The theories of everything.
3846580	3849420	I think that Peter Wojt's theory to begin with SU3,
3849420	3850940	which is the one part of the symmetries
3850940	3853980	that doesn't have another name because U1 is also spin two,
3853980	3857660	SO2 the circle, same thing with SU2 is the three sphere,
3857660	3860620	spin three, SU3 is unique in that it doesn't have
3860620	3861940	another name.
3861940	3865580	And so he begins with that and he sticks basically U3
3865580	3867540	inside of SU4.
3867540	3869420	And I think it's a great idea.
3869420	3872060	And I don't want to be mischaracterized.
3872060	3875260	I am the only person pushing forward GU.
3876580	3879580	I am also pushing forward when I was asked recently
3879580	3880980	by the Institute for Arts and Ideas.
3880980	3882700	They wanted to say, well, tell us now about GU
3882700	3884180	after you've done all this service to our field.
3884180	3885820	I was like, no, I don't want to do that.
3885820	3888140	I would rather tell you about my competitors
3888180	3890900	in idiosyncratic fermionic space.
3890900	3892580	It's you guys who don't do that.
3892580	3895660	So please don't put on me that I'm simply a proponent
3895660	3897060	that is always pushing my product
3897060	3898860	and selling from the stage, far from it.
3898860	3900220	I don't think it's selling from it,
3900220	3902260	but it's just from a pragmatic standpoint.
3902260	3905100	Daniel's got a limited amount of theoretical bandwidth.
3905100	3907180	My students do as well.
3907180	3908260	It's not that much, Brian.
3908260	3909860	Well, no, I agree with you.
3909860	3912220	I agree with you that to hear Sabine say,
3912220	3914140	well, she doesn't have time to look at your theory
3914140	3916020	and Garrett's theory and Wolfram's theory.
3916020	3917020	She doesn't want to get sucked in.
3917020	3919820	She doesn't want to, but that doesn't prove that it's right.
3919820	3921860	I mean, it's not evidence that they're correct.
3921860	3923500	No, but it leaves the wrong impression.
3923500	3926580	Right, and that's maybe not as collegial as it could be,
3926580	3928620	but there's a limited amount.
3928620	3931020	So the question is for working card carries,
3931020	3932420	you call them union members.
3932420	3935580	I mean, what is it about what you're doing
3935580	3938300	that is most exciting and most interesting to you
3938300	3940740	and the reason that keeps you getting up in the morning
3940740	3942460	and thinking about it in the middle of the night?
3942460	3945860	What questions or what contributions are so interesting
3945860	3948260	and promising along the, obviously promising
3948260	3950420	from the current research direction you're pursuing?
3950420	3953820	Okay, so I mean, what have I spent the past years working on
3953820	3956060	is trying to understand the sitter space.
3956060	3958500	Now, the sitter space seems to be the universe we live in.
3958500	3959620	It's also-
3959620	3960820	What do you mean by that?
3960820	3964020	As in the expansion of the universe right now.
3964020	3964860	It looks-
3964860	3965700	It's approximately-
3965700	3966540	It's approximately a sitter.
3966540	3967900	Okay, but there's a big difference.
3967900	3972340	Okay, yes, but at the level of approximation
3972340	3975060	that the universe we live in seems to be a sitter,
3975060	3978220	we did not understand how to calculate things in the sitter.
3978220	3980220	And there are people who claim that,
3980220	3981860	the sitter was fundamentally unstable
3981860	3984460	because of various things that they couldn't calculate.
3984460	3986420	And this proved that like,
3986420	3989620	it's impossible to have a positive causal constant
3989620	3991540	for this reason or the other.
3991540	3994060	And so what I wanna, like,
3994060	3995980	why do I use effective field theory?
3995980	3999380	Because many of the calculations that people were saying
3999380	4001180	proved that this were like,
4001180	4002700	they were instantly,
4002740	4005020	you could see the mistake in the calculation.
4005020	4006380	So as you say, like,
4006380	4007540	yes, effective field theory,
4007540	4010580	you can have your blinders on to what might be interesting,
4010580	4012820	but more often than not in my career.
4012820	4013660	100%.
4013660	4015300	It's like the way you say,
4015300	4017300	hey, that calculation have a mistake in it.
4017300	4018220	And like,
4018220	4019620	all the every time it's a mistake.
4019620	4021380	It's like getting rid of pseudo tensors.
4021380	4024140	It's a very good place to catch errors.
4024140	4024980	Absolutely.
4024980	4026980	So I don't, I am in no way saying like,
4026980	4029020	it's not interesting to think about things that,
4029020	4031300	yeah, I'd be the first person excited about a thing
4031300	4033580	that doesn't look like it lives in effective field theory.
4033580	4034420	Right?
4034420	4035700	And so that would be awesome.
4035700	4037820	And I have friends who, you know, explore, you know,
4037820	4039260	modifications to quantum mechanics.
4039260	4040100	And maybe that means
4040100	4042700	or things that look like they violate the rules.
4042700	4045100	Those are extremely exciting and interesting things
4045100	4047660	that a lot of the people do seriously consider.
4047660	4049860	But again, if you don't start from,
4049860	4052860	but if I have a theory that fits a set of rule,
4052860	4054580	it has to follow the structure.
4054580	4056380	More often than not, you just do calculations wrong.
4056380	4057220	Right?
4057220	4058060	And it's like, yeah,
4058060	4059500	you spend five years doing calculation
4059500	4061020	or in some cases in this interspace,
4061060	4064980	like it was 30 years where people calculated things
4064980	4067780	over and over again and literally learn nothing.
4067780	4069420	There's tons of calculations
4069420	4071420	and we learned no lessons from it.
4071420	4074020	And the part of the point of effective field theory
4074020	4075740	is that like it just organizes
4075740	4077140	what are interesting calculations,
4077140	4078620	what the answer should look like.
4078620	4080620	And if something violates effective field theory,
4080620	4082100	then at least you can go like,
4082100	4084300	like waiter was the step that violated the rules.
4084300	4086840	And if none of the steps violate the rules,
4086840	4088020	then you've got a problem.
4088020	4089740	And so what I would say for me,
4089740	4091580	like the, what's the ultimate goal
4091580	4093100	of understanding disorder space?
4093100	4095060	Like it is getting back to like,
4095060	4097100	what did the beginning of time look like?
4097100	4098140	What is the space,
4098140	4100460	what are the space of possible universes?
4100460	4102980	And like, is the multiverse a well-defined thing?
4102980	4103860	Does it even make sense?
4103860	4106140	Like these are questions that are enormous.
4106140	4108580	And, but we can't answer like,
4108580	4110180	there are people who want to jump to the like,
4110180	4111900	how do we define internal inflation
4111900	4113820	and make up rules for calculating?
4113820	4115260	And they make up this and they make up that.
4115260	4116660	And they say, well, in my toy model
4116660	4118220	with this rule and that rule, it does this.
4118220	4122020	It's like, we don't know enough to play those games.
4122020	4123700	And I guess that would be my point to you.
4123700	4126340	You're like, in response to your comment
4126340	4130140	about great scientists is that the challenge
4130140	4132580	is ultimately going to be like, you know,
4132580	4135260	there are moments in history that just call
4135260	4137580	for careful analysis of the laws we have.
4137580	4139420	Well, in the normalization a certain sense was that.
4139420	4140260	Absolutely.
4140260	4141860	And the same with like Lagrangian mechanics,
4141860	4142700	Hamiltonian mechanics.
4142700	4145860	Like there's a huge time between Newton
4145860	4147700	and changes the laws and the science
4147700	4148820	that happened there was super important.
4148820	4150580	The question is, what time is it?
4150580	4152460	Is the time for a conservative revolution?
4152460	4154500	Is the time for a wildlife revolution?
4154500	4157740	And I don't think it's responsible for anyone to say,
4157740	4160060	I know what time it is unless they have a very good reason
4160060	4161340	for saying that they know what time it is.
4161340	4163660	So I think that to your earlier point,
4163660	4167340	you want to let some conservative people hug the shore
4167340	4169380	and say, maybe we have a small error.
4170580	4174420	And you may also, I mean, the dressed and bare mass
4174420	4175980	of the electron is a perfect example
4176020	4179060	of what seemed to be a small error that cost two decades.
4179060	4182740	So at a certain level, that's completely legitimate.
4182740	4185220	And what I see you doing with effective field theory
4185220	4188140	is in some sense using it as a substitute for experiment,
4188140	4191300	which is how do we test whether our wild ideas
4191300	4193580	actually make a certain kind of sense?
4193580	4195860	And so I think it's very responsible
4195860	4198980	and part of the good science wrap that I'm sticking you with
4198980	4201300	is that you're trying to do something
4201300	4202820	where you can't repeat the Big Bang.
4202820	4204500	You can't run an experiment in the lab
4204820	4206420	where everything goes right.
4206420	4209140	And effective theory is a great way of sorting
4209140	4211540	some amount of wheat from some amount of chaff
4211540	4214820	provided that you always keep in mind
4214820	4218060	that it also carries certain sorts of distortions
4218060	4220420	that bias us against bold guesses
4220420	4222980	because many of our structures recur
4222980	4227980	at various different strata of the effective stratification.
4228220	4230300	I do not disagree with that at all.
4230300	4232540	And I completely agree that, you know,
4232540	4234500	even in our corner of cosmology,
4234500	4237060	like I would not characterize myself as a stringer,
4237060	4239220	but I have found string theory useful
4239220	4242140	because sometimes even though I have not found anything
4242140	4244260	that cannot be expressed as effective field theory,
4244260	4246540	like it does push us in a weird direction.
4246540	4248380	There's like that idea came out of left field
4248380	4250500	and suitably reinterpreted.
4250500	4251820	It was a really cool thing to look for.
4251820	4254340	This is what Nima said to me about Ravita Schwinger fields
4254340	4256300	in the Bella Swanseger problem, as he said,
4256300	4259180	that it's very tricky to couple Ravita Schwinger
4259180	4262300	to external or to internal degrees of freedom
4262340	4264380	without having superluminal problems.
4264380	4266660	String theory showed us a way to do that.
4266660	4269340	And so whether or not you're a string advocate
4269340	4271140	or not a string advocate,
4271140	4273780	you at least wanna help yourself to the bounty
4273780	4274980	that came from this theory,
4274980	4277460	which is one of the reasons why I'm absolutely not
4277460	4279740	for ending support for string theory.
4279740	4281740	But the part of the problem is that this space
4281740	4283420	is so polluted by stupidity
4283420	4286700	that world's smartest people acting like jackasses
4286700	4291220	is that we're not having this conversation fresh and new.
4291260	4293980	We're having this conversation after not even wrong.
4293980	4296500	After, you know, and part of the problem is,
4296500	4298260	is that the field became not even Pauly.
4298260	4301020	Pauly was a dick and he was famously a dick.
4301020	4302100	He was a witty dick.
4302100	4305100	He was a very high, you know, very high standards.
4305100	4306900	I don't know, you know, Switzerland,
4306900	4308300	they're very precise over there.
4308300	4309620	But the fact of the matter is,
4309620	4312700	is that he's a terrible person for most people to emulate
4312700	4314980	because it's basically put down physics.
4314980	4316980	And so, you know, what I really believe is
4316980	4319260	you're trying to do good science, you're a new generation.
4319260	4321940	I don't want you meshed in some of these battles,
4321940	4324900	but I also don't want you on the field of battle,
4324900	4326460	sort of muddling the stuff and saying,
4326460	4328580	well, there are actually a lot of interesting things.
4328580	4331420	We have certain things that we need to get to
4331420	4334900	in order to make sure that as this generation before me
4334900	4337740	exits the stage, they leave the situation
4337740	4338700	like the cat in the hat.
4338700	4340620	They've made a complete mess of things.
4340620	4342300	And it's important that they straighten things up
4342300	4343820	before mom gets home.
4343820	4346700	Yeah, but I guess I would, I would,
4346700	4347860	I don't disagree.
4347860	4350380	There are a lot of things that need to be cleaned up
4350380	4352820	to make it, you know, but I think that it comes
4352820	4353820	in many forms.
4353820	4358300	And the problem is that the problem is that it's like,
4358300	4360620	you can say, oh, it'd be good if, you know,
4360620	4361580	people came and fix it.
4361580	4365980	It is like a handful of people who whose opinions,
4365980	4368460	like just saying things carry anyway.
4368460	4370740	Most people, it's the accumulation of a life
4370740	4373160	of work in the community that eventually move the field.
4373160	4375900	So like an example is like scattering amplitudes.
4375900	4378540	Like, you know, there's an like incredibly great
4378540	4380820	physicists who spent their entire lives working on it.
4380820	4383980	And the way that they, like their results became part
4383980	4387200	of the rest of the community because of the sheer weight
4387200	4388420	of what they had been doing.
4388420	4391220	It was not because it was like they get a compelling talk
4391220	4393780	or because like people, you know, but it was like really
4393780	4395740	that it was just like, eventually they just solve
4395740	4397460	so many problems that people were like,
4397460	4400040	and look at the great, like this double copy problem
4400040	4401760	is really exciting.
4401760	4402600	Absolutely.
4402600	4403580	And the amplitude, right.
4404420	4406740	But again, what I would say is like,
4406740	4410460	but that's where I see that like, I don't,
4410460	4413060	like your point of view is like the field is gonna change
4413060	4416620	when these people have to exit the stage and like,
4416620	4418780	and I think to be honest, like I think a lot of people
4418780	4420740	younger than already see these problems.
4420740	4423180	And it's just that like, they're like the way,
4423180	4425060	they're not, they don't have Edwitton's name.
4425060	4427660	They don't have one's name, but they see what you're
4427660	4430620	talking about and the way that that's gonna manifest
4430620	4432740	itself is that in 20 years you're gonna look back
4432740	4433900	and say, that's what the field is.
4433900	4438900	Many of these people don't know the hypercharge
4439060	4442540	or the weak ice to spin on the fundamental fields.
4442540	4445780	And I hate to say this this way, but I've dealt
4445780	4448140	with people who are quite a bit younger than I am,
4448140	4450260	who are working in this area of fundamental physics.
4450260	4452460	And I start to talk to them about the field content
4452460	4454100	of the standard model.
4454100	4455620	And it's astounding what they say.
4455620	4457780	They say things like, oh yeah, I remember this
4457780	4459460	in graduate school.
4459460	4461140	What the FD mean?
4461140	4463540	You're talking about the fundamental constituents
4463540	4466220	of nature and you can't remember the charge
4466220	4468660	on the strange cork.
4468660	4471500	You can't remember whether it's, you know, upper deck.
4471500	4475700	There is some problem in which people have actually
4475700	4477980	departed physics.
4477980	4480420	I think, I think, I know exactly what you're saying.
4480420	4483420	And I know there are phenomenal like that.
4483420	4486260	So a version of that, which I think is a fair criticism.
4486260	4489340	I don't know the names, but I've heard the story
4489340	4494140	that someone was up for a PhD at their PhD defense
4494140	4497180	and they were asked, what is the wavelength of visible light?
4497180	4499900	And the person said, one meter.
4499900	4503700	And the examiner said, do I look blurry to you?
4503700	4505620	And like, that's the kind of like, you should have
4505620	4508500	real world intuition about like, in that case,
4508500	4509620	it's very obvious.
4509620	4510900	I mean, I would say like, I can't,
4510900	4512740	I don't memorize the periodic table.
4512740	4514500	I mean, the periodic table is obviously important.
4514500	4518420	No, no, no, it's not the, it's 15 or 16 entries
4518460	4519820	in a column vector.
4520780	4522860	But again, like you're asking like, could I,
4522860	4524580	if you woke me up in the middle of the night,
4524580	4527700	could I reproduce every single term in the standard model?
4527700	4530260	Like, you know, like, I don't know that I could.
4530260	4531900	I could get most, I could get most of it.
4531900	4534820	I could get most of it, but it doesn't matter to me
4534820	4536820	in my, in my particular research.
4536820	4539580	Wait a second, I want to understand.
4539580	4542940	You're not carrying around a copy
4543820	4547780	of the representation theory of SU3 cross SU2 cross U1
4547820	4550580	and 15 or 16 dimensional complex space.
4550580	4554060	I'm carrying in a particle data book.
4554060	4558380	Look, not a spark quiz, there's no spark quiz because.
4558380	4560220	I know exactly where to look it up when I'm writing.
4560220	4562580	I know what most of the terms are,
4562580	4564900	but if you had to get me like, what is the exact?
4566380	4568860	For the same reason that memorizing a poem is important
4568860	4571060	because you can always look it up,
4571060	4573340	but you're not going to be able to have it.
4573340	4576860	If it's not cached close to the prefrontal cortex,
4576860	4579540	you're not going to be able to make use of it in real time.
4579540	4580980	It's essential.
4580980	4582660	And I'm not talking, by the way,
4582660	4585260	about understanding all the hadronic resonances
4585260	4588020	or anything like that.
4588020	4590940	What I'm trying to say is the sense of,
4590940	4593780	oh yeah, that's that stuff I learned in graduate school.
4593780	4594620	Is it?
4594620	4597660	I think to answer for Dan, that he doesn't need it.
4597660	4598900	What Feynman said would apply.
4598900	4600340	I mean, Feynman would disagree with you and say,
4600340	4602380	what I can't derive, I don't understand.
4602380	4604220	He didn't say, what I can't memorize, I don't understand.
4604220	4605060	That's not a question of that.
4605100	4606940	It's a question of, for example,
4606940	4609500	let's forget the exact, you know,
4609500	4611660	weak hypercharges summits.
4611660	4614940	You can write down the pseudocode
4614940	4616660	of the standard model of logic.
4616660	4617820	Absolutely, for sure.
4617820	4619500	So that's, first of all,
4619500	4621140	I'm talking about people who can't do that.
4621140	4622740	Oh, I understand what you mean.
4622740	4624340	And I do agree that there's a problem,
4624340	4628780	but at the same time, like, I think there's the like,
4628780	4629940	should we do the standard,
4629940	4632180	should like, just as an intellectual endeavor,
4632180	4634020	should we remember, should we pass down
4634020	4634900	the things that we've learned,
4634900	4636500	we should definitely make sure
4636500	4637340	the standard model is not put out.
4637340	4640180	I'm saying that the younger people that we're discussing,
4640180	4643300	the consequence of not having this reconciliation,
4643300	4646380	by the way, of understanding what quantum gravity
4646380	4650180	did to this field, is that we have a number of people
4650180	4653300	who are not intact in their research careers,
4653300	4654580	who are not in a position,
4654580	4657460	if the answer came screaming across their field of view,
4657460	4659220	they wouldn't necessarily recognize.
4659220	4661900	But I would say there's similarly a problem,
4661900	4663740	it has nothing to do with quantum gravity,
4663780	4665580	which was that the response to all of this
4665580	4667700	is that particle physics has become de-forced
4667700	4668540	from experiment.
4668540	4670380	And the problem is that particle theorists
4670380	4671620	don't know what it's going to experiment.
4671620	4673420	And that has pushed to the point
4673420	4676340	that most young people that I talk to
4676340	4677780	who are particle phenomenologists,
4677780	4679260	now there are people who previously
4679260	4681740	would have known the standard model had a written down.
4681740	4684540	Their feeling now is that like, for them to get a job,
4684540	4685860	and again, is this actually true
4685860	4687100	or just so what they perceive?
4687100	4688580	It's probably some of both,
4688580	4691060	but they feel they have to have an experiment
4691060	4692380	with their name on it,
4692380	4693380	because otherwise people will say,
4693380	4695020	well, they're not in touch with the real world.
4695020	4695860	So let's get,
4695860	4697740	we need to get you guys more money.
4697740	4698580	That would be fantastic.
4698580	4699540	No, that's what we,
4699540	4700700	what I always say,
4700700	4703300	what we need to do is to give my detractors,
4703300	4705100	my people who are not critics,
4705100	4706460	but actually assholes,
4706460	4707540	more money,
4707540	4710260	because what you're seeing is the dynamics
4710260	4713180	of hunger game mentality inside of physics.
4713180	4714860	And as a result of this,
4714860	4717420	we're not able to behave constructively,
4717420	4719740	we're not able to behave collegially,
4719740	4721420	when we separate ourselves
4721420	4725220	so that certain people on stage never encounter critic.
4725220	4727780	I was at Seifu in 2011, I believe,
4727780	4729820	where Joe Pulczynski and Eva Silverstein
4729820	4732300	were talking about string theory in one of the rooms.
4732300	4734620	And I went in and I listened to Joe's version
4734620	4736460	of the history of string theory and I raised my hand.
4736460	4739140	I said, they're like seven or eight things
4739140	4741460	that you just said that are not true.
4741460	4743660	And I went through them and Joe too is credit.
4743660	4745540	I said, yep, yep, that's fair.
4745540	4746780	Yeah, that's true.
4746780	4748900	That happened the way you said it, not the way I said it.
4748900	4751380	And I watched Eva go white, right?
4751380	4753060	She was just like, he's gonna have to speak.
4753060	4755300	And she had had previously prepared slides
4755300	4758100	that duplicated many of the same claims.
4758100	4759780	One of which, for example, is that it wasn't
4759780	4762380	that we never thought about higher dimensional brains.
4762380	4763460	It was called string theory
4763460	4764780	because there were actual arguments
4764780	4766980	that those higher dimensional brains were guaranteed
4766980	4768700	not to be part of the theory.
4768700	4771580	And so once you actually go through the reconciliation
4771580	4774300	where you say, let's talk about the eight times we were wrong.
4774300	4776100	We said that there were finite number of theories,
4776100	4777460	then there turned out to be a continuum
4777460	4779340	where those things were extreme.
4779340	4780860	I can go on and on and on.
4780860	4785860	In all of those situations, by not forcing people to say,
4786060	4787020	yeah, we were wrong.
4787020	4789140	And Joe Pulczynski is a really good example.
4789140	4790660	I was pleased to see him on your list,
4790660	4793380	not for string theoretic issues or quantum gravity,
4793380	4795300	but because of the effective theory.
4795300	4798140	And he was a good enough scientist to say,
4798140	4800220	you know what, you got me, you're right.
4800220	4802100	He also said to me something, which, you know,
4802100	4803180	I want to be in the world.
4803180	4805340	He said, you, Eric, talk a lot about quantum gravity
4805340	4806180	and string theory.
4806180	4807820	And sometimes I don't think string theory exists.
4807820	4808780	I said, what?
4808780	4810780	He said, sometimes I just think we're running subroutines
4810780	4811900	for Ed.
4811900	4814060	And I thought that that was a profound moment
4814060	4816500	that in general, one of the things that happened,
4816500	4819140	which you may or may not know or feel or understand,
4819140	4821820	is that when you would come up with a new idea,
4821820	4823860	in a previous generation, everyone would look around
4823860	4825620	and say, well, what does Ed say?
4825620	4827940	And it had to do with the fact that people felt
4827940	4829820	that Ed was channeling the cosmos,
4829820	4831780	like Jimi Hendrix played the guitar differently
4831780	4833220	than everybody else.
4833220	4834900	And so it was like, well, what would Jimmy say?
4834900	4835740	What would Jimmy do?
4835740	4836660	What would Jesus do?
4836660	4838260	And you can't do that.
4838260	4840300	You have to actually say, well, here's my opinion.
4840660	4845020	I may be wrong, but the fact is we have to go back
4845020	4848060	and say, why do we have this fictitious history
4848060	4849380	of the last 40 years?
4849380	4851900	And let's also celebrate all the great stuff
4851900	4854500	as per your thread and also my arguments
4854500	4856740	about the fact that we actually put quantum field theory
4856740	4857860	on a more solid basis.
4857860	4859700	It's highly geometric.
4859700	4861860	And I believe that the geometrization of quantum field
4861860	4864060	theory and its divorce from physics
4864060	4866620	is one of the great intellectual achievements of our time.
4866620	4868500	And it deserves to be celebrated.
4868500	4869860	It's just like wrong way, Kerrigan.
4869860	4871500	You think that you're going to end up as Lindbergh,
4871500	4873460	but you end up going the wrong direction.
4873460	4876220	All right, well, this has been the end of round one
4878380	4881780	of this thriller in San Diego.
4881780	4883420	I want to thank both of you guys.
4883420	4885820	And hopefully we can do a round two,
4885820	4888420	but actually I'm more interested in doing something,
4888420	4891340	not on camera with you guys and just going through
4891340	4892940	some really fun physics.
4892940	4896980	I learned so much from you, both of you guys.
4897020	4900340	And I think Dan is really a role model
4900340	4902380	for many young physicists.
4902380	4904420	I said it in the previous podcast,
4904420	4906300	never have I been so glad to be a goner,
4906300	4908580	to be a thief, to steal your life from other universities.
4908580	4910580	Cause I think you really do exemplify
4910580	4913020	what a theorist or what a physicist should be.
4913020	4914500	Not a theorist, an experiment.
4914500	4917420	You're interested in both and you're curious.
4917420	4918740	And then that means so much to me.
4918740	4922780	And Eric, of course, is always so delightful
4922780	4924620	because you know, I used to say,
4924620	4925980	the way to put a physicist down and say,
4925980	4929060	well, he or she knows the history of the field really well.
4929060	4931300	But you put your money where your mouth is.
4931300	4932540	You're very devoted to it.
4932540	4934740	I don't think it's for personal attention.
4934740	4936580	I don't think it's for, you know,
4936580	4939540	the satisfaction of fighting the previous wars
4939540	4940900	as generals often do.
4940900	4943140	But I think it's for the sake of heaven
4943140	4945340	in the sense that we are trying to understand
4945340	4946580	a universe that we came into.
4946580	4947940	And we are like those fish
4947940	4949980	that don't really know what the water is.
4949980	4952020	And you guys helped clarify, for me,
4952020	4954380	simple experimental cosmology.
4954380	4956980	So now I want you guys to say one thing about Dan.
4956980	4958620	Yes, yes, sir, yes, please.
4958620	4961420	I also think that people often on the internet
4961420	4962980	would post these popcorn memes.
4962980	4964740	Oh, people are going to conflict.
4964740	4967300	And the reason that we don't get great fights on the internet
4967300	4968380	that are actually productive
4968380	4970460	and that help us learn about the subject
4970460	4972740	is because we don't have a sense of Queensborough rules.
4972740	4974580	And one of the things that I just think is terrific
4974580	4977220	about Dan, who I've never met before,
4977220	4979420	is that I had a high level of trust
4980460	4982900	that he was focused on the physics
4982900	4986300	and not on scoring points, dunking and dragging.
4986300	4988860	I think people don't remember what a critic is.
4988860	4991340	I believe that Dan has a certain sense of my critic
4991340	4992620	and I his.
4992620	4995020	But the point is not to blind him
4995020	4997740	or do small knuckle manipulations.
4997740	4999940	Iron chic jumping, turnbuckle.
4999940	5003140	The key point is if you want really good conflict,
5003140	5004860	you have to establish Queensborough rules
5004860	5007020	by people who are not going to go for the jug killer,
5007020	5009340	bite off an ear when they're in one of these things.
5009340	5010500	And it's been an absolute pleasure
5010500	5011900	to come down and have this conversation.
5011900	5014820	So touch gloves, Dan, anything else you wanna say?
5014820	5018220	I would say, I mean, I do, even that thread,
5018220	5020580	I would say part of the role of a critic
5020580	5022220	is not to be negative all the time.
5022220	5024420	I mean, the real value of the critic
5024420	5026940	is by being negative at times,
5026940	5029180	when they're positive, it gives real meaning.
5029180	5032780	And so I view that as a, nobody's being positive up there
5032780	5034860	and let me be positive out in the world.
5034860	5037140	And look forward to big things to come from Dan
5037140	5040580	and another episode with Eric coming out soon.
5040580	5042940	For now, Brian Keating joining you
5042940	5044940	from University of California, San Diego.
5044940	5047300	We're blessed to have brilliant colleagues
5047300	5049860	like Dan Green and friends of the show,
5049860	5050820	like Eric Wineside.
5050820	5052740	Stay tuned, more great episodes coming up.
5052740	5054980	Suzy Sheehy is coming out this week
5054980	5058140	and a special surprise guest coming next week.
5058140	5060180	So stay tuned for now, signing off.
