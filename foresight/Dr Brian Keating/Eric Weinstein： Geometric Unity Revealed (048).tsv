0	10920	Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.
10920	16880	A friend, a sort of superhero in some sense, although I'm going to try to challenge you
16880	20720	on a couple of things in your theories and in your politics and so forth today.
20720	23320	I hope we'll have a wide-ranging conversation.
23320	27120	But Eric Weinstein, pleasure to welcome you onto the Into the Impossible podcast.
28000	33360	Brian, it's a total pleasure to be here and I appreciate your strategy to build them up first
33360	37280	for an initial dopamine hit and then tear them down later during the remainder of the podcast.
37280	40880	That's right. Well, I always say, you know, I got that from your mother and if you want,
40880	45520	I can get it from your mother-in-law, how to introduce you. But either way, I think you're
45520	54080	in good shape. So I had on my podcast a couple of weeks ago now, a certain mathematician and
54160	59360	that mathematician generated some controversy, as they would say, in his homeland.
59360	65200	And I want to just say that the mathematician's last name begins with a W. I won't say who it is,
65200	70960	but I want you to sort of opine on this and let me know your feelings, how you would react to it
70960	77520	if the W stood for, let's just say, Weinstein. So it said, mathematician W, it has been said
77520	83040	about his theory, is that it's not clear what his goals are. He says he wants the intention
83120	88320	and feedback of the physics community, but his unconventional approach, soliciting public comments
88320	95600	on exceedingly long results from perhaps long ago, almost endures and shall it remain obscure.
96400	103520	Mathematician W says he wants physicists respect. The ones consulted said gaining it would require
103520	109040	him to recognize and engage with the prior work of others in the scientific community.
109040	113440	So this is not written about Weinstein, just spoiler alert, it's written about somebody else,
114080	117520	another person I have great respect for, but I'm curious.
117520	118640	But who's not a mathematician?
119200	121440	Who is not a mathematician. Right.
121440	126160	Yeah. So what do you think about this? Is this something that you can abide by or
126800	131200	what's your feeling on those sort of sentiment expressed by the author in this quote?
131200	133920	Well, this is a very difficult question and a very interesting one.
134000	142000	What I've been opining on recently is that we have two communities that are behaving very strangely.
142720	149040	And one community is central to the institutional world of science.
149040	151280	And the other is outside of that world.
152160	158720	Now, traditionally in very difficult fields like physics, we assume that people who are working
158720	161440	outside of an institutional framework are cranks.
162560	165440	And there are reasons that that has been a good general bet.
167040	171440	I think that you'd have to say that it has almost always been correct,
173280	175920	at least with respect to fundamental physics.
176480	181760	But we've developed a new problem, which is you'd like to say that many of the core
182800	186480	research programs currently, let's say at the heart of theoretical physics,
187440	193280	are fringe. But how can you call something fringe if it's at the center of respectability?
194800	199680	Because fringe means two things. One, it means peripheral, which these things cannot be because
199680	205040	they lie at the heart of our institutional science and our institutional sense making.
205040	214240	But wacky, yes, they are. So when you have a wacky center and you have a wacky fringe,
215040	220800	you need different language. And so I've come up with the term knark for the wacky center,
220800	226320	which is cranks spelled backwards. So right now, the problem that you have is you have a very
226320	230800	difficult situation. The language is too impoverished to capture what is going on.
231520	235600	Most of the people who are wacky at the center of theoretical physics
237280	242080	are competent. That is, if the field suddenly knew what it was doing again.
242800	247120	And when I say theoretical physics, there's just one stupid gotcha way to get through. I mean
247120	252160	fundamental physics. I mean the kind of physics that you go to bookstores to read about to fill
252160	258400	your soul with wonder. Right. And that's the topic of this latest physicist who starts with a W
258400	271280	is project. I mean, Stephen Wolff. Figured it out. Skadoosh. So the situation is that
271280	275600	I think that if the Institute for Advanced Study were to get their hands on the next
275600	280720	great thing, they would instantly go back to being regular style physicists.
281680	285120	And I'm not positive that most of the crank community would do that.
286400	291360	In some sense, what's gone on in the center is that you have physicists who are like generals
291360	295600	who haven't fought a war in forever, but have been playing war games and have increasingly
296560	302000	come to believe that the war games that they're playing is actually the business of the general,
302720	307920	nor a soldier or a sergeant. And in fact, what they've been doing is playing with toy theories
307920	311600	that don't seem to really be attempting to do what they're supposed to be doing.
312320	319200	So nobody knows what to do with this circumstance. And having the old war about whether or not it
319200	328240	is better to be respectable and incremental versus wild wiggy out there and to take the
328240	335680	hit to one's reputation. That seems like a very poor choice of activities in which to
335680	344080	spend our energy. A real problem, which is that since the 1970s, we haven't had theory-led
344080	348480	breakthroughs in fundamental physics that would take anyone to Stockholm as a crude measure.
350160	362240	But nobody knows what to do, the fact that we're coming up on 50 years of being lost in the
362240	369360	wilderness in some sense. And some people choose to deny it. They say supersymmetry, guts,
370080	376000	and strings and theory loop on gravity are all promising. One should just calibrate one's
376000	379360	expectations. Other people are saying, what the hell are you talking about? We've never
379360	385360	been in a situation this dire. I do want to push back just slightly on that, Eric, because I did
385360	393040	consult with a friend who is a colleague here at UCSD for just a partial list. This was done in
393040	396480	response to Peter White, who I know is a friend of yours and Sabine Haasenthaler.
397280	402640	They're kind of claims, again, similar to what you're saying in the lack of the dearth of progress
403200	408960	in the last four decades. And here's an incomplete list that I got back when I asked,
408960	413440	what are some of the theoretical-led, driven, fundamental physics breakthroughs? Here's a list,
413440	418880	incomplete list, thermodynamics of information, quantum computing, inflation, conformal field
418880	423040	theory in two dimensions, conformal field theory in greater than two dimensions, modern,
423040	430960	effective field theory, heavy quarks, binary black holes, superconductivity, and then cosmology.
430960	435600	Again, we can sort of debate. I don't even think these are the most impressive things,
435600	442240	necessarily. I would have said that the theory of the determinant line bundle and the Quillen
442240	451200	connection, geometric quantization, the rigorous founding of quantum field theory around issues
451200	459440	of enhanced boredism. No, I didn't think that was a good list. So it's not, I don't mean to be rude,
459440	465840	but I'm not trying to make this stupid kill shot here against the community. I'm trying
465840	471440	that the community is fundamentally dishonest. It's a dishonest community now.
471440	477440	It lies about its achievements. It lies about its failures. So I think that what I'm doing is I'm
477440	483600	giving it its due. I'm saying that I don't think guts are dead, grand unified theories.
483600	489120	I don't even think supersymmetry is dead. I think that the field doesn't know how to explain
489200	493760	itself. The field doesn't know how to defend itself. It lashes out at anybody who dares to
493760	501520	contradict the official narrative, and it's enough. I mean, we're just all sick to death of listening
501520	505920	to David Gross and Ed Whitten tell us what's what because we don't believe them.
506960	510160	Well, I think there's this, you know, and you've spoken about this, you have,
510880	517440	you know, sort of a Nobel worthy level of pithy three-letter acronyms, some even more famous than
517440	523440	others. But one of them that I do cotton to is this idea of the gated institutional narrative.
523440	527760	And I saw this on display and, you know, again, we can edit out anything you don't like. But,
528480	533440	but, you know, there were people that that as soon as you posted your, I think, you know,
533440	539360	it was maybe provocative to post it on April Fool's Day. But but nevertheless, it was reacted to with
539360	545600	with great almost vitriol bordering, at least in some corners of the internet on almost like ad
545600	550960	hominem level attacks. And I experienced the same thing when I interviewed Steven Wolfram.
550960	555520	And I asked people, you know, do you not think these folks deserve a voice? I mean,
555520	561840	you cannot claim that Steven is not a brilliant mind. You may think he is arrogant or that he,
561840	567760	you know, tends to be self promotional, etc, etc. And even people were criticizing me for not asking
567760	573600	him about his employee relations. And I said, look, I'm not 60 minutes. I'm going to interview him.
573600	578000	I'm going to be respectful as I always am. I'm going to hear both sides. And if you don't like
578000	583040	it, you know, I'll give you your money back on the internet for the subscription costs. But I feel,
583040	586880	I want to know. And again, we don't have to talk about anything you don't feel like talking about.
586880	592160	But I feel like this narrative that is being proposed is sort of part of this like the first
592160	596480	reaction, which I think is a sign of sloppy thinking is I'll believe it when it's published.
596480	603920	Now, I've heard people say that about the most extravagantly, you know, hyperbolic claims. I've
603920	609680	heard people say that about ordinary claims. And it's sort of become a canard, a shibboleth. And
609680	615440	I wonder how you feel about that. I mean, after all, we're treating peer review as if a, it's
615440	621040	sacrosanct handed down from, you know, God or Muhammad on the mountain. Or if you like, that
621040	627120	it's been around in science as a useful vehicle. Of course, it has utility and can have utility.
627120	632240	But what do you make of the veneration of peer review, which, which as Stephen Wolfram has said
633040	637600	in connection to this, he said, I think it's corrupt. I think traditional route
637600	642560	is a giant story of somewhat corrupt gaming. I think it's some sort of inevitable that happens
642560	647440	with these very large systems. It's a pity. And I point out, you know, there wasn't peer review
647520	652560	for Galileo. There wasn't peer review for much of Newton and wasn't peer review
652560	659360	for Watson and Crick in 1953. That's right. So, but now I also get a similar level of,
659360	665440	you know, criticism for people that who do say legitimately, well, you get a lot of emails from
665440	670720	true cranks and true people that are seeking hyperbolic attention. So how do you manage the
670720	675440	gated narrative with having some value? I always say the hardest thing is for somebody to strike
675440	679840	a middle ground, not to be polarized. That's easy to be polarized. It's bogus. If it's not peer
679840	684320	reviewed, it's corrupt if it is. How do you strike a middle ground? Is there a value in the middle
684320	691040	ground? Oh, that's a lot. And these are important questions. If you really want to dig into it,
691040	697680	I'd be game. Yeah, please do. All right. So first of all, Stephen Wolfram is breaking the rules
697680	701040	and there's suspicion that he's breaking the rules because he doesn't have a theory of everything
701040	706480	and he's advertising it as if he does using PR and he's using the weight of his name
707520	712800	in part to make a splash. And a lot of people who feel that that is wrong to do, particularly as an
712800	718720	individual, take exception to that. And one can easily understand why they would take exception
718720	726720	to that because it's an end run around some kind of quality. Okay, so that is probably true.
727680	733440	The other thing is that it complicates the life of a working physicist to hear constantly,
733440	739920	you know, my friend has an uncle whose best friend thinks he solved the theory of everything
739920	747200	and he has a perpetual motion machine to prove it. Will you come back to his house in Peoria
747200	752880	and check it out? Nobody wants to lead a life like that. And I think that that's entirely
752880	758480	understandable. So I think we have to sort of, first of all, just demonstrate that we're not
758480	764320	confused about why people would have this in a working world. It wouldn't it be great to have
764320	770400	a nifty little shibboleth and discount everything that came in. So if all the cranks, you know,
770400	776800	used red crayon on napkins, and that's how they submit everything, then you have an idea of
776880	783840	who's a whack job and who's actually down. All right, now you have a different problem,
783840	790400	which is that you've got whack jobs inside of the leading institutions who have been part of
790400	795520	whack job programs. And the whack job programs have whack job journalists inside of the whack job
796720	801680	leading papers. So if I open up the science times for years, there were these breathless
801680	807280	stories about how M Theory was going to give me better toast, clean my fingernails and give me
807280	813120	the theory of everything in short order. What happened to that? Well, those are institutional
813120	819280	canarks. And the problem is that the canarks really dislike the cranks. And the cranks are
819280	826080	trying to avoid the canarks. Now, first of all, you should know that I am not aware of the vitriol
826080	830560	that you're talking about from the professional community aimed at me. I'm aware of it towards
830560	836560	Stephen Wolfram. And I have been told that there are certain reddits that got shut down,
837840	844800	very personal, very unpleasant. And first of all, you have to remember that the field has a lot to
844800	852960	be embarrassed about. I've published essays in edge.org, critical of the String M Theory program,
852960	856720	particularly some of the nastiest things that they have ever done. I mean, it's just, it's so
856720	863120	bad, it is funny. One of the things, I forget whether David, whether Joe Polchinski maybe was
863120	868800	credited with this, but there was the claim that if anybody comes up with anything that isn't
868800	872880	String Theory, we'll just incorporate it into the String Theory program and say it is. So it's
872880	877760	like, oh, wow, does that have the locals play? Great to know. You know, there's this sort of,
878560	882960	when nobody's got a theory of quantum gravity, you have loop quantum gravity and String Theory
882960	887840	buying to be the leading non theory of non quantum gravity, because neither of them seem to work.
890000	896880	All of this leads to complete disarray. And of course, all that people have to fight over is
896880	904400	prestige that's left over, you know, from the feast that was served by Dirac and Einstein
904400	911760	and company, Feynman. And now their descendants are chewing over the bones that were thrown in
911760	916000	the scrap heap, and it's pretty slim pickets. So of course, people are going to be nasty.
916560	919840	I think that you have to expect that they're going to be nasty. And I think that you also
919840	925840	have to be sympathetic, which is that if you're slaving away on a tiny fragment of a long ago
925840	929760	abandoned program, because that's what you did your dissertation, and then you happen to have
929760	936000	an office somewhere in the dot edu ecosystem, you're pretty pissed off that a guy like Stephen
936000	942240	Wolfer, who might be, you know, pulling around flying private, you know, is hiring his own
942240	949280	armada PR agent, and creating a splash. So I think it's, I think envy, the invidious nature of this,
950160	955040	the palpable sense of failure, the sense that he doesn't really have a theory of everything,
955840	962240	etc. This animates people and it should animate people. And there are sensible questions like
962240	966800	why is it that people who come from outside the community only work on the theory of everything?
966800	972080	Why don't they work on adding a couple of extra digits of precision to some QCD calculator?
972080	976160	Right. Or, you know, revisiting or trying to prove ultimate was wrong.
978240	983760	Whatever. I mean, you know, it's always Einstein was wrong. And here's why I always feel like it's,
983760	986640	you know, it's like Dungeons and Dragons, they think they're going to get, you know,
986640	990800	Einstein sort of. It's so funny, because like the one thing that I really never want to do
991520	996160	is I don't want to damage Einstein. I feel like we're so blessed that he came through this way,
996160	1000320	like the trying to go after him because you want to teams really perverse.
1001360	1006800	So let's get into, you know, your approach to I want to make sure that we settle that because
1006800	1011920	people are going to focus on on this segment if they focus on this at all. I've built a fairly
1011920	1019600	large platform from talking about things other than physics predominant. And I'm not a physicist,
1019600	1023280	you know, people always say physicist Eric Weiss and I almost always correct
1024560	1029520	to be really quite good about saying, Hey, I'm not part of your professional game. I'm not
1029520	1037120	taking your professional resources. I'm not dirty, pristine archive, hep, hep, ph,
1039360	1045040	you know, preprint server. And they're still pissed off. They're still angry. And they're angry
1045040	1053120	because of hubris. You know, it takes a ridiculous sense of self possession and delusion
1053840	1057600	to think that you're going to make progress in the field that is probably the hardest field of
1057600	1064480	human endeavor that's been stuck for the longest time on the hardest problem. So I'm weirdly sympathetic
1064480	1070960	to these momsers. I don't know what you want to call them. They're very pleasant people.
1071840	1079360	I wish that they would, you know, I don't know, weed is legal. They should probably smoke a joint
1079360	1083440	chill out and actually think about whether this really represents where they want to be in their
1083440	1088960	lives, shouting at people after such a dearth of results or decades. Well, you know, my tag line
1088960	1092880	is always, you know, I love astronomy. I love physics because it's not like in astronomy,
1092880	1097280	there's a Republican constellation over there and there's a democratic comment over there. It
1097280	1103200	should be like a political free zone and not necessarily a safe space where, you know, ideas
1103200	1107840	can't be challenged. And, you know, part of what I respect about people like you, like Wolfram,
1107840	1112400	is that you're willing to come on and, you know, I'm not a pushover to just accept everything
1113040	1117840	that he or you would have to say. And yet I feel like it's extremely valuable. And I'm not just,
1117840	1122880	I would say this about anybody who's, of course, you have to get over some gate to use the Weinsteinian
1123760	1128000	expression. But at the same time, because there's only so much time in the day, let's be honest,
1128000	1133600	I only have so much time to do the actual work I get paid to do by the state of California and
1133600	1139440	also explore other things and do other projects. I think, A, there is a jealousy, there is a sense
1139440	1145280	of jealousy. But B, I do think there is validity to people that say, look, these people are bypassing
1145280	1153760	our traditional, time-tested modalities of going at and attacking scientific, scientific nature.
1153760	1160640	And, and then this guy who's very eloquent and very deep goes on Joe Rogan and he just blasts away
1160640	1166640	and he'll get more attention, you know, than the exponent of my H index. And I think that, that
1167200	1170880	there is a balance there. I can love to take this issue with that if you don't mind.
1170880	1175600	Yeah, let's go for it. Let's talk, the H index, by the way, originates here at UCSD by my colleague
1175600	1181040	Jorge Hirsch. And I tease him about that because his highest cited paper is actually about the H
1181040	1184640	index. And I hope to have him on the podcast that sometimes talk about attribution and credit.
1184640	1188800	First of all, one of the things that's interesting about the H index, if you think about it,
1188800	1192800	maybe you could apply it to Curt Goodell or somebody who published nothing.
1192800	1194240	Right, yeah, exactly.
1194240	1202400	Right. And so I partially have an aspiration if I'm going to have any impact on physics whatsoever,
1202400	1207760	God willing, I would love to do it with like an H index of zero or undefined in order to
1207760	1213280	destroy the H index because it's a proxy and people get very carried away with showing you
1213280	1218640	how much hard work they've done in a cargo cult that the general is nonproductive. So
1219520	1225600	it's a pretty bad proxy when it becomes circular. With respect to Joe Rogan, first of all,
1226880	1233440	your community has a huge problem. I can't tell you how bored most of us are hearing about the
1233440	1237840	multiverse or many worlds or entanglement. We're going to talk about all those, by the way,
1237840	1241920	but go ahead. Double slit experiment. It's not that they're not interesting. It's not that they're
1241920	1245600	not fascinating. It's not that they're not confusing and perplexing and deep and all these
1245600	1252480	things, but we've heard it 12,000 times before. And whether Sean Carroll has a new wrinkle on the
1252480	1259600	multiverse or not is irrelevant. The part of the problem is that you guys haven't even pushed out
1259600	1265440	the Dirac equation. People really know who Dirac is. They don't really know how to spell the word
1265440	1272960	spinner. They don't understand the hop vibration can be visualized. So with all due respect to
1272960	1278800	the community, you failed. You guys have just, you're terrible. And when I think there's something
1278800	1286480	sexy, actually, I want to go on Joe Rogan and I push out the hop vibration. Even if I don't
1286480	1292240	explain it, if I just show people, here is a principle fiber bond. This is the kind of object
1292240	1300720	on which gauge is taking. I've got artists all over the world trying to depict the basic structure
1300720	1306720	so that people can see rather than Lawrence Krauss going on Joe Rogan and giving some analogy that
1306720	1312160	is supposed to be about what gauge theory is. I'm trying to go on Joe Rogan and say, look, you know,
1312160	1321520	the Penrose stairs, what if that is actually the depiction of horizontal subspaces defining a
1321520	1327520	connection in some sense and what you're looking at is hollownam. I'm starting to get the right words
1327520	1332800	into the hands of dangerous children of the internet who may not have access to Princeton,
1332800	1337600	Stanford, or Harvard, or MIT, or Oxford, or Cambridge. No, I think that is valuable.
1338640	1342560	But like with a little bit of self-righteous self-judication,
1344160	1350880	match me. Instead of coming on and one more time telling me the same sort of mind-numbing stuff
1351440	1359600	that the article seems to go through both slits. Really? It's a way, dammit. Can you please just
1359600	1366160	explain this thing properly? Just get to the point where you're talking about her mission
1366160	1370960	operators and eigenvectors and eigenvalues rather than all this mumbo jumbo speak. And if you don't
1370960	1374720	mind, yes, I'm going to show them pictures that they've never seen before that you should have
1374720	1379440	been showing them. And so the fact that you didn't do your job, don't come after me blaming me.
1380160	1385680	Join me, beat me. Yeah, I think that that's some of the most valuable service. I know it's not
1385680	1389760	necessarily intentional. Maybe it is. I mean, knowing you, it could be intentional. That
1389760	1395360	controversy sheds sometimes too much heat, but it does bring light to these obscure topics. And
1395360	1401120	other guests that I've had on, and Joe always takes the best of my guests. I've had on Sean Carroll,
1401120	1406880	I've had on Stephen Wolfram, and I've had on Roger Penrose, and I know you've had on him as well.
1406960	1411360	And he's another person. And it's like, you know, what do you have to say about him? Of course,
1411360	1416080	he doesn't go on Joe Rogan for a time. The guy's 82 or something years old. He's not going there to
1416080	1420800	bolster his social, you know, his social hits. He's going on there because he's passionately curious
1420800	1427840	about extrapolating from the ivory tower where we both inhabit, although I believe less so in the
1427840	1432960	case of an experimentalist. And I do want to get to that. But he is, you know, bringing to mind
1432960	1439200	the same concept, Escher's, you know, infinite hyperbolic space projection, things that, yeah,
1439200	1444640	what if there is some young kid who instead of being who, let's just say she can have the choice,
1444640	1448720	she can look at the double slit experiment. That's wonderful. But yeah, what about looking at
1448720	1453680	projective, you know, spaces? What about these conformal transformations? I think there is,
1453680	1459040	and that he was the first science writer that I ever read popular science writer as a 17 or 18
1459040	1462960	year old. I didn't understand much of what he was saying. And if there was a Joe Rogan back then,
1462960	1466560	maybe it would have turned me on even more. And maybe I would have, you know, had a better career
1466560	1471280	as a theorist, although I doubt it. Maybe, but you know, I guess what my take is going to be is that
1471280	1475520	if I'm talking about the Wu Yang dictionary, and most physicists don't even think about the Wu
1475520	1481040	Yang dictionary, and these are the pivotal moments in your life, you know, I'm not taking a ton of
1481040	1485440	flack for saying wrong things. Sometimes people say, well, that wasn't a complete explanation.
1485440	1490960	Well, no kidding. You know, my last one went out to, I think it's now at 6.1 million people.
1490960	1496480	I mean, even for Joe Rogan, that's pretty large. Yeah, I think it is principal bundles out at scale,
1496480	1501520	so that I'm accosted in airports. What with people saying, I didn't understand there's,
1501520	1507680	there's a, there's a U1 vibration and an SU vibration. You're damn straight. I'm doing your PR
1507680	1512240	for you. You guys can't even figure out how to get enough dollars into your field to keep you
1512240	1518400	guys solvent. And despite the fact that I'm huge critic, I'm a huge critic of how you guys run your
1518400	1522480	shop, you don't mind. I'm going to try to get you some funding, some visibility, and I'd appreciate
1522480	1527680	it. Shut up. Thanks. Yeah, I think there is a lot of validity to that, Eric. I feel the same way
1527680	1531680	about Wolfram, and it would be interesting to get your, have Wolfram on your show at some point,
1531680	1535760	because I think, you know, these, or maybe I could host both of you at the same time,
1535760	1540880	because I think there is a value in, and I see a parallel between what he does and what you do,
1540960	1545600	and in your life's mission, at least in the geometric unity project. And it comes down to,
1545600	1550320	you know, kind of this classic description of what, you know, I think Einstein or somebody else
1550320	1556560	used to say is, is like wood and marble, you know, the kind of operational, quantized, you know,
1556560	1561840	computational world of physics and the pure geometric, you know, irreducible fundamental
1561840	1567280	side of the wood and marble, the wood is, is the stress energy tensor. Yes. But I would say,
1567280	1572160	actually, it's steel, because it should be manmade or human made, right? It shouldn't be wood as
1572160	1576800	naturally occurring and marbles naturally. I don't speak German, the original quote is in German,
1576800	1583520	and I think it's cheap wood, and sometimes it's even translated as balsa. I think it is. My concern
1583520	1589040	is that the real problem, of course, is in the marble, assume that the problem is in the wood.
1589040	1594800	Yeah. So let's, let's turn to that now. Just today, I heard a wonderful, read a wonderful piece,
1594800	1599120	not that I agree with it necessarily, but in Quanta Magazine, which is doing wonderful kind of
1599120	1606880	popularization of very complex mathematical and technical, you know, cosmological, etc.,
1606880	1611360	the hottest topics sort of in the field and has great writers to boot. And there's a piece today
1611920	1618720	that says what goes on inside of a proton. The quark math is still in conflict with experiments,
1618720	1623120	and they go through and they show, you know, these beautiful animations of a quark glue on plasma,
1623120	1627040	and they talk about this million-dollar math prize awaits anyone who can solve this type of
1627040	1633600	equation using QCD to show how massive entities like protons form. And I'm thinking like what
1633600	1637120	percentage of people are going to understand it, even in the physics community, as you point out,
1637840	1642400	I'm, I'm a physicist. Or in the math community. That's a part of the math gap, right? Luckily,
1642400	1647680	for me, I had Robert Brandenburger and Jerry Garelnik as, you know, cosmology and group theory
1647680	1652880	teachers. And I learned a great deal from them and from my colleague, Stefan Alexander,
1652880	1657760	I mean, your mutual friend, who is incredibly creative and productive. Otherwise, I wouldn't
1657760	1662480	have learned about it. I mean, I can go, I went basically my whole education without being required
1662480	1666320	to learn about group theory. And arguably, does it come into play when I'm building a microwave
1666320	1671680	radiometer for use at 17,000 feet above sea level? No, it doesn't. But at the same time,
1671680	1676080	it's the reason I got into physics in the first place. And so what I want to kind of just
1676640	1681520	toss around with you is on the experimental side, because I think we see things, you know,
1681520	1685760	hammer theory, we see everything like it's our own personal hammer, you're obviously coming
1685760	1691280	mathematically. But it gives you great visibility into, you know, I always say like, if I go like
1691280	1695120	this, you know, I have a problem, but I don't know, I have a problem. I'm covering my eye for
1695120	1700320	people that are listening on the on the audio version of the podcast. And I think getting a
1700320	1705680	perspective from outside, there are things that really hit a nerve when we talk about things,
1705680	1711040	especially things that may be untestable. And, and for example, the multiverse, I personally
1711040	1715440	have a lot of issues with the multiverse. And I know people celebrate, I actually asked Sean
1715440	1719600	Carroll, this branch, you have a lot of issues. Yeah, exactly. Right. I asked Sean Carroll,
1719600	1723920	you know, what would you say is the, you know, is the likelihood that the multiverse is true?
1723920	1729280	And he said 50%. And I asked him, well, what's the likelihood that God is true? He said less than
1729280	1734640	1%. He wouldn't say zero. He's, he's, he's certainly, you know, very, very knowledgeable
1734640	1739840	about how to ascribe his, his priors. But on the other hand, I think, yes, when you get into
1739840	1743680	these descriptions, of course, it's not, and I don't want to go through geometric unity,
1743680	1750240	except to ask you if we can post the PowerPoint in the show notes that you showed after your
1750240	1755120	April Fool's Day podcast, because I think, you know, people are leaping and saying, well,
1755120	1760560	you know, in 2013, you promised there was an archive paper coming and, you know, I look for
1760560	1766160	it. I don't see it. But would it be possible to post the PowerPoint that you use just for the
1766160	1769200	people? Because I don't want to go through it. You've gone through it with Joe. You've gone through
1769200	1775680	with Lex Friedman. But first of all, I mean, you can screenshot the PowerPoint. I can come up with
1775680	1784240	the PowerPoint. I get very innervated by this talk. Community is really badly behaved. And my
1784240	1789440	feeling is you don't really, I don't think you really care that much about the PowerPoint. Most
1789440	1793120	people in the community who have this kind of like paper or didn't happen, this kind of attitude.
1795200	1800000	This is shorthand for please just, just say a Lagrangian so we can go through it and invalidate
1800000	1807040	you. That's really the energy. The gain of institutional Lagrangian. Well, no. The point
1807040	1814160	being that a Lagrangian is a very clear and clean way of saying what a theory is. And there's
1814160	1818080	a fascination in the community, which is, well, if you think you've got this whole thing, why don't
1818080	1825040	you put your pen down and tell us what it is? And I'm not even necessarily that scared of that.
1825040	1830160	That's not the issue. The issue is you guys just aren't honest about where you're really at. You're
1830160	1835440	irritated. You're pissed off. And you're pissed off partially at me, but you're pissed off largely
1835440	1841040	at yourselves. And everybody knows it. And one of the reasons that I don't have a ton of fear
1841120	1847840	is that I don't have somebody else regulating my oxygen in the community.
1847840	1857280	So the issue of what a theory is, how to milk it for information, a lot of this was dealt with very
1858000	1865120	well in Duroc's 1963 Scientific American article, deserves to be very widely read, even though
1865840	1873520	our audience, he's somewhat used Schrodinger as his stocking horse, where he talked about
1873520	1882800	Schrodinger's failure to agree with experiment. And the issue is that apparently the Schrodinger
1882800	1887760	hadn't taken into consideration certain aspects of spin. So this has to do with what I would call
1887760	1897440	the suitmaker and the tailor. If you have a kind of a weird way of paying for things,
1897440	1902080	where whoever discovers the island doesn't get the island named after them, but whoever
1902080	1907440	climbs to the top of the highest summit on the island and puts a flag there, that's the name
1907440	1913600	of the island. So the guy who's spending his time tying up the boat at the dock gets beaten
1913600	1917760	by the guy who races to the summit. Okay, well, that's a pretty innervating thing, or like you
1917760	1923200	pay for the last leg of the relay different than who did the best time in the relay race.
1923200	1927200	You saw this with, for example, the Poincare conjecture in mathematics,
1927200	1933040	where somebody's building on several large steps, but it's a pro-man solution to the conjecture.
1933040	1938480	So you've got all these sort of issues of the political economy of physics and mathematics,
1939280	1947200	and, you know, this is what causes people to get really pissed off, because Dorak's point was
1947200	1953360	Schrodinger came up with the suit, but until the tailoring is done, you don't know whether it fits
1953360	1959200	the patient, which is experiment or, you know, the client. And so this is sort of the problem,
1959200	1964160	which is why do you want to deliver a suit to somebody who's going to claim that the tailor
1964160	1970000	made the suit when they do the last alteration? And I think that this is part of the problem with
1970000	1976320	copper, at least the naive application of copper, and people have to realize there's a price for
1976320	1984640	playing all of these incredibly innervating games with credit and pretending that nobody cares about
1984640	1990480	credit and that everybody behind the scene stabs each other. Being outside of the system, I've
1990480	1995200	never seen such a group of completely hypocritical people who all seem to only want to serve nature,
1995200	2000400	God, and Jesus, but on the other hand, what they really seem to do is behind the scenes demand
2000400	2005920	that they get proper credit, proper citations. You know, and just another quick point.
2007440	2013600	When Juan Maldesena won his breakthrough prize, he had to explain what he'd been up to, and he
2013600	2018560	was talking about gauge theory, and he had to illustrate it, and he chose to illustrate it
2018560	2023200	with the economics of exchange rates, which actually came out of work that my wife did at
2023200	2029520	Harvard. It happened that he didn't credit my wife's dissertation where some of this work appeared.
2029520	2034880	He knew about the, you know, and when I ran into him in San Francisco, he changed that. He also
2034880	2041360	diluted this a little bit by quoting some irrelevant work. So, you know, my feeling about this is
2041360	2046320	the community also has a huge problem not acknowledging people that it doesn't think are
2046320	2050960	going to show up at the next conference. You sort of know who all the regulars are, and you play with
2050960	2057520	them using the game theory. So, you would attribute outside of the community. Very often, the citation
2057520	2061760	games don't work. The credit games don't work because we don't have a credible threat. And one
2061760	2068000	of the nice things about having a relatively large podcast and access to some of the largest
2068000	2074160	platforms in the world is the community hasn't really quite figured out that you're not necessarily
2074160	2079600	going to see me at your conference if you don't invite me. But if you don't credit my work and
2079600	2084560	you start to, you know, talk about it, you are going to have a problem with repeated games. I
2084560	2089520	think the academic game works best when you have repeated games. And part of the problem with why
2089520	2095200	people take on cranky affectations when they don't start off as cranks is that they come to understand
2095200	2099680	that the system doesn't work as advertised. But if you want to get into the substance of what these
2099680	2104080	theories are, that would be fun too, not just talking around them, but talking about.
2104960	2108080	Yeah, I do want to talk about that. But just to circle back, you know, I mean,
2109040	2115120	you, it seems to be common for, you know, one of two different approaches. You can attribute
2115120	2120800	malice or incompetence. Now, it's hard to believe that, you know, Juan would be incompetent because
2120800	2125200	he is brilliant. So I guess, you know, if that's your only alternative to attribute something
2125200	2131520	malicious, that is, you know, that that's certainly your right. It's, it's a, it's a behavior pattern.
2132560	2141360	Look, I love Isadora Singer, who's been a dear friend of mine in the past. But he would forget
2141360	2146880	when he heard something from me, because I wasn't somehow properly in the right place in his
2146880	2152560	consciousness. We see this with women very often in meetings where they'll say something five minutes
2152640	2157760	later, a man will say more or less the same thing and everybody will say, ah, Jim's done it again.
2158640	2166080	Right. Matilda effect. Right. Call this he peating. Right. There's something called the Matthew effect
2166080	2173040	to hit. Matilda effect. Right. Yeah. And then there's the Matilda effect. So all of these things
2173040	2178880	have to do with the way in which our social brains compute how we wish to be diluted going
2178880	2184320	forward, who we wish to acknowledge. And we make an implicit calculation. Am I likely to see this
2184320	2191680	person tomorrow or not? Right. Yeah, I do look at it. I'm just here to remind people. It got more
2191680	2199600	expensive. Certainly, it is true that, that you have a prominence, which I think is unquestionably
2199600	2205920	earned that you've, you have developed a personality and a unique modality of thinking. You're also
2205920	2210880	incredibly courageous, which is one of the rarest of all traits. I don't think you really give
2211520	2218320	a figure, I'll say, because it's a PG conversation. On the other hand, I look at you and I see
2219360	2224560	these kind of a different image of a lot of my colleagues who are very dear. They kind of remind
2224560	2229200	me of these fiddler crabs that you see at the beach here in San Diego. They're incredibly well
2229200	2234400	developed on one side of their shell. And the other side is this puny little digit. But you
2234400	2239440	don't see them going around, you know, and kind of like berating the other crabs that have two
2239440	2246000	equally sized, you know, protuberances or whatever you call claws. And that it's kind of, it's puzzling
2246000	2250560	to me, because you see it for people like Mildegras Tyson, who is not, you know, an active scientist
2250560	2255760	or Bill Nye, who is an engineer by training, and they're outstanding communicators. And yet,
2255760	2261120	there's some of the largest targets of jealousy. It just seems strange. It's like me criticizing
2261760	2265760	the conductor of an orchestra for being, you know, getting attention during this.
2267280	2275360	Let me take my opponent's view as steel-mannered slightly. In part, it has to do with how much
2275360	2280880	deference and fairness these people give to the community that they are implicitly mining. So I
2280880	2285120	think everybody knows that they in some sense benefit from Mildegras Tyson's popularity.
2285680	2290080	You know, Brian Green is potentially kind of a more interesting version of this because
2291760	2296000	he's got great comic timing. Oh boy, that guy would have been fantastic in Vaudeville.
2296560	2302080	On the other hand, he's a straight up geometric gangster, you know, he can hang with the best of
2302080	2309680	them. I think that in the case of Bill Nye, the sort of the sense is, how did a guy with a bow tie
2309680	2314400	come to speak for the rest of us who are doing research? And so I think that there's, there are
2314400	2319760	healthy tension. I think one of the points that I keep trying to make is I'm not speaking
2320640	2326640	for the community as their voice. Like I may be pissed, but I also think, you know, I think I've
2326640	2331200	been very clear that the theoretical physics community is the intellectual version of SEAL Team
2331200	2336720	6 and our underfunding of theoretical physics is a tragedy. And it's in part what causes the
2336720	2343200	community to be unspeakably beastly to, to not only each other, but to outsiders.
2343600	2348400	Right. They're fighting over the crimes of the scrums of this cookie that's shriveling up.
2348400	2353040	Well, you guys need more money. You've struck the world's worst licensing deal. Somebody's
2353040	2357360	got to defend the theoretical physics community because you're not allowed to license what you've
2357360	2362880	contributed to the world. And therefore you can't, you know, if everybody had to pay for every
2362880	2370160	semiconductor instruction or every URL, every email ever sent, or every, every, all the protection
2370160	2374880	that came from the hydrogen bombs and lives that were saved to America by being able to end
2374880	2381360	whatever it is. It's enormous. It's enormous. The theoretical physics community should never
2381360	2386640	have to beg for another dime. But they should. The ought from is though, Eric, how do you actually,
2386640	2391680	what are you going to, are we going to apply a tax point? You call them taxpayer dollars. I'm not
2391680	2397120	a physicist. Those are $5 for the most part, the extent to which the modern economy is built on
2397200	2403520	physics, whether it's communications or computation or protection or chemistry or whatever.
2404560	2411520	Let's be clear. They're physics dollars. And we had a licensing deal and you guys
2411520	2417600	welched, you, the general public welched, taxpayer welched, don't bug me about your taxpayer dollars.
2417600	2422800	You guys are the beneficiaries of the best deal in history. Shut up, fund the theoretical physics
2423360	2427760	community. Yes, they're horrible. Yes, they're failing. Not doing their job. Yes, they're lying
2427760	2433040	to you. Start paying them. They will be much better. They'll still not be perfect. They're arrogant
2433040	2438400	because they're the reason for the arrogance. I don't hear anyone else saying anything remotely
2438400	2443920	like what I'm saying. And I try to be fair just like with Juan. I settled up our differences.
2443920	2448480	I'm not saying that I'm pissed at him. I am saying that it's a very common behavior pattern. I've
2448480	2454480	had the same issue with John Baez over the Actonians. Again, I can settle my differences,
2454480	2460400	but I'm just telling you that from the outside, it's very strange that when I go to a gathering,
2460400	2466480	I come in as a Harvard PhD. I'm treated one way, but if I come in as an employee of Peter Teal,
2466480	2471920	I'm treated as the dumb money that has to be convinced that we should throw it at the community
2471920	2477600	because community is doing the most mind blowing stuff of all time. When I start talking technically,
2477600	2481680	you see people have this feeling like, wow, you're not supposed to be able to do that.
2481680	2485360	Right. And then you go through this phase transition and break out the hop vibration.
2485360	2491920	I want to ask you, does this not result naturally as the evolutionary culmination of what I call
2491920	2496960	the academic hunger games? I mean, you start off and get into the best college. You need to do
2496960	2502000	all sorts of activities and get good grades and take good tests and so forth. Then you go to
2502000	2505440	college and you're competing in the physical sciences. Let's just say you're going to be a
2505440	2510000	theoretical physicist. You're competing with some of the brightest minds who have ever lived in your
2510000	2516000	peer group. You got to outlast them to get a good PhD slot. Then you got to shine as a PhD student,
2516000	2520640	get the attention of your advisor. Then you got to get a good letter of recommendation and a job
2520640	2525120	offer, a prestigious postdoc. Then you got to get a good, it's just a minor. It's gotten so much
2525120	2531120	worse since 20 years ago when I went through the final rung in this ladder. Yeah, go ahead.
2531120	2536400	We have to stop this. How do you stop it? How do you undo a 1,000-year-old tradition?
2537600	2541920	This is not a 1,000-year-old tradition. This has to do with Vannevar Bush, the endless frontier,
2541920	2548400	the expansion of the post-secondary education system. I think I was hanging out with the provost
2548400	2557440	at UCSD and he didn't even understand the effect of the Eilberg Amendment of 1976 by Dole in 1980,
2557440	2565520	the fraudulent NSF and NAS projections of a looming shortage that opened the floodgates
2566480	2572240	foreign labor universities, the misclassification, the student apprenticeship. There's an entire
2572240	2579600	recent horrible history of turning the modern professor into a surf, not just the graduate
2579680	2586880	student into a surf, but attempt to destroy academic freedom. If you cannot tell people to
2586880	2592160	screw off and know that you are still funded the next day and you can still come into your office,
2592160	2597520	the field is lost. Yeah, but I mean, so I do want to talk about, let's just go there now,
2597520	2602560	academic freedom. Is it still valuable? Is it still necessary? I make the claim that in my field
2602560	2607680	in experimental physics, until COVID-19, which I do want to pick your brains on, until COVID-19,
2607680	2614800	I had 100% employment rate for all my PhDs and my undergraduates. This 14 people as of yesterday
2614800	2621520	have become a PhD, they've gone out to professorships, prestigious post-docs and so forth. So there's
2621520	2627440	no gating up until that point that's certainly a seller's market, jobseeker's market up until this
2627440	2633360	level. I don't know exactly in the same sense in the theoretical market, although I have very
2633360	2638880	many friends, but they take fewer students and so it's a little bit normalized in that sense. But
2638880	2644480	in terms of academia and freedom, I mean, I could say whatever I want, but I could also,
2644480	2649040	even if I didn't have tenure, I could say, you know, I could say whatever I want also and go and
2649040	2654640	get a job in industry or go and get a job in finance. Not to diminish it, not to diminish it,
2654640	2659280	or sorry, just not to diminish it, but just saying that I have a valuable set of Liam Neeson-like
2659280	2665280	skills that I convey to my students that are very flexible. And I know that's true of theorists as
2665280	2670880	well. So to what extent does a professor of physics need to be tenured and guaranteed fiefdom for life
2670880	2677040	arguing against my own interests? But you know, or let's go sociology. Very important. Yeah, go ahead.
2677040	2682960	It's very important. This is the replacement of FU money. And it's not just about whether you have a
2682960	2688480	job. There's all sorts of ways to turn up the heat on a professor. You can put them in a shitty
2688560	2693680	office. You can give them a huge teaching load. You can humiliate them. There are all sorts of
2693680	2702080	ways to fire people who can't be fired. So there's no joke. Unfortunately, I've lived long enough
2702080	2708160	that it's no longer relevant, which is what's the difference between free speech under the Soviet
2708160	2715120	and American Constitution? And the answer is that the Soviet Constitution gives you the right to
2715120	2719360	say anything and protest your government, but the American Constitution guarantees your freedom
2719360	2728320	the day after. So the key question is, can you tell your field to screw off and still get grants?
2729040	2735520	That's a question. Can you tell your department chair that they're out of line trying to force
2735520	2743680	you to sign a diversity and inclusion of which you should, you know, tremble reverently with your
2743680	2750400	pen in hand to sign, know that when you don't sign, you're going to be fine. So I think that
2750400	2755920	partially the problem is also that you cannot say that giving academic freedom to people who
2755920	2761360	will never use it. If you overvet and you make sure that the people who get academic freedom are
2761360	2767280	the people you can trust never to need it, that all of these things don't work. The key issue is
2767280	2773920	you need dangerous, safe people. Dangerous by virtue of the fact that they can say everything
2773920	2778480	that needs to be said safe and that they're not going to abuse it to say things that shouldn't
2778480	2783520	and needn't be said. And if you can't have dangerous, safe people knowing that they're
2783520	2789120	going to be fine the day after they said what needed to be said that pissed everybody off,
2789120	2792240	but woke everybody up, then it's not academic freedom.
2792240	2798000	Do you really feel like that could happen if I criticize Ed Whitten? Am I going to get my
2798640	2806000	tenure shift or my teaching assignment at UCSD, you know, greatly enhanced, punished in that way?
2806800	2810240	Well, I'm not saying that there's a direct transmission mechanism. I didn't know that
2810240	2816160	you and Ed Whitten were in the same game. But I'll say that Ed Whitten is perhaps the finest,
2816160	2822000	you know, mathematician of our time, but that his leadership of the theoretical
2822000	2828400	physics community has been arguably disastrous and that he earned effectively as a
2828400	2835280	geometer and spent as a string theorist. That's a very dangerous statement if I was in fact at,
2835280	2841360	let's say, the Center for Theoretical Physics at MIT. And, you know, I feel about Ed Whitten the
2841360	2845600	way people sometimes feel about Voldemort, which is that you want to be very carefully saying
2845600	2850960	his name at this advanced age of my life. He's one of the few people that I find absolutely
2850960	2856960	terrifying. And that's not politically, just intellectually. The neurons on that guy just,
2857680	2864000	I've never seen anything like it. Yeah, I mean, just recently he came up with a way to test for a
2864000	2868640	black hole in the outer solar system. So now he is venturing into my turf. He's, he's gotten into
2868640	2874000	astrophysics. So I could be, I could theoretically be endangered, I suppose. Well, but I'm just
2874000	2879440	trying to say that part of the problem was I didn't care people after David Gross, David Gross,
2880240	2886240	who again, you know, fabulous physicist and one really the seminal figure to cross over
2887040	2893360	from the, you know, last major improvements in the standard model into the world of strings and
2893360	2899120	beyond. You know, he gave these talks year after year to sort of say where the theoretical physics
2899120	2904400	community was going. And there wasn't enough ability to say, are we going over a cliff?
2905440	2909040	Is this, is this crazy? Is this insane? I mean, what, what are we doing people?
2909840	2915120	Like that voice was silenced because people were terrified. I would hear people say, well,
2915120	2918720	I'm so glad you said something, but I could never say something. And I really disliked it.
2919920	2926240	So I mean, what way of incentivizing is there a market, you know, mode of, of operating?
2926240	2930560	Guys need more money. But I mean, I, I agree. I'm not going to turn down more money. And,
2930560	2934480	you know, ever since the Phoenicians, no, no, it's super important that you guys have a guarantee
2936000	2942720	universal physics income. Ralph, Ralph, Ralph Gomery of the Sloan Foundation said this thing to
2942720	2949840	me. He said, the bargain was always that you weren't going to get super rich as a professor,
2949840	2956720	but you would have the freedom that came from your job. And that's how we got great people.
2956720	2962480	When we lost the freedom, we stopped being able to compete effectively for the top people.
2963040	2969520	And so my version of this is you need the freedom of a billionaire without the wealth.
2971200	2976160	We have had, you know, and this is a huge shift in science funding, arguably, I mean,
2976160	2979840	the last, you know, 10 years has been some of the biggest struggles in
2980400	2985440	my career to get funding from federal sources and some of the most successful to get it from
2985440	2990000	private foundations, because I think there is sort of a freedom that comes with the private
2990000	2994800	foundation. And yeah, you can talk about the FU capital that they can supply. But on the other
2994800	3000000	hand, they also have priorities that may not align with the priorities of the entire nation,
3000000	3004560	right? So, so I wonder, you know, if you're talking to, you know, somebody who like Jim
3004560	3009440	Simons, who's been criticized for merely pursuing his own intellectual interests, I don't think
3009440	3013920	that's fair. It's like a guy's working on a cure for autism, you know, by what standard?
3013920	3019280	Jim Simons isn't all around fantastic. Yeah, he's a unique human being. A unique human being.
3019280	3027280	But Jim Simons has the correct instincts. There's nothing more important, in my opinion,
3027920	3031440	for the preservation of humanity than theoretical physics.
3032240	3039360	Yeah, you think it's actually culturally relevant to the survival of a society? If so,
3039360	3043360	how did we do without it, you know, until the 1940s or so in 1930s?
3045040	3049760	Well, I don't agree with that. I mean, my feeling about this is, first of all, that
3051520	3056480	it's necessary for the survival of humanity for a couple of different reasons, which have to be
3056480	3065520	pulled apart. The first of which is theoretical physics is unique in the sense that it somehow
3065520	3074320	trains the pure mental facility and the gritty mental facility to work together like nothing
3074320	3078800	else we've ever discovered. I'm not saying it's not possible to duplicate it again,
3079440	3084960	but even relative to mathematicians who I could make an argument might even be smarter in a certain
3084960	3093040	kind of technical sense. The power of the hybrid vigor of pure cleanliness and pure grit
3094400	3099760	produced something where we never knew that the human mind was capable of those flights,
3099760	3104960	as we've seen in theoretical physics. So I really believe that if you wanted to talk about, you know,
3104960	3111360	the gym that trains bodies to be at their peak, well, for the mind, that's theoretical physics,
3111360	3118000	fundamental physics at best. It's a dojo. All right. It's the dojo. And the idea that you get,
3118000	3123920	like, I'm going to say this the horrible way, if China was smart, they go and buy the Institute
3123920	3128480	for Advanced Study. They just buy out all those guys. They're like, what, five guys who are just
3128480	3132880	all of them unbelievable, whatever my issues are? I mean, people are like, I don't understand,
3132880	3136800	are you for Ed Whitton? Are you against him? Well, I have a complicated relationship with
3136800	3142720	these guys. Right. If I were China, I would pay each of those guys $10 million a year
3143920	3150320	to have a deal. And the fact that we wouldn't bid that up is because we're idiots, right? So
3151760	3158400	you want the world's smartest people happy and at your beck and call. And maybe you call them up
3158400	3165120	once every 25 years. It's a bargain. Shut up. Pay it. It's their money anyway. There's two
3165200	3171920	grandfathers and grandmothers created it. So if you look at it, and I agree with you that physics,
3171920	3177120	I broaden it to experiment because I think the best experimental physicist should know
3177120	3181200	the most about theory. Actually, we are encumbered. I was going to get to that. Yeah. Okay, go ahead.
3181200	3186800	Take it away. So CERN is the most obvious, but then there are like high precision experiments.
3186800	3191600	There's all the amazing stuff doing at the South Pole. There's the fact that LIGO can pick up these
3191600	3199040	faint. There's an analog in the experimental end of this, which is look at what we've done.
3199040	3204720	This is the reason that you put computers, you know, to their limits, engineering,
3204720	3211040	tolerances, creativity. All of this stuff is hugely valuable any time you want to convert it to
3211040	3218240	something else. But people want to do the sexiest stuff when they're not being tasked for practical
3218240	3223280	stuff. The Manhattan Project was an engineering project. It wasn't really a theoretical physics
3223280	3228320	project. It did have a positive effect. If you look at the Shelter Island conference,
3228320	3234960	clearly these guys were not suffering from the same level of learned helplessness that the
3234960	3240160	Dirac's quantum electrodynamics had induced before renormalization taught us how to extract
3241120	3249120	measurable predictions. But in all of these things, the key issue is the first aspect of
3249120	3253600	why you find theoretical physics is that you want to know that you can call up the world's smartest
3253600	3259840	people whenever you need them to solve your analytic problems that have grit and indeterminacy
3259840	3264320	in them. And there's an absolute parallel on the experimental side. The second thing
3265280	3272560	is that we learned just over 100 years ago that we've got fundamental limitations on visiting
3272560	3279040	rights to the universe. And I can't stand to constantly hear that Elon wants to go to Mars
3279040	3286640	to save the world because the Mars, the moon, Titan, and Celadus. There's just not enough
3286640	3293440	diversity locally to do any. And so we may be trapped here. It may be that whatever Einstein
3293520	3299040	figured out, more or less, is unhackable. And that even when you move from effective theories
3299040	3306960	to ultimate theories, it can be that there's nothing new to do. But right now, between 1952
3306960	3313920	and 1954, you put the world on notice that we're going to blow ourselves up unless we have a
3313920	3320880	wisdom explosion, which doesn't look like it. We got to get off this rock. And you've got to stop
3320960	3326720	hearing that as science fiction or somebody who watched too many Star Wars movies.
3328400	3333680	It's only going to take one device going off in a mid-level city as a demonstration of prowess
3333680	3337360	to let people know that you can't always stop something because of the ballistic missile.
3337360	3346160	You can't detect all of the enriched fissile material. Whatever we're in, theoretical physics
3346160	3351600	changed the game with the hydrogen devices of the early 50s. And we are now in the adaptive
3351600	3357840	valley and we're going to die here as a species. If we do not get out, the only group of people who
3357840	3362720	can get us out are either the people who would upload us into silicon and forgive me, that sounds
3362720	3370000	completely ridiculous to me, or the people who could find out whether or not when we pass from
3370000	3378560	effective Einsteinian theory to ultimate theory, we are in fact limited. So to determine that,
3378560	3382880	right, so I wanted to bring this up actually in a series of rapid fire questions at the end,
3382880	3388800	where I'm just going to ask you to say yes or no if you have greater than 50% credulity and
3388800	3394960	various items. You're asking a non-physicist. No, I know that, Eric, but you're a thinker and you
3395040	3400480	know very much about risk and you know you're very well schooled in Bayesian reasoning and I think
3400480	3411040	I'm just an internet personality. And podcaster, noted podcaster. So you look at the Drake equation
3411040	3416400	and it was born right after, you know, World War II in 1961. You know, Frank Drake came up with this
3416400	3420800	famous theory and actually most of the terms in that equation, it's not really an equation that
3420800	3426400	would satisfy any mathematician of note, nor does it ever come along with concomitant error
3426400	3431200	bars, error analyses, it's always just multiply these fractions together and you'll get a likelihood.
3431200	3435600	But the one uncertainty that we haven't revealed, in other words, we know star formation rates of
3435600	3440720	galaxies, we know the number of stars that have habitable zone like planets, we don't know L,
3440720	3445280	the lifetime. And it sounds to me, and we had a conversation about this last week offline,
3445280	3450480	you know, that you are actually very deeply, it's not, it's not just, you know, kind of a headline,
3450480	3455360	you know, grabbing thing that you are very concerned. I don't know if you're a member of the,
3455360	3460240	you know, atomic bulletin, whatever this union of atomic scientists, bulletin of atomic scientists,
3460240	3465120	or if it's respectable, I'm not part of it. You would never join such a such a group. No,
3465120	3470400	no, no, I would never be asked. I see. Okay. This one's run by your friend Lawrence Kraus. So I
3470400	3475280	wonder if it could be. I've never met Lawrence Kraus. Okay. So, so in the Drake equation, the
3475280	3480480	letter L stands for the longevity, lifetime of a civilization. Do you really believe that,
3480480	3485360	that we might be in our final hour, you know, 30 seconds to midnight as this clock is being set
3485360	3492800	currently? I'd be astounded if we don't do anything clever that we make it 300 years.
3492800	3497280	Wow. So your approach, and we briefly touched upon this, but I want to delve into it,
3497280	3503920	does geometric unity offer a potential avenue to, you know, break the speed limit to, to
3503920	3510160	transgress C as a fundamental limitation? If so, it'll be very interesting to Stephen Wolfram,
3510160	3515600	because he's claiming in his competing, you know, approach to find a fundamental theory.
3515600	3521360	He has a competing approach. Well, I'm saying his, his theory of the fundamental physics project
3521360	3527040	is, is that the speed of light emerges from what he calls branching space, which I take to be
3527680	3533040	essentially a Hilbert space like object that can subdivide a certain rate. And because of that
3533040	3538400	limitation and the propagation of these networks, nodes, et cetera, in branching space, the speed
3538400	3543520	of branch, again, I'm summarizing it, you can watch my interview with him or watch one of his many
3543520	3549440	well produced and, and, and delightful interviews. But on the other hand, he believes that he can
3549440	3555200	predict it. It's actually a retro addictive. So wouldn't that stand in contradistinction to any hope
3555200	3561600	to, to actually find that C is, is just a milestone, if you will, a speed limit that is not truly
3561600	3568480	fundamental? Yeah, I don't understand the question. Well, a geometric unity, can it, can, can the speed
3568480	3575120	of light ultimately be derived as a prediction from geometric unity? Or are you, are we sort of
3575120	3580400	hoping that it might have a, it might not be the fundamental limit? I mean, you're, you seem, you
3580400	3584160	know, we're worried about the lifetime of civilization, and we want to get far away,
3584160	3592320	farther away than Saturn, right? Yeah. Would you permit me to rephrase the question slightly?
3592320	3596400	Please. Yeah. Whether it works. So first part of it is,
3598800	3604240	people tend to feel better if they can link you to something like, Oh, well, your Peter Teal's
3604240	3610560	employee, or, Oh, will you and Stephen Wolfram have this rival? None of this is right. I'm,
3611120	3615600	I'm super glad that Stephen Wolfram is doing whatever Stephen Wolfram is doing. It has almost
3615600	3623600	nothing to do with anything. I know it doesn't. Okay. So just to be clear. I think what your
3623600	3634480	question should be is, first of all, how is Einsteinian space time recovered from within
3634480	3643840	your theory, given that Newton, for example, had to be recovered from Einstein in low velocity
3643840	3649280	situation? The question would be given the fact that you're not, because, you see, whenever I say
3649280	3655920	something about getting off this rock, people map that, Oh, faster than light. And that assumes
3656640	3662000	that you're still staying in the space time paradigm. Right. X four. The idea is that somehow
3662000	3671120	you've broken the speed limit in the four dimensions with metric. In essence, the claim is,
3671120	3678000	is that Einstein fill laid the metric bundle. In other words, one way of looking at Einstein's
3678000	3685120	theory in a modern context would be that he took four degrees of freedom. He built the metric bundle
3685120	3694320	on top of that, which would be a point wise bundle of fibers of dimension 10. Because if you take
3694320	3701520	four degrees of freedom, and you take four squared plus four divided by two, that 16 plus four is
3701520	3706080	20 divided by two is 10. You get 10 degrees of freedom, which is why Einstein's field equations
3706640	3715360	occur in sort of 10 coupled differential equations. Now, that object is only relevant for the
3715360	3720720	particular space time metric that Einstein uses to endow the four degrees of freedom
3722400	3729600	with this extra structure to create space time. What if that's the big error, that in fact,
3729600	3736560	you should be having the fields mostly propagate on the 14 dimensional space, which would be the
3736560	3741040	four degrees of freedom plus the 10 degrees of rulers and protractors otherwise known as symmetric
3741040	3750560	non degenerate two tensors. Then the idea is that a particular choice of Einsteinian metric is a
3750560	3757440	section of that bundle that section can be used to pull back information from the 14 dimensions
3757440	3763200	down to the four dimension. Then you have this interesting thing, which is maybe not all the
3763200	3769200	fields live on the 14. Maybe some are native to the four, some are native to the 14, but they all
3769200	3774800	appear to be pulled back on the four so that we constantly live in Plato's cave where we can't see
3774800	3780960	the 14. We sort of know that this 10 is out there because then in this 10 would sort of be the same
3780960	3788240	10 as the spin 10 theory that contains the SU5 grand unified theory, or more correctly my guess is
3788240	3795440	is that it lines up with the Petit Salam theory, which is a theory based on the group SU4
3796080	3807040	cross SU2 cross SU2. Now SU4 by low dimensional isomorphisms is oddly spin six, whereas SU2
3807040	3814000	cross SU2 is another name for spin four. So spin six cross spin four, four plus 10 is 10 again,
3814560	3820560	and so you get back to this magical number of 10, and I don't think that I've seen that much
3820560	3826960	identifying these 10 dimensions that are hidden in the Petit Salam somewhat more explicit in what
3826960	3831840	you guys call SO10, which you should call spin 10, but I don't want to quibble over terminology,
3831840	3840960	that's just logomaki. And then you have this issue where that actually has geometric and dynamic
3840960	3847040	significance, and what we're looking at is kind of the restriction of these fields to a filament,
3847040	3852080	confusing fields that are native to the four with needed fields that are native to the induced 14
3852080	3861520	dimensional structure. So that's how Einstein fits in to the observers in the most geometric
3861520	3868800	unity is broader than this. It doesn't have to use the metric bundle, but in the most aggressive
3868800	3875520	version of geometric unity, that 10 appears twice. And I don't know that that connection has been
3875520	3883200	much remarkable. No, I don't think it has. Is it true that you basically would have only fermion-like
3883840	3890640	particles, in other words, spin intrinsically spinorial operators or spinners that would then
3890640	3895600	compose both the particles and massive particles and also their mediators?
3896320	3904640	No. No, no, no. You would have, see, one of the key problems which I can't seem to get any
3904640	3910880	physicists to care about is that when you have everybody scurrying around saying that they
3910880	3916640	want to quantize gravity, which is sort of weird, it's a weird replacement, right? We used to want
3916640	3921360	unified field theories, and then somebody subtly said, oh, the Holy Grail is quantizing gravity.
3922640	3927600	An incredible sleight of hand. I find greatest taste. If you want to quantize gravity,
3928400	3933760	my key question to you is always about the electron as opposed to the photon. The photon
3933760	3941680	is a spin one particle would be a perturbation in a bundle that will exist whether or not a metric
3941760	3946720	is chosen. So if you imagine that you have a period of time when there is no metric between
3946720	3955040	observations, whatever that means, the ocean in which the photon is a wave still is well defined,
3955040	3961760	but the wave may not be known. What happens when you don't have a metric and you look at the electron
3961760	3968800	ocean? Well, then there's no ocean. In other words, there's a different feature with fractional spin,
3968800	3975360	which you're going to call fermions or matter as well, which is that finite dimensional matter is
3975360	3985440	not defined for what would be called gl4r double cover. So you have a flabby symmetry group,
3986320	3992400	and you only get the ocean of electrons once you take the flab out of it and make it rigid.
3993280	3998000	So if you want to quantize gravity, I always want to know, I understand sort of what you
3998000	4004400	might need in a world of photons only, but if there are fermions in your world, I have no idea
4004400	4008240	what you're talking about when you want to quantize gravity between observations because
4008960	4013520	it's one thing not to know where the waves are. It's another thing to misplace the Pacific between
4013520	4019760	every, you know, every moment that you don't have rulers in protract. This is a big problem,
4019760	4026720	and one of the things geometric unity does is it finds a spinner bundle that does not depend on
4026720	4032960	metric. It just can't have a four-dimensional space. It's forced into the 14, and it's not the
4032960	4037440	honest spinner bundle that you associate with the tangent bundle. It's very closely related,
4037440	4041040	something called the chimeric tangent bundle, which leads to chimeric spinners.
4042640	4048800	Upstairs in the 14-dimensional world, you're interested in both bosons and fermions. In
4048800	4054880	fact, you're just in something like the supergroup structure, and that object upstairs
4056640	4064160	pulls back to what we seem to perceive. As far as I'm concerned, I think we're having a 14-dimensional
4064160	4075920	conversation. Usually accused of being one-dimensional, not more. I think we're having
4075920	4080000	a 14-dimensional conversation, and we're taking a four-dimensional filament of it,
4080720	4085600	and maybe that's what Sean Carroll is talking about when he's going on, about how he believes
4085600	4091840	wholeheartedly in the multiverse. 50% of them anyway, 50% of them he doesn't. I don't know,
4092400	4098000	but I just think that in general, what happened is that around the time the unified field theory
4098000	4103520	gave way to quantizing gravity, nobody noticed the slight hand. Nobody noticed the real conceptual
4103520	4111920	problems, and that you've got generations of people repeating what their more recent ancestors
4111920	4117040	said that would have shocked, I think, a lot of the guys who actually built this stuff in the early
4117040	4123040	20th century. So you've mentioned, are we off of this topic for now, Eric? Or you want to?
4124080	4128880	I don't know. I mean, it's your podcast. If you want to talk about physics.
4128880	4133280	Yeah, I'd like to talk physics. I'd like to talk about, because again, I use
4133280	4138480	simple-minded. I like to treat everything like a nail, and my hammer is looking at things through
4138480	4143440	experimental lenses. Before we do that, we briefly touched on Popper, and we briefly touched on
4143440	4148480	Girdle, and I had this conversation with Stephen Wolfram, and I've had it with other thinkers
4148480	4155280	ranging from Freeman Dyson to Roger Penrose and Jim Gates, and I'd like to know your take on this.
4155280	4161200	I believe that physicists are suffering from math envy and Freudian language
4162000	4167840	replacing certain protuberance with the word math, and that's in a sense that Girdle at least
4167840	4172720	showed them the limits of what was possible in mathematics or impossible, the so-called
4172720	4180800	incompleteness theorem. And for decades, or maybe not, it's been taken as sort of sacrosanct at a
4180800	4189040	level, which I believe is unearned, that Popper provided an analog for physicists, for ways to
4189040	4195760	determine the credulity one should have in a physical theory, and that was whether or not it
4195760	4201920	could be falsified. And falsification has come to mean not just evidence or evidence against,
4201920	4208720	but even the ability to retro-dict certain things that are known to be subsumed within the theoretical
4208720	4218000	or physical theory. I'm wondering, do you believe in Popper's dialectic, or do you believe in his
4218000	4224480	demarcation claim, or is there something superior in your mind that could replace it? And then,
4224480	4229280	obviously, I want to turn that to geometric unity. So first, what do you think about the Girdle,
4229280	4235520	Popper distinction that I'm making here? These are these beautiful hopes that we're going to be
4235520	4240960	able to codify what science is and what science isn't. I think it's important that we say why
4240960	4248000	we're animated by this. Trying to get rid of cranks and losers and freaks and weirdos distract us
4248000	4252800	and figure out what the magic formula is that we can do science by so that we can say, look,
4253520	4259280	we're an open community. We welcome everyone who wants to try to pull the sword out of the stone.
4259280	4263760	And in fact, you guys broke the rules, so you guys don't get to try anymore. And the people
4263760	4267280	who are playing by the rules, good kids and the other ones get a lump in their stock.
4268080	4271760	So that's what our motivation is, because frankly, we don't want a huge line of
4271760	4277440	incompetence trying their hand. It takes days to debunk somebody who's filled with bunk,
4277440	4282640	and there's always 12 more behind that person. So I think it's really much better to talk about
4282640	4287520	the political economy of this and talk about the opportunity cost of debunking people. It's very
4287520	4296720	expensive to talk about it. What I find ridiculous is when people treat somebody like me like that,
4296720	4302960	because they're looking for a demarcation solution, which is, it's just very silly,
4302960	4307920	but the locals sometimes want to play that game. In general, I haven't found that many people want
4307920	4313920	to play with me, but let's keep going. I think that we're in some very different place with
4313920	4318400	Popper. And what I've said before is that the scientific method is actually the radio
4318400	4324480	edit of great science. And I mean something very particular by that. Great science is whatever
4324480	4331680	people have done to make major advances, and then whatever people might do to make major advances.
4331680	4335920	And I remember hanging out with Jim Watson, where he more or less said that Rosalind Franklin was a
4335920	4342880	much better scientist than he was. But his point was that we were great scientists and she was very,
4342880	4347280	very good. And we were not very, very good. Not just that great is better than good. It's two
4347280	4353760	different styles. You want to look at a really revolutionary essay he wrote, something like
4353760	4361760	succeeding in science rules of thumb or something like that. The style of great science is in general
4361760	4368720	indefensible. If you looked at, in my opinion, sort of the three great names of 20th century
4368720	4372240	physics, and I'm going to come up with a list that other people aren't going to love,
4372240	4377920	they're going to agree with me on Einstein and Dirac. And then weirdly, Frank Yang, C. N. Yang,
4377920	4381840	gets left off because people want to say Weinberg, Feynman, something like that.
4382880	4389040	I find that very weird. I think Yang is way up there. But those guys are the ones with their
4389040	4394800	names on the laws of nature. And if you look at what they say, they're all talking about beauty.
4395760	4403600	So they're not withstanding. But the problem is, have beauty as a method. There is the beauty
4403600	4409840	method in science. And it almost never works, except for our very best people. So if you go
4409840	4414720	to look right at the top of theoretical physics, everyone's talking about beauty, but it's like
4414720	4422320	three guys. And what do you do with a method that's a little bit like
4423280	4429680	what was it? The Blackbird aircraft that almost no one can fly, but it's the highest performance
4430880	4435280	airplane in the sky. Well, that's what the beauty method is. It's not about popper,
4435280	4438720	it's not about falsifications, but intuition, it's about guts, it's about
4440000	4446000	all the things that you want to tell if you're an average person, do not use this. It will
4446000	4452000	cause you to crash into the rocks. So trying to give advice for good science and advice for
4452000	4457280	great science is very frustrating because it's not the same thing. In general, great science
4457920	4467040	looks like bad science that happens to work. And well, it's like, okay, Kikuli is thinking about
4467040	4472960	a snake eating itself, and it turns out to be benzene. How are you going to recommend people
4472960	4476880	do that? There's an old joke or something about that, we don't use the Feynman method in this
4476880	4480080	class. What's the Feynman method? You look at the problem, you think you're hard, you're right down
4480080	4487840	the answer. We have to recognize that in general, there isn't a scientific method.
4488480	4493200	There's something that we can clean up and show to try to say that what we're doing is defensible
4493200	4496560	and that we're not talking mumbo jumbo, but I'm going to tell you the horrible dirty secret at
4496560	4503680	the bottom of all of this. It's about taste and everyone knows it. Whether or not you give,
4503680	4508240	you know, who was it? I guess it was Murray Gelman who gave Schwartz a job at Caltech because
4508240	4512320	he had the sense that this guy's working on something important. Whether I'm a string theory
4514320	4519200	booster or not is not really the important point. You know, Schwartz Gelman was right.
4520080	4526960	And you have this problem that at the bottom of all of this is not something that is sanitized
4526960	4534560	that can be cleaned up to show your parents. This is a terrifying, marginal, bizarre activity.
4534560	4539600	And this is part of why you get people who are so angry about people breaking the rules,
4539600	4547840	because honestly, those aren't the rules. Peer review has not been long in our world.
4549120	4555440	This is about personal communications. If you look at what happened with Freeman Dyson,
4556080	4562880	trying to defend Feynman to Oppenheimer and having to call in Beta. And then, you know,
4562960	4568080	Oppenheimer puts this note in his inbox, no low contendry, and the guy had a job at the Institute
4568080	4571760	for Advanced Study with no PhD and neither math or physics for the rest of his life.
4572640	4580720	This is how bad asses get shit done, is that it's about knowing people so intimately and trusting
4580720	4588160	people so intimately and having enough resources that you can run something like the RNA Tie Club
4588160	4593520	and share early results knowing that everybody's good enough to get their own goddamn Nobel Prize.
4593520	4597120	And if they don't get Nobel Prize, everybody knows who's good anyway. We don't really need
4597120	4602960	this internally. Nobody's confused about Stuckelberg outside of the, you know, inside the community.
4602960	4608400	We all know that he was super important. He got shafted. So it's very important to recognize
4608400	4619280	this is a small intimate activity of weirdos, freaks, madmen. It's a circus. And the adorable
4619280	4626320	focus on the demarcation problem that comes from history and sociology of science programs
4626320	4631680	is very touching and sweet, but they should get the hell out of our fields and let us get down to
4631680	4636320	work and do what we do best, which is breaking rules and doing anything that's been known ever
4636480	4641680	to come to an end. But of course, there's the, you know, greater possible abstract space of
4641680	4646560	possibly true theories or possibly true laws of nature than actually true. And I think what you
4646560	4650800	care about, you know, Einstein famously said imagination is more important than knowledge.
4650800	4655600	But as I said, I was talking to Sasha Sagan, Carl Sagan's daughter yesterday on the podcast.
4655600	4660800	And, you know, here's her father's doll of her father. And, and we're, I was saying, you know,
4660800	4664800	imagination is great. And it's wonderful to have it. And we should cultivate it. Obviously,
4664800	4669200	Arthur C. Clarke Center for Human Imagination. But I don't want my neurosurgeon, God forbid,
4669200	4673440	you know, to be like, I'm going to be really creative, you know, and curious about, you know,
4673440	4676720	Brian's brain surgery, God forbid, you know, I want him to have a lot of knowledge or her to
4676720	4682720	have a lot of knowledge. And in the case of, you know, these theories, who decides that's wrong?
4683680	4689360	Well, you, so you would like to have a creative approach to, you know, things that have a true
4689360	4694560	yes or no, I'm arguing Dirac wouldn't have been Dirac. He said, it's more important your equations
4694560	4697520	be beautiful than that they be right or something to that effect.
4699360	4703040	More important to have beauty in one's equations than that they fit experiment.
4703040	4707600	Yeah. And so it sounds like you agree with that. And I'm saying the ultimate, Dirac didn't become
4707600	4714320	Dirac until we discovered the truth of his, of the Dirac equation of the existence of,
4714320	4718240	which he was wrong about originally identifying the positive. I mean, I'm not faulting him.
4718240	4722080	Obviously, he went on to a good career, despite what Brian Keating might think about it. But,
4722240	4727280	the point is, it is the arbiter. I might be arguing my own book, but, but I'm arguing that
4727280	4731600	we need experiment to, to validate it. And maybe that's the ultimate gatekeeper in your language.
4732400	4740160	Okay. So, so explain this. This is the problem that we're weak. And this is physics bowing down
4740160	4748400	to history and sociology of science. The key point was, why did Einstein know what he was doing
4748400	4753280	when Einstein and Grossman appeared, I think in 1913, which is vaguely said,
4754080	4759280	the answer is something like a linear expression in the Riemann curvature tensor equal to the
4759280	4765440	stress energy, not specifying what it was. Then he gets it wrong. And he says it's the
4765440	4775680	Ricci tensor distilled. And that was shown not to be, what's the operator you guys call it,
4775680	4781840	perpendicular to the orbits, co-variantly, not co-variantly constant, but divergence free.
4781840	4786640	Maybe you call it divergence free. So then he puts in the one half scalar curvature correction
4786640	4792000	to that. And that's not enough because of Hubble. So then you put in the cosmological
4792880	4797520	and then Hilbert finds, okay, your super complicated equation is actually the simplest
4797520	4802880	Euler Lagrange equation that comes from the simplest action. You know, it's like, okay, well,
4803840	4810080	how did he know ahead of time that he was on the right path? He kept correcting it. And then
4810080	4816560	this whole thing about the electron versus the positron. Now, Dirac wasn't wrong. He was
4816560	4822720	insufficiently courageous. And, you know, this is exactly where I'm going through, which is like,
4822720	4829760	when you have detractors, you're constantly trying to placate your detractors. Oh, no, no,
4829760	4835760	I didn't say that. I didn't mean that. Oh, please, please. I mean, it's just stupid. The issue is,
4835760	4842080	if you'd let him say, okay, yeah, I don't have the answer for that. If you stop pushing for
4842080	4847040	agreement, stop pushing for immediate agreement with experiment. I mean, this is the difference
4847040	4853920	between authors and copy editors. The copy editors have taken over at some levels. You've got the
4853920	4858800	lunatics promoting the string theoretic agenda, which has completely failed that they can't be in,
4859360	4864080	they can't be honest about. And then you've got the copy editors, which is like, you didn't say
4864080	4872480	Simon says, it's like, shut up enough. It's something in between. It's a very fine sensibility.
4873360	4877600	And it has to do with a tiny number of people. The thing is intrinsically elitist,
4878800	4882880	is what you're using before you get to the ability to agree with the experiment.
4882880	4886560	Is the question that in the end, it has to agree with the experiment? Of course.
4887440	4890400	But like, that's some super late stage thing. And again,
4890400	4890800	Oh, yeah.
4890800	4895280	It's a problem of privileging the tailor as if the tailor made the suit.
4896080	4900240	But I got to agree with the experiment. He put the last dot on the last eye.
4900960	4906000	Really? I mean, are you that soulless that you can't actually recognize that
4906000	4908400	Hilbert was not in a race with Einstein?
4909840	4915120	I think if you look at it and you see, you know, you see the prestige levels, and I'm not, you know,
4915120	4919840	one for going through the sociology of science any more than I believe you are, but you look at
4919840	4926240	the prestige afforded to physicists. And, you know, it goes, it goes, as you said, it'll go,
4926240	4932880	you know, Einstein in this last, you know, 150 years, you know, Bohr, it'll go to Feynman, it'll
4932880	4937760	go, if it makes it to someone who did an experiment, it'll be Fermi. And, you know, we can argue and
4937760	4942080	debate it whether or not he was. So I think you're certainly right. The prestige goes to it. And I
4942080	4944640	think I can't shut up about Madam Wu.
4944640	4950320	Yeah. Right. You look at that. And then you look at many of the great discoveries by quote,
4950320	4955520	unquote, experimentalists or non theorists and, you know, resulting in Nobel prizes or other
4955520	4960400	metrics. Pick your favorite one. You know, our first serendipitous discoveries that we, you know,
4960400	4966960	maybe even the theorists had discounted. But, but it's usually not, I think Dickey is an exception,
4966960	4972640	because I think he was equally, you know, facile with with his theory. And he was a top notch
4972640	4977360	experimentalist. He's kind of my hero in that sense. And he harkens back to the Galileo model.
4977360	4986000	But, you know, that being said, if there were ways to channel, to test GU, I mean, could, could we
4986000	4991200	speculate as to what they are? Because I think, I think, Eric, there are ways to test it. I mean,
4991200	4993920	you are talking about certain things in your, in your lecture.
4993920	4995600	I'm not trying to avoid that, Brian.
4995600	4996720	Yeah. No, I know you are.
4996720	5000400	What I'm trying to avoid is, is that I'm trying to avoid the deep...
5000400	5004400	infant mortality, the infant mortality that would come from, oh, this is not worth pursuing,
5004400	5008400	because he's not putting it in a journal and requiring an experiment. I know that's a high bar.
5008400	5018000	No, it's not that. It's just, I'm sickened by watching a noble family forget its role in the
5018000	5026640	world. Right? Like, you know, it's the arrogance without the accomplishment. You guys haven't figured
5026640	5033280	out, you have to tell the interlopers from outside. You know, this is something, it's
5033280	5040720	an elitist activity. Like, as much as I hate to say it, the top three guys in the 20th century
5044880	5049760	were just different. They were, they were using different methods. I might even in group Feynman,
5049760	5053520	and I might talk about Stuckelberg, which people aren't going to necessarily want to hear about.
5053840	5064720	You can't, it's not egalitarian. It's, it's not fair. It's not a fair subject. And if you want,
5064720	5068400	well, tell me, tell me what science is and what, what it isn't so that I can apply the rule. It's
5068400	5075360	like, okay, when you're up at, when you're up this high above the tree line, the world works
5075360	5080320	differently. And nobody, there's no reason that an ape should be able to do these things. It's
5080320	5089120	a huge surprise that this is even possible. With that said, my frustration is that this
5089120	5096560	noble family has fallen into so much poverty that it can't behave properly scientifically.
5097520	5103280	And my story about Oppenheimer and Dyson was that maybe, maybe Dyson did need Beta to come in and
5103280	5110160	say, Hey, pay attention to the kid. He's got, he's got it going on. But it got done. It worked out.
5110640	5117440	People did not lose their livelihoods, their jobs. They didn't need PhDs. It's like, we knew who
5117440	5123280	was good and who wasn't. We gave them time. We gave them space. And so you're coming after me.
5124000	5128640	Huh, the joke's on you. I'm not even, I mean, I'm using none of your resources at all. What are
5128640	5133040	you going to do? Cut off my oxygen? You can't. Absolutely can't. You can cut off my internet.
5133760	5142000	Yeah, but you want to get back to testing. The key point is, imagine people came to say,
5142000	5146320	instead of, Hey, how do we get rid of you? They said, we're really interested.
5147680	5151200	What do you think you might be telling us? We know you're not a physicist. We know that you're
5151200	5156400	working at a geometric level. We know that it needs to be quantized. We know that you don't
5156400	5161360	understand exactly how we calculate and quantum field theory. Marcus, you're terrible pedagogues.
5163600	5170240	Um, what could we do constructively? I'd be all over that. Well, I've got some suggestions. Say,
5170240	5175280	let me just say something. Yeah, go ahead. Brian Keating, Professor Brian Keating is unusual
5175280	5181440	in that he's been after me for years to come to UC San Diego and lecture, which is very courageous.
5181440	5184880	So I don't know if I'm courageous, but I know, sir, that you are. I want you to be
5184880	5190400	a visiting scholar here, actually, which it would be an absolute honor, be an absolute honor.
5190480	5196400	What I would say is a bunch of new particles that I can read off their properties
5197120	5203200	relative to the internal symmetry groups. So we've got weak hypercharge. We guys have been
5204080	5209440	strong internal quantum numbers. There are a huge number of new particles that are predicted in
5209440	5214960	this theory to exist. Now, the instant I say the word prediction, I get into a different thing.
5215440	5220560	First of all, what, what energy level would we have seen them? You know, where, where, where would
5220560	5225680	they be in the, in the, in the, in the, in the Swiss and the decay rates, blah, blah, blah.
5225680	5231520	And it's like, okay, so that's that energy of whatever. I don't know how to do all that stuff.
5231520	5236080	I can tell you that if it was somebody else coming up with this theory, they'd say, oh,
5236080	5238800	well, we would think that we should have seen them. That would be like
5239520	5244720	Dirac saying the antiparticle of the electron must be the proton because I don't know of a
5244720	5249280	positively charged particle of the electron because the positron hadn't been found by Anderson.
5249280	5255680	Stupid Dirac. Yeah. Stupid Dirac. Right. But like, if you pressure me, I don't know,
5255680	5259520	and I'll make the same mistake Dirac makes, and then you can have your Heisenberg come out and
5259520	5264800	say, oh, Eric didn't know about this. Let's leave that energy aside. Yeah. If it was somebody inside
5264800	5268640	of the community, they might say, look, I've got something that fits almost everything,
5268640	5271680	and it's off a little bit over here. Let's tailor it together.
5272640	5275920	Well, that would be an invitation to a conversation. What could we do? Is there
5275920	5281360	a new field that we might introduce to suppress it? Maybe this is actually naturally occurring.
5281360	5288400	Same point about Dirac and Schroeder. You know, maybe, oh, you didn't take into account this
5288400	5292880	aspect of spin. What can I tell you about the theory? First of all, I don't think that what you
5292880	5297920	guys call antimatter is antimatter. I think there's an entirely different sector that would
5297920	5302560	properly be understood as antimatter. I think there's a 14-dimensional space. You guys are
5302560	5307280	applying these things all in dimension four. I think that there's spin three halves matter that
5307280	5312800	is actually real. I don't think that one of the three generations is a true generation. I believe
5312800	5319280	that if you amp it up in terms of energy, it will unify with other particles you've never seen.
5319280	5325920	I believe that probably in gravitationally weak places, what we see is a decoupling of equations,
5325920	5330000	but the near black holes, you might very well see the things that have been decoupled become
5330000	5336240	coupled, and therefore a lot of stuff might come surging into view, and so that what was dark might
5336240	5340320	become light. I mean, there's any one of a number of things that you can read off.
5341440	5348320	I don't think that I've had a single, friendly, competent inquiry in a month
5348320	5352800	since I released it. Well, yeah, I've been thinking about it since you released it,
5352800	5357040	and we made contact last week. I want to talk to you about, well, first of all,
5357040	5361280	I want to talk to you about something you kind of made as an offhand comment in your April Fool's
5361280	5364480	Day podcast, and I'm sorry to keep calling it that. It's just easier for me to remember.
5364480	5370240	Oh, that's what I tried to do. I wanted, if this works, let's imagine, just dream with me.
5370960	5371520	Yeah, yeah.
5371520	5372480	Soon that it works.
5372480	5373200	Yep.
5373200	5374800	Published on April Fool's Day.
5374800	5382480	Right. And every year, all the pent-up energy of all of these communities would,
5382480	5387760	you'd be able to air these things without losing your job. Oh, this is the Weinstein tradition.
5387760	5392640	Like, you want to talk about honoring me. Imagine that every year we could say things like,
5392640	5399040	I wonder if stress doesn't cause ulcers. I wonder if grains should be at the base of the food pyramid.
5400000	5406960	I wonder whether or not the Yamabi problem solution in the literature really works.
5407600	5410400	I wonder if the weak force might be asymmetric.
5411760	5419760	You know, how many things have we been afraid to say? Like, with COVID, I'm positively convinced
5419760	5423920	that there are doctors who are looking at this saying, no, make no dissent, so this doesn't
5423920	5434080	make sense. It doesn't work. Something is weirdly off. The danger, the danger of this is that people
5434080	5440800	are holding back for fear of being drummed out of their fields. So the whole point of releasing
5440800	5449360	on April 1st is my fantasy would be if this were to work, not only getting humans off this planet,
5449360	5455840	but making sure two things. One, that an H index of zero became a respectable thing, saying,
5455840	5460800	I choose not to avail myself of your insane community and its bizarre rituals because you're
5460800	5465280	knarks and you're trying to fight the cranks, but lots of us are neither knark nor crank.
5466160	5476560	And every year, I want you to know that you have a day where you're free. Yeah.
5477520	5481920	The same thing. Like, I think David Gross is not leading the theoretical physics community
5481920	5487680	properly and is brilliant as Ed Whitman. I think he's contributing and not lose your job.
5488480	5493280	Yeah, I kind of see it as a, what's that movie where they have like one day of the year they
5493280	5501920	can commit any crime. But as another listeners are screaming, I mean, I'll put it in the show
5502000	5508320	notes, people, don't worry. But there's a, and then unavoidably, if you are, it'll be essential
5508320	5513520	to quote that it was released on April Fool's Day. So I think it's a brilliant piece of intentional
5513520	5518320	or unintentional. It was recorded on April Fool's Day, I released, missed by a few minutes. I know,
5518320	5522640	I know, but I'm just going to keep calling it that. Anyway, in your, in your, in the podcast,
5522640	5528400	you talk about, you know, one of the great moments of, of relief for you, at least at some point,
5528400	5533760	when you discovered that, you know, your theory wouldn't work if neutrinos were massless,
5533760	5538160	but it did work because we know that they have masses. We don't know what their masses are.
5538160	5544480	And I wonder if you are aware, you probably are, but, but it's not absolutely known that the,
5545200	5550160	that all three neutrino species have mass. In other words, there's only known to be a mass
5550160	5554320	difference, a mass squared difference to be technical between two, you know, the two different
5554880	5559200	eigen, eigenstates. But we don't know, actually, one of them could be massless. Would that,
5559200	5565600	in some way, false, if we discover that one species is massless, you know, mu one or something
5565600	5570720	like that, one flavor, then would that, would that be a falsification opportunity for the
5570720	5576400	popper? What it really needs is it needs, if you think about the SU five theory, let's say,
5577360	5586480	grand unified theory, there's like a five and an anti representation, you can put in an inactive
5586480	5594080	singlet. But the important thing is, is that it'd be 16 particles in a generation. And so the issue
5594080	5599280	that I was having, it wasn't even necessarily the case that it wasn't, that there weren't 16
5599280	5604240	particles. But people were still very much trying to be conservative and saying, well, why don't
5604400	5613520	hypothesize, if you have, what is it, a right handed neutral, you know, then it's effectively dark.
5616160	5623360	And so the key issue is just that there'd be a spinorial representation, not really about mass.
5624480	5630320	So it's easier to say it in terms of masses and neutrinos, but I'm not trying to hide anything.
5630320	5636080	So I'm just, I'll say the more, the more correct version is, it has to come from a 16
5636880	5644720	dimensional representation, or rather a spinorial representation to the end, or
5645760	5649920	you can do it more broadly with the Rarita Schwinger, but it's a very restricted class of it.
5652960	5658640	So that would not be, you know, if we, her cosmological experiments like Simon's observatory
5658640	5664880	and bicep, et cetera, are trying to, you know, in some level constrain the mass and neutrino,
5665440	5671440	the sum of the mass of neutrinos. And then that combined with reactor experiments might actually
5671440	5677040	reveal the absolute masses instead of just the sum of their squares and square rooted, so to speak.
5678000	5683600	I'm getting questions from a listener who wants me to ask you, is a distinguished professor at
5683600	5687360	Brown University, and he's asking me to ask you in real time.
5687360	5688800	Does he play the saxophone?
5688800	5693520	He does play the saxophone. He does. He's also the president of the National Society of Black
5693520	5698480	Physicists, which I am a proud honorary member of. And yes, it is Stefan Alexander,
5699760	5704240	best friend and best man at my wedding. And Stefan's asking in real time, what is your
5704240	5707840	theory? You have to say about the cosmological constant problem or about dark matter. We've
5707840	5713760	sort of hit on antimatter. Tell us, answer Stefan's question about the cosmological constant
5714320	5715440	and or dark matter.
5716720	5723520	So first of all, I would say that the cosmological constant would not be a constant. It would be
5723520	5727280	a VEV. I mean, look, I'm going to try to speak physics and hang.
5727280	5728480	Yeah, please do. Yeah.
5729200	5730640	But if I screw up.
5731440	5732320	It's okay. You get a pass.
5732320	5733440	Don't try this at home, kids.
5733440	5735920	You could put on the mathematician hat if you make a mistake.
5735920	5744320	Well, we don't talk like this. I would say that it's a VEV and the VEV is lured away from zero
5744960	5751600	because there is a curvature piece that is pervasive that as the universe is spread out.
5753040	5759120	Got to keep talking like this as the cross section three dimensional space like cross
5759120	5767440	section is spread out that VEV has gotten very low. But it's still non zero and that the
5771760	5776720	look, let me just say it this way that that you're luring something away from zero potentially
5776720	5782560	because you've got a topological contribution. And if you have some sort of
5783280	5788080	Gauss-Penet theorem, then you have to be able to recover the topology from the curvature.
5788080	5791520	So you could have a reason that you couldn't get rid of the curvature, but you could spread it out.
5791520	5796720	And therefore you have counterbalance in Germany with respect to dark matter.
5798320	5799280	There's a lot of it.
5800160	5804880	Part this is the decoupling. So the claim is that the matter wasn't dark originally
5805920	5811600	in high gravitational situation, but it became dark. And as the VEV went down and effectively
5812560	5818560	a coupled equation broke into effectively decoupled equation. And the decoupled equations
5818560	5825440	would have things like dark light, dark glons, axions. So there's a ton of
5826560	5833040	there's a ton to be speculated and you don't know that it broke the way your half broke.
5833040	5839040	So if you iron sort of one half of the stuff. And again, when I say half, I don't
5839920	5845840	there's stuff that we haven't found in our half in this theory, stuff that is decoupled.
5847280	5855600	So, so there's like, it's more than half would be dark. But you might be able to say, look,
5855600	5861200	I don't know exactly how that the other part broke. But what I would say is,
5862000	5869600	you know that how it would unify. The example I just give to people who are watching
5871040	5878480	is if you have a hand, you see three fingers, two and four, your digits two and four pretty
5878480	5883120	symmetric and the middle finger is symmetric. But you could say, Oh, I wonder if there's a
5883120	5888640	symmetry there where my index and my ring finger are mirror images of each other.
5888640	5893120	And then you throw in these two and you say, Oh, shoot, well, maybe it's spontaneously broken.
5893760	5898480	And, you know, these things are like, weirdly often, maybe my thumb and my pinky are more or
5898480	5904560	less the same. And then you find out, Oh my God, it's thumb to thumb, not thumb to pinky.
5905280	5911360	And this stuff is dark because it's decoupled. And so this is all remaining to be found.
5912000	5917280	And this is where the proper anti matter would be. But because you're not even aware of the 14
5917280	5920960	dimensional substrate, you're thinking about everything in four dimensional terms, which
5920960	5929760	is after it's been pulled back. And so if we're done with that thread particular answer, because
5929760	5934400	I've asked Stefan, he's the man. All right. Well, he's not listening live. Unfortunately,
5934400	5937600	we should, we should have called them in, but I think we'll do that. Brother Stefan,
5937600	5942240	how could you do this? I know he's just, we're just texting back and forth sharing pictures of
5942240	5946880	our daughters. Today is his daughter's birthday. 12th birthday or something, right?
5946880	5952720	That's right. Yeah, I wish her a happy birthday from you. I want to stick with mysterious particles
5952720	5957440	and ask you if they've maybe already been found. I want to quote from an article in
5958240	5963200	not the most, you know, necessarily prestigious scientific journal, but Scientific American,
5963200	5967840	no less. It's not a peer reviewed journal, but it's a discussion of mysterious particles
5967840	5973600	lurking underground. And this is underground, the, the great icy continent that I've been to
5973600	5978800	a couple of times called Antarctica, in particular, two experiments that seem to show some concordance
5978800	5984800	and at least in the middle, this is Anita and ice cube. So ice cube, I think it'll be interesting
5984800	5989040	for you to talk to an ice actual ice cube scientist and an Anita scientist, but they claim
5989040	5994880	that the particles that they're finding, they don't have much understanding. And technically,
5994880	6000400	this is two particles, two events, but extremely high significance statistically speaking.
6001040	6006400	We call 5.8 sigma and seven sigma. So these are, you know, chances of fluke occurrence to that
6006400	6014080	the hundred thousand to million, one in a million level. And if those are possible, certainly,
6014080	6019040	you know, not seeing them, it would be like the magnetic monopole problem, which was claimed,
6019040	6024160	again, on a special date on a holiday to be discovered at Stanford Blaschke-Barrows group,
6024160	6029440	the Valentine's Day event, where he claimed back in 1987, I believe that he detected the
6029440	6036320	magnetic monopole in our universe. And that was later, later had to be reanalyzed and at least
6036320	6040480	to claim it wasn't a blunder. It was just not as significant. I think Gillian Maxwell has the
6040480	6045360	other one. Yes, that's right. They're, they're sneaking around trading between different places
6045360	6049600	on planet Earth. But what do you make about these particles? Is there a way to, I mean,
6049600	6054880	so here's an opportunity, geometric unity, you know, can we say how would these fit in
6054880	6060480	to the geometric unity framework? Invite me to a physics department. I will. You already have
6060480	6069040	an invitation. So we have not, yeah. But this is the issue, which is that I'm, I live so far off
6069120	6077680	of your grid that I'm not going to seminars. I'm not discussing the stuff with people.
6079680	6084080	So I don't really know how to answer that, but I can show you what the representations are,
6084080	6092640	what the equations are, what the Lagrangians are. And, you know, in large measure, what holds me up
6092640	6098400	from just sort of saying is this issue about the tailoring, which is I don't want to get
6098400	6102480	into a war about the tailoring. Well, you said it's this and actually you forgot a factor of,
6102480	6109280	you know, I over two, no, but, but I've played with these guys before and I can't
6110160	6113840	end it. I don't think you have. I actually have to challenge you there. I don't, I think you're
6113840	6118960	painting all physicists, including my brethren and sister in experimental physics with the same
6118960	6123440	brush that may or may not be justified. Okay. So, so great. So what I would like is I would
6123440	6129200	like a full-throated acknowledgement of work in economics and gauge theory from Mr. Juan Maldesena.
6129200	6134960	It would be my pleasure because I'm a huge fan of wands and I'm not a detractor of wands.
6136000	6141760	That held up as the credit that should have gone to myself and Pia Malani and your wife.
6141760	6144480	Yes, I know that, but I have no control over that. What I do have control over.
6144480	6150160	No, I understand that. I'm just trying to say you want to talk about the, you know, when I submitted
6150160	6157520	certain work at Harvard, which was peculiar to dimension eight, one of the things was, well,
6157520	6163360	if you can't solve this in the Arctonionic Projected Plane, then it's nothing. And well,
6163360	6169440	the Arctonionic Projected Plane is dimension 16. So I've played various games of Gotcha and Simon
6169440	6176880	says, and what you're looking at is somebody who is mature, but also is traumatized and traumatized
6176880	6186640	specifically by the nonsense of these games. So I would love to participate. I would love to play,
6187360	6194720	but in part what it means is I will not be playing the game. Like, you know, people always love to
6194720	6199840	say, Hilberg, you know, and Einstein weren't a race for the equation. They were not. If Einstein
6199840	6204720	and Grossman's first paper was all that we had and he never put anything else in it, it would still
6204720	6209680	be general relativity due to Einstein and Grossman. So I'm going to push back on your pushback and I'm
6209680	6216800	saying, no, the field really has a problem with credit and attribution. That was 116 years ago,
6216800	6221760	but I will say it's gotten worse since then. In a theory, I can't speak to that. I agree with you
6222320	6227680	in principle because I have seen nastiness. Maybe it's unique to UC San Diego, which has produced
6227680	6233360	such luminaries as your enemy, Dr. Garrett Leasy. He's not my enemy. He's my arch nemesis.
6233360	6239280	Arch nemesis. Sorry. We love Garrett here and he's a good friend, hopefully come on the podcast soon
6239280	6244640	as well. But I want to talk about, you know, this notion. There is a difference between
6245600	6253680	Let me just get back to it. It would be a great pleasure to see, to have the Anita experiments
6253680	6258160	translated from an experimental finding having to do with things apparently coming through the
6258160	6265760	surface of the earth, yada, yada, yada into bundle geometric language. And I can come some of the
6265760	6271520	way towards experimental, but, you know, I don't know, maybe that requires me being somewhere
6271520	6275280	for a week in constant dialogue. And I don't think I've done that since I've been at the
6275280	6281120	Perimeter Institute, you know, I know almost a decade ago. Oh yeah, we're a 90 minute, you know,
6281120	6286880	train ride away. So, but let me say this, I had a conversation with none other than Sir Roger Penrose
6286880	6291280	who's been on your podcast and I take it as somewhat of an inspiration to you as he is to me.
6291920	6296400	And he sat down and he told me, I believe that your bicep results were correct that you did
6296480	6301200	detect b-modes. And they just weren't from inflation, you know, he has a theory called the
6301200	6307360	conformal cyclic cosmological model that features an inflationless, you know, aeon system of aeon
6307360	6313600	cycling back and forth between different eras aeons as he calls them. And he pointed out evidence
6313600	6318000	being, you know, these so-called hawking points that he claims were discovered in our maps. And
6318000	6324240	he pointed to the images that we produced and the publication held the great fanfare in 2014.
6324240	6329360	And I stopped them and I said, Roger, those are basically, you know, PR shots. Those are,
6329360	6333840	those have zero scientific content within them. Anything that you find in it, what I would take
6333840	6339600	to be almost a falsification of your theory that these exist because these are highly processed.
6339600	6344320	And none of the details, it's just basically like a sketch. Like if I, if I released an artist's
6344320	6348960	sketch of a criminal, it's no more or less, you know, credible than the, you know, than,
6348960	6353760	than, you know, basically a computer generated image. It's just publicity. And he said to me,
6353760	6358240	these wonderful, you know, words basically like, Oh, well, then I have to reevaluate that. But I,
6358240	6362560	you know, could it be possible that this other element magnetic fields survive, not the black
6362560	6367920	holes? And, and so it launched a wonderful discussion. And, and he's, you know, 82 year old
6367920	6372880	guy and he wants to come here and he, and he is coming here on an annual basis. And we talk about
6372880	6377120	this and he's open to, and he's done an experimentalist. And I don't think he's in the orthodoxy,
6377120	6383120	although he's at a level of renown that you have to take him seriously. And, and so again,
6383200	6388000	I just want to say don't tar and feather all physicists because I think there is something.
6388960	6395680	Obviously, you know, I'm friends with Stefan. Yeah. I've spoken very highly of Juan of
6396880	6405040	Ed Whitton, Ed Whitton, Nima Arkani, Hamed, David Kaplan, the University of Maryland.
6406240	6412480	That's not what the problem. The problem has to do with when something goes wrong.
6412480	6416240	There's this sort of like, Oh yeah, yeah, that happens all the time happened to me when I was
6416240	6421520	a young guy. Like, there's such a lot, it's like being in Nigeria talking about corruption.
6422480	6430320	Love people and like people, but it's endemic to the field and it has to do with
6430320	6437840	there not being enough resources and not enough success. And my standards are
6438480	6446480	very different. Like, you know, if you imagine that you're a hot chick in an office in the 1950s,
6447680	6451200	you know, and you're getting patted on your, on your ass when you walk down the hallways,
6451200	6456560	and you try to imagine a modern woman having a reaction to that kind of a culture. Yes,
6456560	6461920	there are all sorts of things that are normal and supposedly good people for engaging them because
6461920	6467200	the norms are all shifted. Well, in a world in which nobody's really apologized for string
6467200	6471920	theory, except for maybe Dan Friedan at an appropriate level and all of the, you know,
6472720	6477440	things that happened as a result of it. The community is in an unhealthy state. I'm not
6477440	6483360	tearing all individuals. I'm trying to say that when this is over, we will look back on a lot of
6483360	6491120	this the way we look back on Jeffrey Chu and the bootstrap. This is a very weird period. And for
6491200	6497520	some reason, I'm not under its spell. And, you know, people say, well, you know, of course,
6497520	6503120	everything was very promising in 1984 with the anomaly cancellation. Well, no, it wasn't. It
6503120	6507920	wasn't then. It wasn't in the 90s with the second string theory. I mean, lots of interesting things
6507920	6514320	came out of it. But the point is, no, it was always nonsense. It was always crazy. It was always a
6514320	6520080	madness. And it had to do with the fact that the field hasn't succeeded. And that too many people
6520080	6526320	have concentrated power and that people who had, you know, how would, how would you go up against
6526320	6532160	an Ed Whitten and say, actually, even though you're so brilliant, I still think you're wildly off.
6532160	6538400	And even though you're so accomplished, I think you're incorrect. These issues or David or Joe
6538400	6543440	Polchinski, if you make the argument that everything is string theory after the fact, well,
6544080	6548320	can you imagine putting your hard work into something that no matter what you do, they're
6548320	6553360	going to claim it and they're telling you ahead of time. All of these things have to do with the
6553360	6561520	need to clean up the field. And I just want it to be very clear that I am both its biggest proponent
6561520	6567120	and critic. And if you want to think about it as Schrodinger's enthusiast, that's what I am.
6568960	6574400	Okay, well, good. I know you're super busy, but I can't resist if you'll indulge me.
6575360	6578320	Because it's so rare I get to chat with you and it's so much fun to talk to.
6578320	6583440	Brian, I got to tell you, I was thrilled and pleased this punch that you were going to take
6584160	6592240	neither a booster approach, nor let's throw, let's, let's, let's teach you a lesson approach.
6592240	6599040	So I want to say that there's not a lot I want to put on a jacket for, but this was important.
6599040	6604640	Okay, great. Well, I'll, I'll definitely be, be citing that quote on, on repeat to playing it for
6604640	6606880	my, my children and friends.
6621120	6628880	Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.
