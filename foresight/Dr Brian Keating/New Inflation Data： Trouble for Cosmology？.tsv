0	3080	In 2001, 20 years ago this year,
3080	5520	my colleagues Andrew Lang, Jamie Bock,
5520	8120	and Bill Holtzampfel came up with a proposal
8120	10640	for what would later be called Bicep.
10640	13800	Bicep has morphed over the years into Bicep 2,
13800	16440	Bicep 3, and now Bicep Array.
16440	18160	It's a stunning series of experiments
18160	20120	that unfortunately I'm no longer involved with
20120	22840	if you've read my previous book,
22840	24280	A Farewell to Arms.
24280	26680	No, losing the Nobel Prize.
26760	30720	I described how I came to both part ways with
30720	33720	and also be inspired by the continuing developments
33720	34920	with the Bicep team.
34920	36800	Recently, an analysis was published
36800	38080	in physical review letters,
38080	40960	one of the most prestigious journals in all of physics,
40960	43760	that has the most stringent limits to date
43760	47000	on cosmic inflation and the observable signature
47000	49240	that might or might not be present
49240	52900	from an early inflationary expansion of the universe.
52900	54920	While I'm not involved with the project anymore,
54920	57120	I'm fascinated by it and I wanna explain to you
57120	58560	the significance of these results
58560	60800	and where will cosmologists go from here.
60800	62440	Come along into the impossible.
64640	67280	Any sufficiently advanced technology
67280	69160	is indistinguishable from magic.
71000	74160	Spoiler alert, we haven't discovered anything in this field
74160	76560	in terms of unequivocal proof or evidence
76560	79240	for an inflationary origin of the universe.
79240	80800	There's a lot of circumstantial evidence,
80800	83480	as we've talked about, but there's also competing models
83480	85280	ranging from Sir Roger Penrose's
85280	88000	conformal cyclic cosmology to Paul Steinhart
88000	90440	and Aegis's bouncing cosmological models
90440	94200	and many more that we will discuss in future videos.
94200	97160	Now, the question of whether or not the universe originated
97160	100400	in a massive superluminal expansion known as inflation
100400	103400	has fascinated me personally since the early 2000s
103400	104880	when I first came up with the idea
104880	107360	to build a tiny refracting telescope,
107360	110280	one that Galileo Galilei would surely recognize
110280	112200	at the bottom of the world, Antarctica,
112200	113840	specifically the South Pole.
113840	117080	And over time, we made more and more sensitive upper limits.
117080	120560	That is, we've excluded an inflationary energy event
120560	122040	above a certain value.
122040	124120	Cosmologists parameterize the amount
124120	127320	of inflationary gravitational wave energy
127320	130040	by what's known as the tensor to scalar ratio.
130040	132000	The symbol is lowercase r.
132000	133720	And that is the relative ratio
133720	135560	between so-called gravitational wave
135560	138160	or tensor perturbations and ordinary density
138160	139360	or scalar perturbation.
139360	140760	I'm your density.
140760	143560	We've been setting limits on these effects
143560	145200	for over a decade
145200	148200	with the dedicated bicep series of experiments.
148200	150360	And this new recent result comes
150360	153840	from the bicep-3 incarnation of bicep,
153840	156440	which is a massive expansion to anything
156440	159480	I would have ever conceived of back in 2001.
159480	160920	This is an instrument that has
160920	163280	about a half a meter diameter aperture.
163280	165920	And it's significantly larger, almost three times larger
165920	167880	than the original bicep-1 aperture.
167880	170740	It can cram in many, many more detectors.
170740	172540	And couple those detectors
172540	176700	with very, very sensitive phased array-type technology.
176700	179940	In the original bicep-1, we only had 49
179940	182740	polarized metal machine feed horns
182740	184860	that we used to detect these tiny differences
184860	187580	in the amount of polarization in the microwave background.
187580	189660	But the incarnation of these telescopes
189660	191220	from bicep-1 to bicep-2,
191220	193900	which used transition and superconducting detectors,
193900	195300	to the current bicep-3
195300	198260	and now bicep array series of detectors,
198260	200100	has been a slow, steady increase,
200100	203940	not unlike your iPhone and its evolution from iPhone 1
203940	206060	all the way up until the current iPhone 13.
207260	210420	And back in 2001, we barely had iPods,
210420	212340	and it's just stunning to think about
212340	214620	how far the technology has come.
214620	216940	And these detectors are made by brilliant colleague,
216940	220740	Jamie Bach at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
220740	224700	and also supported via a wide variety of scientists
224700	225900	all over the world.
225900	226940	And even though, as I say,
226940	229980	I'm not involved with the bicep-3 and beyond incarnations,
229980	232900	I still can't help but feel a tiny bit of interest,
232900	234460	vested interest, if you will,
234460	236460	in the success of the project.
236460	240540	Recently, we heard a great fanfare announced
240540	242660	because of the threshold that was reached
242660	244220	by the bicep-3 experiment.
244220	248260	This is reproduced from the physical review letters article
248260	250020	I'll show it on the screen here,
250020	251740	that broke through this barrier.
251740	254260	It broke through what's called an uncertainty level
254260	256700	on the amount of tensor to scalar ratio,
256700	258460	the amount of gravitational wave energy
258460	259620	in the early universe,
259620	262860	produced presumably by an inflationary event
262860	264940	where the Inflaton scalar field
264940	267660	had fluctuations of the space-time metric
267660	269500	that then nucleated waves of gravity,
269500	270780	which travel at the speed of light,
270780	271900	endure for all time,
271900	274380	and can make it to our detectors even today,
274380	276500	but we choose to detect them and their presence
276500	278700	back on the surface of last scattering.
278700	280340	And that surface of last scattering
280340	282860	is an imprint, a fossil record of how the universe looked
282860	285540	when it was only 380,000 years old.
285540	287700	So we're kind of putting the detector system
287700	291380	back as close as we can to the source of the explosion,
291380	292740	if you will, if you think of inflation
292740	294420	as a sort of type of explosion
294420	297980	that ignited the big bang that we subsequently measured.
297980	300860	The results reported by bicep recently
300860	304580	indicate that we're below the 1% level of sensitivity.
304580	307660	The precision level needed to measure gravitational waves
307660	310220	has broken through the 1% barrier.
310220	311780	And even though the likelihood
311780	313500	of the gravitational wave signature
313500	317060	is slightly above a mere two-time multiple
317060	318460	of that one sigma result,
318460	320100	namely the two sigma upper limit,
320100	324100	is actually higher than the two times the 0.009
325020	327260	our precision level.
327260	329260	That's because the likelihood is slightly shifted over,
329260	332620	i.e. it looks to the naked eye, to the untrained brain
332620	334300	as if there's a slight detection
334300	336340	of gravitational wave energy, but there's not.
336340	338860	There's not significant enough to claim detection.
338860	341300	But the power and the procession
341300	343740	from the relatively crude measurements
343740	345380	that we made with bicep one,
345380	347220	and even other competing experiments,
347220	349500	including my own experiments, the polar bear experiment,
349500	351340	and other contemporary experiments,
351340	353540	have yet to approach anywhere
353540	355300	near this level of sensitivity.
355300	358820	Now, we hope to proceed even further back in time
358820	360660	and closer to the source
360660	364020	of primordial tensor perturbations if they exist.
364020	366340	And remember, the stakes could not be higher
366340	368460	because if inflation takes place,
368460	369980	many of the most prominent scientists
369980	372660	do believe that the multiverse paradigm
372660	375500	is also ushered into a state of believability,
375500	378020	maybe even proof by discovering this.
378020	379780	And that, we know for sure,
379780	381100	would be one of the conclusions
381100	383700	because that's what happened back in 2014
383700	386700	when bicep two made the premature discovery claim
386700	388460	that we had discovered gravitational waves
388460	391340	from the universe's inflationary epoch.
391340	392500	Now, that was retracted.
392500	394180	Later on, our conclusion was retracted.
394180	395020	We didn't make a blunder.
395020	396820	The experiment is exquisitely sensitive
396820	397900	and far more sensitive
397900	400420	than any other experiment ever done of this type.
400420	403660	But the interpretation as owing to a primordial cosmic event
403660	405900	rather than dust in the Milky Way galaxy
405900	409500	had to be essentially the disconfirmed result.
409500	411820	So we weren't able to establish this conclusively.
411820	413020	Now, it doesn't mean that gravitational waves
413020	413860	don't exist.
413860	414780	It doesn't mean inflation didn't take place.
414780	416980	It doesn't mean the multiverse isn't true.
416980	418340	But we would like to have evidence.
418340	421700	And so the bicep three team has now taken data
421700	424740	from more than just the one frequency we used in bicep two,
424740	426380	namely two millimeter wavelength,
426380	428700	150 gigahertz frequency.
428700	430620	Or with bicep one, we had three channels,
430620	434140	90 gigahertz, 150 gigahertz and 220 gigahertz.
434140	436540	But those detectors, the very few of those
436540	438820	operating in the higher frequency bands.
438820	441260	Now cosmic dust in our Milky Way galaxy
441260	444700	was the ultimate source of the large tensor to scalar ratio
444700	446980	we claimed back in 2014
446980	449620	and is the subject of losing the Nobel Prize.
449620	454620	But that was later found to be able to be removed
454780	456540	using data from the Planck satellite,
456580	458620	who were our competitors at the time
458620	462100	and still kind of frenemies and no, we're not enemies.
462100	464420	But we did eventually collaborate together
464420	467980	to reduce the uncertainty from dust
467980	469700	and actually show that dust could contribute
469700	471780	the dominant, the preponderance of the signal
471780	473460	that we claim to observe.
473460	475300	Now what's interesting is that bicep three
475300	478500	is able in the very near future, if not now,
478500	481020	to actually no longer need ancillary data
481020	483500	from another instrument, namely from the Planck satellite
483500	485900	to go deeper into the removal process
485900	487740	to get rid of the cosmic schmutz
487740	491180	that contaminates the local galactic neighborhood,
491180	493940	the dirty window, the dusty window that we must look through
493940	496020	with our cosmic instruments.
496020	498340	So it's fascinating to note that kind of the gauntlet
498340	500780	has been thrown down by this phenomenal team
500780	503860	that continues to work on a single goal.
503860	505860	And although there hasn't been a detection,
505860	507340	this is an important proving ground
507340	509660	because what it does is starts to eliminate
509660	512860	many, many classes, entire classes of models
512860	515300	of inflationary parameter space.
515300	517180	So we're able to really narrow down
517180	519660	and zoom in on the allowable regime
519660	523660	in which these inflationary models could have taken place.
523660	526620	Now, will we ever be able to rule out inflation?
526620	529220	I claim no because even if we don't ever observe
529220	531740	gravitational waves, we could still make the claim
531740	533780	that inflation took place, but the energy scale
533780	537700	of inflation was too low to manifest a observable background
537700	540060	of gravitational radiation that persisted
540060	542180	to this epoch of last scattering.
542180	545780	So we can't really falsify that inflation took place.
545780	549700	Some say that is a negative for the inflationary model
549700	552740	and it's non-comporting with the scientific method,
552740	555380	that things should be, as Karl Popper said, falsifiable
555380	557220	in order to constitute good science.
557220	558340	We've talked about that a lot.
558340	560580	I won't go into it again in more detail.
560580	563940	There are also haters of the inflationary theory
563940	566640	that because it posits the existence of a multiverse,
566640	569540	which some claim is antithetical to the scientific method
569540	571700	because everything that can possibly happen
571700	573380	does possibly happen.
573380	575620	And we'll talk about that in a future video as well
575620	577920	on the physics of free will coming soon.
577920	579100	So where are we?
579100	582260	We've ruled out a lot of inflationary models.
582260	585380	We would need to measure an inflationary gravitational
585380	587980	wave B mode signal that I've talked about
587980	590900	at length in other videos in order to conclusively
590900	593180	demonstrate the existence of these gravitational waves.
593180	595620	And that would be important because that would not only
595620	597860	help provide evidence for inflation
597860	600460	and maybe even narrow down even further
600460	602540	as much as humans could ever do narrowing down
602540	605300	the varying parameters that characterize
605300	606740	the inflationary universe.
606740	608740	It would also eliminate other contenders
608740	610500	for the cosmic genesis event.
610500	612060	In other words, it would eliminate things
612060	614820	like the bouncing model, the pyrotic model,
614820	617740	the conformal cyclic cosmology of Sir Roger Penrose,
617740	620380	the string gas cosmology of Robert Brandenburger
620380	622460	and Cameron Waffa that we'll talk about
622460	624220	in other videos on this channel.
624220	627860	So this non-detection is actually an important stepping stone
627860	630460	towards an ultimate measurement perhaps
630460	632660	of the cosmic genesis phenomenon
632660	634740	if indeed it did take place via inflation.
634740	637220	And if it didn't, we may see surprising results
637220	638380	along the way.
638380	640660	So these are really truly heroic results.
640660	643900	I'm happy for my former colleagues and friends
643900	645620	on the bicep experiment.
645620	646600	I wish them great success.
646600	649660	And of course with our small aperture telescopes
649660	652260	that we're building here at UC San Diego,
652260	654980	at Princeton University at UC Berkeley,
655020	657420	around the Simon's Observatory,
657420	659100	our small aperture telescopes,
659100	662120	these will hopefully set an important limit
662120	664600	or constraint or detection perhaps
664600	667140	of these primordial B mode polarization signals.
667140	670000	And I claim, this is my editorial opinion,
670000	674180	that one experiment cannot make a definitive claim anymore.
674180	678100	We will not be satisfied in this field of cosmology
678100	679720	unless two different experiments
679720	682020	can confirm the same type of signal.
682020	683580	They don't have to measure the exact same thing.
683580	685500	That's almost impossible in science.
685500	688260	They have to measure broad consistency
688260	690340	so that we can develop a consensus that inflation
690340	691180	took place.
691180	694380	If again, if indeed it did, who knows if it did.
694380	695700	But it's quite exciting to note
695700	699340	that no one can really go to the limits themselves.
699340	702460	No one goes to Stockholm themselves anymore.
702460	704780	We need to have confirmation if indeed this exists.
704780	707860	And I think that hopefully we will make great progress.
707860	710060	Again, as a scientist, you never wanna bias yourself
710060	711820	with the confirmation prejudice
711820	713140	that you are going to detect
713140	714460	that which you set out to detect
714460	716660	because it often leads you to reject things
716660	718620	that are perfectly acceptable
718620	721100	but just don't comport with your philosophical
721100	722780	or scientific worldview.
722780	724540	So for now, this exciting news
724540	728060	released from the BISEP team, the BISEP3 team
728060	730980	and eagerly awaiting new results
730980	733700	to come from this exciting field,
733700	735940	including results that will come from hopefully
735940	737280	right here at UC San Diego
737280	740460	and the Simons Observatory team around the world.
