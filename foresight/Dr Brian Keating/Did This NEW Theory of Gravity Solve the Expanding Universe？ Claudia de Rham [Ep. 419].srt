1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
What if there was an idea, a new theory of gravity that could bridge the gap between

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,680
our predictions and observations of the most mysterious substance in the universe,

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:10,560
dark energy?

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:15,680
Everything connects with gravity, everything lives in your spacetime.

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:20,560
Dark energy is a force that scientists believe is causing the expansion of the universe to

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,160
not only increase, but to do so at an accelerating rate.

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,080
But there are discrepancies between the predicted amounts of dark energy in the universe

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,200
and our theoretical calculations based on the properties of the fundamental particles

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,240
that we know and love.

10
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:39,440
We're trying to get to the bottom of this for years, almost 30 years without success.

11
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,080
That is, until today's guests, Professor Claudia Duran proposed a new theory of massive

12
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:49,920
gravity that could explain why the universe is accelerating and also solve the impossible

13
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,120
dark energy puzzle.

14
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,080
It's really in asking ourselves provocative questions just like you do that we make progress.

15
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:02,880
Join Claudia and me as we fall headfirst into the dark side of the universe to uncover

16
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:09,280
its most seemingly impossible mysteries and turn the impossible into the inevitable.

17
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:09,920
Let's go.

18
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,360
Claudia, how are you doing today?

19
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:12,880
Well, I'm great.

20
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,200
Thank you.

21
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,000
How are you, Brian?

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,400
I'm excellent now that I get a chance to talk to you.

23
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,840
We have a lot in common, but I'm going to start first with a rather provocative question.

24
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:28,640
If you'll indulge me, a lot of this book and a lot of your work corresponds to the desire to find

25
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,000
a solution to the so-called mass of the graviton.

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,080
I want to start by asking you, why should we care about finding the mass or attributing mass

27
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:44,640
to a particle whose existence we don't even know for sure about?

28
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,840
So that's many, many different reasons.

29
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,360
The first one, I would say, which is going to convince the few people, but is the truth,

30
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,560
is because we as human care about understanding nature at the most fundamental level, and so

31
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,400
we should really always dive deeper and deeper.

32
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,320
That's how we make progress.

33
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,400
Sometimes it's really in asking ourselves provocative questions just like you do that

34
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:16,160
we make progress and questions that may not have a specific outcome for tomorrow,

35
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,560
but it typically has shaped us, shaped the future of humanity.

36
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,200
That is really the real reason.

37
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,800
But then there's many other reasons I can tell you of why I went into that specific question.

38
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:35,520
First, let me just say that it's about understanding whether a fundamental particle,

39
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:43,200
which we may never detect per se, has a mass, but it has an implication also on gravitation

40
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:49,280
waves, which we do have, we have observed, and actually from the very first detection of

41
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:55,840
direct detection of gravitational waves here on Earth in 2015, the very one thing,

42
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,760
the first thing that they were able to do is put an upper limit on how massive the

43
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,320
graviton was because it has an effect on the propagation of gravitational waves.

44
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:12,480
So now that limit is still quite high as compared to what we ideally would like it to be,

45
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,520
for the reasons I'll explain.

46
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:20,800
But still, in principle, it has some real consequences that we can observe here on Earth

47
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,800
through gravitational waves and through many different tests of gravity,

48
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:30,640
tests of the universe, tests of why we're here, where we're going, our origin, and all of those

49
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,280
questions.

50
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:37,200
Why I am interested, why I spend my time looking at that as opposed to all sorts of other fundamental

51
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:44,560
questions, is because I think it has a potential to tackle the most challenging question of

52
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:50,000
fundamental physics, the biggest discrepancy of the whole history of science, which is

53
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,880
the cosmological constant problem.

54
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:59,920
Or in other words, why are we living in an universe that looks the way it does and is

55
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:07,040
not actually expanding at an accelerated rate, which is way faster by at least 56 orders of

56
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:14,560
magnitude, if not 120 orders of magnitude, as should be the case if the quantum fluctuations

57
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:20,720
from all the fields that we know exist, like the electrons and the Higgs and all of those fields,

58
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,280
all of those are the fundamental particles that made us so really exist.

59
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:32,400
We would expect them to lead to what we call an energy in the vacuum, an energy of nothingness

60
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:40,560
that fills the whole universe itself and should lead to a hugely faster accelerated

61
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,640
rate of expansion of the universe.

62
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:47,920
The discrepancy is simply the biggest discrepancy in the whole history of science.

63
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:54,560
And that is at the interface of the two pillars of modern theoretical physics,

64
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:01,280
modern science, which on one side is gravity, on the other side is field theory, quantum field

65
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,920
theory, putting the two together, which is really the foundation of the standard model

66
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,240
of particle physics as we know it today.

67
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,560
And so it's very much at the interface between the two of them that we have the biggest discrepancy

68
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,160
we can ever imagine.

69
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,760
And so it seems natural that the resolution is very much at the interface between the two

70
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,960
of them, thinking of gravity, thinking of gravity as well as a quantum field theory

71
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,760
and understanding what are the properties of gravity more fundamentally.

72
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:37,760
So recently, the DESI collaboration made an announcement that there seems to be evidence

73
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:43,680
for the variation of the cosmological constant from constant to perhaps a contestant-like

74
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,320
behavior.

75
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,280
Can you tell me how would that impact the statement you just made?

76
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:53,760
Would it affect the search or the motivation to look for a massive graviton?

77
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:59,840
So it is within the same framework that something has to be slightly different as compared to the

78
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:05,840
standard I'll call lambda CDM or vanilla model for the cosmological paradigm,

79
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:11,760
which we would just think until now everything seemed to fit beautifully with having called

80
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,440
dark matter and a simple cosmological constant.

81
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,400
So very natural in that evolution sense.

82
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:27,040
In a parameter sense, it's very simple in that sense, but actually in understanding how that

83
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:31,600
fits in in the bigger picture is that's where the real naturalist question is coming.

84
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:39,040
And so if there's any departure from this lambda CDM, it really opens up the opportunity

85
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:44,400
for there to be something else out there and any modification of gravity could feed into that,

86
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,280
any dynamical dark energy could feed into that.

87
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,800
And sometimes there's a little bit of a muchness on how much you consider

88
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,840
modified gravity and dark energy.

89
00:06:53,840 --> 00:07:00,720
You get some models of modification of gravity can be recaptured in effectively looking for

90
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,480
cosmological purposes as a dynamical cosmological constant or dynamical,

91
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,840
shouldn't say cosmological constant, but dynamical dark energy.

92
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:15,760
So for instance, if you have a theory of massive gravity and you want to tackle the

93
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:21,360
cosmological constant problem with that, you would want to accept that the universe is filled

94
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:27,200
with vacuum energy as expected from particle physics, but this huge level of vacuum energy

95
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:31,920
doesn't lead to a huge accelerated rate of the universe today.

96
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:37,840
It did in the past, but then through the weakening of gravity due to the mass of the

97
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,880
graviton, through the evolution of the universe, you would have a relaxation of the effect

98
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,880
of this vacuum energy on the evolution of the universe.

99
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:52,080
So in some sense, it does look like a dynamical or cosmological constant and that seems paradoxical,

100
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,360
but the source would be constant in some sense.

101
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,560
It would be vacuum energy, it would be a cosmological constant,

102
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,280
but then its effect on gravity, its effect on the evolution of the universe would be

103
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,840
dynamical, it would be deleted, relaxed our way through the evolution of the universe.

104
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:14,560
We would expect in this type of departure from the standard Lambda CD and the standard

105
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,840
cosmological constant. So some of your work in this book, which we will now play my favorite

106
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:25,920
game about called Judging Books by Their Cover, is about a topic near and dear to my heart,

107
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:31,200
the cosmic microwave background and the subject of polarization. But before we get there, I want

108
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,360
us to indulge ourselves in this game that I call Judging Books by Their Cover.

109
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,120
So Claudia, please, if you would, take us through the beautiful artwork,

110
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,240
the title and the subtitle of this wonderful book.

111
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:49,840
Okay. So the title is The Beauty of Falling and the subtitle A Life in Pursuit of Gravity.

112
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:54,160
And I'm really happy to guess what I mean by all of those things, which is a lot.

113
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,760
But I'm very happy with The Cover, actually, because it's very symbolic of the story.

114
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,240
There is a real story in the book. And so on The Cover, you start seeing on the top

115
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:11,760
an astronaut, an astronaut floating in mid-air, experiencing some level of free falling and

116
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:17,920
some freedom, very much some freedom in that. And then in the middle, you see the same person,

117
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:26,160
I think, Ali, each falling now. You can imagine she's falling. She's falling on earth. She's

118
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:31,760
really embracing some level of free fall. There's probably some friction from the air because she's

119
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:37,520
falling on earth, but she's enjoying it. There's a beauty in the fall itself. The fall itself is

120
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:45,040
beautiful. Maybe what comes next is what was a bit more worrying. But luckily for her, the last

121
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:51,680
picture, the bottom is her diving in the sea and really enjoying this last part of the free fall

122
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:58,320
and seeing how this channel, how this falling has been channeling through a different perspective,

123
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:05,040
now enjoying playing with gravity as she dives in the ocean and enjoying this new environment.

124
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,280
The subtitle is as beautiful. And of course, a lot of these things on The Cover that this

125
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:16,640
character is experiencing are relevant to you. The first one being astronaut, which you have

126
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:25,040
attempted to be from the European Space Agency sign. The middle one is you flying, maybe doing a

127
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,440
dive, but there's an airplane in the back. You and I are both pilots. I don't know how much you

128
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:38,080
fly nowadays, but I have flown a diamond katana before. Yeah, amazing. I know that. I have a

129
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:43,520
picture of it there. I'm not going to tell the screen right now, but it's a love that happened.

130
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:49,200
It just wants to fly. It's amazing. It just pulls the nose up and it wants to fly. It's incredible.

131
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,560
And then there's a woman ends up underwater wearing a scuba diving suit. And that takes

132
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:00,080
me to my first question from my guest, from a not a guest, an audience member who is a very

133
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:06,480
special person to both of us. His name is Professor Greg Gabadadze, who is not only a friend and a

134
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:12,720
brilliant scientist and innovator, truly just one of my heroes in science. He's also an administrator

135
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:19,440
at NYU, a dean. I don't know what masochistic desire he had to do that. He's from Georgia,

136
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,840
not the state, but the country of Georgia. So, you know, they make tough, tough people. They're

137
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:28,560
brilliant and tough. But Greg asked me to ask you when I solicited a question. He said, thanks

138
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,960
for reaching out. Claudia wrote a wonderful book with a clear and modern perspective on physics

139
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:36,720
and also connected to remarkable personal experiences. And I have a fun question for

140
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,200
Claudia. I'd ask her if there might be any advantage to thinking about physics while

141
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:48,160
floating in the cosmos or underwater. And I want to get your answer to that, Gregory's question.

142
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:54,480
In both ways, I think, being a theoretical physicist and thinking about quite abstract

143
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:01,280
concepts, I think there is a beauty in doing that when you fly, when you dive, you float in the

144
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:06,720
cosmos in embracing this understanding of nature at a deeper level. There is a deep connection that

145
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,680
gets there. But also the other way around, of course, I would like to tell you that I'm an

146
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:19,600
astronaut and I'm doing experiences about gravity in the microgravity on free fall

147
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,920
and orbit around the earth. It hasn't happened. And I'm not doing that when I'm scuba diving.

148
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:33,360
I'm not doing some explicit state of the art test of gravity when I do that. But I do it with my

149
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:43,600
body. And I think there is, as you say, Gregory is a very top guy. And I'm not saying that we

150
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:50,240
should all be very tough, but there is some level in which learning to have this balance between

151
00:12:50,880 --> 00:13:00,240
judging your instinct, judging your intuition in very challenging situations, but also seeing how

152
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:07,440
much you can judge intuition and how much you have to rely on your confidence to follow a pattern,

153
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:13,520
to follow the logic, to follow scientific rules in situations where actually your instinct

154
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,200
naively would tell you to do something which would be quite catastrophic. And you are kind of to

155
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:26,160
you know that, for instance, if you're flying and you're stalling, naturally, if you hadn't had any

156
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:31,280
training, the first thing you would try to do is pull the nose up because you say you're going down,

157
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:37,840
you're going to pull the nose up so that you pick up altitude. But actually that decreases the lift

158
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:45,200
and so the plane sinks much more and that can actually lead to an accident. So following too

159
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:54,240
much instinct in these situations can lead to catastrophic outcomes. So if you learn to put

160
00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:00,720
yourself in uncomfortable situations and have this balance between knowing what to do, there's a

161
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:07,360
level of instinct that you learn after having practiced it for hundreds of times, but also

162
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,720
is very much based on scientific understanding. You understand what you have to do logically,

163
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:20,240
that makes complete sense, and then you train yourself to learn the process in that. With your

164
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:26,000
body, a situation where your life depends on it, then you can do that on the blackboard so much

165
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,120
easier. Hey there, while Dark Energy is one of the most mysterious concepts in the known universe,

166
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,960
another mystery I'm trying to solve is why only 50% of you out there are subscribed to my YouTube

167
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:43,280
channel or following the podcast on your favorite podcast app. Are you one of them? Please don't

168
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:49,600
be in the silent majority. Do me a favor, subscribe, follow, and leave a comment or review. It really

169
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,920
helps me out and I respond to every single one. And when you do it, it helps me get great guests

170
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,720
like Claudia, Dan Dennett, Sam Harris. It's all a numbers game, unfortunately, and we have to make

171
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:04,320
sure the algorithm respects the matter that matters that we discussed on the Into the Impossible

172
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,960
podcast. So before we get back to the episode, just take a second and hit that subscribe button,

173
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:15,040
leave a comment or a thumbs up. Anything will help out. Appreciate it. Now back to the episode.

174
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,840
And that brings me to my next question, which is related to this gentleman who

175
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,960
features very prominently in this book, Albert Einstein.

176
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:30,640
Oh, you do? Okay, we can have a dueling one. So I'm going to do something mean to, which looks cruel,

177
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:36,000
but actually was one of his most exciting breakthroughs. In fact, he called this the

178
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,600
happiest thought of his life, which was that if he was following, he would experience no

179
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,960
gravitational force. And that led to the Einstein Equivalence Principle. And I want to ask this as

180
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:53,520
a first detour into your life as a professor and say that nowadays we hear a lot about artificial

181
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:58,480
intelligence and machine learning and all sorts of things. I think they're very powerful. But as a

182
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:04,240
professor, I think about, well, how could these things aid us? How could they be better researchers?

183
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:10,320
Could such an entity, artificial made of silicon and glass and steel and whatever else,

184
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:17,680
could it experience the joy of falling? Could it experience this most exhilarating feeling of Albert

185
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:23,920
Einstein? And then if it could experience that viscerally with a body, or if it could not rather

186
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,080
experience because it doesn't have a body, how could it make a breakthrough equivalent to what

187
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:33,600
Einstein, the greatest scientist of the last 100 years, perhaps, how could it even be considered

188
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:39,680
to be intelligent if it can't even do what Einstein did? I mean, it's a high bar. But do you think

189
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,400
that physicists can be replaced or mimicked even by artificial intelligence?

190
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:51,840
I think there's no replacement. I think we've done so well at using things to our advantage. And

191
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:57,040
there's clear advantages to using national learning. It can speed up a lot of the things.

192
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:04,080
Now, when it comes to can it feel for us? That's a deep question. I can't do. Do I really feel

193
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:09,440
something or am I in a matrix and believe that I feel something? And how will I know the difference?

194
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:17,520
I don't know. I think related to your question is also how we model the world all around us.

195
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,720
If a computer is able to model the world, the universe and nature all around itself to

196
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:30,640
incredible precision, does it make it that this model is the reality or not? And there's a thin

197
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:38,320
line there sometimes. So your question makes me reminded of that. If a computer can reproduce all

198
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:45,680
the signs of what it means to feel something, does it make it feel it or not? You'd think not

199
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:49,280
because we are experiencing something deeper than that. But how can you tell? I don't know.

200
00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:03,600
But I do think that there is a difference between spinning things up and reproducing,

201
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:09,120
relying on past understood patterns or past patterns that haven't necessarily been understood,

202
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:18,080
but have been identified and seeing them and being able to get some sense and logic and

203
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:24,880
organizing all of that, particularly when it comes to huge level of data, to speed up some

204
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:32,480
connection between some patterns and some model and some values that you want to take out of these

205
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,840
patterns or these data. There's a huge difference between doing that and actually coming up with a

206
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:44,720
breakthrough in itself, which requires a huge level of creativity. It's like all of a sudden

207
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:51,920
thinking you're going to paint the world, but not with pencils and paint, but using another dimension.

208
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:58,560
And it's something I can't even capture in words. And so if you haven't taught the machine

209
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:06,560
to think in that language, to use tools that will rely on the extra dimension, let me just

210
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:12,240
be crazy out there, how could it? I don't think you will out of the blue come up with things we

211
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:19,040
haven't ourselves yet invented with a completely new language. And so that level of creativity,

212
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:26,400
I think we will always have. And it's a little bit different. I should say that the response to

213
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,800
that, some people say that computers through machine learning, they can come up with new songs.

214
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:37,040
And so that shows some level of creativity. But those new songs are still within the same

215
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:43,600
remit of previous songs, still with music and notes, still within the same sense of that.

216
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:48,720
It will be quite different to have a sudden think of a new channel of communication, which is not

217
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:54,240
through sound, is not through light, is not even through gravitational waves. That would be something

218
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,360
yet completely different. And that's what we scientists are very good at, to think about

219
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:06,080
new ways to connect with the world. And in a 2020 paper published in PRD,

220
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:11,440
you described the speed of gravity. I always tell my students to their great horror,

221
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,880
the sun could disappear right now. And God forbid that happens, but we wouldn't know for eight minutes.

222
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,440
But is that really true? I mean, how do we know if that's actually true? So your paper,

223
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:28,560
the speed of gravity with Andrew Tolly at Imperial as well, makes a prediction that

224
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:36,560
the speed of gravity could differ from lowercase c. And I'm surprised. Why isn't this made a bigger

225
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:44,080
impact? Or are you even more famous than you are? You can imagine gravitational rain,

226
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:50,640
but it was where the speed of gravity does depend on the frequency, just like light

227
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:56,400
depends on the frequency. So not in the vacuum, not in empty space per se. For light, we can

228
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:03,680
understand. I can sort of conceive what empty space is, is the absence of interactions between light

229
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:11,600
and anything else. So we are used to the fact that light in space travels at the speed of light.

230
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:18,320
But if you shine light through water, for instance, then light will start interacting

231
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,960
slightly differently with the medium, with the water, with the water molecules,

232
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:29,520
depending on the frequency of light. And so you see that. And because of this interaction,

233
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:35,440
light doesn't travel at the speed of light in the vacuum in water, and the way it travels,

234
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,320
the speed at which it travels depends on its color. So we're all used to that phenomenon.

235
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:46,000
We all see rainbows, and that's the proof that light doesn't always travel at the speed of light.

236
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:52,480
So you can ask yourself the same question for gravity. And that's, you know, it's quite subtle

237
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:59,120
because now, what does it mean in empty space when actually everything connects with gravity?

238
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:04,960
Everything lives in your space time. And if a universe is filled with dark energy,

239
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:11,280
then is there such a thing as empty space? I don't know. And it could be that gravitational

240
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:18,400
waves do interact ever so slightly with anything living in that space time, including dark energy.

241
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,720
And if that were the case, then it would modify the speed of gravitational waves.

242
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:30,640
It would do so at very, very low frequencies. So if all of a sudden you were to take off the sun,

243
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:39,520
that would be kind of a high frequency, a high frequency thing. And so the propagation

244
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:44,720
of this information, well, you would expect it to take very close to eight minutes to reach to us

245
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,800
because at those frequencies, you would expect the speed of gravitational waves to be very,

246
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:56,080
very close to that of light. And another thing that would come concomitantly with such a phenomenon

247
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:03,520
would be additional polarization modes in addition to the so-called plus and cross modes that my

248
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,760
colleagues and I are trying to study in the cosmic microwave background.

249
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:12,480
Can you explain these types of new polarization states? There's a beautiful illustration in the

250
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,920
book about them, the so-called breathing one. That's very evocative. Can you explain what these

251
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:25,200
polarizations would do and why you manifest that you have to have new polarization states of gravity

252
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:31,760
if gravitational waves, or you call it glite, that will maybe catch on and supplement your salary

253
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:38,080
there. I hope so. I hope you get the trademark on that. But how would they manifest themselves?

254
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:42,320
How would a breathing mode manifest itself? And what would it look like in the power spectrum

255
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,720
of the CMB that my colleagues and I and the Simons Foundation have supported to the tune of over

256
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:54,000
$110 million so far? First of all, I think we will all sort of accept it that, for instance,

257
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,520
light itself comes in two polarizations and you put some very cool sunglasses and then you see

258
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:04,240
maybe one polarization and the other one gets filtered out. And we can ask the question already

259
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:09,360
for gravitational waves. Can you put some cool sunglasses for gravitational waves and only

260
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:15,600
you see one polarization or the other one? That would be a bit more challenging. But already,

261
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:21,040
yes, gravitational waves or what I like to call glite, because in some level it's quite similar

262
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:27,760
to light, comes already in two different flavors. And that's imposed by symmetry according to

263
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:34,800
Einstein's theory of general relativity. Now imagine that the gravitational waves

264
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:40,240
weren't traveling at the speed of light, very close to the speed of light, but not necessarily

265
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:46,800
weren't forced anymore to travel at the speed of light. Then you could, in principle, imagine some

266
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:52,720
sort of analog to sand waves, some longitudinal waves where you could have some gravitational

267
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,440
waves speeding up a little bit and slowing down a little bit. So these would be modes

268
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:02,640
which would not look like the standard gravitational waves, the cross and the plus,

269
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:07,360
which are transfers to the line of propagation of the gravitational waves.

270
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,520
They would actually be along the line of propagation of the gravitational waves.

271
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:18,560
So that mode, we typically don't like it, but that's a different story. It's just to illustrate

272
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:24,640
the fact that you open up a whole set of other possibilities once you allow yourself to sink

273
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:30,080
beyond the box, beyond not that I want to put Einstein's inner box, but beyond the theory of

274
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:35,520
Einstein's theory of general relativity. And so in addition to this longitudinal loads,

275
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:40,240
you also have some modes which are in between. So they are a little bit, they're halved through

276
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:46,640
the transverse direction and halved through the longitudinal direction. And also related to that,

277
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:52,640
you could have, you can now start imagining quite different things where rather than just have the

278
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,440
plus and the cross mode transfers to the propagation, you could have a breathing mode,

279
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:03,920
really just think about breathing. And if you think of some beads distributed along the circle,

280
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:12,400
as the mode, that mode goes through, they would sort of become, seem to suggest a bigger circle

281
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:18,080
and then come to a smaller circle and bigger circle and smaller circle. There's something quite

282
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:25,920
pacific about that. I like this picture, it makes me feel meditating as that mode goes through.

283
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:32,720
That mode is actually very important in any theory of gravity beyond Einstein's theory of

284
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:39,280
gravity, because that is typically expected to be the smoking gun signature for a theory beyond

285
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:46,160
Einstein's theory of general relativity. That mode, the real question is why isn't it there

286
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:50,240
in Einstein's theory of general relativity? You could expect it to be there in principle.

287
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:55,120
And it's not because of symmetry. Einstein's theory of general relativity was based on the

288
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:01,120
equivalence principle and on some other principles that nowadays we understand them as being

289
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:08,240
symmetry driven and that symmetry simply prevents this conformal breathing mode from appearing.

290
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:15,840
Now you can think if the graviton had a mass, you can always make that mass sufficiently small.

291
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:22,960
So that you don't see any departure. And that is true, that is true in principle. However,

292
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:30,640
because now there are additional polarization for gravitational waves, you can think about having

293
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:35,360
different ways to communicate through gravity. There's different channels of communication

294
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:42,000
through gravity. And that has a big impact in how we're testing gravity. As you say that would mean,

295
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,720
it could mean for instance that at the very beginning of the universe, you could have production

296
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:51,680
of not only primordial gravitational waves as the one you're thinking about,

297
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:58,480
which would lead to valorizations in the CMB. But you could also think of production of primordial

298
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:04,480
gravitational waves in this breathing mode. Now this breathing mode in itself, from a cosmological

299
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:10,240
perspective, it wouldn't be during inflation, it wouldn't necessarily look so dissimilar to the

300
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:16,880
inflaton itself or to the other field that are already present and whose effect has already been

301
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:23,920
seen and printed in the CMB through the temperature fluctuations. So actually, there are models out

302
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:30,960
there of massive gravity for the very beginning of the universe, where this additional polarization

303
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:38,560
of the gravitational waves do act potentially as a substitute for the inflaton. And for the

304
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:46,400
fluctuations in those, those primordial breathing mode polarizations would lead to the temperature

305
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,400
fluctuations that we do see in the in the cosmic microwave background, for instance.

306
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:58,320
So would there be a modification to the BB mode power spectrum, the autocorrelation, or would it

307
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:05,200
induce new forbidden correlations, EB correlations, would it change the shape of the autocorrelation?

308
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,960
Is there some way to detect it, you know, because these are the only, this is all you have, right?

309
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:14,080
You make the case in the, in the, in the book that beyond the, beyond the, you know, realm of the

310
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,880
galaxy or even clusters, there's no hope of discovering physics of gravity at the Planck scale,

311
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:24,400
other than inflation, if inflation did take place, we don't know that it did. Some of us hope that it

312
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:30,320
did, but we've had that, we've had that dream before. But the question is, are there new observable

313
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:35,200
signatures that we can use to detect the presence or absence of a massive graviton or and the

314
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,440
concomitant breathing modes that would also be induced in novel polarization states?

315
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:46,480
Yeah. So that's a great question. One of the things that would happen is if the, if the mass of

316
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:52,240
a graviton is a little bit too large, if you imagine you have a graviton being too massive,

317
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:58,560
then it would prevent the, prevent the production of primordial gravitational waves whose frequency

318
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:05,280
are comparable as the mass of the graviton during the, the period where they should have been produced.

319
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:10,720
So in effect, what you would expect in the power spectrum of primordial

320
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:17,120
polarization, or of primordial gravitational waves, let me say, of b-mode polarization,

321
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:24,080
you would expect a plateau. You wouldn't expect any production of primordial gravitational waves

322
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:31,120
at very low L because those would be forbidden by the, the fact that the, the graviton

323
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,680
prevents the production of primordial gravitational waves within that, those scales.

324
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:43,120
So seeing actually the production of primordial gravitational waves or CMB polarization, b-mode

325
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:49,680
spectrum at very low L, that would be assigned against massive gravity, against a massive

326
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:55,200
graviton, against massive polarizations during the period of concentration.

327
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,320
One thing that people don't talk about as much, I mean, people don't talk about this

328
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:04,400
massive gravitons very much either, but, but comparatively, even if you can imagine, even

329
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:09,760
less attention is paid to the existence of spin three halves particles. We have a spin zero

330
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:14,480
particles, we have abundance of those, we have a lot of spin one halves, thank God, or you and I

331
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:19,040
wouldn't be here talking, we have plenty of light, you know, with an L and no G in front of it,

332
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:24,160
we even have hopes of glite with spin, but the absent, you know, the, the so-called black sheep,

333
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:29,840
maybe the missing, you know, missing, missing term, missing spin statistic term,

334
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:35,120
it's been three halves. Why? What, what did nature do to so alienate one of the

335
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:40,320
most prominent types of fundamental intrinsic spin modes that could possibly exist?

336
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:44,880
Yeah, it's a good question. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I mean,

337
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:50,400
those particles, not at the fundamental level, but at composite level, they do, they do exist,

338
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:55,520
so we know they can't be represented to some level in nature, but having them as fundamental

339
00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:00,960
particle, we know that then their interactions with other fields is, is very difficult and

340
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:08,000
their implementation within a theory of gravity is also very, very challenging. I know that for

341
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:14,400
spin two, and it's the same case for, for spin three half as well, the, the framework in which

342
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:21,280
you construct the, even the, the nonlinearities, the interactions for spin up to, up to one

343
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:27,280
is relatively straightforward, I would say, and the connection with gravity as well,

344
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:32,160
and it's relatively straightforward, but when you go beyond that, it becomes extremely complicated,

345
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:38,400
and Annie, you have to be very subtle in how you try to connect those modes with others,

346
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:44,880
how they communicate with others. You very easily open new channels of instabilities,

347
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:50,320
so it's not typically, you can just add some level of interactions, and you're okay with that.

348
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:55,760
As soon as you open up a smallest level of interaction, you need to reinvent the wheel,

349
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:01,680
if so says reinvent a whole framework to see how they embed into a deeper, a deeper one.

350
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:05,520
So that we see from the theoretical perspective how challenging it is.

351
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:12,080
And so maybe, maybe because of everything that comes along with it, it's much harder

352
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:19,280
for them to manifest themselves in nature. Hey there, dark matter is mysterious, but

353
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:26,000
ordinary matter can be had in the form of a meteorite. If you just do me the favor of joining

361
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:09,840
Claudia D'Aram. Very interesting. I think another question that my listeners and viewers might have

362
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:15,280
is this concept of extra dimensions, which plays a big role in your research. Is there any

363
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:22,000
difference between when you speak about extra dimensions and when string theorists or fundamental

364
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:27,920
particle physicists speak about it? They both require or mandate the existence of these things,

365
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:32,720
which are as yet undetected, as you say in the book. So what is it? Are these extra dimensions

366
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,800
related to the extra dimensions of string theory? And if not, what are they?

367
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,320
The way I think about them doesn't preclude them from coming from string theory,

368
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:46,320
but actually the concept of extra dimension is a very, very old one. And within the framework

369
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:55,120
of general relativity, the same modern framework as in which we understand them today, they were

370
00:34:55,120 --> 00:35:01,760
already proposed by Kalutza and Klein very, very shortly after the proposal of general

371
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:07,840
relativity. They have very natural extension of general relativity. They have sort of taken

372
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:14,560
a comeback since string theory, because string theory needs them, was if you don't think of string

373
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:21,760
theory, you can ask yourself as to why we live in a world where there is three dimensional space

374
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:26,560
and one of time, you can ask yourself why is that the case, but you don't necessarily believe that

375
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:32,000
there needs to be an additional one, extra one. Whereas in string theory, there needs to be extra

376
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:38,960
one, there's no choice on the matter. And then they are typically expected to be confined around

377
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:45,200
themselves, compactified, very small, very, very small extra dimensions, or there could be some

378
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:53,040
larger ones. And there we would be confined on a membrane and a brain, deep brain in those extra

379
00:35:53,040 --> 00:36:00,640
dimensions. But a lot of my research in the way I've been thinking about it and looking at implications

380
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:07,200
for gravity and for cosmology, that was very much some of those ideas were motivated by string

381
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:13,360
theory. I don't necessarily need to have string theory to think about them. But a lot of them

382
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:19,680
nowadays, they are motivated again for one for another. In themselves, actually very natural.

383
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:24,720
One of the questions, I think to me, one of the most fundamental questions there is why

384
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:31,280
why three dimension and you mentioned Robert Brunnenberger earlier, he's one that he's an

385
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:36,160
incredible physicist, but he's one of the physicists that has come up with the most

386
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:44,080
ideas on why it is that we're experiencing three dimensions. Even in string theory,

387
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:52,560
we understand there are extra dimensions, but precisely what is the mechanism that led to us

388
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:59,200
living in a universe that experiences three dimensions is something quite challenging. And

389
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:04,560
it's not natural at all in string theory. It's very hard to make that work. There's no natural

390
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:14,800
process. He and collaborators of him, also, and Davis and with Dura have been people have been

391
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:24,080
exploring the idea of how dynamically you can have sort of a selection mechanism that either picks

392
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:29,920
out membranes in extra dimensions with which are three plus one dimensional. There's almost an

393
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:35,840
evolution selection mechanism where those are the ones we end up living in or some other types

394
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:42,000
of mechanisms in why the other dimension would be confined, compactified to be very small,

395
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:49,760
we only experience the ones we do. But even in both case scenarios assumes the existence of other

396
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:57,200
dimensions and that could have consequences on us. To see the consequences of that, typically,

397
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:02,880
you expect you have to go to very high energy scale to be able to probe those extra dimensions,

398
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:08,000
and that corresponds to going, again, back to the very early universe, again, to the type of

399
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,640
research that you're doing. And it is possible, and I would hope very much so, that it could be

400
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:18,800
imprints on the very early universe of those extra dimensions. And that could be imprints on the power

401
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:24,720
spectrum of the CMB and B mode polarization, possibly. That's for you to tell me, actually,

402
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:30,400
they can be in some other models of extra dimensions, they can be some effect, actually,

403
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:36,400
not at very high energy, but at very low energy, that things will look very similar to,

404
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,800
and will look four dimensional, three plus one, necessarily four dimensional, I mean,

405
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:46,880
three of space and one of time dimension for everyday life. But as you go to larger and

406
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:53,520
larger distances on the cosmological distances, then you're able to start probing the extra dimension.

407
00:38:53,520 --> 00:39:00,160
And that's why the universe, the evolution of the universe nowadays seems kind of counterintuitive,

408
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:06,640
and that's because we're starting possibly to probe the extra dimension, the extra dimension of space.

409
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:13,200
So it's sort of a relic or a shadow of the higher dimensions that we perceive in the pre-dimension?

410
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:18,000
Yeah, there's a lot of models out there where our cosmological evolution,

411
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:25,600
what we live as a universe is really, as you say, reminiscent of our shadow, a consequence of our

412
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:32,240
motion through time, yes, but really through the extra dimensional space. We are traveling through

413
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:37,520
this extra dimensional space, and that has an effect on our universe as a whole, with just a

414
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:42,960
consequence of that. A question I have for you, perhaps to elucidate, and I've asked it to many

415
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:48,720
scientists, but I never really get an answer that I can try. And I've asked even Roger Penrose,

416
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,720
in his multiple occasions of being on the podcast. And then you hope I have an answer.

417
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:00,640
I hear what he says, but I don't know if I understand what he says, although that might be

418
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:06,880
due to my failure to have consciousness, according to him. But my question for you is, first, do we

419
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:12,000
need a quantum theory of gravity? I mean, the only two scenarios where quantum gravity seems to

420
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:19,440
pertain in any kind of important, impactful, relevant role is not in our daily lives, but are

421
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:26,160
at the singularities of black holes, and perhaps the origin of time, if indeed time had an origin,

422
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:30,960
and many people don't believe that it did, or it was a classical bounce, or different cosmological

423
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:36,160
models, past guests, Paul Steinhart, Anna Aegis, Neil Turrock, many others, don't believe in the

424
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:41,760
singular quantum gravity necessity. So why do we need a theory of quantum gravity? If these

425
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:48,640
only two realms that we know about are shielded by event horizons, what's the point? We'll never

426
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:54,880
be able to witness this anyway. So actually, I am working on some understanding how to make that

427
00:40:54,880 --> 00:41:03,680
connection. So you probably want concretely to understand how to compute those things in situation

428
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:10,080
that we will likely never experience ourselves. That is true. But at the same time, we want to

429
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:14,960
understand why we live in the world we are living in. I think we all want to ask ourselves those

430
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:20,800
questions. It's all part of the origin. Why are we here? Why is life here? Why are universes here?

431
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:29,200
But even more fundamentally, why is representation of nature, representation of spacetime here,

432
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:36,560
and that the answer is, I think, seated in a theory, a more fundamental theory, a more fundamental

433
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:44,320
theory of something that unifies, again, not only the fundamental forces of nature, as we know them

434
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:51,280
with the weak and strong forces and electromagneticism, but also gravity and this unification

435
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:57,200
could have some consequences. What is our deep down origin in terms of what is the origin of

436
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:06,400
spacetime itself? I think we talked about that at the beginning already. Why are we pursuing

437
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:12,480
some such fundamental questions that we'll never be able to really experience the consequences of

438
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:20,720
that? History has told us that often we think that would be the case. We saw Einstein thought

439
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:27,840
that gravitational waves will never have any consequences to our life. No, no, no connections

440
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:34,560
to reality. We do use them now to communicate in some sense. Maybe communicate is a big word

441
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:40,800
because that incinerates a two-way communication, which is not the case so far, but we do communicate

442
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:47,520
with them with the universe. We use them as a new window, as a new way to see our universe,

443
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:53,200
see gravitational waves. That's an example where 100 years ago we thought there's never any use to

444
00:42:53,200 --> 00:43:01,440
it, and yet we're here. They are real. We have detected them. The fact that I can't tell you

445
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:09,120
right now whether we'll ever be able to experience a situation where quantum gravity is needed to

446
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:16,240
predict what happens precisely doesn't mean that there wouldn't be one, but who is to answer that

447
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:22,400
if we don't know what it is, we'll never be able to even answer that. I think we need to explore

448
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:28,000
beyond what we know to be able to see how much more there is out there and make sense of all

449
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,280
of those things. Let me go back to that point because we do say, for instance, I'm not a strength

450
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:38,320
theorist, so I can say that. I'm not a strength theorist. Nobody's perfect, Claudia. Nobody's

451
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:46,480
perfect. I'm not a strength theorist. I'm quite agnostic on whatever is going on at very high

452
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:51,600
energy, and some of my colleagues would not talk to me anymore for saying that. By the way, I have

453
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:56,880
to interrupt you and pardon my interruption, but part of the mission of this podcast is to educate

454
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:02,080
young scientists and how to be a good scientist. I just want to highlight what Claudia just said,

455
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:08,320
that it's her job, and my job as an experimentalist, her job as a theorist, to be agnostic. I was

456
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:13,520
asked by the New York Times recently, what do I hope for? What do I really want to find with the

457
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:19,920
Simon's Observatory? I said, our job is not to prove things. My job is to prove people like you

458
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:25,440
wrong, and your job is to keep refining what you know about the universe so that eventually I can't

459
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:30,560
prove you wrong, but that won't prove you right. What Claudia just did is incredibly important,

460
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:36,480
right? That's right. It's never about proving someone right or wrong in some sense. It's more

461
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:43,120
about deepening our understanding of nature. That's where we're going. This is why the book

462
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:48,640
is called The Beauty of Falling, because I will fall every day. I will come up with things which

463
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:53,040
are wrong every day. I will fall, and that is important. This is the way we make progress.

464
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,520
Right. At the end, you say, in fact, past these pictures that that is part of the beauty, is that

465
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:06,000
not just that you fall, and that that can be awesome, but part of the journey is

466
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:13,600
how you get back up, and how you respond to these challenges. I think, again, just for my young

467
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:18,560
students and postdocs and young faculty and old faculty who might need to learn this lesson,

468
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:24,320
the concept of quantum gravity is a beautiful one, because we have this innate need to

469
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:29,760
quantize everything we see. It's done so well, but the question I have even goes, you talk about

470
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:36,000
pie in the sky, and it reminded me of this past guest, Elon Musk, who I did talk to on the podcast

471
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:43,360
tangentially. You can find it on the videos and audio, but he once said the plank length sets

472
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:47,920
this fundamental limit beyond which we don't even need to know the digits of pie. In other words,

473
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:55,200
there's some minimum radius circle, which would be the plank length. I responded to him, he didn't

474
00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:01,040
write back, but that's sort of nonsensical. Nothing really happens at the plank length. Am

475
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:07,280
I wrong about that? It is a correspondence, a numerological coincidence, but nothing more,

476
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:12,640
or am I wrong? What we know is that there comes a point, it's not about a distance. It never was

477
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:19,920
about a distance in itself. It's about when the curvature, some measurable effect of the

478
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:26,080
curvature becomes big enough, and that is not so much about what distance you can measure, but

479
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:32,240
for instance, going within regions of space-time where you end up having, for instance, close to a

480
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:36,640
black hole or at the big bang, as you were mentioning, there will seem to suggest that the

481
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:43,840
curvature there becomes very large. So that a physical region where these things can happen,

482
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:52,400
but understanding how we transition from the semi-classical model of gravity through general

483
00:46:52,400 --> 00:47:00,560
relativity, which is embedded in an effective quantum field theory, how we transition between

484
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:08,320
that and something which takes over when this effective quantum field theory breaks down,

485
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:14,080
I think it is important to make communication between the two, and a lot of the work I do at

486
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:19,920
the moment, which is a lot of massive gravity, is to understand what are the key ingredients

487
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:28,160
that we have to keep beyond our understanding of reality, beyond general activity. You don't

488
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:32,640
even think of those concepts anymore. You don't think of space and time anymore,

489
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:38,960
but you think of probabilities, and you think of the notion of causality is extremely important,

490
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:48,720
and it's embedded not so much into return to the future kind of cartoon line, but it's encoded

491
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:55,360
in deep statements in how we can think of probabilities, and how we can think of also

492
00:47:55,360 --> 00:48:01,280
the notion of probabilities in a quantum sense, whether they respect some notion of

493
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:07,920
unitarity, where if you sum up the probabilities of a given outcome, whether they will sum up to one,

494
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:14,400
or whether they sum up to something imaginary or negative, which would make no sense.

495
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:21,520
And so these are very, very basic criteria that are satisfied by string theory, for instance,

496
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:26,800
and you like to ask yourself, without necessarily even relying on string theory, are those

497
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:35,440
concepts even correct? And is it okay for me to rely on them when all other notions of reality

498
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:45,920
have fallen apart? Is it okay for me to rely on those specific, just hang on onto them to see how

499
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:52,640
this very basic principle cascades that way down to something concrete at low energy,

500
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:59,200
and something which is consistent with what we observe? And we can actually make connections,

501
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:04,400
we can actually come, I can come up, I can give you a model today that seems completely

502
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:11,440
meaningful, I can come up with a model that can describe most of, or if not,

503
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:16,880
everything that I'd observed today. And then I know that if I were to go back up and make a

504
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:24,240
connection with how it will be realized at very, much more fundamentally, it will have to break

505
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:28,560
some of those assumptions. It will have to break some of this assumption of unitarity,

506
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:33,840
or causality, or some of the way I think about these much more basic amplitudes. And so I think

507
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:40,240
it is important in some sense to see what is it we're relying on at the end of the day? What are

508
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:50,000
we aiming for? And we know that the way we're going to end up describing things, nature, once we

509
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:55,360
no longer can rely on even the notion of space and time to describe them is going to be very

510
00:49:55,360 --> 00:50:00,800
challenging. We're going to need to invent new tools, new way to thinking to represent them.

511
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:05,600
And I don't even know precisely what is the right question for me to ask to even be able to

512
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:13,920
express that. But I want to hang on on very basic principles. And I think it is a meaningful

513
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:20,240
question for me to ask myself, are those okay to rely on? Because if they're not, then I have to

514
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:25,680
give up even more than that. Yeah. And I guess the question I keep coming back to is what would

515
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:36,320
constitute a detection of a quantum nature of gravity? And how could we do it? In the case,

516
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:40,080
we have to be open to the prospect that the Simons Observatory and every other observatory

517
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:44,800
may fail to detect gravitational waves and primordial nature. But that doesn't mean we

518
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:49,040
couldn't rule out quantum gravity. And when I go back in another way, in addition to Robert

519
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:54,080
Brandenberger, in addition to being pilots, in addition to, I'm not interested in scuba diving,

520
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:59,280
but we were both at Case Western, where the very first Michelson interferometer was done.

521
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:03,200
And I understand from your book that, you know, Michelson got into a little bit of a

522
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:09,200
palaver, as you Brits might say, you're not British. But the point being, they used a

523
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:13,520
Michelson interferometer, and now we have these LIGO machines. And my friend Eric Weinstein,

524
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:17,280
you know, came up with a beautiful thought experiment that I want to run by you as we

525
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:21,520
wrap up. Imagine the double slit experiment. The double slit experiment is the most quantum of

526
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:27,760
quantum mechanical experiments in terms of manifesting truly irreproducible quantum behavior.

527
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:31,200
Eric asked the question to me, and I couldn't answer it, so I'll ask it to you. Hopefully,

528
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:35,360
you can answer it. But if you had a double slit experiment, you know, the electron goes through,

529
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:39,280
you know, these, you know, goes through both slits, the wave function goes through both

530
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:45,200
slits in some sense. But, but in a classical sense, could you not use the gravitational effects

531
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:50,480
of the electron, just as a thought experiment? And could you not probe the use the gravitational

532
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:55,600
waves produced by this electron as it flies through, you know, presumably one of the two slits,

533
00:51:55,600 --> 00:52:01,120
at least in Einstein's conception. So could you use these interferometers, these Michelson

534
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:06,640
interferometers of LIGO, just as a thought experiment, to reveal which segment of the,

535
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:11,360
or which slit the electron went through, and therefore, you know, kind of simultaneously

536
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:14,400
be able to localize its position and momentum in a sense.

537
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,120
But from the gravitational waves produced by the electron itself?

538
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:23,520
Yeah, you use the gravitational waves to then measure the, the, which slit the electron went

539
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:31,680
through. Yeah. So you need to look at what is the magnitude of a gravitational wave the

540
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:35,760
the electron would produce. I'm not saying you could do it. Yeah, that was my thought too.

541
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:42,240
And that is very weak. That is going to be very, very weak in, in, in amplitude. And the issue

542
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:48,560
with that is that if you have a very weak gravitational wave that goes through, then in,

543
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:55,280
in the case of the interferometers here on earth, then they will move the position of the,

544
00:52:55,280 --> 00:53:02,240
the mirrors, which will be below Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Now I am a theorist,

545
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:07,200
so I have no problem saying and applying for funding to say, let's build an

546
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:12,960
interferometer, which is of the size of the universe. Let's do that. But even if you get the

547
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:22,640
funding, you know, you write the proposal then. So let's do that. I'll talk to Greg. You help me

548
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:34,560
sweet talk Greg. Okay. I'm going to be blacklisted. The issue is if you think, if you think about

549
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:42,320
the gravitational wave produced by an electron in that process, it's, it's way too weak to being able

550
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:49,040
to, to detect its effect. So but there are some experiments out there where I think one, one,

551
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:55,680
one of the experiments you should try to think about is having electrons absorbing a gravitational

552
00:53:55,680 --> 00:54:01,440
wave and a quantum of gravitational waves. So absorb a graviton. That's really what you

553
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:07,280
want to do to test the quantum nature of gravity in a way which would be very similar to that of

554
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:14,960
light. We know that electrons can absorb or emit unique quanta, discrete quanta of light

555
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:21,280
or photons. And as they do that as a change in energy level around the atoms. So you want to do

556
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:27,040
the same thing with gravitons. And in principle, that would happen. The probability would be very,

557
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:31,120
very small. But in principle, you can imagine that would happen. The issue is always

558
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:37,840
the reality of the world in which we live in. That's, it's just so sad because it's not the

559
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:43,040
process that is quite so, I mean, it is challenging in itself. It's not, it's not just that. It's the

560
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:48,720
fact that there's a lot of noise out there. There's a lot of other things that would that lead to

561
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:54,960
electrons changing energy levels, for instance. And so if you want to shield your whole experiment

562
00:54:54,960 --> 00:55:00,560
from light and the trainers and all sorts of other cosmic rays that would have the same effect on

563
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:07,200
your electrons, you're in trouble, but that it's the reality of life in which we, which we live in.

564
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:14,720
If we were living in a much simpler universe where there was no, nothing other than electrons and,

565
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:22,000
and, and gravitons and there was no cosmic rays and even light, or then it may be, it may have

566
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:29,200
been easier to abstract yourself from any other noise and prove maybe the quantum nature of gravity.

567
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:34,000
Well, I think that would be a wonderful place to wrap up. There's so many interesting things we could

568
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:40,080
explore in this wonderful new book. We'll have to do it perhaps in person someday. The beauty of

569
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:46,480
Falling is a beautiful book, A Life in Pursuit of Gravity, and it's endorsed by some of the

570
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:54,160
past guests on the podcast, including Sarah Seeger and Sean Carroll, both, both of them give it their

571
00:55:54,160 --> 00:56:01,360
most high encomium, as do I. Claudia de Rome, I hope you have a great deal of success with this

572
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:06,320
wonderful book. And I think your students are lucky to have you and your colleagues are lucky to have

573
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:12,400
you. And it's wonderful to have an iconoclastic thinker that, that does can, can, can, can operate

574
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:16,560
as you do in the mainstream. You can talk to string theorists. You can talk to

575
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:24,400
people that study loop quantum gravity or causal set theory. And you're not afraid to, to kind of

576
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:29,920
push back respectfully as, as I think is so refreshing. So this, this book is a wonderful

577
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:34,720
edition. It's incredibly readable. I listened to it. Princeton University sent me the audio copy as

578
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:40,880
well, which is not read by you, but, but is a delightful voice, whoever the, the narrator is. So

579
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:45,200
I cannot recommend this highly enough. Thank you. Thank you, Brian. It was so much fun to talk to you.

580
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:49,600
Thanks. Thanks. Hey there. I know if you watched all the way to the end, you're going to love this
