WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.520
The fear that comes out of whatever is left of the core community is you guys don't have a right

00:05.520 --> 00:11.920
to go direct to a consumer. You don't have a right to talk about the field. That belongs to a tiny

00:11.920 --> 00:16.720
number of people who do this morning, noon, and night who are all possessed of common beliefs.

00:16.720 --> 00:22.160
There have to be some standards. On the other hand, the core group that's been trying to gate this has failed.

00:22.160 --> 00:30.640
We have graciously been joined with two of the most prominent and two of my real heroes in this

00:30.640 --> 00:37.680
field that are maverick mathematicians who are self-made mathematicians in a way. And I want to

00:37.680 --> 00:44.720
talk about how they view the current spirit of the times as zeitgeist, as we say, in terms of

00:44.720 --> 00:51.280
theories of everything that are percolating around in the atmosphere. And to begin with,

00:51.280 --> 00:57.520
I'll ask my guest, Eric, to introduce yourself and say a little bit about where people can find

00:57.520 --> 01:02.160
you. We'll do that right up front. And then we'll get started with our discussion topics. We're

01:02.160 --> 01:05.440
going to have a nice clean fight. We're going toe to toe. No, there's not going to be any fight.

01:05.440 --> 01:11.120
It's going to be very, very respectful. So thank you both for joining. Eric, can you introduce

01:11.120 --> 01:16.160
yourself? And I'll buy me some time to tweet out this link. Check my feed. Eric Weinstein,

01:16.240 --> 01:23.120
I'm a managing director at Teal Capital. I come from a mathematics background. So I'm not a

01:23.120 --> 01:32.640
physicist. And I have an eclectic podcast called The Portal, which I hope to have. In fact, I've

01:32.640 --> 01:37.760
got agreements from both of these gentlemen to be my guests on The Portal. So I'm really looking

01:37.760 --> 01:43.600
forward to that and happy to help blow up into the impossible. Brian, you're doing a fantastic

01:43.600 --> 01:49.040
job. I love it. And it's all thanks to you guys. You guys were actually my first guest in what I

01:49.040 --> 01:55.520
call the pandemic podcast series, which began back in April, actually late March with Stephen.

01:56.080 --> 02:00.000
It was the first of the two of you to come on the podcast and really kicked off this whole idea

02:00.880 --> 02:07.040
of getting some of the world's most brilliant minds to engage around this topic of understanding

02:07.040 --> 02:12.080
the fundamental nature of the universe. And at that time, because of the pandemic, perhaps,

02:12.080 --> 02:18.400
Stephen's schedule was amenable to coming on my podcast. So we chatted for a mere three hours or

02:18.400 --> 02:23.440
so. And he's, as I said, gracious enough to come back. Stephen, where are you joining us from today?

02:23.440 --> 02:31.280
I'm in Concord, Massachusetts. And do I introduce myself? I'm Stephen Wolfram. I do science and

02:31.280 --> 02:37.120
technology and things I've built. Some technology things lots of people use. I've built some science

02:37.120 --> 02:44.560
lots of people use. And about 30 years ago, well, I used to be a particle physicist long ago.

02:45.200 --> 02:53.440
I did that when I was a kid. And then I got interested in computation and have kind of

02:53.440 --> 02:59.440
alternated between doing basic science and doing technology. And I've now done about five cycles

02:59.440 --> 03:04.960
of that. And I think it's a very interesting process, actually, alternating between basic

03:04.960 --> 03:09.360
science and technology, because they kind of build on each other. And it's sort of a

03:09.360 --> 03:16.960
progressively spiral upwards, so to speak. But the big surprise for me was about a bit more

03:16.960 --> 03:21.840
than a year ago now, a bunch of things that I've been thinking about, about how to make a fundamental

03:21.840 --> 03:28.880
theory of physics. I actually thought, I think I actually have some way forward. And a couple of

03:28.880 --> 03:33.360
young physicists were really enthusiastic about working with me on it. And so we're like, okay,

03:33.360 --> 03:39.520
let's try and really do something. And the huge surprise is that it's worked. And which I didn't

03:39.520 --> 03:46.640
expect. Yeah, I mean, it's, you know, we've been, we're at 100 years, roughly for, you know,

03:46.640 --> 03:51.520
general relativity and quantum mechanics, which are the two sort of big achievements of 20th

03:51.520 --> 03:58.800
century physics. And, you know, they've taken us a great distance. But, you know, I had a bunch

03:58.800 --> 04:03.120
of ideas that have been sort of based on things that came out of the whole computational thinking

04:03.120 --> 04:09.440
that I've done. And anyway, the big surprise that's worked, and not only that it seemed to have worked

04:09.440 --> 04:15.440
when I last talked to you, it's been going absolutely spectacularly since then. And it's,

04:15.440 --> 04:19.440
it's really, it's really, it's kind of like embarrassing, because there are a lot of things

04:19.440 --> 04:25.520
I should have been able to figure out 20, 30 years ago, which are now becoming obvious. And I think

04:25.520 --> 04:31.520
one of the other things to say is that one of the surprises to me is that I had thought we were

04:31.520 --> 04:37.040
building this kind of prong in the direction of kind of computation that would be really different

04:37.040 --> 04:41.600
from the mathematical physics and so on that people had done before. Turns out we basically

04:41.600 --> 04:46.480
built a sort of a low level machine code for how things work. But it turns out an awful lot of the

04:46.480 --> 04:54.160
formalisms that people have worked on in mathematical physics the last 50 years or so, they actually

04:54.160 --> 04:59.280
fit beautifully into the kinds of things that we're doing. And they seem to kind of illuminate

04:59.280 --> 05:04.480
what we've done and hopefully what we've done illuminates what they're doing. And I, I actually,

05:04.480 --> 05:09.760
my favorite analogy in recent times for this is what happened in early days of computation theory

05:10.400 --> 05:14.880
with things like Turing machines, which was that people had come up with, you know, models of

05:14.880 --> 05:20.160
computation, combinators, lambda calculus, general recursive functions, things like this.

05:20.160 --> 05:24.640
But it wasn't clear how they fit together. And they all seemed rather abstract. And people

05:24.640 --> 05:29.520
couldn't kind of tether them. And then Turing machines came along. And, you know, in the usual

05:29.520 --> 05:34.720
way that science history is done, we could say immediately everybody understood. But actually,

05:34.720 --> 05:40.000
it took, let's see how long, 40 years, 50 years. So immediately it was actually 40 or 50 years.

05:40.000 --> 05:45.920
But the people understood from from that kind of more concrete tethering of these ideas about

05:45.920 --> 05:50.240
computation, how all these different things fit together. So that's been, that's been, I mean,

05:50.240 --> 05:55.200
it's both both scientifically interesting to me. And I think also sociologically interesting,

05:55.200 --> 06:00.640
because often, you know, you come in with the big new theory, so to speak. And it's like,

06:01.680 --> 06:05.280
you're kind of gunning down everything else. But that's not what's happening here. I mean,

06:05.280 --> 06:09.120
what's happening here is that we've got something which is sort of orthogonal to what other people

06:09.120 --> 06:15.120
have thought about. It's kind of a low level, you know, low level machine code. And we can kind of,

06:15.680 --> 06:19.760
you know, see how things fit together at a higher level. That's your elevator pitch that goes to

06:19.760 --> 06:25.520
the space elevator stage docking station. Thank you, Steven. And both of you guys are notable,

06:25.520 --> 06:32.160
as people are pointing out in the chat, which I'm monitoring. So behave in there. I am seeing a lot

06:32.160 --> 06:36.000
of, you know, questions from younger people. And I think the two of you in particular,

06:36.000 --> 06:42.560
have an ability that other scientists have not yet really been able to achieve, which is to

06:42.560 --> 06:47.440
engage young people. And Steven, you just talked about engagement by these young physics students

06:47.440 --> 06:53.600
that we and I spoke about in our first conversation back in April. And with Eric, people are,

06:53.600 --> 06:58.960
you know, engaged on Discord, on comments, and people all over the Internet are really engaged

06:58.960 --> 07:04.160
with it. What do you think it does? You know, this podcast, the Intangible Podcast, I like to

07:04.160 --> 07:09.520
fashion myself as, you know, someday I'll be the Joe Rogan of physics. There's already one Joe Rogan.

07:09.520 --> 07:14.400
But I'd like to know, what is it about these theories of everything that really engages young

07:14.400 --> 07:19.040
people? And what I want to do is kind of translate. It's fascinating that you have this sort of bucket,

07:19.040 --> 07:26.160
theories of everything. I don't kind of view it as a bucket like that. For me, you know, I spent my

07:26.160 --> 07:32.000
life basically developing computation. And, you know, the fact that I happen to have discovered

07:32.000 --> 07:37.440
that that relates to kind of fundamental theory of physics is kind of a singular event, as far as

07:37.440 --> 07:44.320
I'm concerned. It's a kind of the bucket of theories of everything is not a bucket I particularly

07:44.400 --> 07:47.920
identify with. Right. If I could agree with Stephen, there can only be one.

07:47.920 --> 07:50.960
That was what I said today. There's a Highlander by Highlander.

07:50.960 --> 07:54.080
One of the surprising things that we've discovered is that really isn't true.

07:54.080 --> 07:56.880
There can be many ways of approaching that theory.

07:56.880 --> 08:01.440
Yes. But the thing that's interesting is that, you know, you could say there's only,

08:02.320 --> 08:06.400
fair enough, I mean, depends what you mean by only one. That's an interesting kind of ontological,

08:06.400 --> 08:10.800
epistemological question. But I mean, it's like, you know, you could say about computation. There

08:10.800 --> 08:14.880
could only be one theory of computation and it's Turing machines or it and its general recursive

08:14.880 --> 08:21.520
functions. The thing that's surprising about physics that has become increasingly clear is that

08:21.520 --> 08:26.960
the this kind of there's this notion of, you know, what are the possible, what are the underlying

08:26.960 --> 08:31.840
rules? And then how do we observe those underlying rules? And it's becoming clear that you can

08:31.840 --> 08:38.160
basically the only thing that is absolutely rigid is the underlying rules are computational

08:38.160 --> 08:43.760
and not hyper computational. That is, once you say that the underlying rules are purely

08:43.760 --> 08:51.120
computational, it then follows, it seems that the things we observe from 20th century physics

08:51.920 --> 08:58.880
are inevitable consequences of that and a few other kind of unspecific assumptions.

08:58.880 --> 09:04.080
It's a hard thing to explain. And actually, we're just, I think, okay, so here's a remarkable

09:04.080 --> 09:08.880
connection that's just been becoming clear. So we have this notion of, you know, you have some

09:08.880 --> 09:15.200
underlying rules, you follow these rules, you, you know, reproduce how the universe works.

09:15.200 --> 09:22.400
But on the other side of that, we are observing how these rules are working and interpreting them

09:22.400 --> 09:30.800
to say this is how the universe works. The thing that is surprising is that one can, I mean, in

09:30.800 --> 09:35.040
the language of our kind of theory, there's this thing called the rural multiway system,

09:35.040 --> 09:41.040
which is this kind of this branching system that's that runs sort of all possible rules.

09:41.040 --> 09:45.520
And this is we're now jumping into the most abstract, most, most complicated. But I just

09:45.520 --> 09:49.840
want to say one thing about it, which is kind of kind of interesting, which is it's turning out

09:49.840 --> 09:54.800
that this incredibly abstract thing that we have this rural multiway system, appears to be the

09:54.800 --> 09:59.920
same as this thing called the infinity groupoid, which was developed by growth and deek. And

09:59.920 --> 10:06.560
when it was at the 70s, I guess, 1970s, which is kind of a pinnacle of abstraction of category

10:06.560 --> 10:11.600
theory in other areas of mathematics. And what is really quite remarkable to me is that it seems

10:11.600 --> 10:16.720
like this thing that's coming out of our theory kind of maps into this incredibly abstract

10:16.720 --> 10:24.240
mathematical thing. And the observations that we have of the universe correspond to a particular,

10:24.240 --> 10:32.000
in mathematical terms, kind of vibration of this infinity groupoid thing. And that basically what

10:32.000 --> 10:39.680
we're our our way of interpreting the universe is kind of a slice of that of that mathematical

10:39.680 --> 10:46.960
object. And so it's the statement, there's only one theory, in a sense, all these theories are

10:46.960 --> 10:53.280
equivalent. But the, you know, the question is how how we are observing them. I was making a

10:53.280 --> 10:58.960
pop culture reference. The intellectual spirit of it is that you can have a summit and there are

10:58.960 --> 11:06.320
many faces that could be used as assaults on that summit. In the end, however we traverse,

11:06.320 --> 11:12.640
you know, Einstein, for example, came up with his divergence free equations after some rumbling

11:12.640 --> 11:17.840
around in differential geometry, Hilbert went, you know, immediately to a Lagrangian description,

11:17.840 --> 11:23.600
they were describing something in common. So I didn't mean to suggest that there was a single

11:23.600 --> 11:31.200
description, but there can really only be one underlying theory. And we all of us who are,

11:31.200 --> 11:36.960
I was trying to agree with you, Steven, that the most probable number for wrong guests on this

11:36.960 --> 11:44.480
live stream is two. But in all probability, if it is not two, then one of us is wrong. It strikes me

11:44.480 --> 11:49.360
that you have gained confidence that what you are doing is actually not only capable

11:50.080 --> 11:55.600
of producing a fundamental final theory. And we can talk about what the right language is,

11:55.600 --> 12:00.560
I'm not wedded to any particular description, if you have an objection. But it sounds to me like

12:00.560 --> 12:09.040
you are increasingly convinced that week by week, this is really the most promising assault

12:09.040 --> 12:16.400
on our foundations. First of all, if I'm wrong, I hope that you or Garrett Leasy or one of these

12:16.400 --> 12:21.040
other crazy people turns out to be right. It would be a pleasure to lose to you, sir.

12:21.040 --> 12:28.640
The thing to understand is the kind of system that we've built, it is very likely that, you know,

12:28.640 --> 12:32.080
I don't understand what you've done, but you know, I know a little bit of the mathematical

12:32.080 --> 12:37.600
background, you know, the whole, for example, understanding local gauge invariance and understanding

12:37.680 --> 12:43.040
how fiber bundles work in our systems, as a student actually at our recent summer school,

12:43.040 --> 12:48.320
mathematical physicist, who managed to make great progress on that. And it's actually very clever

12:48.320 --> 12:54.240
and much simpler than I expected. The way that essentially sort of fiber bundle type structures

12:54.240 --> 13:00.480
and local gauge invariance arise in our theories. Now, what you do with it once it's arisen from

13:00.480 --> 13:05.840
this kind of low level machine code, that's, you know, often running with much more traditional

13:05.920 --> 13:10.480
mathematical physics. And I don't think that there's a, you know, it's not an incompatible thing to

13:10.480 --> 13:16.160
say, oh, there's some complicated structure to do with, you know, high dimensional systems and

13:16.160 --> 13:21.200
fiber bundles and so on. That doesn't, that's not like, there's no, there's no divide yet.

13:21.200 --> 13:27.920
Let's try to state how you and I could both be fit into the discussion that Brian is trying to

13:27.920 --> 13:34.400
conduct. One thing I definitely agree that, you know, conciliance is nice and it's wonderful to

13:34.400 --> 13:39.760
have consonants what the viewers want as argumentation. I'm just kidding. I don't care about that,

13:39.760 --> 13:44.960
but when I do, she gets Sabina back on. Exactly. I think it would be really a great outcome of this

13:44.960 --> 13:50.000
discussion would be kind of the joining of your two different, different approaches. I don't know

13:50.000 --> 13:54.160
about Eric's stuff. So I can't really comment on that. The people out in that are watching that

13:54.160 --> 14:00.400
have, as you just said, fiber bundles, hop vibration, gauge invariance, but way of having

14:00.400 --> 14:05.040
sort of a Rosetta Stone. If there are people out there, I'm not asking or asking you guys,

14:05.040 --> 14:11.520
God forbid, with homework, but people in the respective domain experts in both of your two

14:11.520 --> 14:15.840
categories, I think that would be an interesting kind of project to see. Can these be reconciled?

14:15.840 --> 14:19.600
So maybe I should explain what we're doing. Okay, because there's a fairly large effort at this

14:19.600 --> 14:24.480
point. What's been happening, you talk about engaging young people, you know, what I've been

14:24.480 --> 14:28.320
trying to figure out how to do this, because there's been a lot of enthusiasm for our project,

14:28.320 --> 14:33.040
a lot of people interested, a lot of people say, I want to contribute to this project. Okay.

14:33.040 --> 14:39.440
So right now we have, we're just about to kind of roll out, I think we have 30 research affiliates

14:39.440 --> 14:44.080
and junior research affiliates who are mostly people who came to the summer school that we just

14:44.080 --> 14:50.080
spent a month having. And they're people who are sort of in motion, sort of doing research

14:50.080 --> 14:55.040
along the lines of this project and, you know, producing papers and so on. And, you know, one

14:55.040 --> 14:59.440
of the important objectives there, there's several important objectives, but one of them is

14:59.440 --> 15:06.240
making these bridges to other kind of mathematical physics approaches. Another thing is just being

15:06.240 --> 15:11.120
able to check off the list. There are, you know, these effects known in quantum mechanics, there

15:11.120 --> 15:17.280
are these features of general activity, for example, can we go down the list and say, okay, you know,

15:17.280 --> 15:22.640
we have destructive interference, we have spin statistics connections, we have this, we have

15:22.640 --> 15:27.280
that. The thing that's just absolutely amazing is every time I think one of these is going to be

15:27.280 --> 15:32.320
really hard, it turns out to be much easier than I think. And that's been a big surprise to me. I

15:32.320 --> 15:39.440
mean, I've been, my expectations keep on being kind of exceeded. And I think that the, I mean,

15:39.440 --> 15:43.680
the other question is, for example, for something like general activity, which I know, you know,

15:43.680 --> 15:49.680
you have a lovely cosmic microwave background globe and the back there, it's some right,

15:50.400 --> 15:54.880
it's very cool. Yeah, it's weird that it's kind of the inversion of the sky, so to speak.

15:54.880 --> 16:00.480
Yeah, God's I view, right. Yeah, right. You know, so for example, there's the, you know,

16:00.480 --> 16:06.480
we have a sort of mathematical proof that in some limit, we can reproduce general activity.

16:06.480 --> 16:12.080
But the question is, can you actualize that? And so here's an interesting example of how sort of,

16:12.640 --> 16:17.040
you know, a direction we're going in, which is an interesting sort of way to validate theories,

16:17.040 --> 16:22.240
the following thing. So when people normally study gravitation theory, they say, oh, we've

16:22.240 --> 16:27.680
got Einstein's equations from 1915, they work great. But if we actually want to find out her

16:27.680 --> 16:33.120
two black holes merge, we don't get to kind of work out, you know, with Mathematica or something,

16:33.120 --> 16:38.160
the exact, you know, result for, you know, how this black hole merger will work, we have to

16:38.160 --> 16:42.720
make numerical approximations to the Einstein equations, sort of break them down into something

16:42.720 --> 16:49.520
discreet, solve them on a computer, see what the implications for this process are. But that,

16:49.520 --> 16:54.080
that kind of break down the Einstein equations into something discreet that can be solved on a

16:54.080 --> 16:58.720
computer, there's an alternative way to think about that, which is start from our theory,

16:58.720 --> 17:05.040
which is born as something that you can run on a computer, and then go up from there to get to

17:05.040 --> 17:09.120
something which can reproduce what happens in black holes and so on. And so, you know,

17:09.120 --> 17:13.280
this is the kind of thing I happened to do this years ago with fluid dynamics,

17:13.280 --> 17:18.080
where you can start with these very simple, in that case cellular automaton models of fluid dynamics

17:18.080 --> 17:22.320
and build up from those to actually reproduce fluid phenomena. But anyway, so the thing is

17:22.320 --> 17:27.040
what I might call proof by compilation, so to speak, which is you're going from the kind of

17:27.040 --> 17:33.040
low level structure of the model to actually do computations that can then be compared with

17:33.040 --> 17:36.960
black hole dynamics, even though you sort of know it has to work, because you have a mathematical

17:36.960 --> 17:41.120
proof that the two things are equivalent. But it's very satisfying to see it actually work,

17:41.120 --> 17:45.920
it hasn't, we haven't, you know, done that yet, but we're in the process of doing it.

17:46.480 --> 17:50.320
And more interestingly, actually in quantum field theory, where numerical methods have been much

17:50.320 --> 17:55.600
harder to apply, it looks like we have a pretty good way to do sort of numerical quantum field

17:55.600 --> 18:00.480
theory in a different way than it's been done before. When you say it's easy, by what metric

18:00.480 --> 18:07.200
or what measure function are you defining that? Easy in terms of, you know, just easy for a brilliant,

18:07.200 --> 18:13.360
you know, grandmaster of physics to unravel, or easy in terms of computational efficiency in some

18:13.360 --> 18:18.160
sense? No, I mean, for example, one of the things is, do we have to know how electrons work to be

18:18.160 --> 18:23.280
able to, or do we have to know what photons in detail are before we can reproduce effects in

18:23.280 --> 18:29.440
quantum mechanics? The answer is, a lot of these phenomena seem to be more generic than I expected

18:29.440 --> 18:37.920
and more amenable to being kind of explained without having that whole tower of features built.

18:37.920 --> 18:44.560
So that's the main thing I mean by easier. I think in terms of the technical difficulty

18:44.560 --> 18:49.040
and the mathematical depth of what's going on, we're doing what physicists often do, which is

18:49.040 --> 18:54.080
we're skating over many of the mathematical difficulties. I mean, in some of these derivations,

18:54.080 --> 18:58.880
there are like 12 different limits that have to be taken of, you know, this thing is small

18:58.880 --> 19:02.640
compared to the size of the universe, but large compared to this, but small compared to the curvature

19:02.640 --> 19:07.840
of that, but large compared to this and so on. And, you know, each one of those limits is a

19:07.840 --> 19:13.360
significant amount of mathematical work to validate and so on. And, you know, this is the

19:13.360 --> 19:17.920
typical thing that's been done by physicists through the ages, I'm afraid, that just skate

19:17.920 --> 19:22.160
right over those things. Now, we have a big advantage, which was you can do computer experiments. So

19:22.160 --> 19:25.760
we kind of know it's going to work. I mean, we know we're not going to be too far off because

19:25.760 --> 19:30.800
we can actually check a bunch of these things in actual experiments. Although the experiments we do,

19:30.800 --> 19:34.560
you know, if the universe has 10 to the 400, you know, atoms of space in it,

19:35.120 --> 19:39.280
we certainly don't have that many in our computer. So we're doing very small versions of this.

19:39.280 --> 19:43.600
You know, I want to say that I think it might be interesting for us to talk a little bit about

19:43.600 --> 19:48.960
kind of the more sort of societal and structural aspects rather than getting too deep into the

19:48.960 --> 19:54.400
into the. Sure. Wait a minute. I was looking to get, I wanted to get into the into the damn weeds.

19:54.480 --> 19:58.080
Go for it. We will. We will. But yeah, small, small amount of weed,

19:58.880 --> 20:03.360
weed whacking. And then then we can talk about some the bigger picture of science and the world

20:03.360 --> 20:08.240
and so on, which I think I think we probably both have things to say about. I think that segues

20:08.240 --> 20:13.760
nicely into a question that I brought up with with both of you separately and then earlier

20:13.760 --> 20:19.840
today. And that's kind of the structure of the way that scientific revolutions take place. And

20:19.840 --> 20:25.120
it's become a trope, you know, nowadays to say there's a paradigm shift, which is brought upon

20:25.120 --> 20:30.880
by some new idea, radical, usually some lone genius like you guys working almost in solitude.

20:30.880 --> 20:34.720
I'm just teasing, but just going to get us into trouble with Reddit. That's all you're doing.

20:34.720 --> 20:39.680
You're just bathing Reddit. Well, hopefully Dr. Reddit is not watching yet. I guarantee she is.

20:39.680 --> 20:44.000
What do you think about this notion of paradigm shifts? Do you think it's really the way that

20:44.000 --> 20:50.000
science takes place? Or is it just sort of a retro retrospective, retradiction, historical

20:50.000 --> 20:55.040
narrative of what has taken place that is just convenient as a hack for the human mind to say,

20:55.040 --> 21:00.160
okay, in retrospect, the paradigm shifted with Galileo's observation of the Jovian satellites.

21:00.160 --> 21:05.280
What do you, Eric, think about this notion of CUNY and paradigm shifting? You have to

21:05.920 --> 21:11.600
have lived through stasis and stagnation and through revolution and boom.

21:12.560 --> 21:18.000
And even if the boom isn't the largest boom on record, like, you know, the Gold Rush or something,

21:18.000 --> 21:23.920
in science, I lived through one or two revolutions, one of which was a Rosetta Stone between

21:23.920 --> 21:30.160
differential geometry and quantum field theory, or at least the structure underneath quantum field

21:30.160 --> 21:35.280
theory that was figured out in the mid 1970s. It doesn't have a historical, like you can't go to a

21:35.360 --> 21:44.080
biopic about it, which is weird. But your friend Jim Simons, Brian, and C. N. Yang, arguably,

21:44.080 --> 21:50.320
maybe the greatest of living physicists, figured this out over lunch. And that revolution is going

21:50.320 --> 21:55.360
on to this day called the Wu Yang Dictionary. There was another one having to do with the

21:55.360 --> 22:00.880
discovery that quantum field theory was a mathematically natural structure, not just a

22:00.880 --> 22:06.000
grab bag of techniques, and that it would have been discovered as an enhancement of something

22:06.000 --> 22:12.000
in algebraic topology, since Dr. Wolfram brings up Alexander growth and deke. In algebraic topology,

22:12.000 --> 22:16.960
we have a theory called boredism, which is an extraordinary homology theory, and quantum field

22:16.960 --> 22:24.160
theory would be discovered in enhancing boredism theory, as Ed Whitten, Michael Atiyah, and Graham

22:24.160 --> 22:29.760
Siegel and others taught us in the 1980s. Having seen revolutions, yes, there are things that you

22:29.760 --> 22:37.040
can tell people where they're never the same again. They come to understand, as I've said before,

22:37.040 --> 22:42.640
there should be a tattoo on all of our cecums. If you can read this, you're too close. When you

22:42.640 --> 22:50.000
pull your head out, you can better understand the world after the revolution. And what Dr.

22:50.000 --> 22:57.360
Wolfram is discussing is that we've had a small number of complete revolutions in our thinking,

22:57.360 --> 23:03.360
and many more minor elaborations in our thinking. There was one around scale, which might be called

23:03.360 --> 23:09.280
the first and second renormalization revolutions, originally a Feynman and Schwinger, but then

23:09.280 --> 23:14.560
Ken Wilson really was probably the big name in that area. Having been through a few of these

23:14.560 --> 23:19.520
revolutions, having been close enough to study them, and also in a few different fields like

23:19.520 --> 23:24.800
biology with, you know, CRISPR-Cas9 or optogenetics or something like this, yeah, no, these things

23:24.800 --> 23:32.080
are real. And they change everything. And, you know, my resistance to Stephen's theory will one day

23:32.080 --> 23:36.720
turn into, you know, my saying, oh, my God, I can't believe I didn't understand what you were

23:36.720 --> 23:42.320
saying. It was too new to use Feynman's famous quote from when he tried to introduce his path

23:42.320 --> 23:47.440
integral or path sum over history's approach. He said, my machines came from too far away,

23:47.440 --> 23:51.520
because he was derided. And you see a lot of people, we were talking before about Reddit,

23:51.520 --> 23:55.840
just to close this out. A lot of people are trying to figure out what the hell is going on in these

23:55.840 --> 24:00.240
live streams, and why does one person get to be in them, and who's a crank, and who isn't.

24:00.240 --> 24:05.200
They're trying to use some sort of indicia, which is, does that person sound like their wild eye?

24:05.200 --> 24:09.760
Does that person sound sober? And it's a really odd moment, because on the one hand,

24:09.760 --> 24:14.880
everybody sounds crazy, and some of the crazy people sound among the most sane. And I think Dr.

24:14.880 --> 24:19.760
Wolfern, for example, despite the fact that I think he's wrong, I think that he is one of the

24:19.760 --> 24:25.360
sanest voices out here, one of the most interesting for sure. And part of the problem is the mainstream

24:25.360 --> 24:30.560
of the community sounds mad as a hatter to me, and Dr. Wolfern sounds much more reasonable.

24:30.560 --> 24:35.840
So let's comment on paradigm shifts and so on. I've been fortunate to live through some myself,

24:35.840 --> 24:40.320
even probably responsible for some. The main process that seems to happen is,

24:40.880 --> 24:46.720
a methodological advance is made, that opens up some new area, there's a bunch of low hanging

24:46.800 --> 24:51.040
fruit to be picked in that area. Lots of exciting stuff happens for five years,

24:51.040 --> 24:57.840
10 years, maybe a little bit longer. That area of science gets big, it gets quite institutionalized,

24:57.840 --> 25:03.200
it slows down, there's 50 or 100 years of sort of stasis, and then maybe there's some methodological

25:03.200 --> 25:09.520
advance and it opens up again. And typically, in terms of sort of the conceptualization of

25:09.520 --> 25:15.520
these methodological advances, it's usually a long process for the people involved in them,

25:15.520 --> 25:19.600
and it's usually, you know, you have to sort of think about things in the right way,

25:19.600 --> 25:24.160
and then maybe there's some moment when you realize, yes, I can actually see how this works. Now,

25:24.160 --> 25:29.360
for example, in my current activities in physics, you know, one of the embarrassments of that is

25:29.360 --> 25:34.720
that the fundamental model, which is based on, you can think of it as based on rewritings of

25:34.720 --> 25:42.800
hypergraphs or very minimalist, very sort of abstract thing about transformations for relations

25:42.800 --> 25:50.160
between elements. And that idea you can also think of as transformation rules for symbolic

25:50.160 --> 25:55.360
expressions. Well, the idea of transformation rules for symbolic expressions is what I've been

25:55.360 --> 26:01.920
using technologically in building computational languages for 40 years. And it is super embarrassing,

26:01.920 --> 26:07.760
in a sense, that the core idea, which seems to have unlocked what we're doing now in physics,

26:07.760 --> 26:12.000
is actually something that I've been working on for 40 years. But I didn't see that connection,

26:12.080 --> 26:18.080
I mean, what's happened is that normally, in using symbolic expressions and transformation

26:18.080 --> 26:22.160
rules for symbolic expressions in computational languages, those symbolic expressions actually

26:22.160 --> 26:28.800
immediately mean something. They mean, you know, adding things together, they mean, I don't know,

26:28.800 --> 26:34.960
some other identifiable kind of operation. Whereas in the way we're using them in physics,

26:34.960 --> 26:39.840
it's just the infrastructure, they mean nothing. They get meaning because the things in them turn

26:39.840 --> 26:45.360
into the things like the atoms of space and so on. But to begin with, they mean nothing. So for me,

26:45.360 --> 26:49.840
that's sort of an interesting case, because it's something which has been right under my nose for

26:49.840 --> 26:55.920
40 years. And it took that amount of time for me to have the right sort of conceptual framework

26:55.920 --> 27:01.200
to see how it could be applied in this particular case. And, you know, I think that's, I mean,

27:01.200 --> 27:07.120
this is a question of kind of how people, you know, how these paradigm shifts and so on,

27:07.200 --> 27:12.720
kind of land in the world. I mean, okay, so there's one big one that I've been deeply involved in,

27:12.720 --> 27:19.360
which is the whole idea of using computation and programs as models of the world, instead of using

27:19.360 --> 27:24.880
mathematical equations as models of the world. So you roll the clock back, you know, 300 or so

27:24.880 --> 27:31.200
years, we get to Galileo and Newton and so on. And they had the problem of explaining to people,

27:31.200 --> 27:36.080
no, you can't just reason about how the world works, you can write down a mathematical equation

27:36.080 --> 27:41.840
and solve it and that will tell you how the moon moves or something. And, you know, at that time,

27:42.880 --> 27:47.360
it was a sort of complicated battle to have people realize, yes, you can just, you know,

27:47.360 --> 27:50.960
solve the mathematical equation, it will tell you how the world works. It's not a question of

27:50.960 --> 27:56.960
reasoning about it. Okay, 300 years go by. And then we're at the point where, oh, mathematical

27:56.960 --> 28:01.280
equations are the way the world works. Is there some other way to describe how the world works?

28:01.280 --> 28:05.200
No, no, no, they can't possibly be another way to describe how the world works. You know,

28:05.280 --> 28:10.800
when I started thinking about kind of generalizing sort of rules for how the world works and

28:10.800 --> 28:14.800
thinking about simple programs and what they do and kind of exploring the computational

28:14.800 --> 28:18.240
universe of simple programs, I would say, actually, looking back on it's interesting,

28:18.240 --> 28:23.520
you know, I published this big book called a new kind of science back in 2002. I would say that

28:23.520 --> 28:28.720
many fields were really quite receptive to what I had to say. Fundamental physics was actually one

28:28.720 --> 28:33.200
of the one of the only exceptions. What was interesting there was, you know, some people said,

28:33.200 --> 28:36.800
oh, you know, programs, we don't need programs to describe the world, mathematical equations

28:36.800 --> 28:43.200
do just fine. Okay, now you look just maybe 15 years later. And if you look at new models that

28:43.200 --> 28:48.000
people are inventing of things, they are overwhelmingly based on programs, not based on

28:48.000 --> 28:52.800
mathematical equations. There's a dark story underneath this, which is that as tech has been

28:52.800 --> 28:58.000
really the, and by tech, I really mean computation, because most of the rest of technology seems to

28:58.000 --> 29:04.560
have vanished as computation became the one bright spot in a relatively stagnant world.

29:05.440 --> 29:10.320
And I hate to say it that way. There are caveats, but let's let's keep going.

29:11.680 --> 29:18.160
It came to be that many people started to dress up whatever they were doing in terms of computation,

29:18.880 --> 29:24.160
right, because it was possible to seek, you know, funding from a Yuri Milner or a Mark Zuckerberg,

29:24.160 --> 29:28.160
or, dare I say, a Jeffrey Epstein, you know, all of these sorts of things,

29:29.360 --> 29:36.000
which had exotic funding sources or possible prizes around them in computation. It also

29:36.000 --> 29:40.960
became the case that funders were more eager at the government level to hear a proposal for

29:40.960 --> 29:46.240
something having a computational nature. So the problem that we have is, is that there were all

29:46.240 --> 29:53.440
of these old ideas about, you know, of anointment, of Schrodinger, of Hawking, etc., etc., touring

29:54.000 --> 30:00.080
about the world as a computer. And at the moment, there's a system of selective pressures that

30:00.080 --> 30:05.200
partially has to do with how difficult it is to fund one's research. So I don't want, I'm very

30:05.200 --> 30:10.240
worried about the event horizon of the computational paradigm. It's absolutely true what Stephen is

30:10.240 --> 30:16.160
saying, that this is torn through theoretical physics, but I'm very dubious as I was.

30:16.160 --> 30:19.280
No, it hasn't. No, it hasn't. Not theoretical physics. No, it hasn't.

30:19.280 --> 30:25.120
The people aren't necessarily doing what you're saying, but they are dressing things up in terms

30:25.120 --> 30:31.520
of computation. So I think your interesting points, I think not quite right. Okay, so you're

30:31.520 --> 30:35.280
absolutely right that in theoretical physics, for example, quantum computing has become this

30:35.280 --> 30:38.880
giant, you know, a fundable thing. We can talk about that separately.

30:38.880 --> 30:44.000
Or black hole information paradoxes, or the idea of the universe as a computer, John Wheeler had

30:44.000 --> 30:49.600
old points, but that feel. But that's not what I'm talking about. That's not what I'm talking about.

30:49.600 --> 30:54.240
What I'm talking about is, there is a way of thinking about doing science that says,

30:54.240 --> 30:58.960
you write down an equation, you can solve this equation, and it will tell you how the world

30:58.960 --> 31:03.600
is going to work. Computational scientific material is sort of the old line of reductionism,

31:03.600 --> 31:07.680
which is if we could just solve these equations, we get beautiful, closed-form solutions.

31:07.680 --> 31:15.520
The surprising thing that, you know, I really got serious about in the 1980s was this phenomenon

31:15.520 --> 31:21.520
where if what you think is going on is that it's just following computational rules,

31:21.520 --> 31:26.240
then that doesn't work anymore. There's this phenomenon of computational irreducibility

31:26.240 --> 31:31.120
where the system is doing what it does, and it's doing a computation, and we're trying to figure

31:31.120 --> 31:35.680
out what the system does, and we're also doing a computation, and there's this thing I call the

31:35.680 --> 31:40.400
principle of computational equivalence, which is basically the statement or the claim, which we're

31:40.400 --> 31:45.680
getting more and more evidence for, that our ability to think through what a system does

31:45.680 --> 31:50.480
is of the same level of computational sophistication as what the system itself does.

31:50.480 --> 31:56.080
So we never get to outrun the system. We don't get to do what has been the kind of banner story

31:56.160 --> 32:02.240
of a lot of traditional mathematical science, which is find this reduction, this reducible

32:02.240 --> 32:07.520
computation where we can just say, and the system is going to do this. We're kind of stuck.

32:07.520 --> 32:11.840
There's the issue about whether we can compute it out once we find the rules.

32:11.840 --> 32:16.480
So the idea is that you could imagine a world in which Maxwell's equations are perfect, you know,

32:16.480 --> 32:22.400
all the way down, and you still might not be able to compute the consequences of Maxwell's equations

32:22.560 --> 32:28.000
like the Einstein equations like Navier-Stokes. It happens, but it's very obscure in those

32:28.000 --> 32:32.560
equations, because when you look at the Navier-Stokes equations, the standard equations for fluid

32:32.560 --> 32:38.560
flow, one of the most notable features of fluid flow is fluid turbulence. Fluid flows quickly,

32:38.560 --> 32:43.760
it looks kind of random. You say to people who study the Navier-Stokes equations, can you reproduce

32:43.760 --> 32:47.600
that from the underlying equations? Is that something that's in the underlying equations,

32:47.680 --> 32:52.160
or is it maybe a sign of some, you know, smaller scale molecular processes that are

32:52.160 --> 32:56.640
getting amplified, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera? So they'll typically get, I mean, these days they

32:56.640 --> 33:01.120
have a lot of empirical ways to do it, but if you really push on the fundamental question,

33:01.120 --> 33:03.280
they'll get kind of embarrassed because they just don't know.

33:03.280 --> 33:07.760
It's like quark confinement. If you know the rules of quarks, can you prove that they're

33:07.760 --> 33:12.400
not never going to be found in isolation and only going to be found typically in hadrons?

33:13.360 --> 33:19.360
Yeah, that's a similar thing, which actually has, that particular one actually has a more

33:19.360 --> 33:25.120
direct story of... Let's all agree that we're modern people and we don't have the old reductionist

33:25.120 --> 33:31.120
dream. That's a non-trivial point because in theoretical physics, that point has not yet been

33:31.120 --> 33:36.400
understood. Well, I think it has. I think that the extent to which we talk about what is emergent,

33:36.960 --> 33:42.640
what is not, what is enthropic, what is not, we now have many concepts, including, you know,

33:42.640 --> 33:48.240
galois sorts of, not galois, girdle sorts of concerns that are cropping up in theoretical

33:48.240 --> 33:53.280
physics. Finally, yes. I wrote the paper about undersideability in theoretical physics back

33:53.280 --> 33:58.880
in the early 1980s. I think it needs to be said, you know, again, by somebody who hopes to be your

33:58.880 --> 34:04.240
competitor, that you were very early on a lot of these topics. You weren't doing it as part of a

34:04.240 --> 34:09.040
fad. You were in fact the pioneer coming out of the computational ability of mathematics and all

34:09.040 --> 34:13.920
that you've set up. And you've wrapped some beautiful libraries with many more functions than

34:13.920 --> 34:19.440
anybody ever thought we could have. So, you know, kudos to you. There was a huge resistance inside

34:19.440 --> 34:25.120
of theoretical physics because it was a very closed, arrogant community. It had many reasons to be

34:25.120 --> 34:32.400
arrogant. It has fewer reasons to be arrogant now. And so in part, I think that you were dismissed

34:32.400 --> 34:37.280
unfairly. It's very important that you not be the one to blow your own horn. So I would be happy

34:37.280 --> 34:42.560
to say that I remember when that book came out, I remember the derision, the anger didn't seem to

34:42.560 --> 34:49.600
come from anywhere in particular. And it was not listened to properly, even though I don't think

34:49.600 --> 34:56.160
that it actually is doing what you say it's doing now. But one, happy to be wrong. And it was always

34:56.160 --> 35:00.560
a really important point that you were making within that. I just don't think that it really

35:01.040 --> 35:04.880
hurt. What do you make of that, Steven? Hold on a second. I want to just correct that impression.

35:04.880 --> 35:12.480
Because the fact is, you know, I was looking at this recently, right? Insofar as there was

35:12.480 --> 35:17.920
negativism about that book, where did it actually come from? Because there was tons of positivism.

35:17.920 --> 35:25.600
I mean, the negativism, it turns out, was specifically concentrated in people who did

35:25.600 --> 35:32.640
fundamental physics. And if you look outside of that area, it was not negativism, it was actually

35:32.640 --> 35:37.680
a lot of positivism. But to steal man the critics, which I hate to do, the critics have a feeling

35:37.680 --> 35:43.360
that there's a tiny number of fields where it's very difficult to check people. It's very hard to

35:43.360 --> 35:49.120
say when a theoretical physicist is bullshitting. It's very hard to say when a theoretical, very pure

35:49.200 --> 35:56.880
mathematician is speaking nonsense. So there is this fear. How do we know that what he's saying

35:56.880 --> 36:02.000
in some sense is correct? Correct enough to interrupt, but correct enough to devote

36:02.000 --> 36:06.640
many precious hours to unravel it. There's that, but there's not that much to unravel

36:06.640 --> 36:10.240
at the moment. So I'm not that sympathetic with that. You know, this is sort of Sabine. I don't

36:10.240 --> 36:15.120
have time for this stuff. My feeling is, to hell you don't have time. There's almost nothing happening.

36:15.120 --> 36:20.800
Now, with that said, what I think is, is that there was a fear that quite honestly people like

36:20.800 --> 36:27.280
you and like myself are cheating. And just I want to be open about this. The fear that comes out of

36:27.280 --> 36:32.720
whatever is left of the core community is you guys don't have a right to go direct to a consumer.

36:32.720 --> 36:38.800
You don't have a right to talk about the field that belongs to a tiny, the privilege of a tiny

36:38.800 --> 36:43.680
number of people who do this morning, noon and night, who are all possessed of common beliefs.

36:43.680 --> 36:47.920
And that's something that both you and I have been fighting. Now, I would also suggest that

36:47.920 --> 36:54.480
Stephen and I probably are not eager to open the door to every lunatic with a red crayon who

36:54.480 --> 36:59.520
wants to scribble something on a roll of paper towels and say that they've got a unified theory.

36:59.520 --> 37:04.240
So there have to be some standards. On the other hand, the core group that's been trying to gate

37:04.240 --> 37:10.800
this has failed. It was historically interesting to me. So I was, you know, I did particle physics

37:10.800 --> 37:16.240
during its kind of golden age in the late 1970s when I was a late teenager, so to speak.

37:16.240 --> 37:22.960
And I think I did pretty well. You know, a bunch of I got, you know, got was was sort of pretty

37:22.960 --> 37:27.440
successful in the field. And I wrote a bunch of papers that still get cited because I lived in

37:27.440 --> 37:32.240
the sort of golden age and not a lot came after that. I mean, not because they were necessarily,

37:32.880 --> 37:36.720
you know, there was a question of picking low hanging fruit. And so that meant that I

37:36.720 --> 37:41.840
know a large fraction of the kind of leading people in theoretical physics above some age.

37:41.840 --> 37:49.120
I was quite surprised by the level of kind of angst when new kind of science came out.

37:49.120 --> 37:53.920
But the typical thing that I heard was, oh, my gosh, if this is right, what we've been doing for

37:53.920 --> 37:58.400
the last 50 years, all has to be thrown away. And I kept on saying, I don't think that's what's

37:58.400 --> 38:04.320
going to happen. You know, and people would say to me like, you know, I was I was noticing, I think

38:04.400 --> 38:08.320
I made a you know, wrote a sort of historical piece about this. And I described it as

38:08.320 --> 38:13.440
Nobel Prize winners with pitchforks. And so there was a was a quite a parade. It was quite it's

38:13.440 --> 38:17.600
quite kind of interesting looking back on it. I was going to send one of them an email actually,

38:17.600 --> 38:22.240
just when my new thing came out. And then the person went and died. So they die or they soften.

38:22.240 --> 38:28.000
I think what was interesting to me was at that time, 20 years ago, there was a lot of kind of,

38:28.880 --> 38:33.040
you know, we're going to make it string theory is going to do it. We're almost there. You know,

38:33.040 --> 38:36.480
we don't need anything else. I think that's changed now.

38:36.480 --> 38:40.880
That's about 1984 through 86, when the string mania was at its height.

38:40.880 --> 38:47.760
No, I think that, you know, now, you know, we've got a lot of mostly younger physicists

38:47.760 --> 38:53.200
who are pretty seriously working on this stuff. And I think, you know, it's it's going great.

38:53.760 --> 39:00.640
Of the older crowd, you know, I sort of been in contact with a large fraction of them. And it's

39:00.640 --> 39:05.040
like, Oh, this seems interesting. And it's like, you should actually work on this. I keep on telling

39:05.040 --> 39:09.200
him you should actually work on it. And some of them have, you know, been on live streams,

39:09.200 --> 39:12.480
we've done and things like that. And we certainly talked about things. But I think,

39:12.480 --> 39:17.040
you know, a lot of people, they do something for a living. And this isn't what they do for a living.

39:17.040 --> 39:21.920
And I don't know whether they'll kind of make the effort to kind of turn what the change what

39:21.920 --> 39:26.960
they do for a living. I don't know whether it matters. I think that the the concept that,

39:27.200 --> 39:32.880
you know, it is probably particularly 20 years ago, it was still the case that the kind of

39:32.880 --> 39:38.240
institutional structure of things like physics was very strong. As in, it was like, we have

39:38.240 --> 39:42.720
this institutional structure, and this is how this field is going to work. And we don't do anything

39:42.720 --> 39:47.040
from the outside. My impression is that that's weakened in the intervening years. But maybe

39:47.040 --> 39:53.680
I'm wrong. The perception that I get from comments from people is almost like being

39:53.680 --> 39:59.200
candid with both of you as friends. On one hand, Eric is criticized for a complexity,

39:59.920 --> 40:07.040
a technical, you know, sort of toolkit that is beyond even many theoretical physicists. So,

40:07.040 --> 40:11.040
you know, I disagree that, you know, they'll say, I don't have enough time, but but it is true that

40:11.040 --> 40:16.320
there's, you know, general stock and trade of a theoretical cosmologist is not necessarily

40:16.320 --> 40:21.360
hop vibrations, fiber bundles, etc. It might be perturbation theory, it might be quantum field

40:21.360 --> 40:27.840
theory. And on the other side of the coin, Steven, I think sometimes the perception is it's too

40:27.840 --> 40:33.440
simplistic, not in the sense or it's too elementary. It's too fundamental in the sense that you use

40:33.440 --> 40:37.520
in your in your wonderful new book, which you're kind of enough to send to me. And congratulations

40:37.520 --> 40:42.320
for writing a shorter book than a new kind of science, I think by about 40 pages. Brian gets a

40:42.320 --> 40:47.200
copy. I think Steven will send you one or I'll give you one when we get together. I've got multiple

40:47.200 --> 40:52.960
copies. But Steven, you know, so let me let me just start with with you for a second. Eric knows

40:52.960 --> 40:56.720
his critics, he knows what people say, and I think he brings up a good point. Wait, I have

40:56.720 --> 41:01.280
critics, this is the first I hear of this, Brian. There's two, one's named Pia something and the

41:01.280 --> 41:06.640
other one. But Steven, in your case, I think it's absolutely correct that, you know, people are

41:06.640 --> 41:11.680
blown away by the contributions. I have people, you know, asking me to thank you from the depths

41:11.680 --> 41:17.680
of their heart for for Mathematica for new kind of science that in some ways, it's amazing that

41:17.680 --> 41:22.560
you guys have, I get comments, I'm reading them, you save my life, you touch my life, you change

41:22.560 --> 41:28.560
my life. It's so amazing. But on the other hand, I think that that in in real scientific circles,

41:28.560 --> 41:35.040
oftentimes breeds a class of almost undermining and let me explain something which is which I

41:35.040 --> 41:42.800
think is interesting. So I am that people think what I've done is simplistic is a great compliment

41:42.800 --> 41:47.840
because I've spent a huge amount of effort trying to take the things that I'm thinking about and

41:47.840 --> 41:52.880
make them simple enough that both I can understand them well, and I can explain them well. When I

41:52.880 --> 41:58.240
wrote new kind of science, I even said this in the introduction, I said, the fact that this appears

41:58.240 --> 42:04.240
to be very simple, appears to be very straightforward, will make people who thought, you know, who work

42:04.320 --> 42:09.760
on technical science think that, you know, they must, they must really understand this and this

42:09.760 --> 42:15.760
must be something simple and irrelevant. It isn't true. You know, the fact is, it is, it is much

42:15.760 --> 42:20.400
more difficult, at least for me, maybe it isn't for everybody, but I think it probably is for

42:20.400 --> 42:26.240
almost everybody, to turn things into things that can be described simply than it is to kind of,

42:26.240 --> 42:30.800
you know, maybe there's a certain challenge to sort of building up the tower of being able to

42:30.800 --> 42:36.240
talk about, you know, fiber bundles and self-dual connections and all this kind of thing, but,

42:36.240 --> 42:41.600
but that's a, it's a well-defined tower you have to climb. So, for example, right now, I happen to

42:41.600 --> 42:47.120
be working on kind of a very bizarre thing that, again, I never thought would come out, which is

42:47.120 --> 42:54.160
a kind of a, a general theory of metamathematics. So in mathematics, one, one thinks about, you

42:54.160 --> 42:57.760
know, there's the particular mathematics people do, the three million theorems of mathematics

42:57.760 --> 43:02.000
that have been published in the literature of mathematics and human history, but then there's

43:02.000 --> 43:07.440
the kind of full metamathematics of all possible theorems. And the remarkable thing is that it

43:07.440 --> 43:12.880
looks like we can actually derive kind of the analog of Einstein's equations in metamathematical

43:12.880 --> 43:20.400
space, a very bizarre. We keep coming to this point. I want to just put a pin here just in case

43:20.400 --> 43:30.560
it's of interest. I don't think that it's very difficult to imagine recovering Einstein's equations

43:30.560 --> 43:36.160
given Hilbert's contribution so that we know in a weird sense that Einstein did something very,

43:36.160 --> 43:41.200
very difficult. And I've compared it to Half Dome where there's a sheer face that Einstein went up,

43:41.200 --> 43:45.440
and then there's this gentle face that Hilbert went up after he knew that it could be climbed.

43:45.440 --> 43:50.640
It seems to me that because we know that Einstein's equations results from the simplest

43:50.640 --> 43:56.000
objective function that you could have, which is the scalar curvature in Rouhani and geometry,

43:56.000 --> 44:01.840
that that's not a great target. I mean, it's great that you can produce something that looks like

44:01.840 --> 44:08.480
Einstein's theory out of computational rules. The next one on the list would be Yang-Mills

44:08.480 --> 44:18.000
theory. They're only really four basic equations. Again, the objective function is as simple as

44:18.000 --> 44:25.440
it gets. So to Stephen's point, what we know about the current physical world is that two out of the

44:25.440 --> 44:31.040
four equations, fundamental equations for the fields, the things that dance in our world and we call

44:31.040 --> 44:36.640
particles or waves, both of those come from the simplest possible curvature equations that one

44:36.640 --> 44:41.360
can have in geometry. So if you think of the geometries largely about curvature, then the two

44:41.360 --> 44:46.880
simplest structures that can generate equations called the Yang-Mills Lagrangian or the Yang-Mills

44:46.880 --> 44:52.480
Maxwell Lagrangian, which is just you take the size of the curvature and you square it and that's

44:52.480 --> 44:57.840
it. And the other one is you just take a piece of the curvature without squaring it when you have

44:57.840 --> 45:02.160
a piece to take called the scalar curvature and that's it. The other two equations have a slightly

45:02.160 --> 45:08.640
different character. I want to leave aside the Higgs field and what we would call the Klein-Gordon

45:08.640 --> 45:14.960
equation with the potential. But I would say the next order of business is do you find the Dirac

45:14.960 --> 45:23.360
equation? Because it's very difficult to find spinners arising from computational rules.

45:23.840 --> 45:32.640
So the answer is do we know how we managed to get spinner representations in the rotation group?

45:32.640 --> 45:38.160
We know how to construct these things. There is a mystery about why they are there to construct.

45:38.160 --> 45:42.320
Now there are people who will go to their graves saying there is no mystery, I know how to construct

45:42.320 --> 45:47.760
it, therefore I know what it is, which is never true. I mean we only really understand something

45:47.760 --> 45:51.600
in mathematics when we can walk all around it and see it from many different angles.

45:52.560 --> 45:57.680
I agree that we know how to construct spinners, I know how to construct Dirac operators,

45:57.680 --> 46:03.840
but this is a highly non-trivial question in our world. It comes out of what I call the psychedelic

46:03.840 --> 46:08.960
of mathematics, the square root construction, where you ask a question like what is x squared

46:09.920 --> 46:14.480
equals minus one? It has no solution in the reels. You have to jump into another space

46:15.040 --> 46:20.960
in order to answer the question. So it has this different character which is the answer to the

46:21.040 --> 46:27.600
problem isn't found in the space in which the problem was posed. In the case of Einstein's

46:27.600 --> 46:31.840
equations and in the Yang-Mills equations or the souped up version of Maxwell's equations,

46:31.840 --> 46:39.120
non-linear Maxwell theory if you will, you have something which has a character where I understand

46:39.120 --> 46:43.760
where it comes from. In the case of the Dirac equation, you have got much bigger problems.

46:43.760 --> 46:49.520
I tried to bring this up in the last live stream, it didn't work at all. What do you do in quantum

46:49.600 --> 46:57.760
gravity when you don't have an observation of the metric, for example, and therefore you cannot

46:57.760 --> 47:03.920
construct the ocean in which the electron is a wave? Now, if you think about it very carefully,

47:04.640 --> 47:10.720
in a weird way, electrons are basically functions and photons are basically derivative operators.

47:11.760 --> 47:18.320
That's a bizarre way to think about it. I know the mathematical physics, so I understand what

47:18.320 --> 47:24.160
you're talking about. Then you wouldn't say it's a bizarre way at all, I don't think in any event.

47:24.160 --> 47:29.840
What we're talking about is we're talking about versions of the xy plane and functions and

47:29.840 --> 47:35.760
derivatives. The idea of the xy plane that grows up to become something called fiber bundles which

47:35.760 --> 47:40.880
Stephen mentioned at the beginning. The idea of functions grows up to be something called sections

47:40.880 --> 47:46.720
and the idea of derivatives grows up to be something called connections. These are the basic bread and

47:46.720 --> 47:53.200
butter of what goes on before you get to the quantum. In that picture, there's a big difference

47:53.200 --> 48:00.400
between recovering the easiest bits and recovering the hardest bits. I don't mean to put extra weight

48:00.400 --> 48:08.160
on Stephen's shoulders. If he can do the first bits, that's great, but there's a series of challenges

48:08.160 --> 48:14.640
that are of escalating difficulty in terms of recovery because of the simplicity of some portions

48:14.640 --> 48:19.040
of our model and the Baroque complexity of other portions of the model. For example, the internal

48:19.040 --> 48:23.600
quantum number assignments that give the particles their personality, the number of generations,

48:23.600 --> 48:31.280
the chirality of the situation. It's very interesting. Stephen's rules are going to have to pick a left

48:31.280 --> 48:36.240
or a right, so it's very interesting to how he's going to recover a chiral world.

48:36.240 --> 48:44.000
This is silly. Let me give you my point of view here. We can talk about details of mathematical

48:44.000 --> 48:50.320
physics. It's quite interesting. I know you know a bunch about it. We can go deeply into

48:51.520 --> 48:59.920
how half-interjust spin versus interjusting particles work, etc. What you're doing is you're

48:59.920 --> 49:07.040
making the paradigm shift mistake. You're talking about things in terms of existing mathematical

49:07.040 --> 49:12.480
physics ideas. Yes, you're saying, oh my gosh, you'll never be able to get spinners.

49:12.640 --> 49:18.720
No, I'm just saying let me just make a few points about this. Okay, I mean the fact is

49:20.240 --> 49:25.680
we're actually hot on the trail of understanding how fermions versus bosons work. It's quite

49:25.680 --> 49:33.520
interesting. It has to do, it seems, with cases where in our, and again, it's sort of a somewhat

49:33.520 --> 49:40.240
complicated story, but it's these branch pairs and branch shield space, whether they end up being

49:40.240 --> 49:46.560
things that merge after a small number of steps or not, seems to be what is the distinguishing

49:46.560 --> 49:51.360
feature between bosons and fermions, how that relates to half-interjust spin. We don't completely

49:51.360 --> 49:56.640
know. It seems to be related to various features of homotopy in the multi-way causal graph.

49:57.680 --> 50:02.160
It's quite possible that some of the kinds of mathematical physics that you like a lot are

50:02.160 --> 50:07.920
highly relevant in understanding how that homotopy works in the multi-way causal graph. It looks like

50:07.920 --> 50:12.640
a limit of the multi-way causal graph is quite possibly related to Twister theory,

50:12.640 --> 50:18.240
and that one can understand some of the things that happen there on the basis of Twister theory,

50:18.240 --> 50:22.960
whether we can get, we're now understood, we've understood quite a bit about how rotational

50:22.960 --> 50:28.720
invariance works, how angular momentum works, but it's kind of a weird business because in a

50:28.720 --> 50:35.280
sense, we're trying to build from the machine code up. We can have a detailed mathematical

50:35.280 --> 50:40.560
physics conversation. That's what most people are interested in. Oh, I disagree. I think that

50:40.560 --> 50:46.640
people actually want to see whether or not, you know, both of us are saying outlandish things.

50:46.640 --> 50:51.840
By the way, I don't think what I was saying was silly at all. It started mathematical physics.

50:51.840 --> 50:56.000
I think it's all started mathematical physics. I'm going to invoke my referee. I'm going to

50:56.000 --> 51:00.320
hold on. Hold on one second. I do want to point something out. I think it's very important. I've

51:00.320 --> 51:04.960
heard this from people that I hold in high esteem, Paul Steinhart. One reason that Paul

51:04.960 --> 51:12.080
says he refuses to ever get a Facebook or Twitter account is because he would invariably be tempted

51:12.080 --> 51:18.240
to propose an interesting idea, which by necessity would be new, novel, untested, unproven at some

51:18.240 --> 51:25.200
level. And then immediately it would be attacked, assailed, subjugated to constraints and concerns.

51:25.200 --> 51:30.960
And I think you guys have both seen that for the following reason, that you both are master

51:30.960 --> 51:36.960
explicators of what you do. You both are obviously domain experts in what you know and you understand

51:36.960 --> 51:41.760
the other branches of physics and mathematics that are pertinent to it. However, neither one

51:41.760 --> 51:47.920
really knows the intimacy of the other one's theories. And I think it's important to realize

51:47.920 --> 51:54.240
that just like people assailing your theories from without, I think it's too soon to tell,

51:54.240 --> 51:59.600
at least in the case of Stephen's work, which is, you know, in some sense, 20 years old or

51:59.600 --> 52:04.640
coming up on 20 years old. And in some sense, it's also brand new, because I think when you look

52:04.640 --> 52:08.320
at the successful applications, I feel like we should just check those off, Stephen. I mean,

52:08.320 --> 52:13.920
biological systems, crystallography, you go down the list, finance, economics, where the

52:13.920 --> 52:21.200
Wolfram approach, the new kind of science approach first outlined in 2003 or so, that has already

52:21.200 --> 52:25.200
been proven. It doesn't need to be proven. Where I think it's different is where we lay on this extra

52:25.200 --> 52:31.120
layer of computability as a fundamental nature of the universe, which for my perception, maybe

52:31.120 --> 52:36.480
Stephen, correct me if I'm wrong, has sort of a multiverse component to it. You talk about

52:36.480 --> 52:42.320
different aspects of the universe. Well, you talk in an essay that you wrote in 2017 about,

52:42.320 --> 52:46.960
you know, the space of all universes where these rules... That was before I understood what I now

52:46.960 --> 52:52.320
understand. Yeah. So, but we are barely coming up to where you were in 2017. So, can we take a step

52:52.320 --> 52:58.640
back? We talked about the paradigm issue. I want to talk a little bit more about how these ideas get

52:58.640 --> 53:03.520
into the firmament or get into the zeitgeist. Yeah, before you do that, I want to just clear

53:03.520 --> 53:12.560
something up. Stephen, I'm not trying to scuttle your theory. I believe that your theory, if you

53:12.560 --> 53:19.200
have an approach that works and it's a face up the same mountain, my belief is that you will get

53:19.200 --> 53:23.360
to answer these questions. You may tell us for the first time, spiritually, what a spinner is

53:24.000 --> 53:29.840
from a computational perspective. I'm not saying you've only done the easy stuff and the other

53:29.840 --> 53:34.560
stuff is really hard. The stuff that you're talking about is really hard. What's going to pick out

53:34.560 --> 53:39.760
the Riemann curvature tensor? How are you going to generate this? Great. That one's fairly easy.

53:39.760 --> 53:44.000
Well, I believe that because it's very natural. There's a reason that in some sense it came first

53:44.960 --> 53:50.640
before the Wu Yang dictionary. I think spinners are going to come out as the latest thing,

53:50.640 --> 53:55.440
which is only a week old. So it's still uncooked. So we're tricking him to sharing this on the

53:55.440 --> 54:00.560
live stream. It's exclusive. This is very good here. Well, we probably talked about it on how

54:00.560 --> 54:06.320
working session live streams. But first point is in our models, quantum mechanics is a very natural

54:06.320 --> 54:12.880
thing. When we think about traditional classical mechanics, it's like you throw a ball, it goes

54:12.880 --> 54:20.160
in a definite direction. In quantum mechanics, the idea is that the ball tests out all possible

54:20.160 --> 54:25.760
paths and then we only get to see various probabilities about what happens. In our models,

54:25.760 --> 54:30.880
there are these things called multi-way systems, which basically are enumerating all the possible

54:30.880 --> 54:37.840
paths. And the whole dynamics of how quantum mechanics works comes out of these multi-way

54:37.840 --> 54:44.240
systems. Now, what happens is when you look at one of these multi-way systems at a particular time,

54:44.240 --> 54:47.600
you take a slice through it and you get this thing we call branch shield space.

54:48.240 --> 54:54.400
Branch shield space is the analog in the space of quantum states to physical space in kind of

54:54.400 --> 55:00.080
ordinary position in the universe. By physical space, you mean a space like hyperspace?

55:00.080 --> 55:05.200
These branch shield surfaces are the analog that branch like hypersurfaces, which are the analog

55:05.200 --> 55:11.360
of space like hypersurfaces in standard spacetime. So this branch like hypersurface in branch

55:11.360 --> 55:16.560
shield space, there's an extent in branch shield space, which is where as you move through branch

55:16.560 --> 55:21.440
shield space, you're moving through the space of quantum entanglements. And so states that are

55:21.440 --> 55:25.840
further away in branch shield space are less quantum entangled than states which are close

55:25.840 --> 55:30.160
in branch shield space. What is your notion of a distance? Well, it's based on, if you look at

55:30.160 --> 55:36.240
the multi-way graph, the nearest neighbors in branch shield space are things which have a common

55:36.240 --> 55:42.480
ancestor one step back in the multi-way graph. So those are what we call branch pairs. I mean,

55:42.480 --> 55:46.320
this is, unfortunately, it gets fairly... I appreciate that, but the idea is you have some

55:46.320 --> 55:52.400
ordering by number of steps. Metric, yes. Metric like. It's based on sort of common ancestry in

55:52.400 --> 55:59.200
the multi-way graph. And essentially what happens is, well, that thing on the left is a multi-way

55:59.200 --> 56:04.720
causal graph. The thing on the right is a kind of play version of a kind of mixture of branch

56:04.720 --> 56:10.240
shield space and physical space. Probably not the best visualization, but it's something. But

56:10.240 --> 56:15.920
anyway, so the idea is there's physical space that we're all familiar with. There's this branch

56:15.920 --> 56:21.120
shield space, which is the kind of space of quantum states, just like there's a speed of light

56:21.680 --> 56:25.920
in physical space. In our model, there's a maximum entanglement speed in branch shield

56:25.920 --> 56:31.040
space, which is kind of the maximum speed at which kind of you can... maximum speed of kind

56:31.040 --> 56:37.360
of entanglement in that space. So, okay. Why is any of this relevant? Again, this is... I'm

56:38.720 --> 56:43.920
in the Einstein equations, which have to do with physical space. One is looking at,

56:43.920 --> 56:48.560
in the one way to view the Einstein equations, is to think about what happens to a GDC, what

56:48.560 --> 56:53.360
happens to the path of a particle in spacetime. Essentially, what's happening in the Einstein

56:53.360 --> 57:03.440
equations is that energy momentum causes deflections in GD6 in spacetime. In a branch

57:03.440 --> 57:10.160
shield space, the exact same thing happens. Essentially, energy momentum causes deflections

57:10.160 --> 57:17.040
in GD6 in branch shield space. And it turns out that that deflection process gives one the Feynman

57:17.040 --> 57:22.560
path integral, which is really cool. And it's one of the things that I sort of found the most

57:22.560 --> 57:28.640
elegant in the things that we've done so far in this theory, that what in physical space is

57:28.640 --> 57:33.920
the Einstein equations in branch shield space is the path integral. Okay. Why is this relevant to

57:33.920 --> 57:39.280
fermions and bosons? The reason it's relevant is that... Wait, wait. I just want to take a moment

57:39.280 --> 57:45.360
to think about what you just said. You said that something in general relativity, that is Einstein's

57:45.360 --> 57:53.840
equations, which are maximally resistant of all of our structures to quantization, is analogous,

57:53.840 --> 57:59.680
in some ways, to the Feynman path integral, which I'm going to disagree later with your

57:59.680 --> 58:04.160
characterization, which is Feynman's sort of characterization, the linguistic description

58:04.160 --> 58:09.520
of what we claim is happening when we're taking one of these integrals. But the point is, is that

58:09.520 --> 58:15.600
you're just making a claim on Poisson, which is astounding to begin with, if true. Which is that

58:15.600 --> 58:24.000
the Einstein equations are somehow intimately bound up in the quintessential centerpiece of

58:24.960 --> 58:31.280
quantum field theory, not even quantum mechanics. The Einstein equations... I mean,

58:31.280 --> 58:38.720
this is a remarkable thing, which I certainly did not see coming, that the path integral is the exact

58:38.720 --> 58:42.640
same thing as the Einstein equations, but in a different kind of space. Never heard this. Right.

58:42.640 --> 58:46.880
So that's one of the things that we discovered like, I don't know, six, seven months ago,

58:46.880 --> 58:52.160
that was like, wow. And those two things meet up when you think about black holes and black hole

58:52.160 --> 58:56.560
information and so on. There's sort of this... And in fact, the ADS-CFT correspondence is almost

58:56.560 --> 59:03.040
certainly taking this multi-way causal graph and projecting it into spacetime and projecting it

59:03.040 --> 59:08.080
into branchial space. That it's the same graph projected in two different ways, corresponds

59:08.160 --> 59:13.600
to the kind of general relativity ADS side of ADS-CFT and the quantum field theory CFT side of

59:13.600 --> 59:18.320
it. That's almost certainly what that is. And various people are working on filling in the

59:18.320 --> 59:23.760
details of that. It's pretty neat. So then, okay, you asked about fermions and bosons,

59:23.760 --> 59:28.800
and I was going to tell you this week's kind of way of getting to that. And these are complicated

59:28.800 --> 59:34.960
things. So it takes a few steps. Okay. So the next thing to realize is in quantum mechanics,

59:34.960 --> 59:40.560
one of the things that emerged particularly from von Neumann's work was this idea of, there is an

59:40.560 --> 59:46.800
amplitude. It is a complex number. It operates in Hilbert space, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

59:46.800 --> 59:50.880
One of the things that was implicitly done was something which I think turns out to be a mistake,

59:51.440 --> 59:58.720
which is that the magnitude and the phase of these quantum amplitudes were sort of all packaged

59:58.720 --> 01:00:04.000
together. You mean the projectivization of a Hilbert space? Yes. Yes. Well, the fact that

01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:09.200
the fact that you can think about it as a magnitude and phase is just a complex number.

01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:17.360
In our models, what ends up happening is the magnitude and the phase come from completely

01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:22.400
different places. And so what happens is the magnitude has to do with accounting of paths

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:26.800
going through this multigraph. The phase has to do with essentially where you land up in

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:32.800
branchial space. And actually, one of the things that we figured out about a week or two ago is

01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:38.560
it's just unbelievably easy to get the double slit experiment to work. And we get nice pictures.

01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:41.200
Yeah, I don't know what that means. But the first point, if I understand...

01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:42.800
Oh, no, it's interference in quantum mechanics.

01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:43.040
Right?

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:43.760
I understand that.

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:49.120
You mean you don't understand how it's easy. It comes out naturally in some sense.

01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:53.840
No. What he's saying, I mean, we have to go back and unpack what the good doctor is saying.

01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:59.040
He is talking about the fact that we claim that we work in a Hilbert space. We don't work in a

01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:03.600
Hilbert space. We work in something called the projectivization of a Hilbert space.

01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:09.120
And effectively, that destroys a certain amount of structure. So we begin with something like a

01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:14.080
vector space. We remove the origin. We pluck it out like the seed out of a cherry. And then we take,

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:18.720
you know, all of the sort of meat and we compress it in this particular way. And what Stephen is

01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:24.400
saying is that that is a loss of information that we teach physicists with their mother's milk,

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:29.200
and that this may be, in fact, throwing away information that is actually experimentally

01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:30.800
much more important.

01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:36.160
Well, I mean, I think that let's not go off into projective Hilbert space for a minute.

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:41.040
You guys never take me anywhere.

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:44.640
Buy me to the Hilbert space.

01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:52.640
All right. The thing that ends up being interesting is the when you think about kind of these,

01:01:53.360 --> 01:02:01.200
these, again, this is the kind of the sort of quantum gd6. What ends up happening is the phase

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:06.000
of the quantum amplitude is essentially defined by its position in Braunschild space. So you think

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:11.360
about these in general relativity, you'd think about, you know, a gd6 is deflected by the presence

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:17.200
of mass, you know, it's attracted to some massive object, moves around it, it changes the direction

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:24.960
of the gd6 has changed by the presence of mass. Okay. In in Braunschild space, it's the same story.

01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:30.160
The the the gd6 is deflected by the presence of energy momentum. That presence of energy

01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:35.360
momentum corresponds to Lagrangian and quantum field theory. And what one is doing is deflecting

01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:40.880
that gd6, the deflection of the gd6. The interpretation of that is it's changing the

01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:45.760
phase of the quantum amplitude. It's changing where that gd6 is going to land in Braunschild

01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:50.400
space, which changes the phase of the quantum amplitude. And amusingly enough, what appears in

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:56.640
the Feynman-Path integral is exactly e to the i over h bar times the action integral. The action

01:02:56.640 --> 01:03:02.080
integral is the integral in our world of the divergence of causal edges, which corresponds

01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:06.880
to Lagrangian. There seem to be multiple things going on here. If I can just I do want to invoke

01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:13.280
my my privilege here being being the moderator. We've covered the first of our six or seven topics

01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:18.000
in 40 and an hour and 15 minutes. It's clear to me. I just want to finish on bosons for a second.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:22.720
Okay, please. Yeah, please finish up. Let's move to our next, which will be experimental testability.

01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:30.480
The flavor of of this is that what ends up happening with bosons is this kind of collection

01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:35.760
in Braunschild space, this this kind of focusing in Braunschild space. And what seems to happen

01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:40.560
with fermions is a divergence in Braunschild space. And it's, you know, one of the things that

01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:45.280
I've been always been curious about is why are there only fermions and bosons? Why isn't there

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:50.480
lots of, you know, intermediate para statistics and so on. And I think that the answer is that

01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:55.840
it's going to end up being the case that basically in Braunschild space, things either diverge or

01:03:55.840 --> 01:04:00.800
they don't diverge. And that's going to but you know, there's there's much mathematical physics

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:05.760
packing that has to go around this. And if I could just take 15 seconds to riff off this.

01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:10.640
Okay, you have a situation in which the great thing about general relativity, for example,

01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:16.400
is that all you need is length and angle. And length and angle turns out to amount to a derivative

01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:20.800
operator, which turns out to have mixed partials that don't commute, you can measure their failure,

01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:25.600
that's the curvature, you knock it down with linear algebra, and you create grab. It's a miracle.

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:30.720
It's fantastic. On the other hand, it's not that surprising that if you have a situation in which

01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:38.560
you have some notion of like size and perpendicularity, that you can create something like that. For

01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:42.720
example, you do have something called malinobus distance that you can get out of data, you can

01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:49.280
treat a covariance matrix like a Ramanian metric, if you will. So there are all sorts of ways in

01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:54.640
which we already know that they're that the discrete that anything that leads to length and

01:04:54.640 --> 01:05:01.120
angle becomes geometric. And I think that, you know, that's both very good for Dr. Wolfram,

01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:07.120
and it is also just a bit of caution for the rest of us that on the the early part may lead you on

01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:12.560
because it's a different way of describing length and angle and the consequences, which

01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:18.800
thanks to both Einstein and Grossman and I guess, Hilbert, we know that all we're looking for in some

01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:24.480
sense is the most basic consequence of that. It'll be cool to see it come out. And I do

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:29.680
believe that you you may likely get fermions out of a question. You may have to ask the question

01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:33.440
about how to take the square root of something. I'll be astounded if you have fermions without

01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:41.040
taking a square root. But the key feature, you know, is that you're not that far away from geometry

01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:44.800
as soon as you're talking about malinobus distance and covariance matrix and data.

01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:50.640
Okay, so, you know, the one cool thing is that the uncertainty principle in our theory is basically

01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:57.040
the analog of Riemann curvature in branchial space. So the the non commuting of variables

01:05:57.040 --> 01:06:02.320
is just like a non commuting. And in geometric quantization, it is literally the curvature

01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:08.160
tensor on in the Hamiltonian picture. Absolutely. So by the way, in terms of the square root thing,

01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:14.320
I have the following guess, okay, that what basically happens in branchial spaces, you have

01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:20.480
these branch pairs, and they converge. Okay, branch pairs. Next step, they converge. I think

01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:26.160
that the boson cases, they diverge and they converge. The fermion cases, they diverge and

01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:31.680
they don't converge. And so in some sense, the square root is being taken by the fact that you

01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:36.080
are having the the beginning of that diamond, but not the end of the diamond. Sounds like the

01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:41.360
difference between commutators and anticommutators. Yeah, yeah, it's the it's the it's my my first

01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:47.200
guess about how that works. And it'll it's I mean, the thing that again, I thought we were going to

01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:52.480
have to, you know, find actual electrons to be able to distinguish fermions and bosons,

01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:58.240
it's seeming increasingly likely that we can basically understand fermions in bulk without

01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:03.760
having to know exactly how particles work. What I want to do now is sort of compare and contrast

01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:08.960
different approaches, not necessarily only from the two of you. But in the in the context that I

01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:13.600
often get, well, first of all, the common thing that I get from all my, you know, friends on Reddit

01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:18.160
or wherever else this gets posted is, you know, how come these things aren't being peer reviewed

01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:23.360
and what kinds of falsifiable predictions are they making? Let's start with the latter. Steven,

01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:28.240
you and I talked back in April, and you made it clear that things such as the fundamental

01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:34.400
constants of nature, the speed of light are emergent or embedded encoded encrypted within

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:40.640
within your new findings. I want to know, are there new predictions that could be used instead

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:45.040
of retradictions? Not that they don't have validity, not that they don't have a value.

01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:50.320
After all, Einstein, you know, in some sense validated his his theory on a retradiction,

01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:53.680
which was known for a million, you know, millions of years. It was known for years,

01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:58.960
the perihelion advance of the planet Mercury, and it had to be reconciled with with Einstein's

01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:03.600
predictions. And through observations, it was found to be true. I want to know,

01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:10.400
Steven, are there new fundamental predictions that you can can point to that have at least,

01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:14.720
in principle, a chance of being detected? And then I'll have a similar question for Eric.

01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:22.000
Well, let's see, I don't do the the dueling theories theory, but but yeah, falsifiability is a

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:28.640
weird concept that has all kinds of problems. But the fact is, you know, first thing is,

01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:33.040
the number one thing that we're building is a framework, like calculus.

01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:39.680
Calculus is not something that's falsifiable. Calculus is a framework for doing things.

01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:47.920
Second question is, does calculus usefully apply to the universe? That's something we can

01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:53.360
validly ask. And that's something that, you know, we can, there are things which are sort of generic

01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:59.440
predictions from the framework. So the thing we're trying to do right now is what people

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.640
should do when they first introduce some, you know, new set of ideas, which is,

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:08.720
can we actually reproduce? Can we make theoretical predictions? Can we reproduce what

01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:14.880
what what has been known before? And can we get out vastly more than we put in? Yes, we put very

01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:19.840
little in. And the question is, do we get all these things out? Or do we have to add some special

01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:25.680
clues to get fermions? Or do fermions come out naturally, as soon as we understand how to get

01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:30.480
there? And the thing which has been remarkable so far is, you know, we've been checking off,

01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:37.840
do we get this, do we get that, do we get that? So far, touch wood, no clues. I mean, so far,

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:43.120
it's been hard work. But nothing has been like, Oh, my gosh, the universe, you know,

01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:47.440
the theory predicts the universe should be 26 dimensional, we have to explain why it's not

01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:52.320
type thing. We haven't had any of those kind of, you know, clues barriers, so to speak.

01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:57.120
So that's encouraging. Now, in terms of actually making specific, measurable predictions,

01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:03.680
a couple of issues. First issue is going from the raw theory, the low level machine code,

01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:07.840
to something where you turn a telescope in that direction, and you see a particular thing.

01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:12.640
There's lots of, you know, there's lots of hard work and lots of astrophysics and so on to be done

01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:19.360
in going from one place to another. That's first point. The second point is that to actually make

01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:25.360
one of the things in our theory is there is one scale. Same happened with Einstein's theory,

01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:29.920
actually. Although, for various reasons that, well, we can talk about that, but there's one scale,

01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:35.520
which is this maximum entanglement speed. We don't know what the value of that is. We have

01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:40.720
some guesses, but we don't know its value. If we knew its value, we would have a whole bunch of

01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:46.080
predictions immediately. But we don't know its value. Einstein had the same problem. He had the

01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:50.960
cosmological constant. He didn't know its value. It's, you know, a lot of predictions he might

01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:54.560
have liked to make. He couldn't make because he didn't know the value of the cosmological constant.

01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:59.360
You know, he had one meta prediction was that the universe wasn't expanding, he thought,

01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:04.160
which is why he added his cosmological constant in the first place. But that's his scale. So then

01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:08.800
he had a few scale independent predictions, in particular, the, you know, the bending of light

01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:12.640
around the sun being a factor of two larger than I've been predicting the previous theory,

01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:17.360
things like that. So one thing that we've been interested in is what scale independent predictions

01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:22.800
can we make? That's question one. And question two, what predictions can we make that are,

01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:29.200
as soon as we know this one scale, we immediately have predictions. And then which predictions can

01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:34.240
we make that have the shortest distance in terms of the tower of astrophysics or particle physics

01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:38.480
or whatever they have to be done. It's a cautionary tale that like Newton, for example, you know,

01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:43.200
he goes through his whole, you know, Principia, and he works out lots of things about his law of

01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:48.000
gravity. And he has a section about the moon. And the section about the moon ends with the

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:52.400
sentence, I think, but the abs of the moon is twice as great. In other words, he got the wrong

01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:57.280
answer. And, you know, one might have said, Oh, my gosh, he got the wrong answer, he better abandon

01:11:57.280 --> 01:12:02.000
the whole theory and run away, so to speak. Turns out it was just hard to do those calculations. It

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:07.120
took another 150 years to get them nailed down. So that wasn't, you know, so one has to be a little

01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:11.440
bit an Einstein also, you know, the first time he computed the bending of light around the sun,

01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:16.880
he got it wrong. And it was, you know, fortunate, the first, you know, experiment that was going

01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:22.320
to be done on that didn't end up getting done because of World War One. And so, you know,

01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:26.080
by the time an experiment did get done, he'd managed to get the right answer, whether the

01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:30.080
experiment was right, it's a different story. But that's, that's another, another thing. But I

01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:35.760
think that the so the question of, you know, do we have kind of scale independent predictions?

01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:41.280
The answer is quite possibly. I think there's one quite likely one that has to do with

01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:46.000
two photon correlations for photons in orbit around rotating black holes,

01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:50.000
is a slightly obscure thing, but it's not completely out of the range of what's

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:55.120
experimentally accessible. Other, I mean, it's kind of amusing that that's so bizarrely similar,

01:12:55.120 --> 01:13:00.640
it's a kind of a quantum analog of Einstein's, you know, bending of light around the sun type thing.

01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:07.600
But, you know, that's one kind of thing. Another thing is a suggestion, at least from the theory,

01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:12.480
about the existence of particles much lighter than the electron, maybe 10 to the 20th times

01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:16.960
lighter than the electron. That number depends on the scale parameter that we don't know.

01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:20.400
The existence of such particles probably has a bunch of implications for dark matter,

01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:27.600
which are things that we're planning to work out. There are a bunch of implications for cosmology.

01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:33.040
I mean, there's an expectation, not a necessary feature, but a suggestion, at least from the model,

01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:37.520
that the universe starts kind of infinite dimensional and only gradually kind of

01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:42.720
decay down to the sort of modest three dimensions that we have now. That has a bunch of implications

01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:47.200
for inflationary scenarios for the universe and so on. You know, I think the most outlandish

01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:52.320
possibility, which I don't think will actually happen, is that still at the time of recombination,

01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:58.400
you know, when your cosmic microwave background globe was minted, so to speak, that there would

01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:04.000
still be a trace of some of the early discrete processes that happened in the very early stages

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:07.840
of the universe. I really doubt that it would have survived that long. But if it did, the absolutely

01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:12.480
outlandish possibility is that the kind of the rule for the universe might be painted in the

01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:16.960
microwave background radiation, which would be truly wrong. I don't think that would happen.

01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:21.600
I think it's very unlikely. But, you know, early density perturbations, there might be some things

01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:28.880
that would be a result of this changing dimensional scenario that's rather different from the traditional

01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:34.400
exponential expansion and four dimensional space, space time of inflationary cosmology.

01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:39.440
That's on the one side. On the particle physics side, and well, one of the things is that it's

01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:46.080
looking very much as if quantum computing at some fundamental level can't work. However,

01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:52.080
seeing that and seeing the actual effects of our theory for decoherence and things like that,

01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:58.400
it's not at all clear that the can't work point is something experimentally accessible.

01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:05.120
And I think that the, you know, it's a question. There's some clever experiment that can be done

01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:11.600
in quantum computing that could see this maximum entanglement speed. That's basically the,

01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:15.280
and we don't know what the value of that speed is, so we can't really tell. What estimate that we

01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:19.680
have of that speed is 10 to the five solar masses per second. If that estimate is correct,

01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:25.120
then it is possible that in black hole, well, it's possible that we'll make small

01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:31.440
effect in a black hole merger of, you know, one and a half solar mass type size would have a bigger

01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:38.480
effect if, you know, two sort of central black holes of two galaxies happen to collide and merge,

01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:42.720
then there will be a bigger effect. It's also conceivable that there might be an effect when

01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:48.320
black holes initially form. And this is an astrophysics question for you, Brian. How long does

01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:54.160
it take a black hole to actually form? Once you have in falling matter, the question is what the

01:15:54.160 --> 01:16:00.160
actual weather in 10 to the minus five seconds, something, whether one can tell what's happening

01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:04.640
in the last 10 to the minus five seconds of the formation of a black hole. If one can,

01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:08.400
and if our estimate of the maximum entanglement speed is right, then there will probably be

01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:11.040
differences from the predictions of general relativity for that case.

01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:17.520
This is a big question, primordial black hole formation, the end of inflation. These are really

01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:21.360
important questions that, you know, it's good to it's good to hear, especially that you're,

01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:24.160
you know, providing potential full employment for my graduate students.

01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:29.200
Yes, there will be lots of work to do in figuring out the consequences of these things. I mean,

01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:33.760
it's a particularly when we get this kind of way of actually doing computations in general

01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:38.240
relativity from our model, set up as a piece of practical numerical relativity, and that that

01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:42.320
will probably happen fairly quickly. We'll actually be able to see a bunch of these effects

01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:47.120
directly in the computations that we do, but there'll be, you know, just layers of astrophysics

01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:55.520
to do. And Eric, I want you to sort of opine on this provocative question that I'm being asked

01:16:55.520 --> 01:17:02.560
in the chat room. And that is, you know, what of what value is a theory if it is not to be

01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:06.160
testable, you know, that which can be claimed without evidence can be dismissed without

01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:10.880
evidence as our friend Christopher Hitchens used to say, I believe. So in the context of

01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:15.840
geometric unity, I'm not asking you to talk about somebody else's book, but talk, talk your own

01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:22.000
book for a second. Are there things that are testable by graduate students in my group or other

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:26.880
brilliant students around the world? Are there predictions? Are there retradictions that are

01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:33.120
crisp enough to, to satisfy Popper A? And do you think we should continue to feed Popper as he had

01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:40.240
enough Pop Pop Pop Popper corn? The first point would be there's a missing layer between you and

01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:48.080
myself. What we do typically Stephen notwithstanding is is that we come up with a classical model

01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:52.800
in the form of some sort of geometry. Hopefully it quantizes itself or something like

01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:59.440
geometric quantization. And then we try to figure out what the testable consequences are in any

01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:05.960
given energy level through a bunch of phenomenologists, experimentalists, and pure quantum field theorists

01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:10.080
working hand-in-hand in our harmonious fashion, at least that's the theory.

01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:14.160
Given that we have a missing layer, there's tons I can say about what's new, what's different,

01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:17.920
and what my theory says, and effectively what would make it wrong.

01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:23.480
So I'm happy to get into that because it effectively says that a lot of our standard

01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:27.800
verbiage around what we've found is in fact wrong.

01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:32.520
So for example, standard thing is the world is chiral, the weak force sees the difference

01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:36.000
between our left hand and our right hand, spiritually speaking.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:40.480
My claim is that the world is not fundamentally chiral, it is emergently chiral, and that

01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:45.720
in fact it begins in a non-chiral fashion which solves the problem that Sabina does

01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:50.520
not see, which is what chooses whether it's going to be the left half or the right half

01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:54.200
effectively that makes up us in some sense.

01:18:54.280 --> 01:19:00.040
Can we already know from neutrino masses that we're not seeing a completely chiral situation?

01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:04.640
We can get into the issue of how to interpret neutrino masses.

01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:08.640
My claim would be that we have entire sectors that we're not seeing.

01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:15.960
So for example, unadorned spin one-half bundles that would be tensored with, if you will,

01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:22.240
the conjugate of the 16-dimensional representation which imparts the particles, their personalities.

01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:26.360
So that is not something that's seen, and I've analogized it, for those of you watching

01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:31.680
at home rather than listening, where you have a hand and you see with three fingers in the

01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:35.880
middle that you think there's a symmetry in the hand, and then you have this problem about

01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:39.800
how do I make my pinky look like my thumb, and you don't realize that there's an entire

01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:44.720
other hand and that it's thumb-to-thumb, and pinky-to-pinky, not pinky-to-thumb, it's the

01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:46.720
symmetry.

01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:51.280
There is a non-chiral world that is emergently chiral, which is fooling us into thinking it's

01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:52.320
fundamentally chiral.

01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:55.480
There are only two generations, not three generations.

01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:58.920
People will immediately say, well, how do you explain the fact that we've seen the tau

01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:04.600
particle in the top and bottom works, and the claim is that is not a generation because

01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:11.120
it will not unify as you heat the soup up in the same way as the first two generations

01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:12.120
will unify.

01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:17.280
In fact, it will unify with another collection of particles, also spin one-half, which I

01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:22.000
believe, if I recall correctly, the thing that will be misinterpreted as an internal

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:26.360
representation, I think will be like 112 dimensional rather than 16.

01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:28.760
There will be no internal representations.

01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:31.240
There will be no internal symmetries.

01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:35.280
This has been a huge trip up for things like supersymmetry, where we keep looking for these

01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:42.280
super partners, which I've analogized a little bit to what happens if you're convinced that

01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:49.280
Spiderman should be, in fact, Clark Kent, should be accompanied by Clark Kent, and Peter Parker

01:20:49.880 --> 01:20:52.200
should be accompanied by Superman.

01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:53.280
We have this wrong.

01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:57.000
There is no internal symmetry, nor should you expect internal symmetry, because this comes

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:03.720
out of two fundamental origin stories, one for the spacetime manifold, another for effectively

01:21:03.720 --> 01:21:08.960
the y-axis above that as the x-axis.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:13.440
We decide that somehow we have spacetime and Einstein, and then somehow we get this thing

01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:19.280
called SU3 cross SU2 cross U1 that falls out of the sky, which is a second origin story.

01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:20.640
There is not two origin stories.

01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:21.640
There is one.

01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:25.320
Einstein, I believe, one of the problems, Stephen, I'm going to say, is that we have

01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:31.160
been in a very difficult position relative to Einstein, because unlike anyone else, because

01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:37.120
of the thought experiments, we have a reverence for not only what he gave us in terms of equations,

01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:41.920
but also how he thought the beautiful humanity that he imparted to everyone, so we don't

01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:43.520
want to harm him in any way.

01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:48.720
It's also the fact that he was wrong, and he was wrong in an interesting way, in the

01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:52.920
same way I believe that Newton was wrong, and we souped up Newton with Einstein, but

01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:57.320
that physics is taking place, in my opinion, on two separate spaces.

01:21:57.320 --> 01:22:03.320
You can call x and y, or Brian, I've joked with you, calling it Harris and Hushamai,

01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:06.040
the heaven and the earth.

01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:11.360
In these two spaces, there is a map between, and that is the map that, in fact, Einstein

01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:15.600
started playing with, but he did not think to pull back the information from space two

01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:18.880
onto space one, from space x to space y.

01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:24.040
I believe that there is a deformation complex, which in the Euclidean signature is elliptic,

01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:29.080
which in fact tells us why the self-dual equations and the Tren Simons-Gabe's theory that were

01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:32.960
studied in the late 70s, early 80s, are so important.

01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:38.240
In fact, it was a special example of a much more general structure, comes out of geometric

01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:39.240
unity.

01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:42.680
That there is not two kinds of geometry in this situation.

01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:48.640
One Riemannian geometry underlying general relativity, an Erismanian geometry of fiber

01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:50.960
bundles underlying the standard model.

01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:54.920
There is, in fact, one geometry, and that one geometry is why it's called geometric

01:22:54.920 --> 01:23:00.360
unity, and it has to do with the difficulty of a lie that we tell in general relativity,

01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:04.720
which is that we say that it is a so-called gauge theory, where we try to get the gauge

01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:09.560
group to be something called the diffeomorphism group, or general coordinate variance.

01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:14.000
We allow it to act on the space of metrics, whereas in the case of the standard model,

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:19.720
we have a space, not of metrics, but of derivative operators from calculus called connections,

01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:22.040
and the group we have is the gauge group.

01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:26.400
The gauge group is an infinite dimensional beast that acts on the space of connection.

01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:31.920
We do not understand, in fact, that telling this lie to make general relativity look like

01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:36.520
a gauge theory, in fact, block progress, and that we should treat it as an honest gauge

01:23:36.520 --> 01:23:37.520
theory.

01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:41.360
We are going to have to recognize that the cosmological constant is not constant.

01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:48.040
It is a field which acquires a BEV, or a vacuum expectation value, as it is lured away by topological

01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:49.040
mechanisms.

01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:52.000
We are going to see that we got the Lorentz group wrong.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.640
We focused on the Lorentz group when we meant to be focusing on the gauge group.

01:23:55.640 --> 01:23:59.680
We formed its inhomogeneous extension called the Poincare group.

01:23:59.680 --> 01:24:05.760
In fact, you're supposed to extend it by something called ad-valued one-forms to create, effectively,

01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:08.120
the inhomogeneous gauge group.

01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:12.400
That is the object on which you're supposed to do supersymmetric analysis.

01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:14.960
Our concept of supersymmetry is wrong.

01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:17.880
In effect, we're acting on the wrong group.

01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:22.800
We've chosen Minkowski space as the naturally occurring affine space that is not the right

01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:23.800
place to be playing.

01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:26.760
The right place to be playing is the space of connection.

01:24:26.760 --> 01:24:32.400
There's a huge number of things I can tell you about the missing matter.

01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:40.760
What in our sector, its SU3 cross SU2 cross U1 internal quantum numbers will be 16 new

01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:46.240
particles that are spin 3 halves with conjugate internal quantum numbers.

01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:52.360
The same thing as our usual 16 dimensional representation, but the complex conjugate thereof,

01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:59.360
which we have not seen yet, and explaining why the illusion of three generations is generated

01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:05.840
by what would be called branching rules with respect to Lie algebra and Lie group representation

01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:06.840
decomposition.

01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:09.680
Yes, I can tell you a bunch of new particles.

01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:14.960
I can tell you about non-kirality, the number of generations, how Einstein is wrong, what

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:19.520
spaces we're supposed to be doing this on, and then there's a question about, okay, well,

01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:21.520
what can you tell us about the accelerators?

01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:25.400
By the way, this is all subject to, if my theory is correct, but it gets boring to say

01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:28.040
if my theory is correct over and over again.

01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:32.880
There should just be a general caveat that all of this assumes geometric unity is in fact

01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:33.880
correct.

01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:39.800
Yes, there's a ton of specificity, and Brian, I'm looking forward to coming down to UCSD

01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:40.800
and actually doing it.

01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:41.800
Let me just say something.

01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:47.480
I've been very pissed off about this claim that what I'm talking about, different from

01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:53.120
what Dr. Wolfram is talking about, is so impenetrable and difficult.

01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:59.640
It really has to do with the sickness in our field that our field just isn't interested

01:25:59.640 --> 01:26:02.040
in some sense because it doesn't believe.

01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:07.280
We all know that the problems have gotten so difficult and so hard, and so many smart

01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:12.720
people have been over them, that a sense of learned helplessness has invaded the field,

01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:14.160
which we have to talk about.

01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:18.920
People no longer feel like they're actual physicists that can connect to Schrodinger

01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:22.800
or Heisenberg or Dirac or Einstein or Planck.

01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:28.120
People don't even feel like Weinberg and Yang were still with us, or in some sense,

01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:32.320
nobody's gone to, I see, losing the Nobel Prize at Brian's shoulder.

01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:39.920
Nobody's gone to Stockholm for advances in fundamental physical theory, since the theories

01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:42.520
put forward since the early 1970s.

01:26:42.520 --> 01:26:44.120
I think that's a correct statement.

01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:51.680
All the people who've contributed to the fundamental canon are either dead or septigenarians or

01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:53.920
higher, I think.

01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:57.680
Maybe Frank Wilczek was born in 1951, is at the end of the 60s.

01:26:57.680 --> 01:27:02.800
We have to recognize that this sense that it is impossible has caused lots of us to

01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:07.600
start faking it and to start calculating what we need to do for our careers rather than

01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:12.640
how to actually advance the science, which is one reason that both Stephen and I are

01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:18.720
viewed as incredibly brash, effectively too brusque, maybe too arrogant.

01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:23.960
The answer, I believe, is that we have to drive this field out of its sense that it's

01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:26.360
playing at physics rather than doing physics.

01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:28.440
It's talking around physics.

01:27:28.440 --> 01:27:31.760
One of the things I want to do on these live streams is I want to actually talk about the

01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:36.520
meat of the theories and let people scurry to Wikipedia or help each other out to try

01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:40.200
to understand what is said rather than make it an enjoyable product for everybody.

01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:41.200
I agree.

01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:42.200
I agree.

01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:45.040
But Stephen has said earlier, this is simple.

01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:46.040
It's not easy.

01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:48.840
It's not trivial.

01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:53.400
My nine-year-old, who you'll meet someday, hopefully both of you guys, he can play around

01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:54.960
with rule 30.

01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:56.240
He can get stimulated.

01:27:56.240 --> 01:27:58.240
He can engage with it.

01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:04.720
So when you say that it's not difficult, I don't agree that there's a character class

01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:08.160
that differentiates, and I'm not pitting it one against another.

01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:12.440
For certain, there are more complicated models than even Eric's, in my opinion.

01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:13.440
Wait, wait.

01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:14.440
How is my model complicated?

01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:15.920
I'm just a simple experimentalist.

01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:22.200
Fourteen-dimensional dual spaces, and look, if it's too complicated for Sabina to understand,

01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:23.400
I think our general...

01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:24.400
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:27.360
This is just unfair, and I want to be very clear about it.

01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:30.520
If you talk about general relativity, which Stephen has been talking about throughout

01:28:30.520 --> 01:28:36.120
our live stream, he's talking about the idea that you have a space, call it X, and it has

01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:37.520
a metric on it.

01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:43.120
And that metric is a map into the space of all possible metrics, call that Y.

01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:46.520
That X and that Y are where geometric unity lives.

01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:50.600
So with all due respect to Sabina and her, I can't understand anything.

01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:51.800
It's also complicated.

01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:57.640
You've got to map between the chronospacetime and the space of metrics.

01:28:57.640 --> 01:29:02.920
That Romani metric is simply a map between two topological spaces.

01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:04.400
It's not that complicated.

01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:05.400
I don't...

01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:06.400
Brian, it's just not true.

01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:07.400
Okay.

01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:08.400
Let's move on, actually.

01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:09.400
I want to make a few comments about...

01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:10.400
Okay, Stephen, go ahead.

01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:11.800
So maybe people will find interesting.

01:29:11.800 --> 01:29:17.360
I mean, so, you know, maps between topological spaces, diffeomorphisms, these kinds of ideas.

01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:21.320
But, you know, I happened to learn these ideas when I was a kid.

01:29:21.320 --> 01:29:23.160
Most people don't.

01:29:23.160 --> 01:29:24.840
These are fairly...

01:29:24.840 --> 01:29:31.680
Most people learn those ideas in, I don't know, mid-math college, if they go to a fancy

01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:34.840
college, maybe math, graduate school, those kinds of things.

01:29:34.840 --> 01:29:37.360
They happen to be fairly complicated.

01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:42.560
There are fields of science where people can contribute without having gone to graduate

01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:43.560
school.

01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:45.600
There are other fields where they can't contribute very much.

01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:47.800
We see that in people.

01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:53.000
One of the great things about kind of some of these computational areas of science is

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:58.840
that because it's kind of, you know, because it's very new territory, it's possible for

01:29:58.840 --> 01:30:02.280
people to contribute without having kind of gone to graduate school and learned a whole

01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:04.360
big stack of concepts.

01:30:04.360 --> 01:30:09.000
One of the things, you know, I get pretty much every day, you know, a theory of physics

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.000
from somebody.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:14.800
Eric's version is, you know, he went to Harvard and got a PhD in mathematical physics.

01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:19.440
So his version is much better dressed than most of the versions that I see.

01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:20.440
Okay?

01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:25.000
And most of the versions that I see are, you know, I find it disappointing because it feels

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:29.000
like people are, you know, writing poetry that nobody's going to read and they're doing

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:32.280
it using kind of high school level physics knowledge.

01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:33.280
It's mostly cranks.

01:30:33.280 --> 01:30:36.640
People who may be well-meaning, but they don't realize that they're way out of their

01:30:36.640 --> 01:30:37.640
depth.

01:30:37.640 --> 01:30:38.640
Yeah.

01:30:38.640 --> 01:30:39.640
Right.

01:30:39.640 --> 01:30:42.920
But the main thing is that they don't know what got done in the 20th century in physics.

01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:47.920
What got done in the 20th century in physics requires kind of graduate school level knowledge

01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:49.640
to understand.

01:30:49.640 --> 01:30:51.840
And we can say it isn't true, but it is true.

01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:55.920
I mean, it's, you know, general relativity and quantum field theory, you know, Eric

01:30:55.920 --> 01:30:57.320
may say they're simple theories.

01:30:57.320 --> 01:31:01.480
I think they're kind of simple theories, but that's because I learned about them when

01:31:01.480 --> 01:31:05.840
I was, I don't know, 12, 13 years old and by now they seem like simple theories.

01:31:05.840 --> 01:31:09.880
And if it's simple to you or if it's even marginally complex to Stephen, what, what

01:31:09.880 --> 01:31:10.880
helped?

01:31:10.920 --> 01:31:16.600
So just the whole language of talking about things, you know, this is kind of math, graduate

01:31:16.600 --> 01:31:18.320
school type language.

01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:24.480
And that's, now, is there a way to state these things about fiber bundles and so on without

01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:26.200
sort of super fancy language?

01:31:26.200 --> 01:31:27.760
Quite possibly.

01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:31.240
Maybe some of the things we're trying to do will give away to do that.

01:31:31.240 --> 01:31:33.960
And that's part of the hope of just bringing your communities together.

01:31:33.960 --> 01:31:36.160
Let me move on just because we don't know much time.

01:31:36.160 --> 01:31:38.080
You guys are very gracious with your time.

01:31:38.080 --> 01:31:39.080
I want to respect it.

01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:40.240
And I have kids to put to bed.

01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:44.320
And I do want to ask the following question that my audience is asking when we think about

01:31:44.320 --> 01:31:46.560
the power of these different approaches.

01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:48.560
Let's take a step away from either one of yours.

01:31:48.560 --> 01:31:54.480
There's been a lot made about artificial intelligence and the prospects for as Max Tegmark has put

01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:57.760
it, you know, an artificial physicist and artificial Galileo.

01:31:57.760 --> 01:32:00.960
What role do you guys see artificial intelligence playing?

01:32:00.960 --> 01:32:02.320
And then you know where I'm going next.

01:32:02.320 --> 01:32:05.920
I know that you guys know I'm going to the simulation hypothesis.

01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:09.680
And I've talked to you guys individually, maybe offline about this, but the audience

01:32:09.680 --> 01:32:16.560
is very keen to know your two esteemed gentlemen, what you think about the prospects for AI and

01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:18.160
as a benefit to physics.

01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:20.160
And then later we'll ask about the simulation hypothesis.

01:32:20.160 --> 01:32:21.760
Let me start with Steven, please.

01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:26.280
I mean, I've worked on what is now called AI for about 40 something years.

01:32:26.280 --> 01:32:28.240
So I know a tiny bit about it.

01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:30.280
A lot of, I don't know, I don't know where to start.

01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:34.640
I mean, if you're talking about machine learning, if you're talking about, oh, let's sort of

01:32:34.640 --> 01:32:38.600
throw everything we know about physics into a machine learning system and see whether it

01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:40.240
can figure out the laws of physics.

01:32:40.240 --> 01:32:41.160
That's one level.

01:32:41.160 --> 01:32:41.960
Yeah, that's one level.

01:32:41.960 --> 01:32:46.080
Noam Chomsky, who was on my show and said, you know, he has, he's sanguine about what

01:32:46.080 --> 01:32:51.240
you just described, perhaps as his max tag mark, but the true creative stroke, he has

01:32:51.240 --> 01:32:56.760
no, you know, the kind of it's a little bit complicated because in, you know, computational

01:32:56.760 --> 01:33:03.760
irreducibility tells us that we can know the rules for something, but have no way to kind

01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:07.240
of have a large scale narrative for how the thing happens.

01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:09.960
So in other words, we might say, yes, we've succeeded.

01:33:09.960 --> 01:33:12.240
We found rules that reproduce physics.

01:33:12.880 --> 01:33:14.840
You say, well, tell me how they work.

01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:16.360
You say, well, here are the rules.

01:33:16.640 --> 01:33:19.000
But you say, well, tell me a story about how they work.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.920
Tell me a high level, you know, version of how they work.

01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:23.840
That may not be possible.

01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:29.320
I mean, for example, in linguistics, picking on, on Noam Chomsky's area, you know, we may

01:33:29.320 --> 01:33:35.080
have a description of how brains work and how brains process language at a sort of

01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:37.600
microscopic computational level.

01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:40.680
And we may still, and it may be completely accurate.

01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:45.160
And we may still not have anything we would call a satisfactory science of linguistics.

01:33:45.960 --> 01:33:49.080
So in other words, it's a, it's a slightly complicated thing.

01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:53.640
And the question of whether, you know, whether we can get a current, you know, machine learning

01:33:53.640 --> 01:33:58.840
system to reverse engineer the laws of physics, you know, to some extent, you can do that to

01:33:58.840 --> 01:34:02.040
a fantastic extent of, of figuring out everything.

01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:02.960
You won't be able to do that.

01:34:02.960 --> 01:34:08.120
I don't think and, and, you know, the challenge, again, we keep on coming at things at really

01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:15.160
weird angles, but there's a, you know, okay, the way I see it, there's kind of what's possible

01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:18.200
in the computational universe, what simple programs can do.

01:34:18.480 --> 01:34:20.920
There's this kind of ocean of computational possibility.

01:34:21.280 --> 01:34:23.480
There's what we humans understand.

01:34:24.120 --> 01:34:26.720
That's another kind of piece.

01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:29.320
And there's also what the physical universe does.

01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:34.080
And, you know, I've spent a large part of my life trying to bridge between the sort of

01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:38.440
ocean of computational possibility and what we humans understand, that's the whole sort

01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:45.120
of point of the computational language I've built is to have a way to have humans be able

01:34:45.120 --> 01:34:51.200
to think about things computationally and be able to communicate what they want in a

01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:52.400
computational fashion.

01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:55.480
Now we have the sort of third piece of physics.

01:34:55.800 --> 01:35:01.080
And the question is how we describe, you know, how we make this bridge between sort of the

01:35:01.080 --> 01:35:07.280
physical universe, doing what it does, our ability to tell a narrative about what's going

01:35:07.280 --> 01:35:12.680
on, and this kind of computation in the middle as this kind of mediator of those two things.

01:35:12.680 --> 01:35:15.160
But I mean, this is, it's a mess.

01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:19.560
I would say that there's a, there's a, I mean, this is a longer discussion.

01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:22.440
And I think there's probably the wrong angle to come at it with.

01:35:22.640 --> 01:35:27.520
If you say, are we going to have a, a, you know, a magic thing that we can throw stuff

01:35:27.520 --> 01:35:29.680
into and get out the theory of physics?

01:35:30.120 --> 01:35:30.960
Well, I doubt it.

01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:34.000
You know, you talked about the simulation argument, I might, I always find it kind of

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:37.760
charming that people say, you know, I'm an atheist.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:39.280
I believe in science.

01:35:40.040 --> 01:35:45.480
You know, what I believe is that, you know, there's this, we're in this universe and this

01:35:45.480 --> 01:35:51.600
universe is actually a simulation operated by operated by the universe.

01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:53.840
But I'm an atheist.

01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:54.480
Exactly.

01:35:54.480 --> 01:35:54.800
Right.

01:35:54.800 --> 01:35:57.400
And then all the morality that entails therein.

01:35:57.400 --> 01:35:57.680
Yes.

01:35:57.680 --> 01:35:58.040
Right.

01:35:58.040 --> 01:36:02.520
But, but I think that the, more seriously, I think that that sort of argument is kind

01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:07.840
of philosophically doomed because by the time you have definite laws for physics, there

01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:10.560
isn't much for the God to do, so to speak.

01:36:10.680 --> 01:36:14.640
Now, the only thing you might say is, but the God gets to pick the laws of physics,

01:36:15.240 --> 01:36:20.680
except that we now seem to have found that it actually doesn't matter what the laws

01:36:20.680 --> 01:36:25.720
of physics are, that in some sense, in this kind of, again, for reasons that again, this

01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:27.160
is a slightly longer story.

01:36:27.160 --> 01:36:32.920
But what matters is that we are observing physics in a certain way, and that's what

01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:35.880
gives us the laws that we believe to be laws of physics.

01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:40.120
And there really isn't, in a sense, there's nothing for the, for the God to do other

01:36:40.120 --> 01:36:46.840
than to decide that our universe is going to be computational, not hyper computational,

01:36:47.160 --> 01:36:48.960
not below computational.

01:36:49.080 --> 01:36:55.920
And even if those other sort of kind of conceptual universes exist, we, you know,

01:36:55.920 --> 01:37:00.600
again, it's a matter of science to be able to say that we simply can't communicate with them.

01:37:00.600 --> 01:37:05.400
They're simply, they're just not things which are in any way connected to what we can perceive.

01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:10.440
So I think it's a, it's a, I do like the idea, though, that there's a connection between sort

01:37:10.440 --> 01:37:13.160
of AI physics and the simulation argument.

01:37:13.160 --> 01:37:17.080
I think that's a, that's a, that's an interesting and bizarre connection, which,

01:37:17.080 --> 01:37:19.240
which I think would be fun to unpack some more.

01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:22.680
And Eric, you want to opine on this or would you, yeah, go ahead.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:29.080
I don't really know whether it even requires AI and, or AGI.

01:37:29.480 --> 01:37:35.000
There's a particular kind of move that we haven't programmed into computers yet,

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:36.040
so far as I'm aware.

01:37:36.040 --> 01:37:41.240
Now, Stephen probably knows this much better than I do, but there's a weird move that comes

01:37:41.240 --> 01:37:47.640
up over and over again, which has to do with reaching for something outside of your model

01:37:47.640 --> 01:37:49.240
and knowing what to reach for.

01:37:49.240 --> 01:37:55.320
So for example, you have a problem with the weak interactions that a new neutron when it decays

01:37:55.320 --> 01:38:01.320
into a proton and an electron called beta decay doesn't seem to have enough energy in the final

01:38:01.320 --> 01:38:05.080
products to conserve energy from the initial products.

01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:07.000
So Pauli had to.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:07.480
Oh yeah.

01:38:07.480 --> 01:38:08.040
Okay.

01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:09.720
You're explaining how new tree knows come to be.

01:38:09.720 --> 01:38:09.880
Yeah.

01:38:09.880 --> 01:38:10.120
Okay.

01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:10.440
Fine.

01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:10.680
Yes.

01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:11.000
Right.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.320
Because it's like one of the most important stories we have.

01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:14.120
Not everybody knows it.

01:38:14.760 --> 01:38:20.680
You have a problem that you've got three lines coming into a point and there's a failure of

01:38:20.680 --> 01:38:22.040
conservation of momentum.

01:38:22.040 --> 01:38:25.080
And so you have to hypothesize a fourth line.

01:38:25.080 --> 01:38:29.800
You had a different problem when Dirac came out with his theory, which is, is that he only had

01:38:29.800 --> 01:38:32.600
the electron and the proton, they were oppositely charged.

01:38:32.600 --> 01:38:35.640
So we decided that one was the antiparticle of the other.

01:38:35.640 --> 01:38:40.680
Instead, this is the part, you know, similar to the Peter Parker-Clarke-Kent issue,

01:38:40.680 --> 01:38:45.400
he should have hypothesized a positron to be the anti-electron, to be the anti-electron

01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:49.080
and an antiproton to be the antiparticle of the familiar proton.

01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:51.240
That move was too much.

01:38:51.240 --> 01:38:53.720
And in fact, Heisenberg chastised it.

01:38:53.720 --> 01:38:57.800
There's an issue about understanding how spin comes about.

01:38:57.800 --> 01:39:02.760
So effectively, when I've said that the square root is the psychedelic of mathematics,

01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:09.000
you have to give your computer program psychedelics effectively so that it can invent new stuff.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:14.760
That is, I can join something called i or i, j and k to solve a problem that was posed in the

01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:15.320
real numbers.

01:39:15.320 --> 01:39:18.680
And then I get the quaternions with complex numbers or even the actonians.

01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:24.120
I'm going to augment my theory of something called differential forms to something called

01:39:24.120 --> 01:39:25.480
the theory of spinners.

01:39:25.480 --> 01:39:30.120
Can you discover something called the fofian, which is the square root of the determinant

01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:32.120
for a particular class of matrices?

01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:36.040
Can you discover that the Euler class is in a certain sense the square root of something

01:39:36.040 --> 01:39:37.800
called the Pontriagin class?

01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:43.960
All of these things are these non-trivial moves where something that is not present in

01:39:43.960 --> 01:39:51.080
the initial formulation is guessable as the thing that would be needed to complete the

01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:55.320
stuff that we can see with stuff that we can't to get a consistent system.

01:39:56.120 --> 01:40:02.440
If you can teach a computer about primitives and give it the ability to guess outside of

01:40:02.440 --> 01:40:06.360
the system that you've taught it so that it can self-adjoin.

01:40:06.440 --> 01:40:09.320
And I don't see any impediment to this currently.

01:40:09.320 --> 01:40:14.440
You would have a system that would be potent enough to explore not only the theory that

01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:18.600
you feed it, but the theories that it can build from that theory.

01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:22.840
And in essence, the computer program is being asked to do something similar than what we're

01:40:22.840 --> 01:40:24.840
asking theoretical physics to do.

01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:29.000
Again, everybody complains about how complicated this is and I'm sick and tired and bored of

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:29.880
hearing it.

01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:30.840
Steven's correct.

01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:35.080
You do have to learn some level of mathematics.

01:40:35.080 --> 01:40:39.560
Typically, this would be somewhat like learning the French language before exploring French

01:40:39.560 --> 01:40:40.040
literature.

01:40:40.920 --> 01:40:42.840
Yeah, it's expensive.

01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:44.840
If you want to learn a foreign language, it costs money.

01:40:45.400 --> 01:40:49.640
In time, same thing for learning differential geometry in quantum field theory.

01:40:49.640 --> 01:40:56.360
The situation that we're facing is that your computer program has to be capable of building

01:40:56.360 --> 01:41:01.880
larger worlds by adjoining things that would make puzzles in the worlds that it knows about

01:41:01.880 --> 01:41:02.680
make sense.

01:41:02.680 --> 01:41:08.600
And that process of inferential guessing outside of anything that's been taught is a different

01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:13.880
problem than the problem of finding, let's say, chess moves or go moves by being able to search

01:41:13.880 --> 01:41:17.000
a larger space where the search space is implicit in the rules.

01:41:17.640 --> 01:41:20.120
So do I believe that it requires AGI?

01:41:20.120 --> 01:41:26.120
Now, one of the stories that I don't think we talk that much about is how much we thought AGI or

01:41:26.120 --> 01:41:30.760
artificial general intelligence would be needed to do all sorts of things.

01:41:30.760 --> 01:41:35.000
And the great surprise is we don't need anything like artificial general intelligence

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:38.600
to do most of the things that supposedly intelligence systems now do.

01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:44.440
We thought that AGI and our consciousness and our intelligence was necessary.

01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:47.320
It turns out that much less is usually necessary.

01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:51.880
It is entirely possible that we don't need to wait around and we can have the computers guess it.

01:41:51.880 --> 01:41:58.600
And to the issue of atheism and the simulators and the simulated, we have two separate stories,

01:41:58.600 --> 01:42:05.160
one story in which we are going to build the intelligence, the AGI fear, which it's going

01:42:05.160 --> 01:42:06.360
to be smarter than us.

01:42:06.360 --> 01:42:11.000
We have another one in which we are the simulated and there's the simulated tour somewhere else.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:17.160
If you put the two stories together, you see that in a weird way, God should be scared about us

01:42:17.160 --> 01:42:20.680
becoming intelligence when we finally learn what our source code is.

01:42:20.680 --> 01:42:23.560
This is the moment where Skynet becomes self-aware.

01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:26.760
And the thing that nobody sees coming is that we are the AI.

01:42:26.760 --> 01:42:30.120
We are the AGI that emerged in somebody else's system.

01:42:30.120 --> 01:42:33.880
And whether or not that somebody else was sentient or not is a different question.

01:42:33.880 --> 01:42:35.400
But Einstein asked this thing.

01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:38.280
He said, I don't care about the spectrum or this or that element.

01:42:38.280 --> 01:42:42.840
What really bothers me is whether or not the creator had any choice or what interests me

01:42:42.840 --> 01:42:45.800
is whether the creator had any choice in the way the world was made.

01:42:45.800 --> 01:42:50.440
This is an interesting concept of not being all powerful, but being all constrained.

01:42:51.080 --> 01:42:56.760
And perhaps the creator's sole function, if you will, is to turn on the lights.

01:42:56.760 --> 01:42:58.600
And everything else follows from that.

01:42:58.600 --> 01:43:05.160
This is sort of a Leibnizian monad construction where the idea is that the rules effectively

01:43:05.160 --> 01:43:09.000
tell us what is going to happen and there's very little room for anything else.

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:14.680
But I think that part of the reason we keep asking these questions is to be blunt pessimism.

01:43:14.680 --> 01:43:19.160
Rather than working on the actually hard stuff, either in Stephen's case of trying to do it

01:43:19.160 --> 01:43:24.520
through computation or my case of trying to remain within the standard mathematical tool kit.

01:43:24.520 --> 01:43:29.320
People are so frustrated that we waste our lives talking about the mathematical universe

01:43:29.320 --> 01:43:32.040
hypothesis, the simulation hypothesis.

01:43:32.040 --> 01:43:37.000
We do all sorts of nonsensical work on theories that have nothing to do with physical reality.

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:42.920
And I just think it would be better if we stopped wasting our time talking around physics

01:43:42.920 --> 01:43:44.520
and started talking about physics itself.

01:43:44.520 --> 01:43:46.360
Well, guys, I have to go.

01:43:47.080 --> 01:43:49.000
You guys have been so generous with your time.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.640
You've answered a lot of questions that the audience had.

01:43:51.640 --> 01:43:57.000
And for that, I'm very thankful from both coasts.

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:58.760
Any final words, Stephen?

01:43:58.760 --> 01:44:03.000
I did think there was going to be one question you wanted to ask us about peer review

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.400
and our attitudes towards it, which I think people are going to want to know.

01:44:05.400 --> 01:44:07.000
I think we should wrap it up.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:11.880
Maybe we'll take that up on a future podcast with you guys individually.

01:44:11.880 --> 01:44:17.400
The time has really come to go, or I'll be in a lot of trouble with a multiverse of children

01:44:17.400 --> 01:44:18.200
screaming at me.

01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:23.000
Stephen, anything you'd like to leave the audience with, any way that they can engage

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:26.920
and perhaps participate in the exciting work of Wolfram Research?

01:44:26.920 --> 01:44:28.680
Use Wolfram Language, use Wolfram Alpha.

01:44:29.880 --> 01:44:34.280
You can come to live streams we do frequently about the physics project.

01:44:34.280 --> 01:44:36.360
You can look at the physics website.

01:44:36.360 --> 01:44:40.440
You'll find all of the programs and things there.

01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:44.520
It seems like people are finding this stuff, which is great.

01:44:44.520 --> 01:44:48.760
And we'll put a link to the YouTube channel where folks can find your many, many live streams

01:44:48.760 --> 01:44:50.280
and presentations as well.

01:44:50.280 --> 01:44:54.280
Eric, something for closeout, where can people find you and engage with you?

01:44:54.280 --> 01:44:55.560
Come find us at the portal.

01:44:55.560 --> 01:44:59.160
I think there's also an Eric Weinstein.org.

01:44:59.160 --> 01:45:03.960
Look for the Geometric Unity presentation, which was a special presentation within the

01:45:03.960 --> 01:45:04.840
Portal series.

01:45:04.840 --> 01:45:11.160
I am looking forward to hosting Stephen getting into the thick of his theory and how it works.

01:45:11.160 --> 01:45:15.960
I think that one of the things that people should get engaged with is both why people

01:45:15.960 --> 01:45:19.240
are so pessimistic and negative about every new emergence.

01:45:19.240 --> 01:45:23.400
You should learn about the no-go theorems and all of the things that a theory would have to fit.

01:45:23.400 --> 01:45:24.920
I don't think people are particularly negative.

01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:27.720
I mean, honestly, we've been playing up the negativism.

01:45:27.720 --> 01:45:33.480
But honestly, what I'm seeing is people being very enthusiastic about what we're doing.

01:45:34.280 --> 01:45:36.840
So far, I haven't seen anybody.

01:45:36.840 --> 01:45:42.840
I'd be interested to hear from somebody credible who says, I mean, you've said,

01:45:42.840 --> 01:45:43.880
I don't believe your theory.

01:45:43.880 --> 01:45:45.560
Wait a second.

01:45:47.400 --> 01:45:54.040
No, I believe that your theory is either going to reproduce a lot of what it is that we already

01:45:54.040 --> 01:45:55.960
know and then tell us something new potentially.

01:45:57.480 --> 01:45:58.680
I'm not disagreeing with it.

01:45:58.680 --> 01:46:01.960
I've said that it might be a face up to some common subject.

01:46:01.960 --> 01:46:03.560
It's certainly not the face that I'm taking.

01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:08.760
We should hash that out when we do each other's podcasts.

01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:13.160
The issue that I wanted to get to, though, is, yeah, there is a lot of negativity.

01:46:13.160 --> 01:46:14.920
You can read about it in the Reddit comments.

01:46:14.920 --> 01:46:18.440
You can read about it very often left in the YouTube comments.

01:46:18.440 --> 01:46:20.520
Some people in the field are very disgruntled.

01:46:20.520 --> 01:46:23.400
Very few people have wanted to say, I've waited in.

01:46:23.400 --> 01:46:24.760
I've tried to look at it.

01:46:24.760 --> 01:46:26.280
I've really kind of to understand it.

01:46:26.280 --> 01:46:28.440
And I still think these guys are talking crap.

01:46:28.440 --> 01:46:35.000
I think Steven's exactly right that the coincidence of his work and my work being on the same show,

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
I don't see any need to fit them together.

01:46:38.840 --> 01:46:42.040
And I think that if they're both right, then they would have to be fit together.

01:46:42.040 --> 01:46:46.120
And most probably, of course, they're both wrong because that we have to say these words.

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:53.880
With that said, get excited about people who are trying to find ways out of the learned

01:46:53.880 --> 01:46:58.840
helplessness that comes out of the no-go theorems, the pessimism that came out of the LHC.

01:46:59.560 --> 01:47:00.600
I disagree with Steven.

01:47:00.600 --> 01:47:06.680
I still think that there is a core community that's angry that people outside are speaking to the world

01:47:06.680 --> 01:47:07.160
through this direction.

01:47:07.160 --> 01:47:07.960
They may be angry about you.

01:47:07.960 --> 01:47:10.600
I don't think they're very angry about me, at least not that.

01:47:10.600 --> 01:47:11.080
Yeah, maybe they were.

01:47:11.080 --> 01:47:12.040
There is pessimism.

01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:13.720
I think Eric's talking specifically.

01:47:13.720 --> 01:47:16.920
I guarantee you there are people angry about you too, Steven.

01:47:16.920 --> 01:47:18.520
It's not just about me.

01:47:18.520 --> 01:47:23.880
It's in general that we're all up against a question where nobody has any precedent.

01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:28.120
I think people have one thing that I think is the case is that what I've noticed,

01:47:28.120 --> 01:47:31.560
for example, about peer review, which we're not going to talk about here in detail,

01:47:31.560 --> 01:47:36.680
but it's the people who say peer review is amazing.

01:47:36.680 --> 01:47:40.520
We need peer review on not people inside science.

01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:44.920
They're not people who actually know it up close because up close, it's actually people.

01:47:44.920 --> 01:47:46.360
In fact, one thing's kind of amusing.

01:47:46.360 --> 01:47:51.320
We set up a peer review system for our project and to date,

01:47:51.320 --> 01:47:54.520
not a single person has submitted a peer review.

01:47:54.520 --> 01:47:55.320
Not a single person.

01:47:55.320 --> 01:47:56.600
It's been several months now.

01:47:56.600 --> 01:48:00.200
How can people submit reviews of it?

01:48:00.200 --> 01:48:02.360
It just says there's just a link that says peer review.

01:48:02.360 --> 01:48:04.920
It's next to each one of our documents.

01:48:04.920 --> 01:48:06.120
I encourage people to do it.

01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:07.720
I mean, honestly, I'm disappointed.

01:48:07.720 --> 01:48:11.720
I thought at least a few people would do it, even if they were like,

01:48:11.720 --> 01:48:13.880
I didn't really read this, but it's all nonsense anyway.

01:48:14.760 --> 01:48:18.840
But what we actually asked for, more specifically, which I think is useful,

01:48:18.840 --> 01:48:24.360
is somebody to say, I read section 3.7, and I think it's correct,

01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:26.600
or I think there's this mistake in it or whatever else.

01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:29.640
We have had people like Sabine Hossenfeldt, an eminent scientist,

01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:33.080
and she's written a video, which is the first time you guys appeared together,

01:48:33.080 --> 01:48:34.920
where she criticizes these theories.

01:48:34.920 --> 01:48:37.560
And she's an eminent fundamental theorist.

01:48:37.560 --> 01:48:40.120
We've been an email correspondence with her,

01:48:40.120 --> 01:48:43.240
and she asked a bunch of questions, which were very valid questions.

01:48:43.240 --> 01:48:48.200
So we gave her answers, and she disappeared.

01:48:48.760 --> 01:48:53.240
So if she's still saying she doesn't know what's going on, then there's a problem.

01:48:53.880 --> 01:48:56.520
Well, the fact is, is that you've answered her questions.

01:48:56.520 --> 01:48:59.880
She had questions that were reasonable, and that's the beginning of the process.

01:48:59.880 --> 01:49:03.080
Then if she continues to say, well, he hasn't answered my questions

01:49:03.080 --> 01:49:05.400
after he's answered the questions, and she hasn't responded,

01:49:05.400 --> 01:49:06.520
then we're in a different situation.

01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:07.080
Yeah, then we can actually-

01:49:07.080 --> 01:49:11.800
I know Sabine can be kind of gruff and unpleasant,

01:49:11.800 --> 01:49:15.480
but I know her to be reasonably fair in most circumstances.

01:49:15.480 --> 01:49:17.160
Very good. Thank you guys.

01:49:17.160 --> 01:49:19.960
You guys are really spectacular.

01:49:19.960 --> 01:49:22.760
It's so generous of you to spend your time,

01:49:22.760 --> 01:49:26.280
and we got to see different sides of your ideas

01:49:26.280 --> 01:49:32.360
and try to reach some sense of different approaches that are radically different,

01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:34.600
and perhaps, but they have the same common goal,

01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:38.040
which is to really introduce the world to concepts

01:49:38.520 --> 01:49:42.520
take us out of our quotidian existence of politics, sports, and whatever,

01:49:42.520 --> 01:49:43.640
the grandest concepts.

01:49:43.640 --> 01:49:45.560
I think we should have talked about those here.

01:49:45.560 --> 01:49:47.400
That would have been more interesting for me.

01:49:47.400 --> 01:49:53.160
Let's do more where we actually treat the people who want to get into the meat of it,

01:49:53.160 --> 01:49:54.200
because I think that-

01:49:54.200 --> 01:49:57.800
No, no. I was saying less meat, because I don't think this was so useful,

01:49:57.800 --> 01:50:02.200
because I think that I felt like we would have done better talking

01:50:02.200 --> 01:50:04.360
about kind of the culture of science and so on.

01:50:04.360 --> 01:50:06.440
I'm sorry. I take all the blame.

01:50:06.440 --> 01:50:09.240
Yes, I know. I'm sorry. It's my fault for not getting to that.

01:50:09.240 --> 01:50:12.200
Thank you, Steven. Thank you, Eric. I love your work. Bye, guys.
