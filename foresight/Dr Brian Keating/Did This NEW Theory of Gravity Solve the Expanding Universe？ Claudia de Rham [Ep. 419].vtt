00:00.000 --> 00:04.160
What if there was an idea, a new theory of gravity that could bridge the gap between

00:04.160 --> 00:09.680
our predictions and observations of the most mysterious substance in the universe,

00:09.680 --> 00:10.560
dark energy?

00:10.560 --> 00:15.680
Everything connects with gravity, everything lives in your spacetime.

00:15.680 --> 00:20.560
Dark energy is a force that scientists believe is causing the expansion of the universe to

00:20.560 --> 00:24.160
not only increase, but to do so at an accelerating rate.

00:24.160 --> 00:28.080
But there are discrepancies between the predicted amounts of dark energy in the universe

00:28.080 --> 00:33.200
and our theoretical calculations based on the properties of the fundamental particles

00:33.200 --> 00:34.240
that we know and love.

00:34.240 --> 00:39.440
We're trying to get to the bottom of this for years, almost 30 years without success.

00:39.440 --> 00:44.080
That is, until today's guests, Professor Claudia Duran proposed a new theory of massive

00:44.080 --> 00:49.920
gravity that could explain why the universe is accelerating and also solve the impossible

00:49.920 --> 00:51.120
dark energy puzzle.

00:51.120 --> 00:56.080
It's really in asking ourselves provocative questions just like you do that we make progress.

00:56.080 --> 01:02.880
Join Claudia and me as we fall headfirst into the dark side of the universe to uncover

01:02.880 --> 01:09.280
its most seemingly impossible mysteries and turn the impossible into the inevitable.

01:09.280 --> 01:09.920
Let's go.

01:09.920 --> 01:11.360
Claudia, how are you doing today?

01:12.080 --> 01:12.880
Well, I'm great.

01:12.880 --> 01:13.200
Thank you.

01:13.200 --> 01:14.000
How are you, Brian?

01:14.000 --> 01:16.400
I'm excellent now that I get a chance to talk to you.

01:16.400 --> 01:21.840
We have a lot in common, but I'm going to start first with a rather provocative question.

01:21.840 --> 01:28.640
If you'll indulge me, a lot of this book and a lot of your work corresponds to the desire to find

01:29.200 --> 01:34.000
a solution to the so-called mass of the graviton.

01:34.000 --> 01:40.080
I want to start by asking you, why should we care about finding the mass or attributing mass

01:40.080 --> 01:44.640
to a particle whose existence we don't even know for sure about?

01:45.280 --> 01:47.840
So that's many, many different reasons.

01:47.840 --> 01:53.360
The first one, I would say, which is going to convince the few people, but is the truth,

01:53.360 --> 01:58.560
is because we as human care about understanding nature at the most fundamental level, and so

01:58.560 --> 02:02.400
we should really always dive deeper and deeper.

02:03.120 --> 02:04.320
That's how we make progress.

02:05.280 --> 02:10.400
Sometimes it's really in asking ourselves provocative questions just like you do that

02:10.400 --> 02:16.160
we make progress and questions that may not have a specific outcome for tomorrow,

02:16.160 --> 02:20.560
but it typically has shaped us, shaped the future of humanity.

02:20.560 --> 02:23.200
That is really the real reason.

02:23.200 --> 02:28.800
But then there's many other reasons I can tell you of why I went into that specific question.

02:30.240 --> 02:35.520
First, let me just say that it's about understanding whether a fundamental particle,

02:35.520 --> 02:43.200
which we may never detect per se, has a mass, but it has an implication also on gravitation

02:43.200 --> 02:49.280
waves, which we do have, we have observed, and actually from the very first detection of

02:49.280 --> 02:55.840
direct detection of gravitational waves here on Earth in 2015, the very one thing,

02:55.840 --> 03:01.760
the first thing that they were able to do is put an upper limit on how massive the

03:01.760 --> 03:06.320
graviton was because it has an effect on the propagation of gravitational waves.

03:06.880 --> 03:12.480
So now that limit is still quite high as compared to what we ideally would like it to be,

03:13.680 --> 03:15.520
for the reasons I'll explain.

03:15.520 --> 03:20.800
But still, in principle, it has some real consequences that we can observe here on Earth

03:20.800 --> 03:24.800
through gravitational waves and through many different tests of gravity,

03:24.800 --> 03:30.640
tests of the universe, tests of why we're here, where we're going, our origin, and all of those

03:30.640 --> 03:31.280
questions.

03:31.280 --> 03:37.200
Why I am interested, why I spend my time looking at that as opposed to all sorts of other fundamental

03:37.200 --> 03:44.560
questions, is because I think it has a potential to tackle the most challenging question of

03:44.560 --> 03:50.000
fundamental physics, the biggest discrepancy of the whole history of science, which is

03:50.800 --> 03:52.880
the cosmological constant problem.

03:52.880 --> 03:59.920
Or in other words, why are we living in an universe that looks the way it does and is

03:59.920 --> 04:07.040
not actually expanding at an accelerated rate, which is way faster by at least 56 orders of

04:07.040 --> 04:14.560
magnitude, if not 120 orders of magnitude, as should be the case if the quantum fluctuations

04:14.560 --> 04:20.720
from all the fields that we know exist, like the electrons and the Higgs and all of those fields,

04:20.720 --> 04:25.280
all of those are the fundamental particles that made us so really exist.

04:25.280 --> 04:32.400
We would expect them to lead to what we call an energy in the vacuum, an energy of nothingness

04:33.120 --> 04:40.560
that fills the whole universe itself and should lead to a hugely faster accelerated

04:40.560 --> 04:42.640
rate of expansion of the universe.

04:42.640 --> 04:47.920
The discrepancy is simply the biggest discrepancy in the whole history of science.

04:48.560 --> 04:54.560
And that is at the interface of the two pillars of modern theoretical physics,

04:54.560 --> 05:01.280
modern science, which on one side is gravity, on the other side is field theory, quantum field

05:01.280 --> 05:05.920
theory, putting the two together, which is really the foundation of the standard model

05:05.920 --> 05:08.240
of particle physics as we know it today.

05:08.240 --> 05:12.560
And so it's very much at the interface between the two of them that we have the biggest discrepancy

05:12.560 --> 05:14.160
we can ever imagine.

05:14.160 --> 05:19.760
And so it seems natural that the resolution is very much at the interface between the two

05:19.760 --> 05:24.960
of them, thinking of gravity, thinking of gravity as well as a quantum field theory

05:24.960 --> 05:29.760
and understanding what are the properties of gravity more fundamentally.

05:30.720 --> 05:37.760
So recently, the DESI collaboration made an announcement that there seems to be evidence

05:37.760 --> 05:43.680
for the variation of the cosmological constant from constant to perhaps a contestant-like

05:43.680 --> 05:44.320
behavior.

05:44.320 --> 05:47.280
Can you tell me how would that impact the statement you just made?

05:47.280 --> 05:53.760
Would it affect the search or the motivation to look for a massive graviton?

05:53.840 --> 05:59.840
So it is within the same framework that something has to be slightly different as compared to the

05:59.840 --> 06:05.840
standard I'll call lambda CDM or vanilla model for the cosmological paradigm,

06:05.840 --> 06:11.760
which we would just think until now everything seemed to fit beautifully with having called

06:11.760 --> 06:15.440
dark matter and a simple cosmological constant.

06:15.440 --> 06:20.400
So very natural in that evolution sense.

06:20.480 --> 06:27.040
In a parameter sense, it's very simple in that sense, but actually in understanding how that

06:27.040 --> 06:31.600
fits in in the bigger picture is that's where the real naturalist question is coming.

06:32.560 --> 06:39.040
And so if there's any departure from this lambda CDM, it really opens up the opportunity

06:39.040 --> 06:44.400
for there to be something else out there and any modification of gravity could feed into that,

06:44.400 --> 06:47.280
any dynamical dark energy could feed into that.

06:47.280 --> 06:50.800
And sometimes there's a little bit of a muchness on how much you consider

06:51.920 --> 06:53.840
modified gravity and dark energy.

06:53.840 --> 07:00.720
You get some models of modification of gravity can be recaptured in effectively looking for

07:00.720 --> 07:06.480
cosmological purposes as a dynamical cosmological constant or dynamical,

07:06.480 --> 07:09.840
shouldn't say cosmological constant, but dynamical dark energy.

07:10.480 --> 07:15.760
So for instance, if you have a theory of massive gravity and you want to tackle the

07:15.760 --> 07:21.360
cosmological constant problem with that, you would want to accept that the universe is filled

07:21.360 --> 07:27.200
with vacuum energy as expected from particle physics, but this huge level of vacuum energy

07:27.200 --> 07:31.920
doesn't lead to a huge accelerated rate of the universe today.

07:31.920 --> 07:37.840
It did in the past, but then through the weakening of gravity due to the mass of the

07:37.840 --> 07:42.880
graviton, through the evolution of the universe, you would have a relaxation of the effect

07:43.440 --> 07:46.880
of this vacuum energy on the evolution of the universe.

07:46.880 --> 07:52.080
So in some sense, it does look like a dynamical or cosmological constant and that seems paradoxical,

07:52.080 --> 07:55.360
but the source would be constant in some sense.

07:55.360 --> 07:58.560
It would be vacuum energy, it would be a cosmological constant,

07:58.560 --> 08:03.280
but then its effect on gravity, its effect on the evolution of the universe would be

08:03.280 --> 08:07.840
dynamical, it would be deleted, relaxed our way through the evolution of the universe.

08:08.400 --> 08:14.560
We would expect in this type of departure from the standard Lambda CD and the standard

08:14.560 --> 08:19.840
cosmological constant. So some of your work in this book, which we will now play my favorite

08:19.840 --> 08:25.920
game about called Judging Books by Their Cover, is about a topic near and dear to my heart,

08:25.920 --> 08:31.200
the cosmic microwave background and the subject of polarization. But before we get there, I want

08:31.200 --> 08:35.360
us to indulge ourselves in this game that I call Judging Books by Their Cover.

08:35.360 --> 08:39.120
So Claudia, please, if you would, take us through the beautiful artwork,

08:39.120 --> 08:42.240
the title and the subtitle of this wonderful book.

08:42.240 --> 08:49.840
Okay. So the title is The Beauty of Falling and the subtitle A Life in Pursuit of Gravity.

08:49.840 --> 08:54.160
And I'm really happy to guess what I mean by all of those things, which is a lot.

08:54.160 --> 08:59.760
But I'm very happy with The Cover, actually, because it's very symbolic of the story.

08:59.760 --> 09:04.240
There is a real story in the book. And so on The Cover, you start seeing on the top

09:04.800 --> 09:11.760
an astronaut, an astronaut floating in mid-air, experiencing some level of free falling and

09:11.760 --> 09:17.920
some freedom, very much some freedom in that. And then in the middle, you see the same person,

09:17.920 --> 09:26.160
I think, Ali, each falling now. You can imagine she's falling. She's falling on earth. She's

09:26.160 --> 09:31.760
really embracing some level of free fall. There's probably some friction from the air because she's

09:31.760 --> 09:37.520
falling on earth, but she's enjoying it. There's a beauty in the fall itself. The fall itself is

09:37.520 --> 09:45.040
beautiful. Maybe what comes next is what was a bit more worrying. But luckily for her, the last

09:45.040 --> 09:51.680
picture, the bottom is her diving in the sea and really enjoying this last part of the free fall

09:51.680 --> 09:58.320
and seeing how this channel, how this falling has been channeling through a different perspective,

09:58.320 --> 10:05.040
now enjoying playing with gravity as she dives in the ocean and enjoying this new environment.

10:05.040 --> 10:09.280
The subtitle is as beautiful. And of course, a lot of these things on The Cover that this

10:09.840 --> 10:16.640
character is experiencing are relevant to you. The first one being astronaut, which you have

10:17.200 --> 10:25.040
attempted to be from the European Space Agency sign. The middle one is you flying, maybe doing a

10:25.040 --> 10:29.440
dive, but there's an airplane in the back. You and I are both pilots. I don't know how much you

10:29.440 --> 10:38.080
fly nowadays, but I have flown a diamond katana before. Yeah, amazing. I know that. I have a

10:38.080 --> 10:43.520
picture of it there. I'm not going to tell the screen right now, but it's a love that happened.

10:43.520 --> 10:49.200
It just wants to fly. It's amazing. It just pulls the nose up and it wants to fly. It's incredible.

10:49.200 --> 10:54.560
And then there's a woman ends up underwater wearing a scuba diving suit. And that takes

10:54.560 --> 11:00.080
me to my first question from my guest, from a not a guest, an audience member who is a very

11:00.080 --> 11:06.480
special person to both of us. His name is Professor Greg Gabadadze, who is not only a friend and a

11:06.480 --> 11:12.720
brilliant scientist and innovator, truly just one of my heroes in science. He's also an administrator

11:13.600 --> 11:19.440
at NYU, a dean. I don't know what masochistic desire he had to do that. He's from Georgia,

11:19.440 --> 11:23.840
not the state, but the country of Georgia. So, you know, they make tough, tough people. They're

11:23.840 --> 11:28.560
brilliant and tough. But Greg asked me to ask you when I solicited a question. He said, thanks

11:28.560 --> 11:32.960
for reaching out. Claudia wrote a wonderful book with a clear and modern perspective on physics

11:32.960 --> 11:36.720
and also connected to remarkable personal experiences. And I have a fun question for

11:36.720 --> 11:41.200
Claudia. I'd ask her if there might be any advantage to thinking about physics while

11:41.200 --> 11:48.160
floating in the cosmos or underwater. And I want to get your answer to that, Gregory's question.

11:48.160 --> 11:54.480
In both ways, I think, being a theoretical physicist and thinking about quite abstract

11:54.480 --> 12:01.280
concepts, I think there is a beauty in doing that when you fly, when you dive, you float in the

12:01.280 --> 12:06.720
cosmos in embracing this understanding of nature at a deeper level. There is a deep connection that

12:06.720 --> 12:11.680
gets there. But also the other way around, of course, I would like to tell you that I'm an

12:11.680 --> 12:19.600
astronaut and I'm doing experiences about gravity in the microgravity on free fall

12:20.320 --> 12:25.920
and orbit around the earth. It hasn't happened. And I'm not doing that when I'm scuba diving.

12:25.920 --> 12:33.360
I'm not doing some explicit state of the art test of gravity when I do that. But I do it with my

12:33.440 --> 12:43.600
body. And I think there is, as you say, Gregory is a very top guy. And I'm not saying that we

12:43.600 --> 12:50.240
should all be very tough, but there is some level in which learning to have this balance between

12:50.880 --> 13:00.240
judging your instinct, judging your intuition in very challenging situations, but also seeing how

13:00.240 --> 13:07.440
much you can judge intuition and how much you have to rely on your confidence to follow a pattern,

13:07.440 --> 13:13.520
to follow the logic, to follow scientific rules in situations where actually your instinct

13:14.160 --> 13:19.200
naively would tell you to do something which would be quite catastrophic. And you are kind of to

13:19.200 --> 13:26.160
you know that, for instance, if you're flying and you're stalling, naturally, if you hadn't had any

13:26.160 --> 13:31.280
training, the first thing you would try to do is pull the nose up because you say you're going down,

13:31.280 --> 13:37.840
you're going to pull the nose up so that you pick up altitude. But actually that decreases the lift

13:37.840 --> 13:45.200
and so the plane sinks much more and that can actually lead to an accident. So following too

13:45.200 --> 13:54.240
much instinct in these situations can lead to catastrophic outcomes. So if you learn to put

13:54.320 --> 14:00.720
yourself in uncomfortable situations and have this balance between knowing what to do, there's a

14:00.720 --> 14:07.360
level of instinct that you learn after having practiced it for hundreds of times, but also

14:07.360 --> 14:12.720
is very much based on scientific understanding. You understand what you have to do logically,

14:12.720 --> 14:20.240
that makes complete sense, and then you train yourself to learn the process in that. With your

14:20.240 --> 14:26.000
body, a situation where your life depends on it, then you can do that on the blackboard so much

14:26.000 --> 14:31.120
easier. Hey there, while Dark Energy is one of the most mysterious concepts in the known universe,

14:31.120 --> 14:36.960
another mystery I'm trying to solve is why only 50% of you out there are subscribed to my YouTube

14:36.960 --> 14:43.280
channel or following the podcast on your favorite podcast app. Are you one of them? Please don't

14:43.280 --> 14:49.600
be in the silent majority. Do me a favor, subscribe, follow, and leave a comment or review. It really

14:49.600 --> 14:53.920
helps me out and I respond to every single one. And when you do it, it helps me get great guests

14:53.920 --> 14:58.720
like Claudia, Dan Dennett, Sam Harris. It's all a numbers game, unfortunately, and we have to make

14:58.720 --> 15:04.320
sure the algorithm respects the matter that matters that we discussed on the Into the Impossible

15:04.320 --> 15:08.960
podcast. So before we get back to the episode, just take a second and hit that subscribe button,

15:09.520 --> 15:15.040
leave a comment or a thumbs up. Anything will help out. Appreciate it. Now back to the episode.

15:15.040 --> 15:19.840
And that brings me to my next question, which is related to this gentleman who

15:19.840 --> 15:22.960
features very prominently in this book, Albert Einstein.

15:25.840 --> 15:30.640
Oh, you do? Okay, we can have a dueling one. So I'm going to do something mean to, which looks cruel,

15:30.640 --> 15:36.000
but actually was one of his most exciting breakthroughs. In fact, he called this the

15:36.000 --> 15:41.600
happiest thought of his life, which was that if he was following, he would experience no

15:41.600 --> 15:46.960
gravitational force. And that led to the Einstein Equivalence Principle. And I want to ask this as

15:46.960 --> 15:53.520
a first detour into your life as a professor and say that nowadays we hear a lot about artificial

15:53.520 --> 15:58.480
intelligence and machine learning and all sorts of things. I think they're very powerful. But as a

15:58.480 --> 16:04.240
professor, I think about, well, how could these things aid us? How could they be better researchers?

16:04.240 --> 16:10.320
Could such an entity, artificial made of silicon and glass and steel and whatever else,

16:11.040 --> 16:17.680
could it experience the joy of falling? Could it experience this most exhilarating feeling of Albert

16:17.680 --> 16:23.920
Einstein? And then if it could experience that viscerally with a body, or if it could not rather

16:23.920 --> 16:28.080
experience because it doesn't have a body, how could it make a breakthrough equivalent to what

16:28.080 --> 16:33.600
Einstein, the greatest scientist of the last 100 years, perhaps, how could it even be considered

16:33.600 --> 16:39.680
to be intelligent if it can't even do what Einstein did? I mean, it's a high bar. But do you think

16:39.680 --> 16:44.400
that physicists can be replaced or mimicked even by artificial intelligence?

16:45.200 --> 16:51.840
I think there's no replacement. I think we've done so well at using things to our advantage. And

16:51.840 --> 16:57.040
there's clear advantages to using national learning. It can speed up a lot of the things.

16:57.040 --> 17:04.080
Now, when it comes to can it feel for us? That's a deep question. I can't do. Do I really feel

17:04.080 --> 17:09.440
something or am I in a matrix and believe that I feel something? And how will I know the difference?

17:09.440 --> 17:17.520
I don't know. I think related to your question is also how we model the world all around us.

17:17.520 --> 17:22.720
If a computer is able to model the world, the universe and nature all around itself to

17:23.440 --> 17:30.640
incredible precision, does it make it that this model is the reality or not? And there's a thin

17:30.640 --> 17:38.320
line there sometimes. So your question makes me reminded of that. If a computer can reproduce all

17:38.320 --> 17:45.680
the signs of what it means to feel something, does it make it feel it or not? You'd think not

17:45.680 --> 17:49.280
because we are experiencing something deeper than that. But how can you tell? I don't know.

17:55.680 --> 18:03.600
But I do think that there is a difference between spinning things up and reproducing,

18:03.600 --> 18:09.120
relying on past understood patterns or past patterns that haven't necessarily been understood,

18:09.120 --> 18:18.080
but have been identified and seeing them and being able to get some sense and logic and

18:18.080 --> 18:24.880
organizing all of that, particularly when it comes to huge level of data, to speed up some

18:24.880 --> 18:32.480
connection between some patterns and some model and some values that you want to take out of these

18:32.480 --> 18:37.840
patterns or these data. There's a huge difference between doing that and actually coming up with a

18:37.840 --> 18:44.720
breakthrough in itself, which requires a huge level of creativity. It's like all of a sudden

18:44.720 --> 18:51.920
thinking you're going to paint the world, but not with pencils and paint, but using another dimension.

18:51.920 --> 18:58.560
And it's something I can't even capture in words. And so if you haven't taught the machine

18:58.560 --> 19:06.560
to think in that language, to use tools that will rely on the extra dimension, let me just

19:06.560 --> 19:12.240
be crazy out there, how could it? I don't think you will out of the blue come up with things we

19:12.240 --> 19:19.040
haven't ourselves yet invented with a completely new language. And so that level of creativity,

19:19.040 --> 19:26.400
I think we will always have. And it's a little bit different. I should say that the response to

19:26.400 --> 19:30.800
that, some people say that computers through machine learning, they can come up with new songs.

19:31.680 --> 19:37.040
And so that shows some level of creativity. But those new songs are still within the same

19:37.040 --> 19:43.600
remit of previous songs, still with music and notes, still within the same sense of that.

19:43.600 --> 19:48.720
It will be quite different to have a sudden think of a new channel of communication, which is not

19:48.720 --> 19:54.240
through sound, is not through light, is not even through gravitational waves. That would be something

19:54.240 --> 19:59.360
yet completely different. And that's what we scientists are very good at, to think about

19:59.920 --> 20:06.080
new ways to connect with the world. And in a 2020 paper published in PRD,

20:06.080 --> 20:11.440
you described the speed of gravity. I always tell my students to their great horror,

20:11.440 --> 20:16.880
the sun could disappear right now. And God forbid that happens, but we wouldn't know for eight minutes.

20:16.880 --> 20:21.440
But is that really true? I mean, how do we know if that's actually true? So your paper,

20:22.080 --> 20:28.560
the speed of gravity with Andrew Tolly at Imperial as well, makes a prediction that

20:29.440 --> 20:36.560
the speed of gravity could differ from lowercase c. And I'm surprised. Why isn't this made a bigger

20:36.560 --> 20:44.080
impact? Or are you even more famous than you are? You can imagine gravitational rain,

20:44.080 --> 20:50.640
but it was where the speed of gravity does depend on the frequency, just like light

20:50.640 --> 20:56.400
depends on the frequency. So not in the vacuum, not in empty space per se. For light, we can

20:56.400 --> 21:03.680
understand. I can sort of conceive what empty space is, is the absence of interactions between light

21:03.680 --> 21:11.600
and anything else. So we are used to the fact that light in space travels at the speed of light.

21:11.600 --> 21:18.320
But if you shine light through water, for instance, then light will start interacting

21:18.320 --> 21:22.960
slightly differently with the medium, with the water, with the water molecules,

21:22.960 --> 21:29.520
depending on the frequency of light. And so you see that. And because of this interaction,

21:29.520 --> 21:35.440
light doesn't travel at the speed of light in the vacuum in water, and the way it travels,

21:35.440 --> 21:40.320
the speed at which it travels depends on its color. So we're all used to that phenomenon.

21:40.320 --> 21:46.000
We all see rainbows, and that's the proof that light doesn't always travel at the speed of light.

21:46.000 --> 21:52.480
So you can ask yourself the same question for gravity. And that's, you know, it's quite subtle

21:52.480 --> 21:59.120
because now, what does it mean in empty space when actually everything connects with gravity?

21:59.120 --> 22:04.960
Everything lives in your space time. And if a universe is filled with dark energy,

22:05.520 --> 22:11.280
then is there such a thing as empty space? I don't know. And it could be that gravitational

22:11.280 --> 22:18.400
waves do interact ever so slightly with anything living in that space time, including dark energy.

22:18.400 --> 22:22.720
And if that were the case, then it would modify the speed of gravitational waves.

22:23.280 --> 22:30.640
It would do so at very, very low frequencies. So if all of a sudden you were to take off the sun,

22:31.360 --> 22:39.520
that would be kind of a high frequency, a high frequency thing. And so the propagation

22:39.520 --> 22:44.720
of this information, well, you would expect it to take very close to eight minutes to reach to us

22:44.720 --> 22:48.800
because at those frequencies, you would expect the speed of gravitational waves to be very,

22:48.800 --> 22:56.080
very close to that of light. And another thing that would come concomitantly with such a phenomenon

22:56.080 --> 23:03.520
would be additional polarization modes in addition to the so-called plus and cross modes that my

23:04.240 --> 23:07.760
colleagues and I are trying to study in the cosmic microwave background.

23:07.760 --> 23:12.480
Can you explain these types of new polarization states? There's a beautiful illustration in the

23:12.480 --> 23:17.920
book about them, the so-called breathing one. That's very evocative. Can you explain what these

23:17.920 --> 23:25.200
polarizations would do and why you manifest that you have to have new polarization states of gravity

23:25.200 --> 23:31.760
if gravitational waves, or you call it glite, that will maybe catch on and supplement your salary

23:31.760 --> 23:38.080
there. I hope so. I hope you get the trademark on that. But how would they manifest themselves?

23:38.080 --> 23:42.320
How would a breathing mode manifest itself? And what would it look like in the power spectrum

23:42.320 --> 23:46.720
of the CMB that my colleagues and I and the Simons Foundation have supported to the tune of over

23:46.720 --> 23:54.000
$110 million so far? First of all, I think we will all sort of accept it that, for instance,

23:54.000 --> 23:59.520
light itself comes in two polarizations and you put some very cool sunglasses and then you see

23:59.600 --> 24:04.240
maybe one polarization and the other one gets filtered out. And we can ask the question already

24:04.240 --> 24:09.360
for gravitational waves. Can you put some cool sunglasses for gravitational waves and only

24:09.360 --> 24:15.600
you see one polarization or the other one? That would be a bit more challenging. But already,

24:15.600 --> 24:21.040
yes, gravitational waves or what I like to call glite, because in some level it's quite similar

24:21.040 --> 24:27.760
to light, comes already in two different flavors. And that's imposed by symmetry according to

24:27.760 --> 24:34.800
Einstein's theory of general relativity. Now imagine that the gravitational waves

24:34.800 --> 24:40.240
weren't traveling at the speed of light, very close to the speed of light, but not necessarily

24:40.240 --> 24:46.800
weren't forced anymore to travel at the speed of light. Then you could, in principle, imagine some

24:46.800 --> 24:52.720
sort of analog to sand waves, some longitudinal waves where you could have some gravitational

24:52.720 --> 24:57.440
waves speeding up a little bit and slowing down a little bit. So these would be modes

24:57.520 --> 25:02.640
which would not look like the standard gravitational waves, the cross and the plus,

25:03.280 --> 25:07.360
which are transfers to the line of propagation of the gravitational waves.

25:07.360 --> 25:11.520
They would actually be along the line of propagation of the gravitational waves.

25:12.080 --> 25:18.560
So that mode, we typically don't like it, but that's a different story. It's just to illustrate

25:18.560 --> 25:24.640
the fact that you open up a whole set of other possibilities once you allow yourself to sink

25:24.640 --> 25:30.080
beyond the box, beyond not that I want to put Einstein's inner box, but beyond the theory of

25:30.080 --> 25:35.520
Einstein's theory of general relativity. And so in addition to this longitudinal loads,

25:35.520 --> 25:40.240
you also have some modes which are in between. So they are a little bit, they're halved through

25:40.240 --> 25:46.640
the transverse direction and halved through the longitudinal direction. And also related to that,

25:46.640 --> 25:52.640
you could have, you can now start imagining quite different things where rather than just have the

25:52.640 --> 25:57.440
plus and the cross mode transfers to the propagation, you could have a breathing mode,

25:57.440 --> 26:03.920
really just think about breathing. And if you think of some beads distributed along the circle,

26:04.880 --> 26:12.400
as the mode, that mode goes through, they would sort of become, seem to suggest a bigger circle

26:12.400 --> 26:18.080
and then come to a smaller circle and bigger circle and smaller circle. There's something quite

26:18.720 --> 26:25.920
pacific about that. I like this picture, it makes me feel meditating as that mode goes through.

26:26.480 --> 26:32.720
That mode is actually very important in any theory of gravity beyond Einstein's theory of

26:32.720 --> 26:39.280
gravity, because that is typically expected to be the smoking gun signature for a theory beyond

26:39.840 --> 26:46.160
Einstein's theory of general relativity. That mode, the real question is why isn't it there

26:46.160 --> 26:50.240
in Einstein's theory of general relativity? You could expect it to be there in principle.

26:50.240 --> 26:55.120
And it's not because of symmetry. Einstein's theory of general relativity was based on the

26:55.120 --> 27:01.120
equivalence principle and on some other principles that nowadays we understand them as being

27:01.120 --> 27:08.240
symmetry driven and that symmetry simply prevents this conformal breathing mode from appearing.

27:09.120 --> 27:15.840
Now you can think if the graviton had a mass, you can always make that mass sufficiently small.

27:15.920 --> 27:22.960
So that you don't see any departure. And that is true, that is true in principle. However,

27:23.760 --> 27:30.640
because now there are additional polarization for gravitational waves, you can think about having

27:30.640 --> 27:35.360
different ways to communicate through gravity. There's different channels of communication

27:35.360 --> 27:42.000
through gravity. And that has a big impact in how we're testing gravity. As you say that would mean,

27:42.000 --> 27:46.720
it could mean for instance that at the very beginning of the universe, you could have production

27:46.720 --> 27:51.680
of not only primordial gravitational waves as the one you're thinking about,

27:51.680 --> 27:58.480
which would lead to valorizations in the CMB. But you could also think of production of primordial

27:58.480 --> 28:04.480
gravitational waves in this breathing mode. Now this breathing mode in itself, from a cosmological

28:04.480 --> 28:10.240
perspective, it wouldn't be during inflation, it wouldn't necessarily look so dissimilar to the

28:10.240 --> 28:16.880
inflaton itself or to the other field that are already present and whose effect has already been

28:16.880 --> 28:23.920
seen and printed in the CMB through the temperature fluctuations. So actually, there are models out

28:23.920 --> 28:30.960
there of massive gravity for the very beginning of the universe, where this additional polarization

28:30.960 --> 28:38.560
of the gravitational waves do act potentially as a substitute for the inflaton. And for the

28:38.560 --> 28:46.400
fluctuations in those, those primordial breathing mode polarizations would lead to the temperature

28:48.000 --> 28:52.400
fluctuations that we do see in the in the cosmic microwave background, for instance.

28:52.400 --> 28:58.320
So would there be a modification to the BB mode power spectrum, the autocorrelation, or would it

28:58.320 --> 29:05.200
induce new forbidden correlations, EB correlations, would it change the shape of the autocorrelation?

29:05.280 --> 29:08.960
Is there some way to detect it, you know, because these are the only, this is all you have, right?

29:08.960 --> 29:14.080
You make the case in the, in the, in the book that beyond the, beyond the, you know, realm of the

29:14.080 --> 29:18.880
galaxy or even clusters, there's no hope of discovering physics of gravity at the Planck scale,

29:18.880 --> 29:24.400
other than inflation, if inflation did take place, we don't know that it did. Some of us hope that it

29:24.400 --> 29:30.320
did, but we've had that, we've had that dream before. But the question is, are there new observable

29:30.320 --> 29:35.200
signatures that we can use to detect the presence or absence of a massive graviton or and the

29:35.200 --> 29:39.440
concomitant breathing modes that would also be induced in novel polarization states?

29:39.440 --> 29:46.480
Yeah. So that's a great question. One of the things that would happen is if the, if the mass of

29:46.480 --> 29:52.240
a graviton is a little bit too large, if you imagine you have a graviton being too massive,

29:52.240 --> 29:58.560
then it would prevent the, prevent the production of primordial gravitational waves whose frequency

29:58.560 --> 30:05.280
are comparable as the mass of the graviton during the, the period where they should have been produced.

30:05.280 --> 30:10.720
So in effect, what you would expect in the power spectrum of primordial

30:11.760 --> 30:17.120
polarization, or of primordial gravitational waves, let me say, of b-mode polarization,

30:17.120 --> 30:24.080
you would expect a plateau. You wouldn't expect any production of primordial gravitational waves

30:24.080 --> 30:31.120
at very low L because those would be forbidden by the, the fact that the, the graviton

30:31.120 --> 30:35.680
prevents the production of primordial gravitational waves within that, those scales.

30:36.400 --> 30:43.120
So seeing actually the production of primordial gravitational waves or CMB polarization, b-mode

30:43.920 --> 30:49.680
spectrum at very low L, that would be assigned against massive gravity, against a massive

30:49.680 --> 30:55.200
graviton, against massive polarizations during the period of concentration.

30:55.200 --> 30:58.320
One thing that people don't talk about as much, I mean, people don't talk about this

30:59.280 --> 31:04.400
massive gravitons very much either, but, but comparatively, even if you can imagine, even

31:04.400 --> 31:09.760
less attention is paid to the existence of spin three halves particles. We have a spin zero

31:09.760 --> 31:14.480
particles, we have abundance of those, we have a lot of spin one halves, thank God, or you and I

31:14.480 --> 31:19.040
wouldn't be here talking, we have plenty of light, you know, with an L and no G in front of it,

31:19.040 --> 31:24.160
we even have hopes of glite with spin, but the absent, you know, the, the so-called black sheep,

31:24.160 --> 31:29.840
maybe the missing, you know, missing, missing term, missing spin statistic term,

31:29.840 --> 31:35.120
it's been three halves. Why? What, what did nature do to so alienate one of the

31:35.920 --> 31:40.320
most prominent types of fundamental intrinsic spin modes that could possibly exist?

31:40.320 --> 31:44.880
Yeah, it's a good question. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I mean,

31:45.840 --> 31:50.400
those particles, not at the fundamental level, but at composite level, they do, they do exist,

31:50.400 --> 31:55.520
so we know they can't be represented to some level in nature, but having them as fundamental

31:55.520 --> 32:00.960
particle, we know that then their interactions with other fields is, is very difficult and

32:00.960 --> 32:08.000
their implementation within a theory of gravity is also very, very challenging. I know that for

32:08.000 --> 32:14.400
spin two, and it's the same case for, for spin three half as well, the, the framework in which

32:14.400 --> 32:21.280
you construct the, even the, the nonlinearities, the interactions for spin up to, up to one

32:22.480 --> 32:27.280
is relatively straightforward, I would say, and the connection with gravity as well,

32:27.280 --> 32:32.160
and it's relatively straightforward, but when you go beyond that, it becomes extremely complicated,

32:32.160 --> 32:38.400
and Annie, you have to be very subtle in how you try to connect those modes with others,

32:38.400 --> 32:44.880
how they communicate with others. You very easily open new channels of instabilities,

32:44.880 --> 32:50.320
so it's not typically, you can just add some level of interactions, and you're okay with that.

32:50.320 --> 32:55.760
As soon as you open up a smallest level of interaction, you need to reinvent the wheel,

32:55.760 --> 33:01.680
if so says reinvent a whole framework to see how they embed into a deeper, a deeper one.

33:01.680 --> 33:05.520
So that we see from the theoretical perspective how challenging it is.

33:06.480 --> 33:12.080
And so maybe, maybe because of everything that comes along with it, it's much harder

33:13.040 --> 33:19.280
for them to manifest themselves in nature. Hey there, dark matter is mysterious, but

33:19.280 --> 33:26.000
ordinary matter can be had in the form of a meteorite. If you just do me the favor of joining

34:01.520 --> 34:09.840
Claudia D'Aram. Very interesting. I think another question that my listeners and viewers might have

34:09.840 --> 34:15.280
is this concept of extra dimensions, which plays a big role in your research. Is there any

34:16.160 --> 34:22.000
difference between when you speak about extra dimensions and when string theorists or fundamental

34:22.720 --> 34:27.920
particle physicists speak about it? They both require or mandate the existence of these things,

34:27.920 --> 34:32.720
which are as yet undetected, as you say in the book. So what is it? Are these extra dimensions

34:33.440 --> 34:36.800
related to the extra dimensions of string theory? And if not, what are they?

34:36.800 --> 34:40.320
The way I think about them doesn't preclude them from coming from string theory,

34:40.880 --> 34:46.320
but actually the concept of extra dimension is a very, very old one. And within the framework

34:46.320 --> 34:55.120
of general relativity, the same modern framework as in which we understand them today, they were

34:55.120 --> 35:01.760
already proposed by Kalutza and Klein very, very shortly after the proposal of general

35:01.760 --> 35:07.840
relativity. They have very natural extension of general relativity. They have sort of taken

35:07.840 --> 35:14.560
a comeback since string theory, because string theory needs them, was if you don't think of string

35:14.560 --> 35:21.760
theory, you can ask yourself as to why we live in a world where there is three dimensional space

35:21.760 --> 35:26.560
and one of time, you can ask yourself why is that the case, but you don't necessarily believe that

35:26.560 --> 35:32.000
there needs to be an additional one, extra one. Whereas in string theory, there needs to be extra

35:32.000 --> 35:38.960
one, there's no choice on the matter. And then they are typically expected to be confined around

35:38.960 --> 35:45.200
themselves, compactified, very small, very, very small extra dimensions, or there could be some

35:45.200 --> 35:53.040
larger ones. And there we would be confined on a membrane and a brain, deep brain in those extra

35:53.040 --> 36:00.640
dimensions. But a lot of my research in the way I've been thinking about it and looking at implications

36:00.640 --> 36:07.200
for gravity and for cosmology, that was very much some of those ideas were motivated by string

36:07.200 --> 36:13.360
theory. I don't necessarily need to have string theory to think about them. But a lot of them

36:13.360 --> 36:19.680
nowadays, they are motivated again for one for another. In themselves, actually very natural.

36:20.560 --> 36:24.720
One of the questions, I think to me, one of the most fundamental questions there is why

36:25.440 --> 36:31.280
why three dimension and you mentioned Robert Brunnenberger earlier, he's one that he's an

36:31.280 --> 36:36.160
incredible physicist, but he's one of the physicists that has come up with the most

36:37.120 --> 36:44.080
ideas on why it is that we're experiencing three dimensions. Even in string theory,

36:45.120 --> 36:52.560
we understand there are extra dimensions, but precisely what is the mechanism that led to us

36:52.560 --> 36:59.200
living in a universe that experiences three dimensions is something quite challenging. And

36:59.200 --> 37:04.560
it's not natural at all in string theory. It's very hard to make that work. There's no natural

37:04.560 --> 37:14.800
process. He and collaborators of him, also, and Davis and with Dura have been people have been

37:14.800 --> 37:24.080
exploring the idea of how dynamically you can have sort of a selection mechanism that either picks

37:24.080 --> 37:29.920
out membranes in extra dimensions with which are three plus one dimensional. There's almost an

37:29.920 --> 37:35.840
evolution selection mechanism where those are the ones we end up living in or some other types

37:35.840 --> 37:42.000
of mechanisms in why the other dimension would be confined, compactified to be very small,

37:42.240 --> 37:49.760
we only experience the ones we do. But even in both case scenarios assumes the existence of other

37:49.760 --> 37:57.200
dimensions and that could have consequences on us. To see the consequences of that, typically,

37:57.840 --> 38:02.880
you expect you have to go to very high energy scale to be able to probe those extra dimensions,

38:02.880 --> 38:08.000
and that corresponds to going, again, back to the very early universe, again, to the type of

38:08.000 --> 38:12.640
research that you're doing. And it is possible, and I would hope very much so, that it could be

38:12.640 --> 38:18.800
imprints on the very early universe of those extra dimensions. And that could be imprints on the power

38:18.800 --> 38:24.720
spectrum of the CMB and B mode polarization, possibly. That's for you to tell me, actually,

38:25.280 --> 38:30.400
they can be in some other models of extra dimensions, they can be some effect, actually,

38:30.960 --> 38:36.400
not at very high energy, but at very low energy, that things will look very similar to,

38:36.960 --> 38:40.800
and will look four dimensional, three plus one, necessarily four dimensional, I mean,

38:40.800 --> 38:46.880
three of space and one of time dimension for everyday life. But as you go to larger and

38:46.880 --> 38:53.520
larger distances on the cosmological distances, then you're able to start probing the extra dimension.

38:53.520 --> 39:00.160
And that's why the universe, the evolution of the universe nowadays seems kind of counterintuitive,

39:01.040 --> 39:06.640
and that's because we're starting possibly to probe the extra dimension, the extra dimension of space.

39:06.640 --> 39:13.200
So it's sort of a relic or a shadow of the higher dimensions that we perceive in the pre-dimension?

39:13.200 --> 39:18.000
Yeah, there's a lot of models out there where our cosmological evolution,

39:18.960 --> 39:25.600
what we live as a universe is really, as you say, reminiscent of our shadow, a consequence of our

39:25.600 --> 39:32.240
motion through time, yes, but really through the extra dimensional space. We are traveling through

39:32.240 --> 39:37.520
this extra dimensional space, and that has an effect on our universe as a whole, with just a

39:37.520 --> 39:42.960
consequence of that. A question I have for you, perhaps to elucidate, and I've asked it to many

39:42.960 --> 39:48.720
scientists, but I never really get an answer that I can try. And I've asked even Roger Penrose,

39:48.720 --> 39:52.720
in his multiple occasions of being on the podcast. And then you hope I have an answer.

39:55.760 --> 40:00.640
I hear what he says, but I don't know if I understand what he says, although that might be

40:00.640 --> 40:06.880
due to my failure to have consciousness, according to him. But my question for you is, first, do we

40:06.880 --> 40:12.000
need a quantum theory of gravity? I mean, the only two scenarios where quantum gravity seems to

40:12.000 --> 40:19.440
pertain in any kind of important, impactful, relevant role is not in our daily lives, but are

40:19.440 --> 40:26.160
at the singularities of black holes, and perhaps the origin of time, if indeed time had an origin,

40:26.160 --> 40:30.960
and many people don't believe that it did, or it was a classical bounce, or different cosmological

40:30.960 --> 40:36.160
models, past guests, Paul Steinhart, Anna Aegis, Neil Turrock, many others, don't believe in the

40:36.160 --> 40:41.760
singular quantum gravity necessity. So why do we need a theory of quantum gravity? If these

40:42.320 --> 40:48.640
only two realms that we know about are shielded by event horizons, what's the point? We'll never

40:48.640 --> 40:54.880
be able to witness this anyway. So actually, I am working on some understanding how to make that

40:54.880 --> 41:03.680
connection. So you probably want concretely to understand how to compute those things in situation

41:03.680 --> 41:10.080
that we will likely never experience ourselves. That is true. But at the same time, we want to

41:10.160 --> 41:14.960
understand why we live in the world we are living in. I think we all want to ask ourselves those

41:14.960 --> 41:20.800
questions. It's all part of the origin. Why are we here? Why is life here? Why are universes here?

41:20.800 --> 41:29.200
But even more fundamentally, why is representation of nature, representation of spacetime here,

41:29.200 --> 41:36.560
and that the answer is, I think, seated in a theory, a more fundamental theory, a more fundamental

41:36.560 --> 41:44.320
theory of something that unifies, again, not only the fundamental forces of nature, as we know them

41:44.320 --> 41:51.280
with the weak and strong forces and electromagneticism, but also gravity and this unification

41:51.280 --> 41:57.200
could have some consequences. What is our deep down origin in terms of what is the origin of

41:57.200 --> 42:06.400
spacetime itself? I think we talked about that at the beginning already. Why are we pursuing

42:06.480 --> 42:12.480
some such fundamental questions that we'll never be able to really experience the consequences of

42:12.480 --> 42:20.720
that? History has told us that often we think that would be the case. We saw Einstein thought

42:20.720 --> 42:27.840
that gravitational waves will never have any consequences to our life. No, no, no connections

42:27.840 --> 42:34.560
to reality. We do use them now to communicate in some sense. Maybe communicate is a big word

42:34.560 --> 42:40.800
because that incinerates a two-way communication, which is not the case so far, but we do communicate

42:40.800 --> 42:47.520
with them with the universe. We use them as a new window, as a new way to see our universe,

42:47.520 --> 42:53.200
see gravitational waves. That's an example where 100 years ago we thought there's never any use to

42:53.200 --> 43:01.440
it, and yet we're here. They are real. We have detected them. The fact that I can't tell you

43:01.440 --> 43:09.120
right now whether we'll ever be able to experience a situation where quantum gravity is needed to

43:09.840 --> 43:16.240
predict what happens precisely doesn't mean that there wouldn't be one, but who is to answer that

43:16.240 --> 43:22.400
if we don't know what it is, we'll never be able to even answer that. I think we need to explore

43:22.400 --> 43:28.000
beyond what we know to be able to see how much more there is out there and make sense of all

43:28.000 --> 43:33.280
of those things. Let me go back to that point because we do say, for instance, I'm not a strength

43:33.280 --> 43:38.320
theorist, so I can say that. I'm not a strength theorist. Nobody's perfect, Claudia. Nobody's

43:38.320 --> 43:46.480
perfect. I'm not a strength theorist. I'm quite agnostic on whatever is going on at very high

43:46.480 --> 43:51.600
energy, and some of my colleagues would not talk to me anymore for saying that. By the way, I have

43:51.600 --> 43:56.880
to interrupt you and pardon my interruption, but part of the mission of this podcast is to educate

43:56.960 --> 44:02.080
young scientists and how to be a good scientist. I just want to highlight what Claudia just said,

44:02.720 --> 44:08.320
that it's her job, and my job as an experimentalist, her job as a theorist, to be agnostic. I was

44:08.320 --> 44:13.520
asked by the New York Times recently, what do I hope for? What do I really want to find with the

44:13.520 --> 44:19.920
Simon's Observatory? I said, our job is not to prove things. My job is to prove people like you

44:19.920 --> 44:25.440
wrong, and your job is to keep refining what you know about the universe so that eventually I can't

44:25.440 --> 44:30.560
prove you wrong, but that won't prove you right. What Claudia just did is incredibly important,

44:30.560 --> 44:36.480
right? That's right. It's never about proving someone right or wrong in some sense. It's more

44:36.480 --> 44:43.120
about deepening our understanding of nature. That's where we're going. This is why the book

44:43.120 --> 44:48.640
is called The Beauty of Falling, because I will fall every day. I will come up with things which

44:48.640 --> 44:53.040
are wrong every day. I will fall, and that is important. This is the way we make progress.

44:54.000 --> 44:59.520
Right. At the end, you say, in fact, past these pictures that that is part of the beauty, is that

44:59.520 --> 45:06.000
not just that you fall, and that that can be awesome, but part of the journey is

45:07.200 --> 45:13.600
how you get back up, and how you respond to these challenges. I think, again, just for my young

45:13.600 --> 45:18.560
students and postdocs and young faculty and old faculty who might need to learn this lesson,

45:19.200 --> 45:24.320
the concept of quantum gravity is a beautiful one, because we have this innate need to

45:24.320 --> 45:29.760
quantize everything we see. It's done so well, but the question I have even goes, you talk about

45:29.760 --> 45:36.000
pie in the sky, and it reminded me of this past guest, Elon Musk, who I did talk to on the podcast

45:36.000 --> 45:43.360
tangentially. You can find it on the videos and audio, but he once said the plank length sets

45:43.360 --> 45:47.920
this fundamental limit beyond which we don't even need to know the digits of pie. In other words,

45:47.920 --> 45:55.200
there's some minimum radius circle, which would be the plank length. I responded to him, he didn't

45:55.200 --> 46:01.040
write back, but that's sort of nonsensical. Nothing really happens at the plank length. Am

46:01.040 --> 46:07.280
I wrong about that? It is a correspondence, a numerological coincidence, but nothing more,

46:07.280 --> 46:12.640
or am I wrong? What we know is that there comes a point, it's not about a distance. It never was

46:12.640 --> 46:19.920
about a distance in itself. It's about when the curvature, some measurable effect of the

46:19.920 --> 46:26.080
curvature becomes big enough, and that is not so much about what distance you can measure, but

46:26.720 --> 46:32.240
for instance, going within regions of space-time where you end up having, for instance, close to a

46:32.240 --> 46:36.640
black hole or at the big bang, as you were mentioning, there will seem to suggest that the

46:36.640 --> 46:43.840
curvature there becomes very large. So that a physical region where these things can happen,

46:43.840 --> 46:52.400
but understanding how we transition from the semi-classical model of gravity through general

46:52.400 --> 47:00.560
relativity, which is embedded in an effective quantum field theory, how we transition between

47:00.560 --> 47:08.320
that and something which takes over when this effective quantum field theory breaks down,

47:08.320 --> 47:14.080
I think it is important to make communication between the two, and a lot of the work I do at

47:14.080 --> 47:19.920
the moment, which is a lot of massive gravity, is to understand what are the key ingredients

47:20.800 --> 47:28.160
that we have to keep beyond our understanding of reality, beyond general activity. You don't

47:28.160 --> 47:32.640
even think of those concepts anymore. You don't think of space and time anymore,

47:32.640 --> 47:38.960
but you think of probabilities, and you think of the notion of causality is extremely important,

47:38.960 --> 47:48.720
and it's embedded not so much into return to the future kind of cartoon line, but it's encoded

47:48.720 --> 47:55.360
in deep statements in how we can think of probabilities, and how we can think of also

47:55.360 --> 48:01.280
the notion of probabilities in a quantum sense, whether they respect some notion of

48:01.280 --> 48:07.920
unitarity, where if you sum up the probabilities of a given outcome, whether they will sum up to one,

48:07.920 --> 48:14.400
or whether they sum up to something imaginary or negative, which would make no sense.

48:14.400 --> 48:21.520
And so these are very, very basic criteria that are satisfied by string theory, for instance,

48:21.520 --> 48:26.800
and you like to ask yourself, without necessarily even relying on string theory, are those

48:27.680 --> 48:35.440
concepts even correct? And is it okay for me to rely on them when all other notions of reality

48:35.440 --> 48:45.920
have fallen apart? Is it okay for me to rely on those specific, just hang on onto them to see how

48:46.000 --> 48:52.640
this very basic principle cascades that way down to something concrete at low energy,

48:52.640 --> 48:59.200
and something which is consistent with what we observe? And we can actually make connections,

48:59.200 --> 49:04.400
we can actually come, I can come up, I can give you a model today that seems completely

49:05.040 --> 49:11.440
meaningful, I can come up with a model that can describe most of, or if not,

49:11.440 --> 49:16.880
everything that I'd observed today. And then I know that if I were to go back up and make a

49:16.880 --> 49:24.240
connection with how it will be realized at very, much more fundamentally, it will have to break

49:24.240 --> 49:28.560
some of those assumptions. It will have to break some of this assumption of unitarity,

49:28.560 --> 49:33.840
or causality, or some of the way I think about these much more basic amplitudes. And so I think

49:33.840 --> 49:40.240
it is important in some sense to see what is it we're relying on at the end of the day? What are

49:40.240 --> 49:50.000
we aiming for? And we know that the way we're going to end up describing things, nature, once we

49:50.000 --> 49:55.360
no longer can rely on even the notion of space and time to describe them is going to be very

49:55.360 --> 50:00.800
challenging. We're going to need to invent new tools, new way to thinking to represent them.

50:00.800 --> 50:05.600
And I don't even know precisely what is the right question for me to ask to even be able to

50:06.240 --> 50:13.920
express that. But I want to hang on on very basic principles. And I think it is a meaningful

50:13.920 --> 50:20.240
question for me to ask myself, are those okay to rely on? Because if they're not, then I have to

50:20.240 --> 50:25.680
give up even more than that. Yeah. And I guess the question I keep coming back to is what would

50:26.240 --> 50:36.320
constitute a detection of a quantum nature of gravity? And how could we do it? In the case,

50:36.320 --> 50:40.080
we have to be open to the prospect that the Simons Observatory and every other observatory

50:40.080 --> 50:44.800
may fail to detect gravitational waves and primordial nature. But that doesn't mean we

50:44.800 --> 50:49.040
couldn't rule out quantum gravity. And when I go back in another way, in addition to Robert

50:49.040 --> 50:54.080
Brandenberger, in addition to being pilots, in addition to, I'm not interested in scuba diving,

50:54.080 --> 50:59.280
but we were both at Case Western, where the very first Michelson interferometer was done.

50:59.280 --> 51:03.200
And I understand from your book that, you know, Michelson got into a little bit of a

51:03.200 --> 51:09.200
palaver, as you Brits might say, you're not British. But the point being, they used a

51:09.200 --> 51:13.520
Michelson interferometer, and now we have these LIGO machines. And my friend Eric Weinstein,

51:13.520 --> 51:17.280
you know, came up with a beautiful thought experiment that I want to run by you as we

51:17.280 --> 51:21.520
wrap up. Imagine the double slit experiment. The double slit experiment is the most quantum of

51:21.760 --> 51:27.760
quantum mechanical experiments in terms of manifesting truly irreproducible quantum behavior.

51:27.760 --> 51:31.200
Eric asked the question to me, and I couldn't answer it, so I'll ask it to you. Hopefully,

51:31.200 --> 51:35.360
you can answer it. But if you had a double slit experiment, you know, the electron goes through,

51:35.360 --> 51:39.280
you know, these, you know, goes through both slits, the wave function goes through both

51:39.280 --> 51:45.200
slits in some sense. But, but in a classical sense, could you not use the gravitational effects

51:45.200 --> 51:50.480
of the electron, just as a thought experiment? And could you not probe the use the gravitational

51:50.480 --> 51:55.600
waves produced by this electron as it flies through, you know, presumably one of the two slits,

51:55.600 --> 52:01.120
at least in Einstein's conception. So could you use these interferometers, these Michelson

52:01.120 --> 52:06.640
interferometers of LIGO, just as a thought experiment, to reveal which segment of the,

52:06.640 --> 52:11.360
or which slit the electron went through, and therefore, you know, kind of simultaneously

52:11.360 --> 52:14.400
be able to localize its position and momentum in a sense.

52:14.400 --> 52:17.120
But from the gravitational waves produced by the electron itself?

52:17.680 --> 52:23.520
Yeah, you use the gravitational waves to then measure the, the, which slit the electron went

52:23.520 --> 52:31.680
through. Yeah. So you need to look at what is the magnitude of a gravitational wave the

52:31.680 --> 52:35.760
the electron would produce. I'm not saying you could do it. Yeah, that was my thought too.

52:35.760 --> 52:42.240
And that is very weak. That is going to be very, very weak in, in, in amplitude. And the issue

52:42.240 --> 52:48.560
with that is that if you have a very weak gravitational wave that goes through, then in,

52:49.200 --> 52:55.280
in the case of the interferometers here on earth, then they will move the position of the,

52:55.280 --> 53:02.240
the mirrors, which will be below Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Now I am a theorist,

53:02.240 --> 53:07.200
so I have no problem saying and applying for funding to say, let's build an

53:07.200 --> 53:12.960
interferometer, which is of the size of the universe. Let's do that. But even if you get the

53:12.960 --> 53:22.640
funding, you know, you write the proposal then. So let's do that. I'll talk to Greg. You help me

53:22.640 --> 53:34.560
sweet talk Greg. Okay. I'm going to be blacklisted. The issue is if you think, if you think about

53:34.560 --> 53:42.320
the gravitational wave produced by an electron in that process, it's, it's way too weak to being able

53:42.320 --> 53:49.040
to, to detect its effect. So but there are some experiments out there where I think one, one,

53:49.600 --> 53:55.680
one of the experiments you should try to think about is having electrons absorbing a gravitational

53:55.680 --> 54:01.440
wave and a quantum of gravitational waves. So absorb a graviton. That's really what you

54:01.440 --> 54:07.280
want to do to test the quantum nature of gravity in a way which would be very similar to that of

54:07.280 --> 54:14.960
light. We know that electrons can absorb or emit unique quanta, discrete quanta of light

54:14.960 --> 54:21.280
or photons. And as they do that as a change in energy level around the atoms. So you want to do

54:21.280 --> 54:27.040
the same thing with gravitons. And in principle, that would happen. The probability would be very,

54:27.040 --> 54:31.120
very small. But in principle, you can imagine that would happen. The issue is always

54:32.240 --> 54:37.840
the reality of the world in which we live in. That's, it's just so sad because it's not the

54:37.840 --> 54:43.040
process that is quite so, I mean, it is challenging in itself. It's not, it's not just that. It's the

54:43.040 --> 54:48.720
fact that there's a lot of noise out there. There's a lot of other things that would that lead to

54:48.720 --> 54:54.960
electrons changing energy levels, for instance. And so if you want to shield your whole experiment

54:54.960 --> 55:00.560
from light and the trainers and all sorts of other cosmic rays that would have the same effect on

55:00.560 --> 55:07.200
your electrons, you're in trouble, but that it's the reality of life in which we, which we live in.

55:07.200 --> 55:14.720
If we were living in a much simpler universe where there was no, nothing other than electrons and,

55:15.920 --> 55:22.000
and, and gravitons and there was no cosmic rays and even light, or then it may be, it may have

55:22.000 --> 55:29.200
been easier to abstract yourself from any other noise and prove maybe the quantum nature of gravity.

55:29.200 --> 55:34.000
Well, I think that would be a wonderful place to wrap up. There's so many interesting things we could

55:34.000 --> 55:40.080
explore in this wonderful new book. We'll have to do it perhaps in person someday. The beauty of

55:40.080 --> 55:46.480
Falling is a beautiful book, A Life in Pursuit of Gravity, and it's endorsed by some of the

55:46.560 --> 55:54.160
past guests on the podcast, including Sarah Seeger and Sean Carroll, both, both of them give it their

55:54.160 --> 56:01.360
most high encomium, as do I. Claudia de Rome, I hope you have a great deal of success with this

56:01.360 --> 56:06.320
wonderful book. And I think your students are lucky to have you and your colleagues are lucky to have

56:06.320 --> 56:12.400
you. And it's wonderful to have an iconoclastic thinker that, that does can, can, can, can operate

56:12.400 --> 56:16.560
as you do in the mainstream. You can talk to string theorists. You can talk to

56:17.520 --> 56:24.400
people that study loop quantum gravity or causal set theory. And you're not afraid to, to kind of

56:24.400 --> 56:29.920
push back respectfully as, as I think is so refreshing. So this, this book is a wonderful

56:29.920 --> 56:34.720
edition. It's incredibly readable. I listened to it. Princeton University sent me the audio copy as

56:34.720 --> 56:40.880
well, which is not read by you, but, but is a delightful voice, whoever the, the narrator is. So

56:40.880 --> 56:45.200
I cannot recommend this highly enough. Thank you. Thank you, Brian. It was so much fun to talk to you.

56:45.200 --> 56:49.600
Thanks. Thanks. Hey there. I know if you watched all the way to the end, you're going to love this

56:49.600 --> 56:55.200
interview with Lawrence Krauss, one of the progenitors of the notion of dark energy. And click
