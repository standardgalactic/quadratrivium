1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,080
In 2001, 20 years ago this year,

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,520
my colleagues Andrew Lang, Jamie Bock,

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,120
and Bill Holtzampfel came up with a proposal

4
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,640
for what would later be called Bicep.

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,800
Bicep has morphed over the years into Bicep 2,

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,440
Bicep 3, and now Bicep Array.

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,160
It's a stunning series of experiments

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,120
that unfortunately I'm no longer involved with

9
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,840
if you've read my previous book,

10
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,280
A Farewell to Arms.

11
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,680
No, losing the Nobel Prize.

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,720
I described how I came to both part ways with

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,720
and also be inspired by the continuing developments

14
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,920
with the Bicep team.

15
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,800
Recently, an analysis was published

16
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,080
in physical review letters,

17
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,960
one of the most prestigious journals in all of physics,

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,760
that has the most stringent limits to date

19
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,000
on cosmic inflation and the observable signature

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,240
that might or might not be present

21
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,900
from an early inflationary expansion of the universe.

22
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,920
While I'm not involved with the project anymore,

23
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,120
I'm fascinated by it and I wanna explain to you

24
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,560
the significance of these results

25
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,800
and where will cosmologists go from here.

26
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,440
Come along into the impossible.

27
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,280
Any sufficiently advanced technology

28
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,160
is indistinguishable from magic.

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,160
Spoiler alert, we haven't discovered anything in this field

30
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,560
in terms of unequivocal proof or evidence

31
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,240
for an inflationary origin of the universe.

32
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,800
There's a lot of circumstantial evidence,

33
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,480
as we've talked about, but there's also competing models

34
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,280
ranging from Sir Roger Penrose's

35
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,000
conformal cyclic cosmology to Paul Steinhart

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,440
and Aegis's bouncing cosmological models

37
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:34,200
and many more that we will discuss in future videos.

38
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,160
Now, the question of whether or not the universe originated

39
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,400
in a massive superluminal expansion known as inflation

40
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,400
has fascinated me personally since the early 2000s

41
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,880
when I first came up with the idea

42
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,360
to build a tiny refracting telescope,

43
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,280
one that Galileo Galilei would surely recognize

44
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,200
at the bottom of the world, Antarctica,

45
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,840
specifically the South Pole.

46
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,080
And over time, we made more and more sensitive upper limits.

47
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:00,560
That is, we've excluded an inflationary energy event

48
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,040
above a certain value.

49
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,120
Cosmologists parameterize the amount

50
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,320
of inflationary gravitational wave energy

51
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,040
by what's known as the tensor to scalar ratio.

52
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,000
The symbol is lowercase r.

53
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,720
And that is the relative ratio

54
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,560
between so-called gravitational wave

55
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,160
or tensor perturbations and ordinary density

56
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,360
or scalar perturbation.

57
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,760
I'm your density.

58
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,560
We've been setting limits on these effects

59
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,200
for over a decade

60
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,200
with the dedicated bicep series of experiments.

61
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,360
And this new recent result comes

62
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,840
from the bicep-3 incarnation of bicep,

63
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,440
which is a massive expansion to anything

64
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,480
I would have ever conceived of back in 2001.

65
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,920
This is an instrument that has

66
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,280
about a half a meter diameter aperture.

67
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,920
And it's significantly larger, almost three times larger

68
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,880
than the original bicep-1 aperture.

69
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,740
It can cram in many, many more detectors.

70
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,540
And couple those detectors

71
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:56,700
with very, very sensitive phased array-type technology.

72
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,940
In the original bicep-1, we only had 49

73
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,740
polarized metal machine feed horns

74
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,860
that we used to detect these tiny differences

75
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,580
in the amount of polarization in the microwave background.

76
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,660
But the incarnation of these telescopes

77
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,220
from bicep-1 to bicep-2,

78
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,900
which used transition and superconducting detectors,

79
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,300
to the current bicep-3

80
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,260
and now bicep array series of detectors,

81
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,100
has been a slow, steady increase,

82
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,940
not unlike your iPhone and its evolution from iPhone 1

83
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,060
all the way up until the current iPhone 13.

84
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:30,420
And back in 2001, we barely had iPods,

85
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,340
and it's just stunning to think about

86
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,620
how far the technology has come.

87
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,940
And these detectors are made by brilliant colleague,

88
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:40,740
Jamie Bach at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory,

89
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:44,700
and also supported via a wide variety of scientists

90
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,900
all over the world.

91
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:46,940
And even though, as I say,

92
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,980
I'm not involved with the bicep-3 and beyond incarnations,

93
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,900
I still can't help but feel a tiny bit of interest,

94
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,460
vested interest, if you will,

95
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,460
in the success of the project.

96
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:00,540
Recently, we heard a great fanfare announced

97
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,660
because of the threshold that was reached

98
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,220
by the bicep-3 experiment.

99
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:08,260
This is reproduced from the physical review letters article

100
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,020
I'll show it on the screen here,

101
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,740
that broke through this barrier.

102
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:14,260
It broke through what's called an uncertainty level

103
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,700
on the amount of tensor to scalar ratio,

104
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,460
the amount of gravitational wave energy

105
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,620
in the early universe,

106
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,860
produced presumably by an inflationary event

107
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,940
where the Inflaton scalar field

108
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,660
had fluctuations of the space-time metric

109
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,500
that then nucleated waves of gravity,

110
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,780
which travel at the speed of light,

111
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:31,900
endure for all time,

112
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,380
and can make it to our detectors even today,

113
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,500
but we choose to detect them and their presence

114
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,700
back on the surface of last scattering.

115
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,340
And that surface of last scattering

116
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,860
is an imprint, a fossil record of how the universe looked

117
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,540
when it was only 380,000 years old.

118
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,700
So we're kind of putting the detector system

119
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:51,380
back as close as we can to the source of the explosion,

120
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,740
if you will, if you think of inflation

121
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,420
as a sort of type of explosion

122
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,980
that ignited the big bang that we subsequently measured.

123
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,860
The results reported by bicep recently

124
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:04,580
indicate that we're below the 1% level of sensitivity.

125
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:07,660
The precision level needed to measure gravitational waves

126
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:10,220
has broken through the 1% barrier.

127
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,780
And even though the likelihood

128
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,500
of the gravitational wave signature

129
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,060
is slightly above a mere two-time multiple

130
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,460
of that one sigma result,

131
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,100
namely the two sigma upper limit,

132
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:24,100
is actually higher than the two times the 0.009

133
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,260
our precision level.

134
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,260
That's because the likelihood is slightly shifted over,

135
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:32,620
i.e. it looks to the naked eye, to the untrained brain

136
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,300
as if there's a slight detection

137
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,340
of gravitational wave energy, but there's not.

138
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,860
There's not significant enough to claim detection.

139
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,300
But the power and the procession

140
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,740
from the relatively crude measurements

141
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,380
that we made with bicep one,

142
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,220
and even other competing experiments,

143
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,500
including my own experiments, the polar bear experiment,

144
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,340
and other contemporary experiments,

145
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,540
have yet to approach anywhere

146
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,300
near this level of sensitivity.

147
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,820
Now, we hope to proceed even further back in time

148
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,660
and closer to the source

149
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,020
of primordial tensor perturbations if they exist.

150
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,340
And remember, the stakes could not be higher

151
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,460
because if inflation takes place,

152
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,980
many of the most prominent scientists

153
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,660
do believe that the multiverse paradigm

154
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,500
is also ushered into a state of believability,

155
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,020
maybe even proof by discovering this.

156
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,780
And that, we know for sure,

157
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,100
would be one of the conclusions

158
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,700
because that's what happened back in 2014

159
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,700
when bicep two made the premature discovery claim

160
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,460
that we had discovered gravitational waves

161
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:31,340
from the universe's inflationary epoch.

162
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,500
Now, that was retracted.

163
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,180
Later on, our conclusion was retracted.

164
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,020
We didn't make a blunder.

165
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,820
The experiment is exquisitely sensitive

166
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:37,900
and far more sensitive

167
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,420
than any other experiment ever done of this type.

168
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:43,660
But the interpretation as owing to a primordial cosmic event

169
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,900
rather than dust in the Milky Way galaxy

170
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:49,500
had to be essentially the disconfirmed result.

171
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,820
So we weren't able to establish this conclusively.

172
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,020
Now, it doesn't mean that gravitational waves

173
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:53,860
don't exist.

174
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,780
It doesn't mean inflation didn't take place.

175
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,980
It doesn't mean the multiverse isn't true.

176
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,340
But we would like to have evidence.

177
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:01,700
And so the bicep three team has now taken data

178
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,740
from more than just the one frequency we used in bicep two,

179
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,380
namely two millimeter wavelength,

180
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,700
150 gigahertz frequency.

181
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,620
Or with bicep one, we had three channels,

182
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,140
90 gigahertz, 150 gigahertz and 220 gigahertz.

183
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,540
But those detectors, the very few of those

184
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,820
operating in the higher frequency bands.

185
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,260
Now cosmic dust in our Milky Way galaxy

186
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:24,700
was the ultimate source of the large tensor to scalar ratio

187
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,980
we claimed back in 2014

188
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,620
and is the subject of losing the Nobel Prize.

189
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:34,620
But that was later found to be able to be removed

190
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,540
using data from the Planck satellite,

191
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,620
who were our competitors at the time

192
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:42,100
and still kind of frenemies and no, we're not enemies.

193
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,420
But we did eventually collaborate together

194
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:47,980
to reduce the uncertainty from dust

195
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,700
and actually show that dust could contribute

196
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,780
the dominant, the preponderance of the signal

197
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,460
that we claim to observe.

198
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,300
Now what's interesting is that bicep three

199
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,500
is able in the very near future, if not now,

200
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,020
to actually no longer need ancillary data

201
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,500
from another instrument, namely from the Planck satellite

202
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,900
to go deeper into the removal process

203
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,740
to get rid of the cosmic schmutz

204
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:11,180
that contaminates the local galactic neighborhood,

205
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,940
the dirty window, the dusty window that we must look through

206
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,020
with our cosmic instruments.

207
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,340
So it's fascinating to note that kind of the gauntlet

208
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,780
has been thrown down by this phenomenal team

209
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,860
that continues to work on a single goal.

210
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,860
And although there hasn't been a detection,

211
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,340
this is an important proving ground

212
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,660
because what it does is starts to eliminate

213
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:32,860
many, many classes, entire classes of models

214
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,300
of inflationary parameter space.

215
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,180
So we're able to really narrow down

216
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:39,660
and zoom in on the allowable regime

217
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:43,660
in which these inflationary models could have taken place.

218
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:46,620
Now, will we ever be able to rule out inflation?

219
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,220
I claim no because even if we don't ever observe

220
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,740
gravitational waves, we could still make the claim

221
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,780
that inflation took place, but the energy scale

222
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:57,700
of inflation was too low to manifest a observable background

223
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,060
of gravitational radiation that persisted

224
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,180
to this epoch of last scattering.

225
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:05,780
So we can't really falsify that inflation took place.

226
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:09,700
Some say that is a negative for the inflationary model

227
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,740
and it's non-comporting with the scientific method,

228
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,380
that things should be, as Karl Popper said, falsifiable

229
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,220
in order to constitute good science.

230
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,340
We've talked about that a lot.

231
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,580
I won't go into it again in more detail.

232
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,940
There are also haters of the inflationary theory

233
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,640
that because it posits the existence of a multiverse,

234
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,540
which some claim is antithetical to the scientific method

235
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,700
because everything that can possibly happen

236
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,380
does possibly happen.

237
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,620
And we'll talk about that in a future video as well

238
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,920
on the physics of free will coming soon.

239
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,100
So where are we?

240
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,260
We've ruled out a lot of inflationary models.

241
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:45,380
We would need to measure an inflationary gravitational

242
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,980
wave B mode signal that I've talked about

243
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,900
at length in other videos in order to conclusively

244
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,180
demonstrate the existence of these gravitational waves.

245
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:55,620
And that would be important because that would not only

246
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,860
help provide evidence for inflation

247
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,460
and maybe even narrow down even further

248
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,540
as much as humans could ever do narrowing down

249
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:05,300
the varying parameters that characterize

250
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,740
the inflationary universe.

251
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,740
It would also eliminate other contenders

252
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,500
for the cosmic genesis event.

253
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,060
In other words, it would eliminate things

254
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,820
like the bouncing model, the pyrotic model,

255
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,740
the conformal cyclic cosmology of Sir Roger Penrose,

256
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:20,380
the string gas cosmology of Robert Brandenburger

257
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,460
and Cameron Waffa that we'll talk about

258
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,220
in other videos on this channel.

259
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:27,860
So this non-detection is actually an important stepping stone

260
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,460
towards an ultimate measurement perhaps

261
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,660
of the cosmic genesis phenomenon

262
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,740
if indeed it did take place via inflation.

263
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,220
And if it didn't, we may see surprising results

264
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,380
along the way.

265
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,660
So these are really truly heroic results.

266
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:43,900
I'm happy for my former colleagues and friends

267
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,620
on the bicep experiment.

268
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,600
I wish them great success.

269
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,660
And of course with our small aperture telescopes

270
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:52,260
that we're building here at UC San Diego,

271
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,980
at Princeton University at UC Berkeley,

272
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,420
around the Simon's Observatory,

273
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,100
our small aperture telescopes,

274
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,120
these will hopefully set an important limit

275
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,600
or constraint or detection perhaps

276
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,140
of these primordial B mode polarization signals.

277
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:10,000
And I claim, this is my editorial opinion,

278
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,180
that one experiment cannot make a definitive claim anymore.

279
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:18,100
We will not be satisfied in this field of cosmology

280
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,720
unless two different experiments

281
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,020
can confirm the same type of signal.

282
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,580
They don't have to measure the exact same thing.

283
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,500
That's almost impossible in science.

284
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,260
They have to measure broad consistency

285
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,340
so that we can develop a consensus that inflation

286
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,180
took place.

287
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:34,380
If again, if indeed it did, who knows if it did.

288
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,700
But it's quite exciting to note

289
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,340
that no one can really go to the limits themselves.

290
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:42,460
No one goes to Stockholm themselves anymore.

291
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,780
We need to have confirmation if indeed this exists.

292
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:47,860
And I think that hopefully we will make great progress.

293
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,060
Again, as a scientist, you never wanna bias yourself

294
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,820
with the confirmation prejudice

295
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,140
that you are going to detect

296
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,460
that which you set out to detect

297
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,660
because it often leads you to reject things

298
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,620
that are perfectly acceptable

299
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,100
but just don't comport with your philosophical

300
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,780
or scientific worldview.

301
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,540
So for now, this exciting news

302
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:08,060
released from the BISEP team, the BISEP3 team

303
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,980
and eagerly awaiting new results

304
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,700
to come from this exciting field,

305
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,940
including results that will come from hopefully

306
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,280
right here at UC San Diego

307
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,460
and the Simons Observatory team around the world.
