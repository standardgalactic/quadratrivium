0	5520	The fear that comes out of whatever is left of the core community is you guys don't have a right
5520	11920	to go direct to a consumer. You don't have a right to talk about the field. That belongs to a tiny
11920	16720	number of people who do this morning, noon, and night who are all possessed of common beliefs.
16720	22160	There have to be some standards. On the other hand, the core group that's been trying to gate this has failed.
22160	30640	We have graciously been joined with two of the most prominent and two of my real heroes in this
30640	37680	field that are maverick mathematicians who are self-made mathematicians in a way. And I want to
37680	44720	talk about how they view the current spirit of the times as zeitgeist, as we say, in terms of
44720	51280	theories of everything that are percolating around in the atmosphere. And to begin with,
51280	57520	I'll ask my guest, Eric, to introduce yourself and say a little bit about where people can find
57520	62160	you. We'll do that right up front. And then we'll get started with our discussion topics. We're
62160	65440	going to have a nice clean fight. We're going toe to toe. No, there's not going to be any fight.
65440	71120	It's going to be very, very respectful. So thank you both for joining. Eric, can you introduce
71120	76160	yourself? And I'll buy me some time to tweet out this link. Check my feed. Eric Weinstein,
76240	83120	I'm a managing director at Teal Capital. I come from a mathematics background. So I'm not a
83120	92640	physicist. And I have an eclectic podcast called The Portal, which I hope to have. In fact, I've
92640	97760	got agreements from both of these gentlemen to be my guests on The Portal. So I'm really looking
97760	103600	forward to that and happy to help blow up into the impossible. Brian, you're doing a fantastic
103600	109040	job. I love it. And it's all thanks to you guys. You guys were actually my first guest in what I
109040	115520	call the pandemic podcast series, which began back in April, actually late March with Stephen.
116080	120000	It was the first of the two of you to come on the podcast and really kicked off this whole idea
120880	127040	of getting some of the world's most brilliant minds to engage around this topic of understanding
127040	132080	the fundamental nature of the universe. And at that time, because of the pandemic, perhaps,
132080	138400	Stephen's schedule was amenable to coming on my podcast. So we chatted for a mere three hours or
138400	143440	so. And he's, as I said, gracious enough to come back. Stephen, where are you joining us from today?
143440	151280	I'm in Concord, Massachusetts. And do I introduce myself? I'm Stephen Wolfram. I do science and
151280	157120	technology and things I've built. Some technology things lots of people use. I've built some science
157120	164560	lots of people use. And about 30 years ago, well, I used to be a particle physicist long ago.
165200	173440	I did that when I was a kid. And then I got interested in computation and have kind of
173440	179440	alternated between doing basic science and doing technology. And I've now done about five cycles
179440	184960	of that. And I think it's a very interesting process, actually, alternating between basic
184960	189360	science and technology, because they kind of build on each other. And it's sort of a
189360	196960	progressively spiral upwards, so to speak. But the big surprise for me was about a bit more
196960	201840	than a year ago now, a bunch of things that I've been thinking about, about how to make a fundamental
201840	208880	theory of physics. I actually thought, I think I actually have some way forward. And a couple of
208880	213360	young physicists were really enthusiastic about working with me on it. And so we're like, okay,
213360	219520	let's try and really do something. And the huge surprise is that it's worked. And which I didn't
219520	226640	expect. Yeah, I mean, it's, you know, we've been, we're at 100 years, roughly for, you know,
226640	231520	general relativity and quantum mechanics, which are the two sort of big achievements of 20th
231520	238800	century physics. And, you know, they've taken us a great distance. But, you know, I had a bunch
238800	243120	of ideas that have been sort of based on things that came out of the whole computational thinking
243120	249440	that I've done. And anyway, the big surprise that's worked, and not only that it seemed to have worked
249440	255440	when I last talked to you, it's been going absolutely spectacularly since then. And it's,
255440	259440	it's really, it's really, it's kind of like embarrassing, because there are a lot of things
259440	265520	I should have been able to figure out 20, 30 years ago, which are now becoming obvious. And I think
265520	271520	one of the other things to say is that one of the surprises to me is that I had thought we were
271520	277040	building this kind of prong in the direction of kind of computation that would be really different
277040	281600	from the mathematical physics and so on that people had done before. Turns out we basically
281600	286480	built a sort of a low level machine code for how things work. But it turns out an awful lot of the
286480	294160	formalisms that people have worked on in mathematical physics the last 50 years or so, they actually
294160	299280	fit beautifully into the kinds of things that we're doing. And they seem to kind of illuminate
299280	304480	what we've done and hopefully what we've done illuminates what they're doing. And I, I actually,
304480	309760	my favorite analogy in recent times for this is what happened in early days of computation theory
310400	314880	with things like Turing machines, which was that people had come up with, you know, models of
314880	320160	computation, combinators, lambda calculus, general recursive functions, things like this.
320160	324640	But it wasn't clear how they fit together. And they all seemed rather abstract. And people
324640	329520	couldn't kind of tether them. And then Turing machines came along. And, you know, in the usual
329520	334720	way that science history is done, we could say immediately everybody understood. But actually,
334720	340000	it took, let's see how long, 40 years, 50 years. So immediately it was actually 40 or 50 years.
340000	345920	But the people understood from from that kind of more concrete tethering of these ideas about
345920	350240	computation, how all these different things fit together. So that's been, that's been, I mean,
350240	355200	it's both both scientifically interesting to me. And I think also sociologically interesting,
355200	360640	because often, you know, you come in with the big new theory, so to speak. And it's like,
361680	365280	you're kind of gunning down everything else. But that's not what's happening here. I mean,
365280	369120	what's happening here is that we've got something which is sort of orthogonal to what other people
369120	375120	have thought about. It's kind of a low level, you know, low level machine code. And we can kind of,
375680	379760	you know, see how things fit together at a higher level. That's your elevator pitch that goes to
379760	385520	the space elevator stage docking station. Thank you, Steven. And both of you guys are notable,
385520	392160	as people are pointing out in the chat, which I'm monitoring. So behave in there. I am seeing a lot
392160	396000	of, you know, questions from younger people. And I think the two of you in particular,
396000	402560	have an ability that other scientists have not yet really been able to achieve, which is to
402560	407440	engage young people. And Steven, you just talked about engagement by these young physics students
407440	413600	that we and I spoke about in our first conversation back in April. And with Eric, people are,
413600	418960	you know, engaged on Discord, on comments, and people all over the Internet are really engaged
418960	424160	with it. What do you think it does? You know, this podcast, the Intangible Podcast, I like to
424160	429520	fashion myself as, you know, someday I'll be the Joe Rogan of physics. There's already one Joe Rogan.
429520	434400	But I'd like to know, what is it about these theories of everything that really engages young
434400	439040	people? And what I want to do is kind of translate. It's fascinating that you have this sort of bucket,
439040	446160	theories of everything. I don't kind of view it as a bucket like that. For me, you know, I spent my
446160	452000	life basically developing computation. And, you know, the fact that I happen to have discovered
452000	457440	that that relates to kind of fundamental theory of physics is kind of a singular event, as far as
457440	464320	I'm concerned. It's a kind of the bucket of theories of everything is not a bucket I particularly
464400	467920	identify with. Right. If I could agree with Stephen, there can only be one.
467920	470960	That was what I said today. There's a Highlander by Highlander.
470960	474080	One of the surprising things that we've discovered is that really isn't true.
474080	476880	There can be many ways of approaching that theory.
476880	481440	Yes. But the thing that's interesting is that, you know, you could say there's only,
482320	486400	fair enough, I mean, depends what you mean by only one. That's an interesting kind of ontological,
486400	490800	epistemological question. But I mean, it's like, you know, you could say about computation. There
490800	494880	could only be one theory of computation and it's Turing machines or it and its general recursive
494880	501520	functions. The thing that's surprising about physics that has become increasingly clear is that
501520	506960	the this kind of there's this notion of, you know, what are the possible, what are the underlying
506960	511840	rules? And then how do we observe those underlying rules? And it's becoming clear that you can
511840	518160	basically the only thing that is absolutely rigid is the underlying rules are computational
518160	523760	and not hyper computational. That is, once you say that the underlying rules are purely
523760	531120	computational, it then follows, it seems that the things we observe from 20th century physics
531920	538880	are inevitable consequences of that and a few other kind of unspecific assumptions.
538880	544080	It's a hard thing to explain. And actually, we're just, I think, okay, so here's a remarkable
544080	548880	connection that's just been becoming clear. So we have this notion of, you know, you have some
548880	555200	underlying rules, you follow these rules, you, you know, reproduce how the universe works.
555200	562400	But on the other side of that, we are observing how these rules are working and interpreting them
562400	570800	to say this is how the universe works. The thing that is surprising is that one can, I mean, in
570800	575040	the language of our kind of theory, there's this thing called the rural multiway system,
575040	581040	which is this kind of this branching system that's that runs sort of all possible rules.
581040	585520	And this is we're now jumping into the most abstract, most, most complicated. But I just
585520	589840	want to say one thing about it, which is kind of kind of interesting, which is it's turning out
589840	594800	that this incredibly abstract thing that we have this rural multiway system, appears to be the
594800	599920	same as this thing called the infinity groupoid, which was developed by growth and deek. And
599920	606560	when it was at the 70s, I guess, 1970s, which is kind of a pinnacle of abstraction of category
606560	611600	theory in other areas of mathematics. And what is really quite remarkable to me is that it seems
611600	616720	like this thing that's coming out of our theory kind of maps into this incredibly abstract
616720	624240	mathematical thing. And the observations that we have of the universe correspond to a particular,
624240	632000	in mathematical terms, kind of vibration of this infinity groupoid thing. And that basically what
632000	639680	we're our our way of interpreting the universe is kind of a slice of that of that mathematical
639680	646960	object. And so it's the statement, there's only one theory, in a sense, all these theories are
646960	653280	equivalent. But the, you know, the question is how how we are observing them. I was making a
653280	658960	pop culture reference. The intellectual spirit of it is that you can have a summit and there are
658960	666320	many faces that could be used as assaults on that summit. In the end, however we traverse,
666320	672640	you know, Einstein, for example, came up with his divergence free equations after some rumbling
672640	677840	around in differential geometry, Hilbert went, you know, immediately to a Lagrangian description,
677840	683600	they were describing something in common. So I didn't mean to suggest that there was a single
683600	691200	description, but there can really only be one underlying theory. And we all of us who are,
691200	696960	I was trying to agree with you, Steven, that the most probable number for wrong guests on this
696960	704480	live stream is two. But in all probability, if it is not two, then one of us is wrong. It strikes me
704480	709360	that you have gained confidence that what you are doing is actually not only capable
710080	715600	of producing a fundamental final theory. And we can talk about what the right language is,
715600	720560	I'm not wedded to any particular description, if you have an objection. But it sounds to me like
720560	729040	you are increasingly convinced that week by week, this is really the most promising assault
729040	736400	on our foundations. First of all, if I'm wrong, I hope that you or Garrett Leasy or one of these
736400	741040	other crazy people turns out to be right. It would be a pleasure to lose to you, sir.
741040	748640	The thing to understand is the kind of system that we've built, it is very likely that, you know,
748640	752080	I don't understand what you've done, but you know, I know a little bit of the mathematical
752080	757600	background, you know, the whole, for example, understanding local gauge invariance and understanding
757680	763040	how fiber bundles work in our systems, as a student actually at our recent summer school,
763040	768320	mathematical physicist, who managed to make great progress on that. And it's actually very clever
768320	774240	and much simpler than I expected. The way that essentially sort of fiber bundle type structures
774240	780480	and local gauge invariance arise in our theories. Now, what you do with it once it's arisen from
780480	785840	this kind of low level machine code, that's, you know, often running with much more traditional
785920	790480	mathematical physics. And I don't think that there's a, you know, it's not an incompatible thing to
790480	796160	say, oh, there's some complicated structure to do with, you know, high dimensional systems and
796160	801200	fiber bundles and so on. That doesn't, that's not like, there's no, there's no divide yet.
801200	807920	Let's try to state how you and I could both be fit into the discussion that Brian is trying to
807920	814400	conduct. One thing I definitely agree that, you know, conciliance is nice and it's wonderful to
814400	819760	have consonants what the viewers want as argumentation. I'm just kidding. I don't care about that,
819760	824960	but when I do, she gets Sabina back on. Exactly. I think it would be really a great outcome of this
824960	830000	discussion would be kind of the joining of your two different, different approaches. I don't know
830000	834160	about Eric's stuff. So I can't really comment on that. The people out in that are watching that
834160	840400	have, as you just said, fiber bundles, hop vibration, gauge invariance, but way of having
840400	845040	sort of a Rosetta Stone. If there are people out there, I'm not asking or asking you guys,
845040	851520	God forbid, with homework, but people in the respective domain experts in both of your two
851520	855840	categories, I think that would be an interesting kind of project to see. Can these be reconciled?
855840	859600	So maybe I should explain what we're doing. Okay, because there's a fairly large effort at this
859600	864480	point. What's been happening, you talk about engaging young people, you know, what I've been
864480	868320	trying to figure out how to do this, because there's been a lot of enthusiasm for our project,
868320	873040	a lot of people interested, a lot of people say, I want to contribute to this project. Okay.
873040	879440	So right now we have, we're just about to kind of roll out, I think we have 30 research affiliates
879440	884080	and junior research affiliates who are mostly people who came to the summer school that we just
884080	890080	spent a month having. And they're people who are sort of in motion, sort of doing research
890080	895040	along the lines of this project and, you know, producing papers and so on. And, you know, one
895040	899440	of the important objectives there, there's several important objectives, but one of them is
899440	906240	making these bridges to other kind of mathematical physics approaches. Another thing is just being
906240	911120	able to check off the list. There are, you know, these effects known in quantum mechanics, there
911120	917280	are these features of general activity, for example, can we go down the list and say, okay, you know,
917280	922640	we have destructive interference, we have spin statistics connections, we have this, we have
922640	927280	that. The thing that's just absolutely amazing is every time I think one of these is going to be
927280	932320	really hard, it turns out to be much easier than I think. And that's been a big surprise to me. I
932320	939440	mean, I've been, my expectations keep on being kind of exceeded. And I think that the, I mean,
939440	943680	the other question is, for example, for something like general activity, which I know, you know,
943680	949680	you have a lovely cosmic microwave background globe and the back there, it's some right,
950400	954880	it's very cool. Yeah, it's weird that it's kind of the inversion of the sky, so to speak.
954880	960480	Yeah, God's I view, right. Yeah, right. You know, so for example, there's the, you know,
960480	966480	we have a sort of mathematical proof that in some limit, we can reproduce general activity.
966480	972080	But the question is, can you actualize that? And so here's an interesting example of how sort of,
972640	977040	you know, a direction we're going in, which is an interesting sort of way to validate theories,
977040	982240	the following thing. So when people normally study gravitation theory, they say, oh, we've
982240	987680	got Einstein's equations from 1915, they work great. But if we actually want to find out her
987680	993120	two black holes merge, we don't get to kind of work out, you know, with Mathematica or something,
993120	998160	the exact, you know, result for, you know, how this black hole merger will work, we have to
998160	1002720	make numerical approximations to the Einstein equations, sort of break them down into something
1002720	1009520	discreet, solve them on a computer, see what the implications for this process are. But that,
1009520	1014080	that kind of break down the Einstein equations into something discreet that can be solved on a
1014080	1018720	computer, there's an alternative way to think about that, which is start from our theory,
1018720	1025040	which is born as something that you can run on a computer, and then go up from there to get to
1025040	1029120	something which can reproduce what happens in black holes and so on. And so, you know,
1029120	1033280	this is the kind of thing I happened to do this years ago with fluid dynamics,
1033280	1038080	where you can start with these very simple, in that case cellular automaton models of fluid dynamics
1038080	1042320	and build up from those to actually reproduce fluid phenomena. But anyway, so the thing is
1042320	1047040	what I might call proof by compilation, so to speak, which is you're going from the kind of
1047040	1053040	low level structure of the model to actually do computations that can then be compared with
1053040	1056960	black hole dynamics, even though you sort of know it has to work, because you have a mathematical
1056960	1061120	proof that the two things are equivalent. But it's very satisfying to see it actually work,
1061120	1065920	it hasn't, we haven't, you know, done that yet, but we're in the process of doing it.
1066480	1070320	And more interestingly, actually in quantum field theory, where numerical methods have been much
1070320	1075600	harder to apply, it looks like we have a pretty good way to do sort of numerical quantum field
1075600	1080480	theory in a different way than it's been done before. When you say it's easy, by what metric
1080480	1087200	or what measure function are you defining that? Easy in terms of, you know, just easy for a brilliant,
1087200	1093360	you know, grandmaster of physics to unravel, or easy in terms of computational efficiency in some
1093360	1098160	sense? No, I mean, for example, one of the things is, do we have to know how electrons work to be
1098160	1103280	able to, or do we have to know what photons in detail are before we can reproduce effects in
1103280	1109440	quantum mechanics? The answer is, a lot of these phenomena seem to be more generic than I expected
1109440	1117920	and more amenable to being kind of explained without having that whole tower of features built.
1117920	1124560	So that's the main thing I mean by easier. I think in terms of the technical difficulty
1124560	1129040	and the mathematical depth of what's going on, we're doing what physicists often do, which is
1129040	1134080	we're skating over many of the mathematical difficulties. I mean, in some of these derivations,
1134080	1138880	there are like 12 different limits that have to be taken of, you know, this thing is small
1138880	1142640	compared to the size of the universe, but large compared to this, but small compared to the curvature
1142640	1147840	of that, but large compared to this and so on. And, you know, each one of those limits is a
1147840	1153360	significant amount of mathematical work to validate and so on. And, you know, this is the
1153360	1157920	typical thing that's been done by physicists through the ages, I'm afraid, that just skate
1157920	1162160	right over those things. Now, we have a big advantage, which was you can do computer experiments. So
1162160	1165760	we kind of know it's going to work. I mean, we know we're not going to be too far off because
1165760	1170800	we can actually check a bunch of these things in actual experiments. Although the experiments we do,
1170800	1174560	you know, if the universe has 10 to the 400, you know, atoms of space in it,
1175120	1179280	we certainly don't have that many in our computer. So we're doing very small versions of this.
1179280	1183600	You know, I want to say that I think it might be interesting for us to talk a little bit about
1183600	1188960	kind of the more sort of societal and structural aspects rather than getting too deep into the
1188960	1194400	into the. Sure. Wait a minute. I was looking to get, I wanted to get into the into the damn weeds.
1194480	1198080	Go for it. We will. We will. But yeah, small, small amount of weed,
1198880	1203360	weed whacking. And then then we can talk about some the bigger picture of science and the world
1203360	1208240	and so on, which I think I think we probably both have things to say about. I think that segues
1208240	1213760	nicely into a question that I brought up with with both of you separately and then earlier
1213760	1219840	today. And that's kind of the structure of the way that scientific revolutions take place. And
1219840	1225120	it's become a trope, you know, nowadays to say there's a paradigm shift, which is brought upon
1225120	1230880	by some new idea, radical, usually some lone genius like you guys working almost in solitude.
1230880	1234720	I'm just teasing, but just going to get us into trouble with Reddit. That's all you're doing.
1234720	1239680	You're just bathing Reddit. Well, hopefully Dr. Reddit is not watching yet. I guarantee she is.
1239680	1244000	What do you think about this notion of paradigm shifts? Do you think it's really the way that
1244000	1250000	science takes place? Or is it just sort of a retro retrospective, retradiction, historical
1250000	1255040	narrative of what has taken place that is just convenient as a hack for the human mind to say,
1255040	1260160	okay, in retrospect, the paradigm shifted with Galileo's observation of the Jovian satellites.
1260160	1265280	What do you, Eric, think about this notion of CUNY and paradigm shifting? You have to
1265920	1271600	have lived through stasis and stagnation and through revolution and boom.
1272560	1278000	And even if the boom isn't the largest boom on record, like, you know, the Gold Rush or something,
1278000	1283920	in science, I lived through one or two revolutions, one of which was a Rosetta Stone between
1283920	1290160	differential geometry and quantum field theory, or at least the structure underneath quantum field
1290160	1295280	theory that was figured out in the mid 1970s. It doesn't have a historical, like you can't go to a
1295360	1304080	biopic about it, which is weird. But your friend Jim Simons, Brian, and C. N. Yang, arguably,
1304080	1310320	maybe the greatest of living physicists, figured this out over lunch. And that revolution is going
1310320	1315360	on to this day called the Wu Yang Dictionary. There was another one having to do with the
1315360	1320880	discovery that quantum field theory was a mathematically natural structure, not just a
1320880	1326000	grab bag of techniques, and that it would have been discovered as an enhancement of something
1326000	1332000	in algebraic topology, since Dr. Wolfram brings up Alexander growth and deke. In algebraic topology,
1332000	1336960	we have a theory called boredism, which is an extraordinary homology theory, and quantum field
1336960	1344160	theory would be discovered in enhancing boredism theory, as Ed Whitten, Michael Atiyah, and Graham
1344160	1349760	Siegel and others taught us in the 1980s. Having seen revolutions, yes, there are things that you
1349760	1357040	can tell people where they're never the same again. They come to understand, as I've said before,
1357040	1362640	there should be a tattoo on all of our cecums. If you can read this, you're too close. When you
1362640	1370000	pull your head out, you can better understand the world after the revolution. And what Dr.
1370000	1377360	Wolfram is discussing is that we've had a small number of complete revolutions in our thinking,
1377360	1383360	and many more minor elaborations in our thinking. There was one around scale, which might be called
1383360	1389280	the first and second renormalization revolutions, originally a Feynman and Schwinger, but then
1389280	1394560	Ken Wilson really was probably the big name in that area. Having been through a few of these
1394560	1399520	revolutions, having been close enough to study them, and also in a few different fields like
1399520	1404800	biology with, you know, CRISPR-Cas9 or optogenetics or something like this, yeah, no, these things
1404800	1412080	are real. And they change everything. And, you know, my resistance to Stephen's theory will one day
1412080	1416720	turn into, you know, my saying, oh, my God, I can't believe I didn't understand what you were
1416720	1422320	saying. It was too new to use Feynman's famous quote from when he tried to introduce his path
1422320	1427440	integral or path sum over history's approach. He said, my machines came from too far away,
1427440	1431520	because he was derided. And you see a lot of people, we were talking before about Reddit,
1431520	1435840	just to close this out. A lot of people are trying to figure out what the hell is going on in these
1435840	1440240	live streams, and why does one person get to be in them, and who's a crank, and who isn't.
1440240	1445200	They're trying to use some sort of indicia, which is, does that person sound like their wild eye?
1445200	1449760	Does that person sound sober? And it's a really odd moment, because on the one hand,
1449760	1454880	everybody sounds crazy, and some of the crazy people sound among the most sane. And I think Dr.
1454880	1459760	Wolfern, for example, despite the fact that I think he's wrong, I think that he is one of the
1459760	1465360	sanest voices out here, one of the most interesting for sure. And part of the problem is the mainstream
1465360	1470560	of the community sounds mad as a hatter to me, and Dr. Wolfern sounds much more reasonable.
1470560	1475840	So let's comment on paradigm shifts and so on. I've been fortunate to live through some myself,
1475840	1480320	even probably responsible for some. The main process that seems to happen is,
1480880	1486720	a methodological advance is made, that opens up some new area, there's a bunch of low hanging
1486800	1491040	fruit to be picked in that area. Lots of exciting stuff happens for five years,
1491040	1497840	10 years, maybe a little bit longer. That area of science gets big, it gets quite institutionalized,
1497840	1503200	it slows down, there's 50 or 100 years of sort of stasis, and then maybe there's some methodological
1503200	1509520	advance and it opens up again. And typically, in terms of sort of the conceptualization of
1509520	1515520	these methodological advances, it's usually a long process for the people involved in them,
1515520	1519600	and it's usually, you know, you have to sort of think about things in the right way,
1519600	1524160	and then maybe there's some moment when you realize, yes, I can actually see how this works. Now,
1524160	1529360	for example, in my current activities in physics, you know, one of the embarrassments of that is
1529360	1534720	that the fundamental model, which is based on, you can think of it as based on rewritings of
1534720	1542800	hypergraphs or very minimalist, very sort of abstract thing about transformations for relations
1542800	1550160	between elements. And that idea you can also think of as transformation rules for symbolic
1550160	1555360	expressions. Well, the idea of transformation rules for symbolic expressions is what I've been
1555360	1561920	using technologically in building computational languages for 40 years. And it is super embarrassing,
1561920	1567760	in a sense, that the core idea, which seems to have unlocked what we're doing now in physics,
1567760	1572000	is actually something that I've been working on for 40 years. But I didn't see that connection,
1572080	1578080	I mean, what's happened is that normally, in using symbolic expressions and transformation
1578080	1582160	rules for symbolic expressions in computational languages, those symbolic expressions actually
1582160	1588800	immediately mean something. They mean, you know, adding things together, they mean, I don't know,
1588800	1594960	some other identifiable kind of operation. Whereas in the way we're using them in physics,
1594960	1599840	it's just the infrastructure, they mean nothing. They get meaning because the things in them turn
1599840	1605360	into the things like the atoms of space and so on. But to begin with, they mean nothing. So for me,
1605360	1609840	that's sort of an interesting case, because it's something which has been right under my nose for
1609840	1615920	40 years. And it took that amount of time for me to have the right sort of conceptual framework
1615920	1621200	to see how it could be applied in this particular case. And, you know, I think that's, I mean,
1621200	1627120	this is a question of kind of how people, you know, how these paradigm shifts and so on,
1627200	1632720	kind of land in the world. I mean, okay, so there's one big one that I've been deeply involved in,
1632720	1639360	which is the whole idea of using computation and programs as models of the world, instead of using
1639360	1644880	mathematical equations as models of the world. So you roll the clock back, you know, 300 or so
1644880	1651200	years, we get to Galileo and Newton and so on. And they had the problem of explaining to people,
1651200	1656080	no, you can't just reason about how the world works, you can write down a mathematical equation
1656080	1661840	and solve it and that will tell you how the moon moves or something. And, you know, at that time,
1662880	1667360	it was a sort of complicated battle to have people realize, yes, you can just, you know,
1667360	1670960	solve the mathematical equation, it will tell you how the world works. It's not a question of
1670960	1676960	reasoning about it. Okay, 300 years go by. And then we're at the point where, oh, mathematical
1676960	1681280	equations are the way the world works. Is there some other way to describe how the world works?
1681280	1685200	No, no, no, they can't possibly be another way to describe how the world works. You know,
1685280	1690800	when I started thinking about kind of generalizing sort of rules for how the world works and
1690800	1694800	thinking about simple programs and what they do and kind of exploring the computational
1694800	1698240	universe of simple programs, I would say, actually, looking back on it's interesting,
1698240	1703520	you know, I published this big book called a new kind of science back in 2002. I would say that
1703520	1708720	many fields were really quite receptive to what I had to say. Fundamental physics was actually one
1708720	1713200	of the one of the only exceptions. What was interesting there was, you know, some people said,
1713200	1716800	oh, you know, programs, we don't need programs to describe the world, mathematical equations
1716800	1723200	do just fine. Okay, now you look just maybe 15 years later. And if you look at new models that
1723200	1728000	people are inventing of things, they are overwhelmingly based on programs, not based on
1728000	1732800	mathematical equations. There's a dark story underneath this, which is that as tech has been
1732800	1738000	really the, and by tech, I really mean computation, because most of the rest of technology seems to
1738000	1744560	have vanished as computation became the one bright spot in a relatively stagnant world.
1745440	1750320	And I hate to say it that way. There are caveats, but let's let's keep going.
1751680	1758160	It came to be that many people started to dress up whatever they were doing in terms of computation,
1758880	1764160	right, because it was possible to seek, you know, funding from a Yuri Milner or a Mark Zuckerberg,
1764160	1768160	or, dare I say, a Jeffrey Epstein, you know, all of these sorts of things,
1769360	1776000	which had exotic funding sources or possible prizes around them in computation. It also
1776000	1780960	became the case that funders were more eager at the government level to hear a proposal for
1780960	1786240	something having a computational nature. So the problem that we have is, is that there were all
1786240	1793440	of these old ideas about, you know, of anointment, of Schrodinger, of Hawking, etc., etc., touring
1794000	1800080	about the world as a computer. And at the moment, there's a system of selective pressures that
1800080	1805200	partially has to do with how difficult it is to fund one's research. So I don't want, I'm very
1805200	1810240	worried about the event horizon of the computational paradigm. It's absolutely true what Stephen is
1810240	1816160	saying, that this is torn through theoretical physics, but I'm very dubious as I was.
1816160	1819280	No, it hasn't. No, it hasn't. Not theoretical physics. No, it hasn't.
1819280	1825120	The people aren't necessarily doing what you're saying, but they are dressing things up in terms
1825120	1831520	of computation. So I think your interesting points, I think not quite right. Okay, so you're
1831520	1835280	absolutely right that in theoretical physics, for example, quantum computing has become this
1835280	1838880	giant, you know, a fundable thing. We can talk about that separately.
1838880	1844000	Or black hole information paradoxes, or the idea of the universe as a computer, John Wheeler had
1844000	1849600	old points, but that feel. But that's not what I'm talking about. That's not what I'm talking about.
1849600	1854240	What I'm talking about is, there is a way of thinking about doing science that says,
1854240	1858960	you write down an equation, you can solve this equation, and it will tell you how the world
1858960	1863600	is going to work. Computational scientific material is sort of the old line of reductionism,
1863600	1867680	which is if we could just solve these equations, we get beautiful, closed-form solutions.
1867680	1875520	The surprising thing that, you know, I really got serious about in the 1980s was this phenomenon
1875520	1881520	where if what you think is going on is that it's just following computational rules,
1881520	1886240	then that doesn't work anymore. There's this phenomenon of computational irreducibility
1886240	1891120	where the system is doing what it does, and it's doing a computation, and we're trying to figure
1891120	1895680	out what the system does, and we're also doing a computation, and there's this thing I call the
1895680	1900400	principle of computational equivalence, which is basically the statement or the claim, which we're
1900400	1905680	getting more and more evidence for, that our ability to think through what a system does
1905680	1910480	is of the same level of computational sophistication as what the system itself does.
1910480	1916080	So we never get to outrun the system. We don't get to do what has been the kind of banner story
1916160	1922240	of a lot of traditional mathematical science, which is find this reduction, this reducible
1922240	1927520	computation where we can just say, and the system is going to do this. We're kind of stuck.
1927520	1931840	There's the issue about whether we can compute it out once we find the rules.
1931840	1936480	So the idea is that you could imagine a world in which Maxwell's equations are perfect, you know,
1936480	1942400	all the way down, and you still might not be able to compute the consequences of Maxwell's equations
1942560	1948000	like the Einstein equations like Navier-Stokes. It happens, but it's very obscure in those
1948000	1952560	equations, because when you look at the Navier-Stokes equations, the standard equations for fluid
1952560	1958560	flow, one of the most notable features of fluid flow is fluid turbulence. Fluid flows quickly,
1958560	1963760	it looks kind of random. You say to people who study the Navier-Stokes equations, can you reproduce
1963760	1967600	that from the underlying equations? Is that something that's in the underlying equations,
1967680	1972160	or is it maybe a sign of some, you know, smaller scale molecular processes that are
1972160	1976640	getting amplified, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera? So they'll typically get, I mean, these days they
1976640	1981120	have a lot of empirical ways to do it, but if you really push on the fundamental question,
1981120	1983280	they'll get kind of embarrassed because they just don't know.
1983280	1987760	It's like quark confinement. If you know the rules of quarks, can you prove that they're
1987760	1992400	not never going to be found in isolation and only going to be found typically in hadrons?
1993360	1999360	Yeah, that's a similar thing, which actually has, that particular one actually has a more
1999360	2005120	direct story of... Let's all agree that we're modern people and we don't have the old reductionist
2005120	2011120	dream. That's a non-trivial point because in theoretical physics, that point has not yet been
2011120	2016400	understood. Well, I think it has. I think that the extent to which we talk about what is emergent,
2016960	2022640	what is not, what is enthropic, what is not, we now have many concepts, including, you know,
2022640	2028240	galois sorts of, not galois, girdle sorts of concerns that are cropping up in theoretical
2028240	2033280	physics. Finally, yes. I wrote the paper about undersideability in theoretical physics back
2033280	2038880	in the early 1980s. I think it needs to be said, you know, again, by somebody who hopes to be your
2038880	2044240	competitor, that you were very early on a lot of these topics. You weren't doing it as part of a
2044240	2049040	fad. You were in fact the pioneer coming out of the computational ability of mathematics and all
2049040	2053920	that you've set up. And you've wrapped some beautiful libraries with many more functions than
2053920	2059440	anybody ever thought we could have. So, you know, kudos to you. There was a huge resistance inside
2059440	2065120	of theoretical physics because it was a very closed, arrogant community. It had many reasons to be
2065120	2072400	arrogant. It has fewer reasons to be arrogant now. And so in part, I think that you were dismissed
2072400	2077280	unfairly. It's very important that you not be the one to blow your own horn. So I would be happy
2077280	2082560	to say that I remember when that book came out, I remember the derision, the anger didn't seem to
2082560	2089600	come from anywhere in particular. And it was not listened to properly, even though I don't think
2089600	2096160	that it actually is doing what you say it's doing now. But one, happy to be wrong. And it was always
2096160	2100560	a really important point that you were making within that. I just don't think that it really
2101040	2104880	hurt. What do you make of that, Steven? Hold on a second. I want to just correct that impression.
2104880	2112480	Because the fact is, you know, I was looking at this recently, right? Insofar as there was
2112480	2117920	negativism about that book, where did it actually come from? Because there was tons of positivism.
2117920	2125600	I mean, the negativism, it turns out, was specifically concentrated in people who did
2125600	2132640	fundamental physics. And if you look outside of that area, it was not negativism, it was actually
2132640	2137680	a lot of positivism. But to steal man the critics, which I hate to do, the critics have a feeling
2137680	2143360	that there's a tiny number of fields where it's very difficult to check people. It's very hard to
2143360	2149120	say when a theoretical physicist is bullshitting. It's very hard to say when a theoretical, very pure
2149200	2156880	mathematician is speaking nonsense. So there is this fear. How do we know that what he's saying
2156880	2162000	in some sense is correct? Correct enough to interrupt, but correct enough to devote
2162000	2166640	many precious hours to unravel it. There's that, but there's not that much to unravel
2166640	2170240	at the moment. So I'm not that sympathetic with that. You know, this is sort of Sabine. I don't
2170240	2175120	have time for this stuff. My feeling is, to hell you don't have time. There's almost nothing happening.
2175120	2180800	Now, with that said, what I think is, is that there was a fear that quite honestly people like
2180800	2187280	you and like myself are cheating. And just I want to be open about this. The fear that comes out of
2187280	2192720	whatever is left of the core community is you guys don't have a right to go direct to a consumer.
2192720	2198800	You don't have a right to talk about the field that belongs to a tiny, the privilege of a tiny
2198800	2203680	number of people who do this morning, noon and night, who are all possessed of common beliefs.
2203680	2207920	And that's something that both you and I have been fighting. Now, I would also suggest that
2207920	2214480	Stephen and I probably are not eager to open the door to every lunatic with a red crayon who
2214480	2219520	wants to scribble something on a roll of paper towels and say that they've got a unified theory.
2219520	2224240	So there have to be some standards. On the other hand, the core group that's been trying to gate
2224240	2230800	this has failed. It was historically interesting to me. So I was, you know, I did particle physics
2230800	2236240	during its kind of golden age in the late 1970s when I was a late teenager, so to speak.
2236240	2242960	And I think I did pretty well. You know, a bunch of I got, you know, got was was sort of pretty
2242960	2247440	successful in the field. And I wrote a bunch of papers that still get cited because I lived in
2247440	2252240	the sort of golden age and not a lot came after that. I mean, not because they were necessarily,
2252880	2256720	you know, there was a question of picking low hanging fruit. And so that meant that I
2256720	2261840	know a large fraction of the kind of leading people in theoretical physics above some age.
2261840	2269120	I was quite surprised by the level of kind of angst when new kind of science came out.
2269120	2273920	But the typical thing that I heard was, oh, my gosh, if this is right, what we've been doing for
2273920	2278400	the last 50 years, all has to be thrown away. And I kept on saying, I don't think that's what's
2278400	2284320	going to happen. You know, and people would say to me like, you know, I was I was noticing, I think
2284400	2288320	I made a you know, wrote a sort of historical piece about this. And I described it as
2288320	2293440	Nobel Prize winners with pitchforks. And so there was a was a quite a parade. It was quite it's
2293440	2297600	quite kind of interesting looking back on it. I was going to send one of them an email actually,
2297600	2302240	just when my new thing came out. And then the person went and died. So they die or they soften.
2302240	2308000	I think what was interesting to me was at that time, 20 years ago, there was a lot of kind of,
2308880	2313040	you know, we're going to make it string theory is going to do it. We're almost there. You know,
2313040	2316480	we don't need anything else. I think that's changed now.
2316480	2320880	That's about 1984 through 86, when the string mania was at its height.
2320880	2327760	No, I think that, you know, now, you know, we've got a lot of mostly younger physicists
2327760	2333200	who are pretty seriously working on this stuff. And I think, you know, it's it's going great.
2333760	2340640	Of the older crowd, you know, I sort of been in contact with a large fraction of them. And it's
2340640	2345040	like, Oh, this seems interesting. And it's like, you should actually work on this. I keep on telling
2345040	2349200	him you should actually work on it. And some of them have, you know, been on live streams,
2349200	2352480	we've done and things like that. And we certainly talked about things. But I think,
2352480	2357040	you know, a lot of people, they do something for a living. And this isn't what they do for a living.
2357040	2361920	And I don't know whether they'll kind of make the effort to kind of turn what the change what
2361920	2366960	they do for a living. I don't know whether it matters. I think that the the concept that,
2367200	2372880	you know, it is probably particularly 20 years ago, it was still the case that the kind of
2372880	2378240	institutional structure of things like physics was very strong. As in, it was like, we have
2378240	2382720	this institutional structure, and this is how this field is going to work. And we don't do anything
2382720	2387040	from the outside. My impression is that that's weakened in the intervening years. But maybe
2387040	2393680	I'm wrong. The perception that I get from comments from people is almost like being
2393680	2399200	candid with both of you as friends. On one hand, Eric is criticized for a complexity,
2399920	2407040	a technical, you know, sort of toolkit that is beyond even many theoretical physicists. So,
2407040	2411040	you know, I disagree that, you know, they'll say, I don't have enough time, but but it is true that
2411040	2416320	there's, you know, general stock and trade of a theoretical cosmologist is not necessarily
2416320	2421360	hop vibrations, fiber bundles, etc. It might be perturbation theory, it might be quantum field
2421360	2427840	theory. And on the other side of the coin, Steven, I think sometimes the perception is it's too
2427840	2433440	simplistic, not in the sense or it's too elementary. It's too fundamental in the sense that you use
2433440	2437520	in your in your wonderful new book, which you're kind of enough to send to me. And congratulations
2437520	2442320	for writing a shorter book than a new kind of science, I think by about 40 pages. Brian gets a
2442320	2447200	copy. I think Steven will send you one or I'll give you one when we get together. I've got multiple
2447200	2452960	copies. But Steven, you know, so let me let me just start with with you for a second. Eric knows
2452960	2456720	his critics, he knows what people say, and I think he brings up a good point. Wait, I have
2456720	2461280	critics, this is the first I hear of this, Brian. There's two, one's named Pia something and the
2461280	2466640	other one. But Steven, in your case, I think it's absolutely correct that, you know, people are
2466640	2471680	blown away by the contributions. I have people, you know, asking me to thank you from the depths
2471680	2477680	of their heart for for Mathematica for new kind of science that in some ways, it's amazing that
2477680	2482560	you guys have, I get comments, I'm reading them, you save my life, you touch my life, you change
2482560	2488560	my life. It's so amazing. But on the other hand, I think that that in in real scientific circles,
2488560	2495040	oftentimes breeds a class of almost undermining and let me explain something which is which I
2495040	2502800	think is interesting. So I am that people think what I've done is simplistic is a great compliment
2502800	2507840	because I've spent a huge amount of effort trying to take the things that I'm thinking about and
2507840	2512880	make them simple enough that both I can understand them well, and I can explain them well. When I
2512880	2518240	wrote new kind of science, I even said this in the introduction, I said, the fact that this appears
2518240	2524240	to be very simple, appears to be very straightforward, will make people who thought, you know, who work
2524320	2529760	on technical science think that, you know, they must, they must really understand this and this
2529760	2535760	must be something simple and irrelevant. It isn't true. You know, the fact is, it is, it is much
2535760	2540400	more difficult, at least for me, maybe it isn't for everybody, but I think it probably is for
2540400	2546240	almost everybody, to turn things into things that can be described simply than it is to kind of,
2546240	2550800	you know, maybe there's a certain challenge to sort of building up the tower of being able to
2550800	2556240	talk about, you know, fiber bundles and self-dual connections and all this kind of thing, but,
2556240	2561600	but that's a, it's a well-defined tower you have to climb. So, for example, right now, I happen to
2561600	2567120	be working on kind of a very bizarre thing that, again, I never thought would come out, which is
2567120	2574160	a kind of a, a general theory of metamathematics. So in mathematics, one, one thinks about, you
2574160	2577760	know, there's the particular mathematics people do, the three million theorems of mathematics
2577760	2582000	that have been published in the literature of mathematics and human history, but then there's
2582000	2587440	the kind of full metamathematics of all possible theorems. And the remarkable thing is that it
2587440	2592880	looks like we can actually derive kind of the analog of Einstein's equations in metamathematical
2592880	2600400	space, a very bizarre. We keep coming to this point. I want to just put a pin here just in case
2600400	2610560	it's of interest. I don't think that it's very difficult to imagine recovering Einstein's equations
2610560	2616160	given Hilbert's contribution so that we know in a weird sense that Einstein did something very,
2616160	2621200	very difficult. And I've compared it to Half Dome where there's a sheer face that Einstein went up,
2621200	2625440	and then there's this gentle face that Hilbert went up after he knew that it could be climbed.
2625440	2630640	It seems to me that because we know that Einstein's equations results from the simplest
2630640	2636000	objective function that you could have, which is the scalar curvature in Rouhani and geometry,
2636000	2641840	that that's not a great target. I mean, it's great that you can produce something that looks like
2641840	2648480	Einstein's theory out of computational rules. The next one on the list would be Yang-Mills
2648480	2658000	theory. They're only really four basic equations. Again, the objective function is as simple as
2658000	2665440	it gets. So to Stephen's point, what we know about the current physical world is that two out of the
2665440	2671040	four equations, fundamental equations for the fields, the things that dance in our world and we call
2671040	2676640	particles or waves, both of those come from the simplest possible curvature equations that one
2676640	2681360	can have in geometry. So if you think of the geometries largely about curvature, then the two
2681360	2686880	simplest structures that can generate equations called the Yang-Mills Lagrangian or the Yang-Mills
2686880	2692480	Maxwell Lagrangian, which is just you take the size of the curvature and you square it and that's
2692480	2697840	it. And the other one is you just take a piece of the curvature without squaring it when you have
2697840	2702160	a piece to take called the scalar curvature and that's it. The other two equations have a slightly
2702160	2708640	different character. I want to leave aside the Higgs field and what we would call the Klein-Gordon
2708640	2714960	equation with the potential. But I would say the next order of business is do you find the Dirac
2714960	2723360	equation? Because it's very difficult to find spinners arising from computational rules.
2723840	2732640	So the answer is do we know how we managed to get spinner representations in the rotation group?
2732640	2738160	We know how to construct these things. There is a mystery about why they are there to construct.
2738160	2742320	Now there are people who will go to their graves saying there is no mystery, I know how to construct
2742320	2747760	it, therefore I know what it is, which is never true. I mean we only really understand something
2747760	2751600	in mathematics when we can walk all around it and see it from many different angles.
2752560	2757680	I agree that we know how to construct spinners, I know how to construct Dirac operators,
2757680	2763840	but this is a highly non-trivial question in our world. It comes out of what I call the psychedelic
2763840	2768960	of mathematics, the square root construction, where you ask a question like what is x squared
2769920	2774480	equals minus one? It has no solution in the reels. You have to jump into another space
2775040	2780960	in order to answer the question. So it has this different character which is the answer to the
2781040	2787600	problem isn't found in the space in which the problem was posed. In the case of Einstein's
2787600	2791840	equations and in the Yang-Mills equations or the souped up version of Maxwell's equations,
2791840	2799120	non-linear Maxwell theory if you will, you have something which has a character where I understand
2799120	2803760	where it comes from. In the case of the Dirac equation, you have got much bigger problems.
2803760	2809520	I tried to bring this up in the last live stream, it didn't work at all. What do you do in quantum
2809600	2817760	gravity when you don't have an observation of the metric, for example, and therefore you cannot
2817760	2823920	construct the ocean in which the electron is a wave? Now, if you think about it very carefully,
2824640	2830720	in a weird way, electrons are basically functions and photons are basically derivative operators.
2831760	2838320	That's a bizarre way to think about it. I know the mathematical physics, so I understand what
2838320	2844160	you're talking about. Then you wouldn't say it's a bizarre way at all, I don't think in any event.
2844160	2849840	What we're talking about is we're talking about versions of the xy plane and functions and
2849840	2855760	derivatives. The idea of the xy plane that grows up to become something called fiber bundles which
2855760	2860880	Stephen mentioned at the beginning. The idea of functions grows up to be something called sections
2860880	2866720	and the idea of derivatives grows up to be something called connections. These are the basic bread and
2866720	2873200	butter of what goes on before you get to the quantum. In that picture, there's a big difference
2873200	2880400	between recovering the easiest bits and recovering the hardest bits. I don't mean to put extra weight
2880400	2888160	on Stephen's shoulders. If he can do the first bits, that's great, but there's a series of challenges
2888160	2894640	that are of escalating difficulty in terms of recovery because of the simplicity of some portions
2894640	2899040	of our model and the Baroque complexity of other portions of the model. For example, the internal
2899040	2903600	quantum number assignments that give the particles their personality, the number of generations,
2903600	2911280	the chirality of the situation. It's very interesting. Stephen's rules are going to have to pick a left
2911280	2916240	or a right, so it's very interesting to how he's going to recover a chiral world.
2916240	2924000	This is silly. Let me give you my point of view here. We can talk about details of mathematical
2924000	2930320	physics. It's quite interesting. I know you know a bunch about it. We can go deeply into
2931520	2939920	how half-interjust spin versus interjusting particles work, etc. What you're doing is you're
2939920	2947040	making the paradigm shift mistake. You're talking about things in terms of existing mathematical
2947040	2952480	physics ideas. Yes, you're saying, oh my gosh, you'll never be able to get spinners.
2952640	2958720	No, I'm just saying let me just make a few points about this. Okay, I mean the fact is
2960240	2965680	we're actually hot on the trail of understanding how fermions versus bosons work. It's quite
2965680	2973520	interesting. It has to do, it seems, with cases where in our, and again, it's sort of a somewhat
2973520	2980240	complicated story, but it's these branch pairs and branch shield space, whether they end up being
2980240	2986560	things that merge after a small number of steps or not, seems to be what is the distinguishing
2986560	2991360	feature between bosons and fermions, how that relates to half-interjust spin. We don't completely
2991360	2996640	know. It seems to be related to various features of homotopy in the multi-way causal graph.
2997680	3002160	It's quite possible that some of the kinds of mathematical physics that you like a lot are
3002160	3007920	highly relevant in understanding how that homotopy works in the multi-way causal graph. It looks like
3007920	3012640	a limit of the multi-way causal graph is quite possibly related to Twister theory,
3012640	3018240	and that one can understand some of the things that happen there on the basis of Twister theory,
3018240	3022960	whether we can get, we're now understood, we've understood quite a bit about how rotational
3022960	3028720	invariance works, how angular momentum works, but it's kind of a weird business because in a
3028720	3035280	sense, we're trying to build from the machine code up. We can have a detailed mathematical
3035280	3040560	physics conversation. That's what most people are interested in. Oh, I disagree. I think that
3040560	3046640	people actually want to see whether or not, you know, both of us are saying outlandish things.
3046640	3051840	By the way, I don't think what I was saying was silly at all. It started mathematical physics.
3051840	3056000	I think it's all started mathematical physics. I'm going to invoke my referee. I'm going to
3056000	3060320	hold on. Hold on one second. I do want to point something out. I think it's very important. I've
3060320	3064960	heard this from people that I hold in high esteem, Paul Steinhart. One reason that Paul
3064960	3072080	says he refuses to ever get a Facebook or Twitter account is because he would invariably be tempted
3072080	3078240	to propose an interesting idea, which by necessity would be new, novel, untested, unproven at some
3078240	3085200	level. And then immediately it would be attacked, assailed, subjugated to constraints and concerns.
3085200	3090960	And I think you guys have both seen that for the following reason, that you both are master
3090960	3096960	explicators of what you do. You both are obviously domain experts in what you know and you understand
3096960	3101760	the other branches of physics and mathematics that are pertinent to it. However, neither one
3101760	3107920	really knows the intimacy of the other one's theories. And I think it's important to realize
3107920	3114240	that just like people assailing your theories from without, I think it's too soon to tell,
3114240	3119600	at least in the case of Stephen's work, which is, you know, in some sense, 20 years old or
3119600	3124640	coming up on 20 years old. And in some sense, it's also brand new, because I think when you look
3124640	3128320	at the successful applications, I feel like we should just check those off, Stephen. I mean,
3128320	3133920	biological systems, crystallography, you go down the list, finance, economics, where the
3133920	3141200	Wolfram approach, the new kind of science approach first outlined in 2003 or so, that has already
3141200	3145200	been proven. It doesn't need to be proven. Where I think it's different is where we lay on this extra
3145200	3151120	layer of computability as a fundamental nature of the universe, which for my perception, maybe
3151120	3156480	Stephen, correct me if I'm wrong, has sort of a multiverse component to it. You talk about
3156480	3162320	different aspects of the universe. Well, you talk in an essay that you wrote in 2017 about,
3162320	3166960	you know, the space of all universes where these rules... That was before I understood what I now
3166960	3172320	understand. Yeah. So, but we are barely coming up to where you were in 2017. So, can we take a step
3172320	3178640	back? We talked about the paradigm issue. I want to talk a little bit more about how these ideas get
3178640	3183520	into the firmament or get into the zeitgeist. Yeah, before you do that, I want to just clear
3183520	3192560	something up. Stephen, I'm not trying to scuttle your theory. I believe that your theory, if you
3192560	3199200	have an approach that works and it's a face up the same mountain, my belief is that you will get
3199200	3203360	to answer these questions. You may tell us for the first time, spiritually, what a spinner is
3204000	3209840	from a computational perspective. I'm not saying you've only done the easy stuff and the other
3209840	3214560	stuff is really hard. The stuff that you're talking about is really hard. What's going to pick out
3214560	3219760	the Riemann curvature tensor? How are you going to generate this? Great. That one's fairly easy.
3219760	3224000	Well, I believe that because it's very natural. There's a reason that in some sense it came first
3224960	3230640	before the Wu Yang dictionary. I think spinners are going to come out as the latest thing,
3230640	3235440	which is only a week old. So it's still uncooked. So we're tricking him to sharing this on the
3235440	3240560	live stream. It's exclusive. This is very good here. Well, we probably talked about it on how
3240560	3246320	working session live streams. But first point is in our models, quantum mechanics is a very natural
3246320	3252880	thing. When we think about traditional classical mechanics, it's like you throw a ball, it goes
3252880	3260160	in a definite direction. In quantum mechanics, the idea is that the ball tests out all possible
3260160	3265760	paths and then we only get to see various probabilities about what happens. In our models,
3265760	3270880	there are these things called multi-way systems, which basically are enumerating all the possible
3270880	3277840	paths. And the whole dynamics of how quantum mechanics works comes out of these multi-way
3277840	3284240	systems. Now, what happens is when you look at one of these multi-way systems at a particular time,
3284240	3287600	you take a slice through it and you get this thing we call branch shield space.
3288240	3294400	Branch shield space is the analog in the space of quantum states to physical space in kind of
3294400	3300080	ordinary position in the universe. By physical space, you mean a space like hyperspace?
3300080	3305200	These branch shield surfaces are the analog that branch like hypersurfaces, which are the analog
3305200	3311360	of space like hypersurfaces in standard spacetime. So this branch like hypersurface in branch
3311360	3316560	shield space, there's an extent in branch shield space, which is where as you move through branch
3316560	3321440	shield space, you're moving through the space of quantum entanglements. And so states that are
3321440	3325840	further away in branch shield space are less quantum entangled than states which are close
3325840	3330160	in branch shield space. What is your notion of a distance? Well, it's based on, if you look at
3330160	3336240	the multi-way graph, the nearest neighbors in branch shield space are things which have a common
3336240	3342480	ancestor one step back in the multi-way graph. So those are what we call branch pairs. I mean,
3342480	3346320	this is, unfortunately, it gets fairly... I appreciate that, but the idea is you have some
3346320	3352400	ordering by number of steps. Metric, yes. Metric like. It's based on sort of common ancestry in
3352400	3359200	the multi-way graph. And essentially what happens is, well, that thing on the left is a multi-way
3359200	3364720	causal graph. The thing on the right is a kind of play version of a kind of mixture of branch
3364720	3370240	shield space and physical space. Probably not the best visualization, but it's something. But
3370240	3375920	anyway, so the idea is there's physical space that we're all familiar with. There's this branch
3375920	3381120	shield space, which is the kind of space of quantum states, just like there's a speed of light
3381680	3385920	in physical space. In our model, there's a maximum entanglement speed in branch shield
3385920	3391040	space, which is kind of the maximum speed at which kind of you can... maximum speed of kind
3391040	3397360	of entanglement in that space. So, okay. Why is any of this relevant? Again, this is... I'm
3398720	3403920	in the Einstein equations, which have to do with physical space. One is looking at,
3403920	3408560	in the one way to view the Einstein equations, is to think about what happens to a GDC, what
3408560	3413360	happens to the path of a particle in spacetime. Essentially, what's happening in the Einstein
3413360	3423440	equations is that energy momentum causes deflections in GD6 in spacetime. In a branch
3423440	3430160	shield space, the exact same thing happens. Essentially, energy momentum causes deflections
3430160	3437040	in GD6 in branch shield space. And it turns out that that deflection process gives one the Feynman
3437040	3442560	path integral, which is really cool. And it's one of the things that I sort of found the most
3442560	3448640	elegant in the things that we've done so far in this theory, that what in physical space is
3448640	3453920	the Einstein equations in branch shield space is the path integral. Okay. Why is this relevant to
3453920	3459280	fermions and bosons? The reason it's relevant is that... Wait, wait. I just want to take a moment
3459280	3465360	to think about what you just said. You said that something in general relativity, that is Einstein's
3465360	3473840	equations, which are maximally resistant of all of our structures to quantization, is analogous,
3473840	3479680	in some ways, to the Feynman path integral, which I'm going to disagree later with your
3479680	3484160	characterization, which is Feynman's sort of characterization, the linguistic description
3484160	3489520	of what we claim is happening when we're taking one of these integrals. But the point is, is that
3489520	3495600	you're just making a claim on Poisson, which is astounding to begin with, if true. Which is that
3495600	3504000	the Einstein equations are somehow intimately bound up in the quintessential centerpiece of
3504960	3511280	quantum field theory, not even quantum mechanics. The Einstein equations... I mean,
3511280	3518720	this is a remarkable thing, which I certainly did not see coming, that the path integral is the exact
3518720	3522640	same thing as the Einstein equations, but in a different kind of space. Never heard this. Right.
3522640	3526880	So that's one of the things that we discovered like, I don't know, six, seven months ago,
3526880	3532160	that was like, wow. And those two things meet up when you think about black holes and black hole
3532160	3536560	information and so on. There's sort of this... And in fact, the ADS-CFT correspondence is almost
3536560	3543040	certainly taking this multi-way causal graph and projecting it into spacetime and projecting it
3543040	3548080	into branchial space. That it's the same graph projected in two different ways, corresponds
3548160	3553600	to the kind of general relativity ADS side of ADS-CFT and the quantum field theory CFT side of
3553600	3558320	it. That's almost certainly what that is. And various people are working on filling in the
3558320	3563760	details of that. It's pretty neat. So then, okay, you asked about fermions and bosons,
3563760	3568800	and I was going to tell you this week's kind of way of getting to that. And these are complicated
3568800	3574960	things. So it takes a few steps. Okay. So the next thing to realize is in quantum mechanics,
3574960	3580560	one of the things that emerged particularly from von Neumann's work was this idea of, there is an
3580560	3586800	amplitude. It is a complex number. It operates in Hilbert space, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
3586800	3590880	One of the things that was implicitly done was something which I think turns out to be a mistake,
3591440	3598720	which is that the magnitude and the phase of these quantum amplitudes were sort of all packaged
3598720	3604000	together. You mean the projectivization of a Hilbert space? Yes. Yes. Well, the fact that
3604080	3609200	the fact that you can think about it as a magnitude and phase is just a complex number.
3610160	3617360	In our models, what ends up happening is the magnitude and the phase come from completely
3617360	3622400	different places. And so what happens is the magnitude has to do with accounting of paths
3622400	3626800	going through this multigraph. The phase has to do with essentially where you land up in
3626800	3632800	branchial space. And actually, one of the things that we figured out about a week or two ago is
3632800	3638560	it's just unbelievably easy to get the double slit experiment to work. And we get nice pictures.
3638560	3641200	Yeah, I don't know what that means. But the first point, if I understand...
3641200	3642800	Oh, no, it's interference in quantum mechanics.
3642800	3643040	Right?
3643040	3643760	I understand that.
3645200	3649120	You mean you don't understand how it's easy. It comes out naturally in some sense.
3649120	3653840	No. What he's saying, I mean, we have to go back and unpack what the good doctor is saying.
3653840	3659040	He is talking about the fact that we claim that we work in a Hilbert space. We don't work in a
3659040	3663600	Hilbert space. We work in something called the projectivization of a Hilbert space.
3663600	3669120	And effectively, that destroys a certain amount of structure. So we begin with something like a
3669120	3674080	vector space. We remove the origin. We pluck it out like the seed out of a cherry. And then we take,
3674080	3678720	you know, all of the sort of meat and we compress it in this particular way. And what Stephen is
3678720	3684400	saying is that that is a loss of information that we teach physicists with their mother's milk,
3684400	3689200	and that this may be, in fact, throwing away information that is actually experimentally
3690080	3690800	much more important.
3690800	3696160	Well, I mean, I think that let's not go off into projective Hilbert space for a minute.
3699920	3701040	You guys never take me anywhere.
3702640	3704640	Buy me to the Hilbert space.
3705200	3712640	All right. The thing that ends up being interesting is the when you think about kind of these,
3713360	3721200	these, again, this is the kind of the sort of quantum gd6. What ends up happening is the phase
3721200	3726000	of the quantum amplitude is essentially defined by its position in Braunschild space. So you think
3726000	3731360	about these in general relativity, you'd think about, you know, a gd6 is deflected by the presence
3731360	3737200	of mass, you know, it's attracted to some massive object, moves around it, it changes the direction
3737200	3744960	of the gd6 has changed by the presence of mass. Okay. In in Braunschild space, it's the same story.
3744960	3750160	The the the gd6 is deflected by the presence of energy momentum. That presence of energy
3750160	3755360	momentum corresponds to Lagrangian and quantum field theory. And what one is doing is deflecting
3755360	3760880	that gd6, the deflection of the gd6. The interpretation of that is it's changing the
3760880	3765760	phase of the quantum amplitude. It's changing where that gd6 is going to land in Braunschild
3765760	3770400	space, which changes the phase of the quantum amplitude. And amusingly enough, what appears in
3770400	3776640	the Feynman-Path integral is exactly e to the i over h bar times the action integral. The action
3776640	3782080	integral is the integral in our world of the divergence of causal edges, which corresponds
3782080	3786880	to Lagrangian. There seem to be multiple things going on here. If I can just I do want to invoke
3786880	3793280	my my privilege here being being the moderator. We've covered the first of our six or seven topics
3793280	3798000	in 40 and an hour and 15 minutes. It's clear to me. I just want to finish on bosons for a second.
3798000	3802720	Okay, please. Yeah, please finish up. Let's move to our next, which will be experimental testability.
3802720	3810480	The flavor of of this is that what ends up happening with bosons is this kind of collection
3810480	3815760	in Braunschild space, this this kind of focusing in Braunschild space. And what seems to happen
3815760	3820560	with fermions is a divergence in Braunschild space. And it's, you know, one of the things that
3820560	3825280	I've been always been curious about is why are there only fermions and bosons? Why isn't there
3825280	3830480	lots of, you know, intermediate para statistics and so on. And I think that the answer is that
3830480	3835840	it's going to end up being the case that basically in Braunschild space, things either diverge or
3835840	3840800	they don't diverge. And that's going to but you know, there's there's much mathematical physics
3840880	3845760	packing that has to go around this. And if I could just take 15 seconds to riff off this.
3845760	3850640	Okay, you have a situation in which the great thing about general relativity, for example,
3850640	3856400	is that all you need is length and angle. And length and angle turns out to amount to a derivative
3856400	3860800	operator, which turns out to have mixed partials that don't commute, you can measure their failure,
3860800	3865600	that's the curvature, you knock it down with linear algebra, and you create grab. It's a miracle.
3865600	3870720	It's fantastic. On the other hand, it's not that surprising that if you have a situation in which
3870720	3878560	you have some notion of like size and perpendicularity, that you can create something like that. For
3878560	3882720	example, you do have something called malinobus distance that you can get out of data, you can
3882720	3889280	treat a covariance matrix like a Ramanian metric, if you will. So there are all sorts of ways in
3889280	3894640	which we already know that they're that the discrete that anything that leads to length and
3894640	3901120	angle becomes geometric. And I think that, you know, that's both very good for Dr. Wolfram,
3901120	3907120	and it is also just a bit of caution for the rest of us that on the the early part may lead you on
3907120	3912560	because it's a different way of describing length and angle and the consequences, which
3912560	3918800	thanks to both Einstein and Grossman and I guess, Hilbert, we know that all we're looking for in some
3918800	3924480	sense is the most basic consequence of that. It'll be cool to see it come out. And I do
3924480	3929680	believe that you you may likely get fermions out of a question. You may have to ask the question
3929680	3933440	about how to take the square root of something. I'll be astounded if you have fermions without
3933440	3941040	taking a square root. But the key feature, you know, is that you're not that far away from geometry
3941040	3944800	as soon as you're talking about malinobus distance and covariance matrix and data.
3944800	3950640	Okay, so, you know, the one cool thing is that the uncertainty principle in our theory is basically
3950640	3957040	the analog of Riemann curvature in branchial space. So the the non commuting of variables
3957040	3962320	is just like a non commuting. And in geometric quantization, it is literally the curvature
3962320	3968160	tensor on in the Hamiltonian picture. Absolutely. So by the way, in terms of the square root thing,
3968160	3974320	I have the following guess, okay, that what basically happens in branchial spaces, you have
3974320	3980480	these branch pairs, and they converge. Okay, branch pairs. Next step, they converge. I think
3980480	3986160	that the boson cases, they diverge and they converge. The fermion cases, they diverge and
3986160	3991680	they don't converge. And so in some sense, the square root is being taken by the fact that you
3991680	3996080	are having the the beginning of that diamond, but not the end of the diamond. Sounds like the
3996080	4001360	difference between commutators and anticommutators. Yeah, yeah, it's the it's the it's my my first
4001360	4007200	guess about how that works. And it'll it's I mean, the thing that again, I thought we were going to
4007200	4012480	have to, you know, find actual electrons to be able to distinguish fermions and bosons,
4012480	4018240	it's seeming increasingly likely that we can basically understand fermions in bulk without
4018240	4023760	having to know exactly how particles work. What I want to do now is sort of compare and contrast
4023760	4028960	different approaches, not necessarily only from the two of you. But in the in the context that I
4028960	4033600	often get, well, first of all, the common thing that I get from all my, you know, friends on Reddit
4033600	4038160	or wherever else this gets posted is, you know, how come these things aren't being peer reviewed
4038160	4043360	and what kinds of falsifiable predictions are they making? Let's start with the latter. Steven,
4043360	4048240	you and I talked back in April, and you made it clear that things such as the fundamental
4048240	4054400	constants of nature, the speed of light are emergent or embedded encoded encrypted within
4054960	4060640	within your new findings. I want to know, are there new predictions that could be used instead
4060640	4065040	of retradictions? Not that they don't have validity, not that they don't have a value.
4065040	4070320	After all, Einstein, you know, in some sense validated his his theory on a retradiction,
4070320	4073680	which was known for a million, you know, millions of years. It was known for years,
4073680	4078960	the perihelion advance of the planet Mercury, and it had to be reconciled with with Einstein's
4079600	4083600	predictions. And through observations, it was found to be true. I want to know,
4083600	4090400	Steven, are there new fundamental predictions that you can can point to that have at least,
4090400	4094720	in principle, a chance of being detected? And then I'll have a similar question for Eric.
4094720	4102000	Well, let's see, I don't do the the dueling theories theory, but but yeah, falsifiability is a
4102000	4108640	weird concept that has all kinds of problems. But the fact is, you know, first thing is,
4109200	4113040	the number one thing that we're building is a framework, like calculus.
4114320	4119680	Calculus is not something that's falsifiable. Calculus is a framework for doing things.
4120400	4127920	Second question is, does calculus usefully apply to the universe? That's something we can
4127920	4133360	validly ask. And that's something that, you know, we can, there are things which are sort of generic
4133360	4139440	predictions from the framework. So the thing we're trying to do right now is what people
4140000	4144640	should do when they first introduce some, you know, new set of ideas, which is,
4144640	4148720	can we actually reproduce? Can we make theoretical predictions? Can we reproduce what
4148720	4154880	what what has been known before? And can we get out vastly more than we put in? Yes, we put very
4154880	4159840	little in. And the question is, do we get all these things out? Or do we have to add some special
4159840	4165680	clues to get fermions? Or do fermions come out naturally, as soon as we understand how to get
4165680	4170480	there? And the thing which has been remarkable so far is, you know, we've been checking off,
4170480	4177840	do we get this, do we get that, do we get that? So far, touch wood, no clues. I mean, so far,
4177840	4183120	it's been hard work. But nothing has been like, Oh, my gosh, the universe, you know,
4183120	4187440	the theory predicts the universe should be 26 dimensional, we have to explain why it's not
4187520	4192320	type thing. We haven't had any of those kind of, you know, clues barriers, so to speak.
4192320	4197120	So that's encouraging. Now, in terms of actually making specific, measurable predictions,
4197920	4203680	a couple of issues. First issue is going from the raw theory, the low level machine code,
4203680	4207840	to something where you turn a telescope in that direction, and you see a particular thing.
4207840	4212640	There's lots of, you know, there's lots of hard work and lots of astrophysics and so on to be done
4212640	4219360	in going from one place to another. That's first point. The second point is that to actually make
4220080	4225360	one of the things in our theory is there is one scale. Same happened with Einstein's theory,
4225360	4229920	actually. Although, for various reasons that, well, we can talk about that, but there's one scale,
4229920	4235520	which is this maximum entanglement speed. We don't know what the value of that is. We have
4235520	4240720	some guesses, but we don't know its value. If we knew its value, we would have a whole bunch of
4240720	4246080	predictions immediately. But we don't know its value. Einstein had the same problem. He had the
4246080	4250960	cosmological constant. He didn't know its value. It's, you know, a lot of predictions he might
4250960	4254560	have liked to make. He couldn't make because he didn't know the value of the cosmological constant.
4255120	4259360	You know, he had one meta prediction was that the universe wasn't expanding, he thought,
4259360	4264160	which is why he added his cosmological constant in the first place. But that's his scale. So then
4264160	4268800	he had a few scale independent predictions, in particular, the, you know, the bending of light
4268880	4272640	around the sun being a factor of two larger than I've been predicting the previous theory,
4272640	4277360	things like that. So one thing that we've been interested in is what scale independent predictions
4277360	4282800	can we make? That's question one. And question two, what predictions can we make that are,
4283440	4289200	as soon as we know this one scale, we immediately have predictions. And then which predictions can
4289200	4294240	we make that have the shortest distance in terms of the tower of astrophysics or particle physics
4294240	4298480	or whatever they have to be done. It's a cautionary tale that like Newton, for example, you know,
4298480	4303200	he goes through his whole, you know, Principia, and he works out lots of things about his law of
4303200	4308000	gravity. And he has a section about the moon. And the section about the moon ends with the
4308000	4312400	sentence, I think, but the abs of the moon is twice as great. In other words, he got the wrong
4312400	4317280	answer. And, you know, one might have said, Oh, my gosh, he got the wrong answer, he better abandon
4317280	4322000	the whole theory and run away, so to speak. Turns out it was just hard to do those calculations. It
4322000	4327120	took another 150 years to get them nailed down. So that wasn't, you know, so one has to be a little
4327280	4331440	bit an Einstein also, you know, the first time he computed the bending of light around the sun,
4331440	4336880	he got it wrong. And it was, you know, fortunate, the first, you know, experiment that was going
4336880	4342320	to be done on that didn't end up getting done because of World War One. And so, you know,
4342320	4346080	by the time an experiment did get done, he'd managed to get the right answer, whether the
4346080	4350080	experiment was right, it's a different story. But that's, that's another, another thing. But I
4350080	4355760	think that the so the question of, you know, do we have kind of scale independent predictions?
4355760	4361280	The answer is quite possibly. I think there's one quite likely one that has to do with
4361280	4366000	two photon correlations for photons in orbit around rotating black holes,
4366640	4370000	is a slightly obscure thing, but it's not completely out of the range of what's
4370000	4375120	experimentally accessible. Other, I mean, it's kind of amusing that that's so bizarrely similar,
4375120	4380640	it's a kind of a quantum analog of Einstein's, you know, bending of light around the sun type thing.
4381440	4387600	But, you know, that's one kind of thing. Another thing is a suggestion, at least from the theory,
4387600	4392480	about the existence of particles much lighter than the electron, maybe 10 to the 20th times
4392480	4396960	lighter than the electron. That number depends on the scale parameter that we don't know.
4396960	4400400	The existence of such particles probably has a bunch of implications for dark matter,
4401360	4407600	which are things that we're planning to work out. There are a bunch of implications for cosmology.
4407600	4413040	I mean, there's an expectation, not a necessary feature, but a suggestion, at least from the model,
4413040	4417520	that the universe starts kind of infinite dimensional and only gradually kind of
4417520	4422720	decay down to the sort of modest three dimensions that we have now. That has a bunch of implications
4422720	4427200	for inflationary scenarios for the universe and so on. You know, I think the most outlandish
4427200	4432320	possibility, which I don't think will actually happen, is that still at the time of recombination,
4432320	4438400	you know, when your cosmic microwave background globe was minted, so to speak, that there would
4438400	4444000	still be a trace of some of the early discrete processes that happened in the very early stages
4444000	4447840	of the universe. I really doubt that it would have survived that long. But if it did, the absolutely
4447840	4452480	outlandish possibility is that the kind of the rule for the universe might be painted in the
4452480	4456960	microwave background radiation, which would be truly wrong. I don't think that would happen.
4457600	4461600	I think it's very unlikely. But, you know, early density perturbations, there might be some things
4461600	4468880	that would be a result of this changing dimensional scenario that's rather different from the traditional
4468880	4474400	exponential expansion and four dimensional space, space time of inflationary cosmology.
4474400	4479440	That's on the one side. On the particle physics side, and well, one of the things is that it's
4479440	4486080	looking very much as if quantum computing at some fundamental level can't work. However,
4486640	4492080	seeing that and seeing the actual effects of our theory for decoherence and things like that,
4492080	4498400	it's not at all clear that the can't work point is something experimentally accessible.
4498400	4505120	And I think that the, you know, it's a question. There's some clever experiment that can be done
4505680	4511600	in quantum computing that could see this maximum entanglement speed. That's basically the,
4511600	4515280	and we don't know what the value of that speed is, so we can't really tell. What estimate that we
4515280	4519680	have of that speed is 10 to the five solar masses per second. If that estimate is correct,
4520240	4525120	then it is possible that in black hole, well, it's possible that we'll make small
4525120	4531440	effect in a black hole merger of, you know, one and a half solar mass type size would have a bigger
4531440	4538480	effect if, you know, two sort of central black holes of two galaxies happen to collide and merge,
4538480	4542720	then there will be a bigger effect. It's also conceivable that there might be an effect when
4542720	4548320	black holes initially form. And this is an astrophysics question for you, Brian. How long does
4548320	4554160	it take a black hole to actually form? Once you have in falling matter, the question is what the
4554160	4560160	actual weather in 10 to the minus five seconds, something, whether one can tell what's happening
4560160	4564640	in the last 10 to the minus five seconds of the formation of a black hole. If one can,
4564640	4568400	and if our estimate of the maximum entanglement speed is right, then there will probably be
4568400	4571040	differences from the predictions of general relativity for that case.
4571040	4577520	This is a big question, primordial black hole formation, the end of inflation. These are really
4577520	4581360	important questions that, you know, it's good to it's good to hear, especially that you're,
4581360	4584160	you know, providing potential full employment for my graduate students.
4585200	4589200	Yes, there will be lots of work to do in figuring out the consequences of these things. I mean,
4589200	4593760	it's a particularly when we get this kind of way of actually doing computations in general
4593760	4598240	relativity from our model, set up as a piece of practical numerical relativity, and that that
4598240	4602320	will probably happen fairly quickly. We'll actually be able to see a bunch of these effects
4602320	4607120	directly in the computations that we do, but there'll be, you know, just layers of astrophysics
4607120	4615520	to do. And Eric, I want you to sort of opine on this provocative question that I'm being asked
4615520	4622560	in the chat room. And that is, you know, what of what value is a theory if it is not to be
4622560	4626160	testable, you know, that which can be claimed without evidence can be dismissed without
4626240	4630880	evidence as our friend Christopher Hitchens used to say, I believe. So in the context of
4630880	4635840	geometric unity, I'm not asking you to talk about somebody else's book, but talk, talk your own
4635840	4642000	book for a second. Are there things that are testable by graduate students in my group or other
4642000	4646880	brilliant students around the world? Are there predictions? Are there retradictions that are
4646880	4653120	crisp enough to, to satisfy Popper A? And do you think we should continue to feed Popper as he had
4653120	4660240	enough Pop Pop Pop Popper corn? The first point would be there's a missing layer between you and
4660240	4668080	myself. What we do typically Stephen notwithstanding is is that we come up with a classical model
4668080	4672800	in the form of some sort of geometry. Hopefully it quantizes itself or something like
4672800	4679440	geometric quantization. And then we try to figure out what the testable consequences are in any
4679440	4685960	given energy level through a bunch of phenomenologists, experimentalists, and pure quantum field theorists
4685960	4690080	working hand-in-hand in our harmonious fashion, at least that's the theory.
4690080	4694160	Given that we have a missing layer, there's tons I can say about what's new, what's different,
4694160	4697920	and what my theory says, and effectively what would make it wrong.
4697920	4703480	So I'm happy to get into that because it effectively says that a lot of our standard
4703480	4707800	verbiage around what we've found is in fact wrong.
4707800	4712520	So for example, standard thing is the world is chiral, the weak force sees the difference
4712520	4716000	between our left hand and our right hand, spiritually speaking.
4716000	4720480	My claim is that the world is not fundamentally chiral, it is emergently chiral, and that
4720480	4725720	in fact it begins in a non-chiral fashion which solves the problem that Sabina does
4725720	4730520	not see, which is what chooses whether it's going to be the left half or the right half
4730520	4734200	effectively that makes up us in some sense.
4734280	4740040	Can we already know from neutrino masses that we're not seeing a completely chiral situation?
4740040	4744640	We can get into the issue of how to interpret neutrino masses.
4744640	4748640	My claim would be that we have entire sectors that we're not seeing.
4748640	4755960	So for example, unadorned spin one-half bundles that would be tensored with, if you will,
4755960	4762240	the conjugate of the 16-dimensional representation which imparts the particles, their personalities.
4762280	4766360	So that is not something that's seen, and I've analogized it, for those of you watching
4766360	4771680	at home rather than listening, where you have a hand and you see with three fingers in the
4771680	4775880	middle that you think there's a symmetry in the hand, and then you have this problem about
4775880	4779800	how do I make my pinky look like my thumb, and you don't realize that there's an entire
4779800	4784720	other hand and that it's thumb-to-thumb, and pinky-to-pinky, not pinky-to-thumb, it's the
4784720	4786720	symmetry.
4786720	4791280	There is a non-chiral world that is emergently chiral, which is fooling us into thinking it's
4791320	4792320	fundamentally chiral.
4792320	4795480	There are only two generations, not three generations.
4795480	4798920	People will immediately say, well, how do you explain the fact that we've seen the tau
4798920	4804600	particle in the top and bottom works, and the claim is that is not a generation because
4804600	4811120	it will not unify as you heat the soup up in the same way as the first two generations
4811120	4812120	will unify.
4812120	4817280	In fact, it will unify with another collection of particles, also spin one-half, which I
4817360	4822000	believe, if I recall correctly, the thing that will be misinterpreted as an internal
4822000	4826360	representation, I think will be like 112 dimensional rather than 16.
4826360	4828760	There will be no internal representations.
4828760	4831240	There will be no internal symmetries.
4831240	4835280	This has been a huge trip up for things like supersymmetry, where we keep looking for these
4835280	4842280	super partners, which I've analogized a little bit to what happens if you're convinced that
4842280	4849280	Spiderman should be, in fact, Clark Kent, should be accompanied by Clark Kent, and Peter Parker
4849880	4852200	should be accompanied by Superman.
4852200	4853280	We have this wrong.
4853280	4857000	There is no internal symmetry, nor should you expect internal symmetry, because this comes
4857000	4863720	out of two fundamental origin stories, one for the spacetime manifold, another for effectively
4863720	4868960	the y-axis above that as the x-axis.
4869000	4873440	We decide that somehow we have spacetime and Einstein, and then somehow we get this thing
4873440	4879280	called SU3 cross SU2 cross U1 that falls out of the sky, which is a second origin story.
4879280	4880640	There is not two origin stories.
4880640	4881640	There is one.
4881640	4885320	Einstein, I believe, one of the problems, Stephen, I'm going to say, is that we have
4885320	4891160	been in a very difficult position relative to Einstein, because unlike anyone else, because
4891160	4897120	of the thought experiments, we have a reverence for not only what he gave us in terms of equations,
4897160	4901920	but also how he thought the beautiful humanity that he imparted to everyone, so we don't
4901920	4903520	want to harm him in any way.
4903520	4908720	It's also the fact that he was wrong, and he was wrong in an interesting way, in the
4908720	4912920	same way I believe that Newton was wrong, and we souped up Newton with Einstein, but
4912920	4917320	that physics is taking place, in my opinion, on two separate spaces.
4917320	4923320	You can call x and y, or Brian, I've joked with you, calling it Harris and Hushamai,
4923840	4926040	the heaven and the earth.
4926040	4931360	In these two spaces, there is a map between, and that is the map that, in fact, Einstein
4931360	4935600	started playing with, but he did not think to pull back the information from space two
4935600	4938880	onto space one, from space x to space y.
4938880	4944040	I believe that there is a deformation complex, which in the Euclidean signature is elliptic,
4944040	4949080	which in fact tells us why the self-dual equations and the Tren Simons-Gabe's theory that were
4949080	4952960	studied in the late 70s, early 80s, are so important.
4952960	4958240	In fact, it was a special example of a much more general structure, comes out of geometric
4958240	4959240	unity.
4959240	4962680	That there is not two kinds of geometry in this situation.
4962680	4968640	One Riemannian geometry underlying general relativity, an Erismanian geometry of fiber
4968640	4970960	bundles underlying the standard model.
4970960	4974920	There is, in fact, one geometry, and that one geometry is why it's called geometric
4974920	4980360	unity, and it has to do with the difficulty of a lie that we tell in general relativity,
4980360	4984720	which is that we say that it is a so-called gauge theory, where we try to get the gauge
4984720	4989560	group to be something called the diffeomorphism group, or general coordinate variance.
4989560	4994000	We allow it to act on the space of metrics, whereas in the case of the standard model,
4994000	4999720	we have a space, not of metrics, but of derivative operators from calculus called connections,
4999720	5002040	and the group we have is the gauge group.
5002040	5006400	The gauge group is an infinite dimensional beast that acts on the space of connection.
5006400	5011920	We do not understand, in fact, that telling this lie to make general relativity look like
5011920	5016520	a gauge theory, in fact, block progress, and that we should treat it as an honest gauge
5016520	5017520	theory.
5017520	5021360	We are going to have to recognize that the cosmological constant is not constant.
5021360	5028040	It is a field which acquires a BEV, or a vacuum expectation value, as it is lured away by topological
5028040	5029040	mechanisms.
5029040	5032000	We are going to see that we got the Lorentz group wrong.
5032000	5035640	We focused on the Lorentz group when we meant to be focusing on the gauge group.
5035640	5039680	We formed its inhomogeneous extension called the Poincare group.
5039680	5045760	In fact, you're supposed to extend it by something called ad-valued one-forms to create, effectively,
5045760	5048120	the inhomogeneous gauge group.
5048120	5052400	That is the object on which you're supposed to do supersymmetric analysis.
5052400	5054960	Our concept of supersymmetry is wrong.
5054960	5057880	In effect, we're acting on the wrong group.
5057880	5062800	We've chosen Minkowski space as the naturally occurring affine space that is not the right
5062800	5063800	place to be playing.
5063800	5066760	The right place to be playing is the space of connection.
5066760	5072400	There's a huge number of things I can tell you about the missing matter.
5072400	5080760	What in our sector, its SU3 cross SU2 cross U1 internal quantum numbers will be 16 new
5080760	5086240	particles that are spin 3 halves with conjugate internal quantum numbers.
5086240	5092360	The same thing as our usual 16 dimensional representation, but the complex conjugate thereof,
5092360	5099360	which we have not seen yet, and explaining why the illusion of three generations is generated
5099360	5105840	by what would be called branching rules with respect to Lie algebra and Lie group representation
5105840	5106840	decomposition.
5106840	5109680	Yes, I can tell you a bunch of new particles.
5109680	5114960	I can tell you about non-kirality, the number of generations, how Einstein is wrong, what
5115000	5119520	spaces we're supposed to be doing this on, and then there's a question about, okay, well,
5119520	5121520	what can you tell us about the accelerators?
5121520	5125400	By the way, this is all subject to, if my theory is correct, but it gets boring to say
5125400	5128040	if my theory is correct over and over again.
5128040	5132880	There should just be a general caveat that all of this assumes geometric unity is in fact
5132880	5133880	correct.
5133880	5139800	Yes, there's a ton of specificity, and Brian, I'm looking forward to coming down to UCSD
5139800	5140800	and actually doing it.
5140800	5141800	Let me just say something.
5141920	5147480	I've been very pissed off about this claim that what I'm talking about, different from
5147480	5153120	what Dr. Wolfram is talking about, is so impenetrable and difficult.
5153120	5159640	It really has to do with the sickness in our field that our field just isn't interested
5159640	5162040	in some sense because it doesn't believe.
5162040	5167280	We all know that the problems have gotten so difficult and so hard, and so many smart
5167280	5172720	people have been over them, that a sense of learned helplessness has invaded the field,
5172720	5174160	which we have to talk about.
5174160	5178920	People no longer feel like they're actual physicists that can connect to Schrodinger
5178920	5182800	or Heisenberg or Dirac or Einstein or Planck.
5182800	5188120	People don't even feel like Weinberg and Yang were still with us, or in some sense,
5188120	5192320	nobody's gone to, I see, losing the Nobel Prize at Brian's shoulder.
5192320	5199920	Nobody's gone to Stockholm for advances in fundamental physical theory, since the theories
5199920	5202520	put forward since the early 1970s.
5202520	5204120	I think that's a correct statement.
5204120	5211680	All the people who've contributed to the fundamental canon are either dead or septigenarians or
5211680	5213920	higher, I think.
5213920	5217680	Maybe Frank Wilczek was born in 1951, is at the end of the 60s.
5217680	5222800	We have to recognize that this sense that it is impossible has caused lots of us to
5222800	5227600	start faking it and to start calculating what we need to do for our careers rather than
5227600	5232640	how to actually advance the science, which is one reason that both Stephen and I are
5232640	5238720	viewed as incredibly brash, effectively too brusque, maybe too arrogant.
5238720	5243960	The answer, I believe, is that we have to drive this field out of its sense that it's
5243960	5246360	playing at physics rather than doing physics.
5246360	5248440	It's talking around physics.
5248440	5251760	One of the things I want to do on these live streams is I want to actually talk about the
5251760	5256520	meat of the theories and let people scurry to Wikipedia or help each other out to try
5256520	5260200	to understand what is said rather than make it an enjoyable product for everybody.
5260200	5261200	I agree.
5261200	5262200	I agree.
5262200	5265040	But Stephen has said earlier, this is simple.
5265040	5266040	It's not easy.
5266040	5268840	It's not trivial.
5268840	5273400	My nine-year-old, who you'll meet someday, hopefully both of you guys, he can play around
5273440	5274960	with rule 30.
5274960	5276240	He can get stimulated.
5276240	5278240	He can engage with it.
5278240	5284720	So when you say that it's not difficult, I don't agree that there's a character class
5284720	5288160	that differentiates, and I'm not pitting it one against another.
5288160	5292440	For certain, there are more complicated models than even Eric's, in my opinion.
5292440	5293440	Wait, wait.
5293440	5294440	How is my model complicated?
5294440	5295920	I'm just a simple experimentalist.
5295920	5302200	Fourteen-dimensional dual spaces, and look, if it's too complicated for Sabina to understand,
5302400	5303400	I think our general...
5303400	5304400	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
5304400	5307360	This is just unfair, and I want to be very clear about it.
5307360	5310520	If you talk about general relativity, which Stephen has been talking about throughout
5310520	5316120	our live stream, he's talking about the idea that you have a space, call it X, and it has
5316120	5317520	a metric on it.
5317520	5323120	And that metric is a map into the space of all possible metrics, call that Y.
5323120	5326520	That X and that Y are where geometric unity lives.
5326520	5330600	So with all due respect to Sabina and her, I can't understand anything.
5330600	5331800	It's also complicated.
5332400	5337640	You've got to map between the chronospacetime and the space of metrics.
5337640	5342920	That Romani metric is simply a map between two topological spaces.
5342920	5344400	It's not that complicated.
5344400	5345400	I don't...
5345400	5346400	Brian, it's just not true.
5346400	5347400	Okay.
5347400	5348400	Let's move on, actually.
5348400	5349400	I want to make a few comments about...
5349400	5350400	Okay, Stephen, go ahead.
5350400	5351800	So maybe people will find interesting.
5351800	5357360	I mean, so, you know, maps between topological spaces, diffeomorphisms, these kinds of ideas.
5357360	5361320	But, you know, I happened to learn these ideas when I was a kid.
5361320	5363160	Most people don't.
5363160	5364840	These are fairly...
5364840	5371680	Most people learn those ideas in, I don't know, mid-math college, if they go to a fancy
5371680	5374840	college, maybe math, graduate school, those kinds of things.
5374840	5377360	They happen to be fairly complicated.
5377360	5382560	There are fields of science where people can contribute without having gone to graduate
5382560	5383560	school.
5383560	5385600	There are other fields where they can't contribute very much.
5385600	5387800	We see that in people.
5387800	5393000	One of the great things about kind of some of these computational areas of science is
5393000	5398840	that because it's kind of, you know, because it's very new territory, it's possible for
5398840	5402280	people to contribute without having kind of gone to graduate school and learned a whole
5402280	5404360	big stack of concepts.
5404360	5409000	One of the things, you know, I get pretty much every day, you know, a theory of physics
5409000	5410000	from somebody.
5410000	5414800	Eric's version is, you know, he went to Harvard and got a PhD in mathematical physics.
5414800	5419440	So his version is much better dressed than most of the versions that I see.
5419440	5420440	Okay?
5420440	5425000	And most of the versions that I see are, you know, I find it disappointing because it feels
5425000	5429000	like people are, you know, writing poetry that nobody's going to read and they're doing
5429000	5432280	it using kind of high school level physics knowledge.
5432280	5433280	It's mostly cranks.
5433280	5436640	People who may be well-meaning, but they don't realize that they're way out of their
5436640	5437640	depth.
5437640	5438640	Yeah.
5438640	5439640	Right.
5439640	5442920	But the main thing is that they don't know what got done in the 20th century in physics.
5443040	5447920	What got done in the 20th century in physics requires kind of graduate school level knowledge
5447920	5449640	to understand.
5449640	5451840	And we can say it isn't true, but it is true.
5451840	5455920	I mean, it's, you know, general relativity and quantum field theory, you know, Eric
5455920	5457320	may say they're simple theories.
5457320	5461480	I think they're kind of simple theories, but that's because I learned about them when
5461480	5465840	I was, I don't know, 12, 13 years old and by now they seem like simple theories.
5465840	5469880	And if it's simple to you or if it's even marginally complex to Stephen, what, what
5469880	5470880	helped?
5470920	5476600	So just the whole language of talking about things, you know, this is kind of math, graduate
5476600	5478320	school type language.
5478320	5484480	And that's, now, is there a way to state these things about fiber bundles and so on without
5484480	5486200	sort of super fancy language?
5486200	5487760	Quite possibly.
5487760	5491240	Maybe some of the things we're trying to do will give away to do that.
5491240	5493960	And that's part of the hope of just bringing your communities together.
5493960	5496160	Let me move on just because we don't know much time.
5496160	5498080	You guys are very gracious with your time.
5498080	5499080	I want to respect it.
5499080	5500240	And I have kids to put to bed.
5500240	5504320	And I do want to ask the following question that my audience is asking when we think about
5504320	5506560	the power of these different approaches.
5506560	5508560	Let's take a step away from either one of yours.
5508560	5514480	There's been a lot made about artificial intelligence and the prospects for as Max Tegmark has put
5514480	5517760	it, you know, an artificial physicist and artificial Galileo.
5517760	5520960	What role do you guys see artificial intelligence playing?
5520960	5522320	And then you know where I'm going next.
5522320	5525920	I know that you guys know I'm going to the simulation hypothesis.
5525920	5529680	And I've talked to you guys individually, maybe offline about this, but the audience
5529680	5536560	is very keen to know your two esteemed gentlemen, what you think about the prospects for AI and
5536560	5538160	as a benefit to physics.
5538160	5540160	And then later we'll ask about the simulation hypothesis.
5540160	5541760	Let me start with Steven, please.
5541760	5546280	I mean, I've worked on what is now called AI for about 40 something years.
5546280	5548240	So I know a tiny bit about it.
5548240	5550280	A lot of, I don't know, I don't know where to start.
5550280	5554640	I mean, if you're talking about machine learning, if you're talking about, oh, let's sort of
5554640	5558600	throw everything we know about physics into a machine learning system and see whether it
5558640	5560240	can figure out the laws of physics.
5560240	5561160	That's one level.
5561160	5561960	Yeah, that's one level.
5561960	5566080	Noam Chomsky, who was on my show and said, you know, he has, he's sanguine about what
5566080	5571240	you just described, perhaps as his max tag mark, but the true creative stroke, he has
5571240	5576760	no, you know, the kind of it's a little bit complicated because in, you know, computational
5576760	5583760	irreducibility tells us that we can know the rules for something, but have no way to kind
5583760	5587240	of have a large scale narrative for how the thing happens.
5587240	5589960	So in other words, we might say, yes, we've succeeded.
5589960	5592240	We found rules that reproduce physics.
5592880	5594840	You say, well, tell me how they work.
5595160	5596360	You say, well, here are the rules.
5596640	5599000	But you say, well, tell me a story about how they work.
5599000	5601920	Tell me a high level, you know, version of how they work.
5602560	5603840	That may not be possible.
5603920	5609320	I mean, for example, in linguistics, picking on, on Noam Chomsky's area, you know, we may
5609320	5615080	have a description of how brains work and how brains process language at a sort of
5615600	5617600	microscopic computational level.
5618040	5620680	And we may still, and it may be completely accurate.
5621200	5625160	And we may still not have anything we would call a satisfactory science of linguistics.
5625960	5629080	So in other words, it's a, it's a slightly complicated thing.
5629080	5633640	And the question of whether, you know, whether we can get a current, you know, machine learning
5633640	5638840	system to reverse engineer the laws of physics, you know, to some extent, you can do that to
5638840	5642040	a fantastic extent of, of figuring out everything.
5642040	5642960	You won't be able to do that.
5642960	5648120	I don't think and, and, you know, the challenge, again, we keep on coming at things at really
5648120	5655160	weird angles, but there's a, you know, okay, the way I see it, there's kind of what's possible
5655280	5658200	in the computational universe, what simple programs can do.
5658480	5660920	There's this kind of ocean of computational possibility.
5661280	5663480	There's what we humans understand.
5664120	5666720	That's another kind of piece.
5667160	5669320	And there's also what the physical universe does.
5669840	5674080	And, you know, I've spent a large part of my life trying to bridge between the sort of
5674080	5678440	ocean of computational possibility and what we humans understand, that's the whole sort
5678440	5685120	of point of the computational language I've built is to have a way to have humans be able
5685120	5691200	to think about things computationally and be able to communicate what they want in a
5691200	5692400	computational fashion.
5692800	5695480	Now we have the sort of third piece of physics.
5695800	5701080	And the question is how we describe, you know, how we make this bridge between sort of the
5701080	5707280	physical universe, doing what it does, our ability to tell a narrative about what's going
5707280	5712680	on, and this kind of computation in the middle as this kind of mediator of those two things.
5712680	5715160	But I mean, this is, it's a mess.
5715160	5719560	I would say that there's a, there's a, I mean, this is a longer discussion.
5719560	5722440	And I think there's probably the wrong angle to come at it with.
5722640	5727520	If you say, are we going to have a, a, you know, a magic thing that we can throw stuff
5727520	5729680	into and get out the theory of physics?
5730120	5730960	Well, I doubt it.
5731280	5734000	You know, you talked about the simulation argument, I might, I always find it kind of
5734000	5737760	charming that people say, you know, I'm an atheist.
5738000	5739280	I believe in science.
5740040	5745480	You know, what I believe is that, you know, there's this, we're in this universe and this
5745480	5751600	universe is actually a simulation operated by operated by the universe.
5752800	5753840	But I'm an atheist.
5753840	5754480	Exactly.
5754480	5754800	Right.
5754800	5757400	And then all the morality that entails therein.
5757400	5757680	Yes.
5757680	5758040	Right.
5758040	5762520	But, but I think that the, more seriously, I think that that sort of argument is kind
5762520	5767840	of philosophically doomed because by the time you have definite laws for physics, there
5767840	5770560	isn't much for the God to do, so to speak.
5770680	5774640	Now, the only thing you might say is, but the God gets to pick the laws of physics,
5775240	5780680	except that we now seem to have found that it actually doesn't matter what the laws
5780680	5785720	of physics are, that in some sense, in this kind of, again, for reasons that again, this
5785720	5787160	is a slightly longer story.
5787160	5792920	But what matters is that we are observing physics in a certain way, and that's what
5792920	5795880	gives us the laws that we believe to be laws of physics.
5796200	5800120	And there really isn't, in a sense, there's nothing for the, for the God to do other
5800120	5806840	than to decide that our universe is going to be computational, not hyper computational,
5807160	5808960	not below computational.
5809080	5815920	And even if those other sort of kind of conceptual universes exist, we, you know,
5815920	5820600	again, it's a matter of science to be able to say that we simply can't communicate with them.
5820600	5825400	They're simply, they're just not things which are in any way connected to what we can perceive.
5825680	5830440	So I think it's a, it's a, I do like the idea, though, that there's a connection between sort
5830440	5833160	of AI physics and the simulation argument.
5833160	5837080	I think that's a, that's a, that's an interesting and bizarre connection, which,
5837080	5839240	which I think would be fun to unpack some more.
5839400	5842680	And Eric, you want to opine on this or would you, yeah, go ahead.
5843000	5849080	I don't really know whether it even requires AI and, or AGI.
5849480	5855000	There's a particular kind of move that we haven't programmed into computers yet,
5855000	5856040	so far as I'm aware.
5856040	5861240	Now, Stephen probably knows this much better than I do, but there's a weird move that comes
5861240	5867640	up over and over again, which has to do with reaching for something outside of your model
5867640	5869240	and knowing what to reach for.
5869240	5875320	So for example, you have a problem with the weak interactions that a new neutron when it decays
5875320	5881320	into a proton and an electron called beta decay doesn't seem to have enough energy in the final
5881320	5885080	products to conserve energy from the initial products.
5885080	5887000	So Pauli had to.
5887000	5887480	Oh yeah.
5887480	5888040	Okay.
5888040	5889720	You're explaining how new tree knows come to be.
5889720	5889880	Yeah.
5889880	5890120	Okay.
5890120	5890440	Fine.
5890440	5890680	Yes.
5890680	5891000	Right.
5891000	5893320	Because it's like one of the most important stories we have.
5893320	5894120	Not everybody knows it.
5894760	5900680	You have a problem that you've got three lines coming into a point and there's a failure of
5900680	5902040	conservation of momentum.
5902040	5905080	And so you have to hypothesize a fourth line.
5905080	5909800	You had a different problem when Dirac came out with his theory, which is, is that he only had
5909800	5912600	the electron and the proton, they were oppositely charged.
5912600	5915640	So we decided that one was the antiparticle of the other.
5915640	5920680	Instead, this is the part, you know, similar to the Peter Parker-Clarke-Kent issue,
5920680	5925400	he should have hypothesized a positron to be the anti-electron, to be the anti-electron
5925400	5929080	and an antiproton to be the antiparticle of the familiar proton.
5929080	5931240	That move was too much.
5931240	5933720	And in fact, Heisenberg chastised it.
5933720	5937800	There's an issue about understanding how spin comes about.
5937800	5942760	So effectively, when I've said that the square root is the psychedelic of mathematics,
5942760	5949000	you have to give your computer program psychedelics effectively so that it can invent new stuff.
5949000	5954760	That is, I can join something called i or i, j and k to solve a problem that was posed in the
5954760	5955320	real numbers.
5955320	5958680	And then I get the quaternions with complex numbers or even the actonians.
5958680	5964120	I'm going to augment my theory of something called differential forms to something called
5964120	5965480	the theory of spinners.
5965480	5970120	Can you discover something called the fofian, which is the square root of the determinant
5970120	5972120	for a particular class of matrices?
5972120	5976040	Can you discover that the Euler class is in a certain sense the square root of something
5976040	5977800	called the Pontriagin class?
5977800	5983960	All of these things are these non-trivial moves where something that is not present in
5983960	5991080	the initial formulation is guessable as the thing that would be needed to complete the
5991080	5995320	stuff that we can see with stuff that we can't to get a consistent system.
5996120	6002440	If you can teach a computer about primitives and give it the ability to guess outside of
6002440	6006360	the system that you've taught it so that it can self-adjoin.
6006440	6009320	And I don't see any impediment to this currently.
6009320	6014440	You would have a system that would be potent enough to explore not only the theory that
6014440	6018600	you feed it, but the theories that it can build from that theory.
6018600	6022840	And in essence, the computer program is being asked to do something similar than what we're
6022840	6024840	asking theoretical physics to do.
6024840	6029000	Again, everybody complains about how complicated this is and I'm sick and tired and bored of
6029000	6029880	hearing it.
6029880	6030840	Steven's correct.
6030840	6035080	You do have to learn some level of mathematics.
6035080	6039560	Typically, this would be somewhat like learning the French language before exploring French
6039560	6040040	literature.
6040920	6042840	Yeah, it's expensive.
6042840	6044840	If you want to learn a foreign language, it costs money.
6045400	6049640	In time, same thing for learning differential geometry in quantum field theory.
6049640	6056360	The situation that we're facing is that your computer program has to be capable of building
6056360	6061880	larger worlds by adjoining things that would make puzzles in the worlds that it knows about
6061880	6062680	make sense.
6062680	6068600	And that process of inferential guessing outside of anything that's been taught is a different
6068600	6073880	problem than the problem of finding, let's say, chess moves or go moves by being able to search
6073880	6077000	a larger space where the search space is implicit in the rules.
6077640	6080120	So do I believe that it requires AGI?
6080120	6086120	Now, one of the stories that I don't think we talk that much about is how much we thought AGI or
6086120	6090760	artificial general intelligence would be needed to do all sorts of things.
6090760	6095000	And the great surprise is we don't need anything like artificial general intelligence
6095000	6098600	to do most of the things that supposedly intelligence systems now do.
6099160	6104440	We thought that AGI and our consciousness and our intelligence was necessary.
6104440	6107320	It turns out that much less is usually necessary.
6107320	6111880	It is entirely possible that we don't need to wait around and we can have the computers guess it.
6111880	6118600	And to the issue of atheism and the simulators and the simulated, we have two separate stories,
6118600	6125160	one story in which we are going to build the intelligence, the AGI fear, which it's going
6125160	6126360	to be smarter than us.
6126360	6131000	We have another one in which we are the simulated and there's the simulated tour somewhere else.
6131000	6137160	If you put the two stories together, you see that in a weird way, God should be scared about us
6137160	6140680	becoming intelligence when we finally learn what our source code is.
6140680	6143560	This is the moment where Skynet becomes self-aware.
6143560	6146760	And the thing that nobody sees coming is that we are the AI.
6146760	6150120	We are the AGI that emerged in somebody else's system.
6150120	6153880	And whether or not that somebody else was sentient or not is a different question.
6153880	6155400	But Einstein asked this thing.
6155400	6158280	He said, I don't care about the spectrum or this or that element.
6158280	6162840	What really bothers me is whether or not the creator had any choice or what interests me
6162840	6165800	is whether the creator had any choice in the way the world was made.
6165800	6170440	This is an interesting concept of not being all powerful, but being all constrained.
6171080	6176760	And perhaps the creator's sole function, if you will, is to turn on the lights.
6176760	6178600	And everything else follows from that.
6178600	6185160	This is sort of a Leibnizian monad construction where the idea is that the rules effectively
6185160	6189000	tell us what is going to happen and there's very little room for anything else.
6189000	6194680	But I think that part of the reason we keep asking these questions is to be blunt pessimism.
6194680	6199160	Rather than working on the actually hard stuff, either in Stephen's case of trying to do it
6199160	6204520	through computation or my case of trying to remain within the standard mathematical tool kit.
6204520	6209320	People are so frustrated that we waste our lives talking about the mathematical universe
6209320	6212040	hypothesis, the simulation hypothesis.
6212040	6217000	We do all sorts of nonsensical work on theories that have nothing to do with physical reality.
6217000	6222920	And I just think it would be better if we stopped wasting our time talking around physics
6222920	6224520	and started talking about physics itself.
6224520	6226360	Well, guys, I have to go.
6227080	6229000	You guys have been so generous with your time.
6229000	6231640	You've answered a lot of questions that the audience had.
6231640	6237000	And for that, I'm very thankful from both coasts.
6237000	6238760	Any final words, Stephen?
6238760	6243000	I did think there was going to be one question you wanted to ask us about peer review
6243000	6245400	and our attitudes towards it, which I think people are going to want to know.
6245400	6247000	I think we should wrap it up.
6247000	6251880	Maybe we'll take that up on a future podcast with you guys individually.
6251880	6257400	The time has really come to go, or I'll be in a lot of trouble with a multiverse of children
6257400	6258200	screaming at me.
6258920	6263000	Stephen, anything you'd like to leave the audience with, any way that they can engage
6263000	6266920	and perhaps participate in the exciting work of Wolfram Research?
6266920	6268680	Use Wolfram Language, use Wolfram Alpha.
6269880	6274280	You can come to live streams we do frequently about the physics project.
6274280	6276360	You can look at the physics website.
6276360	6280440	You'll find all of the programs and things there.
6280440	6284520	It seems like people are finding this stuff, which is great.
6284520	6288760	And we'll put a link to the YouTube channel where folks can find your many, many live streams
6288760	6290280	and presentations as well.
6290280	6294280	Eric, something for closeout, where can people find you and engage with you?
6294280	6295560	Come find us at the portal.
6295560	6299160	I think there's also an Eric Weinstein.org.
6299160	6303960	Look for the Geometric Unity presentation, which was a special presentation within the
6303960	6304840	Portal series.
6304840	6311160	I am looking forward to hosting Stephen getting into the thick of his theory and how it works.
6311160	6315960	I think that one of the things that people should get engaged with is both why people
6315960	6319240	are so pessimistic and negative about every new emergence.
6319240	6323400	You should learn about the no-go theorems and all of the things that a theory would have to fit.
6323400	6324920	I don't think people are particularly negative.
6324920	6327720	I mean, honestly, we've been playing up the negativism.
6327720	6333480	But honestly, what I'm seeing is people being very enthusiastic about what we're doing.
6334280	6336840	So far, I haven't seen anybody.
6336840	6342840	I'd be interested to hear from somebody credible who says, I mean, you've said,
6342840	6343880	I don't believe your theory.
6343880	6345560	Wait a second.
6347400	6354040	No, I believe that your theory is either going to reproduce a lot of what it is that we already
6354040	6355960	know and then tell us something new potentially.
6357480	6358680	I'm not disagreeing with it.
6358680	6361960	I've said that it might be a face up to some common subject.
6361960	6363560	It's certainly not the face that I'm taking.
6365560	6368760	We should hash that out when we do each other's podcasts.
6369640	6373160	The issue that I wanted to get to, though, is, yeah, there is a lot of negativity.
6373160	6374920	You can read about it in the Reddit comments.
6374920	6378440	You can read about it very often left in the YouTube comments.
6378440	6380520	Some people in the field are very disgruntled.
6380520	6383400	Very few people have wanted to say, I've waited in.
6383400	6384760	I've tried to look at it.
6384760	6386280	I've really kind of to understand it.
6386280	6388440	And I still think these guys are talking crap.
6388440	6395000	I think Steven's exactly right that the coincidence of his work and my work being on the same show,
6395000	6397000	I don't see any need to fit them together.
6398840	6402040	And I think that if they're both right, then they would have to be fit together.
6402040	6406120	And most probably, of course, they're both wrong because that we have to say these words.
6407000	6413880	With that said, get excited about people who are trying to find ways out of the learned
6413880	6418840	helplessness that comes out of the no-go theorems, the pessimism that came out of the LHC.
6419560	6420600	I disagree with Steven.
6420600	6426680	I still think that there is a core community that's angry that people outside are speaking to the world
6426680	6427160	through this direction.
6427160	6427960	They may be angry about you.
6427960	6430600	I don't think they're very angry about me, at least not that.
6430600	6431080	Yeah, maybe they were.
6431080	6432040	There is pessimism.
6432040	6433720	I think Eric's talking specifically.
6433720	6436920	I guarantee you there are people angry about you too, Steven.
6436920	6438520	It's not just about me.
6438520	6443880	It's in general that we're all up against a question where nobody has any precedent.
6443880	6448120	I think people have one thing that I think is the case is that what I've noticed,
6448120	6451560	for example, about peer review, which we're not going to talk about here in detail,
6451560	6456680	but it's the people who say peer review is amazing.
6456680	6460520	We need peer review on not people inside science.
6460520	6464920	They're not people who actually know it up close because up close, it's actually people.
6464920	6466360	In fact, one thing's kind of amusing.
6466360	6471320	We set up a peer review system for our project and to date,
6471320	6474520	not a single person has submitted a peer review.
6474520	6475320	Not a single person.
6475320	6476600	It's been several months now.
6476600	6480200	How can people submit reviews of it?
6480200	6482360	It just says there's just a link that says peer review.
6482360	6484920	It's next to each one of our documents.
6484920	6486120	I encourage people to do it.
6486120	6487720	I mean, honestly, I'm disappointed.
6487720	6491720	I thought at least a few people would do it, even if they were like,
6491720	6493880	I didn't really read this, but it's all nonsense anyway.
6494760	6498840	But what we actually asked for, more specifically, which I think is useful,
6498840	6504360	is somebody to say, I read section 3.7, and I think it's correct,
6504360	6506600	or I think there's this mistake in it or whatever else.
6506600	6509640	We have had people like Sabine Hossenfeldt, an eminent scientist,
6509640	6513080	and she's written a video, which is the first time you guys appeared together,
6513080	6514920	where she criticizes these theories.
6514920	6517560	And she's an eminent fundamental theorist.
6517560	6520120	We've been an email correspondence with her,
6520120	6523240	and she asked a bunch of questions, which were very valid questions.
6523240	6528200	So we gave her answers, and she disappeared.
6528760	6533240	So if she's still saying she doesn't know what's going on, then there's a problem.
6533880	6536520	Well, the fact is, is that you've answered her questions.
6536520	6539880	She had questions that were reasonable, and that's the beginning of the process.
6539880	6543080	Then if she continues to say, well, he hasn't answered my questions
6543080	6545400	after he's answered the questions, and she hasn't responded,
6545400	6546520	then we're in a different situation.
6546520	6547080	Yeah, then we can actually-
6547080	6551800	I know Sabine can be kind of gruff and unpleasant,
6551800	6555480	but I know her to be reasonably fair in most circumstances.
6555480	6557160	Very good. Thank you guys.
6557160	6559960	You guys are really spectacular.
6559960	6562760	It's so generous of you to spend your time,
6562760	6566280	and we got to see different sides of your ideas
6566280	6572360	and try to reach some sense of different approaches that are radically different,
6572360	6574600	and perhaps, but they have the same common goal,
6574600	6578040	which is to really introduce the world to concepts
6578520	6582520	take us out of our quotidian existence of politics, sports, and whatever,
6582520	6583640	the grandest concepts.
6583640	6585560	I think we should have talked about those here.
6585560	6587400	That would have been more interesting for me.
6587400	6593160	Let's do more where we actually treat the people who want to get into the meat of it,
6593160	6594200	because I think that-
6594200	6597800	No, no. I was saying less meat, because I don't think this was so useful,
6597800	6602200	because I think that I felt like we would have done better talking
6602200	6604360	about kind of the culture of science and so on.
6604360	6606440	I'm sorry. I take all the blame.
6606440	6609240	Yes, I know. I'm sorry. It's my fault for not getting to that.
6609240	6612200	Thank you, Steven. Thank you, Eric. I love your work. Bye, guys.
