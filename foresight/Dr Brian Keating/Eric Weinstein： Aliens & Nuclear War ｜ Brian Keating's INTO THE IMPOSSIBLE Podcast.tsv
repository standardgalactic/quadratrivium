0	11560	Alright, we are live on YouTube. Dr. Brian Keating, Dr. Eric Weinstein, how are you my
11560	13400	friend? I miss you very much.
13400	17400	And I use her. Good to be with you. Is it Cinco de Mayo?
17400	22280	Yes, Feliz Cinco de Mayo. It always comes on the 5th of May, every freaking year. It's
22280	23280	like clockwork.
23280	27080	No, I've decided to celebrate and be festive.
27080	29800	You've got five glasses of tequila like me?
29800	35520	No, I've got the Mexican hat potential on the bottom of my mug.
35520	42800	Well played, sir. Buenos dias to you, my friend. Well, we're going to get in right off the bat.
42800	47680	We're going to talk about the most exciting subjects in your universe. My audience has
47680	55320	missed you as much as I have. And we want to make sure that we kind of give the people
55400	60000	what they're interested in. And that today involves a whole host of issues. We're going
60000	64920	to talk about aliens and a possible new solution to the Fermi Paradox. We're going to talk
64920	72920	about your new and ever-evolving and a good way theories and feelings about cryptocurrencies,
72920	79120	inflation, and so forth. And then we're going to talk about some less controversial subjects
79120	84760	like abortion, Supreme Court leaks, and wherever the day takes it.
84760	86760	How exciting.
86760	95960	Yes, and I was pleased to see recently a man by the name of Musk has kind of taken a new
95960	102800	stance for which he's taking extreme attacks and hostility. And I wondered, Eric, you know,
102800	107440	if he might have a little bit of buyer's remorse right now. Do you feel like this prize, you
107440	111160	know, everyone's always the richest man in the world. That's true. He has five times this
111160	117120	amount. That's true. But, you know, if I, if I, you know, took away your family car, you
117120	120960	would feel it, you know, I would feel it. And so I feel like this is a tremendous amount
120960	125480	of money. And I want to take you back to we started pandemic podcasting together two years
125480	131560	ago, exactly. So, you know, congratulations on our anniversary. But in the in between, there
131560	134960	was this thing called Clubhouse. I don't know if you remember this thing called Clubhouse. And
134960	139000	that was the hottest ticket in the world. Everybody wanted it and get on it. I haven't
139000	143000	used it in months. I don't know about you. Like I said, I don't know, you might be on
143000	147000	there, but I'm not on there. Do you think he might be having buyer's remorse? He think
147000	151320	he might look back and say this was the clubhouse of 2022. Eventually, and I shouldn't have given
151320	155400	up a quarter of my network.
155400	163040	If there is buyer's remorse, my guess is that it hasn't set in yet. Because I believe that
163280	170440	there's a lot of low hanging fruit to improve Twitter. And, you know, Elon, I don't know
170440	178280	Elon at all. I know tons of people who know him. My impression of him from afar is very
178280	185400	confused. He does seem to be in many ways the world's most forward thinking person. At
185400	191080	least at the level of, you know, forward thinking, what can we what can we actually do? So I'm
191120	195520	pretty impressed with him intellectually as a public intellectual. Then, you know, then
195520	201920	there are layers. Then there's the idea that he has to be chaotic. So he is very Trump-like
201920	207840	in many ways in terms of how he uses Twitter and how he attempts not to be constrained.
207840	214320	Because there are going to be SEC rules and lots of lawyers and PR people telling you
214320	218840	can't say this, you can't do that. And he's decided that he wants to be free. And so there's
218880	223080	this paradox, sort of a laugh or curve, when you have no money and when you have lots of
223080	228240	money, you tend to be in a weird way less free than people with intermediate levels. And so in
228240	235200	a strange way, I sort of see him as a very rich person, choosing to put a lot of his wealth at
235200	241280	risk so that he can be free. And that too is very forward thinking. Now, what I know about
241280	248080	Twitter is that current Twitter has all sorts of obviously soluble problems in terms of you can
248120	255160	just fire a bunch of people and you can make rules about algorithmic transparency and the
255160	261440	like. And then when you get to the end of plucking all the low-hanging fruit, then you've got the
261440	269720	problem of the underlying technology allows any person to post something instantly. And you
269720	275160	know, what we've seen is we've seen first-person shooters looking like they come out of a video
275200	282880	game in the Christchurch Mosque Massacre that was, I think, streamed live on Facebook. So the
282880	290440	problem is us. It's not Twitter. It's not the technology. It's the technology hooked up. Lots
290440	300400	of people, many of whom have mental health issues, many of whom are incredibly chaotic, talking
300440	305560	to each other without common background, without an ability to, you know, to know who's going to
305560	314560	post what when. So in that world, I don't think there's a solution. So, you know, the great
314560	323960	danger is that he's bought something and he's got the first 17 fixes lined up. And I don't think
323960	328240	the problem is going to occur then. I think the problem is going to occur once you fixed all of
328240	334800	those things. What are you left with? And you know, one of the things he's signaled, Brian, is that
334800	343200	he believes that removing anonymity will be a large portion of the solution. And I do think it
343200	351440	will do a lot to solve the problems. But there's a hard core of people who are happy to be known,
352440	360080	who are incredibly abusive, and think it's funny. And then there's a very large market for abuse. And
360080	366080	I think people haven't really realized that abuse tends to be one of the most important products
366080	372440	that the internet knows how to distribute. And because you can't sign up for abuse, you can't
372440	377200	say, hey, I want to see who's abusing who today. I'm feeling like I should abuse somebody else. I'm
377200	384440	not feeling so good about myself. When you do that, you realize you can't be honest, that you're
384440	389080	really up for going to the Coliseum to see people get hurt. You're really starting to say, oh, no,
389080	396480	no, no. I'm here for the comedy. It's just comedy. It's just fun. It's just laughs. Or I think this
396480	403120	makes the world a better place. I'm calling people out who are ghoulish and horrible. Well, no,
403360	409200	you're really just up for abuse. And you don't have many ideas and your life is empty. And that's
409200	416240	what you're doing. Okay, that problem of all sorts of people selling this one product that has an
416240	424040	enormous audience for it is going to plague Twitter. So I think that there is buyer's remorse. But I
424040	430200	think Elon can go make more money. What he's trying to do is he's trying to say, we have to have some
430240	437920	property that isn't in control under the, how do I say this? You have to have some major property
438560	448960	that isn't under the control of whatever this wrong woke thing is. And, you know, you have Fox,
449040	463440	you have, I don't know, Newsmax, but these are not major, you know, even the blaze or the daily wire
463480	472000	or daily collar, any of these things, I think, they're not like MSNBC, New York Times, NPR, and the
472000	481240	fact that all of these sort of formally, formally, respectable properties gone completely insane,
482640	491080	haven't broken rank, buying one, and saying, hey, we're not going to change the logo, and we're not
491080	497840	going to change the mast, the mast head completely. But what we are going to do is we are going to
497840	504360	stop making it possible to be ridiculous in this coordinated assault on reality. Now, that's why
504360	513600	everybody on the, it's not the left, Brian, it's like the, it's some sort of a partnership between
513600	522760	the establishment left and their revolutionary army that they deploy to try to undo everything that
522760	526640	gets in the, in the path of what I would call the rent seeking elite who are in control of the
526640	534840	Democratic Party. That, that thing, he's taking that on. And I think you have to look at it. He's
534840	539920	not taking it on necessarily from being a conservative. He's taking it on from saying, I
539920	542360	can't live under these people one second longer.
544080	549800	Yeah. And, you know, I think, looking back at, you know, the history of these platforms, I mean, we
549800	555920	see Facebook kind of falling out of favor. And we saw the massive contributions in the previous
555960	562200	election, election by Zuckerberg, which didn't curry him any favor with the people that obviously he
562200	566880	was advocating for. So I wonder, you know, in this, and I wonder if you saw any of the interviews
566880	573440	that Zuckerberg's been on this, you know, kind of world tour lately on Lex's show and on another
573440	580960	podcast, Tim Ferriss. And no one's really asking him, you know, these really tough questions. So I
580960	586360	wonder, you know, is it, is it really true that we look to these, we look to these people as if
586360	592240	they're so lucky to have the resources to buy this? It seems to me like a nightmare hellscape to
592240	597000	wake up in the morning and have a New York Times hit piece like Elon faces today with his South
597000	601320	African childhood brought into play as if he had choices to where he was born.
602000	602440	Geez.
603040	609160	I just, why don't you just call everything white supremacist? You know, just just get it over
609200	614720	with everybody's a Nazi. Everybody's always why they just waste our time because the New York
614720	621640	Times used to be an important newspaper and, and still capable of doing things. We all have to
621640	629360	have a discussion framed by them. And my feeling is, okay, let's just take some random person, you
629360	634640	know, let's take just give me a generic Republican.
637000	638080	Marco Rubio.
638800	644560	Okay, Marco Rubio. Is there any truth to the fact that he was connected to the Cuban Cuban mafia?
646320	652040	Okay, now we're going to discuss Marco Rubio being connected to the Cuban mafia for no reason other
652040	657560	than the fact that somebody was able to put that question in a sentence at the top of an article.
657680	665640	So my feeling is we can also, why does Marco Rubio seemingly target America's children? Oh, is he
665680	669920	targeting America's children? Like we just changed from the Cuban mafia to some different story.
672520	679880	I think we've got to just stop, start with the idea of shut up. Like, you know, if you don't have
679880	681520	much hush,
683040	687800	that's where I feel like, you know, this, this takeover of Twitter, he took over something, which is
687800	693280	built by people that had an ideological bent against him and have a very clear perspective on what
693280	698400	they want to promote and what they don't want to promote and, and highlight versus not. And I feel
698400	703840	like, again, I feel like it's like a booby prize. I do feel like at some point, even I or you, you
703840	709720	know, would wake up and just say, you know, like, there's so much richness in the world. Like, who
709720	713760	cares to have these battles with people that only get points, the more polarized that they speak, the
713760	718880	more they try to punch up and take down Eric Weinstein, I get, I get like those Dungeons, remember
718920	722960	the Dungeons and Dragons, you know, hit points. If I take Eric's car, you know, I get your hit
722960	728560	points. Well, you've got 690,000 people that fall. Oh, I've only got two. Who gives a fricking
728560	734760	crap? You know, I mean, all these people do remarkably well and without it. And I feel like he's
734760	740160	catering to this tribe of maybe 100,000 semi woke, you know, if you want to call it that,
740280	745240	journalists, people in the Beltway and the corridor in the Northeast and then the West Coast. And why
745240	749720	do you want to spend so much of your money? I mean, again, it's a fifth Brian, Brian, I don't know
749720	755160	what you're asking about. The key issue is we've got to buy one of these things. There has to be a
755160	760800	university that's actually a university, a news service that's actually a news service, a place, a
760800	767080	public square that's a public square. Like, we've lost everything, essentially. And then there's
767080	772920	these false equivalent. Oh, no, no, no, Fox. It's like, look, Fox, I still treat as right wing
772920	782160	propaganda. The major issue is that left leaning properties went insane, as opposed to merely
782160	789800	biased. And, you know, like, there's one of these things with, Hey, remember, we told you that
789800	794960	Ivermectin was horse dewormer that you shouldn't take it? Well, it turns out that if we lose Roe
794960	804160	V. Wade, a horse ulcer medication can be used to induce off label of spontaneous abortions in
804160	810640	humans. So just go to your vet, you're covered. And I'm thinking, Okay, I really appreciate that.
810640	815480	What you're really doing is telling me that you have the right to contradict yourselves and the
815480	821560	rest of us are all hypocrites for simply trying to get through a day, but you have an absolute right
822160	829320	to say whatever you want, whenever you want. That it's a game. And I have to admit, I have caught
829320	834400	people chuckling, like, Hey, did you see what I just put out today? That'll bend their minds because
834400	839320	it contradicts what I said three weeks ago. You're just thinking, Okay, I get it. Everybody's
839320	844840	joyriding. Right. Yeah, right. You get those, I get those adrenaline bumps. And then speaking of
844840	849240	that, you know, this, this thing, I don't know if the deal is actually done or what it is. But in
849240	853880	obviously a lot of it was leaked ahead of time and so forth. And, and you have this like, it's
853880	858520	like the fifth estate now. So, so you have the fourth estate, which is media. And then there's
858520	864280	like this, this leakage class, you know, the people beyond the, beyond the curtain that will
864280	869240	leak the story that eventually does get pipeline directly into the mainstream veins of, of the
869240	873680	fourth estate of journalism. And what do you make of this? I mean, this people are celebrating as
873680	878960	heroes. This leak, you know, to the, to the, from the Supreme Court decision, which, as I
878960	883440	understand it, could put people's lives in danger, right? I don't want to be too specific. But this,
883440	889440	this, this thing has not set a law yet. And regardless of how you feel about it, and I can
889440	894400	hear opinions on both sides. Before I actually, before I get to that, Eric, about two years ago
894400	899280	on the portal, you did this wonderful kind of verbal essay, and everybody's asking when the
899280	904320	portal is going to come back. I hope it'll be soon. No questions asked about that today. But
904880	910000	you did a, you did a wonderful verbal essay in which you talked about the trouble with ambiguity.
910560	915760	And you talked about superpositions and how inharmonious they are for the human mind. And the
915760	920720	human mind hates ambiguity and loves resolution, even if the resolution's wrong. And you talked
920720	925440	about abortion, you talked about gun control. I wonder, could you recapitulate that discussion?
925520	931120	It was in the context of, you know, kind of a Schrodinger state of a baby being real versus
931120	936000	not. Have you changed your opinions? And can you first recap? Can you recount that, that,
936000	941120	that wonderful kind of analogy that you used? Well, yeah, of course, I should listen to the
941120	945360	portal and find out what I, what I said or thought. You know, my usual,
945360	949200	just bring your own words on you. You remember that Charles Barkley said he was, he was taken
949200	956880	out of context in his own autobiography. So we're not in that company. Well, you know, the famous
959600	964240	description of one of my favorite classical music pieces, St. Saint-San second piano concerto,
964240	970320	is that it begins with Bach and ends with often Bach. And conception, you know, it begins
971840	975440	when you're talking about terminating a pregnancy, it sort of begins with
975520	982560	spermicide and ends in infanticide. And anything that has that property of being on a continuum
982560	988720	that connects something incredibly trivial to something unthinkable, but naturally, you know,
988720	995040	through the intermediate value theorem, there's got to be some point where that thing becomes
995760	1004400	a meaningful life. And the political expediency has said, we're going to turn this into an
1004400	1010640	intellectual football, right? And so one side is going to pretend that something is a baby,
1010640	1019280	the instant the sperm nudge is close to the egg. And somebody else is going to pretend that it's
1019280	1028320	just the mother's body four seconds before delivery. Okay, well, there's a black hole
1028320	1033040	that I don't want to get into, because what they're really saying is we know that we've
1033040	1039120	got to make this wrong statement in order to get where we need to go. And if you won't make the
1039120	1045360	wrong statement with us, you're Hitler. It's like, okay, so add Hitler to white supremacists.
1045360	1051280	It's just, look, Brian, this is all so dumb. It's so innervating. I mean, the real issue is we
1051280	1057440	should go back to reading Griswold, you know, before row, where we get the penumbra argument.
1057440	1061840	I think it's advanced by William O. Douglas in the Warren Court. And we should ask ourselves,
1061840	1066640	how sophisticated is that decision? And then, you know, the issue with row,
1067520	1074000	of course, is that for its time, there was no plan B. Back in that day, the world was a very
1074000	1078640	different place. You know, there are arguments in all different directions. I don't want to get
1078640	1086960	into any of that, because the issue, you know, suffice it to say, I behave pretty much as a
1086960	1092640	pro-choice person early on in the pregnancy. And I've, you know, protested in the streets
1093280	1100960	in order to make sure that women have safe legal access to disposing of their pregnancies early
1100960	1110480	on. And I'm pretty pro-baby's rights right before, you know, somebody's about to give birth. And
1110800	1117200	they can't go to anybody's party. Yeah, I mean, I remember my dad of a blessed memory. He used
1117200	1123840	to joke, you know, on my 33rd birthday, he said, I believe in abortion up until the 99th trimester.
1123840	1130400	And, you know, but now it's not a joke. I mean, you have people that are effectively saying,
1130400	1135360	you know, such things as, you know, a pregnant person, of course, we have to be respectful.
1135360	1139920	It's amazing how we went from we can't define what a woman is with regard to the Supreme Court.
1140560	1149360	The media stuff. I value your time and my time. And we can get into like, trans, what are they
1149360	1155600	thinking? Or do you know what someone's always been accused of next? And my feeling is, this is my
1155600	1160640	only time on this planet. And I have, you know, an esteemed physicist colleague, a worldly guy.
1161520	1167280	I don't want to talk about any of the ridiculously stupid stuff that everybody wants us to talk about.
1167600	1171840	All right. Well, thanks for joining the Into the Impossible podcast.
1171840	1175840	It's been a pleasure. And please like comment and subscribe.
1177040	1182720	Women get pregnant and give birth. And we should call some number of biological men, women, I think,
1183680	1188880	because there is a programming issue, but this has gotten out of hand. And I'm not going to sort
1188880	1193120	it out with you on this particular program. And we haven't lost our mind. And I'm not going to throw
1193120	1204960	biology out the window because, you know, Renee Richards is upset. We have to be compassionate
1205680	1211760	and deal with everybody in our society. We should be kind. And we can't lose our minds at the same
1211760	1217600	time. And we failed. And we failed to have these discussions. We failed to talk about the reality
1217600	1222560	of pregnancy. We won't sit down with Carnegie Stages and embryonic development and say,
1222560	1227840	when does the neural tube and the neural crest form? And what is the richness of neural activity
1227840	1233920	and all these kinds of things that matter to me? Instead, we're going to try to talk to each other.
1233920	1237920	Pro-life, no, pro-choice, no, pro-life. Let's let somebody else do it.
1239680	1242640	All right. Well, let's pivot to another existential crisis.
1242640	1245280	Well, no, no. I'm going to get to the leak.
1245280	1248000	All right. Yes. I want to talk about the leak. Okay. Let's go back to that. Yeah.
1248400	1255920	I think it's important. I just had a conversation with somebody I've known very long time as a
1255920	1262080	lawyer last night. And the lawyer said, you know, it's wrong to leak. And I probably would have
1262080	1269520	considered it. And I said, why? Oh, because I think it's so important that women have
1269520	1273600	access to reproductive rights that even the unthinkable should be done.
1273600	1288240	Okay. I appreciated the candor. I think that's insane. I mean, I think that what's really
1288240	1296400	becoming very clear is that very few of us trust democracy, trust the court, trust our scientists.
1296400	1306320	The level of loss of trust has led to a large number of us unwilling to carry the culture
1307680	1312080	of the United States that animates the Constitution and its other governing document.
1312800	1319040	I think this is something I don't know how to communicate. If you don't carry the culture
1319040	1323520	of the United States, which is that you're willing to believe in a fiction that nine
1323600	1330320	druids can discern the meaning of the Constitution and legal conflict, which is, I'm going to say it
1330320	1339680	right here. It's a fiction. But I agree to that fiction. I agree to the fiction that a majority
1339680	1345440	of the electoral college or one day maybe the electorate has the wisdom, the best wisdom available
1345440	1352240	to choose the president, blah, blah, blah. I think many of us have decided that they don't feel,
1352320	1357520	we don't feel like carrying the culture. And without the culture, it's a piece of parchment
1357520	1363280	with ink. There's nothing more. If you can't animate the document, if you're unwilling
1364160	1368880	to pretend to believe in the things that are necessary to keep the experiment running, because
1368880	1375040	it's like, no, with Merrick Garland, that's out the window. No, with Bork. It's ridiculous. No,
1375040	1379280	no, no, you don't understand. The activism on the Warren court destroyed the... Okay. Look,
1380000	1385280	I know all of the right-wing complaints about the left and the judiciary, and I know all of the
1385280	1392080	complaints in reverse. And there's two separate stories. And I'm like, I feel like I'm the middle
1392080	1396640	child. It's like, you idiots are going to lose us everything. Oh, you want to pack the court? Oh,
1396640	1403120	you want to do this? Okay. No fellow buster. Right. We're not going to survive this, you morons.
1403680	1408960	And, you know, my feeling about this is my desire to watch Joe Biden, Donald Trump,
1411200	1417120	all of these, these people are not going to be around for that long. My kids have a lot of
1417120	1424480	runtime left. I just worry that what we haven't realized is that a giant chunk of both parties
1424480	1427200	have gone revolutionary. They don't believe in the country.
1427440	1434800	How does that bode for the remainder of the union of these states then?
1438480	1445520	I think we don't realize what we're doing. You know, I have this memory of being on a school bus
1445520	1453920	when I was a little kid and figuring out that if I could get the kids to sway back and forth
1453920	1462480	in unison, we could actually have a large effect in aggregate. And we started swaying the bus,
1462480	1467760	and the bus was really like rocking at some incredible level, just from all of these kids
1467760	1471040	going back and forth. And once they figured out that this was real, they got more and more
1471040	1478000	enthusiastic. And it felt like we were pretty close to being in danger of actually getting the
1478000	1485280	bus to do something it wasn't supposed to do. Now, I feel like that's what we're doing,
1485280	1489520	is that we have this idea that the bus represents like adulthood. There's nothing you can do to
1489520	1495280	take down the United States of America. It's some super stable superpower. You can mouth off. It's
1495280	1501840	not true. We are now in danger of disassembling this beautiful experiment because we're bored.
1502800	1508160	And we're like mischievous, and we want to have fun. So maybe we'll riot the streets this summer.
1508160	1514080	Summer is coming up. There's always a good idea to have mostly peaceful gatherings, and we can
1515360	1519840	call each other names and bring some guns, and then we can discuss who shot whom.
1522720	1528560	I think you've got more kids than I can remember. You probably have the same
1528560	1532480	number as the last time we spoke, but I'm not even positive of that. No abortions.
1535440	1541120	In Maurice Sendix, where the wild things are, he says, let the wild rumpus start.
1542400	1555040	Yeah. I think that's the wild rumpus. Yeah, exactly. Since we talked last in late December,
1556000	1563520	we did record about a month ago. We may release that at some point. But we've had this existential
1563520	1573440	crisis looming in Eastern Europe. And I wonder if we can kind of think about that. That rumpus
1573440	1577680	governed by the same clan of people you just talked about with the addition of somebody who
1577680	1583600	brings the average age of the discussants down slightly closer to 70, the Vladimir Putin,
1584240	1590320	who I understand he's not well. I believe he is undergoing some surgery, so I don't know if
1590320	1598080	people are going to send thoughts and prayers to that particular individual. But now things are
1598080	1602800	getting serious. And I remember not too long ago, you advocated for something, and I was like,
1602800	1609680	he can't be serious. My God, he can't be serious. And that was for a demonstration event of the
1609680	1617440	awesomeness of the release of the binding energy between nucleons. And that was a call to
1618480	1624800	a demonstration of the fearful power of the wildest rumpus of all, which is nuclear or
1624800	1632080	thermonuclear weapons. And you advocated for a non-radioactive but still thermonuclear
1633200	1639200	detonation, so to speak, of the kind that we could witness, obviously not on catastrophic
1639200	1644160	scale. But I wonder what was, at first I was shocked. I thought, Eric's being a provocative
1644160	1649200	tour. What's the thinking behind that? What would that do for humanity to see such a thing?
1649200	1657920	You can see for yourself, we've lost our fear of the sun. We can create what the sun does on earth,
1660640	1662000	and we're not afraid of it anymore.
1662160	1672880	Look, I can't easily talk about Ukraine at the moment, because I am so isolated from the rest
1672880	1682800	of you all. If I start talking about this, it becomes very clear that we're distracting
1682800	1688240	ourselves with everything else. And so I understand that we've decided to distract ourselves, to not
1688240	1695360	take this seriously, to trifle with Armageddon, and to have fun with it. We've got a handsome Jewish
1695360	1699440	guy who loves his wife with one of the great lines of all time.
1702960	1707600	You know what the line is? I need ammunition, not a ride.
1709680	1713600	Right? And so it's like, oh my god, nobody's, nobody's ever done anything that masculine,
1713600	1718080	and I'm kind of excited. It's like, okay, so now we're going to have a planet that is
1718080	1724560	coked up on the testosterone, testosterone of Ukraine's head of state,
1726240	1735680	and we're going to trifle with Armageddon as if this is fun, or okay, or hey, let's redo the
1735680	1743440	early part of the 20th century before we had the nuclear weapon. And my assessment is that
1744400	1749360	it is more likely that you are all sane, and that I am insane because of the odds.
1751040	1756160	But I think it's the reverse. I think when I called for a return to above-ground nuclear testing,
1756160	1763520	I saw that the Cold War wasn't over. And I saw a world of people whose brains have been restructured
1763520	1768560	by their phone. Like, I'll just give you something from Miami. I was in Miami. Was it a wonderful
1768560	1774640	dinner? Very successful guy picked up the tab. But when the topic came up, he said, you know,
1774640	1779120	the thing about all-out nuclear war is I'm not really worried about all-out nuclear war. I'm
1779120	1786880	worried about re-establishing credibility in the markets afterwards. And I thought, got it.
1786880	1796560	But we're not, I'm not in the same conversation. So I think that to be blunt about it, I've gone
1796560	1803200	crazy. And I'm telling you how important above-ground nuclear testing with radiation,
1806800	1812720	you know, a lot of the radiation, the permanent radiation comes from the, I guess, the fission
1812720	1819840	reaction that is turned into the fusion reaction, thanks to the geometry of Teller and Ulam. And
1821040	1829200	I think that it is a question of self-preservation. I think you cannot have this many people completely.
1833520	1839280	I've gone crazy. I believe that we are trifling with Armageddon. And if we get onto this topic,
1839280	1845280	I will just sound like the most unbalanced person you've heard.
1845280	1853040	Well, I don't think so. And here's the reason why. If we look at the writings of our mutual friend,
1853040	1859920	David Kaiser, the Girmenschenhausen Professor at MIT of Science Technology Studies, a good friend,
1860560	1865600	truly a wonderful individual, he wrote a book about the quantum legacy, I think it's called.
1865600	1871280	And it's about kind of twin nuclei in your language, but more not the biological nuclei,
1871280	1878400	but sort of the contemporaneous development of nuclear weapons of space travel and of the
1878400	1884000	interest in aliens and events like Roswell and so forth, that that wasn't coincidental, that they
1884000	1890720	were all sort of synergistically related, and it wasn't purely serendipitous. And his claim,
1890720	1899120	I think is now being taken up as one of the possible explanations of Fermi's Paradox.
1899120	1903840	So I'm going to ask you first to define Fermi's Paradox, and then I'm going to read this paper,
1903840	1908080	which is behind a paywall, but I'm going to give value to my audience. So on this channel,
1908080	1914720	we do nothing if not give value. And this is going to be a website, which you will thank me for in
1914720	1919760	your dreams, and it gets you over paywalls. I will reveal that in just a minute. So stay
1919760	1924000	tuned for that. That's what we call foreshadowing in the business area. First of all, what is the
1924000	1931040	Fermi Paradox? Is it significant? Does it rise to the level of the Twin Paradox, of the Xenos
1931040	1937040	Paradox, or is it merely a stepping stone into a bigger series of questions? Fermi Paradox, please.
1938800	1942160	Well, I would rather hear it from an astrophysicist than...
1942160	1947280	Fine. There happens to be one right here. So Fermi did the calculation even back in the 50s of how
1947280	1954080	many stars there were, how likely it was to have life in other planets, sort of precursor to what's
1954080	1959040	called the Drake equation, and he came up with this estimate based on the very large number of stars
1959040	1964000	known in the Milky Way galaxy, even at that point, not taking into account galaxies outside of the
1964000	1970880	Milky Way. And he said the overwhelming odds are that there are other civilizations, other aliens,
1971520	1976640	and so he asked one of these questions after the calculations that he was famous for, the so-called
1976640	1982800	Fermi calculations. He said, where are they? If the odds are, there's tremendous numbers of these
1982800	1988080	civilizations of advanced extraterrestrial technology, capable species, not slime mold.
1989520	1994720	Oh, by the way, Eric, I wanted to ask this of my friends on Twitter, but I'm too scared to ask
1994720	2000160	it, so I'll ask it of you. If we found an embryo, like a human fetus, let's say it's a three-month
2000160	2005840	development gestation, and it's on the planet, you know, Procyon B, you know, Trappist 1,
2006880	2012240	what do you think the community of astronomers would do? I mean, would they say, ah, it's nothing,
2012240	2018320	you know, let's abort it? I mean, is that an interesting litmus test to you of how we would
2018320	2022640	react if we saw a fetus? Whatever age you want to say, 10 days, 20 days, it has a heartbeat,
2022640	2027920	it's just sitting there on some planet in some exosolar planet. Is that relevant to the conversation
2027920	2036400	of abortion at all? I don't even know. It's like a Boltzmann brain, but it's a Boltzmann fetus.
2036400	2044880	Boltzmann fetus. Okay. Whatever you're smoking, you've not sent me any of it. I did see an enormous
2044880	2051520	mushroom the other day on your channel, and this is an exciting new direction for middle-aged.
2051600	2059520	Never lick the mushroom. Never lick the mushroom. Okay. Look, we seem to be very afraid to believe,
2061520	2070240	and, you know, let me just get over the hump. I don't believe we're the only life in the universe.
2070240	2078880	I don't know how common or how rare it is. I don't know whether or not there are ways of
2079520	2085840	evading. I don't know whether Einstein's restrictions passed through to all successor theories to
2085840	2093040	relativity. You know, Einstein may have done something to Newton, but he didn't do everything
2093040	2102640	to Newton's conservation law, if you know properly understood. So we don't know what the source of
2102720	2109200	our apparent aloneness is, but apparent may be doing a fair amount of heavy lifting,
2110880	2116880	and what I've offered up is the Fermi Paradox that I know. The only Fermi Paradox that I know
2116880	2123920	is the one on North Sentinel Island in the Andaman chain, because the islanders are effectively
2123920	2129040	Indians, but they don't know that they're Indians. They may not even know that India exists or that
2129040	2137360	India claims North Sentinel Island or that it won't let anyone land there. And my other claim
2137360	2148400	is that I believe that a good chunk of humanity has stumbled into a very appealing wrong idea.
2148400	2154240	So first I want to talk about the appeal of the wrong idea. The wrong idea is the more we find
2154320	2160160	out, the more we realize how little we understand. There's something like really comforting about
2160160	2168000	this. And imagine that you apply this generally. The longer I'm in love, the more I realize how
2168000	2173280	little I understand about the human heart. Oh, that's beautiful. But then you apply it to real
2173280	2180640	things. The longer I study continental exploration, the more I realize that every new land mass
2181440	2186000	we find on Earth is just an indication of how many land masses we have yet to find.
2186720	2192160	That's like the dumbest thing you could possibly say, but it has the same basic feeling. Well,
2192160	2200160	I think we're almost at the end. I think we are afraid to say something which has always been
2200160	2206160	false in the past. Now, the thing is, we're almost at the end of the rules of physics.
2206720	2214080	When somebody says that, everyone says, yeah, Lord Kelvin said that they thought that that was true
2214080	2218320	when they had the proton and the electron. And then they found the neutron. Okay. Well,
2219680	2224560	yes. And it was always true that powered human flight was never going to happen because it had
2224560	2229840	never happened until it happened. And it was the same thing. You know, there's this land mass off
2229840	2235680	of Siberia that I think was discovered in the 20th century, which is the last major land mass to be
2235680	2244640	found. Nobody's worried about the idea that there are uncharted desert isles on Earth because we
2244640	2250720	have the satellite there. We're about at the end of physics, I think. Now, that could be wrong.
2251600	2256800	The easiest way for it to be wrong is that we would be at the end of this chapter,
2256800	2260240	but it would be a book with many chapters and you have to finish this chapter to know that there
2260240	2267280	are chapters to follow. Okay. What if for the moment, I take the contrarian position and say,
2267280	2273120	no, no, no, I think this is about to wrap up. And the really weird thing is that it's taken
2274000	2285040	from 1945 until the present for us to get close. That's a the blink of an eye in cosmic time.
2285760	2290160	But my belief is, is that if anything is monitoring us, and if I'm not wrong,
2292080	2298080	right before you have the full power of the laws of physics, you let off a nuke.
2299200	2304160	And then you go from fission to fusion. And so the concern that I have is, first of all,
2304160	2310080	that the Fermi paradox on North Sentinel Island is the same as the Fermi paradox we have here on
2310080	2315200	Earth, where we are in the North Sentinelese, and we're trying to guess that India exists.
2316560	2322400	So my question to you is, first of all, is there some sort of a thing that doesn't want us
2322400	2329680	contacted that is shielding us the way India shields North Sentinel Island? And is it the case
2329680	2334640	that whatever it is, is, you know, while we think, oh, well, geez, Sam Harris, my friend, said,
2335520	2341600	whoever is out there must be, you know, millions of years and more advanced. They would view us as
2341600	2356160	aphids, nonsense. There is probably a level of sophistication where it kind of taps out.
2357360	2361360	And, you know, you can build bigger and bigger computers, but you're not going to discover
2361440	2365360	more land masses on Earth, and I don't know that you're going to discover more laws of physics.
2366240	2372160	I'm concerned, quite honestly, that we've lost our fear of the cosmos, just the way we've lost
2372160	2377360	our fear of nukes. We've become relatively certain that nothing ever happens here, that we won't be
2377360	2386000	visited, that there's nothing else other than us. And I'm worried that what we did is we alerted
2386000	2390720	whatever is out there, hey, we're just about at the end, and we haven't worked out our stuff,
2390720	2395120	and we're going to be able to get off this rock if you are able to get off this rock.
2395680	2401280	I mean, to come visit this rock, rather. So if things can visit us, we can leave.
2402880	2406320	Now, it may be that all the planets are, you know, rushing away from each other
2407120	2413840	because of the expansion of the metric of space-like splices in the universe. But
2414640	2424960	if the next theory has the power to get us really far, really easily, and far might be,
2424960	2433600	in many dimensions, not all of them spatial, I would be very worried that whatever is watching us
2434400	2435440	knows how close we are.
2437840	2443280	So, I mean, we have to admit the mastodon in the room is that we have no evidence.
2443280	2450160	There's life elsewhere. I stole that from Sir Roger Penrose. And we hear this, Lee Cronin,
2450160	2457200	and my friend, Sarah Walker, they were just on Lex, and they're talking very, very specifically
2457200	2461360	about the traits and characteristics of these aliens, and what they're going to be like,
2461360	2465120	and how you can calculate exactly how much structure went into them, and how you could
2465120	2470800	detect them, and it's all very interesting, and it's rooted in sound, chemical, and physical
2470800	2477440	reasoning. But there's still this huge, you know, lacuna, which is that there's zero evidence. And
2477440	2482480	in fact, I want to try, I want to try something out on you, an argument that I have, which will
2482480	2489440	sound dirty, but it's not, and you know it's not. And it's called panspermia, panspermia, okay.
2489440	2495760	Now, it sounds dirty, but it involves the exchange of material between planets in our solar system
2495760	2501440	and other solar systems, perhaps. And you talked to Avi Loeb, our mutual friend,
2502080	2509680	not too long ago in Miami also, while he was down there with you. And he talked about the
2510400	2516000	almost, you know, definite admission by the U.S. government that an extraterrestrial meteorite
2516560	2522000	had landed from another solar system in the somewhere in the ocean on Earth. And that was
2522000	2526320	obtained. And I love Avi. I'm, you know, like you, you know, kind of helping him out on his
2526320	2533840	Project LAO. So we're both, you know, kind of Avi maximalists to use mixed metaphors. But Avi,
2534400	2538800	you know, claims this is there, and it's based on trajectory data, highly controversial people,
2538800	2544640	you know, can't reproduce it. But at any rate, if true, highlights the fact that materials,
2544640	2549600	such as this meteorite, I've given you several of these, and you tried to snort one once.
2549600	2555200	Anyway, these are meteorites. They come from Argentina. They're delivered by gravity and the
2555200	2563280	U.S. Postal Service. They're hard iron, silicon, and cobalt. They're highly magnetic. And they came,
2563280	2566960	and they smashed into Earth. Now, there are meteorites that I will never give to you,
2566960	2571280	because they cost as much as my first, you know, two cars put together. I have,
2571280	2576800	and it came from the planet Mars. So I have a chunk of Mars in my, in my lab. And that
2576800	2582880	chunk of Mars was proven by gas chromatography and other tools to originate from Mars. Okay.
2582880	2587440	Now, how did it get here? Same way. Blasted off of Mars by a Martian meteorite,
2587440	2591200	kicked around the solar system for a few million years, landed on Earth in Northwest Africa.
2591920	2598320	Now, the same process happens in reverse. Life carrying molecules could be embedded on rocks,
2598320	2602400	and, you know, a chunk of a whale gets kicked out into space, and then eventually lands on Mars,
2602400	2606240	right? But we have no evidence of that. We have no evidence of that happening
2606240	2610160	over billions of years. Now, this could, this could, this has been happening as long as life
2610160	2614960	has been on Earth, which Lee and others tell me is four billion years. So you have four billion
2614960	2621120	years of opportunity to have panspermic transfers of life that we know exist on Earth,
2621120	2624800	going to other parts of our solar system. And there's zero evidence, not, you know,
2624800	2629840	I'm not asking for terraformed, you know, plateaus on Venus, just saying there's no evidence. Now,
2629840	2635760	absence of evidence isn't proof of absence, but shouldn't, at some point, people start to take
2635760	2643360	the lack of, you know, any sort of data or what have you as troubling in a Bayesian sense, that
2643360	2649520	you can't put a prior that is so certain, close to 100% Lee tells me, that he believes aliens are
2649520	2653520	inevitable, and you sound like you believe it as well. So, I want to ask you, what level,
2653520	2657840	what would it take you to believe that aliens don't exist? Alien life, forget about intelligent,
2657840	2662640	just life. Anywhere in the universe? Anywhere else in the universe. What would, I mean, what would
2662640	2666720	I have to ask? What piece of evidence would you have to have to know that's impossible,
2666720	2669680	that, you know, it's impossible for life to be elsewhere than Earth?
2670960	2676880	Impossible? Vanishingly, vanishingly small. In other words, the people that say it's guaranteed,
2676880	2683120	like Avi and Lee, and maybe you, I don't know, say it's all but guaranteed, the Fermi, you know,
2683120	2689280	kind of suggestion, it's all but guaranteed. So, what series of piece of evidence would decrease
2689280	2694800	that to as close to zero as you could imagine? You can't rule it out, obviously. Oh, you're
2694800	2699760	going to hate this answer. We would get to the next level in physics. We would find out that it
2699760	2704880	does give us the ability to buzz the cosmos. We would send out an enormous number of probes,
2705840	2713040	and we would change our, we would tutor our Bayesian prior by exploring all of the
2713840	2720480	most Earth-like exoplanets we could find, which are now cheap to visit because of new discoveries
2721280	2725920	that were not available to us when we were stuck with Einstein's effective theory,
2725920	2734400	or quantum field theory. That is what it would take. Right now, I can't see almost anything.
2734400	2738960	Really? I mean, I can't get you beyond sea, but I can get you to see, I can get you the speed of
2738960	2744320	light, right? We can have a discussion about the simulation hypothesis and that we can have avatars
2744320	2749040	cruising about the universe. We don't see any evidence of that either, in contrast to my guest,
2749040	2755040	David Shalmer's claim. So, I mean, we could travel at the speed of light. Isn't that good enough?
2757920	2761040	Do we really have to go beyond the speed of light before you believe that they don't exist?
2762000	2767280	You know, Brent, I don't know how to think about this. There's a suite of problems that is different
2767280	2772400	than any problem we've ever solved in science. One of them would be the beginning, how did life
2772400	2776800	begin? That would be an example of the class of problems I want to talk about, or another one of
2776800	2785600	these would be, how do you get consciousness to evolve from the material world? Another of these
2785680	2793920	would be contact or the ability to prove where did the origin of the universe, what is the origin
2793920	2802640	of the universe? What is behind the surface of last scattering? Why do men and women take so much
2803920	2808560	such different times when going to the restroom? You know, there are various things.
2809840	2813680	What? There's something man is not meant to know, literally. Exactly. That's what I was trying to say
2813680	2823840	with the surface of last scattering. I believe that we haven't solved any of these problems ever.
2825280	2832160	The hardest things that we know how to do, look, the hardest thing that I know is quantum field
2832160	2849840	theory. Quantum field theory is unbelievably difficult to learn, and it has gotten harder
2849840	2857600	and easier. Now, I have the entire standard model in stylized form that animates.
2857680	2865360	This is the classical input that when quantized gives us our understanding of the world, and it's
2865360	2872960	incredibly simple. The idea that this fits on a mug, and you and I can go line by line symbol
2872960	2882560	by symbol and say what everything is. Grand drinkification. We have only solved problems
2882560	2886800	in the shallow end of science. We have never solved a problem outside of the shallow end of
2886800	2895440	science. When people start to talk about free will, I just think, wow, you've gone from wearing floaties
2895440	2903360	in the shallow end with your parents holding you up to wanting to surf shark infested waters
2905360	2911840	off the coast of Portugal with monster waves and sharp rocks. Who knows what? It's a totally
2911840	2920000	different level of science to figure out life's origin or consciousness or the beginning of the
2920000	2926960	universe. We haven't gotten to any of these yet. I think what we're very good at is we're very good
2926960	2936960	at extremely hard, simple problems. We're all interested in these questions, but my interest
2936960	2943680	isn't in the recreational version of these. I know that if you and I did nothing else other than
2943680	2950400	talk about free will for a year, we would get nowhere. The conversation would be recreation.
2954240	2958000	I think we could have many different possible conversations. None of them will get anywhere.
2958640	2964240	So I'm always curious as to why people say, I believe in free will. I don't. Okay, so you're
2964240	2971280	going to do that thing. We need to do things that might work. And the things that might work have to
2971280	2979200	do with like my friend Rima Khan is about to have her SETI meeting in San Francisco. We can listen
2979200	2983920	for things. We can try to work on the laws of physics. I cannot believe we are still focused on
2983920	2990080	rockets, but very rich people seem to like rockets. If they have any idea of the danger we're in here
2990080	2997520	on earth, I think it's a completely bizarre feature of wealth and brilliance that brilliant,
2997520	3006720	smart people choose rockets. Don't know why. We've got to do something. And we've never solved any
3006720	3012320	of these problems. And I don't think we're going to get to these problems by pretending. I mean,
3012320	3018640	I always want when somebody talks to me about what life will be like to bring up cephalopods.
3019600	3024320	But I look at a cuttlefish, and I look at how intelligent a cuttlefish is, maybe not as smart
3024320	3032240	as an octopus. But a cuttlefish is such an alien creature. It's so far away from us on the phylogenetic
3032240	3038640	tree that it proves that you can't really easily anticipate what smart looks like.
3041040	3045440	And it's probably the reason that the heptapods were used in that movie. What is it? Arrival?
3046160	3055120	Yeah. And I think that the next physical theory is going to blow our minds. I think we've sat so
3055120	3061280	long pretending to have our minds blown by entanglement and Schrodinger's cat and the fact
3061280	3073840	that you get thinner and heavier in relativity theory, whatever, terrible paradox. That's not
3073840	3081280	really the mind blowing stuff. What's about to come, I think, is going to rewrite our knowledge
3081280	3089760	of ourselves just the way DNA did. So pitch me, I'm Elon. I can take $44 billion and put it
3089760	3100240	towards Twitter. I can scrap it or even make it $43 billion. What do you tell him? What should he do?
3100240	3105040	What would you do? He knows. I mean, what would I do? I mean, he's a physics major. He was a UPenn.
3105680	3110800	I mean, more than physics major, he's evidenced, I think, continuing interest in physics.
3111680	3119680	But he has hijacked the conversation of getting off the planet, which should be a conversation
3119680	3125680	about many, many, many, many, many, many different experiments rather than the moon and Mars.
3126000	3131920	And getting off with physics to being a conversation about rockets. So anytime you talk about diversifying
3131920	3139520	existential risk to humans, someone will now say, oh, don't worry, bro, Elon's going to get us to Mars
3140080	3147120	with those awesome, awesome rockets. It's like, I don't understand this. So I can't pitch Elon.
3147120	3152560	So would you go, I mean, but again, to push back with respect, as you know, I always do. And I
3153280	3160080	cheerfully recognize that I may have a huge blind spots myself. But it seems to me as if you're
3160080	3166320	going back to 1491 and you're telling, you know, Queen Ismerella or whoever. Don't fund this guy,
3166320	3173760	Chris. Chris C. Don't. He's just, wait, wait, wait. That doesn't make sense. We should do rockets.
3174400	3180000	Okay. We shouldn't obsess about rockets. Right. Not rockets only in the portfolio. But again,
3180080	3183200	let me just finish my torture analogy because it took me like a half an hour to make it up in
3183200	3188320	the shower this morning. But, you know, you're telling her, we should really fund this guy,
3188320	3194000	you know, Yitzhak Newton, or, you know, get these laws that will actually take us to the moon.
3194000	3199760	You know, let's just skip ahead boats, forget about these barks and, and, and boats. Let's
3199760	3205280	galleons. Let's skip ahead. I don't know that that would actually get us where we want to go.
3205280	3212160	Right. Because you're saying, you know, this, your priors are going to be informed by the either,
3212160	3216480	and a no-go theorem that says we can't go beyond Einstein. In which case, what would you say,
3216480	3222960	there are no aliens? If we couldn't go beyond Einstein, yeah, we're trapped in the world.
3222960	3228800	There's no, so like, this is another problem, which is, is that Einstein hijacked the conversation
3228800	3234240	so that now every time we talk, it's like, no, dude, we have time dilation, we have worm holes.
3234320	3243040	It's like, we have alcubierre drives. Blinding them. Oh, no, I thought you were making a crypto
3243040	3248240	enthusiast with laser eyes. That's right. Einstein with laser eyes. I told you. Okay.
3250080	3251840	Don't you? Okay. So,
3255360	3259840	I don't think Elon shouldn't do rockets. I think rockets is a profitable business. And I think
3259920	3265280	getting people excited about the future has to do with going back to the last moment when we actually,
3265280	3270480	as a country, you know, we didn't want to say, let's develop ICBMs that are really efficient in
3271440	3275760	hitting Beijing and Moscow. We said, we choose to go to the moon.
3278320	3287520	And, okay. So, you know, true enough. So go to the moon. But stop with the terraforming in Mars,
3288480	3297200	the light of human civilization. I just, you have to actually want to save us from ourselves right
3297200	3303920	now and talk about it in order to realize how completely crazy Elon has made everyone who
3303920	3311840	listens to him. Because at the moment, if you had Einstein and you had Elon, people would be gravitating
3311840	3321920	to Elon. He's charismatic. He's nailed in a world which is not comfortable with masculine traits.
3322480	3329920	He's highly chaotic. He's very entertaining. And people have this idea like, yo, dude,
3329920	3333760	he's the richest man in the world, bro. And that's the currency of our time.
3334480	3339840	So my feeling about this is everyone, Elon reaches with the story of terraforming Mars
3339840	3348640	with rockets and all this kind of stuff, thinks that's the plan. And I just think it's completely
3348640	3357120	crazy to get everything right and then go rockets terraforming Mars right at the end and just like,
3357840	3364160	dude, I just read this entire, you know, war and peace length novel and then in the last page, you
3364160	3370880	just do something completely bizarre. I just don't get it. Maybe I'm dumb. Maybe I don't,
3370880	3375200	I don't understand. I don't think it's Ferdinand and Isabella. I think that they, you know, we needed
3375200	3382160	to fund universities that studied natural philosophy and mathematics and physics. And we needed to
3382160	3387040	explore the world because we didn't know what was here. And we should go to Mars and we should go to
3387040	3392160	the moon. And we should have, if somebody said that our rocket allocation is stupid, we should
3392160	3397520	take it to zero, I would be fighting tooth and nail to make sure that rockets are budgeted.
3399200	3403280	Okay. The emphasis on rockets is psychotic.
3405920	3411760	It's like you're looking at a portfolio of a very, very rich person that's only in one municipal
3411760	3416880	bond or something. And you're like, make this make sense.
3417200	3424480	Yeah, he is. But then, of course, he is, you know, more diversified neurologically than almost
3424480	3429920	anybody. I'm just saying that he doesn't have the right to hijack the rock that the
3431280	3435840	we need to spread out and diversify because we're going to get ourselves killed on one planet with
3435840	3443680	a shared atmosphere. It's completely unreasonable for him. It's wonderful. I mean, I just, I have a
3443680	3448320	very clear idea that he's one of the smartest, most forward thinking people, and he's got a
3448320	3455280	rocket company and he's talking in some sense his book. Right. And he knows, look, I don't know him,
3456000	3460640	but I almost, I almost feel like I can guarantee you he knows better.
3463120	3468640	And so, you know, I don't want to speculate on what his strategy is, but he knows better than to
3468720	3473200	bet everything on Mars terraforming and the moon with rockets. Right.
3474080	3483840	Now, pivoting maybe slightly away, we look at, you know, what what we could do, you pointed to one
3483840	3489680	thing in there, you mentioned universities and how important they were. Now in 1492, the university
3489680	3496560	system was only about 400 years old at that point. And and it's it's aged since then and starting in
3496560	3504080	1080 or so in Bologna. And very little has changed. And I wonder, you know, the best and the brightest,
3504080	3509840	so to speak, what they might be getting sucked up into this orbit of Elon, no pun intended,
3509840	3514560	or this this kind of thinking or many other things crypto. But at least people like Michael
3514560	3520720	Saylor, who I had on the show last year, is very gracious and forward thinking as well.
3522080	3526400	You know, he started Saylor Academy. And that's sort of a university that only is going to produce
3526400	3532080	STEM majors, not going to produce, you know, gender studies majors, and it's not going to produce
3532080	3536640	things that are not related to pure science, technology, engineering and math, because he
3536640	3541680	believes that we need, you know, a million PhDs in these fields in order for us to progress. And
3541680	3547120	actually, I think the limiting factor for Elon is going to be humans. It's not going to be robots.
3547120	3552320	It's not going to be capital. It's going to be having enough people. And so the fault that I have
3552320	3557440	for him is that I don't see any and I'm not saying, Oh, give, you know, yesterday, a billion,
3557440	3562160	$100 million was given to Stanford University for sustainability. I'm not even saying Elon,
3562160	3566800	you know, hook, you see up Steve up with with the Musk Institute will churn out your P it because
3566800	3571280	I don't think I can do it either. Is that is there fundamental limitation for us getting off the
3571280	3576240	planet in your language, or becoming interplanetary in his language or transcending the laws of physics
3576240	3580640	in your language getting off the planetary species and his life? Is it humans? And is it
3580640	3585680	solvable? Because I can't just nuclear it as good as I am. I can't just nuclear it out of the vacuum
3585680	3593680	kids. Well, but okay, so let's look at the very weird question of anybody with a halfway interesting
3594880	3599520	version of a theory beyond the standard model. And I don't mean
3602800	3607600	sorry, I'm going to be very careful about the phrase. We have large programs,
3608560	3613280	grand unification, supersymmetry, technicolor, super strings, etc.
3615920	3622560	These are the big programs. More or less, if you're not on a big program, I know of almost no one
3622560	3633040	inside the university system, who's got a truly interesting audacious idea for what to do next.
3634000	3641440	I could tell you that, you know, Peter Wojt, for example, has moved from being a curmudgeon
3642080	3647520	to actually saying this I believe, which is fascinating. I mean, imagine if Sabina Hossenfelder,
3648560	3654240	instead of complaining about the gobbledygook or the fact that people are actually, you know,
3654240	3661040	and she's quite accurate, I think, about this overselling things that don't work. But I really
3661040	3667760	love that Peter moved towards saying this is what I think may be generating all of this.
3669040	3674800	He's there in a nontraditional role inside of the math department of Columbia University. He's
3674800	3682080	writing books, he's writing papers, he's giving talks, but he's not a professor. Same thing with,
3682080	3687680	you know, David Deutch has a really weird situation at Oxford. Garrett Lisey has a very
3687680	3693440	weird situation wherever he is. Julian Barbour has a weird situation. Stephen Wolfram.
3695360	3702960	Inside the universities, we've turned it into the Hunger Games academically, and so everyone
3702960	3706960	is worried about survival and nobody's actually worried about physics because they're worried
3706960	3712480	about personal survival, they're not worried about general survival. I think what you have to look at
3712480	3717440	is that there is a reluctance. I mean, one of the things I say that doesn't win me a ton of
3717440	3726080	friends is that it appears that nobody actually has any money. And the reason that I say that is
3726080	3735200	that all sorts of, it feels to me like nobody, we have, there were Rockefellers. They built
3735200	3741040	Rockefeller University and the University of Chicago, one of our absolute jewels. You know,
3741040	3745680	Vanderbilt, there's a Vanderbilt University, Carnegie had money, there's a Carnegie,
3746320	3754800	Leyland Stanford, we don't want to invest anymore in this stuff. There's a general anti-science
3754800	3760240	thing partially, I think, fueled by the fact that when Anthony Fauci says, I am the science, trust
3760240	3772480	the science, we are revulsed, we recoil in war, maybe I should say it that way. And I think people
3772480	3781600	who have money are turning away from universities because those containers are seemingly very
3781600	3790640	susceptible to revolutionary nonsense. And so why would you build a container and then put great
3790640	3798000	stuff in it only to have it instantly corrupted by the associate dean of niceness goodness and
3798000	3806800	fluffy puppy dogs for pediatric oncology patients? You know, it's like, okay, we need to help kids
3806800	3814000	who are facing cancer, we need, I have a dog, I like good things, ice cream, blah, blah, blah, blah.
3814880	3821280	But the university is attesting to their own fundamental goodness at every turn and denouncing
3821280	3829760	everyone who disagrees with them as Genghis Khan Hitler or Lizzie Borden or whatever. It's not a
3829760	3839200	very appealing pitch to people with resources. So what I'm seeing is that more or less people
3839200	3846720	with incredible resources don't want to spend on things that are important. They've been tinged
3846720	3866080	with this kind of failure and greediness. And I think one of the things we need to do is if the
3866080	3872480	government is just going to renege on the endless frontier compact between the universities and
3872480	3878960	the federal government, I don't want to be in a intellectual property category where we can't
3878960	3885200	monetize what we discover. I just want to take you by your ankles and say, God damn it, you fooled us,
3885200	3889680	give us all our money back that we generated for you. We built the entire economy and you treat us
3890480	3896800	like we're your servants, you're making me sick to my stomach. For God's sakes, grow a pair and
3896800	3901520	recognize you've got the world's greatest deal and that these people basically have integrity and
3901520	3906960	you're turning their lives upside down into a horror where people don't want to go into their
3906960	3913760	offices and universities. When I was just touring universities on the East Coast, professors would
3913760	3918240	close their doors and in hushed tones, they would say, I can't really say this outside, but things
3918240	3922960	have gotten really crazy here. And I'm thinking, you're the owners of the university. No matter
3922960	3928080	what anyone tells you, you don't want to send your kid to a university that isn't run effectively by
3928080	3933600	its professors. Universities are not primarily about teaching. You should go to a college if
3933600	3938960	you're focused on teaching. Universities are about research. The research is done by professors
3939600	3946560	and by far the most important research is done in STEM. I mean, I think there's very important
3946560	3951360	research that's been done in folklore, ethnomusicology was something I considered going into.
3952160	3958640	There's plenty of things that can be researched that aren't STEM. But the most important things we
3958640	3965280	do is to better understand the world in which we live, gain power and wisdom to control it.
3966240	3971840	And if the humanities aren't going to be giving us wisdom, but are going to be giving us negative
3971840	3978240	wisdom, it's very important that anybody with hate in their heart who talks about anti-racism all
3978240	3983920	day long, which is just another name for racism, should not be informing people who might have to
3983920	3991280	make nuclear weapons or fuel air explosives or any one of the horrible things that we may need to
3991280	3998800	keep ourselves safe. It's very important to keep lunatics away from the stuff that actually works.
3998800	4010160	And I mean, I've always agreed with you in general terms, but I do feel like we have kind of an
4010160	4018480	opportunity that is only kind of full of latency when it's thought prospectively in the future.
4018480	4026160	In other words, the inventor of the laser, Charlie Towns or the inventor of GPS and
4026160	4032720	things like that or Einstein, these people died, you know, not wealthy people. And yet,
4032720	4039120	if they had attempted, and yet the creator of Ethernet, you know, the three-com, you know,
4039120	4040160	is currently a triple-
4040160	4041680	What terms, Brian?
4041680	4045760	Wealthy financially. So we can define wealth other ways, obviously.
4045760	4051280	But let's pause that just for one second. I'm going to disagree in very strong terms.
4051680	4057280	I went into academics in large measure for freedom.
4059920	4062960	And that's why people go into business for freedom.
4064480	4069280	I think that if you priced the freedom that somebody like Noam Chomsky enjoyed,
4070080	4075680	you know, probably had his pension taken care of, probably was made an institute professor at MIT,
4075680	4082400	could draw off on any topic. He had this giant army behind him that would stand up for his freedom
4082400	4090480	of expression and freedom of inquiry. The functional equivalent of Noam Chomsky's wealth was absolutely
4090480	4091520	enormous.
4091520	4096320	Oh, sure. I'm not debating that. And you can have, by the way, you can have both. Elon, you know,
4096320	4100480	dictates you can have both. You can have intellectual capital as well. But I'm thinking purely
4100480	4106720	for the translation ability of wealth to then be used to research purposes. So you made the argument
4106720	4111680	that we should have taxed, you know, semiconductor instructions or emails, all of which are invented
4111680	4112880	by physicists or appliances.
4112880	4116800	No, we shouldn't have done that. We should have kept our agreements. But if you're going to be a
4116800	4123120	prick about it, by all means, you're basically taking everything that was developed by people
4123120	4130160	that you've now treated as your servants, who you've actually legally hobbled. And my feeling
4130160	4134080	about this is that's completely unethical.
4134080	4140240	100%. All I'm saying is that the biggest lie in finance is that past performance isn't indicative
4140240	4146480	of future, you know, returns. I mean, look at, look at whatever, pick whatever pre.com company
4146480	4151680	you like. So all I'm saying is that given that academia and academicians like the ones that
4151680	4155440	you mentioned have been treated like garbage and that physicists have not been able to not
4155440	4160080	monetize for our selfish own internal purposes, which I believe we deserve. But I'm not going
4160080	4166000	to talk about that for the purpose of physics for the greater glory of physics. I claim we need
4166000	4171200	to start with an educational campaign now. In other words, we say the next project that's going
4171200	4176400	to be developed with quantum computing or before it's monetized, and we lose the rights to say,
4176400	4181600	hold on, I didn't sign off on this IP, we need to be smart. And I don't think there's any training
4181760	4184960	you know, certainly I'm guilty. I don't train my graduates since I'm blessed to have so many
4184960	4188800	brilliant kids. I never sit down. So if you ever get into a situation, I have two patents, by the
4188800	4192480	way. I never sit down and say like, if I'm ever in the situation where this thing could make,
4192480	4197280	you know, millions of like, here's what I should do in order to benefit. But I think we need something.
4197280	4201520	It's it should be in some way incorporated into our education. And I think the best way to do that
4201520	4207200	ironically is through the humanities show through history of physics as you know better than anybody.
4207200	4210880	Although I always say it's if you want to if you want to damn somebody with fake praise and as a
4210880	4216080	scientist, he's really knowledgeable about the history of physics, you know, it's like, it's
4216080	4220720	such a backhanded compliment. But you do in all honesty, and all seriousness, you do understand
4220720	4226560	it. Let me get back on that because that's kind of a dig. My feeling about this is you don't need
4226560	4233040	to know the history of physics if you want to do relatively workman like scientific research.
4233840	4238240	The only people who really need to understand the history of physics aren't most physicists. It's
4238240	4243920	the tiny number of people who are going to do things like break new ground. So it's really
4243920	4248880	important not to sell the history of physics to everybody, you can become a calculation monkey
4249760	4255520	and go to any calculation monkey school and do calculation monkey equations. That's fine.
4256160	4262080	The really hard thing is to try to figure out how did people break out of cognitive prisons?
4263040	4268640	And so, you know, some of the funniest things is when people have these insults,
4269360	4274400	like the one you just said, it's like, well, yeah, because you didn't understand what it was
4274400	4281120	about to begin with. Yeah, I agree. I guess all I'm saying is wouldn't it be great to have education
4281760	4288000	so that the next time we invent the internet, you know, hypertext protocols, that we can think
4288000	4292400	for a second now, how do we do this? How do we renegotiate the contract? That's what I want to
4292400	4297760	say. You're a very astute, you've picked up on the problem, but we can't go back and rectify the
4297760	4302400	past performance, but we can say, given the way that the history of the field is gone, you want to
4302400	4309760	invent the quantum, you know, Bose-Einstein condensate laser that will be used for God knows what,
4311280	4315760	before you do that, we should have an honest conversation about our crisper or whatever.
4315760	4324080	Well, where are the mega fortunes that are interested in this stuff? And my claim is,
4325360	4330800	you know, we both talked to Jim Simons. Jim knows how important this stuff is, and he's put a fair
4330800	4337920	amount of capital behind this. In my, you know, at some point, I had a conversation with him
4339440	4343920	about fixing education. And he said, I spent a fair amount of time on it. And the only thing
4343920	4347760	that actually seemed to make sense is to take terrible teachers and make them slightly less
4347760	4354720	terrible. And it was just, it was a heartbreaking thing. So I've seen people plow money into some
4354720	4364160	of these things and get very little back. The things that work can't be said very easily right
4364160	4370400	now because they're out of keeping with the ethos of our time. You meet people, how do you know
4370480	4379120	who's good? Because you talk to them. You find out whether they have 12 ideas before
4380160	4386000	they have a cup of coffee and three of them are good, you know, three good ideas. That's
4386000	4396000	astounding. It's hard to have good ideas. We basically know who's good. And we don't get to
4396000	4403040	dial their facial characteristics or look at their chromosomes or whatever. You know, good is good.
4405040	4413200	Famously, Ramanujan was, you know, sent a letter to Hardy and Hardy and Little would read it in
4413200	4420400	Cambridge and they said, well, either he's a humbug or a genius. And we guessed genius because
4420400	4428640	humbugs are relatively rare. Beautiful one. We know who's good. We know who to fund and we
4428640	4433360	know how to leave people alone and nobody wants to do it. Everybody wants to say, oh, it's all in
4433360	4439760	the ethos and the myth of the lone individual and, you know, this is so elitist, all this kind of
4439760	4445280	nonsense. Okay, well, I don't know how to tell you this, but you're just, you're wrong 12,000 ways
4445280	4451440	from Sunday. And you're going to destroy everything that we know how to do. Many of the people who
4451440	4458400	make real breakthroughs are very difficult to deal with. And if you don't want to deal with people
4458400	4464320	who are difficult to deal with, you can just sort of write off most progress. Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't
4464320	4472320	leave Feynman alone with my daughter or your daughter. But but he sure knew his way. That's
4472320	4476960	true because we don't want Feynman maced or kicked in the groin because he's a valuable human.
4477840	4482960	And our kids are skilled in the deadly arts of the groin attack from Krav Maga training that we
4482960	4489440	give them. And that is a mitzvah for all of you. Yes, exactly. So we're talking with Eric Weinstein,
4489440	4495520	proprietor of the portal podcast, among the other things. You can find Eric at Eric R Weinstein
4495520	4502240	at both Twitter and on Instagram. He has a website. It was about a year ago, we had a conversation
4502240	4508640	about geometric unity. And I want to talk about that. Because it's still it's still it haunts
4508640	4515040	my dreams. It's still something that's very delightful. And and it represents a sort of a
4515040	4521120	sort of, you know, candle in the darkness, a sort of hope, a scream in the void, thinking big things.
4521120	4526640	Obviously, it's not, you know, there are people that have, as you mentioned, Peter Boyd, Garrett
4526640	4533680	Leasy, there, there are a surf fight of other contender theories that have their own lacunae.
4533680	4538800	But where, where, where are you now with with geometric unity? Where is the project at this
4538800	4545520	point? Well, I'm talking to a lot more different physicists. And who have you met with most recently
4545520	4550160	that's most exciting for you, besides present company, obviously. Well, I mean, I don't want to
4550160	4555200	get into details, but I think probably one of the best conversations I had recently might have been
4555200	4564800	with Nima, Arkani Hamed. There's a local graduate student, I'm going to mention his name, because
4564800	4572960	he deserves it. And what is the name to watch Trevor Schopener at UCLA is an unbelievable
4572960	4581120	up and coming guy in things V burns group. But I've been, you know, talking with Avi about
4581200	4587840	astrophysics, discussed with Alan Gooth recently, some aspects of
4589840	4598560	how multiple generations are generated. Just a fairly colleagues in France.
4601360	4607120	I've been, I've been very lucky to have access to great people. And I think that one of the things
4607120	4617520	that's happened is that with supersymmetry, and with string theory, not being able to
4620720	4624480	find something that really shows us that they're on the right track.
4627440	4636320	People are slowly open to the idea of either shutting high energy, fundamental physics down,
4636400	4642480	and it's going to be up in arms about that. There's like a huge move to move towards
4643120	4648160	quantum computation. You say, why is that? It's like, oh, well, because computers have
4648160	4653360	been really important. And so the metaphor of the universe as a computer is really important.
4655360	4662240	Information, maybe we can rebase everything around information. It's something you can do, you can try.
4663200	4668160	But I think right at the moment, where we are is that
4673680	4682480	we realize that the Baby Boomer program has run its course. The Baby Boomer program was strings.
4683280	4692720	Almost all of the people in string theory came up. They viewed the world a particular way. They
4692720	4700640	changed the problems that we thought of as fundamental. Quantizing gravity became the
4702000	4710480	problem to work on, which I think was absolutely wrong. And what we find ourselves in is a world in
4710480	4716640	which the old thing that was crowding out everything else is in the process of dying,
4716640	4721200	and that is string fundamentalism. And one of the great things about talking to Nima
4722800	4730960	was, for me, that Nima is not captured by strings, but he's animated by strings,
4730960	4737120	which is exactly the right position to be in, which is that you're not 100% sure that strings
4737360	4741280	are the right direction to go. But you can say, look at all of the things that string theory
4741280	4750480	accomplishes inside of quantum field theory. It gives us paradigmatic ways in which we can elude
4750480	4756880	certain seemingly no-go theorems and the like, or it's taught us a lot. And I think that the toy
4756880	4762800	theories that really came along with the string guys, because the string guys are mostly guys,
4763600	4774400	not 100%, but too much, more or less used a lot of toy quantum field theories to explore some of
4774400	4780640	these ideas. That was a second program. That was very good, by the way, on their part for developing
4780640	4785360	quantum field theory as a discipline, but it's been a disaster for uncovering new physical
4785360	4792160	law and new physical explanations. So I do think that right at the moment, people would be open,
4792240	4797680	but there's no, we should be building accelerators. We should be getting people,
4797680	4802880	here's the crazy thing, Brian. I'm dancing around it and trying not to say it, but maybe I'll just
4802880	4810560	say it. We just had this W mass announcement. The W particle appears to be much heavier,
4811280	4817360	and by much, I don't mean like three times as heavy, but I mean by an appreciable amount,
4817360	4823680	heavier than we thought. And I watch everyone's explanations of this to the public,
4824400	4829120	and I haven't seen one that really sounds to me like what this thing actually is.
4829920	4836640	We settle on these, here's how we talk to the public about the W message. Well, what is the
4836640	4844560	W particle? It's more or less a part of a derivative from calculus. And what does a derivative want
4844560	4850480	to do? It wants to differentiate functions. Well, what functions does it have? Well, it can
4850480	4857200	differentiate something called a Higgs field. Now, if you look at this mug, for example, and I'm not
4857200	4864320	good at going around. Drinking and deriving. Drinking and deriving. That term right there,
4864320	4876480	which probably looks like d sub mu of phi norm squared. That term is where the W particle interacts
4876480	4881520	with the Higgs particle. So you're effectively using the W particle to differentiate a Higgs
4881520	4889360	particle just the way you use the photon to differentiate an electron. That process by which
4889360	4898320	the Higgs particle gives mass to a small number of pieces of a derivative, the W and Z particles.
4898320	4906480	It gives mass in some sense to itself. You've got this potential term here. You've got Yukawa terms
4906480	4915280	here where it's giving mass the same phi is occurring here. All of, sorry, not hold that up. So this
4915360	4920960	is where the W particle is getting mass. This is where the Higgs is getting mass from itself
4920960	4930240	through its interaction with the Mexican hat potential, the sombrero. The Yukawa term where the
4930240	4936640	fermions, the electrons and protons get mass. That whole system isn't explained to anybody in the
4936640	4943920	public, which is criminal. And then I've sort of been in this kind of self-examination phase,
4943920	4948880	which is, oh, Eric, you use so many big words. Why can't we understand you? I was like, well,
4949840	4953200	one thing is almost nobody's actually trying to tell you what's really going on.
4954240	4958640	And when I sit there and I say, okay, the W particle is part of a derivative,
4959840	4965200	all my colleagues know what I'm saying. But they're not venturing out there to say
4965200	4970080	something so simple. And I don't know why they're not doing it. So the public isn't animated.
4971040	4978160	Like, the fact is, this mug, if you had this mug in your house and you said,
4979280	4981840	more or less, everything other than gravity is on that mug,
4984880	4989040	somebody would want to know, one person in your family, like, well, how do I read it?
4989040	4995440	What does it mean? What are the different terms? Do they have names? Nobody is talking to the public
4996400	5003360	about what it is that we do. And that's how I get into trouble. I say, hey, I have an
5003360	5008560	explanation for why there are three generations of matter. I don't even know that's a problem.
5010400	5015760	So if you think about the sort of things that GU is doing different than, let's say, Garrett or
5015760	5021760	Peter White, one of the things I think that's exciting is that a good theory should probably
5021840	5028000	tell the standard model and general relativity what it got wrong. And I don't think anybody
5028000	5032160	inside of the academic system wants to do that. They want to extend only.
5033280	5038080	You know, and this is why, for example, everybody will add sterile neutrinos to the standard model,
5038080	5041600	because it's like, it's the least offensive thing that won't screw anything up.
5043040	5048640	So I've been thinking a lot about this, which is why do why do none of us talk to the public
5048720	5054000	in real terms? Why do we allow Feynman's dumbest statements to characterize
5055040	5059440	what seems to be the height of sophistication? If you can't explain it to your grandma, it means
5059440	5064720	you don't understand it. If I can't create the word world myself, then I'm useless. It's like,
5064720	5071040	okay, well, it's a lot of machismo, but it's not very smart. And in those
5073840	5078400	opportunities, none of us are really filling it in. We're not talking about what the W particle is.
5078400	5081920	We're not talking about why it's important. We're not talking about why this is so exciting.
5081920	5086880	I can hardly sleep. I don't even know that it's real. Maybe it may be wrong.
5087920	5091840	Well, we know things are real. We know calculus is real. And let's start with a,
5091840	5096080	you know, when I learned calculus, I had a self teach it to myself, because I actually wasn't
5096080	5101440	placed along a math track that would have taken me to take the APs. And I had to kind of self
5101440	5105360	motivate. And that came because of the love of astronomy that I wanted to find out, well,
5105360	5109680	how do we know these galaxies are moving away? How do we know Haley's comets orbit and all sorts
5109680	5114320	of things that were going on at the time when I was a, you know, preteen? And so I had to teach
5114320	5119680	it myself. But once I learned it, I kind of felt like I had, you know, gotten the cheat code, you
5119680	5124320	know, just I started to see things in a different way. And I went through the portal. And at that
5124320	5130000	moment, I felt a great gift had been given to me. And it was given by myself. But in the sense that
5130000	5134480	I was given these gifts from the great people that came before me, including my hero, Gale,
5135280	5139840	Gale, who I want to talk about, because I have exciting news about a wonderful project that
5139840	5145760	I've been blessed to work on the last couple of years now, and it's come to fruition. But I feel
5145760	5149840	like we're doing a disservice. That's why I say, I kind of joke in the past, but I'm getting more
5149840	5154880	and more serious. I feel the scientists like me, especially like me, who get paid by the public,
5155680	5163040	have a moral obligation to teach the most exciting and most delightful, delicious developments
5163120	5168160	to the public for free. And they should do that as part of their as part of their job, quote,
5168800	5172800	and they'll say, I'm not good at it. And to which I'll say, oh, yeah, I forgot, when you were born,
5172800	5175840	you knew quantum field theory. Oh, no, no, I had to learn that it was very hard. And it's very
5175840	5180480	sophisticated. Okay, so you spend time on things you think are valuable, right, my fellow professors.
5180480	5185280	And it doesn't make me popular around the faculty club. But I do believe that, you know, especially,
5185280	5190240	but in every professor, every scientist is supported by the public at some level or another.
5190240	5194400	So, you know, we have a we have a huge we have a branding problem, we talked about the marketing
5194400	5202320	problem. But we also have kind of a an education and a self obligation that scientists don't feel,
5202320	5206080	we feel like we can sit around be the be the equation monkeys that you were talking about
5206080	5212320	before. It's not true, Brian. I just, I mean, disagree with this. Here's the basic problem,
5212320	5216240	because I've gone through this now. Let's imagine you want to understand what the W
5216240	5221520	particle is in the Higgs particle and why this matters, right? So there's some safe thing that
5221520	5228000	everyone can say, and then you can try to actually be real, and then get attacked. So I don't like
5228000	5234080	being attacked. It's, I've got idiots who follow me around who call up my colleagues and try to
5234080	5241680	alienate everyone for me. And my feeling about these people is, once you understand what the
5241680	5249120	cost is, you understand why nobody does it. But here's a cord, okay? This cord represents a function.
5250160	5257440	The height of the cord is a function. And the W particle is in part a level.
5259440	5266720	And that level could be horizontal. Or we could use the level to define what is horizontal.
5266720	5273360	Right? And so if I pick this, we all know that the derivative is the rise over run above that level.
5274560	5280640	But if I say, you know what, I have fiat power, and I'm going to decide that not this, but this
5280640	5286080	is level, then the cord that is tangent at that point is actually constant, even though it appears
5286080	5294880	to be rising. Okay? Now, I didn't use any big words. You're watching the con Eric showing off
5294880	5299440	Eric is doing this. In the comments, people are saying, Eric, please read a book about this.
5300080	5306480	Well, some, most of them, but my point is a tiny number of people who are terrible and who just
5306480	5312640	don't want good things to happen, don't want us to try and fumble in front of the public.
5314960	5319360	And they don't want us to succeed because then we get large follower counts. And it's like, well,
5319360	5324960	why is that guy the most, you know, followed mathematician on Twitter? It's like, that should
5324960	5330320	be me. Okay, maybe it should be you. I'll tell you the one thing, if you really have enemies,
5330320	5337440	wish them fame, I promise you, they want it. You don't want it. It's a great deal.
5339520	5346320	What we need to do is to be more courageous about saying, look, you're not going to understand
5346320	5350240	quantum field theory, but here's some things you can break out. If you can keep up with the
5350240	5355920	Kardashian, you can, you can keep up with quarks, you can keep up with hadrons and leptons. There
5355920	5361440	aren't so many, there aren't so many hadrons and leptons that you can't learn them all in an afternoon.
5362720	5366560	Right? They're probably about as many fundamental particles as there are Kardashians.
5368080	5373680	And the idea that we don't talk about this, we don't traffic in it, we're not excited about this.
5373920	5381920	Think about 90 years ago, this is the 90th year anniversary of the neutron. We didn't
5381920	5388000	know that there were neutrons. So my aunt, who is in her late 90s, grew up before there were
5388000	5392480	neutrons. So when she was a very little girl, nobody knew what a neutron was. Almost immediately
5392480	5397600	after the discovery of neutrons, we get chain reactions. We get atomic weapons and atomic power.
5397600	5408160	That discovery within living memory made the world a completely different place.
5408160	5414720	And watch out for what comes next. As an adaptation of the old saying, you may not be
5414720	5423120	interested in physics, but boy is physics going to be interested in it. And the idea that you're
5423120	5429840	not part of the conversation, which is who are we, what is this place and can we go and look at
5429840	5439840	the night sky and dream responsibly without wormholes and without sci-fi of visiting. If that
5439840	5445680	doesn't animate you, I guarantee you, you probably can't find a Jimi Hendrix guitar solo that moves
5445680	5450960	you either. And that brings up the other chords that you're capable of bringing out and show your
5450960	5455680	guitar. We're going to get that at the very end. So people in the chat room are saying things that
5455680	5463040	Kim Kardashian actually has a nice set of bosons. That's kind of cool to know. But Eric, if actually
5463040	5470000	listeners and viewers, 800 people watching right now, if you'd like Eric to write a book about this,
5470640	5476400	give a thumbs up to this video, and we'll see if we can create the groundswell necessary
5476400	5482080	to do this labor of love, which is writing a book. And I've actually just produced my third
5482640	5488720	book, and I can't believe it, three books in four years. This one I didn't write. So this one I had
5488720	5494560	a ghost writer, literally, and the name of the ghost writer. Are we on the verge of a major
5494560	5500240	announcement, which I don't even know? You don't know it. It is a major announcement, at least in
5500240	5505520	my life. I've been putting it out on Twitter here and there. But now I want to come clean and really
5505520	5515520	announce it for all time. And that is 390 years ago. So 300 years before the neutron. A man by
5515520	5521680	the name of Galileo Galilei wrote a book that got him in a tiny bit of hot water. He was kind of the
5521680	5527680	Weinstein of his day, not afraid to be provocative in some ways, take liberties and take a license.
5527680	5531440	And he wrote a book called The Dialogue. And this book, it was in Italian, it was called The
5531440	5537280	Dialogue. And it was in contradistinction to his first book called The Ciderius Nuncius. Ciderius
5537280	5543120	Nuncius, as you all know, is Latin for starry messenger, and he was allowed to keep publishing
5543120	5547360	in Latin because nobody spoke Latin. And so it wasn't a threat to the Catholic Church.
5548080	5552640	But after he used the spyglass, as he called it, the perspective tube, the telescope,
5553440	5559120	he found that he could not really get over the overwhelming evidence that was presented to him,
5559120	5563520	and he wanted to share it for the world with the notion that the universe is not centered on the
5563520	5569600	earth, it's centered on the sun. And so he was advancing Copernicus theory and other earlier
5569600	5573760	theories as well. And he wrote this wonderful book. It's called The Dialogue. It's actually a
5573760	5580160	trial log between three characters, one of whom is modeled after Galileo himself. And he gave
5580160	5586560	this character the name Salviati, the salvation. And then the other one was modeled after the
5586560	5591600	Pope, Pope Urban, and his arguments. And he put his arguments in the name of a character named
5591600	5598720	Simplicio, the simpleton. I love this because it shows that even the most biggest geniuses in
5598720	5604880	academia can have huge fatal flaws in their impolitic behavior. And then there's a third
5604880	5610880	character who's an intelligent layperson. His name is Sagredo. So I got the most famous two Italians
5610880	5618720	that I know, Carlo Revelli and Fabiola Gianatti, who you love for her use of comic sans. And so
5619520	5625600	we at the Higgs-Boson announcement. So we should say that one of them is a famous theorist. It's
5625600	5636880	attached to Luke quantum gravity. The other one is a big shot physicist with the CERN experiment.
5636880	5642560	Yeah, the director of CERN, which is where the LHC is located and responsible for discovery of
5642560	5648960	the Higgs-Boson. So we and along with Jim Gates, who's another friend of yours, a professor at
5648960	5653360	the Ford Foundation, professor at Brown University, where I will be returning. And that's stay tuned
5653360	5659520	for a top secret announcement at the end of this month. I have great respect for him and I've
5659520	5666960	enjoyed meeting him, but we are not close. So the five or six of us put together a audio book,
5666960	5673120	the first ever audio book by Galileo. So it exists and you can get it wherever books or audio
5673120	5679040	bowl lies, including Amazon, Audible, Google Play, wherever you like. I'll put a link to it in the
5679040	5683680	show notes below. And it was really a labor of love. It took us a year to record it, edit it,
5684320	5690320	and our home studios are around the world in Italy. Carlo was in Italy and in Aix and Provence,
5690320	5693680	or however you pronounce that. And then my friend Lucio Picharillo is the third character.
5694240	5700080	We recorded it. And so much of what comes through in this wonderful book is just beyond
5701040	5705280	my comprehension as a physicist. And actually, Frank Wilczek, I should say,
5705280	5712080	narrated the Nobel Prize winner 2004 Nobel Prize winner for Asymptotic Freedom.
5712800	5718720	He narrated the dedication by Albert Einstein, the forward to the book by Galileo, in which
5718720	5722640	he calls this book by Galileo the most important book ever written.
5723120	5725360	Einstein called Galileo's book.
5725360	5730480	Yes, Einstein called the dialogue the most, not just science book, but really the most important
5730480	5736080	book that had really ever been written, fiction, nonfiction, however you like to say it, including
5736080	5741920	his own work. So it was incredibly gratifying to have these people come together and do it.
5742480	5746480	And of course, this book is Italian, and it was written originally in Italian,
5746480	5753280	and we had to have it translated. And so anyway, I started off doing it really kind of as a kind
5753280	5758320	of a lark. But then I decided that there could be some spin off opportunities, not really just for
5758320	5763520	me, but I think maybe for physics, and I want to get your impression on. So one thing about this
5763520	5768560	book, they're extremely expensive to get your hands on a original copy of the dialogue, 390-year-old
5768560	5774640	books are very rare, obviously. So I decided I have a collector friend who allowed me to scan
5774640	5780320	pictures from it, and we're making NFTs of it. And at first, I thought it was kind of silly,
5780320	5785440	kind of crazy, why would you make an NFT of a physical product or whatever. But the more I
5785440	5791440	thought about it, like, what if we could do use blockchain technology and science, not just for
5791440	5795600	preserving or maybe maybe we could make a DAO, one of these organizations, these entities to buy
5795680	5801760	these books before they get lost or stolen or whatever, a couple hundred thousand dollars to
5801760	5808720	get an original one. But what if we could either custodize it or if we could use it to generate
5809440	5814400	resources for physics. So I want to run that idea by you, not specifically with my Galileo project,
5815120	5821040	but that's just kind of my testing the water with NFTs, but you can find that on my website,
5821120	5828000	BrianKating.com. But for a fraction of an ether, but what do you think about NFTs and science?
5828000	5831680	What do you think about the prospects for using this blockchain technology?
5831680	5839200	By any means necessary is where I am at the moment. Malcolm X, I think, was correct that
5839200	5845360	we needed to, there's certain things that are just so important that I almost don't care how
5845360	5854720	they happen. My hope is that NFTs don't backfire on us because the right thing to do is to make
5855600	5863520	very serious people very rich in autonomy so that they never think about, you know, look,
5865120	5870320	making somebody a low eight-digit millionaire, double-digit millionaire,
5870320	5877280	is probably sufficient to give them an extremely nice life. And there are tons of those
5877920	5884560	who do far less for us than the people who do our molecular biology, chemistry,
5884560	5891200	mathematics, and physics. So I do think that it's important if we're going to abandon all of our
5891200	5895600	culture, we're going to leak everything, we're going to turn the universities into cesspools,
5895600	5901520	et cetera, et cetera. We've got to get a few money to the people who built everything for us,
5901520	5909680	in my opinion. What I don't want to see is I don't want to see it backfiring.
5909680	5912880	I don't want to see a claim, oh, well, you guys have your NFTs, so you're good now.
5913440	5920880	It's like, no. We're scrambling because you screwed us over and you're idiots,
5920880	5927920	and it's time for you to be ethical and smart. That's a very hard conversation to have.
5929360	5936480	If we have to dramatize it by NFTs, so be it. But my feeling is, what if the NFT thing goes
5936480	5942000	in different directions? If it goes through to the moon, then it's a great move. What if it goes
5942000	5948240	in the toilet? And now we've sort of staked our credibility on getting involved in something that
5948240	5956640	has a Ponzi scheme built into it. I'm not saying it is a Ponzi scheme. There is Ponzi in NFT,
5956640	5963440	just as there is Genius in NFT. I also want to point out that the concept of digital scarcity,
5963440	5969280	if you go back to the original blockchain white paper of Satoshi, it's very, very clear that
5969280	5976560	it's propagating something according to a conservation law, that you hand me your public key,
5976560	5983040	and I've got my private key, and I've got this token that I'm laying claim to. I can propagate
5983040	5992880	my token to you in this infinite chain of custody by virtue of the fact that something is conserved.
5992880	6001040	Now, of course, you had to create new tokens out of the vacuum. But my belief is, is that one of
6001040	6005680	the things is we should be talking about this in terms of digital conservation laws and digital
6005680	6015280	physics, and we should be active. And I also think that having been playing with the crypto
6015280	6019520	community a little bit, at first, they dismiss everybody because they think you come in from
6019520	6025520	outside and you don't care about anything. You just want to tell people things. But we do know
6025520	6031840	that there's a lot of homology between Bitcoin and gauge theory,
6032800	6038880	conservation principles. Conservation principles have to do with symmetry. I am sure that if you
6038880	6044880	and I got roaring drunk for two weeks with a whiteboard, we would come up with a symmetry principle
6045520	6051520	for Bitcoin using some version of a discretized nerder's theorem that took the conservation law
6051520	6056160	that allows us to propagate, you know, Satoshi's solution of the double spend problem
6056960	6067040	is probably worthy of some amazing science prize. It's just an ingenious idea. And it's hard to
6067040	6074160	understand what is the substrate of, is it the idea that the individual wallets, the public-private
6074160	6081520	key pairs, is it computers and nodes? Because the interesting thing is that it was engineered
6081600	6087200	so that nodes could go dark. And, you know, that's like taking a chunk of space time out of commission.
6088960	6097040	I think it's really important that physics get involved with NFTs, with conservation laws,
6097040	6103280	with digital physics, and actually contribute into the system to make it much more useful.
6104000	6107920	And while some in the crypto community will say, oh, they're just talking their book and
6108720	6112720	to a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail, you know, to a man with a gauge theory,
6112720	6119280	everything looks like a conservation law. Just ignore those people. There are so many good people
6119280	6124640	in crypto who are interested in any interesting idea. We need to party with them. That's my thought.
6126080	6131760	So I want to ask you to look into your crystal ball, and maybe we'll do the the lightening
6131760	6140560	round as we like to do, Eric. Are we done with COVID? No. Explain.
6143360	6147680	My feeling about this is that probably COVID is much worse than we thought,
6148640	6153200	or that we understand, and that people who understood it were protecting us against something.
6153200	6158800	I don't know this to be true, but if I had to make a guess. The reason that China is so ferocious
6158800	6163280	about trying to stamp COVID out, is that I worry that they know something, that it's not a flu,
6163280	6170240	that it's a cumulative flu that destroys you, bout by bout. I don't know what this thing is,
6170240	6176480	and I think it's it's criminal that we're so far into this. And we have no idea why China is behaving
6176480	6182160	the way it's behaving, or why Fauci behaves the way he behaves, or Peter Dajik, or Ralph Barrick,
6182160	6187760	or any of these people. Somehow this COVID is taking place outside of science.
6189040	6197680	And it's, I'm worried that we don't understand what COVID is, and we don't know which wave is
6197680	6203600	going to is going to hurt and how bad it. I mean, no, I don't think so. I think that
6203600	6210880	we decided that we're done with it because Omicron was relatively mild. But what COVID becomes next,
6210880	6216480	I worry that certain people have much better understanding than you and I do, and that they
6216480	6221840	know why this is so dangerous. I'm worried that they the government lied twice for different reasons.
6222400	6225520	The first time I worry that they lied to protect what they were doing with
6226240	6232960	DITRA, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency. Why was it working with EcoHealth Alliance Wuhan Lab?
6232960	6238320	Why under kindly Dr. Fauci, who seems to have something to do with a weapons portfolio,
6238960	6243680	getting around a couple of treaties that we signed and ratified in the 70s. I have no idea.
6243760	6248320	But I think that that was a self-protective lying. And then I think that there may have been public
6248320	6254640	spirited lying saying if we could have told you what it is that we created in this cauldron,
6255840	6260960	we happen to have some inside information about this furan cleavage site and the potential to
6260960	6267360	attack T cells and the degradation and why this binds to so many different organs and can cross
6267360	6272080	the blood brain. I'm worried that they know that this is a much worse disease than it appears
6272080	6277520	and that we're going to find out over time why they were so draconian because it does look like
6277520	6282960	that they wildly overreacted, not to say that people didn't die, not to say that this wasn't
6282960	6289760	serious, but to shut down the world economy to the extent that they did clearly risked war
6290800	6298000	at some level. It wasn't that it was free. And so I'm very worried that we don't really understand
6298000	6304000	what COVID is and that Omicron seemed kind of relatively mild, but just wait something
6304560	6309200	that's going to be wave after wave. And we're going to learn over time what this thing really is.
6310800	6316480	Do you see the midterm elections coming off without a hitch? Do you think it'll be a nice,
6316480	6322640	smooth orderly? I don't want to say transition to power. I don't want to assume what direction
6322640	6325520	the elections are going to go. You think it's going to be a nice, smooth election of ever?
6325760	6332720	You're asking one of the middle children what to do about crazy mommy and crazy daddy and my
6332720	6344960	feeling is that dad should go off into his meth den and mom should move out of the house with
6344960	6350960	her various lovers and the same people who were left should try to get back to the United States
6350960	6357040	of America. I don't know how to do this. I view the Republican and Democratic parties as being
6357040	6364800	dead-enders. Again, it's the Thelma and Louise problem. Do you decide that Thelma is better than
6364800	6373360	Louise if Louise takes longer to hit the ground by a nanosecond? I don't know. I view, I'm so,
6375200	6378800	you know what I've become? I've become a tensionist. It's like you've got bloods and
6378800	6383760	crypts running your neighborhood and you don't want to go blood or crypt. You just want them to
6383760	6389200	fight each other enough so that the rest of you can go to work, go to school, and buy some groceries
6389200	6398080	without being terrorized. More upbeat note. Are we headed for an U.S. involvement on the ground
6398800	6407600	in the Ukraine? Next question. Are you excited about any recent discoveries in physics? We talked
6407600	6412800	about the W Boson mass discrepancy. By the way, it's not that the mass itself is so much higher.
6412800	6417440	It's that the precision is so with tension with the standard model. Not that you said that,
6417440	6422880	but there are people in the chatroom wondering, is it eight times too high, five sigma? No,
6422880	6430640	it's higher. The bounds on this thing are radically, radically tightened up. This is a new data,
6430720	6438960	this old data, new analysis. It should be taken with some degree of caution. But to that end,
6438960	6443920	people have been speculating about the role of fifth forces and all sorts of things ranging from
6444880	6451920	G-2 discrepancy, the magnetic moment of the muon, etc. There are a lot of tensions. I always say
6451920	6457120	physicists need a psychologist. I think we've got so much tension on our minds. Where do you think,
6457840	6462320	what's exciting you? If you were a young physicist or if you knew a young physicist
6462320	6468880	who's starting out, what would you advise her to do? What excites you most in physics?
6469600	6473920	A theorist? We should talk about an experimentalist and a theorist. I think we should talk about the
6473920	6478880	experimentalist first because I think one of the things that you've done is to emphasize that
6478880	6485440	constantly focusing on the lead singer. We're always talking about Mick Jagger and Keith Richards
6485520	6490800	holding it down and making the thing awesome. Let's talk evenly about them. What should a
6490800	6497120	young experimentalist do? My feeling about that is you should figure out where there might be money
6497120	6502480	and where there might be new tools. I would be thinking a lot about high precision experiments.
6502480	6508800	I would be thinking a lot about gravitational waves because that's still relatively new. I would
6508880	6515440	be thinking a great deal about which of these hints beyond the standard model physics
6518240	6526320	might be most promising. How would I go about the G-2 anomaly or the W anomaly or any of the
6526320	6533600	other anomalies? What are the tools? The interstitial thing, as you were saying, in some sense,
6533600	6540640	new analysis of old data is new data of a kind because we have to process the original raw
6540640	6548400	data. It's never pristinely coming from the universe itself directly. What am I super excited
6548400	6557520	about? I'm super excited about getting back to the big questions. We traded all of our big questions
6557520	6561920	for can you quantize gravity, which assumes that gravity wants to be quantized the way
6561920	6568640	everything else wanted to be quantized. I'm tired of talking about white supremacy, but quantum
6568640	6576000	supremacy, we can call it quantum maximalism. It's sort of like dealing with Bitcoin maximalists.
6576880	6582800	The people with the laser eyes are telling you quantize gravity rather than make the quantum
6582800	6588560	more geometric because gravity has always been geometric since Einstein. What I'm super excited
6588640	6596320	about in mass is looking at the different ways that mass can be generated inside of the models.
6597360	6602160	Let's come up with three separate ways that you can generate mass. One way is that you could have
6602160	6608320	more things to differentiate. If a piece of a derivative gains mass by differentiating something
6608320	6613840	like a Higgs field, maybe there are multiple Higgs fields and the more mass somehow comes out of a
6613840	6620480	richer Higgs sector. That's one of the things that might be interesting. There's a very funny
6620480	6626000	result from dimension three. It's peculiar to dimension three called topological mass that was
6626000	6635760	pioneered by Roman, Jacob and others. That says that if you have a Yang-Mills term, so forgive me,
6636800	6641120	if you have a term that looks like this at the top of the cup with the double F's,
6642000	6650720	and then you add another term that looks a little bit more like a matter equation. It's only got one
6650720	6656800	derivative rather than two, sort of like the Dirac equation. It's called the Churn-Simon's term.
6658400	6663520	In dimension three, that gives you a new way to generate mass that's not available elsewhere.
6664480	6672800	Then there's another way of generating mass, which is seemingly verboten, which is to put in a direct
6672800	6679840	mass term for something like the W particle. Rather than a soft mass term, which gains the
6679840	6690000	appearance of mass through an interaction. I'll stop using this mug. I believe that in GU there
6690080	6696160	are ways to generate mass directly rather than indirectly that don't violate gauge conservation.
6696880	6705680	There are three mass mechanism channels that I'm looking at in GU relative to the discovery of
6705680	6714800	the W particle. This is something that I was excited about before, but I don't know. What are
6714800	6720080	you supposed to say? If everything is working fine, it was an embarrassment that there were these
6720080	6726560	extra terms. It's there in the draft. You can see where the mass is generated, but I don't think
6726560	6733920	actually I put in the Yang-Millsian part to the draft because of having something to do with the
6733920	6742560	Higgs sector, which I'm very excited about. The prospect for generating mass in novel ways,
6743440	6747760	I think, I expect to be one of the most exciting things to be coming out.
6749440	6754800	Well, on that note, my friend, I want to wish everybody celebrating out there.
6754800	6760160	Wait, wait, there was a guitar question. Oh yeah, a guitar question. So you made a guitar question.
6760160	6771280	Is the guitar hero dead? It's an interesting puzzle. We just had this dinner where I was
6771280	6776320	invited by a guy named Pliny. Yeah, talk about this picture. This guy tattooed everywhere except
6776320	6782080	for maybe the whites of his eyes. You're talking about Tim Henson. Oh yeah. Tim Henson is,
6783200	6788000	I don't even know how to describe what kind of a wild guitarist he is, but look up Polyphia Goat
6788000	6793920	for the most famous thing that he did. I give the example. It's sort of like Havana Unana,
6794480	6801520	you know, but imagine that you had or like smooth. It's got this kind of a Latin
6803280	6811760	rhythm and feel of flow. But imagine that somebody was juggling a Faberge egg, a running chainsaw,
6811760	6818960	and a nuclear weapon. And like, it was just incredibly difficult to imagine the different
6818960	6824640	things that they had to do when they were catching each one of these things. Tim is mixing up all
6824640	6834160	sorts of ingenious, I just love this guy, ingenious ways of taking and deconstructing and
6834160	6840320	reconstructing. I want to emphasize reconstructing. Things that our brains and ears want to hear
6840320	6848000	and are used to hearing, but need to be made fresh and new. So I think that Tim is one of the most
6848000	6853520	exciting guitarists out there. But I want to just, I want to flog a bunch of names very quickly,
6853520	6859920	people who are exciting me. Pliny's exciting me. Rick Beato is doing amazing things on his channel.
6861520	6868800	We are being treated to Mike Dawes and Tommy Immanuel touring the country. Mike Isengur of
6868800	6876640	Incubus. John Mayer is one of the most unbelievable pedagogues out there. So he's not only playing
6876640	6884480	his heart out with the blues, with the level of people like Joe Bonamassa and other people in
6884480	6893760	that idiom guy named Kingfish and Eric Gales and Josh Smith. I'm just naming a bunch of people who,
6893760	6899360	if you're not, if you want to get excited again about guitar, listen to these people
6900240	6910240	as well as get excited about the gear. What's going on in gear? The folks at Positive Grid just
6910240	6917280	sent me a tiny amp that is effectively your charge. You know, it's a little cube, this big,
6917280	6923120	and I've got the world's greatest amplifier simulated inside of this tiny little thing.
6923440	6931040	What's going on at Neural DSP and their ability to simulate and capture instruments,
6931040	6936000	and then you can capture your own amplifier and digitize it.
6937520	6945600	So Doug Castro is doing amazing things. The people at High Vibe Acoustic Guitar are blowing my mind
6945600	6952720	by putting reverb echo inside a classical instrument effectively, or a wood instrument.
6953520	6960640	This is out of France. And what they're doing is turning our, they're blurring the line between
6960640	6965040	an electric and acoustic guitar. So you can have distortion on an acoustic guitar because
6965040	6971520	it takes the signal in and then it transforms it and then it uses the vibrating wood, which is where
6971520	6976960	we hear most of the sound. It's not from the strings, it's from the wood. That stuff is being
6976960	6984320	vibrated by these little, I forget, actuators or whatever they could call them. I think guitar is
6984320	6991200	incredibly exciting right now, and I think that what we're missing is we're missing spontaneity
6991200	6996720	and the blues and whatever it is that caused every show to be wildly different. We have too many
6996720	7004560	people practicing very, very carefully. And I'll just shout out Tosin Abasi and Misha Mansour,
7004560	7011120	and I'm going to have more to say about this. Got it. Well, Eric, can't thank you enough.
7011120	7016160	People are asking you to break out a guitar, but I didn't ask you to plan that out. So unless you
7016160	7021280	happen to have a little strat nearby, we'll have to do that next time. And people are asking us to
7021280	7027040	go deep into the mug. So I think what we should do next time is explore the mug in some detail. So
7027040	7032720	on this channel. I would love to do that. But I would like to get some video aids, and the two
7032720	7039200	of us get excited about letting people know here's the recipe for the universe so that maybe not
7039200	7044320	everybody becomes a quantum field theorist instantly. But this is the greatest show on earth.
7044320	7050320	There's nothing more interesting than this. And you shouldn't get frozen out of it just because
7050320	7053680	you didn't math didn't agree with you in high school. So that's what I have to say.
7054400	7060080	That's right. So we tied in guitar strings and string theory. So Eric, we do have facilities
7060080	7064960	for that. We have an enormous green screen glass whiteboard down here at UC San Diego,
7064960	7070320	where you're always welcome. You know where your office is and Japanese whiskey. We have Japanese
7070320	7076560	whiskey. We have Cuban cigars. We have giant mushrooms. And we have assorted accoutrements
7076560	7081760	to go along with that. I want to notify people next week, there's going to be a big press release
7081760	7087360	coming from the event horizon telescope, headed by my friend chef Doleman at Harvard Center for
7087360	7092800	Astrophysics. And they're making an announcement involving a black hole in the Milky Way Galaxy.
7092800	7098080	Now, I don't know about you, but I have a feeling it has to do with the ginormous six million solar
7098080	7103600	mass at the center of black hole, the black hole, the black hole unless they've discovered another
7103600	7107200	black hole. And that would be almost you don't know what this announcement is. Are you teasing us?
7107200	7112560	Do you actually know announcement of a press conference coming on Thursday next week, the 12th
7112560	7121920	of May? I have a video queued up. I've done an interview. I don't know. I have my very strong
7121920	7128240	suspicions. And so I will have a video out that day about the results on this channel. So I hope
7128240	7133680	people will subscribe. I do a lot of introductory kind of physics videos, but I do a lot of advanced
7133680	7138720	physics and take the experimentalist tack. As Eric said, I love to go deep dive. I love my
7138720	7143280	theorist friends. My best friends are theorists, including Eric and Stefan. Would you want your
7143280	7153600	daughter to marry one? I would allow one of them. But in the same token. Experimentalists need some
7153600	7159200	love, too. The unsung exterminators of all theories in the universe. So for now, and I wish you all
7160080	7166640	a fruitful Cinco de Mayo. We're going to go out drinking next time we're together, some tequila,
7166640	7174320	and we'll have to avoid the anomalous worms. So I want to wish everybody that and tune in next
7174320	7179680	time to the Into the Impossible podcast with your fearful host, Dr. Brian Keating, and his
7179680	7184560	friendly friend, Eric. You're looking wonderful. Can't wait to we're in person and all seriousness.
7184560	7190560	Miss you, buddy. Been too long. All right, brother. Best to everybody. And I'll talk to you soon. Bye.
7190560	7194480	Thanks, friend.
