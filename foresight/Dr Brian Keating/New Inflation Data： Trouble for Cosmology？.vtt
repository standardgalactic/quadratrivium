00:00.000 --> 00:03.080
In 2001, 20 years ago this year,

00:03.080 --> 00:05.520
my colleagues Andrew Lang, Jamie Bock,

00:05.520 --> 00:08.120
and Bill Holtzampfel came up with a proposal

00:08.120 --> 00:10.640
for what would later be called Bicep.

00:10.640 --> 00:13.800
Bicep has morphed over the years into Bicep 2,

00:13.800 --> 00:16.440
Bicep 3, and now Bicep Array.

00:16.440 --> 00:18.160
It's a stunning series of experiments

00:18.160 --> 00:20.120
that unfortunately I'm no longer involved with

00:20.120 --> 00:22.840
if you've read my previous book,

00:22.840 --> 00:24.280
A Farewell to Arms.

00:24.280 --> 00:26.680
No, losing the Nobel Prize.

00:26.760 --> 00:30.720
I described how I came to both part ways with

00:30.720 --> 00:33.720
and also be inspired by the continuing developments

00:33.720 --> 00:34.920
with the Bicep team.

00:34.920 --> 00:36.800
Recently, an analysis was published

00:36.800 --> 00:38.080
in physical review letters,

00:38.080 --> 00:40.960
one of the most prestigious journals in all of physics,

00:40.960 --> 00:43.760
that has the most stringent limits to date

00:43.760 --> 00:47.000
on cosmic inflation and the observable signature

00:47.000 --> 00:49.240
that might or might not be present

00:49.240 --> 00:52.900
from an early inflationary expansion of the universe.

00:52.900 --> 00:54.920
While I'm not involved with the project anymore,

00:54.920 --> 00:57.120
I'm fascinated by it and I wanna explain to you

00:57.120 --> 00:58.560
the significance of these results

00:58.560 --> 01:00.800
and where will cosmologists go from here.

01:00.800 --> 01:02.440
Come along into the impossible.

01:04.640 --> 01:07.280
Any sufficiently advanced technology

01:07.280 --> 01:09.160
is indistinguishable from magic.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.160
Spoiler alert, we haven't discovered anything in this field

01:14.160 --> 01:16.560
in terms of unequivocal proof or evidence

01:16.560 --> 01:19.240
for an inflationary origin of the universe.

01:19.240 --> 01:20.800
There's a lot of circumstantial evidence,

01:20.800 --> 01:23.480
as we've talked about, but there's also competing models

01:23.480 --> 01:25.280
ranging from Sir Roger Penrose's

01:25.280 --> 01:28.000
conformal cyclic cosmology to Paul Steinhart

01:28.000 --> 01:30.440
and Aegis's bouncing cosmological models

01:30.440 --> 01:34.200
and many more that we will discuss in future videos.

01:34.200 --> 01:37.160
Now, the question of whether or not the universe originated

01:37.160 --> 01:40.400
in a massive superluminal expansion known as inflation

01:40.400 --> 01:43.400
has fascinated me personally since the early 2000s

01:43.400 --> 01:44.880
when I first came up with the idea

01:44.880 --> 01:47.360
to build a tiny refracting telescope,

01:47.360 --> 01:50.280
one that Galileo Galilei would surely recognize

01:50.280 --> 01:52.200
at the bottom of the world, Antarctica,

01:52.200 --> 01:53.840
specifically the South Pole.

01:53.840 --> 01:57.080
And over time, we made more and more sensitive upper limits.

01:57.080 --> 02:00.560
That is, we've excluded an inflationary energy event

02:00.560 --> 02:02.040
above a certain value.

02:02.040 --> 02:04.120
Cosmologists parameterize the amount

02:04.120 --> 02:07.320
of inflationary gravitational wave energy

02:07.320 --> 02:10.040
by what's known as the tensor to scalar ratio.

02:10.040 --> 02:12.000
The symbol is lowercase r.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.720
And that is the relative ratio

02:13.720 --> 02:15.560
between so-called gravitational wave

02:15.560 --> 02:18.160
or tensor perturbations and ordinary density

02:18.160 --> 02:19.360
or scalar perturbation.

02:19.360 --> 02:20.760
I'm your density.

02:20.760 --> 02:23.560
We've been setting limits on these effects

02:23.560 --> 02:25.200
for over a decade

02:25.200 --> 02:28.200
with the dedicated bicep series of experiments.

02:28.200 --> 02:30.360
And this new recent result comes

02:30.360 --> 02:33.840
from the bicep-3 incarnation of bicep,

02:33.840 --> 02:36.440
which is a massive expansion to anything

02:36.440 --> 02:39.480
I would have ever conceived of back in 2001.

02:39.480 --> 02:40.920
This is an instrument that has

02:40.920 --> 02:43.280
about a half a meter diameter aperture.

02:43.280 --> 02:45.920
And it's significantly larger, almost three times larger

02:45.920 --> 02:47.880
than the original bicep-1 aperture.

02:47.880 --> 02:50.740
It can cram in many, many more detectors.

02:50.740 --> 02:52.540
And couple those detectors

02:52.540 --> 02:56.700
with very, very sensitive phased array-type technology.

02:56.700 --> 02:59.940
In the original bicep-1, we only had 49

02:59.940 --> 03:02.740
polarized metal machine feed horns

03:02.740 --> 03:04.860
that we used to detect these tiny differences

03:04.860 --> 03:07.580
in the amount of polarization in the microwave background.

03:07.580 --> 03:09.660
But the incarnation of these telescopes

03:09.660 --> 03:11.220
from bicep-1 to bicep-2,

03:11.220 --> 03:13.900
which used transition and superconducting detectors,

03:13.900 --> 03:15.300
to the current bicep-3

03:15.300 --> 03:18.260
and now bicep array series of detectors,

03:18.260 --> 03:20.100
has been a slow, steady increase,

03:20.100 --> 03:23.940
not unlike your iPhone and its evolution from iPhone 1

03:23.940 --> 03:26.060
all the way up until the current iPhone 13.

03:27.260 --> 03:30.420
And back in 2001, we barely had iPods,

03:30.420 --> 03:32.340
and it's just stunning to think about

03:32.340 --> 03:34.620
how far the technology has come.

03:34.620 --> 03:36.940
And these detectors are made by brilliant colleague,

03:36.940 --> 03:40.740
Jamie Bach at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory,

03:40.740 --> 03:44.700
and also supported via a wide variety of scientists

03:44.700 --> 03:45.900
all over the world.

03:45.900 --> 03:46.940
And even though, as I say,

03:46.940 --> 03:49.980
I'm not involved with the bicep-3 and beyond incarnations,

03:49.980 --> 03:52.900
I still can't help but feel a tiny bit of interest,

03:52.900 --> 03:54.460
vested interest, if you will,

03:54.460 --> 03:56.460
in the success of the project.

03:56.460 --> 04:00.540
Recently, we heard a great fanfare announced

04:00.540 --> 04:02.660
because of the threshold that was reached

04:02.660 --> 04:04.220
by the bicep-3 experiment.

04:04.220 --> 04:08.260
This is reproduced from the physical review letters article

04:08.260 --> 04:10.020
I'll show it on the screen here,

04:10.020 --> 04:11.740
that broke through this barrier.

04:11.740 --> 04:14.260
It broke through what's called an uncertainty level

04:14.260 --> 04:16.700
on the amount of tensor to scalar ratio,

04:16.700 --> 04:18.460
the amount of gravitational wave energy

04:18.460 --> 04:19.620
in the early universe,

04:19.620 --> 04:22.860
produced presumably by an inflationary event

04:22.860 --> 04:24.940
where the Inflaton scalar field

04:24.940 --> 04:27.660
had fluctuations of the space-time metric

04:27.660 --> 04:29.500
that then nucleated waves of gravity,

04:29.500 --> 04:30.780
which travel at the speed of light,

04:30.780 --> 04:31.900
endure for all time,

04:31.900 --> 04:34.380
and can make it to our detectors even today,

04:34.380 --> 04:36.500
but we choose to detect them and their presence

04:36.500 --> 04:38.700
back on the surface of last scattering.

04:38.700 --> 04:40.340
And that surface of last scattering

04:40.340 --> 04:42.860
is an imprint, a fossil record of how the universe looked

04:42.860 --> 04:45.540
when it was only 380,000 years old.

04:45.540 --> 04:47.700
So we're kind of putting the detector system

04:47.700 --> 04:51.380
back as close as we can to the source of the explosion,

04:51.380 --> 04:52.740
if you will, if you think of inflation

04:52.740 --> 04:54.420
as a sort of type of explosion

04:54.420 --> 04:57.980
that ignited the big bang that we subsequently measured.

04:57.980 --> 05:00.860
The results reported by bicep recently

05:00.860 --> 05:04.580
indicate that we're below the 1% level of sensitivity.

05:04.580 --> 05:07.660
The precision level needed to measure gravitational waves

05:07.660 --> 05:10.220
has broken through the 1% barrier.

05:10.220 --> 05:11.780
And even though the likelihood

05:11.780 --> 05:13.500
of the gravitational wave signature

05:13.500 --> 05:17.060
is slightly above a mere two-time multiple

05:17.060 --> 05:18.460
of that one sigma result,

05:18.460 --> 05:20.100
namely the two sigma upper limit,

05:20.100 --> 05:24.100
is actually higher than the two times the 0.009

05:25.020 --> 05:27.260
our precision level.

05:27.260 --> 05:29.260
That's because the likelihood is slightly shifted over,

05:29.260 --> 05:32.620
i.e. it looks to the naked eye, to the untrained brain

05:32.620 --> 05:34.300
as if there's a slight detection

05:34.300 --> 05:36.340
of gravitational wave energy, but there's not.

05:36.340 --> 05:38.860
There's not significant enough to claim detection.

05:38.860 --> 05:41.300
But the power and the procession

05:41.300 --> 05:43.740
from the relatively crude measurements

05:43.740 --> 05:45.380
that we made with bicep one,

05:45.380 --> 05:47.220
and even other competing experiments,

05:47.220 --> 05:49.500
including my own experiments, the polar bear experiment,

05:49.500 --> 05:51.340
and other contemporary experiments,

05:51.340 --> 05:53.540
have yet to approach anywhere

05:53.540 --> 05:55.300
near this level of sensitivity.

05:55.300 --> 05:58.820
Now, we hope to proceed even further back in time

05:58.820 --> 06:00.660
and closer to the source

06:00.660 --> 06:04.020
of primordial tensor perturbations if they exist.

06:04.020 --> 06:06.340
And remember, the stakes could not be higher

06:06.340 --> 06:08.460
because if inflation takes place,

06:08.460 --> 06:09.980
many of the most prominent scientists

06:09.980 --> 06:12.660
do believe that the multiverse paradigm

06:12.660 --> 06:15.500
is also ushered into a state of believability,

06:15.500 --> 06:18.020
maybe even proof by discovering this.

06:18.020 --> 06:19.780
And that, we know for sure,

06:19.780 --> 06:21.100
would be one of the conclusions

06:21.100 --> 06:23.700
because that's what happened back in 2014

06:23.700 --> 06:26.700
when bicep two made the premature discovery claim

06:26.700 --> 06:28.460
that we had discovered gravitational waves

06:28.460 --> 06:31.340
from the universe's inflationary epoch.

06:31.340 --> 06:32.500
Now, that was retracted.

06:32.500 --> 06:34.180
Later on, our conclusion was retracted.

06:34.180 --> 06:35.020
We didn't make a blunder.

06:35.020 --> 06:36.820
The experiment is exquisitely sensitive

06:36.820 --> 06:37.900
and far more sensitive

06:37.900 --> 06:40.420
than any other experiment ever done of this type.

06:40.420 --> 06:43.660
But the interpretation as owing to a primordial cosmic event

06:43.660 --> 06:45.900
rather than dust in the Milky Way galaxy

06:45.900 --> 06:49.500
had to be essentially the disconfirmed result.

06:49.500 --> 06:51.820
So we weren't able to establish this conclusively.

06:51.820 --> 06:53.020
Now, it doesn't mean that gravitational waves

06:53.020 --> 06:53.860
don't exist.

06:53.860 --> 06:54.780
It doesn't mean inflation didn't take place.

06:54.780 --> 06:56.980
It doesn't mean the multiverse isn't true.

06:56.980 --> 06:58.340
But we would like to have evidence.

06:58.340 --> 07:01.700
And so the bicep three team has now taken data

07:01.700 --> 07:04.740
from more than just the one frequency we used in bicep two,

07:04.740 --> 07:06.380
namely two millimeter wavelength,

07:06.380 --> 07:08.700
150 gigahertz frequency.

07:08.700 --> 07:10.620
Or with bicep one, we had three channels,

07:10.620 --> 07:14.140
90 gigahertz, 150 gigahertz and 220 gigahertz.

07:14.140 --> 07:16.540
But those detectors, the very few of those

07:16.540 --> 07:18.820
operating in the higher frequency bands.

07:18.820 --> 07:21.260
Now cosmic dust in our Milky Way galaxy

07:21.260 --> 07:24.700
was the ultimate source of the large tensor to scalar ratio

07:24.700 --> 07:26.980
we claimed back in 2014

07:26.980 --> 07:29.620
and is the subject of losing the Nobel Prize.

07:29.620 --> 07:34.620
But that was later found to be able to be removed

07:34.780 --> 07:36.540
using data from the Planck satellite,

07:36.580 --> 07:38.620
who were our competitors at the time

07:38.620 --> 07:42.100
and still kind of frenemies and no, we're not enemies.

07:42.100 --> 07:44.420
But we did eventually collaborate together

07:44.420 --> 07:47.980
to reduce the uncertainty from dust

07:47.980 --> 07:49.700
and actually show that dust could contribute

07:49.700 --> 07:51.780
the dominant, the preponderance of the signal

07:51.780 --> 07:53.460
that we claim to observe.

07:53.460 --> 07:55.300
Now what's interesting is that bicep three

07:55.300 --> 07:58.500
is able in the very near future, if not now,

07:58.500 --> 08:01.020
to actually no longer need ancillary data

08:01.020 --> 08:03.500
from another instrument, namely from the Planck satellite

08:03.500 --> 08:05.900
to go deeper into the removal process

08:05.900 --> 08:07.740
to get rid of the cosmic schmutz

08:07.740 --> 08:11.180
that contaminates the local galactic neighborhood,

08:11.180 --> 08:13.940
the dirty window, the dusty window that we must look through

08:13.940 --> 08:16.020
with our cosmic instruments.

08:16.020 --> 08:18.340
So it's fascinating to note that kind of the gauntlet

08:18.340 --> 08:20.780
has been thrown down by this phenomenal team

08:20.780 --> 08:23.860
that continues to work on a single goal.

08:23.860 --> 08:25.860
And although there hasn't been a detection,

08:25.860 --> 08:27.340
this is an important proving ground

08:27.340 --> 08:29.660
because what it does is starts to eliminate

08:29.660 --> 08:32.860
many, many classes, entire classes of models

08:32.860 --> 08:35.300
of inflationary parameter space.

08:35.300 --> 08:37.180
So we're able to really narrow down

08:37.180 --> 08:39.660
and zoom in on the allowable regime

08:39.660 --> 08:43.660
in which these inflationary models could have taken place.

08:43.660 --> 08:46.620
Now, will we ever be able to rule out inflation?

08:46.620 --> 08:49.220
I claim no because even if we don't ever observe

08:49.220 --> 08:51.740
gravitational waves, we could still make the claim

08:51.740 --> 08:53.780
that inflation took place, but the energy scale

08:53.780 --> 08:57.700
of inflation was too low to manifest a observable background

08:57.700 --> 09:00.060
of gravitational radiation that persisted

09:00.060 --> 09:02.180
to this epoch of last scattering.

09:02.180 --> 09:05.780
So we can't really falsify that inflation took place.

09:05.780 --> 09:09.700
Some say that is a negative for the inflationary model

09:09.700 --> 09:12.740
and it's non-comporting with the scientific method,

09:12.740 --> 09:15.380
that things should be, as Karl Popper said, falsifiable

09:15.380 --> 09:17.220
in order to constitute good science.

09:17.220 --> 09:18.340
We've talked about that a lot.

09:18.340 --> 09:20.580
I won't go into it again in more detail.

09:20.580 --> 09:23.940
There are also haters of the inflationary theory

09:23.940 --> 09:26.640
that because it posits the existence of a multiverse,

09:26.640 --> 09:29.540
which some claim is antithetical to the scientific method

09:29.540 --> 09:31.700
because everything that can possibly happen

09:31.700 --> 09:33.380
does possibly happen.

09:33.380 --> 09:35.620
And we'll talk about that in a future video as well

09:35.620 --> 09:37.920
on the physics of free will coming soon.

09:37.920 --> 09:39.100
So where are we?

09:39.100 --> 09:42.260
We've ruled out a lot of inflationary models.

09:42.260 --> 09:45.380
We would need to measure an inflationary gravitational

09:45.380 --> 09:47.980
wave B mode signal that I've talked about

09:47.980 --> 09:50.900
at length in other videos in order to conclusively

09:50.900 --> 09:53.180
demonstrate the existence of these gravitational waves.

09:53.180 --> 09:55.620
And that would be important because that would not only

09:55.620 --> 09:57.860
help provide evidence for inflation

09:57.860 --> 10:00.460
and maybe even narrow down even further

10:00.460 --> 10:02.540
as much as humans could ever do narrowing down

10:02.540 --> 10:05.300
the varying parameters that characterize

10:05.300 --> 10:06.740
the inflationary universe.

10:06.740 --> 10:08.740
It would also eliminate other contenders

10:08.740 --> 10:10.500
for the cosmic genesis event.

10:10.500 --> 10:12.060
In other words, it would eliminate things

10:12.060 --> 10:14.820
like the bouncing model, the pyrotic model,

10:14.820 --> 10:17.740
the conformal cyclic cosmology of Sir Roger Penrose,

10:17.740 --> 10:20.380
the string gas cosmology of Robert Brandenburger

10:20.380 --> 10:22.460
and Cameron Waffa that we'll talk about

10:22.460 --> 10:24.220
in other videos on this channel.

10:24.220 --> 10:27.860
So this non-detection is actually an important stepping stone

10:27.860 --> 10:30.460
towards an ultimate measurement perhaps

10:30.460 --> 10:32.660
of the cosmic genesis phenomenon

10:32.660 --> 10:34.740
if indeed it did take place via inflation.

10:34.740 --> 10:37.220
And if it didn't, we may see surprising results

10:37.220 --> 10:38.380
along the way.

10:38.380 --> 10:40.660
So these are really truly heroic results.

10:40.660 --> 10:43.900
I'm happy for my former colleagues and friends

10:43.900 --> 10:45.620
on the bicep experiment.

10:45.620 --> 10:46.600
I wish them great success.

10:46.600 --> 10:49.660
And of course with our small aperture telescopes

10:49.660 --> 10:52.260
that we're building here at UC San Diego,

10:52.260 --> 10:54.980
at Princeton University at UC Berkeley,

10:55.020 --> 10:57.420
around the Simon's Observatory,

10:57.420 --> 10:59.100
our small aperture telescopes,

10:59.100 --> 11:02.120
these will hopefully set an important limit

11:02.120 --> 11:04.600
or constraint or detection perhaps

11:04.600 --> 11:07.140
of these primordial B mode polarization signals.

11:07.140 --> 11:10.000
And I claim, this is my editorial opinion,

11:10.000 --> 11:14.180
that one experiment cannot make a definitive claim anymore.

11:14.180 --> 11:18.100
We will not be satisfied in this field of cosmology

11:18.100 --> 11:19.720
unless two different experiments

11:19.720 --> 11:22.020
can confirm the same type of signal.

11:22.020 --> 11:23.580
They don't have to measure the exact same thing.

11:23.580 --> 11:25.500
That's almost impossible in science.

11:25.500 --> 11:28.260
They have to measure broad consistency

11:28.260 --> 11:30.340
so that we can develop a consensus that inflation

11:30.340 --> 11:31.180
took place.

11:31.180 --> 11:34.380
If again, if indeed it did, who knows if it did.

11:34.380 --> 11:35.700
But it's quite exciting to note

11:35.700 --> 11:39.340
that no one can really go to the limits themselves.

11:39.340 --> 11:42.460
No one goes to Stockholm themselves anymore.

11:42.460 --> 11:44.780
We need to have confirmation if indeed this exists.

11:44.780 --> 11:47.860
And I think that hopefully we will make great progress.

11:47.860 --> 11:50.060
Again, as a scientist, you never wanna bias yourself

11:50.060 --> 11:51.820
with the confirmation prejudice

11:51.820 --> 11:53.140
that you are going to detect

11:53.140 --> 11:54.460
that which you set out to detect

11:54.460 --> 11:56.660
because it often leads you to reject things

11:56.660 --> 11:58.620
that are perfectly acceptable

11:58.620 --> 12:01.100
but just don't comport with your philosophical

12:01.100 --> 12:02.780
or scientific worldview.

12:02.780 --> 12:04.540
So for now, this exciting news

12:04.540 --> 12:08.060
released from the BISEP team, the BISEP3 team

12:08.060 --> 12:10.980
and eagerly awaiting new results

12:10.980 --> 12:13.700
to come from this exciting field,

12:13.700 --> 12:15.940
including results that will come from hopefully

12:15.940 --> 12:17.280
right here at UC San Diego

12:17.280 --> 12:20.460
and the Simons Observatory team around the world.
