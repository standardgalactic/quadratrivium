1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
The fear that comes out of whatever is left of the core community is you guys don't have a right

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,920
to go direct to a consumer. You don't have a right to talk about the field. That belongs to a tiny

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,720
number of people who do this morning, noon, and night who are all possessed of common beliefs.

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:22,160
There have to be some standards. On the other hand, the core group that's been trying to gate this has failed.

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:30,640
We have graciously been joined with two of the most prominent and two of my real heroes in this

6
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:37,680
field that are maverick mathematicians who are self-made mathematicians in a way. And I want to

7
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:44,720
talk about how they view the current spirit of the times as zeitgeist, as we say, in terms of

8
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:51,280
theories of everything that are percolating around in the atmosphere. And to begin with,

9
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:57,520
I'll ask my guest, Eric, to introduce yourself and say a little bit about where people can find

10
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,160
you. We'll do that right up front. And then we'll get started with our discussion topics. We're

11
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,440
going to have a nice clean fight. We're going toe to toe. No, there's not going to be any fight.

12
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:11,120
It's going to be very, very respectful. So thank you both for joining. Eric, can you introduce

13
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:16,160
yourself? And I'll buy me some time to tweet out this link. Check my feed. Eric Weinstein,

14
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:23,120
I'm a managing director at Teal Capital. I come from a mathematics background. So I'm not a

15
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:32,640
physicist. And I have an eclectic podcast called The Portal, which I hope to have. In fact, I've

16
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,760
got agreements from both of these gentlemen to be my guests on The Portal. So I'm really looking

17
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:43,600
forward to that and happy to help blow up into the impossible. Brian, you're doing a fantastic

18
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:49,040
job. I love it. And it's all thanks to you guys. You guys were actually my first guest in what I

19
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:55,520
call the pandemic podcast series, which began back in April, actually late March with Stephen.

20
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:00,000
It was the first of the two of you to come on the podcast and really kicked off this whole idea

21
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:07,040
of getting some of the world's most brilliant minds to engage around this topic of understanding

22
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,080
the fundamental nature of the universe. And at that time, because of the pandemic, perhaps,

23
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:18,400
Stephen's schedule was amenable to coming on my podcast. So we chatted for a mere three hours or

24
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,440
so. And he's, as I said, gracious enough to come back. Stephen, where are you joining us from today?

25
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:31,280
I'm in Concord, Massachusetts. And do I introduce myself? I'm Stephen Wolfram. I do science and

26
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:37,120
technology and things I've built. Some technology things lots of people use. I've built some science

27
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:44,560
lots of people use. And about 30 years ago, well, I used to be a particle physicist long ago.

28
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:53,440
I did that when I was a kid. And then I got interested in computation and have kind of

29
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:59,440
alternated between doing basic science and doing technology. And I've now done about five cycles

30
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,960
of that. And I think it's a very interesting process, actually, alternating between basic

31
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:09,360
science and technology, because they kind of build on each other. And it's sort of a

32
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:16,960
progressively spiral upwards, so to speak. But the big surprise for me was about a bit more

33
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:21,840
than a year ago now, a bunch of things that I've been thinking about, about how to make a fundamental

34
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:28,880
theory of physics. I actually thought, I think I actually have some way forward. And a couple of

35
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:33,360
young physicists were really enthusiastic about working with me on it. And so we're like, okay,

36
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:39,520
let's try and really do something. And the huge surprise is that it's worked. And which I didn't

37
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:46,640
expect. Yeah, I mean, it's, you know, we've been, we're at 100 years, roughly for, you know,

38
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,520
general relativity and quantum mechanics, which are the two sort of big achievements of 20th

39
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:58,800
century physics. And, you know, they've taken us a great distance. But, you know, I had a bunch

40
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:03,120
of ideas that have been sort of based on things that came out of the whole computational thinking

41
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:09,440
that I've done. And anyway, the big surprise that's worked, and not only that it seemed to have worked

42
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:15,440
when I last talked to you, it's been going absolutely spectacularly since then. And it's,

43
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,440
it's really, it's really, it's kind of like embarrassing, because there are a lot of things

44
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:25,520
I should have been able to figure out 20, 30 years ago, which are now becoming obvious. And I think

45
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:31,520
one of the other things to say is that one of the surprises to me is that I had thought we were

46
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:37,040
building this kind of prong in the direction of kind of computation that would be really different

47
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,600
from the mathematical physics and so on that people had done before. Turns out we basically

48
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,480
built a sort of a low level machine code for how things work. But it turns out an awful lot of the

49
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:54,160
formalisms that people have worked on in mathematical physics the last 50 years or so, they actually

50
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,280
fit beautifully into the kinds of things that we're doing. And they seem to kind of illuminate

51
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,480
what we've done and hopefully what we've done illuminates what they're doing. And I, I actually,

52
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:09,760
my favorite analogy in recent times for this is what happened in early days of computation theory

53
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,880
with things like Turing machines, which was that people had come up with, you know, models of

54
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:20,160
computation, combinators, lambda calculus, general recursive functions, things like this.

55
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,640
But it wasn't clear how they fit together. And they all seemed rather abstract. And people

56
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:29,520
couldn't kind of tether them. And then Turing machines came along. And, you know, in the usual

57
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,720
way that science history is done, we could say immediately everybody understood. But actually,

58
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:40,000
it took, let's see how long, 40 years, 50 years. So immediately it was actually 40 or 50 years.

59
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,920
But the people understood from from that kind of more concrete tethering of these ideas about

60
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:50,240
computation, how all these different things fit together. So that's been, that's been, I mean,

61
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,200
it's both both scientifically interesting to me. And I think also sociologically interesting,

62
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:00,640
because often, you know, you come in with the big new theory, so to speak. And it's like,

63
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,280
you're kind of gunning down everything else. But that's not what's happening here. I mean,

64
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,120
what's happening here is that we've got something which is sort of orthogonal to what other people

65
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:15,120
have thought about. It's kind of a low level, you know, low level machine code. And we can kind of,

66
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,760
you know, see how things fit together at a higher level. That's your elevator pitch that goes to

67
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:25,520
the space elevator stage docking station. Thank you, Steven. And both of you guys are notable,

68
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:32,160
as people are pointing out in the chat, which I'm monitoring. So behave in there. I am seeing a lot

69
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,000
of, you know, questions from younger people. And I think the two of you in particular,

70
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,560
have an ability that other scientists have not yet really been able to achieve, which is to

71
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,440
engage young people. And Steven, you just talked about engagement by these young physics students

72
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:53,600
that we and I spoke about in our first conversation back in April. And with Eric, people are,

73
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,960
you know, engaged on Discord, on comments, and people all over the Internet are really engaged

74
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:04,160
with it. What do you think it does? You know, this podcast, the Intangible Podcast, I like to

75
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,520
fashion myself as, you know, someday I'll be the Joe Rogan of physics. There's already one Joe Rogan.

76
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,400
But I'd like to know, what is it about these theories of everything that really engages young

77
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,040
people? And what I want to do is kind of translate. It's fascinating that you have this sort of bucket,

78
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:26,160
theories of everything. I don't kind of view it as a bucket like that. For me, you know, I spent my

79
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:32,000
life basically developing computation. And, you know, the fact that I happen to have discovered

80
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,440
that that relates to kind of fundamental theory of physics is kind of a singular event, as far as

81
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:44,320
I'm concerned. It's a kind of the bucket of theories of everything is not a bucket I particularly

82
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,920
identify with. Right. If I could agree with Stephen, there can only be one.

83
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,960
That was what I said today. There's a Highlander by Highlander.

84
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,080
One of the surprising things that we've discovered is that really isn't true.

85
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,880
There can be many ways of approaching that theory.

86
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:01,440
Yes. But the thing that's interesting is that, you know, you could say there's only,

87
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,400
fair enough, I mean, depends what you mean by only one. That's an interesting kind of ontological,

88
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,800
epistemological question. But I mean, it's like, you know, you could say about computation. There

89
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,880
could only be one theory of computation and it's Turing machines or it and its general recursive

90
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:21,520
functions. The thing that's surprising about physics that has become increasingly clear is that

91
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,960
the this kind of there's this notion of, you know, what are the possible, what are the underlying

92
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,840
rules? And then how do we observe those underlying rules? And it's becoming clear that you can

93
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:38,160
basically the only thing that is absolutely rigid is the underlying rules are computational

94
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:43,760
and not hyper computational. That is, once you say that the underlying rules are purely

95
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:51,120
computational, it then follows, it seems that the things we observe from 20th century physics

96
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:58,880
are inevitable consequences of that and a few other kind of unspecific assumptions.

97
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:04,080
It's a hard thing to explain. And actually, we're just, I think, okay, so here's a remarkable

98
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,880
connection that's just been becoming clear. So we have this notion of, you know, you have some

99
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:15,200
underlying rules, you follow these rules, you, you know, reproduce how the universe works.

100
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:22,400
But on the other side of that, we are observing how these rules are working and interpreting them

101
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:30,800
to say this is how the universe works. The thing that is surprising is that one can, I mean, in

102
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,040
the language of our kind of theory, there's this thing called the rural multiway system,

103
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:41,040
which is this kind of this branching system that's that runs sort of all possible rules.

104
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,520
And this is we're now jumping into the most abstract, most, most complicated. But I just

105
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:49,840
want to say one thing about it, which is kind of kind of interesting, which is it's turning out

106
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:54,800
that this incredibly abstract thing that we have this rural multiway system, appears to be the

107
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,920
same as this thing called the infinity groupoid, which was developed by growth and deek. And

108
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:06,560
when it was at the 70s, I guess, 1970s, which is kind of a pinnacle of abstraction of category

109
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,600
theory in other areas of mathematics. And what is really quite remarkable to me is that it seems

110
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,720
like this thing that's coming out of our theory kind of maps into this incredibly abstract

111
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:24,240
mathematical thing. And the observations that we have of the universe correspond to a particular,

112
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:32,000
in mathematical terms, kind of vibration of this infinity groupoid thing. And that basically what

113
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:39,680
we're our our way of interpreting the universe is kind of a slice of that of that mathematical

114
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:46,960
object. And so it's the statement, there's only one theory, in a sense, all these theories are

115
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:53,280
equivalent. But the, you know, the question is how how we are observing them. I was making a

116
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:58,960
pop culture reference. The intellectual spirit of it is that you can have a summit and there are

117
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:06,320
many faces that could be used as assaults on that summit. In the end, however we traverse,

118
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:12,640
you know, Einstein, for example, came up with his divergence free equations after some rumbling

119
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,840
around in differential geometry, Hilbert went, you know, immediately to a Lagrangian description,

120
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:23,600
they were describing something in common. So I didn't mean to suggest that there was a single

121
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:31,200
description, but there can really only be one underlying theory. And we all of us who are,

122
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,960
I was trying to agree with you, Steven, that the most probable number for wrong guests on this

123
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:44,480
live stream is two. But in all probability, if it is not two, then one of us is wrong. It strikes me

124
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,360
that you have gained confidence that what you are doing is actually not only capable

125
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:55,600
of producing a fundamental final theory. And we can talk about what the right language is,

126
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,560
I'm not wedded to any particular description, if you have an objection. But it sounds to me like

127
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:09,040
you are increasingly convinced that week by week, this is really the most promising assault

128
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:16,400
on our foundations. First of all, if I'm wrong, I hope that you or Garrett Leasy or one of these

129
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:21,040
other crazy people turns out to be right. It would be a pleasure to lose to you, sir.

130
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:28,640
The thing to understand is the kind of system that we've built, it is very likely that, you know,

131
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:32,080
I don't understand what you've done, but you know, I know a little bit of the mathematical

132
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:37,600
background, you know, the whole, for example, understanding local gauge invariance and understanding

133
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:43,040
how fiber bundles work in our systems, as a student actually at our recent summer school,

134
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:48,320
mathematical physicist, who managed to make great progress on that. And it's actually very clever

135
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:54,240
and much simpler than I expected. The way that essentially sort of fiber bundle type structures

136
00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:00,480
and local gauge invariance arise in our theories. Now, what you do with it once it's arisen from

137
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,840
this kind of low level machine code, that's, you know, often running with much more traditional

138
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:10,480
mathematical physics. And I don't think that there's a, you know, it's not an incompatible thing to

139
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:16,160
say, oh, there's some complicated structure to do with, you know, high dimensional systems and

140
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,200
fiber bundles and so on. That doesn't, that's not like, there's no, there's no divide yet.

141
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:27,920
Let's try to state how you and I could both be fit into the discussion that Brian is trying to

142
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:34,400
conduct. One thing I definitely agree that, you know, conciliance is nice and it's wonderful to

143
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:39,760
have consonants what the viewers want as argumentation. I'm just kidding. I don't care about that,

144
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,960
but when I do, she gets Sabina back on. Exactly. I think it would be really a great outcome of this

145
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:50,000
discussion would be kind of the joining of your two different, different approaches. I don't know

146
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,160
about Eric's stuff. So I can't really comment on that. The people out in that are watching that

147
00:13:54,160 --> 00:14:00,400
have, as you just said, fiber bundles, hop vibration, gauge invariance, but way of having

148
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:05,040
sort of a Rosetta Stone. If there are people out there, I'm not asking or asking you guys,

149
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:11,520
God forbid, with homework, but people in the respective domain experts in both of your two

150
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:15,840
categories, I think that would be an interesting kind of project to see. Can these be reconciled?

151
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:19,600
So maybe I should explain what we're doing. Okay, because there's a fairly large effort at this

152
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,480
point. What's been happening, you talk about engaging young people, you know, what I've been

153
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,320
trying to figure out how to do this, because there's been a lot of enthusiasm for our project,

154
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,040
a lot of people interested, a lot of people say, I want to contribute to this project. Okay.

155
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:39,440
So right now we have, we're just about to kind of roll out, I think we have 30 research affiliates

156
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,080
and junior research affiliates who are mostly people who came to the summer school that we just

157
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:50,080
spent a month having. And they're people who are sort of in motion, sort of doing research

158
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:55,040
along the lines of this project and, you know, producing papers and so on. And, you know, one

159
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,440
of the important objectives there, there's several important objectives, but one of them is

160
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:06,240
making these bridges to other kind of mathematical physics approaches. Another thing is just being

161
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,120
able to check off the list. There are, you know, these effects known in quantum mechanics, there

162
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:17,280
are these features of general activity, for example, can we go down the list and say, okay, you know,

163
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:22,640
we have destructive interference, we have spin statistics connections, we have this, we have

164
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:27,280
that. The thing that's just absolutely amazing is every time I think one of these is going to be

165
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:32,320
really hard, it turns out to be much easier than I think. And that's been a big surprise to me. I

166
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:39,440
mean, I've been, my expectations keep on being kind of exceeded. And I think that the, I mean,

167
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,680
the other question is, for example, for something like general activity, which I know, you know,

168
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:49,680
you have a lovely cosmic microwave background globe and the back there, it's some right,

169
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:54,880
it's very cool. Yeah, it's weird that it's kind of the inversion of the sky, so to speak.

170
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:00,480
Yeah, God's I view, right. Yeah, right. You know, so for example, there's the, you know,

171
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:06,480
we have a sort of mathematical proof that in some limit, we can reproduce general activity.

172
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:12,080
But the question is, can you actualize that? And so here's an interesting example of how sort of,

173
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:17,040
you know, a direction we're going in, which is an interesting sort of way to validate theories,

174
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:22,240
the following thing. So when people normally study gravitation theory, they say, oh, we've

175
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:27,680
got Einstein's equations from 1915, they work great. But if we actually want to find out her

176
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:33,120
two black holes merge, we don't get to kind of work out, you know, with Mathematica or something,

177
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:38,160
the exact, you know, result for, you know, how this black hole merger will work, we have to

178
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,720
make numerical approximations to the Einstein equations, sort of break them down into something

179
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:49,520
discreet, solve them on a computer, see what the implications for this process are. But that,

180
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:54,080
that kind of break down the Einstein equations into something discreet that can be solved on a

181
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:58,720
computer, there's an alternative way to think about that, which is start from our theory,

182
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:05,040
which is born as something that you can run on a computer, and then go up from there to get to

183
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:09,120
something which can reproduce what happens in black holes and so on. And so, you know,

184
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:13,280
this is the kind of thing I happened to do this years ago with fluid dynamics,

185
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:18,080
where you can start with these very simple, in that case cellular automaton models of fluid dynamics

186
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:22,320
and build up from those to actually reproduce fluid phenomena. But anyway, so the thing is

187
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:27,040
what I might call proof by compilation, so to speak, which is you're going from the kind of

188
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:33,040
low level structure of the model to actually do computations that can then be compared with

189
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:36,960
black hole dynamics, even though you sort of know it has to work, because you have a mathematical

190
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,120
proof that the two things are equivalent. But it's very satisfying to see it actually work,

191
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,920
it hasn't, we haven't, you know, done that yet, but we're in the process of doing it.

192
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,320
And more interestingly, actually in quantum field theory, where numerical methods have been much

193
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:55,600
harder to apply, it looks like we have a pretty good way to do sort of numerical quantum field

194
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,480
theory in a different way than it's been done before. When you say it's easy, by what metric

195
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:07,200
or what measure function are you defining that? Easy in terms of, you know, just easy for a brilliant,

196
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:13,360
you know, grandmaster of physics to unravel, or easy in terms of computational efficiency in some

197
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,160
sense? No, I mean, for example, one of the things is, do we have to know how electrons work to be

198
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:23,280
able to, or do we have to know what photons in detail are before we can reproduce effects in

199
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:29,440
quantum mechanics? The answer is, a lot of these phenomena seem to be more generic than I expected

200
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:37,920
and more amenable to being kind of explained without having that whole tower of features built.

201
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:44,560
So that's the main thing I mean by easier. I think in terms of the technical difficulty

202
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:49,040
and the mathematical depth of what's going on, we're doing what physicists often do, which is

203
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:54,080
we're skating over many of the mathematical difficulties. I mean, in some of these derivations,

204
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,880
there are like 12 different limits that have to be taken of, you know, this thing is small

205
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,640
compared to the size of the universe, but large compared to this, but small compared to the curvature

206
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,840
of that, but large compared to this and so on. And, you know, each one of those limits is a

207
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:13,360
significant amount of mathematical work to validate and so on. And, you know, this is the

208
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,920
typical thing that's been done by physicists through the ages, I'm afraid, that just skate

209
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:22,160
right over those things. Now, we have a big advantage, which was you can do computer experiments. So

210
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,760
we kind of know it's going to work. I mean, we know we're not going to be too far off because

211
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:30,800
we can actually check a bunch of these things in actual experiments. Although the experiments we do,

212
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,560
you know, if the universe has 10 to the 400, you know, atoms of space in it,

213
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,280
we certainly don't have that many in our computer. So we're doing very small versions of this.

214
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,600
You know, I want to say that I think it might be interesting for us to talk a little bit about

215
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:48,960
kind of the more sort of societal and structural aspects rather than getting too deep into the

216
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:54,400
into the. Sure. Wait a minute. I was looking to get, I wanted to get into the into the damn weeds.

217
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,080
Go for it. We will. We will. But yeah, small, small amount of weed,

218
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,360
weed whacking. And then then we can talk about some the bigger picture of science and the world

219
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:08,240
and so on, which I think I think we probably both have things to say about. I think that segues

220
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:13,760
nicely into a question that I brought up with with both of you separately and then earlier

221
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:19,840
today. And that's kind of the structure of the way that scientific revolutions take place. And

222
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:25,120
it's become a trope, you know, nowadays to say there's a paradigm shift, which is brought upon

223
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:30,880
by some new idea, radical, usually some lone genius like you guys working almost in solitude.

224
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,720
I'm just teasing, but just going to get us into trouble with Reddit. That's all you're doing.

225
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,680
You're just bathing Reddit. Well, hopefully Dr. Reddit is not watching yet. I guarantee she is.

226
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:44,000
What do you think about this notion of paradigm shifts? Do you think it's really the way that

227
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,000
science takes place? Or is it just sort of a retro retrospective, retradiction, historical

228
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,040
narrative of what has taken place that is just convenient as a hack for the human mind to say,

229
00:20:55,040 --> 00:21:00,160
okay, in retrospect, the paradigm shifted with Galileo's observation of the Jovian satellites.

230
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:05,280
What do you, Eric, think about this notion of CUNY and paradigm shifting? You have to

231
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:11,600
have lived through stasis and stagnation and through revolution and boom.

232
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:18,000
And even if the boom isn't the largest boom on record, like, you know, the Gold Rush or something,

233
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,920
in science, I lived through one or two revolutions, one of which was a Rosetta Stone between

234
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:30,160
differential geometry and quantum field theory, or at least the structure underneath quantum field

235
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:35,280
theory that was figured out in the mid 1970s. It doesn't have a historical, like you can't go to a

236
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:44,080
biopic about it, which is weird. But your friend Jim Simons, Brian, and C. N. Yang, arguably,

237
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:50,320
maybe the greatest of living physicists, figured this out over lunch. And that revolution is going

238
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:55,360
on to this day called the Wu Yang Dictionary. There was another one having to do with the

239
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:00,880
discovery that quantum field theory was a mathematically natural structure, not just a

240
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:06,000
grab bag of techniques, and that it would have been discovered as an enhancement of something

241
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,000
in algebraic topology, since Dr. Wolfram brings up Alexander growth and deke. In algebraic topology,

242
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,960
we have a theory called boredism, which is an extraordinary homology theory, and quantum field

243
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:24,160
theory would be discovered in enhancing boredism theory, as Ed Whitten, Michael Atiyah, and Graham

244
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:29,760
Siegel and others taught us in the 1980s. Having seen revolutions, yes, there are things that you

245
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:37,040
can tell people where they're never the same again. They come to understand, as I've said before,

246
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:42,640
there should be a tattoo on all of our cecums. If you can read this, you're too close. When you

247
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:50,000
pull your head out, you can better understand the world after the revolution. And what Dr.

248
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:57,360
Wolfram is discussing is that we've had a small number of complete revolutions in our thinking,

249
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:03,360
and many more minor elaborations in our thinking. There was one around scale, which might be called

250
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:09,280
the first and second renormalization revolutions, originally a Feynman and Schwinger, but then

251
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:14,560
Ken Wilson really was probably the big name in that area. Having been through a few of these

252
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:19,520
revolutions, having been close enough to study them, and also in a few different fields like

253
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:24,800
biology with, you know, CRISPR-Cas9 or optogenetics or something like this, yeah, no, these things

254
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:32,080
are real. And they change everything. And, you know, my resistance to Stephen's theory will one day

255
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:36,720
turn into, you know, my saying, oh, my God, I can't believe I didn't understand what you were

256
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:42,320
saying. It was too new to use Feynman's famous quote from when he tried to introduce his path

257
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:47,440
integral or path sum over history's approach. He said, my machines came from too far away,

258
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,520
because he was derided. And you see a lot of people, we were talking before about Reddit,

259
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,840
just to close this out. A lot of people are trying to figure out what the hell is going on in these

260
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:00,240
live streams, and why does one person get to be in them, and who's a crank, and who isn't.

261
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:05,200
They're trying to use some sort of indicia, which is, does that person sound like their wild eye?

262
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,760
Does that person sound sober? And it's a really odd moment, because on the one hand,

263
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:14,880
everybody sounds crazy, and some of the crazy people sound among the most sane. And I think Dr.

264
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,760
Wolfern, for example, despite the fact that I think he's wrong, I think that he is one of the

265
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:25,360
sanest voices out here, one of the most interesting for sure. And part of the problem is the mainstream

266
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:30,560
of the community sounds mad as a hatter to me, and Dr. Wolfern sounds much more reasonable.

267
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:35,840
So let's comment on paradigm shifts and so on. I've been fortunate to live through some myself,

268
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,320
even probably responsible for some. The main process that seems to happen is,

269
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:46,720
a methodological advance is made, that opens up some new area, there's a bunch of low hanging

270
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:51,040
fruit to be picked in that area. Lots of exciting stuff happens for five years,

271
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:57,840
10 years, maybe a little bit longer. That area of science gets big, it gets quite institutionalized,

272
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:03,200
it slows down, there's 50 or 100 years of sort of stasis, and then maybe there's some methodological

273
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:09,520
advance and it opens up again. And typically, in terms of sort of the conceptualization of

274
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:15,520
these methodological advances, it's usually a long process for the people involved in them,

275
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,600
and it's usually, you know, you have to sort of think about things in the right way,

276
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:24,160
and then maybe there's some moment when you realize, yes, I can actually see how this works. Now,

277
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:29,360
for example, in my current activities in physics, you know, one of the embarrassments of that is

278
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:34,720
that the fundamental model, which is based on, you can think of it as based on rewritings of

279
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:42,800
hypergraphs or very minimalist, very sort of abstract thing about transformations for relations

280
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:50,160
between elements. And that idea you can also think of as transformation rules for symbolic

281
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:55,360
expressions. Well, the idea of transformation rules for symbolic expressions is what I've been

282
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:01,920
using technologically in building computational languages for 40 years. And it is super embarrassing,

283
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:07,760
in a sense, that the core idea, which seems to have unlocked what we're doing now in physics,

284
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:12,000
is actually something that I've been working on for 40 years. But I didn't see that connection,

285
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:18,080
I mean, what's happened is that normally, in using symbolic expressions and transformation

286
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:22,160
rules for symbolic expressions in computational languages, those symbolic expressions actually

287
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:28,800
immediately mean something. They mean, you know, adding things together, they mean, I don't know,

288
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:34,960
some other identifiable kind of operation. Whereas in the way we're using them in physics,

289
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,840
it's just the infrastructure, they mean nothing. They get meaning because the things in them turn

290
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:45,360
into the things like the atoms of space and so on. But to begin with, they mean nothing. So for me,

291
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:49,840
that's sort of an interesting case, because it's something which has been right under my nose for

292
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:55,920
40 years. And it took that amount of time for me to have the right sort of conceptual framework

293
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:01,200
to see how it could be applied in this particular case. And, you know, I think that's, I mean,

294
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:07,120
this is a question of kind of how people, you know, how these paradigm shifts and so on,

295
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:12,720
kind of land in the world. I mean, okay, so there's one big one that I've been deeply involved in,

296
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:19,360
which is the whole idea of using computation and programs as models of the world, instead of using

297
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:24,880
mathematical equations as models of the world. So you roll the clock back, you know, 300 or so

298
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:31,200
years, we get to Galileo and Newton and so on. And they had the problem of explaining to people,

299
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,080
no, you can't just reason about how the world works, you can write down a mathematical equation

300
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:41,840
and solve it and that will tell you how the moon moves or something. And, you know, at that time,

301
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,360
it was a sort of complicated battle to have people realize, yes, you can just, you know,

302
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,960
solve the mathematical equation, it will tell you how the world works. It's not a question of

303
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:56,960
reasoning about it. Okay, 300 years go by. And then we're at the point where, oh, mathematical

304
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,280
equations are the way the world works. Is there some other way to describe how the world works?

305
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:05,200
No, no, no, they can't possibly be another way to describe how the world works. You know,

306
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:10,800
when I started thinking about kind of generalizing sort of rules for how the world works and

307
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,800
thinking about simple programs and what they do and kind of exploring the computational

308
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:18,240
universe of simple programs, I would say, actually, looking back on it's interesting,

309
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:23,520
you know, I published this big book called a new kind of science back in 2002. I would say that

310
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:28,720
many fields were really quite receptive to what I had to say. Fundamental physics was actually one

311
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,200
of the one of the only exceptions. What was interesting there was, you know, some people said,

312
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,800
oh, you know, programs, we don't need programs to describe the world, mathematical equations

313
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:43,200
do just fine. Okay, now you look just maybe 15 years later. And if you look at new models that

314
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:48,000
people are inventing of things, they are overwhelmingly based on programs, not based on

315
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,800
mathematical equations. There's a dark story underneath this, which is that as tech has been

316
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:58,000
really the, and by tech, I really mean computation, because most of the rest of technology seems to

317
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:04,560
have vanished as computation became the one bright spot in a relatively stagnant world.

318
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:10,320
And I hate to say it that way. There are caveats, but let's let's keep going.

319
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:18,160
It came to be that many people started to dress up whatever they were doing in terms of computation,

320
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:24,160
right, because it was possible to seek, you know, funding from a Yuri Milner or a Mark Zuckerberg,

321
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:28,160
or, dare I say, a Jeffrey Epstein, you know, all of these sorts of things,

322
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:36,000
which had exotic funding sources or possible prizes around them in computation. It also

323
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,960
became the case that funders were more eager at the government level to hear a proposal for

324
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:46,240
something having a computational nature. So the problem that we have is, is that there were all

325
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:53,440
of these old ideas about, you know, of anointment, of Schrodinger, of Hawking, etc., etc., touring

326
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:00,080
about the world as a computer. And at the moment, there's a system of selective pressures that

327
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:05,200
partially has to do with how difficult it is to fund one's research. So I don't want, I'm very

328
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:10,240
worried about the event horizon of the computational paradigm. It's absolutely true what Stephen is

329
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:16,160
saying, that this is torn through theoretical physics, but I'm very dubious as I was.

330
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:19,280
No, it hasn't. No, it hasn't. Not theoretical physics. No, it hasn't.

331
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:25,120
The people aren't necessarily doing what you're saying, but they are dressing things up in terms

332
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:31,520
of computation. So I think your interesting points, I think not quite right. Okay, so you're

333
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:35,280
absolutely right that in theoretical physics, for example, quantum computing has become this

334
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,880
giant, you know, a fundable thing. We can talk about that separately.

335
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:44,000
Or black hole information paradoxes, or the idea of the universe as a computer, John Wheeler had

336
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,600
old points, but that feel. But that's not what I'm talking about. That's not what I'm talking about.

337
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:54,240
What I'm talking about is, there is a way of thinking about doing science that says,

338
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,960
you write down an equation, you can solve this equation, and it will tell you how the world

339
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,600
is going to work. Computational scientific material is sort of the old line of reductionism,

340
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,680
which is if we could just solve these equations, we get beautiful, closed-form solutions.

341
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:15,520
The surprising thing that, you know, I really got serious about in the 1980s was this phenomenon

342
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:21,520
where if what you think is going on is that it's just following computational rules,

343
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:26,240
then that doesn't work anymore. There's this phenomenon of computational irreducibility

344
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:31,120
where the system is doing what it does, and it's doing a computation, and we're trying to figure

345
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:35,680
out what the system does, and we're also doing a computation, and there's this thing I call the

346
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:40,400
principle of computational equivalence, which is basically the statement or the claim, which we're

347
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:45,680
getting more and more evidence for, that our ability to think through what a system does

348
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:50,480
is of the same level of computational sophistication as what the system itself does.

349
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:56,080
So we never get to outrun the system. We don't get to do what has been the kind of banner story

350
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:02,240
of a lot of traditional mathematical science, which is find this reduction, this reducible

351
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:07,520
computation where we can just say, and the system is going to do this. We're kind of stuck.

352
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:11,840
There's the issue about whether we can compute it out once we find the rules.

353
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:16,480
So the idea is that you could imagine a world in which Maxwell's equations are perfect, you know,

354
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:22,400
all the way down, and you still might not be able to compute the consequences of Maxwell's equations

355
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:28,000
like the Einstein equations like Navier-Stokes. It happens, but it's very obscure in those

356
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,560
equations, because when you look at the Navier-Stokes equations, the standard equations for fluid

357
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:38,560
flow, one of the most notable features of fluid flow is fluid turbulence. Fluid flows quickly,

358
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:43,760
it looks kind of random. You say to people who study the Navier-Stokes equations, can you reproduce

359
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,600
that from the underlying equations? Is that something that's in the underlying equations,

360
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:52,160
or is it maybe a sign of some, you know, smaller scale molecular processes that are

361
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:56,640
getting amplified, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera? So they'll typically get, I mean, these days they

362
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:01,120
have a lot of empirical ways to do it, but if you really push on the fundamental question,

363
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,280
they'll get kind of embarrassed because they just don't know.

364
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:07,760
It's like quark confinement. If you know the rules of quarks, can you prove that they're

365
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:12,400
not never going to be found in isolation and only going to be found typically in hadrons?

366
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:19,360
Yeah, that's a similar thing, which actually has, that particular one actually has a more

367
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:25,120
direct story of... Let's all agree that we're modern people and we don't have the old reductionist

368
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:31,120
dream. That's a non-trivial point because in theoretical physics, that point has not yet been

369
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:36,400
understood. Well, I think it has. I think that the extent to which we talk about what is emergent,

370
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:42,640
what is not, what is enthropic, what is not, we now have many concepts, including, you know,

371
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:48,240
galois sorts of, not galois, girdle sorts of concerns that are cropping up in theoretical

372
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:53,280
physics. Finally, yes. I wrote the paper about undersideability in theoretical physics back

373
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:58,880
in the early 1980s. I think it needs to be said, you know, again, by somebody who hopes to be your

374
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:04,240
competitor, that you were very early on a lot of these topics. You weren't doing it as part of a

375
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:09,040
fad. You were in fact the pioneer coming out of the computational ability of mathematics and all

376
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:13,920
that you've set up. And you've wrapped some beautiful libraries with many more functions than

377
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:19,440
anybody ever thought we could have. So, you know, kudos to you. There was a huge resistance inside

378
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:25,120
of theoretical physics because it was a very closed, arrogant community. It had many reasons to be

379
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:32,400
arrogant. It has fewer reasons to be arrogant now. And so in part, I think that you were dismissed

380
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:37,280
unfairly. It's very important that you not be the one to blow your own horn. So I would be happy

381
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:42,560
to say that I remember when that book came out, I remember the derision, the anger didn't seem to

382
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:49,600
come from anywhere in particular. And it was not listened to properly, even though I don't think

383
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:56,160
that it actually is doing what you say it's doing now. But one, happy to be wrong. And it was always

384
00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:00,560
a really important point that you were making within that. I just don't think that it really

385
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,880
hurt. What do you make of that, Steven? Hold on a second. I want to just correct that impression.

386
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:12,480
Because the fact is, you know, I was looking at this recently, right? Insofar as there was

387
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:17,920
negativism about that book, where did it actually come from? Because there was tons of positivism.

388
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:25,600
I mean, the negativism, it turns out, was specifically concentrated in people who did

389
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:32,640
fundamental physics. And if you look outside of that area, it was not negativism, it was actually

390
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:37,680
a lot of positivism. But to steal man the critics, which I hate to do, the critics have a feeling

391
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:43,360
that there's a tiny number of fields where it's very difficult to check people. It's very hard to

392
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:49,120
say when a theoretical physicist is bullshitting. It's very hard to say when a theoretical, very pure

393
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:56,880
mathematician is speaking nonsense. So there is this fear. How do we know that what he's saying

394
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:02,000
in some sense is correct? Correct enough to interrupt, but correct enough to devote

395
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,640
many precious hours to unravel it. There's that, but there's not that much to unravel

396
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:10,240
at the moment. So I'm not that sympathetic with that. You know, this is sort of Sabine. I don't

397
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:15,120
have time for this stuff. My feeling is, to hell you don't have time. There's almost nothing happening.

398
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:20,800
Now, with that said, what I think is, is that there was a fear that quite honestly people like

399
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:27,280
you and like myself are cheating. And just I want to be open about this. The fear that comes out of

400
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:32,720
whatever is left of the core community is you guys don't have a right to go direct to a consumer.

401
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:38,800
You don't have a right to talk about the field that belongs to a tiny, the privilege of a tiny

402
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:43,680
number of people who do this morning, noon and night, who are all possessed of common beliefs.

403
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,920
And that's something that both you and I have been fighting. Now, I would also suggest that

404
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:54,480
Stephen and I probably are not eager to open the door to every lunatic with a red crayon who

405
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:59,520
wants to scribble something on a roll of paper towels and say that they've got a unified theory.

406
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:04,240
So there have to be some standards. On the other hand, the core group that's been trying to gate

407
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:10,800
this has failed. It was historically interesting to me. So I was, you know, I did particle physics

408
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:16,240
during its kind of golden age in the late 1970s when I was a late teenager, so to speak.

409
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:22,960
And I think I did pretty well. You know, a bunch of I got, you know, got was was sort of pretty

410
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:27,440
successful in the field. And I wrote a bunch of papers that still get cited because I lived in

411
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:32,240
the sort of golden age and not a lot came after that. I mean, not because they were necessarily,

412
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,720
you know, there was a question of picking low hanging fruit. And so that meant that I

413
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:41,840
know a large fraction of the kind of leading people in theoretical physics above some age.

414
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:49,120
I was quite surprised by the level of kind of angst when new kind of science came out.

415
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:53,920
But the typical thing that I heard was, oh, my gosh, if this is right, what we've been doing for

416
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,400
the last 50 years, all has to be thrown away. And I kept on saying, I don't think that's what's

417
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:04,320
going to happen. You know, and people would say to me like, you know, I was I was noticing, I think

418
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,320
I made a you know, wrote a sort of historical piece about this. And I described it as

419
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:13,440
Nobel Prize winners with pitchforks. And so there was a was a quite a parade. It was quite it's

420
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,600
quite kind of interesting looking back on it. I was going to send one of them an email actually,

421
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:22,240
just when my new thing came out. And then the person went and died. So they die or they soften.

422
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:28,000
I think what was interesting to me was at that time, 20 years ago, there was a lot of kind of,

423
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:33,040
you know, we're going to make it string theory is going to do it. We're almost there. You know,

424
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,480
we don't need anything else. I think that's changed now.

425
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,880
That's about 1984 through 86, when the string mania was at its height.

426
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:47,760
No, I think that, you know, now, you know, we've got a lot of mostly younger physicists

427
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:53,200
who are pretty seriously working on this stuff. And I think, you know, it's it's going great.

428
00:38:53,760 --> 00:39:00,640
Of the older crowd, you know, I sort of been in contact with a large fraction of them. And it's

429
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:05,040
like, Oh, this seems interesting. And it's like, you should actually work on this. I keep on telling

430
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:09,200
him you should actually work on it. And some of them have, you know, been on live streams,

431
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,480
we've done and things like that. And we certainly talked about things. But I think,

432
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:17,040
you know, a lot of people, they do something for a living. And this isn't what they do for a living.

433
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:21,920
And I don't know whether they'll kind of make the effort to kind of turn what the change what

434
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:26,960
they do for a living. I don't know whether it matters. I think that the the concept that,

435
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:32,880
you know, it is probably particularly 20 years ago, it was still the case that the kind of

436
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:38,240
institutional structure of things like physics was very strong. As in, it was like, we have

437
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:42,720
this institutional structure, and this is how this field is going to work. And we don't do anything

438
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:47,040
from the outside. My impression is that that's weakened in the intervening years. But maybe

439
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:53,680
I'm wrong. The perception that I get from comments from people is almost like being

440
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:59,200
candid with both of you as friends. On one hand, Eric is criticized for a complexity,

441
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:07,040
a technical, you know, sort of toolkit that is beyond even many theoretical physicists. So,

442
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:11,040
you know, I disagree that, you know, they'll say, I don't have enough time, but but it is true that

443
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:16,320
there's, you know, general stock and trade of a theoretical cosmologist is not necessarily

444
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:21,360
hop vibrations, fiber bundles, etc. It might be perturbation theory, it might be quantum field

445
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:27,840
theory. And on the other side of the coin, Steven, I think sometimes the perception is it's too

446
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:33,440
simplistic, not in the sense or it's too elementary. It's too fundamental in the sense that you use

447
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:37,520
in your in your wonderful new book, which you're kind of enough to send to me. And congratulations

448
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:42,320
for writing a shorter book than a new kind of science, I think by about 40 pages. Brian gets a

449
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:47,200
copy. I think Steven will send you one or I'll give you one when we get together. I've got multiple

450
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:52,960
copies. But Steven, you know, so let me let me just start with with you for a second. Eric knows

451
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,720
his critics, he knows what people say, and I think he brings up a good point. Wait, I have

452
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:01,280
critics, this is the first I hear of this, Brian. There's two, one's named Pia something and the

453
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:06,640
other one. But Steven, in your case, I think it's absolutely correct that, you know, people are

454
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:11,680
blown away by the contributions. I have people, you know, asking me to thank you from the depths

455
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:17,680
of their heart for for Mathematica for new kind of science that in some ways, it's amazing that

456
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:22,560
you guys have, I get comments, I'm reading them, you save my life, you touch my life, you change

457
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:28,560
my life. It's so amazing. But on the other hand, I think that that in in real scientific circles,

458
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:35,040
oftentimes breeds a class of almost undermining and let me explain something which is which I

459
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:42,800
think is interesting. So I am that people think what I've done is simplistic is a great compliment

460
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:47,840
because I've spent a huge amount of effort trying to take the things that I'm thinking about and

461
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:52,880
make them simple enough that both I can understand them well, and I can explain them well. When I

462
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:58,240
wrote new kind of science, I even said this in the introduction, I said, the fact that this appears

463
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:04,240
to be very simple, appears to be very straightforward, will make people who thought, you know, who work

464
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:09,760
on technical science think that, you know, they must, they must really understand this and this

465
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:15,760
must be something simple and irrelevant. It isn't true. You know, the fact is, it is, it is much

466
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:20,400
more difficult, at least for me, maybe it isn't for everybody, but I think it probably is for

467
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:26,240
almost everybody, to turn things into things that can be described simply than it is to kind of,

468
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:30,800
you know, maybe there's a certain challenge to sort of building up the tower of being able to

469
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:36,240
talk about, you know, fiber bundles and self-dual connections and all this kind of thing, but,

470
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:41,600
but that's a, it's a well-defined tower you have to climb. So, for example, right now, I happen to

471
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:47,120
be working on kind of a very bizarre thing that, again, I never thought would come out, which is

472
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:54,160
a kind of a, a general theory of metamathematics. So in mathematics, one, one thinks about, you

473
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,760
know, there's the particular mathematics people do, the three million theorems of mathematics

474
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:02,000
that have been published in the literature of mathematics and human history, but then there's

475
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,440
the kind of full metamathematics of all possible theorems. And the remarkable thing is that it

476
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:12,880
looks like we can actually derive kind of the analog of Einstein's equations in metamathematical

477
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:20,400
space, a very bizarre. We keep coming to this point. I want to just put a pin here just in case

478
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:30,560
it's of interest. I don't think that it's very difficult to imagine recovering Einstein's equations

479
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:36,160
given Hilbert's contribution so that we know in a weird sense that Einstein did something very,

480
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:41,200
very difficult. And I've compared it to Half Dome where there's a sheer face that Einstein went up,

481
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:45,440
and then there's this gentle face that Hilbert went up after he knew that it could be climbed.

482
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:50,640
It seems to me that because we know that Einstein's equations results from the simplest

483
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:56,000
objective function that you could have, which is the scalar curvature in Rouhani and geometry,

484
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,840
that that's not a great target. I mean, it's great that you can produce something that looks like

485
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:08,480
Einstein's theory out of computational rules. The next one on the list would be Yang-Mills

486
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:18,000
theory. They're only really four basic equations. Again, the objective function is as simple as

487
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:25,440
it gets. So to Stephen's point, what we know about the current physical world is that two out of the

488
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:31,040
four equations, fundamental equations for the fields, the things that dance in our world and we call

489
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:36,640
particles or waves, both of those come from the simplest possible curvature equations that one

490
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:41,360
can have in geometry. So if you think of the geometries largely about curvature, then the two

491
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:46,880
simplest structures that can generate equations called the Yang-Mills Lagrangian or the Yang-Mills

492
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:52,480
Maxwell Lagrangian, which is just you take the size of the curvature and you square it and that's

493
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:57,840
it. And the other one is you just take a piece of the curvature without squaring it when you have

494
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:02,160
a piece to take called the scalar curvature and that's it. The other two equations have a slightly

495
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:08,640
different character. I want to leave aside the Higgs field and what we would call the Klein-Gordon

496
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:14,960
equation with the potential. But I would say the next order of business is do you find the Dirac

497
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:23,360
equation? Because it's very difficult to find spinners arising from computational rules.

498
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:32,640
So the answer is do we know how we managed to get spinner representations in the rotation group?

499
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:38,160
We know how to construct these things. There is a mystery about why they are there to construct.

500
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:42,320
Now there are people who will go to their graves saying there is no mystery, I know how to construct

501
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:47,760
it, therefore I know what it is, which is never true. I mean we only really understand something

502
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,600
in mathematics when we can walk all around it and see it from many different angles.

503
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:57,680
I agree that we know how to construct spinners, I know how to construct Dirac operators,

504
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:03,840
but this is a highly non-trivial question in our world. It comes out of what I call the psychedelic

505
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:08,960
of mathematics, the square root construction, where you ask a question like what is x squared

506
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:14,480
equals minus one? It has no solution in the reels. You have to jump into another space

507
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:20,960
in order to answer the question. So it has this different character which is the answer to the

508
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:27,600
problem isn't found in the space in which the problem was posed. In the case of Einstein's

509
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:31,840
equations and in the Yang-Mills equations or the souped up version of Maxwell's equations,

510
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:39,120
non-linear Maxwell theory if you will, you have something which has a character where I understand

511
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:43,760
where it comes from. In the case of the Dirac equation, you have got much bigger problems.

512
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:49,520
I tried to bring this up in the last live stream, it didn't work at all. What do you do in quantum

513
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:57,760
gravity when you don't have an observation of the metric, for example, and therefore you cannot

514
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:03,920
construct the ocean in which the electron is a wave? Now, if you think about it very carefully,

515
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:10,720
in a weird way, electrons are basically functions and photons are basically derivative operators.

516
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:18,320
That's a bizarre way to think about it. I know the mathematical physics, so I understand what

517
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:24,160
you're talking about. Then you wouldn't say it's a bizarre way at all, I don't think in any event.

518
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:29,840
What we're talking about is we're talking about versions of the xy plane and functions and

519
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:35,760
derivatives. The idea of the xy plane that grows up to become something called fiber bundles which

520
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:40,880
Stephen mentioned at the beginning. The idea of functions grows up to be something called sections

521
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:46,720
and the idea of derivatives grows up to be something called connections. These are the basic bread and

522
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:53,200
butter of what goes on before you get to the quantum. In that picture, there's a big difference

523
00:47:53,200 --> 00:48:00,400
between recovering the easiest bits and recovering the hardest bits. I don't mean to put extra weight

524
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:08,160
on Stephen's shoulders. If he can do the first bits, that's great, but there's a series of challenges

525
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:14,640
that are of escalating difficulty in terms of recovery because of the simplicity of some portions

526
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:19,040
of our model and the Baroque complexity of other portions of the model. For example, the internal

527
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:23,600
quantum number assignments that give the particles their personality, the number of generations,

528
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:31,280
the chirality of the situation. It's very interesting. Stephen's rules are going to have to pick a left

529
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:36,240
or a right, so it's very interesting to how he's going to recover a chiral world.

530
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:44,000
This is silly. Let me give you my point of view here. We can talk about details of mathematical

531
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:50,320
physics. It's quite interesting. I know you know a bunch about it. We can go deeply into

532
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:59,920
how half-interjust spin versus interjusting particles work, etc. What you're doing is you're

533
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:07,040
making the paradigm shift mistake. You're talking about things in terms of existing mathematical

534
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:12,480
physics ideas. Yes, you're saying, oh my gosh, you'll never be able to get spinners.

535
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:18,720
No, I'm just saying let me just make a few points about this. Okay, I mean the fact is

536
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:25,680
we're actually hot on the trail of understanding how fermions versus bosons work. It's quite

537
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:33,520
interesting. It has to do, it seems, with cases where in our, and again, it's sort of a somewhat

538
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:40,240
complicated story, but it's these branch pairs and branch shield space, whether they end up being

539
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:46,560
things that merge after a small number of steps or not, seems to be what is the distinguishing

540
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:51,360
feature between bosons and fermions, how that relates to half-interjust spin. We don't completely

541
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:56,640
know. It seems to be related to various features of homotopy in the multi-way causal graph.

542
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:02,160
It's quite possible that some of the kinds of mathematical physics that you like a lot are

543
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:07,920
highly relevant in understanding how that homotopy works in the multi-way causal graph. It looks like

544
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:12,640
a limit of the multi-way causal graph is quite possibly related to Twister theory,

545
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:18,240
and that one can understand some of the things that happen there on the basis of Twister theory,

546
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:22,960
whether we can get, we're now understood, we've understood quite a bit about how rotational

547
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:28,720
invariance works, how angular momentum works, but it's kind of a weird business because in a

548
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:35,280
sense, we're trying to build from the machine code up. We can have a detailed mathematical

549
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:40,560
physics conversation. That's what most people are interested in. Oh, I disagree. I think that

550
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:46,640
people actually want to see whether or not, you know, both of us are saying outlandish things.

551
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:51,840
By the way, I don't think what I was saying was silly at all. It started mathematical physics.

552
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:56,000
I think it's all started mathematical physics. I'm going to invoke my referee. I'm going to

553
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,320
hold on. Hold on one second. I do want to point something out. I think it's very important. I've

554
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:04,960
heard this from people that I hold in high esteem, Paul Steinhart. One reason that Paul

555
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:12,080
says he refuses to ever get a Facebook or Twitter account is because he would invariably be tempted

556
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:18,240
to propose an interesting idea, which by necessity would be new, novel, untested, unproven at some

557
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:25,200
level. And then immediately it would be attacked, assailed, subjugated to constraints and concerns.

558
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:30,960
And I think you guys have both seen that for the following reason, that you both are master

559
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:36,960
explicators of what you do. You both are obviously domain experts in what you know and you understand

560
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:41,760
the other branches of physics and mathematics that are pertinent to it. However, neither one

561
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:47,920
really knows the intimacy of the other one's theories. And I think it's important to realize

562
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:54,240
that just like people assailing your theories from without, I think it's too soon to tell,

563
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:59,600
at least in the case of Stephen's work, which is, you know, in some sense, 20 years old or

564
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:04,640
coming up on 20 years old. And in some sense, it's also brand new, because I think when you look

565
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:08,320
at the successful applications, I feel like we should just check those off, Stephen. I mean,

566
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:13,920
biological systems, crystallography, you go down the list, finance, economics, where the

567
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:21,200
Wolfram approach, the new kind of science approach first outlined in 2003 or so, that has already

568
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:25,200
been proven. It doesn't need to be proven. Where I think it's different is where we lay on this extra

569
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:31,120
layer of computability as a fundamental nature of the universe, which for my perception, maybe

570
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:36,480
Stephen, correct me if I'm wrong, has sort of a multiverse component to it. You talk about

571
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:42,320
different aspects of the universe. Well, you talk in an essay that you wrote in 2017 about,

572
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:46,960
you know, the space of all universes where these rules... That was before I understood what I now

573
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:52,320
understand. Yeah. So, but we are barely coming up to where you were in 2017. So, can we take a step

574
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:58,640
back? We talked about the paradigm issue. I want to talk a little bit more about how these ideas get

575
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:03,520
into the firmament or get into the zeitgeist. Yeah, before you do that, I want to just clear

576
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:12,560
something up. Stephen, I'm not trying to scuttle your theory. I believe that your theory, if you

577
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:19,200
have an approach that works and it's a face up the same mountain, my belief is that you will get

578
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:23,360
to answer these questions. You may tell us for the first time, spiritually, what a spinner is

579
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:29,840
from a computational perspective. I'm not saying you've only done the easy stuff and the other

580
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:34,560
stuff is really hard. The stuff that you're talking about is really hard. What's going to pick out

581
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:39,760
the Riemann curvature tensor? How are you going to generate this? Great. That one's fairly easy.

582
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:44,000
Well, I believe that because it's very natural. There's a reason that in some sense it came first

583
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:50,640
before the Wu Yang dictionary. I think spinners are going to come out as the latest thing,

584
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:55,440
which is only a week old. So it's still uncooked. So we're tricking him to sharing this on the

585
00:53:55,440 --> 00:54:00,560
live stream. It's exclusive. This is very good here. Well, we probably talked about it on how

586
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:06,320
working session live streams. But first point is in our models, quantum mechanics is a very natural

587
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:12,880
thing. When we think about traditional classical mechanics, it's like you throw a ball, it goes

588
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:20,160
in a definite direction. In quantum mechanics, the idea is that the ball tests out all possible

589
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:25,760
paths and then we only get to see various probabilities about what happens. In our models,

590
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:30,880
there are these things called multi-way systems, which basically are enumerating all the possible

591
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:37,840
paths. And the whole dynamics of how quantum mechanics works comes out of these multi-way

592
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:44,240
systems. Now, what happens is when you look at one of these multi-way systems at a particular time,

593
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:47,600
you take a slice through it and you get this thing we call branch shield space.

594
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:54,400
Branch shield space is the analog in the space of quantum states to physical space in kind of

595
00:54:54,400 --> 00:55:00,080
ordinary position in the universe. By physical space, you mean a space like hyperspace?

596
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:05,200
These branch shield surfaces are the analog that branch like hypersurfaces, which are the analog

597
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:11,360
of space like hypersurfaces in standard spacetime. So this branch like hypersurface in branch

598
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:16,560
shield space, there's an extent in branch shield space, which is where as you move through branch

599
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:21,440
shield space, you're moving through the space of quantum entanglements. And so states that are

600
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:25,840
further away in branch shield space are less quantum entangled than states which are close

601
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:30,160
in branch shield space. What is your notion of a distance? Well, it's based on, if you look at

602
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:36,240
the multi-way graph, the nearest neighbors in branch shield space are things which have a common

603
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:42,480
ancestor one step back in the multi-way graph. So those are what we call branch pairs. I mean,

604
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:46,320
this is, unfortunately, it gets fairly... I appreciate that, but the idea is you have some

605
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:52,400
ordering by number of steps. Metric, yes. Metric like. It's based on sort of common ancestry in

606
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:59,200
the multi-way graph. And essentially what happens is, well, that thing on the left is a multi-way

607
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:04,720
causal graph. The thing on the right is a kind of play version of a kind of mixture of branch

608
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:10,240
shield space and physical space. Probably not the best visualization, but it's something. But

609
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:15,920
anyway, so the idea is there's physical space that we're all familiar with. There's this branch

610
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:21,120
shield space, which is the kind of space of quantum states, just like there's a speed of light

611
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:25,920
in physical space. In our model, there's a maximum entanglement speed in branch shield

612
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:31,040
space, which is kind of the maximum speed at which kind of you can... maximum speed of kind

613
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:37,360
of entanglement in that space. So, okay. Why is any of this relevant? Again, this is... I'm

614
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:43,920
in the Einstein equations, which have to do with physical space. One is looking at,

615
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:48,560
in the one way to view the Einstein equations, is to think about what happens to a GDC, what

616
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:53,360
happens to the path of a particle in spacetime. Essentially, what's happening in the Einstein

617
00:56:53,360 --> 00:57:03,440
equations is that energy momentum causes deflections in GD6 in spacetime. In a branch

618
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:10,160
shield space, the exact same thing happens. Essentially, energy momentum causes deflections

619
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:17,040
in GD6 in branch shield space. And it turns out that that deflection process gives one the Feynman

620
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:22,560
path integral, which is really cool. And it's one of the things that I sort of found the most

621
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:28,640
elegant in the things that we've done so far in this theory, that what in physical space is

622
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:33,920
the Einstein equations in branch shield space is the path integral. Okay. Why is this relevant to

623
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:39,280
fermions and bosons? The reason it's relevant is that... Wait, wait. I just want to take a moment

624
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:45,360
to think about what you just said. You said that something in general relativity, that is Einstein's

625
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:53,840
equations, which are maximally resistant of all of our structures to quantization, is analogous,

626
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:59,680
in some ways, to the Feynman path integral, which I'm going to disagree later with your

627
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:04,160
characterization, which is Feynman's sort of characterization, the linguistic description

628
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:09,520
of what we claim is happening when we're taking one of these integrals. But the point is, is that

629
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:15,600
you're just making a claim on Poisson, which is astounding to begin with, if true. Which is that

630
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:24,000
the Einstein equations are somehow intimately bound up in the quintessential centerpiece of

631
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:31,280
quantum field theory, not even quantum mechanics. The Einstein equations... I mean,

632
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:38,720
this is a remarkable thing, which I certainly did not see coming, that the path integral is the exact

633
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:42,640
same thing as the Einstein equations, but in a different kind of space. Never heard this. Right.

634
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:46,880
So that's one of the things that we discovered like, I don't know, six, seven months ago,

635
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:52,160
that was like, wow. And those two things meet up when you think about black holes and black hole

636
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:56,560
information and so on. There's sort of this... And in fact, the ADS-CFT correspondence is almost

637
00:58:56,560 --> 00:59:03,040
certainly taking this multi-way causal graph and projecting it into spacetime and projecting it

638
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:08,080
into branchial space. That it's the same graph projected in two different ways, corresponds

639
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:13,600
to the kind of general relativity ADS side of ADS-CFT and the quantum field theory CFT side of

640
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:18,320
it. That's almost certainly what that is. And various people are working on filling in the

641
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:23,760
details of that. It's pretty neat. So then, okay, you asked about fermions and bosons,

642
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:28,800
and I was going to tell you this week's kind of way of getting to that. And these are complicated

643
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:34,960
things. So it takes a few steps. Okay. So the next thing to realize is in quantum mechanics,

644
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:40,560
one of the things that emerged particularly from von Neumann's work was this idea of, there is an

645
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:46,800
amplitude. It is a complex number. It operates in Hilbert space, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

646
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:50,880
One of the things that was implicitly done was something which I think turns out to be a mistake,

647
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:58,720
which is that the magnitude and the phase of these quantum amplitudes were sort of all packaged

648
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:04,000
together. You mean the projectivization of a Hilbert space? Yes. Yes. Well, the fact that

649
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:09,200
the fact that you can think about it as a magnitude and phase is just a complex number.

650
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:17,360
In our models, what ends up happening is the magnitude and the phase come from completely

651
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:22,400
different places. And so what happens is the magnitude has to do with accounting of paths

652
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:26,800
going through this multigraph. The phase has to do with essentially where you land up in

653
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:32,800
branchial space. And actually, one of the things that we figured out about a week or two ago is

654
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:38,560
it's just unbelievably easy to get the double slit experiment to work. And we get nice pictures.

655
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:41,200
Yeah, I don't know what that means. But the first point, if I understand...

656
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:42,800
Oh, no, it's interference in quantum mechanics.

657
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:43,040
Right?

658
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:43,760
I understand that.

659
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:49,120
You mean you don't understand how it's easy. It comes out naturally in some sense.

660
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:53,840
No. What he's saying, I mean, we have to go back and unpack what the good doctor is saying.

661
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:59,040
He is talking about the fact that we claim that we work in a Hilbert space. We don't work in a

662
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:03,600
Hilbert space. We work in something called the projectivization of a Hilbert space.

663
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:09,120
And effectively, that destroys a certain amount of structure. So we begin with something like a

664
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:14,080
vector space. We remove the origin. We pluck it out like the seed out of a cherry. And then we take,

665
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:18,720
you know, all of the sort of meat and we compress it in this particular way. And what Stephen is

666
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:24,400
saying is that that is a loss of information that we teach physicists with their mother's milk,

667
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:29,200
and that this may be, in fact, throwing away information that is actually experimentally

668
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:30,800
much more important.

669
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:36,160
Well, I mean, I think that let's not go off into projective Hilbert space for a minute.

670
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:41,040
You guys never take me anywhere.

671
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:44,640
Buy me to the Hilbert space.

672
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:52,640
All right. The thing that ends up being interesting is the when you think about kind of these,

673
01:01:53,360 --> 01:02:01,200
these, again, this is the kind of the sort of quantum gd6. What ends up happening is the phase

674
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:06,000
of the quantum amplitude is essentially defined by its position in Braunschild space. So you think

675
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:11,360
about these in general relativity, you'd think about, you know, a gd6 is deflected by the presence

676
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:17,200
of mass, you know, it's attracted to some massive object, moves around it, it changes the direction

677
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:24,960
of the gd6 has changed by the presence of mass. Okay. In in Braunschild space, it's the same story.

678
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:30,160
The the the gd6 is deflected by the presence of energy momentum. That presence of energy

679
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:35,360
momentum corresponds to Lagrangian and quantum field theory. And what one is doing is deflecting

680
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:40,880
that gd6, the deflection of the gd6. The interpretation of that is it's changing the

681
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:45,760
phase of the quantum amplitude. It's changing where that gd6 is going to land in Braunschild

682
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:50,400
space, which changes the phase of the quantum amplitude. And amusingly enough, what appears in

683
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:56,640
the Feynman-Path integral is exactly e to the i over h bar times the action integral. The action

684
01:02:56,640 --> 01:03:02,080
integral is the integral in our world of the divergence of causal edges, which corresponds

685
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:06,880
to Lagrangian. There seem to be multiple things going on here. If I can just I do want to invoke

686
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:13,280
my my privilege here being being the moderator. We've covered the first of our six or seven topics

687
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:18,000
in 40 and an hour and 15 minutes. It's clear to me. I just want to finish on bosons for a second.

688
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:22,720
Okay, please. Yeah, please finish up. Let's move to our next, which will be experimental testability.

689
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:30,480
The flavor of of this is that what ends up happening with bosons is this kind of collection

690
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:35,760
in Braunschild space, this this kind of focusing in Braunschild space. And what seems to happen

691
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:40,560
with fermions is a divergence in Braunschild space. And it's, you know, one of the things that

692
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:45,280
I've been always been curious about is why are there only fermions and bosons? Why isn't there

693
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:50,480
lots of, you know, intermediate para statistics and so on. And I think that the answer is that

694
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:55,840
it's going to end up being the case that basically in Braunschild space, things either diverge or

695
01:03:55,840 --> 01:04:00,800
they don't diverge. And that's going to but you know, there's there's much mathematical physics

696
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:05,760
packing that has to go around this. And if I could just take 15 seconds to riff off this.

697
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:10,640
Okay, you have a situation in which the great thing about general relativity, for example,

698
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:16,400
is that all you need is length and angle. And length and angle turns out to amount to a derivative

699
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:20,800
operator, which turns out to have mixed partials that don't commute, you can measure their failure,

700
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:25,600
that's the curvature, you knock it down with linear algebra, and you create grab. It's a miracle.

701
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:30,720
It's fantastic. On the other hand, it's not that surprising that if you have a situation in which

702
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:38,560
you have some notion of like size and perpendicularity, that you can create something like that. For

703
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:42,720
example, you do have something called malinobus distance that you can get out of data, you can

704
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:49,280
treat a covariance matrix like a Ramanian metric, if you will. So there are all sorts of ways in

705
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:54,640
which we already know that they're that the discrete that anything that leads to length and

706
01:04:54,640 --> 01:05:01,120
angle becomes geometric. And I think that, you know, that's both very good for Dr. Wolfram,

707
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:07,120
and it is also just a bit of caution for the rest of us that on the the early part may lead you on

708
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:12,560
because it's a different way of describing length and angle and the consequences, which

709
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:18,800
thanks to both Einstein and Grossman and I guess, Hilbert, we know that all we're looking for in some

710
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:24,480
sense is the most basic consequence of that. It'll be cool to see it come out. And I do

711
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:29,680
believe that you you may likely get fermions out of a question. You may have to ask the question

712
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:33,440
about how to take the square root of something. I'll be astounded if you have fermions without

713
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:41,040
taking a square root. But the key feature, you know, is that you're not that far away from geometry

714
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:44,800
as soon as you're talking about malinobus distance and covariance matrix and data.

715
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:50,640
Okay, so, you know, the one cool thing is that the uncertainty principle in our theory is basically

716
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:57,040
the analog of Riemann curvature in branchial space. So the the non commuting of variables

717
01:05:57,040 --> 01:06:02,320
is just like a non commuting. And in geometric quantization, it is literally the curvature

718
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:08,160
tensor on in the Hamiltonian picture. Absolutely. So by the way, in terms of the square root thing,

719
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:14,320
I have the following guess, okay, that what basically happens in branchial spaces, you have

720
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:20,480
these branch pairs, and they converge. Okay, branch pairs. Next step, they converge. I think

721
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:26,160
that the boson cases, they diverge and they converge. The fermion cases, they diverge and

722
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:31,680
they don't converge. And so in some sense, the square root is being taken by the fact that you

723
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:36,080
are having the the beginning of that diamond, but not the end of the diamond. Sounds like the

724
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:41,360
difference between commutators and anticommutators. Yeah, yeah, it's the it's the it's my my first

725
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:47,200
guess about how that works. And it'll it's I mean, the thing that again, I thought we were going to

726
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:52,480
have to, you know, find actual electrons to be able to distinguish fermions and bosons,

727
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:58,240
it's seeming increasingly likely that we can basically understand fermions in bulk without

728
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:03,760
having to know exactly how particles work. What I want to do now is sort of compare and contrast

729
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:08,960
different approaches, not necessarily only from the two of you. But in the in the context that I

730
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:13,600
often get, well, first of all, the common thing that I get from all my, you know, friends on Reddit

731
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:18,160
or wherever else this gets posted is, you know, how come these things aren't being peer reviewed

732
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:23,360
and what kinds of falsifiable predictions are they making? Let's start with the latter. Steven,

733
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:28,240
you and I talked back in April, and you made it clear that things such as the fundamental

734
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:34,400
constants of nature, the speed of light are emergent or embedded encoded encrypted within

735
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:40,640
within your new findings. I want to know, are there new predictions that could be used instead

736
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:45,040
of retradictions? Not that they don't have validity, not that they don't have a value.

737
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:50,320
After all, Einstein, you know, in some sense validated his his theory on a retradiction,

738
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:53,680
which was known for a million, you know, millions of years. It was known for years,

739
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:58,960
the perihelion advance of the planet Mercury, and it had to be reconciled with with Einstein's

740
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:03,600
predictions. And through observations, it was found to be true. I want to know,

741
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:10,400
Steven, are there new fundamental predictions that you can can point to that have at least,

742
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:14,720
in principle, a chance of being detected? And then I'll have a similar question for Eric.

743
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:22,000
Well, let's see, I don't do the the dueling theories theory, but but yeah, falsifiability is a

744
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:28,640
weird concept that has all kinds of problems. But the fact is, you know, first thing is,

745
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:33,040
the number one thing that we're building is a framework, like calculus.

746
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:39,680
Calculus is not something that's falsifiable. Calculus is a framework for doing things.

747
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:47,920
Second question is, does calculus usefully apply to the universe? That's something we can

748
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:53,360
validly ask. And that's something that, you know, we can, there are things which are sort of generic

749
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:59,440
predictions from the framework. So the thing we're trying to do right now is what people

750
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:04,640
should do when they first introduce some, you know, new set of ideas, which is,

751
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:08,720
can we actually reproduce? Can we make theoretical predictions? Can we reproduce what

752
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:14,880
what what has been known before? And can we get out vastly more than we put in? Yes, we put very

753
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:19,840
little in. And the question is, do we get all these things out? Or do we have to add some special

754
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:25,680
clues to get fermions? Or do fermions come out naturally, as soon as we understand how to get

755
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:30,480
there? And the thing which has been remarkable so far is, you know, we've been checking off,

756
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:37,840
do we get this, do we get that, do we get that? So far, touch wood, no clues. I mean, so far,

757
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:43,120
it's been hard work. But nothing has been like, Oh, my gosh, the universe, you know,

758
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:47,440
the theory predicts the universe should be 26 dimensional, we have to explain why it's not

759
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:52,320
type thing. We haven't had any of those kind of, you know, clues barriers, so to speak.

760
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:57,120
So that's encouraging. Now, in terms of actually making specific, measurable predictions,

761
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:03,680
a couple of issues. First issue is going from the raw theory, the low level machine code,

762
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:07,840
to something where you turn a telescope in that direction, and you see a particular thing.

763
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:12,640
There's lots of, you know, there's lots of hard work and lots of astrophysics and so on to be done

764
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:19,360
in going from one place to another. That's first point. The second point is that to actually make

765
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:25,360
one of the things in our theory is there is one scale. Same happened with Einstein's theory,

766
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:29,920
actually. Although, for various reasons that, well, we can talk about that, but there's one scale,

767
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:35,520
which is this maximum entanglement speed. We don't know what the value of that is. We have

768
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:40,720
some guesses, but we don't know its value. If we knew its value, we would have a whole bunch of

769
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:46,080
predictions immediately. But we don't know its value. Einstein had the same problem. He had the

770
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:50,960
cosmological constant. He didn't know its value. It's, you know, a lot of predictions he might

771
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:54,560
have liked to make. He couldn't make because he didn't know the value of the cosmological constant.

772
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:59,360
You know, he had one meta prediction was that the universe wasn't expanding, he thought,

773
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:04,160
which is why he added his cosmological constant in the first place. But that's his scale. So then

774
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:08,800
he had a few scale independent predictions, in particular, the, you know, the bending of light

775
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:12,640
around the sun being a factor of two larger than I've been predicting the previous theory,

776
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:17,360
things like that. So one thing that we've been interested in is what scale independent predictions

777
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:22,800
can we make? That's question one. And question two, what predictions can we make that are,

778
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:29,200
as soon as we know this one scale, we immediately have predictions. And then which predictions can

779
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:34,240
we make that have the shortest distance in terms of the tower of astrophysics or particle physics

780
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:38,480
or whatever they have to be done. It's a cautionary tale that like Newton, for example, you know,

781
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:43,200
he goes through his whole, you know, Principia, and he works out lots of things about his law of

782
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:48,000
gravity. And he has a section about the moon. And the section about the moon ends with the

783
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:52,400
sentence, I think, but the abs of the moon is twice as great. In other words, he got the wrong

784
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:57,280
answer. And, you know, one might have said, Oh, my gosh, he got the wrong answer, he better abandon

785
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:02,000
the whole theory and run away, so to speak. Turns out it was just hard to do those calculations. It

786
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:07,120
took another 150 years to get them nailed down. So that wasn't, you know, so one has to be a little

787
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:11,440
bit an Einstein also, you know, the first time he computed the bending of light around the sun,

788
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:16,880
he got it wrong. And it was, you know, fortunate, the first, you know, experiment that was going

789
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:22,320
to be done on that didn't end up getting done because of World War One. And so, you know,

790
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:26,080
by the time an experiment did get done, he'd managed to get the right answer, whether the

791
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:30,080
experiment was right, it's a different story. But that's, that's another, another thing. But I

792
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:35,760
think that the so the question of, you know, do we have kind of scale independent predictions?

793
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:41,280
The answer is quite possibly. I think there's one quite likely one that has to do with

794
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:46,000
two photon correlations for photons in orbit around rotating black holes,

795
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:50,000
is a slightly obscure thing, but it's not completely out of the range of what's

796
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:55,120
experimentally accessible. Other, I mean, it's kind of amusing that that's so bizarrely similar,

797
01:12:55,120 --> 01:13:00,640
it's a kind of a quantum analog of Einstein's, you know, bending of light around the sun type thing.

798
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:07,600
But, you know, that's one kind of thing. Another thing is a suggestion, at least from the theory,

799
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:12,480
about the existence of particles much lighter than the electron, maybe 10 to the 20th times

800
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:16,960
lighter than the electron. That number depends on the scale parameter that we don't know.

801
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:20,400
The existence of such particles probably has a bunch of implications for dark matter,

802
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:27,600
which are things that we're planning to work out. There are a bunch of implications for cosmology.

803
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:33,040
I mean, there's an expectation, not a necessary feature, but a suggestion, at least from the model,

804
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:37,520
that the universe starts kind of infinite dimensional and only gradually kind of

805
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:42,720
decay down to the sort of modest three dimensions that we have now. That has a bunch of implications

806
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:47,200
for inflationary scenarios for the universe and so on. You know, I think the most outlandish

807
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:52,320
possibility, which I don't think will actually happen, is that still at the time of recombination,

808
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:58,400
you know, when your cosmic microwave background globe was minted, so to speak, that there would

809
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:04,000
still be a trace of some of the early discrete processes that happened in the very early stages

810
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:07,840
of the universe. I really doubt that it would have survived that long. But if it did, the absolutely

811
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:12,480
outlandish possibility is that the kind of the rule for the universe might be painted in the

812
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:16,960
microwave background radiation, which would be truly wrong. I don't think that would happen.

813
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:21,600
I think it's very unlikely. But, you know, early density perturbations, there might be some things

814
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:28,880
that would be a result of this changing dimensional scenario that's rather different from the traditional

815
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:34,400
exponential expansion and four dimensional space, space time of inflationary cosmology.

816
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:39,440
That's on the one side. On the particle physics side, and well, one of the things is that it's

817
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:46,080
looking very much as if quantum computing at some fundamental level can't work. However,

818
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:52,080
seeing that and seeing the actual effects of our theory for decoherence and things like that,

819
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:58,400
it's not at all clear that the can't work point is something experimentally accessible.

820
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:05,120
And I think that the, you know, it's a question. There's some clever experiment that can be done

821
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:11,600
in quantum computing that could see this maximum entanglement speed. That's basically the,

822
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:15,280
and we don't know what the value of that speed is, so we can't really tell. What estimate that we

823
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:19,680
have of that speed is 10 to the five solar masses per second. If that estimate is correct,

824
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:25,120
then it is possible that in black hole, well, it's possible that we'll make small

825
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:31,440
effect in a black hole merger of, you know, one and a half solar mass type size would have a bigger

826
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:38,480
effect if, you know, two sort of central black holes of two galaxies happen to collide and merge,

827
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:42,720
then there will be a bigger effect. It's also conceivable that there might be an effect when

828
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:48,320
black holes initially form. And this is an astrophysics question for you, Brian. How long does

829
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:54,160
it take a black hole to actually form? Once you have in falling matter, the question is what the

830
01:15:54,160 --> 01:16:00,160
actual weather in 10 to the minus five seconds, something, whether one can tell what's happening

831
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:04,640
in the last 10 to the minus five seconds of the formation of a black hole. If one can,

832
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:08,400
and if our estimate of the maximum entanglement speed is right, then there will probably be

833
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:11,040
differences from the predictions of general relativity for that case.

834
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:17,520
This is a big question, primordial black hole formation, the end of inflation. These are really

835
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:21,360
important questions that, you know, it's good to it's good to hear, especially that you're,

836
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:24,160
you know, providing potential full employment for my graduate students.

837
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:29,200
Yes, there will be lots of work to do in figuring out the consequences of these things. I mean,

838
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:33,760
it's a particularly when we get this kind of way of actually doing computations in general

839
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:38,240
relativity from our model, set up as a piece of practical numerical relativity, and that that

840
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:42,320
will probably happen fairly quickly. We'll actually be able to see a bunch of these effects

841
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:47,120
directly in the computations that we do, but there'll be, you know, just layers of astrophysics

842
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:55,520
to do. And Eric, I want you to sort of opine on this provocative question that I'm being asked

843
01:16:55,520 --> 01:17:02,560
in the chat room. And that is, you know, what of what value is a theory if it is not to be

844
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:06,160
testable, you know, that which can be claimed without evidence can be dismissed without

845
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:10,880
evidence as our friend Christopher Hitchens used to say, I believe. So in the context of

846
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:15,840
geometric unity, I'm not asking you to talk about somebody else's book, but talk, talk your own

847
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:22,000
book for a second. Are there things that are testable by graduate students in my group or other

848
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:26,880
brilliant students around the world? Are there predictions? Are there retradictions that are

849
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:33,120
crisp enough to, to satisfy Popper A? And do you think we should continue to feed Popper as he had

850
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:40,240
enough Pop Pop Pop Popper corn? The first point would be there's a missing layer between you and

851
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:48,080
myself. What we do typically Stephen notwithstanding is is that we come up with a classical model

852
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:52,800
in the form of some sort of geometry. Hopefully it quantizes itself or something like

853
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:59,440
geometric quantization. And then we try to figure out what the testable consequences are in any

854
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:05,960
given energy level through a bunch of phenomenologists, experimentalists, and pure quantum field theorists

855
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:10,080
working hand-in-hand in our harmonious fashion, at least that's the theory.

856
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:14,160
Given that we have a missing layer, there's tons I can say about what's new, what's different,

857
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:17,920
and what my theory says, and effectively what would make it wrong.

858
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:23,480
So I'm happy to get into that because it effectively says that a lot of our standard

859
01:18:23,480 --> 01:18:27,800
verbiage around what we've found is in fact wrong.

860
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:32,520
So for example, standard thing is the world is chiral, the weak force sees the difference

861
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:36,000
between our left hand and our right hand, spiritually speaking.

862
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:40,480
My claim is that the world is not fundamentally chiral, it is emergently chiral, and that

863
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:45,720
in fact it begins in a non-chiral fashion which solves the problem that Sabina does

864
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:50,520
not see, which is what chooses whether it's going to be the left half or the right half

865
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:54,200
effectively that makes up us in some sense.

866
01:18:54,280 --> 01:19:00,040
Can we already know from neutrino masses that we're not seeing a completely chiral situation?

867
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:04,640
We can get into the issue of how to interpret neutrino masses.

868
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:08,640
My claim would be that we have entire sectors that we're not seeing.

869
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:15,960
So for example, unadorned spin one-half bundles that would be tensored with, if you will,

870
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:22,240
the conjugate of the 16-dimensional representation which imparts the particles, their personalities.

871
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:26,360
So that is not something that's seen, and I've analogized it, for those of you watching

872
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:31,680
at home rather than listening, where you have a hand and you see with three fingers in the

873
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:35,880
middle that you think there's a symmetry in the hand, and then you have this problem about

874
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:39,800
how do I make my pinky look like my thumb, and you don't realize that there's an entire

875
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:44,720
other hand and that it's thumb-to-thumb, and pinky-to-pinky, not pinky-to-thumb, it's the

876
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:46,720
symmetry.

877
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:51,280
There is a non-chiral world that is emergently chiral, which is fooling us into thinking it's

878
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:52,320
fundamentally chiral.

879
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:55,480
There are only two generations, not three generations.

880
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:58,920
People will immediately say, well, how do you explain the fact that we've seen the tau

881
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:04,600
particle in the top and bottom works, and the claim is that is not a generation because

882
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:11,120
it will not unify as you heat the soup up in the same way as the first two generations

883
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:12,120
will unify.

884
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:17,280
In fact, it will unify with another collection of particles, also spin one-half, which I

885
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:22,000
believe, if I recall correctly, the thing that will be misinterpreted as an internal

886
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:26,360
representation, I think will be like 112 dimensional rather than 16.

887
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:28,760
There will be no internal representations.

888
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:31,240
There will be no internal symmetries.

889
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:35,280
This has been a huge trip up for things like supersymmetry, where we keep looking for these

890
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:42,280
super partners, which I've analogized a little bit to what happens if you're convinced that

891
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:49,280
Spiderman should be, in fact, Clark Kent, should be accompanied by Clark Kent, and Peter Parker

892
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:52,200
should be accompanied by Superman.

893
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:53,280
We have this wrong.

894
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:57,000
There is no internal symmetry, nor should you expect internal symmetry, because this comes

895
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:03,720
out of two fundamental origin stories, one for the spacetime manifold, another for effectively

896
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:08,960
the y-axis above that as the x-axis.

897
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:13,440
We decide that somehow we have spacetime and Einstein, and then somehow we get this thing

898
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:19,280
called SU3 cross SU2 cross U1 that falls out of the sky, which is a second origin story.

899
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:20,640
There is not two origin stories.

900
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:21,640
There is one.

901
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:25,320
Einstein, I believe, one of the problems, Stephen, I'm going to say, is that we have

902
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:31,160
been in a very difficult position relative to Einstein, because unlike anyone else, because

903
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:37,120
of the thought experiments, we have a reverence for not only what he gave us in terms of equations,

904
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:41,920
but also how he thought the beautiful humanity that he imparted to everyone, so we don't

905
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:43,520
want to harm him in any way.

906
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:48,720
It's also the fact that he was wrong, and he was wrong in an interesting way, in the

907
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:52,920
same way I believe that Newton was wrong, and we souped up Newton with Einstein, but

908
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:57,320
that physics is taking place, in my opinion, on two separate spaces.

909
01:21:57,320 --> 01:22:03,320
You can call x and y, or Brian, I've joked with you, calling it Harris and Hushamai,

910
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:06,040
the heaven and the earth.

911
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:11,360
In these two spaces, there is a map between, and that is the map that, in fact, Einstein

912
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:15,600
started playing with, but he did not think to pull back the information from space two

913
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:18,880
onto space one, from space x to space y.

914
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:24,040
I believe that there is a deformation complex, which in the Euclidean signature is elliptic,

915
01:22:24,040 --> 01:22:29,080
which in fact tells us why the self-dual equations and the Tren Simons-Gabe's theory that were

916
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:32,960
studied in the late 70s, early 80s, are so important.

917
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:38,240
In fact, it was a special example of a much more general structure, comes out of geometric

918
01:22:38,240 --> 01:22:39,240
unity.

919
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:42,680
That there is not two kinds of geometry in this situation.

920
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:48,640
One Riemannian geometry underlying general relativity, an Erismanian geometry of fiber

921
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:50,960
bundles underlying the standard model.

922
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:54,920
There is, in fact, one geometry, and that one geometry is why it's called geometric

923
01:22:54,920 --> 01:23:00,360
unity, and it has to do with the difficulty of a lie that we tell in general relativity,

924
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:04,720
which is that we say that it is a so-called gauge theory, where we try to get the gauge

925
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:09,560
group to be something called the diffeomorphism group, or general coordinate variance.

926
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:14,000
We allow it to act on the space of metrics, whereas in the case of the standard model,

927
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:19,720
we have a space, not of metrics, but of derivative operators from calculus called connections,

928
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:22,040
and the group we have is the gauge group.

929
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:26,400
The gauge group is an infinite dimensional beast that acts on the space of connection.

930
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:31,920
We do not understand, in fact, that telling this lie to make general relativity look like

931
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:36,520
a gauge theory, in fact, block progress, and that we should treat it as an honest gauge

932
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:37,520
theory.

933
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:41,360
We are going to have to recognize that the cosmological constant is not constant.

934
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:48,040
It is a field which acquires a BEV, or a vacuum expectation value, as it is lured away by topological

935
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:49,040
mechanisms.

936
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:52,000
We are going to see that we got the Lorentz group wrong.

937
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:55,640
We focused on the Lorentz group when we meant to be focusing on the gauge group.

938
01:23:55,640 --> 01:23:59,680
We formed its inhomogeneous extension called the Poincare group.

939
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:05,760
In fact, you're supposed to extend it by something called ad-valued one-forms to create, effectively,

940
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:08,120
the inhomogeneous gauge group.

941
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:12,400
That is the object on which you're supposed to do supersymmetric analysis.

942
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:14,960
Our concept of supersymmetry is wrong.

943
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:17,880
In effect, we're acting on the wrong group.

944
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:22,800
We've chosen Minkowski space as the naturally occurring affine space that is not the right

945
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:23,800
place to be playing.

946
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:26,760
The right place to be playing is the space of connection.

947
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:32,400
There's a huge number of things I can tell you about the missing matter.

948
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:40,760
What in our sector, its SU3 cross SU2 cross U1 internal quantum numbers will be 16 new

949
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:46,240
particles that are spin 3 halves with conjugate internal quantum numbers.

950
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:52,360
The same thing as our usual 16 dimensional representation, but the complex conjugate thereof,

951
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:59,360
which we have not seen yet, and explaining why the illusion of three generations is generated

952
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:05,840
by what would be called branching rules with respect to Lie algebra and Lie group representation

953
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:06,840
decomposition.

954
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:09,680
Yes, I can tell you a bunch of new particles.

955
01:25:09,680 --> 01:25:14,960
I can tell you about non-kirality, the number of generations, how Einstein is wrong, what

956
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:19,520
spaces we're supposed to be doing this on, and then there's a question about, okay, well,

957
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:21,520
what can you tell us about the accelerators?

958
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:25,400
By the way, this is all subject to, if my theory is correct, but it gets boring to say

959
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:28,040
if my theory is correct over and over again.

960
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:32,880
There should just be a general caveat that all of this assumes geometric unity is in fact

961
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:33,880
correct.

962
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:39,800
Yes, there's a ton of specificity, and Brian, I'm looking forward to coming down to UCSD

963
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:40,800
and actually doing it.

964
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:41,800
Let me just say something.

965
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:47,480
I've been very pissed off about this claim that what I'm talking about, different from

966
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:53,120
what Dr. Wolfram is talking about, is so impenetrable and difficult.

967
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:59,640
It really has to do with the sickness in our field that our field just isn't interested

968
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:02,040
in some sense because it doesn't believe.

969
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:07,280
We all know that the problems have gotten so difficult and so hard, and so many smart

970
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:12,720
people have been over them, that a sense of learned helplessness has invaded the field,

971
01:26:12,720 --> 01:26:14,160
which we have to talk about.

972
01:26:14,160 --> 01:26:18,920
People no longer feel like they're actual physicists that can connect to Schrodinger

973
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:22,800
or Heisenberg or Dirac or Einstein or Planck.

974
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:28,120
People don't even feel like Weinberg and Yang were still with us, or in some sense,

975
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:32,320
nobody's gone to, I see, losing the Nobel Prize at Brian's shoulder.

976
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:39,920
Nobody's gone to Stockholm for advances in fundamental physical theory, since the theories

977
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:42,520
put forward since the early 1970s.

978
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:44,120
I think that's a correct statement.

979
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:51,680
All the people who've contributed to the fundamental canon are either dead or septigenarians or

980
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:53,920
higher, I think.

981
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:57,680
Maybe Frank Wilczek was born in 1951, is at the end of the 60s.

982
01:26:57,680 --> 01:27:02,800
We have to recognize that this sense that it is impossible has caused lots of us to

983
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:07,600
start faking it and to start calculating what we need to do for our careers rather than

984
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:12,640
how to actually advance the science, which is one reason that both Stephen and I are

985
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:18,720
viewed as incredibly brash, effectively too brusque, maybe too arrogant.

986
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:23,960
The answer, I believe, is that we have to drive this field out of its sense that it's

987
01:27:23,960 --> 01:27:26,360
playing at physics rather than doing physics.

988
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:28,440
It's talking around physics.

989
01:27:28,440 --> 01:27:31,760
One of the things I want to do on these live streams is I want to actually talk about the

990
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:36,520
meat of the theories and let people scurry to Wikipedia or help each other out to try

991
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:40,200
to understand what is said rather than make it an enjoyable product for everybody.

992
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:41,200
I agree.

993
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:42,200
I agree.

994
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:45,040
But Stephen has said earlier, this is simple.

995
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:46,040
It's not easy.

996
01:27:46,040 --> 01:27:48,840
It's not trivial.

997
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:53,400
My nine-year-old, who you'll meet someday, hopefully both of you guys, he can play around

998
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:54,960
with rule 30.

999
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:56,240
He can get stimulated.

1000
01:27:56,240 --> 01:27:58,240
He can engage with it.

1001
01:27:58,240 --> 01:28:04,720
So when you say that it's not difficult, I don't agree that there's a character class

1002
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:08,160
that differentiates, and I'm not pitting it one against another.

1003
01:28:08,160 --> 01:28:12,440
For certain, there are more complicated models than even Eric's, in my opinion.

1004
01:28:12,440 --> 01:28:13,440
Wait, wait.

1005
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:14,440
How is my model complicated?

1006
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:15,920
I'm just a simple experimentalist.

1007
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:22,200
Fourteen-dimensional dual spaces, and look, if it's too complicated for Sabina to understand,

1008
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:23,400
I think our general...

1009
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:24,400
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1010
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:27,360
This is just unfair, and I want to be very clear about it.

1011
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:30,520
If you talk about general relativity, which Stephen has been talking about throughout

1012
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:36,120
our live stream, he's talking about the idea that you have a space, call it X, and it has

1013
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:37,520
a metric on it.

1014
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:43,120
And that metric is a map into the space of all possible metrics, call that Y.

1015
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:46,520
That X and that Y are where geometric unity lives.

1016
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:50,600
So with all due respect to Sabina and her, I can't understand anything.

1017
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:51,800
It's also complicated.

1018
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:57,640
You've got to map between the chronospacetime and the space of metrics.

1019
01:28:57,640 --> 01:29:02,920
That Romani metric is simply a map between two topological spaces.

1020
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:04,400
It's not that complicated.

1021
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:05,400
I don't...

1022
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:06,400
Brian, it's just not true.

1023
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:07,400
Okay.

1024
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:08,400
Let's move on, actually.

1025
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:09,400
I want to make a few comments about...

1026
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:10,400
Okay, Stephen, go ahead.

1027
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:11,800
So maybe people will find interesting.

1028
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:17,360
I mean, so, you know, maps between topological spaces, diffeomorphisms, these kinds of ideas.

1029
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:21,320
But, you know, I happened to learn these ideas when I was a kid.

1030
01:29:21,320 --> 01:29:23,160
Most people don't.

1031
01:29:23,160 --> 01:29:24,840
These are fairly...

1032
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:31,680
Most people learn those ideas in, I don't know, mid-math college, if they go to a fancy

1033
01:29:31,680 --> 01:29:34,840
college, maybe math, graduate school, those kinds of things.

1034
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:37,360
They happen to be fairly complicated.

1035
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:42,560
There are fields of science where people can contribute without having gone to graduate

1036
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:43,560
school.

1037
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:45,600
There are other fields where they can't contribute very much.

1038
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:47,800
We see that in people.

1039
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:53,000
One of the great things about kind of some of these computational areas of science is

1040
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:58,840
that because it's kind of, you know, because it's very new territory, it's possible for

1041
01:29:58,840 --> 01:30:02,280
people to contribute without having kind of gone to graduate school and learned a whole

1042
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:04,360
big stack of concepts.

1043
01:30:04,360 --> 01:30:09,000
One of the things, you know, I get pretty much every day, you know, a theory of physics

1044
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,000
from somebody.

1045
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:14,800
Eric's version is, you know, he went to Harvard and got a PhD in mathematical physics.

1046
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:19,440
So his version is much better dressed than most of the versions that I see.

1047
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:20,440
Okay?

1048
01:30:20,440 --> 01:30:25,000
And most of the versions that I see are, you know, I find it disappointing because it feels

1049
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:29,000
like people are, you know, writing poetry that nobody's going to read and they're doing

1050
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:32,280
it using kind of high school level physics knowledge.

1051
01:30:32,280 --> 01:30:33,280
It's mostly cranks.

1052
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:36,640
People who may be well-meaning, but they don't realize that they're way out of their

1053
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:37,640
depth.

1054
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:38,640
Yeah.

1055
01:30:38,640 --> 01:30:39,640
Right.

1056
01:30:39,640 --> 01:30:42,920
But the main thing is that they don't know what got done in the 20th century in physics.

1057
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:47,920
What got done in the 20th century in physics requires kind of graduate school level knowledge

1058
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:49,640
to understand.

1059
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:51,840
And we can say it isn't true, but it is true.

1060
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:55,920
I mean, it's, you know, general relativity and quantum field theory, you know, Eric

1061
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:57,320
may say they're simple theories.

1062
01:30:57,320 --> 01:31:01,480
I think they're kind of simple theories, but that's because I learned about them when

1063
01:31:01,480 --> 01:31:05,840
I was, I don't know, 12, 13 years old and by now they seem like simple theories.

1064
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:09,880
And if it's simple to you or if it's even marginally complex to Stephen, what, what

1065
01:31:09,880 --> 01:31:10,880
helped?

1066
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:16,600
So just the whole language of talking about things, you know, this is kind of math, graduate

1067
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:18,320
school type language.

1068
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:24,480
And that's, now, is there a way to state these things about fiber bundles and so on without

1069
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:26,200
sort of super fancy language?

1070
01:31:26,200 --> 01:31:27,760
Quite possibly.

1071
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:31,240
Maybe some of the things we're trying to do will give away to do that.

1072
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:33,960
And that's part of the hope of just bringing your communities together.

1073
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:36,160
Let me move on just because we don't know much time.

1074
01:31:36,160 --> 01:31:38,080
You guys are very gracious with your time.

1075
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:39,080
I want to respect it.

1076
01:31:39,080 --> 01:31:40,240
And I have kids to put to bed.

1077
01:31:40,240 --> 01:31:44,320
And I do want to ask the following question that my audience is asking when we think about

1078
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:46,560
the power of these different approaches.

1079
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:48,560
Let's take a step away from either one of yours.

1080
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:54,480
There's been a lot made about artificial intelligence and the prospects for as Max Tegmark has put

1081
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:57,760
it, you know, an artificial physicist and artificial Galileo.

1082
01:31:57,760 --> 01:32:00,960
What role do you guys see artificial intelligence playing?

1083
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:02,320
And then you know where I'm going next.

1084
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:05,920
I know that you guys know I'm going to the simulation hypothesis.

1085
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:09,680
And I've talked to you guys individually, maybe offline about this, but the audience

1086
01:32:09,680 --> 01:32:16,560
is very keen to know your two esteemed gentlemen, what you think about the prospects for AI and

1087
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:18,160
as a benefit to physics.

1088
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:20,160
And then later we'll ask about the simulation hypothesis.

1089
01:32:20,160 --> 01:32:21,760
Let me start with Steven, please.

1090
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:26,280
I mean, I've worked on what is now called AI for about 40 something years.

1091
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:28,240
So I know a tiny bit about it.

1092
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:30,280
A lot of, I don't know, I don't know where to start.

1093
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:34,640
I mean, if you're talking about machine learning, if you're talking about, oh, let's sort of

1094
01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:38,600
throw everything we know about physics into a machine learning system and see whether it

1095
01:32:38,640 --> 01:32:40,240
can figure out the laws of physics.

1096
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:41,160
That's one level.

1097
01:32:41,160 --> 01:32:41,960
Yeah, that's one level.

1098
01:32:41,960 --> 01:32:46,080
Noam Chomsky, who was on my show and said, you know, he has, he's sanguine about what

1099
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:51,240
you just described, perhaps as his max tag mark, but the true creative stroke, he has

1100
01:32:51,240 --> 01:32:56,760
no, you know, the kind of it's a little bit complicated because in, you know, computational

1101
01:32:56,760 --> 01:33:03,760
irreducibility tells us that we can know the rules for something, but have no way to kind

1102
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:07,240
of have a large scale narrative for how the thing happens.

1103
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:09,960
So in other words, we might say, yes, we've succeeded.

1104
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:12,240
We found rules that reproduce physics.

1105
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:14,840
You say, well, tell me how they work.

1106
01:33:15,160 --> 01:33:16,360
You say, well, here are the rules.

1107
01:33:16,640 --> 01:33:19,000
But you say, well, tell me a story about how they work.

1108
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,920
Tell me a high level, you know, version of how they work.

1109
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:23,840
That may not be possible.

1110
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:29,320
I mean, for example, in linguistics, picking on, on Noam Chomsky's area, you know, we may

1111
01:33:29,320 --> 01:33:35,080
have a description of how brains work and how brains process language at a sort of

1112
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:37,600
microscopic computational level.

1113
01:33:38,040 --> 01:33:40,680
And we may still, and it may be completely accurate.

1114
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:45,160
And we may still not have anything we would call a satisfactory science of linguistics.

1115
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:49,080
So in other words, it's a, it's a slightly complicated thing.

1116
01:33:49,080 --> 01:33:53,640
And the question of whether, you know, whether we can get a current, you know, machine learning

1117
01:33:53,640 --> 01:33:58,840
system to reverse engineer the laws of physics, you know, to some extent, you can do that to

1118
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:02,040
a fantastic extent of, of figuring out everything.

1119
01:34:02,040 --> 01:34:02,960
You won't be able to do that.

1120
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:08,120
I don't think and, and, you know, the challenge, again, we keep on coming at things at really

1121
01:34:08,120 --> 01:34:15,160
weird angles, but there's a, you know, okay, the way I see it, there's kind of what's possible

1122
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:18,200
in the computational universe, what simple programs can do.

1123
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:20,920
There's this kind of ocean of computational possibility.

1124
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:23,480
There's what we humans understand.

1125
01:34:24,120 --> 01:34:26,720
That's another kind of piece.

1126
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:29,320
And there's also what the physical universe does.

1127
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:34,080
And, you know, I've spent a large part of my life trying to bridge between the sort of

1128
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:38,440
ocean of computational possibility and what we humans understand, that's the whole sort

1129
01:34:38,440 --> 01:34:45,120
of point of the computational language I've built is to have a way to have humans be able

1130
01:34:45,120 --> 01:34:51,200
to think about things computationally and be able to communicate what they want in a

1131
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:52,400
computational fashion.

1132
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:55,480
Now we have the sort of third piece of physics.

1133
01:34:55,800 --> 01:35:01,080
And the question is how we describe, you know, how we make this bridge between sort of the

1134
01:35:01,080 --> 01:35:07,280
physical universe, doing what it does, our ability to tell a narrative about what's going

1135
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:12,680
on, and this kind of computation in the middle as this kind of mediator of those two things.

1136
01:35:12,680 --> 01:35:15,160
But I mean, this is, it's a mess.

1137
01:35:15,160 --> 01:35:19,560
I would say that there's a, there's a, I mean, this is a longer discussion.

1138
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:22,440
And I think there's probably the wrong angle to come at it with.

1139
01:35:22,640 --> 01:35:27,520
If you say, are we going to have a, a, you know, a magic thing that we can throw stuff

1140
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:29,680
into and get out the theory of physics?

1141
01:35:30,120 --> 01:35:30,960
Well, I doubt it.

1142
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:34,000
You know, you talked about the simulation argument, I might, I always find it kind of

1143
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:37,760
charming that people say, you know, I'm an atheist.

1144
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:39,280
I believe in science.

1145
01:35:40,040 --> 01:35:45,480
You know, what I believe is that, you know, there's this, we're in this universe and this

1146
01:35:45,480 --> 01:35:51,600
universe is actually a simulation operated by operated by the universe.

1147
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:53,840
But I'm an atheist.

1148
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:54,480
Exactly.

1149
01:35:54,480 --> 01:35:54,800
Right.

1150
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:57,400
And then all the morality that entails therein.

1151
01:35:57,400 --> 01:35:57,680
Yes.

1152
01:35:57,680 --> 01:35:58,040
Right.

1153
01:35:58,040 --> 01:36:02,520
But, but I think that the, more seriously, I think that that sort of argument is kind

1154
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:07,840
of philosophically doomed because by the time you have definite laws for physics, there

1155
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:10,560
isn't much for the God to do, so to speak.

1156
01:36:10,680 --> 01:36:14,640
Now, the only thing you might say is, but the God gets to pick the laws of physics,

1157
01:36:15,240 --> 01:36:20,680
except that we now seem to have found that it actually doesn't matter what the laws

1158
01:36:20,680 --> 01:36:25,720
of physics are, that in some sense, in this kind of, again, for reasons that again, this

1159
01:36:25,720 --> 01:36:27,160
is a slightly longer story.

1160
01:36:27,160 --> 01:36:32,920
But what matters is that we are observing physics in a certain way, and that's what

1161
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:35,880
gives us the laws that we believe to be laws of physics.

1162
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:40,120
And there really isn't, in a sense, there's nothing for the, for the God to do other

1163
01:36:40,120 --> 01:36:46,840
than to decide that our universe is going to be computational, not hyper computational,

1164
01:36:47,160 --> 01:36:48,960
not below computational.

1165
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:55,920
And even if those other sort of kind of conceptual universes exist, we, you know,

1166
01:36:55,920 --> 01:37:00,600
again, it's a matter of science to be able to say that we simply can't communicate with them.

1167
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:05,400
They're simply, they're just not things which are in any way connected to what we can perceive.

1168
01:37:05,680 --> 01:37:10,440
So I think it's a, it's a, I do like the idea, though, that there's a connection between sort

1169
01:37:10,440 --> 01:37:13,160
of AI physics and the simulation argument.

1170
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:17,080
I think that's a, that's a, that's an interesting and bizarre connection, which,

1171
01:37:17,080 --> 01:37:19,240
which I think would be fun to unpack some more.

1172
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:22,680
And Eric, you want to opine on this or would you, yeah, go ahead.

1173
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:29,080
I don't really know whether it even requires AI and, or AGI.

1174
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:35,000
There's a particular kind of move that we haven't programmed into computers yet,

1175
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:36,040
so far as I'm aware.

1176
01:37:36,040 --> 01:37:41,240
Now, Stephen probably knows this much better than I do, but there's a weird move that comes

1177
01:37:41,240 --> 01:37:47,640
up over and over again, which has to do with reaching for something outside of your model

1178
01:37:47,640 --> 01:37:49,240
and knowing what to reach for.

1179
01:37:49,240 --> 01:37:55,320
So for example, you have a problem with the weak interactions that a new neutron when it decays

1180
01:37:55,320 --> 01:38:01,320
into a proton and an electron called beta decay doesn't seem to have enough energy in the final

1181
01:38:01,320 --> 01:38:05,080
products to conserve energy from the initial products.

1182
01:38:05,080 --> 01:38:07,000
So Pauli had to.

1183
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:07,480
Oh yeah.

1184
01:38:07,480 --> 01:38:08,040
Okay.

1185
01:38:08,040 --> 01:38:09,720
You're explaining how new tree knows come to be.

1186
01:38:09,720 --> 01:38:09,880
Yeah.

1187
01:38:09,880 --> 01:38:10,120
Okay.

1188
01:38:10,120 --> 01:38:10,440
Fine.

1189
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:10,680
Yes.

1190
01:38:10,680 --> 01:38:11,000
Right.

1191
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,320
Because it's like one of the most important stories we have.

1192
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:14,120
Not everybody knows it.

1193
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:20,680
You have a problem that you've got three lines coming into a point and there's a failure of

1194
01:38:20,680 --> 01:38:22,040
conservation of momentum.

1195
01:38:22,040 --> 01:38:25,080
And so you have to hypothesize a fourth line.

1196
01:38:25,080 --> 01:38:29,800
You had a different problem when Dirac came out with his theory, which is, is that he only had

1197
01:38:29,800 --> 01:38:32,600
the electron and the proton, they were oppositely charged.

1198
01:38:32,600 --> 01:38:35,640
So we decided that one was the antiparticle of the other.

1199
01:38:35,640 --> 01:38:40,680
Instead, this is the part, you know, similar to the Peter Parker-Clarke-Kent issue,

1200
01:38:40,680 --> 01:38:45,400
he should have hypothesized a positron to be the anti-electron, to be the anti-electron

1201
01:38:45,400 --> 01:38:49,080
and an antiproton to be the antiparticle of the familiar proton.

1202
01:38:49,080 --> 01:38:51,240
That move was too much.

1203
01:38:51,240 --> 01:38:53,720
And in fact, Heisenberg chastised it.

1204
01:38:53,720 --> 01:38:57,800
There's an issue about understanding how spin comes about.

1205
01:38:57,800 --> 01:39:02,760
So effectively, when I've said that the square root is the psychedelic of mathematics,

1206
01:39:02,760 --> 01:39:09,000
you have to give your computer program psychedelics effectively so that it can invent new stuff.

1207
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:14,760
That is, I can join something called i or i, j and k to solve a problem that was posed in the

1208
01:39:14,760 --> 01:39:15,320
real numbers.

1209
01:39:15,320 --> 01:39:18,680
And then I get the quaternions with complex numbers or even the actonians.

1210
01:39:18,680 --> 01:39:24,120
I'm going to augment my theory of something called differential forms to something called

1211
01:39:24,120 --> 01:39:25,480
the theory of spinners.

1212
01:39:25,480 --> 01:39:30,120
Can you discover something called the fofian, which is the square root of the determinant

1213
01:39:30,120 --> 01:39:32,120
for a particular class of matrices?

1214
01:39:32,120 --> 01:39:36,040
Can you discover that the Euler class is in a certain sense the square root of something

1215
01:39:36,040 --> 01:39:37,800
called the Pontriagin class?

1216
01:39:37,800 --> 01:39:43,960
All of these things are these non-trivial moves where something that is not present in

1217
01:39:43,960 --> 01:39:51,080
the initial formulation is guessable as the thing that would be needed to complete the

1218
01:39:51,080 --> 01:39:55,320
stuff that we can see with stuff that we can't to get a consistent system.

1219
01:39:56,120 --> 01:40:02,440
If you can teach a computer about primitives and give it the ability to guess outside of

1220
01:40:02,440 --> 01:40:06,360
the system that you've taught it so that it can self-adjoin.

1221
01:40:06,440 --> 01:40:09,320
And I don't see any impediment to this currently.

1222
01:40:09,320 --> 01:40:14,440
You would have a system that would be potent enough to explore not only the theory that

1223
01:40:14,440 --> 01:40:18,600
you feed it, but the theories that it can build from that theory.

1224
01:40:18,600 --> 01:40:22,840
And in essence, the computer program is being asked to do something similar than what we're

1225
01:40:22,840 --> 01:40:24,840
asking theoretical physics to do.

1226
01:40:24,840 --> 01:40:29,000
Again, everybody complains about how complicated this is and I'm sick and tired and bored of

1227
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:29,880
hearing it.

1228
01:40:29,880 --> 01:40:30,840
Steven's correct.

1229
01:40:30,840 --> 01:40:35,080
You do have to learn some level of mathematics.

1230
01:40:35,080 --> 01:40:39,560
Typically, this would be somewhat like learning the French language before exploring French

1231
01:40:39,560 --> 01:40:40,040
literature.

1232
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:42,840
Yeah, it's expensive.

1233
01:40:42,840 --> 01:40:44,840
If you want to learn a foreign language, it costs money.

1234
01:40:45,400 --> 01:40:49,640
In time, same thing for learning differential geometry in quantum field theory.

1235
01:40:49,640 --> 01:40:56,360
The situation that we're facing is that your computer program has to be capable of building

1236
01:40:56,360 --> 01:41:01,880
larger worlds by adjoining things that would make puzzles in the worlds that it knows about

1237
01:41:01,880 --> 01:41:02,680
make sense.

1238
01:41:02,680 --> 01:41:08,600
And that process of inferential guessing outside of anything that's been taught is a different

1239
01:41:08,600 --> 01:41:13,880
problem than the problem of finding, let's say, chess moves or go moves by being able to search

1240
01:41:13,880 --> 01:41:17,000
a larger space where the search space is implicit in the rules.

1241
01:41:17,640 --> 01:41:20,120
So do I believe that it requires AGI?

1242
01:41:20,120 --> 01:41:26,120
Now, one of the stories that I don't think we talk that much about is how much we thought AGI or

1243
01:41:26,120 --> 01:41:30,760
artificial general intelligence would be needed to do all sorts of things.

1244
01:41:30,760 --> 01:41:35,000
And the great surprise is we don't need anything like artificial general intelligence

1245
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:38,600
to do most of the things that supposedly intelligence systems now do.

1246
01:41:39,160 --> 01:41:44,440
We thought that AGI and our consciousness and our intelligence was necessary.

1247
01:41:44,440 --> 01:41:47,320
It turns out that much less is usually necessary.

1248
01:41:47,320 --> 01:41:51,880
It is entirely possible that we don't need to wait around and we can have the computers guess it.

1249
01:41:51,880 --> 01:41:58,600
And to the issue of atheism and the simulators and the simulated, we have two separate stories,

1250
01:41:58,600 --> 01:42:05,160
one story in which we are going to build the intelligence, the AGI fear, which it's going

1251
01:42:05,160 --> 01:42:06,360
to be smarter than us.

1252
01:42:06,360 --> 01:42:11,000
We have another one in which we are the simulated and there's the simulated tour somewhere else.

1253
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:17,160
If you put the two stories together, you see that in a weird way, God should be scared about us

1254
01:42:17,160 --> 01:42:20,680
becoming intelligence when we finally learn what our source code is.

1255
01:42:20,680 --> 01:42:23,560
This is the moment where Skynet becomes self-aware.

1256
01:42:23,560 --> 01:42:26,760
And the thing that nobody sees coming is that we are the AI.

1257
01:42:26,760 --> 01:42:30,120
We are the AGI that emerged in somebody else's system.

1258
01:42:30,120 --> 01:42:33,880
And whether or not that somebody else was sentient or not is a different question.

1259
01:42:33,880 --> 01:42:35,400
But Einstein asked this thing.

1260
01:42:35,400 --> 01:42:38,280
He said, I don't care about the spectrum or this or that element.

1261
01:42:38,280 --> 01:42:42,840
What really bothers me is whether or not the creator had any choice or what interests me

1262
01:42:42,840 --> 01:42:45,800
is whether the creator had any choice in the way the world was made.

1263
01:42:45,800 --> 01:42:50,440
This is an interesting concept of not being all powerful, but being all constrained.

1264
01:42:51,080 --> 01:42:56,760
And perhaps the creator's sole function, if you will, is to turn on the lights.

1265
01:42:56,760 --> 01:42:58,600
And everything else follows from that.

1266
01:42:58,600 --> 01:43:05,160
This is sort of a Leibnizian monad construction where the idea is that the rules effectively

1267
01:43:05,160 --> 01:43:09,000
tell us what is going to happen and there's very little room for anything else.

1268
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:14,680
But I think that part of the reason we keep asking these questions is to be blunt pessimism.

1269
01:43:14,680 --> 01:43:19,160
Rather than working on the actually hard stuff, either in Stephen's case of trying to do it

1270
01:43:19,160 --> 01:43:24,520
through computation or my case of trying to remain within the standard mathematical tool kit.

1271
01:43:24,520 --> 01:43:29,320
People are so frustrated that we waste our lives talking about the mathematical universe

1272
01:43:29,320 --> 01:43:32,040
hypothesis, the simulation hypothesis.

1273
01:43:32,040 --> 01:43:37,000
We do all sorts of nonsensical work on theories that have nothing to do with physical reality.

1274
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:42,920
And I just think it would be better if we stopped wasting our time talking around physics

1275
01:43:42,920 --> 01:43:44,520
and started talking about physics itself.

1276
01:43:44,520 --> 01:43:46,360
Well, guys, I have to go.

1277
01:43:47,080 --> 01:43:49,000
You guys have been so generous with your time.

1278
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,640
You've answered a lot of questions that the audience had.

1279
01:43:51,640 --> 01:43:57,000
And for that, I'm very thankful from both coasts.

1280
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:58,760
Any final words, Stephen?

1281
01:43:58,760 --> 01:44:03,000
I did think there was going to be one question you wanted to ask us about peer review

1282
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,400
and our attitudes towards it, which I think people are going to want to know.

1283
01:44:05,400 --> 01:44:07,000
I think we should wrap it up.

1284
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:11,880
Maybe we'll take that up on a future podcast with you guys individually.

1285
01:44:11,880 --> 01:44:17,400
The time has really come to go, or I'll be in a lot of trouble with a multiverse of children

1286
01:44:17,400 --> 01:44:18,200
screaming at me.

1287
01:44:18,920 --> 01:44:23,000
Stephen, anything you'd like to leave the audience with, any way that they can engage

1288
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:26,920
and perhaps participate in the exciting work of Wolfram Research?

1289
01:44:26,920 --> 01:44:28,680
Use Wolfram Language, use Wolfram Alpha.

1290
01:44:29,880 --> 01:44:34,280
You can come to live streams we do frequently about the physics project.

1291
01:44:34,280 --> 01:44:36,360
You can look at the physics website.

1292
01:44:36,360 --> 01:44:40,440
You'll find all of the programs and things there.

1293
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:44,520
It seems like people are finding this stuff, which is great.

1294
01:44:44,520 --> 01:44:48,760
And we'll put a link to the YouTube channel where folks can find your many, many live streams

1295
01:44:48,760 --> 01:44:50,280
and presentations as well.

1296
01:44:50,280 --> 01:44:54,280
Eric, something for closeout, where can people find you and engage with you?

1297
01:44:54,280 --> 01:44:55,560
Come find us at the portal.

1298
01:44:55,560 --> 01:44:59,160
I think there's also an Eric Weinstein.org.

1299
01:44:59,160 --> 01:45:03,960
Look for the Geometric Unity presentation, which was a special presentation within the

1300
01:45:03,960 --> 01:45:04,840
Portal series.

1301
01:45:04,840 --> 01:45:11,160
I am looking forward to hosting Stephen getting into the thick of his theory and how it works.

1302
01:45:11,160 --> 01:45:15,960
I think that one of the things that people should get engaged with is both why people

1303
01:45:15,960 --> 01:45:19,240
are so pessimistic and negative about every new emergence.

1304
01:45:19,240 --> 01:45:23,400
You should learn about the no-go theorems and all of the things that a theory would have to fit.

1305
01:45:23,400 --> 01:45:24,920
I don't think people are particularly negative.

1306
01:45:24,920 --> 01:45:27,720
I mean, honestly, we've been playing up the negativism.

1307
01:45:27,720 --> 01:45:33,480
But honestly, what I'm seeing is people being very enthusiastic about what we're doing.

1308
01:45:34,280 --> 01:45:36,840
So far, I haven't seen anybody.

1309
01:45:36,840 --> 01:45:42,840
I'd be interested to hear from somebody credible who says, I mean, you've said,

1310
01:45:42,840 --> 01:45:43,880
I don't believe your theory.

1311
01:45:43,880 --> 01:45:45,560
Wait a second.

1312
01:45:47,400 --> 01:45:54,040
No, I believe that your theory is either going to reproduce a lot of what it is that we already

1313
01:45:54,040 --> 01:45:55,960
know and then tell us something new potentially.

1314
01:45:57,480 --> 01:45:58,680
I'm not disagreeing with it.

1315
01:45:58,680 --> 01:46:01,960
I've said that it might be a face up to some common subject.

1316
01:46:01,960 --> 01:46:03,560
It's certainly not the face that I'm taking.

1317
01:46:05,560 --> 01:46:08,760
We should hash that out when we do each other's podcasts.

1318
01:46:09,640 --> 01:46:13,160
The issue that I wanted to get to, though, is, yeah, there is a lot of negativity.

1319
01:46:13,160 --> 01:46:14,920
You can read about it in the Reddit comments.

1320
01:46:14,920 --> 01:46:18,440
You can read about it very often left in the YouTube comments.

1321
01:46:18,440 --> 01:46:20,520
Some people in the field are very disgruntled.

1322
01:46:20,520 --> 01:46:23,400
Very few people have wanted to say, I've waited in.

1323
01:46:23,400 --> 01:46:24,760
I've tried to look at it.

1324
01:46:24,760 --> 01:46:26,280
I've really kind of to understand it.

1325
01:46:26,280 --> 01:46:28,440
And I still think these guys are talking crap.

1326
01:46:28,440 --> 01:46:35,000
I think Steven's exactly right that the coincidence of his work and my work being on the same show,

1327
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
I don't see any need to fit them together.

1328
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:42,040
And I think that if they're both right, then they would have to be fit together.

1329
01:46:42,040 --> 01:46:46,120
And most probably, of course, they're both wrong because that we have to say these words.

1330
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:53,880
With that said, get excited about people who are trying to find ways out of the learned

1331
01:46:53,880 --> 01:46:58,840
helplessness that comes out of the no-go theorems, the pessimism that came out of the LHC.

1332
01:46:59,560 --> 01:47:00,600
I disagree with Steven.

1333
01:47:00,600 --> 01:47:06,680
I still think that there is a core community that's angry that people outside are speaking to the world

1334
01:47:06,680 --> 01:47:07,160
through this direction.

1335
01:47:07,160 --> 01:47:07,960
They may be angry about you.

1336
01:47:07,960 --> 01:47:10,600
I don't think they're very angry about me, at least not that.

1337
01:47:10,600 --> 01:47:11,080
Yeah, maybe they were.

1338
01:47:11,080 --> 01:47:12,040
There is pessimism.

1339
01:47:12,040 --> 01:47:13,720
I think Eric's talking specifically.

1340
01:47:13,720 --> 01:47:16,920
I guarantee you there are people angry about you too, Steven.

1341
01:47:16,920 --> 01:47:18,520
It's not just about me.

1342
01:47:18,520 --> 01:47:23,880
It's in general that we're all up against a question where nobody has any precedent.

1343
01:47:23,880 --> 01:47:28,120
I think people have one thing that I think is the case is that what I've noticed,

1344
01:47:28,120 --> 01:47:31,560
for example, about peer review, which we're not going to talk about here in detail,

1345
01:47:31,560 --> 01:47:36,680
but it's the people who say peer review is amazing.

1346
01:47:36,680 --> 01:47:40,520
We need peer review on not people inside science.

1347
01:47:40,520 --> 01:47:44,920
They're not people who actually know it up close because up close, it's actually people.

1348
01:47:44,920 --> 01:47:46,360
In fact, one thing's kind of amusing.

1349
01:47:46,360 --> 01:47:51,320
We set up a peer review system for our project and to date,

1350
01:47:51,320 --> 01:47:54,520
not a single person has submitted a peer review.

1351
01:47:54,520 --> 01:47:55,320
Not a single person.

1352
01:47:55,320 --> 01:47:56,600
It's been several months now.

1353
01:47:56,600 --> 01:48:00,200
How can people submit reviews of it?

1354
01:48:00,200 --> 01:48:02,360
It just says there's just a link that says peer review.

1355
01:48:02,360 --> 01:48:04,920
It's next to each one of our documents.

1356
01:48:04,920 --> 01:48:06,120
I encourage people to do it.

1357
01:48:06,120 --> 01:48:07,720
I mean, honestly, I'm disappointed.

1358
01:48:07,720 --> 01:48:11,720
I thought at least a few people would do it, even if they were like,

1359
01:48:11,720 --> 01:48:13,880
I didn't really read this, but it's all nonsense anyway.

1360
01:48:14,760 --> 01:48:18,840
But what we actually asked for, more specifically, which I think is useful,

1361
01:48:18,840 --> 01:48:24,360
is somebody to say, I read section 3.7, and I think it's correct,

1362
01:48:24,360 --> 01:48:26,600
or I think there's this mistake in it or whatever else.

1363
01:48:26,600 --> 01:48:29,640
We have had people like Sabine Hossenfeldt, an eminent scientist,

1364
01:48:29,640 --> 01:48:33,080
and she's written a video, which is the first time you guys appeared together,

1365
01:48:33,080 --> 01:48:34,920
where she criticizes these theories.

1366
01:48:34,920 --> 01:48:37,560
And she's an eminent fundamental theorist.

1367
01:48:37,560 --> 01:48:40,120
We've been an email correspondence with her,

1368
01:48:40,120 --> 01:48:43,240
and she asked a bunch of questions, which were very valid questions.

1369
01:48:43,240 --> 01:48:48,200
So we gave her answers, and she disappeared.

1370
01:48:48,760 --> 01:48:53,240
So if she's still saying she doesn't know what's going on, then there's a problem.

1371
01:48:53,880 --> 01:48:56,520
Well, the fact is, is that you've answered her questions.

1372
01:48:56,520 --> 01:48:59,880
She had questions that were reasonable, and that's the beginning of the process.

1373
01:48:59,880 --> 01:49:03,080
Then if she continues to say, well, he hasn't answered my questions

1374
01:49:03,080 --> 01:49:05,400
after he's answered the questions, and she hasn't responded,

1375
01:49:05,400 --> 01:49:06,520
then we're in a different situation.

1376
01:49:06,520 --> 01:49:07,080
Yeah, then we can actually-

1377
01:49:07,080 --> 01:49:11,800
I know Sabine can be kind of gruff and unpleasant,

1378
01:49:11,800 --> 01:49:15,480
but I know her to be reasonably fair in most circumstances.

1379
01:49:15,480 --> 01:49:17,160
Very good. Thank you guys.

1380
01:49:17,160 --> 01:49:19,960
You guys are really spectacular.

1381
01:49:19,960 --> 01:49:22,760
It's so generous of you to spend your time,

1382
01:49:22,760 --> 01:49:26,280
and we got to see different sides of your ideas

1383
01:49:26,280 --> 01:49:32,360
and try to reach some sense of different approaches that are radically different,

1384
01:49:32,360 --> 01:49:34,600
and perhaps, but they have the same common goal,

1385
01:49:34,600 --> 01:49:38,040
which is to really introduce the world to concepts

1386
01:49:38,520 --> 01:49:42,520
take us out of our quotidian existence of politics, sports, and whatever,

1387
01:49:42,520 --> 01:49:43,640
the grandest concepts.

1388
01:49:43,640 --> 01:49:45,560
I think we should have talked about those here.

1389
01:49:45,560 --> 01:49:47,400
That would have been more interesting for me.

1390
01:49:47,400 --> 01:49:53,160
Let's do more where we actually treat the people who want to get into the meat of it,

1391
01:49:53,160 --> 01:49:54,200
because I think that-

1392
01:49:54,200 --> 01:49:57,800
No, no. I was saying less meat, because I don't think this was so useful,

1393
01:49:57,800 --> 01:50:02,200
because I think that I felt like we would have done better talking

1394
01:50:02,200 --> 01:50:04,360
about kind of the culture of science and so on.

1395
01:50:04,360 --> 01:50:06,440
I'm sorry. I take all the blame.

1396
01:50:06,440 --> 01:50:09,240
Yes, I know. I'm sorry. It's my fault for not getting to that.

1397
01:50:09,240 --> 01:50:12,200
Thank you, Steven. Thank you, Eric. I love your work. Bye, guys.
