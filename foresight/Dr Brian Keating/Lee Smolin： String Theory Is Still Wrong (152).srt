1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,800
Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.

2
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:20,720
A legendary figure in my life, in physics, in cosmology, in philosophy, in mathematics,

3
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,160
and that is Professor Lee Smolin joining us from the Perimeter Institute, our neighbor

4
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,160
to the north.

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,080
Lee Smolin, how are you today, my friend?

6
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,520
I'm very well, thank you, and thank you very much for the kind words and the invitation.

7
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,920
Lee, you've made fundamental contributions in many different aspects of cosmology, of physics,

8
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:46,800
philosophy, but what I first wanted to turn to is the influence that you had on me as a

9
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:54,160
younger physicist, as a beginning professor back in 2006, when you're really a pockle book called

10
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,240
The Trouble with Physics came out.

11
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:01,520
This book influenced me and a whole generation of physicists, both theoreticians and experimentalists

12
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:08,480
like myself, and there are very few books that in physics that are relevant 14, 15, 16,

13
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,400
four years, three years, two years after they're written, let alone 15 years after.

14
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,200
And in this book, which I reread, re-listened to recently in preparation for this interview,

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,800
I noted that you were talking about the stagnation in physics in the previous 25 years.

16
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,360
So if I add, I'm not as good at math as you are, but if I add 25 to 15, I get 40.

17
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,360
Wow, I just do.

18
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,240
Do you still stand by that, or do you still observe that same stagnation, to some extent,

19
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,400
in physics, at least in theoretical physics? Obviously, experimental physics is completely

20
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,040
different.

21
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,840
There are certainly areas which are doing very well. There are areas of quantum materials where

22
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,080
the theory is really interesting, and I love thinking about it.

23
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:59,840
I think it's still true that we have not made a fundamental discovery experimentally,

24
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,520
that we explained theoretically, or theoretically posited something

25
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,320
that was discovered experimentally.

26
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:13,120
And we still don't know the why questions about the standing model.

27
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:19,520
Why though? There are now something like 30 parameters, including now that the neutrino

28
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,000
has mass, including the masses and the mixing angles of the neutrino.

29
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,800
And we have no explanation for what the values of those dimensions are,

30
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:39,200
nor for the strength of the gravitational constant, nor for the dark energy or the cosmological

31
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:49,760
constant. And I went into physics to understand why the universe was the way it is.

32
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:58,240
And there's lots about that we can get into. The universe is not just some random set of

33
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:06,240
numbers out there. The universe is enormously structured and organized and self-organized,

34
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:13,120
and that seems to be at least partly due to those constants being in certain narrow windows,

35
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,040
where there are lots of chemical and nuclear reactions that can take place.

36
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:30,640
So I think I stand by that. We have ideas about quantum gravity, and we have more ideas than

37
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:36,800
we did 15 years ago. None of them have some of them make experimental predictions,

38
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:44,880
but none of those predictions have enough to help. There's always the default, as you would know,

39
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:50,800
we've looked for the rent symmetry breaking at the Planck scale and around the Planck scale,

40
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:57,360
using astrophysical experiments. And the evidence is that it's not there. And there's a number of

41
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:06,080
anomalies that we've looked for, and they're not there. So it's a very frustrating period.

42
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:12,320
When we look at alternatives to string theory, which has become and still remains a dominant

43
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:19,040
paradigm, I've had conversations with Carla Revelli, who's become a dear friend. And actually,

44
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,520
we are collaborating together. And he is another person, I thank you for putting me

45
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,680
in touch with many years ago. And we are collaborating on the first ever audio book

46
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:35,840
version of Galileo Galilei's dialogue on two chief world systems. Yeah, it's going to be amazing

47
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:41,600
with another Italian physicist, along with Jim Gates reading a foreword from Galileo,

48
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,920
Fabiola Gianate, and others. Stay tuned for more information about that. You can get more if you

49
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:53,040
subscribe to my newsletter at bryankeating.com. But I want to turn our attention to some surprising

50
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,080
developments that I had talking with a string theory proponent. And that was Michio Kaku,

51
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,920
who came on my podcast recently in promotion of his new book, The God Equation, which he claims,

52
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:08,800
you know, string theory is responsible for a series of successes, not stagnations, even even

53
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:17,040
such things like the G minus two anomaly and the LHC beauty experiment anomaly, that these

54
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:23,360
things are hints, tantalizing hints of the efficacy of string theory. And I pushed back, Lee, you

55
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,080
know, I'm only a simple experimentalist, I said, but I said, to my knowledge, and you, Lee, can

56
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,680
correct me if I'm wrong. Nobody looked at string theory and said, hmm, let's predict this correction

57
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:40,160
to the G minus two from string theory. And he pushed back on me and said, well, nobody did that

58
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,520
from loop quantum gravity, because loop quantum gravity is so simplistic, it doesn't even have

59
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:52,640
fermions in it. And I said, because I'm just a fool, I don't, I didn't know how to answer him,

60
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,960
you know, and then we say in Judaism know how to answer a heretic. So I didn't know how to

61
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,360
answer him. How would you have answered him, Michio Kaku, when he says loop quantum gravity,

62
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,640
which you are one of its foremost exponents, along with Abbas, Abe Ashdekar, and Carlo and

63
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:10,480
others. But Lee, how should I have answered him? I'm sorry, I let you down, but how should I have

64
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:17,840
answered him? No, the way to end there, first of all, loop quantum gravity is a method. It's not,

65
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:28,080
in my understanding, a theory. It's a method of studying systems whose forces are described by

66
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:33,200
gauge fields. And we can talk about what that means, like the standard model of general relativity.

67
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:41,280
And that method applied to general relativity yields some very interesting descriptions of what

68
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:48,240
the geometry of the world might be on very small scales. That is 10 to the minus 30 something of

69
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:56,000
a centimeter. That method can be applied to theories with fermions. And there are,

70
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:03,840
then, fermions behave like fermions. So there's no problem including fermions. There's no problem

71
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:11,040
coupling to gauge fields and coupling to the scalar and the fermions of the standard model.

72
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:20,320
There is a very interesting issue about chirality, which I know is an issue in cosmology and

73
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:27,680
astronomy that we've worked on a lot and thought about. So we have some issues about chirality,

74
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:40,160
which I'm happy to admit. My feeling, and I hope I can say this without sounding egotistical or

75
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:51,040
something. The people you mentioned, Abai and Carlo and I, are thought of often as the founders

76
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:59,280
of the quantum gravity, the inventors. But let's break, if it's interesting, let's break that down.

77
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:10,640
Abai brought into being an approach to general relativity based on seeing the

78
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:16,320
geometry of space and time like a gauge theory. And I can tell you what that means.

79
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:28,560
It means we care more about measuring how things like fingers or spins move around when you move

80
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:41,200
around space. That's called the connection. The connection tells things. And my first role,

81
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:48,080
I guess I had many, but my first role was that there was a whole bunch of beautiful ideas and

82
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:56,960
technology, theoretical technology, that had been developed about QCD, mainly by a Russian school,

83
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:06,240
Sasha Pavlikov, Gribov, McDowell. And there were also some Americans, principally, Ken Wilson.

84
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:14,560
And they had a beautiful picture in which, well, do you know, or do your listeners know, that if you

85
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:22,480
pass a magnetic field through a superconductor, it becomes discreet. There's a unit of magnetic

86
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:32,400
flux that that flux line will take on in this organization. And their hypothesis going,

87
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:38,960
well, it was also due to Holger Nielsen and a number of other people, was that in QCD, which is

88
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:47,920
sort of like a complicated version of electromagnetism with three photons, the electric field flux

89
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:55,120
would be quantized and discreet. And there was a picture of strings made out of that flux

90
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:03,680
holding forks together. And I basically stole that. I mean, it's legitimate. That's what we're

91
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:11,200
doing science. All that picture and technology and said, what if instead of QCD, I plug in the

92
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:21,280
bias theory about seeing gravity and connection here and use all those beautiful ideas and tools

93
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:28,640
that I probably call them Ken Wilson. And that was, that was, I got lucky, in some sense, because

94
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,720
where and when I went to graduate school, it was immersed in that those ideas and those

95
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:42,640
technologies. And I was the first to try to apply them to quantum gravity. And I had a picture in

96
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:52,880
my head of loops and areas being quantized and so forth. And that picture with a lot of input

97
00:10:52,880 --> 00:11:00,400
from other people became quantum gravity. And particularly, Carlos brought a very important

98
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:10,240
picture of how to think of the quantum mechanics of all that. But now, but now it's, that was the

99
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:18,880
middle 80s, I want to count, that's a long time ago. I love quantum gravity. It's been a family.

100
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:28,000
It's been an adventure of friends. But it has problems too. And I'm happy to talk about them.

101
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:35,840
I'm not, I would not think of myself as a proponent in the sense of somebody who ignores

102
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:43,920
the issues. I think there are issues. And when I set up a research center, perimeter,

103
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:50,000
I used a philosophy, which is part of the book you want to talk about the trouble with physics,

104
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:57,760
which I gained from the philosopher Paul Farahman, which was to get good people from

105
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:04,480
diverse points of view, and don't privilege one point of view just because I have a legacy

106
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:11,440
with that theory, get good people who do you think of quantum gravity from several points of view,

107
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:18,240
and have it and have the conflict, which is what the trouble with physics was about.

108
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:24,960
Right. So there are people in the loop on gravity world who think that I abandoned them,

109
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:30,800
and there are people in the rest of the world who think that I'm a loop on gravity guy. And I'm neither.

110
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:40,960
I really love the way you say that. And, you know, when I think about things, I often wonder,

111
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:47,280
you know, are we, are we putting the gut before the toe or the toe before the gut? And by that,

112
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:53,760
I mean, you know, we don't have a good grand unified theory yet, in my opinion, or my understanding.

113
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,760
And yet people want to look for a theory of everything. First of all, I think a theory of

114
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,320
everything. And I think Michio does a disservice, to be honest, by saying that this one inch long

115
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,040
God equation will describe everything. It'll give you soup and nuts, and it'll give you aliens.

116
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,840
It'll give you avatars traveling at the speed of light cruising around the galaxy. It will give

117
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:16,640
be, you know, and it will win you a Nobel Prize that Einstein couldn't win. And you know how I

118
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:21,920
feel about the Nobel Prize is hagiographic, you know, kind of idol worship, onanistic idol worship.

119
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:29,120
Nevertheless, it's important to consider what is the importance of a theory of everything.

120
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,720
And I want to ask you, are we putting the toe before the gut? Should we, in your opinion,

121
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,800
spend more time thinking about how do we unify the theories that, you know, we have

122
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,640
very strong evidence to believe that are unified? I personally don't believe

123
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:48,240
that we should demand that gravity be unified with quantum mechanics. I hope we can get into that.

124
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,000
But what do you think? Should we focus first on guts before we get to toes?

125
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:59,440
Well, long before that, let's open up, can we open up to the whole universe?

126
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:08,800
Yeah. It seems to me there are two kinds of phenomena. They're loosely speaking, they're

127
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:16,960
phenomena. I mean, we believe you and I and most of our colleagues believe some version of the

128
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,160
laws are pretty stable and they're fundamental laws and we're trying to find out what they are

129
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:27,760
and they're pretty stable. I actually probably disagree with you or at least with most of our

130
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:33,360
colleagues. I think those laws are changeable and I think they do change and I think they have

131
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:39,520
change and I think that because that's the only way we're going to explain the question of why they

132
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:47,920
have the form that they have. So I'm on the lookout for principles by which the laws can change.

133
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:55,040
That is, I'm no longer hopeful that there's going to be some magic formula that's going to tell us

134
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:00,560
what the values of all those planets are. I think it evolved that way because there are consequences

135
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:09,040
for the natural world, for the physical world, which we can come to. Thinking about it that way,

136
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:14,800
you have to invoke functional explanation. A functional explanation is an explanation of

137
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:21,840
something where you use some consequence of what it does in the world. So there are

138
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:31,520
20 to the thousand different kinds of proteins, roughly. That's 20 different amino acids in

139
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:39,760
a thousand places. It's a typical protein. That's a whole lot more than the kinds of proteins that

140
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:46,240
exist on the biosphere that are coded for in the DNA or the RNA of the various creatures,

141
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:55,440
which are like a million. So any protein that exists is lucky because most of the other

142
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:02,640
alternate proteins don't exist. And why did it get lucky? It got lucky because, for example,

143
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:10,640
my code for hemoglobin, which is a fundamental way to move oxygen around within a creature,

144
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:19,840
and which there's a lot of, along with various variants and so forth. So if you ask why does

145
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:27,920
hemoglobin exist, sure, you've got to be able to analyze and see the laws of electromagnetism and

146
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:36,880
so forth, acting inside that crazy, wound-up, folded-up thing. But there's also functional

147
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:46,400
explanations, and both of them have got to work. And I think that's going to apply to everything.

148
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:55,600
And I also don't take the mathematics as dogma, as religion, if I can use that. I was at one time,

149
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:01,440
but I am no longer looking for that mathematical object, which has all the truth of that nature,

150
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:12,240
to somehow transcend our existence and give our life meaning. I think we give life meaning through

151
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:20,320
friendship and families and what we believe in and who we love. And the universe kind of thus

152
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:30,480
is doing the same thing. So I'm not, many of our colleagues are looking for something transcendent

153
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,360
when they want to know what the laws are, what the standard model, what the two unified theories are.

154
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:43,440
I would love to see some explanation of the structure of the standard model. I've been attending,

155
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:50,400
we have weird conferences, of course, as you know, some conferences are every week or somewhere every

156
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:56,640
month. So there's a conference about an idea that used to get you kicked out of the archive,

157
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:02,240
but it turns out to be solid enough that there are a lot of interesting people doing it,

158
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,960
which is that the standard model has something to do with the number system of actonians.

159
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:13,760
And that would be cool. But I'd certainly like some explanation. Where does the SU-3,

160
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:18,640
of course, SU-2 come from? Where does the three generations come from? We all want

161
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:26,320
some kind of answer to that. And my, I'm willing, I'm in fact, eager to have a functional kind of

162
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:38,400
example. For example, this might come up later. If you want the universe to reproduce itself

163
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:45,040
through black holes, which is an idea that I had, you want the upper mass limit of neutron stars

164
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,120
to be as low as possible so that as many supernovas

165
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:56,560
lead to black holes as opposed to neutron stars. And from that, you can get a prediction that the

166
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:05,040
heaviest stable neutron star can't be more than two solar masses. And there's, and the reason

167
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:09,760
is some complicated thing about the strange core, if I won't bore you with, unless you really, really

168
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:16,240
want. But the thing is that recently, there's better and better evidence that there are some

169
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:25,360
neutron stars up in 20, I'm sorry, two solar masses, 2.2, and so forth. And if those hold up,

170
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:37,280
then my theory or my hypothesis is falsified. And I will proudly say so.

171
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,360
Yeah, you talk about that a lot in the book. You talk about, you know, different gamma-ray

172
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:50,400
burst signatures that could be falsified as of 2006. You have other tests that could be,

173
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:56,720
you describe them as very exciting variation in the fine structure constant. You point out

174
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:02,160
as very exciting. And I've, I know that you have extreme, you know, integrity in all ways,

175
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,360
not only personally, but because you, you know, because I know you personally,

176
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,600
but also because publicly, you've talked about how this has gone away, that there's no,

177
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,640
you've stated that you've kind of abandoned that, that hope. And you admit that it was a hope back

178
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:21,920
in the early part of the, of the, you know, of the 2000s, that these fine structure constant could

179
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:27,440
be revelatory of new physics, but now it's ruled out. And you accept that and you move on.

180
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,320
I wonder, you know, when I first started hearing about you from my, from my best friend, Stefan,

181
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,760
you know, I always thought that, you know, when I first learned about you, it was like

182
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:44,560
what Stephen Hawking reputedly said about Jacob Zeldovich. When he met him, he thought that Zeldovich

183
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:50,960
was like Burbaki, like a collective, a set of people. And I thought that about Smolin. I thought

184
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:56,720
Smolin was like Satoshi Nakamura or whoever that guy is who supposedly or collective came up with

185
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:02,880
Bitcoin or blockchain. I want to ask you, you put out three or four papers recently. And some of

186
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:08,000
them with Stefan, some of them solo papers, this voluminous effort, I think you're writing a paper

187
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,920
right now. I'd like to see your hands, Lee, could you put your hands up so I know that you're not

188
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:16,960
typing out a paper as we're having this lovely interview. But I want to ask you, what would

189
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:22,640
a theory of everything look like? Would it be the semi classical Wheeler DeWitt equation that would

190
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:28,960
be fundamental? Would it be the Schrodinger equation? If gravity is fundamental, some say the

191
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:34,560
Schrodinger equation. If gravity is emergent, some say it's the latter. Your recent paper is so

192
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:39,680
fascinating. You have one called the quantum mechanics of the present written with Clea Verde.

193
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:48,080
And the other one, the symbiotic emergence of space and the quantum. That one is a solo paper.

194
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:53,920
Let's talk about that firstly, please. What does it mean for space to become emergent? What does

195
00:21:53,920 --> 00:22:03,280
that even mean? What it means is that the organization of space, of things moving in space,

196
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:12,080
is not fundamental. It's real, for sure. Of course, we see it. But it's not fundamental. And what I

197
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:20,960
mean is that I'm looking, like many of our colleagues, for a formulation of

198
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:31,360
theory that is a story about the world and how it's made, that will explain the mysteries of

199
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:37,440
quantum mechanics. So I'm a little ambitious, for better or worse, to explain the mysteries of

200
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:45,520
quantum mechanics and resolve those issues like the measurement problem. I want that same structure

201
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:53,440
to explain general relativity. So to be the quantum theory of gravity, although the fundamental

202
00:22:53,440 --> 00:23:02,720
theory that it's coming from is neither quantum mechanics nor gravity. And after a lot of thinking

203
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,360
and talking, here I've been influenced by a number of people. And it's always important.

204
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:14,080
I mean, we never do these things alone. So Fortuni Marco Pulo was the first person who said to me,

205
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:25,040
space does not exist so time can. Space is not in the fundamental list of things that are there

206
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:30,480
all the way down. But time is. For example, space time is in some fundamental way a different thing

207
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:39,520
than matter. And if space time is an emergent concept, then it's not really clear what you

208
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:44,480
would mean by unification. Surely it would not be the unification of matter with gravity.

209
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:50,720
It might be a way to get gravity out of matter that would be a different sort of,

210
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,320
I guess you could think of it as a unification scenario, but it's a bit different than what

211
00:23:54,320 --> 00:24:00,880
people are considering now. I see. And Roberto Manguibara Hunger, who is a Brazilian philosopher,

212
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:09,760
was interested in the same kind of things. And we wrote it was hard, but we wrote a very interesting

213
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:18,000
book together. That book is called The Singular Universe. And the basic idea of that theory,

214
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:26,080
that theory is now called the causal theory of views. And the basic idea of that theory comes from

215
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:33,280
Leibniz, the philosopher. And it's that, and it's going to sound a little weird, it's that

216
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:41,600
the universe is composed of partial views of itself. So what I mean is that at every event,

217
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:48,480
and this is a theory of events and the causes between events. There might be two events here,

218
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:53,280
which in some sense are the cause of a third event, which is a cause of the fourth event.

219
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:03,600
And each event has a past, has the things that led up to causing it. And I call that the view,

220
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:13,520
that's far from Leibniz. And I take the set of all the views from all the events in the universe

221
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:24,240
to be what the universe is. And then I apply laws to those. And the main idea

222
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:31,280
there came from work in common with Julian Barber a long time ago,

223
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:38,400
which is to measure the complexity of some complex system, whether it's a city or an economy,

224
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:46,480
or a piece of quantum space and time, by making the views from different events or different

225
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:54,160
situations, may that be as diverse as possible. And you can write down a numerical measure of that.

226
00:25:54,160 --> 00:26:03,360
And that we take as the quantity that gets extremized to give you the equations of motion.

227
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,840
Physics is often organized in such a way that physics and quantity that gets

228
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:19,360
extremized and minimized. That's called the action. And so the theory has an action which is related

229
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:28,000
to what we call between the variety. Now, the one last thing I have to say about how this goes

230
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:34,160
together is that if you don't have space, you don't have distances between things,

231
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:40,000
you don't have functions, you don't have fields, you don't have derivatives. So how are you going

232
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:47,520
to write down dynamics? All the things that we'll go into are writing down some law of a field or

233
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:54,560
a particle, involve distances or derivatives or fields. And so we don't have any of that,

234
00:26:54,560 --> 00:27:00,800
but what we can do is compare the views. We can ask, you look around where you are,

235
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:08,240
I look around where I am, and that there's a mathematical language to record that view,

236
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:16,160
and then they can be compared. And so the whole dynamics that I developed is based on those

237
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:25,120
comparisons. So that's the basic idea. Then what happens in that paper with, unfortunately,

238
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:32,080
too many technicalities and so forth, is I derive quantum mechanics from those ideas.

239
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,880
Interesting. Now, you mentioned Julian Barbour, he's an upcoming guest

240
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:43,840
on the Into the Impossible podcast, and I asked him to ask a question of you,

241
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:52,720
and then he responded, and then I will ask you to ask him a question that I will convey through

242
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:57,920
me to him. So his question to you, if you're willing to play this game of time traveling

243
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:04,800
questions, this is a very inefficient way to use the internet, Lee. I hope you appreciate how

244
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:10,800
time inefficient this is to talk about time in this way. But anyway, Lee, Julian asks you with

245
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:18,160
warm regards he sends to you. If time is fundamentally, what is it like? What are its attributes?

246
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:27,840
Very good. So what we say, and this is in the work we did with Marina Cortes,

247
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:36,000
developing a prior structure to the theory that was based on slamming, what we say is that

248
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:42,880
the business of time, so I'm not going to define, I'm going to duck it, I'm going to say

249
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:51,920
that the business or the work of time is to continually make new events which make up,

250
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:59,440
so what I want to say, what time is like, is what we experience. That is, we experience the

251
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:06,560
momentary present and the passage of those moments when new things happen and new things happen.

252
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:14,320
And that's the business or the mechanism of time to keep choosing what new things get made

253
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,720
and what they, and therefore that chooses what their costs look like.

254
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:26,560
I talked to Frank Wilczak about time and his basic thesis is that time and entropy are

255
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:35,120
somehow fundamentally linked. Carlo feels this way as well that the Clausius equation of delta S

256
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:42,480
is greater than or equal to zero, entropy is, and that things change and that Frank then supplements

257
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:49,920
that equation with the fact that a clock measures something that is changing and time is what we

258
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:55,760
call the change in something. So it's sort of a tautology, but it's almost the best that we can

259
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:02,880
do. So clocks measure time and time is what measure, clocks measure changing time and time is what

260
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:14,160
clocks measure. And so, but to my opinion, because microscopic physics is reversible, except at the

261
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:18,960
moment of quantum measurement, it may be just like with the twin paradox, and you know I have twins

262
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,360
and I get to do experiments on twins all the time, something I share with a lot of physicists, David

263
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:30,240
Kaiser, Sabina Hossenfelder, Peter Diamandes, we all have twins, some of us have Boy Girl twins,

264
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:36,880
and that makes it even more fun. But anyway, you know, the kind of the classic twin paradox

265
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:42,160
which you talk about in your book on Einstein and the unfinished revolution at some level,

266
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:48,480
the question is, you know, two twins set out, one sets out at close to the speed of light,

267
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:53,840
turns around after a rocket voyage and comes back to Earth, the other twin gets, you know,

268
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:58,480
seems to have aged a lot on Earth, even though they seem to be moving at relativistic speeds,

269
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:03,120
each one experiences the other one moving relativistically, but it's the one that undergoes

270
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:08,880
the acceleration when he or she turns back and comes back. So at that moment, that instantaneous

271
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:15,120
moment, it's almost as if all the acceleration of time takes place. And I wonder, is that not

272
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:20,640
possible on the micro scale? In other words, yes, the microscopic laws of physics are immutable,

273
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,240
they're time irreversible, until you do a measurement. And then that measurement, that's

274
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:29,440
where all the time, you know, directionality of time takes place. Here's how I've been thinking

275
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:39,120
about it lately. And which is some of which comes from that last book, Einstein's Unfinished

276
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:46,000
Revolution. And some of it is recent work with another collaborator, he was clearly over a day.

277
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:57,680
And, and it was basically her idea. So she came to me and she said, so I start, I think,

278
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:04,880
I worry about the distinction between the past, the present, and the future. And so,

279
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:12,400
um, my friend Carlo and lots of people believe that there's no objective distinction between

280
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:21,120
the past, present, and the future. And I do, I think that the time is now, now is real. And,

281
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:31,680
and that that matters to stating the laws of physics. And the question is certainly the

282
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:37,600
present is real, but is the past is the future? And how does this relate to quantum mechanics?

283
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:44,720
So clearly his idea, which turned out when we looked into it, to, to have quite a legacy,

284
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:55,200
which I'll come to, is that the future realm is indefinite. And everything that from quantum

285
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:01,440
physics is indefinite, that is a part of the superposition, click go this way, click go this way,

286
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:07,040
is part of the future. That is the wave function, the quantum state is a description of the future.

287
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:16,880
And what the present is, is the resolution of indefiniteness and ambiguities to definiteness is,

288
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:26,080
because the past is always only definite. And I was really interested in that and shook up by that.

289
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:32,080
And then I started to ask some friends, and it turns out that Heisenberg said this

290
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:39,920
quite precisely. It's not, it's hard to find, but Heisenberg said this in Schrodinger and Freeman

291
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:45,120
Dyson, quite at length in one quote you can find, which of course we put in the paper.

292
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:56,640
So that's, and this is a new idea, so it could be wrong, but I'm kind of, I find it very interesting,

293
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:07,440
this idea that, that what the present is, is the resolution of indefiniteness and ambiguities.

294
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,680
And so let's play, let's think about that more.

295
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,200
Yeah, I wonder if, you know, some of the most interesting things in physics come about because

296
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:25,600
of anomalies. And those anomalies are really the things that make you sit up and notice, as you

297
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:31,120
know, I'm a pilot and, you know, an anomaly in the cockpit is a flashing red light, you know, and

298
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:35,680
you ignore that at your peril. And I think, you know, those are some of the greatest gifts that

299
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:41,200
physicists have. And one of the greatest gifts that we got was in the 1950s, when we noticed the

300
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:47,760
parody and chirality of nature was not a perfectly obeyed symmetry. But we do think, you know,

301
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,400
correct me if I'm wrong, that the combination of discrete symmetries, charge, parody, and time

302
00:34:52,400 --> 00:35:00,080
reversal is respected. But I wonder, this is work you did with Joao Magaizio and others on

303
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:06,560
chiral gravitational waves in 2008 that had some startling predictions. But I remember one line

304
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:13,360
in particular that Stefan really drove home to me was that you make the claim that if the laws of

305
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:19,600
physics are unified, and if the electroweak sector, you know, violates parody, as we know it does,

306
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:25,200
then if gravity becomes unified with the electroweak sector, then it's almost unavoidable,

307
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,760
that gravity will have some chirality. And I guess this is characterized by this

308
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:34,000
Emiritese parameter, etc. Can you say more as you're thinking on that evolve? That was one of the

309
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,120
most, you know, kind of, you know, earth shattering bombshells that I ever heard, because it meant

310
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:44,640
that in my field, we might see bigger chiral anomalies in the cosmic microwave background that

311
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:51,120
might illuminate physics beyond the standard model indicative of Lorentz invariance violation,

312
00:35:51,120 --> 00:36:01,280
which is more startling to me than inflation. Yeah, me too. I think I don't know if I have

313
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:08,560
anything new to say. I'm very grateful for your interest and other observers who have taken these

314
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:20,320
things seriously enough to really look for them. But let me, here's something which fascinates me.

315
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:29,600
Generalitity. And I'm not assuming that our listeners, your listeners are experts in physics,

316
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:36,320
but generalitity has a reputation of being difficult, partly because the Einstein equation

317
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:42,320
is really complicated. And it's a function of this thing, the metric that measures distances,

318
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:47,440
but you've got the inverse of the metric and the determinant of the metric in the square root,

319
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:57,520
the determinant of the metric. And it's a mess to compute with, and it's sure a mess to make

320
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:05,600
quite a mechanical. So what Abay used turned out, we didn't know that, we didn't know that at the

321
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:17,280
time, but a Polish physicist was a refugee to Mexico named Plobanski had discovered something

322
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:24,080
wonderful, which is that you can look at the Einstein equations from a kind of different

323
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:32,560
point of view, which is chiral, that is where you only focus on how the left-hand and neutrinos

324
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:39,440
are react to a gravitational wave, and not the right-hand and neutrinos. And if you do that,

325
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:46,480
you get equations which are just quadratic equations, period. There's no determinants,

326
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:51,360
there's no square roots, there's no inverses, it's just quadratic equations. And if something

327
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:57,200
were simpler than that, it would be linear, and then we get those linear or linear equations

328
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:03,680
we can solve. So it's as simple as it can get while still being non-trivial.

329
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:14,000
And loop quantum gravity, the reason why all those ideas worked is because Abay rediscovered

330
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:22,640
Plobanski's formulation. So now, so that makes me wonder, does nature know about this?

331
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:32,080
And so for example, Roger Penrose's great construction, I mean he's done so many great

332
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:38,720
things, but to grade it, in my opinion, is Twister theory, which has found a lot of use in particle

333
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:46,320
physics and string theory and quantum gravity, but of its own is a very radical idea. And Twister

334
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:52,880
theory has this chirality built into it. The left-handed gravitational waves are described in

335
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:57,920
a way that's different than the right-handed gravitational wave. Interesting. So that was

336
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:03,280
an earlier yes, and you do speak about that in the book, and also Roger's been a guest four times on

337
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:09,360
the show as well. And his 90th birthday is coming up, and I'm delighted to be asked to speak on

338
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:17,440
behalf of that wonderful occasion. And that'll be something to celebrate in August, I believe,

339
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:22,640
is his 90th birthday. It's quite amazing. And thinking about his late-grade colleague, Stephen

340
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:30,320
Hawking, who passed away three years ago, it's hard to believe. And this notion that he kind of

341
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:36,160
died without having unified quantum mechanics with gravity, I've been having this provocative

342
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:44,000
statement, Lee, and at the risk of insulting my mentor, Lee Smolin and friend, I don't know that

343
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,840
gravity has to be unified with quantum mechanics. I mean, after all, there are only two situations

344
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:55,600
to my knowledge at which the quantization of gravity, the failure of gravity to play nice

345
00:39:55,600 --> 00:40:00,800
with quantum mechanics becomes important. And that's near a singularity in a black hole,

346
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:05,520
and near the origin of the universe, if indeed it began with a singularity, which Sir Roger,

347
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,840
as you know, does not believe it did, and Paul Steinhardt does not believe it did,

348
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:14,000
and many others do not believe it did. Neil Turok, your colleague, does not believe it did.

349
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:19,120
And so there's one very questionable scenario that could get ticked off, that we don't have to

350
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:25,440
worry about quantum gravity in that scenario. And a black hole once below the event horizon is

351
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:32,000
you know better than almost anybody else. We cannot observe the details, what happens in

352
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:37,680
the singularity inside the event horizon stays inside the event horizon. So why do we care? I

353
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:43,360
mean, would there be any signature of quantum gravity outside the event horizon? And that would

354
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:48,400
be the own, or are there other scenarios in addition to physics beyond the event horizon

355
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,880
that is relevant to the mandate that we must quantize gravity?

356
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:59,600
Very good. So I'm going to give you another reason. I mean, I'm very interested in the idea of quantum

357
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:06,320
gravity. I don't think there's an open and shut case that we shouldn't quantify. But here's something

358
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:15,120
I've been fascinated by since graduate school days. And in, I'll tell the background, in graduate

359
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:22,480
school days, I got interested in Einstein, I was always interested in Einstein. And I had a friend

360
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:28,880
who was a historian of physics, Amelia Michelle Cohn. And she made a proposal to me. She said,

361
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:37,600
why don't we read all of Einstein's papers from the beginning, at least the first 10 years or so.

362
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:44,080
And very few of them were in English except the three or four classes. But why don't we start

363
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:50,720
with his very first paper, which was on thermodynamics and light, and read with her

364
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:59,040
translator and read forward. And so we did that. And there was a thing that was very apparent

365
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:05,600
as we did that, which is that he was enormously interested in the consequences of applying

366
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:14,880
thermodynamic ideas to light. And therefore, he was very interested in the situation, which is

367
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:22,080
called the ultraviolet catastrophe, where if you make a box with conductors, and you must,

368
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:30,080
you must actually know how to do this. And you put some light, you have a little hole,

369
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:36,880
and you put some light in, and you close the hole, the light bounces around. It doesn't interact with

370
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:42,400
itself, it interacts with the walls where the conductors are, and it thermalizes itself. It

371
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:47,600
bounces, and bounces, and bounces, and bounces, and thermalizes itself. And then you open a little

372
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:52,560
hole, and you put a spectrograph there, and it comes out the black body spectrum.

373
00:42:54,640 --> 00:43:01,600
And that was really interesting for Einstein, because the black body spectrum, without even

374
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:07,440
having the form of the spectrum, although he did actually, of course, this was after Planck, so he

375
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:16,080
knew Planck's guess. And it was obvious that classical physics couldn't explain the fall-off

376
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:25,120
at the high frequency, either the minus h bar omega over the temperature, basically.

377
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:35,360
And this was a reason why you had to quantize electromagnetism, was to prevent that

378
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:46,560
spectrum from just going out unstably to infinity. And so we read that in several different versions,

379
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:55,040
and I thought, I wonder if you could make gravity waves do that. That is, if you could make gravity

380
00:43:55,040 --> 00:44:01,200
waves, put them in a box, and force them into a catastrophe, which you had to save by saying there

381
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:08,000
were gravitons. And then h bar omega, because the energy applied to gravity as well, to gravitational

382
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:16,960
waves as well. And you know what? You can't do it. You can't make the analog of conducting

383
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:26,240
planes, which reflect and keep confined gravitational waves. You can show,

384
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:35,360
and I managed, I'm not that good at this kind of stuff, but I managed a derailation of the

385
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:44,800
efficiency of reflection of gravitational waves off a wall made of any material. And as long as

386
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:51,040
the speed of sound of that material is less than the speed of light, and the thing is not a black hole

387
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:58,720
in the energy, the positivity of energy, the conditions are met, then you can show that the

388
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:05,280
efficiency is bounded way, way, way away from one. And the gravitational wave just sorters outside

389
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:14,480
the box. Never is forced to come to equilibrium. And you can even build on that and show that in

390
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:20,800
the history of the universe of gravitational waves, you'll never come to equilibrium. That is,

391
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:30,960
at any time since the Big Bang and the Big Bang picture, the mean free time of gravitational waves

392
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:38,560
is longer than the cosmic time. And you can show it in equality. So I think that's a little,

393
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,840
there's an interesting bit of physics that supports you.

394
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:53,280
Interesting. And if you look out at kind of other tests that one could devise, it's natural to kind

395
00:45:53,280 --> 00:46:01,680
of look at, look for tests that could potentially be crisp or decisive tests, as there's a word for

396
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:09,840
this in Latin, you know, critical tests that could not, the theory could not survive otherwise,

397
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:15,040
but to pass this test. The bending of light by massive objects, the Eddington experiment is

398
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:20,080
often cited as such an example, even though many experimentalists doubt that it was really,

399
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:26,000
truly feasible in the technology back in 1919 to truly verify the level of precision that

400
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,280
Einstein achieved. But nevertheless, we won't get into that. People can read your book.

401
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:35,920
And Jim Gates's books and other books about Einstein, of which there are many. But I want to

402
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:41,920
turn to the other aspect, which kind of fascinates me and also dismayes me about string theory,

403
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:47,200
but about kind of all theories of everything. And our mutual friend, Max Tegmark, has written

404
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:53,200
about these, and that's really the multiverse. And this is quite disturbing in some ways,

405
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:58,800
especially not the least of which are the multiverses that Max speaks about,

406
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:03,760
you know, the kind of four levels of multiverses that can exist, including a multiverse in which,

407
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:10,400
you know, the laws of nature can vary from string vacuum to string vacuum. And this is part of

408
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:15,280
the fight I had with Michio Kaku. Of course, you know, he was a gentleman, even if I wasn't.

409
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:21,680
But the argument was, you know, I said to him, you know, you say it's not fair to test string

410
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:29,840
theory, because I have to tell you which of the 10 to the 500th or more vacua we live in. And he

411
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:34,800
said, that's just like solving Newton's equations. How many solutions are there in a Newton's equation?

412
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,640
I said, there's an infinite number of solutions to Newton's equation. How many solutions to

413
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:42,560
Maxwell's equation? There's an infinite number. What do you need to solve them? He asked me. I

414
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:47,520
said, boundary conditions, initial conditions. But I said, the situation seems hopeless in string

415
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:52,240
theory. In even more hopeless, maybe, than Max Tegmark would admit. And I think I've discovered

416
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:58,160
a fifth level of the multiverse, Lee, if you'll indulge me and forgive me. Because as I think

417
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:03,360
Rabbi used to say, the Nobel Prize should go to someone who doesn't discover a new particle

418
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:07,840
back in the 30s. But in this case, I think the Nobel Prize should go to someone who doesn't

419
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:13,680
discover a new multiverse. I'm worried that there could be a type of multiverse where not only the

420
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:18,320
laws of physics change, but the laws of logic change. In other words, why should it be that

421
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:26,560
Modus Tolens holds in some universe or two plus two equals four in another universe? And he claims,

422
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:34,240
no, no, no, that was a foolish question. But if there are 10 to the 500 different laws of physics,

423
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:37,120
why should there not be 10 to the 500 different laws of mathematics?

424
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:46,560
So first of all, of course, there are different, I don't know how many there are, but there are

425
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:55,360
different versions of set theory and logic and mathematics, depending on how you answer questions

426
00:48:55,360 --> 00:49:04,320
like the continuum hypothesis and the exclusive middle. And there's a whole bunch of different

427
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:11,760
logics in different worlds of mathematics. And that I find that fascinating. Since I'm not

428
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:16,160
a Platonist, I don't believe I don't have to believe that they're real. And any of them are real.

429
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:28,480
But they're, they're, they're, they're structures by which we reason. And it's what you say is

430
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:37,280
interesting. And what I don't know if it's worrying, but it's interesting. And I could come back to

431
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:42,160
that because, because I would think a lot about mathematics and I worry about, especially since

432
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:53,520
I'm not a Platonist. Right. So I do want to talk about this, this third paper that you wrote,

433
00:49:54,400 --> 00:50:01,040
co-author with Stefan and six other authors, Geron Lanier, Geron Lanier. Can you say something

434
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:07,280
about him? He's an interesting character. He's, his, his, his affiliation is listed as Microsoft

435
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:12,240
Research in Redmond, Washington. I once met him in Berkeley, California. Can you say something

436
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:16,320
about Geron? I know he's a friend of yours and Stefan's, but he's an interesting character. Is

437
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:25,600
he not? He's a very interesting person. And I, I feel very lucky to have him as a friend and we're,

438
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:37,760
we're very good friends. Geron is speaking about auto-didact, didactics. Geron is almost entirely

439
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:52,960
self-educated. He went to a few schools a few times. He is wonderfully imaginative,

440
00:50:52,960 --> 00:51:00,960
wonderfully, he's really quick. He's, he's a great communicator. He's a great writer. He's one of the

441
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:08,720
few people I think of as, you know, this class of people who are endlessly original and have

442
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:15,760
endlessly important things to say. And he does have a lot that's very important to say, whether it's

443
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:22,480
about thinking about artificial intelligence or the role in the economy of the internet companies.

444
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:28,480
And so, and lots and lots of other things besides we were talking about yesterday

445
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:41,120
about a whole lot of these things. Yeah, yeah, go ahead. So here's how that came, came to be.

446
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:48,480
So first of all, I have been interested, as we mentioned, in the idea that the laws of physics

447
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:54,480
could change for a long time. And there was cosmological natural selection, if we discuss,

448
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:59,280
I had another approach or have another approach called the principle of precedence.

449
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:05,920
And Geron is interested in that idea. And over several, maybe even many years,

450
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:14,080
Geron and Stefan are also friends and they're both musicians. One thing, Geron plays an incredible

451
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:23,920
variety of musical instruments from all over the world. And there are so many stories to tell

452
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:34,400
that I'll skip doing that. I'll keep doing that now. Well, there's one, let me just bracket this.

453
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:40,560
This is the time Geron took Stefan and I to meet one that called me. And let me just use this.

454
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:46,560
Can you speak a little closer to the microphone? There's a time that Geron took Stefan and I to

455
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:52,880
meet one that called me. Oh, that's right. Which stands out in my as one of the very fortunate

456
00:52:53,760 --> 00:53:02,160
experiences I've had. Geron has, Geron is, among other things, a computer scientist.

457
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:06,640
So we didn't even get to that. He is credited with inventing virtual reality.

458
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:16,880
And his position in Microsoft, I don't really understand it, but it seems to allow him complete

459
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:23,040
freedom to do whatever he wants and think about whatever he wants. But he's also involved clearly

460
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:33,520
in projects there. And so anyway, over years, he and Stefan and I talked about a variety of

461
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:39,680
different ideas. And I don't know where the key idea in the paper comes from. I try to think of it.

462
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:48,240
The key idea in the paper is that we can talk about the laws of nature

463
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:56,080
learning and learning the laws and finding the its way around those

464
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:02,960
vacuums that you're worried about to one that is somehow benefits the universe best.

465
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:09,840
And this sounds crazy. And what we're going to argue is the following.

466
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:17,680
There's a lot in that paper that's an 80 page paper about what learning is because we had to do

467
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:24,720
it because it couldn't find you anywhere. But let me skip that and say that people are interested

468
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:33,760
in these machine learning algorithms. And let's just give me that what they do is to learn.

469
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:39,840
They learn facial recognition, they learn pattern recognition, they learn bunches of other things.

470
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:45,520
And let's not get into the epistemology of what it means to say that one of those machines or

471
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:52,400
algorithms learn something. You just give it to me that they learn. And I'm going to take

472
00:54:53,360 --> 00:55:00,560
your favorite candidate for the laws of nature as long as they're of the form of something like

473
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:05,200
general relativity and something like gauge fields and fermions and scanners.

474
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:15,440
And we're going to map that theory into the learning machines and machine learning algorithms.

475
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:22,880
And we discovered that map. I don't remember why we were looking for it.

476
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:29,680
But at some point it became clear that there was a map. And the map uses a technical result

477
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:35,760
which I knew and which has to do with a class of models called matrix models.

478
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:43,920
And that's just the technicality that was used. So we demonstrated that result.

479
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:55,760
And then we have thought about what devices you could make that could be mapped to the

480
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:07,040
laws of nature to investigate this idea. There were seven people on the paper. Everyone was essential.

481
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:18,960
And they range from a senior Microsoft computer scientist who was kind of

482
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:27,280
bringing in all of the knowledge about machine learning. Will Cunningham,

483
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:34,080
who's a very talented young theoretical physicist who unfortunately were losing

484
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:44,160
at the moment to the world of startups. And it was a lot of fun. It was really hard. I haven't

485
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:51,840
worked on anything. You work in collaborations all the time. And for me it was kind of a new

486
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:58,960
experience to work in a collaboration that much. And it really did work and it came together. But

487
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:04,560
it took a year. That's a full year meeting together three times a week.

488
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:10,160
That's great. And you don't know what's in the Cunningham floor. There's a whole bunch of stuff.

489
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:15,680
Yeah, I believe it. Yeah, so I'll try to get Geron and Stefan on the podcast at some point too.

490
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:20,080
Stefan's been on three or four times already, but I've never met, I've never had Geron on.

491
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:25,680
I'm going to have Nathan Mirwald on who was director of research at Microsoft for a while and is

492
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:31,920
kind of an autodidact. And maybe that'll segue to my final question for this interview. I hope

493
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:38,560
you'll give us the opportunity to talk more about physics and in the intervening month or so before

494
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:44,400
we can talk again about maybe we'll do a dedicated cosmology talk next time. You'll probably write

495
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:52,640
10 other papers and three books. But I do want to talk just once about, I see you as an autodidact.

496
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:58,800
You've written papers in economics. You've written papers in, as you say, set theory and physics and

497
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:07,120
cosmology. You've written six books to date. And speaking of learning, as we just did with

498
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:13,120
computer learning, do you think you can teach creativity, Lee? Can you teach someone to be

499
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:20,400
imaginative, to be creative? Is there a nature-nurture thing? You just have to be born with it.

500
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:32,880
That's a very good question. And I don't know. I certainly believed that it was teachable most

501
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:41,520
of my life. And I would hope that that's true, because being creative is a great thing. And I

502
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:50,320
would hope that everybody, however their life was organized, had access to that. And it

503
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:57,600
doesn't mean that you're good at it. I mean, I'm not a good musician. I got, unlike Stefan,

504
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:04,320
he is a good musician. I got good enough to play with the people who are really good. And then it

505
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:13,760
was like, okay, that's not my genre. But I still have a few guitars and still play them sometimes.

506
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:26,720
And I'm working with two people now that are unusual people to be working with. And they're

507
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:39,440
endlessly creative and smart. And I don't know where it comes from. I, you know, Jared, Stefan,

508
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:48,480
Thalia, so many people I've been fortunate enough to know, have their own ideas about everything.

509
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:57,360
They look at the world, the same world I look at. They read the same stuff. And they come up with

510
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:04,320
stuff just, it's like turning on a faucet. Stuff that's worth thinking about and worth listening to.

511
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:13,920
And I don't know, I don't know where that comes from. There are certainly cranes that you can't

512
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:30,480
teach it. And the, but I'm going to, I'm going to take a left turn on you. Here's what I think is

513
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:37,360
changeable. And, and I hope I don't sound like, I don't know, I mean, some moralistic

514
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:46,080
something. And people are going to look like he said that. But let me try it. I think character

515
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:55,600
matters enormously. And being in this crisis that we've been, I see it every day. And I think that

516
01:00:55,920 --> 01:01:08,320
the ability to see clearly what's going on around you and take responsibility for it and think about

517
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:15,120
it. The ability to follow your own compass, to not care as fine and put it, whatever people think.

518
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:26,480
And I think, and I have a friend I've learned a lot from, St. Clair Simen, who's a sculptor,

519
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:32,480
who's a great sculptor. And so I'm going to leave it with a kind of quote of St. Clair.

520
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:43,200
St. Clair used to tell me that, that you get sort of into your twenties for free.

521
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:51,200
And if you're, if you're going to go on and become useful and really make a contribution

522
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:58,560
with what you do, it really starts to matter what your character is and how much you're willing to

523
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:12,160
be on the edge and take risks and question yourself. And by 50 and 60, it really, it really

524
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:20,400
shows. It really starts to show. He was probably 40 something. And I'm about 10 years younger than him.

525
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:24,160
And then I'll say something else. You don't have to keep this in the tape.

526
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:33,680
No, it's great. But this is, I'm saying this to you from him anyway. Unlike you,

527
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:45,440
we had children late and had to be and talked about it and thought about it.

528
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:51,920
And he had his daughter a few years before we had time. And he said to me,

529
01:02:52,880 --> 01:03:01,440
you have no idea what you're giving to the world by having a child. You're un-murdering somebody.

530
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:10,320
And you're giving this to the much higher degree than I am. But I am certainly fully

531
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:15,840
involved. And it is a great thing to do. You know, that's, it's wonderful that you say that,

532
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:19,840
Lee. And actually I was going to close with this to give us some time between our next

533
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:24,880
conversation. But I did want to say that I once heard, you know, Sam Harris talking about,

534
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:29,840
you know, the impossibility of, you know, teleportation and, you know, time travel.

535
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:33,520
It's kind of this, this fantasy that human beings have. And I said, no, that's, that's actually

536
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:37,840
a lie. I didn't say it to him because, you know, he won't pick up the phone when I call him. But,

537
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:42,720
but anyway, I said, actually, there is such a thing as teleportation. It's just you can't

538
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:49,120
teleport yourself. You teleport your values, you teleport your ethics, you teleport your character

539
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:53,280
into the future. And it's called children. And it doesn't even have to be your biological

540
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:59,280
children, Lee. It's your ideological children. And I count myself. And I don't blame you. But

541
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:04,960
I count myself as kind of one of your ideological children. So, you know, I have a great, you know,

542
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:09,360
friend, you know, her name is Melanie Notkin. She's known as the savvy auntie. She can't have

543
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:13,600
children. She didn't have children, whatever. She has influenced thousands of millions of people,

544
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:17,200
even though she didn't have biological children. So I am blessed to have biological children.

545
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:24,000
But even if someone is not, you can act like a parent. You can communicate and thereby doing

546
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:30,160
teleport yourself into the future. And what else is there, Lee? That's time travel. And, and,

547
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:33,760
and you've done that for me and you've done that for millions of people. I just want to thank you

548
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:39,520
so much, Lee, for being, being such a great human being and being an influence on me even long before

549
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:43,760
you knew me. And, and again, you don't get any of the blame for anything bad I do with your good

550
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:52,480
influence. Whoa, Brian, that's the, thank you. I have no words. Thank you. Well, Lee, thank you

551
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:59,120
so much for going into the impossible. I hope you enjoyed this episode with Lee Smolen. If you did,

552
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:03,920
you'll definitely want to check out this episode with Lee and Eric Weinstein. You'll also want to

553
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:09,440
check out other theories of everything, including critics of string theory, just like Lee, featuring
