1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,360
Let's do it, as you see us on the screen.

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:05,360
It's just going to be the center panel.

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:05,860
Yep.

4
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:06,840
All right.

5
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,920
Welcome to a special episode of the Impossible

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,320
Podcast, which is a series of great scholars

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,520
that I have had on the podcast both multiple times now

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,080
and green, Professor and colleague here at UC San Diego.

9
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,080
And my friend, Longtime, most popular.

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,960
I think that's a great connection.

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,120
I'm at the portal podcast.

12
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,560
And the physics who recently had a very, very popular episode

13
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,480
said that we called physics is fine.

14
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,640
And it was based on a Twitter thread

15
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,800
storm that came out at the end of December in which Dan

16
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,400
highlighted discoveries in physics

17
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,280
that had not been really rewarded with the accolade

18
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,360
of the Nobel Prize, yet, perhaps never,

19
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,200
but at least as of the moment, had not been rewarded

20
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,800
with that particular remuneration.

21
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,720
And there's been a lot of controversy, as I said,

22
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,920
around the description of physics as having stagnated.

23
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,280
Most forcefully or vocally by Sabina Hossenfelder, also

24
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,520
eight-time guest on the podcast, just behind Eric's record

25
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,640
set for this particular event.

26
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,440
But I wanted to have both gentlemen here together

27
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,840
to discuss the future of physics as they see it

28
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,680
and what's right with physics, what we could do with physics,

29
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,600
or what we could change or modify,

30
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,920
what opportunities there are, and sort of moderate that

31
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,400
from the perspective of a simple experimental cosmologist

32
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,280
and my perspective on things.

33
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,800
So we're going to talk about particle physics,

34
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,360
experiment theory.

35
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,280
We're going to talk about unification of forces

36
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,480
in fields, perhaps.

37
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:45,400
And we're going to have it, as I said, a nice clean fight.

38
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,120
We're going to go TOE to TOE.

39
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:48,960
You did it.

40
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,440
I did it.

41
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,240
I made that joke.

42
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,240
You didn't think I would.

43
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,920
So I think I'll start with Dan, just

44
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,160
to recapitulate from our previous episode that aired last week

45
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:01,760
and find it, and the channel archives called Physics is Fine.

46
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,800
What was the motivation for that particular tweet storm?

47
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,840
Yeah, so thanks for having me on.

48
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,680
It's nice to get a chance to talk to both of you.

49
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,320
So the motivation behind the thread

50
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,640
was to articulate some of the things

51
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,320
that I picked up on being an active researcher that I thought

52
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,400
were important events for me in understanding how the world works

53
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,880
and making progress in clearly observational topics

54
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:32,560
like cosmology, but also important theoretical ideas that

55
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,160
had a huge impact on how I see the world that I didn't think

56
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,400
were always well understood or appreciated by people,

57
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,080
like even other researchers outside of their own fields.

58
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,040
So it was just to kind of communicate

59
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,360
the value of what had been happening.

60
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,160
And one of the reasons for that is that as a researcher,

61
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,120
it's really important to know what am I aiming for,

62
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,640
like what would be a result that would really stand out

63
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,320
amongst the best results the past five years.

64
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,360
We'd all like to be Einstein, but just for me,

65
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,600
I just you can't always, you won't always achieve those,

66
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,560
but maybe having a hierarchy of results in your mind

67
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,480
is really important for just gauging where progress,

68
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,440
what counts as progress, what kind of progress is going on.

69
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,200
And Eric, you've been interacting,

70
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,400
you've been interacting and engaging with this said tweet

71
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,160
and also with our friend Sabina and Martin Bauer,

72
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,680
who generously provided a book called No Bell Dreams,

73
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,320
which is somewhere around here.

74
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,480
What was your reaction to this?

75
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,760
You had sort of a provocative comment

76
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,960
that we should just get past the point

77
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,480
that yes, there's been a lot of progress in condensed matter

78
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,840
physics and theoretical astrophysics,

79
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,440
experimental cosmology.

80
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,720
What are you most interested in doing

81
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,600
to move the conversation forward from your perspective?

82
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,680
Thanks for asking.

83
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:55,040
So I'd like to do this in the click-baity kind

84
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,760
of thumbnail sketches.

85
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,320
I was outraged, Dan, frankly, by this tweet storm.

86
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,760
Sorry, it's gonna get a little, a little, fantastic.

87
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,840
I'm bored by all the opening moves.

88
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,200
We have a suite of moves where somebody says

89
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,800
there's a crisis in fundamental physics

90
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,080
and then somebody mishears it and says,

91
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,960
you have no idea what's going on in material science.

92
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,360
It's never been a more exciting time.

93
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,400
You say, that's not what I said.

94
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,600
Well, who's to say what's fundamental?

95
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,480
Is cosmology fundamental?

96
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,200
So this is the sort of weird dance

97
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,640
that people get into at the beginning.

98
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,800
And I've said, I'd rather just say Roy Lopez's

99
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,840
spasky variation and get to the middle game

100
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,840
rather than wasting time on the intro.

101
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,880
So I think it would be appropriate,

102
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,640
given that I'm not a physicist, to seed a bunch of things,

103
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,080
first of all, being that I'm not a physicist.

104
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,920
I think that the issue is not about physics in the large.

105
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:49,080
It's really about the sort of core central issue,

106
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,880
which people are very squeamish about now,

107
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,800
because nobody wants to say that any field

108
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,280
is any more important than any other,

109
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,840
which is ridiculous.

110
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,660
There is a central core of fundamental physics,

111
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:01,720
which is the thing that scratches the itch we have.

112
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,380
When we're not physicists, we wanna know,

113
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,220
what is the universe?

114
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,200
Who am I?

115
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,480
Where, why am I here?

116
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,480
How does the world work?

117
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,600
What is this place made of?

118
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,480
And those questions have stagnated,

119
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,240
and I'm sort of somewhat arbitrarily,

120
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,400
but not that arbitrarily,

121
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,440
tying that to February 1st of 1973

122
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,240
with the publication of the Kobayashi-Moscowa paper,

123
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,280
enlarging the Kibibo angle to three generations.

124
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,480
And I believe there are eight particle theorists left

125
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,360
on Earth who have won a Nobel Prize.

126
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,480
Now that also causes a certain variation in the opening,

127
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,680
because somebody will say, well,

128
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,640
you seem to be very hung up on the Nobel Prize.

129
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,480
It's like, no.

130
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,320
Not more than me.

131
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,800
But the fact is that the Nobel Prize

132
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,480
is a somewhat conservative measure of progress.

133
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,400
And as a conservative measure of progress,

134
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,640
when you're down to your last eight people

135
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,000
who have proven that they are physicists

136
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,100
by being able to make contact with reality at that level,

137
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,280
50 years is a long time.

138
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,120
I think the longest recent drought of this kind

139
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,600
is between 1928 and 47 with the advent of QED by Dirac

140
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,720
as the first real quantum field theory

141
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,840
before the sort of primitive renormalization program

142
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,920
came in and cleared up the ability to compute.

143
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,080
So I absolutely celebrate Dan's tweet storm.

144
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,840
I think that it had lots of great papers,

145
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,600
many of which I knew nothing about.

146
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,000
So I educated myself and I got a chance

147
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
to look at Dan's work a bit.

148
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,960
But that said, one of the things I think

149
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,160
that tweet storm did,

150
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,920
and I think Dan acknowledged it as much,

151
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:43,920
is that it didn't clearly state the results

152
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,560
that would constitute unambiguous change

153
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,520
in fundamental physics.

154
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,960
That is, what is the field content of the world?

155
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,160
What stuff is it that's running around?

156
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,760
Are there new things that we haven't figured out?

157
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,040
What constitutes the new interactions

158
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,200
of the stuff that we have

159
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,500
and the stuff that may come to be?

160
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,560
And the other issue of unification

161
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,760
would be spaces.

162
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,480
So we currently have something called space time

163
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,320
and it's not clear whether there is a problem

164
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,560
with space time itself.

165
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,600
So I would say that Dan did a great service

166
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,080
talking about all the sorts of things

167
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,400
that are not in crisis.

168
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,200
And I wish to seed instantly

169
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,120
that it is not that physics is in crisis,

170
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,800
which is the thing that everybody can understand easily,

171
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,560
but it is the core central issue of what physics can be.

172
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,680
It's meant to be that it excites our imaginations

173
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,480
and our passions, answers philosophical questions

174
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,760
that is in a prolonged state of,

175
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,000
and I would say a necessary self-inflicted crisis.

176
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,240
Well, just before Dan,

177
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,720
you get the opportunity to address that.

178
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,480
So I recently, are you familiar with this essay

179
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,960
by David Foster Wallace called This Is Water?

180
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,080
You're drinking some vodka,

181
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,120
so hopefully you're familiar with it.

182
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,280
So it's a parable of these two fish that are young fish

183
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,280
and they're in the ocean, they're swimming around,

184
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,480
and all of a sudden an older fish comes by

185
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,040
and says, hey boys, how's the water?

186
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,560
He goes on his way.

187
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,520
And then the two fish look at each other,

188
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,480
one says the other one, what the hell is water?

189
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,520
Is that possible?

190
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,080
Let me ask Dan, are we obsessed with space time?

191
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,880
Are we in space time in the same way

192
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,480
that these fish are in water?

193
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:22,480
And are we rightfully to be maybe ashamed

194
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,360
or view it as something to be dispensed with altogether

195
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,040
as I think Einstein or Lorenz or both of them

196
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,040
or neither of them or Nimas have claimed?

197
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,880
What is space time?

198
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,720
Why is that sort of the pinnacle

199
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,160
and how can you see that getting under Eric's skin?

200
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,120
Yeah, I mean, for sure,

201
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,560
that's one of the great questions of science.

202
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:48,360
So we think that space time probably emerges from something

203
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,320
in a lot of examples we've studied like strength theory

204
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,960
where our ultimate hope for resolution

205
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:58,160
of the singularity at the beginning of time

206
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,520
is probably something non-geometric.

207
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,280
If we understand what's going on there,

208
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,480
it will not be in terms of geometry

209
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,840
at least of the kind of space time we experience.

210
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,280
I think the thing I would say is in response to you,

211
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,520
are we unnecessarily obsessed with it?

212
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,600
I do think that there are questions of this nature,

213
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,320
like what happened before the Big Bang?

214
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,880
And some of those questions we don't have the tools to answer.

215
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,760
We don't have data to help guide us.

216
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,520
And even if someone writes down a theory that works,

217
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,240
we may have no way to test it.

218
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,680
Someone can come up with another theory.

219
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,480
And so there is a lot of like,

220
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,600
we're not guaranteed that we're gonna be able to answer

221
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,560
all the questions that are deeply held questions

222
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,120
of humanity going back to eons.

223
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,320
But I do think that like,

224
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,680
so there are aspects of these questions.

225
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,120
I don't think we're guaranteed that we can make progress

226
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,600
on all the questions we'd like to.

227
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:57,440
And what happens at space time when it seems to be,

228
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,360
but the kind of thing we experience on our scale,

229
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,760
does it continue to exist down to these scales?

230
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,320
We'd love to be able to answer that question,

231
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,440
but I also don't think we necessarily are promised

232
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,880
that we'll ever have answers,

233
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,160
or at least in hundreds of years time scale.

234
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,560
And so I don't see that as the benchmark

235
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,200
at which all decisions of progress have to be made.

236
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,760
You know, I guess when I hear that,

237
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,120
I check it against things that I believe.

238
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,760
So one, when you say geometric,

239
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,360
it's not that it will be non-geometric,

240
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,240
it's that it won't be the specific geometry

241
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,080
and you sort of corrected that mid-flight.

242
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:39,240
So if Albert Einstein told us to embrace

243
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,840
semi-Romanian geometry,

244
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,360
it's not simply going to be a semi-Romanian manifold,

245
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,240
which is basically four degrees of freedom

246
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:51,720
together with one set of rulers and four rulers

247
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,440
for each degree of freedom and six protractors between them.

248
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,240
So you have 10 variables that get chosen by an equation.

249
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,000
And then that thing,

250
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,680
to the extent that I understand your point,

251
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,680
it's that there are these singularities.

252
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,360
One is at the beginning of time, if you will,

253
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,560
in the standard Friedman-Robertson-Walker model.

254
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,000
And the other one is at the base of a black hole,

255
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,960
which is the Schwarzschild singularity,

256
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,960
and one modern interpretation

257
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,880
is that the singularities result from crimes and sins

258
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,840
that we don't even know we've committed.

259
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,880
And so we're trying to figure out what to do as penance

260
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,320
so as to remove these singularities.

261
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:31,000
But if I listen to what you're saying very carefully,

262
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,160
I see something which I'm very alarmed by,

263
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,720
which is you're not suspicious,

264
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,240
either one of you, enough of the language,

265
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,800
before speaks to one dimension of time.

266
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:49,440
And only R1 has an ordering in the absence of other structure.

267
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,920
R2, R3, R4 don't have such a thing.

268
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,920
So when there is an arrow of time,

269
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,640
it makes good sense, ordinarily,

270
00:11:55,640 --> 00:12:00,120
to say nothing of pardon, to speak of before.

271
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,720
But if the ultimate structure, as I believe,

272
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,080
has multiple dimensions of time,

273
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:10,520
you will find that the crutch of saying initial conditions

274
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:14,040
has to be replaced by something like boundary conditions.

275
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,600
And in such a situation,

276
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,520
one of the things that's really interesting to me

277
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,840
is that we have the Lagrangian, the equations,

278
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,760
the field content, which is the science.

279
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,920
But we also have this way of talking around it.

280
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,040
And the way in which we have of talking around it

281
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,440
carries a tremendous amount of weight.

282
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,480
And a lot of that, I think,

283
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:38,080
is grooving each generation to fail as its successors failed,

284
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,840
because what we're doing is we're putting

285
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,400
a tremendous amount of pressure saying,

286
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,880
if you don't learn to speak the way we do,

287
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,280
you will not be able to survive to adulthood

288
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,200
to have your own thesis students.

289
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,720
And therefore, you had better learn to talk as we do.

290
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,080
And I think that that's one of the things

291
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,360
that I'm very concerned about.

292
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,960
I don't believe that before

293
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,760
is as simple as we're making out to be.

294
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,360
So I guess I would push back on that.

295
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,520
I mean, I don't think it's, I mean,

296
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:10,000
we can use, it's helpful to use everyday language

297
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,040
and then add, okay, it could be different, right?

298
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,040
Like, it's helpful to start from the things we know are true.

299
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,560
And we can ask questions like,

300
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,480
could there be extra dimensions of time

301
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,040
or even just the evolution from is,

302
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,560
do we know that quantum mechanics

303
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,240
is the only possible way that the world could work?

304
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,600
There are lots of people,

305
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,200
and I include myself in them,

306
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,760
that are interested in pushing the boundaries.

307
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,400
But it also helps to start from a place of what we know.

308
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,280
Like, I think there are plenty of people

309
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,440
who throw away literally all the physics

310
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,840
and they go, well, I don't wanna be constrained

311
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,440
by the structures of physics.

312
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,800
And it really hurts their careers

313
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,160
because they can't,

314
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,200
they don't even understand basic physics

315
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,000
which stops them from being able to make meaningful progress.

316
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,960
Because if you can't,

317
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,620
if you can't explain what we already understand,

318
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,880
you can't extend the structure in new and interesting ways.

319
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,640
So with the example of multiple time directions,

320
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,520
like people do consider this like in,

321
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:10,320
you know, well-respected theoretical physics groups

322
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,160
for many different motivations,

323
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,720
either purely just as a tool to understand physics,

324
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,080
but in other cases, really,

325
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,400
because they're interested in like,

326
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,760
what would it mean and what are the implications?

327
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,240
But since we, like, all of our life experience

328
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,760
is still rooted in one time,

329
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,160
like I think it's still reasonable to say,

330
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,140
for sure, you have to recover that.

331
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,680
But at the same time, I don't think,

332
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:36,160
like, I think it's good to establish that like,

333
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,340
we have a language that works well

334
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:42,000
for describing a lot of the universe

335
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,280
and that we talk about how we break that,

336
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,120
those things in a controlled way.

337
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,560
So generalizations of say, like number of time dimensions

338
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,760
or say changes to the rules even,

339
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,480
so we're not even doing quantum mechanics,

340
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,800
like those things are really interesting directions,

341
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,120
but they're very constrained

342
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,080
because most of them don't even describe daily life

343
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,480
in any meaningful way.

344
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,080
Like most mutations in biology lead to things

345
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,920
getting far worse rather than better.

346
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,880
It's a rare mutation that works.

347
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,280
But what you've said is not actually true in science.

348
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,520
It's often the case that people make huge breakthroughs

349
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,720
because they don't understand the errors

350
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,080
of a previous generation.

351
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,440
So for example, you had the stray hydrogen atom

352
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,720
on the nucleotides that was in all the books

353
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,680
in the wrong place.

354
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,200
It happened that Watson and Crick were in an office

355
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:33,240
with Jerry Donahue who said, all the books are wrong.

356
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,000
And if you look in the double helix,

357
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,480
it's about a page and a half or something

358
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,320
before Jim Watson figures out the hydrogen bonds

359
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,280
that explain the Chargaff-Equimolar relations.

360
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,920
And you have similar things if you were,

361
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,840
in the 1940s, trying to study electromagnetism

362
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,360
and its effect on electrons,

363
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,640
you would almost certainly think

364
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,640
that was the electric and magnetic fields

365
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:59,280
that impacted an electron being passed around the solenoid.

366
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,320
And surprisingly enough, in the 50s,

367
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,600
we learned that there were classical consequences

368
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,600
of electromagnetism that we had really wrong

369
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,840
because we'd put all of our weight, if you will,

370
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,640
on the E and B fields of electromagnetism

371
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,120
and not on the electromagnetic four potential,

372
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,280
which in fact is something,

373
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,480
which is not a convenience product meant

374
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,440
to recover classical electromagnetism.

375
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:27,120
It in fact has weight, as was shown by Bohm and Aronov.

376
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,440
I mean, I don't disagree with that point of view.

377
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,400
I would just say that there's not,

378
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,160
I don't think there's a lack of contrarianism in the field.

379
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,960
And I don't think that that,

380
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,400
I don't think there's people feel

381
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,880
they're unable to take risks.

382
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,440
I think the problem is that like,

383
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,120
there's no, if you don't understand the starting point,

384
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,360
it's very difficult to take risks

385
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,880
that are in a productive way, right?

386
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,560
So if I don't understand why we think the world,

387
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,120
how the world works in this room,

388
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,600
it's very difficult to think,

389
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,960
well, what are the limitations

390
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,240
of how I break the structures that I understand?

391
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,560
So I would say, people understanding,

392
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:18,080
trying to propose generalizations

393
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,000
in all kinds of directions,

394
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,320
almost all of them are doomed to fail from the start.

395
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:25,000
And I think many people were like,

396
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,800
well, that's people trying to put unnecessary constraints

397
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,840
on me, I'm a free thinker.

398
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,400
It's like, no, that's not people trying to put it.

399
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,320
That's reality putting constraints on you.

400
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,360
And I think that's, we have to separate,

401
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,480
there's definitely sociological challenges

402
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,840
for young people to do really creative things,

403
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,280
but there's also just reality

404
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,240
that presents a real challenge to being super creative.

405
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,800
I just have a completely different impression

406
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,880
of your field from outside, which is people come to me

407
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,400
and they say, I can't afford to work

408
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,480
on what I really wanna work on.

409
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,920
I don't believe many of the things

410
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,080
that I'm being fed with my mother's milk.

411
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,160
I can understand them,

412
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,520
but every time I deviate more than a certain amount

413
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,640
or in a way that is not thought well of by the community,

414
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,920
all conversations die off.

415
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,480
I'm cautioned that this is an extremely brave thing to do

416
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,720
in the sense of bravery is stupidity.

417
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,040
And I think that what you're saying is a hope and a wish,

418
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,520
which in a few cases,

419
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,080
I don't wanna say that it's 100% across the board,

420
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,000
but I do believe that in part,

421
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,280
we don't have this freedom in this field

422
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,000
and we don't have the freedom to continue

423
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,840
to get engagement from the community

424
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,360
because in general,

425
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,960
we get these mega programs that are cropping up.

426
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,160
And in the mega programs,

427
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,560
there are all sorts of assumptions

428
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:43,000
that have been layered on, which are not proven.

429
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,520
And I would love to apply this rule

430
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,840
to some of the major mega programs and say,

431
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,840
hey, you're in the wrong number of dimensions,

432
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,160
you've got the wrong signature,

433
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,360
you've got the wrong symmetries,

434
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,680
you've got the wrong field content.

435
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:01,320
And it becomes this thing where the person then says,

436
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,440
oh, no, no, no, it's a toy theory.

437
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,240
I'm in a small Euclidean number of dimensions

438
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,680
with SU2 is the symmetries of the universe.

439
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,440
And I'm super symmetric.

440
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,200
I'm doing all of this stuff,

441
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,040
which is not the physical world that we live in

442
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,040
so far as we understand it.

443
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,920
And the idea is that that person is saying,

444
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:24,000
I wish to suspend the normal rules of science

445
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,520
because I'm doing toy stuff in order to learn

446
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,480
about the structures that are going to elucidate

447
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,320
the actual one physical universe that we're in.

448
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,880
Now, when you do that, I understand that.

449
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,920
But what we're talking about is something

450
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,520
like scientific immunity.

451
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,960
And if you've ever met somebody with diplomatic immunity,

452
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,520
some of them have the feeling that they can park

453
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,440
wherever they want to and they don't have to pay fines

454
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,800
and that they're not subject to the laws of the land

455
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,880
that they inhabit.

456
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,640
And what I'm trying to say is,

457
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,880
you cannot have these mega programs

458
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,560
casually imposing the strictest expectations

459
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,720
on its competitors and then giving itself

460
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,400
a permanent free pass to go on for decades

461
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,080
and decades about nothing.

462
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,760
Well, just to push back with loving respect.

463
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,480
Sorry, I have two actual physicists against one non-physicist.

464
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,320
I like my own.

465
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,560
I know, but you're an honorary physicist.

466
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,400
I'm sorry.

467
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,920
I'm sorry to tell you, you're an honorary physicist.

468
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,800
So, you're taking basically the opposite point

469
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,960
if I'm wrong, correct me,

470
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:26,560
but of this guy up here, not Weinstein, but Einstein,

471
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,680
who never thought any of his predictions

472
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,040
would be verifiable and yet they proved

473
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:35,320
to be very, very useful approximations, toy models.

474
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,320
Look at the Schwartzschild.

475
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,120
I mean, we already mentioned the Schwartzschild Singularity.

476
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,960
That was thought to be completely impractical,

477
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,240
never detectable.

478
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:47,360
Einstein subsequently also disavowed the detectability

479
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,680
of gravitational waves, gravitational lensing

480
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,600
and yet it was remarkably prescient

481
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,040
and that the toy model works in, you know,

482
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:57,640
basically 99.999% of all situations

483
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,280
where we could ever hope to apply it.

484
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,440
So, toy models are extremely powerful

485
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,600
and just to add on to that,

486
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,360
you and I were talking before Dan came in

487
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,120
about, you know, string theory in that very realm.

488
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,400
You know, sometimes it is useful to take a,

489
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,280
and again, I'm not speaking

490
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,440
as a simple experimental cosmologist, not a theorist,

491
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,440
but to take a toy model or take something

492
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,120
that we know works in certain situations

493
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,200
like the Klein-Gordon equation, which it doesn't apply,

494
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,880
unless I'm wrong to any real particles,

495
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,840
but it is useful to apply in a way

496
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,600
of generating other solutions.

497
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,080
Well, it sort of does with modifications.

498
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,040
With an idealized modification.

499
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,280
That's proving my point.

500
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,120
It's a toy model.

501
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,560
So what's wrong with toy models?

502
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,680
We get a lot of mileage.

503
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,840
Nothing is wrong with toy models.

504
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,600
You're saying that you're being excluded

505
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,840
or maybe not part of the physics program

506
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,840
unless you engage in something that...

507
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,360
I don't think that, this is just uncomfortable

508
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,320
because it's like, let me begin by saying,

509
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,320
string theory can't hurt anyone, right?

510
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,720
There's, string theory is a set of ideas.

511
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,000
It's a constellation of hypotheses

512
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,320
and it's a place to play.

513
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,440
There's nothing wrong with string theory

514
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,200
nor loop quantum gravity.

515
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,360
The problem is with, and I don't want to put it all

516
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,320
on string theories.

517
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,840
The problem is quantum gravity sociology,

518
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,480
which has blown a physics-shaped hole

519
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:18,280
in fundamental physics and replaced it

520
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,320
with a set of double standards

521
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,720
in which I want to know, what are the rules?

522
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,280
If the rules are, we all get to play,

523
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,000
then hot, hot diggity dog, let's all play.

524
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,920
And if the rules are, we should be very careful

525
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,320
that things agree with experiment

526
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,920
in any attempt to talk about something

527
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,920
as, that is violated, you know,

528
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,040
like as soon as Dirac finds that A times B

529
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,840
is not equal to B times A

530
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,040
when he tries to take the square root

531
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:47,320
of your Klein-Gordon equation, you know,

532
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,040
it's a short period of time before he says,

533
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,240
well, maybe A and B aren't numbers, they're matrices.

534
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,320
And then it's like, okay, so you did something

535
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:56,120
that was wrong, that didn't make any sense.

536
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,440
And then it did make sense later.

537
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:02,520
The problem that I have is that we have one set of players

538
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,840
that is functioning in some sense

539
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,680
as both the referees and a team.

540
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,360
So imagine that you're playing in the NFL

541
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,800
and you've got, the footlocker sends a team.

542
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,200
So all their employees are dressed

543
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,400
in vertical black and white stripes.

544
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,600
And they take the field, they're not particularly talented,

545
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,440
but the one thing that they have is-

546
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,840
It could be worse than on Sunday's supermodel final call.

547
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,680
What they do is that they start saying, you know,

548
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:30,640
off sides, why do you guys get to do this?

549
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,440
You're not, you're playing on the field,

550
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,160
you're not in a position to do that.

551
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,560
The problem is the cancerous sociology

552
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,280
of quantum field theory,

553
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:42,440
because this field is given excuses that the rest are not,

554
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:47,440
and it imposes the most strict attempts to impose

555
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,160
like scientific falsifiability.

556
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,400
And to tell people that you're out, you're out, you're out.

557
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,160
Well, 70 years later, after Bryce Dewitt

558
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:59,120
enters an anti-gravity competition with his famous essay,

559
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,320
we're still wrestling with a product that doesn't ship,

560
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,480
which is imposing standards on other fields.

561
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,360
And it's really important to blow that up in our lifetime

562
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,800
so that we can all move forward together.

563
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,160
So I actually celebrate what you're saying

564
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,640
about toy models.

565
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,920
I just wanna make sure that we don't have

566
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,120
scientific immunity for quantum gravity.

567
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,680
Well, I just wanna point out that Bryce Dewitt's book

568
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,180
on anti-gravity is so engaging

569
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:24,160
that you just can't put it down.

570
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:27,720
Dan, I wanna ask you, are we having a discussion

571
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,120
about sociology, or are we gonna talk about

572
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,040
the actual ideas behind these issues?

573
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,360
Because when you and I spoke, I said,

574
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,120
when you guys get to, I don't know what you guys do

575
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,120
over there in theory, but the bottom line,

576
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,400
someone's gotta keep an eye on you.

577
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,000
You know, we don't pick a person,

578
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,600
we don't pick a field when we wanna hire a young professor.

579
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,520
We want to hire you.

580
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,080
I was part, you know, the milieu,

581
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,400
I didn't actually, I wasn't on the committee,

582
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,520
but it was part of that milieu.

583
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,560
So I didn't say, oh, I really want someone who,

584
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,800
you know, has worked on string theory causes.

585
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:59,180
No, it's sort of a target of opportunity in some cases.

586
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:01,080
We were stealing you away from another university.

587
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,080
But the point is, is the sociology inside

588
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,880
the host organism, or is it something that is perceived

589
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,680
as being, afflicting it from outside, from an outside.

590
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,520
So I'm gonna agree with Eric in some ways,

591
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,960
and disagree in others, but let me, let me, let me,

592
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,800
let's start with more,

593
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,640
Must you agree?

594
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,600
I'll start where we agree, which is like,

595
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,700
so the problem when a field gets too big

596
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,880
is that it doesn't have to refer outside, right?

597
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,040
And that's, I think, what you're getting at,

598
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,640
which is like, we make our own rules,

599
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,520
we play by our own rules, and I never have to make contact

600
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,840
with, not just with nature, but the rest of the world, right?

601
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,960
I'm big enough, and you know, we can go to conferences

602
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,400
with a thousand people, and never talk to anyone

603
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,600
who's spoken a different language,

604
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,240
or thought about another problem.

605
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:47,400
So I think, I'm saying that because what I really see

606
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,800
is makes the difference most of the time

607
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,760
between the areas where the toy model makes progress,

608
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,160
where the people working on the toy model

609
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,880
really are meaningfully moving the field forward,

610
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,400
is their ability to both what they're working on

611
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,700
connects to other fields, but they're also able

612
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:06,060
to understand what other fields need from them,

613
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:08,140
and how their toy models are addressing that, right?

614
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:11,300
So for someone working on, let's say,

615
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,380
quantum field theory in two dimensions,

616
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:16,660
like, you could do it in such a way that's like,

617
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:19,140
why are these people wasting all their time?

618
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,500
But then there are other people that are going,

619
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,460
that were working on quantum field theory in two dimensions

620
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,620
who were like, condensed matter physicists,

621
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,780
and they were like, you know, no, we're working on this

622
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:29,100
because these are solvable models of phase transitions

623
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,380
that I can make in materia,

624
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:34,460
and it's the ability to communicate outside of your area

625
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:38,140
that's really important for the health of the health field,

626
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:42,380
and to keep those toy models coming in contact with nature,

627
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,220
right?

628
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,060
If you're not interacting with the people

629
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:47,660
for whom your toy model is supposed to be making contact,

630
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,500
then it really is useless, right?

631
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,900
If you're not, I mean, maybe it'll be useful eventually

632
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,740
someone 100 years later.

633
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,180
I don't think it's useless.

634
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:59,060
But well, but I do think it's valuable to both parties,

635
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:01,060
the people who are more in touch with nature

636
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,340
and the people who are just trying to make progress

637
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:06,260
to communicate with each other in a productive way.

638
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:08,540
And where I'll agree with you is that,

639
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,980
and I'm not just gonna say string theory,

640
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:12,140
I think many fields reach a point

641
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:14,140
that they're so self-sustaining

642
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:17,260
that nobody in that field feels the need

643
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,100
to talk outside of the field.

644
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,220
I'm happy not to say string theory once

645
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,060
for the rest of this.

646
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:23,980
I wanna talk about quantum gravity as the problem,

647
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,620
which subsumes string theory,

648
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,460
and it doesn't point the finger at string theory

649
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,300
in particular.

650
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,620
But I would say, like again,

651
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:32,900
and I would say it's true even in areas

652
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,180
that are experimentally driven.

653
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:37,380
Like this phenomena of a field becoming big enough

654
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:41,260
that it does not have to refer to nature

655
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,100
or progress or anything.

656
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,760
And it's just, as long as we're making everyone

657
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,760
in our community happy

658
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,640
and we're all speaking the same language,

659
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,620
then we're all doing fine.

660
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,700
Are you a miserating other community?

661
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,900
Am I?

662
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,620
No, no, in these large programs,

663
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,940
I'm even somewhat understanding

664
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:01,420
if you guys wanna take some portion of the resources

665
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:04,140
and go off into a cloistered monastery

666
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,180
and talk to each other for 40 years,

667
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:08,340
as long as it's not too much, that's fine.

668
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,080
It's when you start telling other people

669
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,900
that they're stupid,

670
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:12,940
and when you just to say that,

671
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,780
I don't know why anyone else works on anything else,

672
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:15,820
that's dumb.

673
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,940
And then you start talking about the fact

674
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:22,940
that you play up all of your competitor fields' problems.

675
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:26,220
You don't own your own.

676
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:29,740
What you're talking about is sort of a scientific pathology

677
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,380
and our discomfort,

678
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:34,220
our discomfort in dealing with this phenomenon

679
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:36,980
causes us to do proxy arguments.

680
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,940
One proxy argument is quantum gravity.

681
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,900
The problem with it is it doesn't make contact

682
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,260
with experiment.

683
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,580
Come on, right?

684
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,900
Or it doesn't fit the scientific method.

685
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,660
Oh, you're gonna repeat the big bang

686
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:49,940
and just say you have large and give me a break, right?

687
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:50,980
Another one is beauty.

688
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:53,780
Sabina is very focused on beauty.

689
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:57,060
Well, she's doing that in a way to avoid

690
00:28:57,060 --> 00:29:00,460
the head-on collision with what she's really trying to say.

691
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,820
I'm not trying to avoid the head-on collision.

692
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:05,860
What I'm trying to say is we cannot afford

693
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:09,540
for an imperial culture to be telling other cultures

694
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:12,020
that are trying to work on the same problems

695
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:15,380
that they cannot exist because you've got everything wrapped

696
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:18,780
up and literally we have a situation

697
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:23,740
in which your colleague, David E. Kaplan,

698
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:26,140
was recently featured in an interview

699
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,980
where he just let loose.

700
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:30,940
And I know David who did the film Particle Fever.

701
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,980
And what he was talking about was the feeling

702
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,700
that he was dumb and stupid and couldn't get something.

703
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,940
We used to have a game called Tag War in my neighborhood.

704
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:42,460
A new kid would come and we'd say, let's play Tag War.

705
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,820
And they would try to figure out the rules of Tag War.

706
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:47,300
More or less it was hazing and abuse.

707
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,260
And after about two and a half, three weeks

708
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,100
where we changed the rules over and over again

709
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,980
so that it find the person, I don't understand the rules.

710
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,100
It feels like there are no rules.

711
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,700
That's when they became part of the neighborhood

712
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,060
because it stood for the game without any rules.

713
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,740
That was what Tag War meant.

714
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:05,260
And my feeling about this is we have a Tag War problem

715
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:08,780
coming out of quantum gravity that is stalling the core field

716
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:11,340
that has to get addressed in the lifetime

717
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:14,580
of the people who are still there who created the problem

718
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,300
because good science requires that they go back

719
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,700
to their statements where there are a lot of people

720
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,780
who are no longer here.

721
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:23,060
People who began their careers in the 1980s.

722
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:26,500
How old were you during the anomaly cancellation, 1984?

723
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,340
Two years old.

724
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,580
There you go.

725
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,660
You have no idea what it was like.

726
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:33,660
And you can read about it, but the fact of the matter is

727
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:36,500
it was an absolutely brutal thing.

728
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,780
And Brian Greene and I had been having a back and forth

729
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:39,620
about this.

730
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,740
He got asked on Kurt Geimungal's program

731
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:44,180
about what are these issues that people keep talking about?

732
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,460
And he said, oh, well, we were very enthusiastic.

733
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,900
And I heard you say this thing about particle theorists

734
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,140
are like bosons.

735
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:53,060
They all line up and sort of find the same things interesting.

736
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:53,820
No.

737
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:56,980
North Koreans line up and find the same things interesting.

738
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:00,580
Iraqis under Saddam Hussein all voted the same way.

739
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:03,540
You have a problem which is why they're behaving like bosons

740
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,660
rather than fermions.

741
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:07,860
And why the fermions are being, evolutionary theory

742
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:10,500
has a concept called interference competition,

743
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,780
where if you have one animal that tries to keep another animal

744
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:16,340
from being able to get to the salt lick or the water

745
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:19,220
or the food, and then other animal that's being kept from that

746
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,100
dies off.

747
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,380
And that's how we've lost these people.

748
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,780
There are so many theories and interesting people

749
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:28,020
who are no longer with us because of this mad grab

750
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:31,020
for resources quoting something like white man's burden.

751
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,820
Manifest destinies.

752
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:36,380
It is our manifest destiny to change the problem.

753
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:38,700
We used to have a concept called unified field theory

754
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,060
or unification.

755
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:40,740
That went away.

756
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:43,780
And it got supplanted by something called quantum gravity.

757
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,540
And that became the thing that got rolled out

758
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,620
through Dennis Overby in the New York Times, repeated

759
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:51,340
in Science Magazine ad nauseam, until everyone

760
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:54,740
was brainwashed thinking, the problem of our time

761
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,220
is quantum gravity.

762
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:59,140
And it's not.

763
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:01,820
I mean, are you saying we need literal tribunals

764
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:04,500
to get Edward Whitton and Pulchinsk?

765
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,900
Well, we can't get Pulchinsk anymore.

766
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,060
But what is it?

767
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,100
What's really bothering you?

768
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:12,260
I understand that these are challenges.

769
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,980
It's frustrating to have a field that's

770
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:17,420
had, from one perspective, a lack of progress,

771
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,380
but entrenched because of the prestige

772
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,940
of the previous practitioners.

773
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,860
But again, I'd like to point this out.

774
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:25,100
In 1859, there was a very bright guy

775
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,780
by the name of James Clerk Maxwell, who worked very hard

776
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:30,340
and had a successful model of electromagnetic wave

777
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:32,900
propagation that, in the sense that it predicted

778
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,220
experimental observables.

779
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:36,580
But it was based on whirlpools and eddies

780
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:39,180
and all sorts of other things to substantiate

781
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,260
an ether-like material.

782
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,460
So he was right for the wrong reasons

783
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,460
or wrong for the right reason, Galileo, same thing.

784
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:48,020
He thought the tides were caused by the Earth's rotation.

785
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,220
They're really caused by the moon.

786
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:52,380
So in other words, why is it so important that we punish

787
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:52,860
Edward Whitton?

788
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:53,740
I mean, I would like to be.

789
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,700
It's not a question of punishment.

790
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,300
Maybe Edward Whitton has something

791
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,220
to say about this behavior.

792
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:01,180
And I would love to hear, Cumran and Brian Green

793
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:08,020
and Lenny Susskin, as well as Natty Cyberg and Eva Silverstein.

794
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:12,420
It would be great to have these people in a dialogue.

795
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,740
Natty Cyberg said something.

796
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,860
He said, string theorists are very arrogant.

797
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,340
If somebody comes up with something

798
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,980
that makes progress that isn't string theory,

799
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:21,140
we'll just say it's string theory.

800
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:25,220
And I'm like, no.

801
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,540
There's a concept called mustn't.

802
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,580
You don't get to do that stuff.

803
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:32,420
You're in the wrong field, if that's how you feel.

804
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:34,860
And I know, Natty, we have a cordial relationship.

805
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,980
You don't get to play that way.

806
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,900
You don't get to call people stupid unless you're

807
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:45,140
going to back it up, or it can come back at you.

808
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:47,780
I mean, I would be happy to talk to Lenny Susskin

809
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,420
and talk to him about all the people he's

810
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:52,100
insulted over the years, because he's so very open about it.

811
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,580
He's not hiding it.

812
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,340
Just say, you're an old man.

813
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,780
You're at the end of your career.

814
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,340
How to go?

815
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,500
What happened?

816
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,860
Did you make the progress that your friend Feynman made,

817
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:04,420
or Murray Gelman, or any of the people

818
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:06,180
that you knew from a previous era?

819
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,940
Am I feeling about this?

820
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:08,420
Pardon me?

821
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,820
That's a very high standard.

822
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:13,300
Let's talk about the A team, the Institute for Advanced Study.

823
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:16,260
At some point recently, had Robert Dycraft, a string

824
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:20,620
theorist as its director, Natty Cyberg, a string theorist,

825
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:24,380
Edward Whitten, Juan Maldesena, and then

826
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:28,420
Nima was sort of off a little bit in necessarily

827
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,860
quantum gravity.

828
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:35,780
That's an enormous investment in quantum gravity.

829
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,900
And the problem that I'm having with this

830
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:43,020
is Dan Friedan, a prominent quantum gravity researcher,

831
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:45,540
talked about this openly, said science only

832
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:48,660
works when we actually go back and look

833
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:52,740
at how we've behaved and confront our own failures.

834
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:54,980
This is the same thing with the bootstrap method.

835
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,500
I feel like what we're doing is we're

836
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,740
living the Jeffrey Chu nightmare all over again.

837
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,340
Do you feel like that's the challenge

838
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,780
that we're facing in the theoretical?

839
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:04,820
Well, I'd first like to just, I think

840
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:07,660
we can agree that there can be sociology problems.

841
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:10,740
But I would also say, as a young person,

842
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:14,500
I find the same level of saying that there's

843
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,620
been no progress in physics.

844
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:19,980
It's insulting to young people who are not part of this,

845
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,820
who feel like we're making real progress,

846
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:25,060
who see real progress happening, and to say,

847
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:27,420
but at the same time, if you're going back

848
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:31,460
to a much older generation, and you're saying,

849
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:33,260
and we're painting everyone who's come back

850
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:36,540
in the past 40 years as being complicit with this,

851
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,180
and we can't think for ourselves,

852
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,540
and we're being influenced by it,

853
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:42,380
and it doesn't make it easier for us to go off,

854
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:45,100
to just say we've made no progress.

855
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,100
Doesn't help it easier.

856
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,220
But that's a total mischaracter.

857
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:51,520
I mean, I've never said anything so simplistic

858
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,600
in my life.

859
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,880
What I've said is, when you try to say

860
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,880
that you're going to quantize gravity,

861
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,600
what you're talking about is quantizing geometry.

862
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,920
And what happened was the most romantic backfire possible

863
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,840
in the sciences is that you instead geometrized

864
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,880
the quantum, and the great legacy of these people

865
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,040
is that they figured out that quantum field theory

866
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,600
really has nothing to do with physics.

867
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,280
Physics, as we understand it, the physical world

868
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:19,080
is one input to the quantum field theory machine.

869
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:22,000
Quantum field theory is really about waves on waves.

870
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,760
And that happens in cowardism theorem

871
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,160
and algebraic topology.

872
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,440
It happens in conformal theory that has nothing to do

873
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:32,280
with the physical dimensions and realms.

874
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,480
What we found out was fascinating

875
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,120
because in fact, it backfired.

876
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,200
And there's nobody who would like to celebrate

877
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:43,200
all the good that Digraph and Natty and Ed and Company did

878
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:47,640
in this story, including the celebration of the toy models.

879
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:52,480
The problem that I'm having is that they reordered the field.

880
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,880
I mean, this is a book that I keep very close to me

881
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,080
because it's a conference that happened

882
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:04,320
at the exact moment before the anomaly cancellation.

883
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,880
And Murray Gelman gave a keynote address

884
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,800
at Shelter Island 2, the conference that was supposed

885
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,920
to recapitulate the 1947 conference

886
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,840
that got physics back on track.

887
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,480
So they're trying to get back the magic.

888
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,760
He says, as usual, solving the problems of one era

889
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,160
has shown up the critical questions of the next.

890
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,640
The very first ones that come to mind

891
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,080
looking at the standard theory of today.

892
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,080
He's talking about the standard model.

893
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,440
Why this particular structure for the families

894
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,840
and particular why flavor chiral

895
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,080
with left and right-handed particles

896
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,000
being treated differently?

897
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,960
Why three families?

898
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,080
That's a generalization of Robbie's famous question.

899
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:41,840
How many sets of Higgs bosons are there in the standard theory?

900
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,360
And why SU3 cross SU2 cross U1?

901
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,720
Why those symmetries?

902
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:50,480
Now, in all of those cases, those are classical questions.

903
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,560
And what you see and the reason that it's important

904
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,840
that your generation know its history

905
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:58,560
is that one of the things that happens in marketing

906
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:02,600
is that you have a product and you have to create a problem

907
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,680
so that your product fills that hole, right?

908
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,040
And this is what happens with the 76 trombones

909
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,560
in the Music Man, right?

910
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:13,840
You've got a problem in its pool and the solution is music.

911
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:18,440
And okay, what these people did to the field

912
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,360
was that they reordered our concept

913
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,760
of what our principal problems were

914
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,400
around the problems that they thought

915
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,800
they were most likely to solve.

916
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,320
And I don't need them to be in pain.

917
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,360
I don't want to see particularly vindictive.

918
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:36,000
But what I do want to see is tell me about all the people

919
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,640
whose careers were terminated during this.

920
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,560
Tell me what they were working on.

921
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,600
Should we have them back?

922
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,800
Should we have conferences devoted

923
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:47,440
to what if quantum gravity doesn't exist?

924
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,640
Shall we actually ask,

925
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,880
because what you talked about with heterodoxy

926
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,200
is that you're usually talking about orthodoxy plus epsilon.

927
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,600
I'm gonna go out in the limb and say sterile neutrino.

928
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,800
Well, that's not really very heterodox.

929
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,960
And then maybe you go a little bit,

930
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,640
I'm gonna say that there are multiple axions

931
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,240
to solve the strong CP problem

932
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,800
plus create cosmic birefring.

933
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,480
Whatever these things are,

934
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:13,080
they're not really what we're talking about

935
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,560
in terms of heterodoxy.

936
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:19,400
And it's very important to either impose these rules

937
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,720
on this group of people

938
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,440
or to relax the rules for other people

939
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,840
so that we can have truly different ideas

940
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:27,280
because I think that we will probably find

941
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,680
that over the last 50 years,

942
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,760
there were many ideas that will fall into the final theory

943
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,120
that were pushed aside into the dustbin by this group.

944
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,720
I mean, again, I wanna take it back

945
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:40,080
what I think is certainly not to invalidate

946
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,080
anything you've said, Eric,

947
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:44,800
but I think that that might be parochial to the extent

948
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,560
that it may involve certain members of the community

949
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:50,360
who aren't affiliated with these three-letter organizations

950
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:54,960
like IAS or MIT or whatever, NSA.

951
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,880
But I think what's more interesting,

952
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,200
and Dan is free to apply in any way he likes

953
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,120
and respond to you,

954
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:03,360
but the point I think is how many flowers

955
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,560
should be blooming right now?

956
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,440
I mean, you mentioned a couple of different alternatives,

957
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,160
a loop on gravity and other things.

958
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,120
At what point would you have to say

959
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,800
the portfolio should be fully diversified

960
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,480
and that we should actually devote

961
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,600
equal amounts of attention?

962
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,600
Oh, nobody's saying that, Brian.

963
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,160
Right, but now you're saying,

964
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,720
well, we should hold these people to account.

965
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,240
Well, first of all, correct me if I'm wrong,

966
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,000
but I don't think Edward Whitton's published something

967
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,520
on string theory in a decade.

968
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,040
I mean, the last thing I saw is that he wants us

969
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,320
to go visit a black hole

970
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,120
to see if there's a one microsecond time delay

971
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:38,440
at the end edge of 5AU or something like that.

972
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:41,200
I don't know to what extent he's still holding sway

973
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,960
over the field that you're in.

974
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,680
Eva is actually much, much younger.

975
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,720
What did Coomron say?

976
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,080
What did Coomron say?

977
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,040
He was on the podcast two years ago

978
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,200
and I confronted him as all podcasts are legal,

979
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,400
podcasters are legally obligated to do.

980
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,960
And I said, what about this claim

981
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,880
that there's been no experimentally falsifiable things

982
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,800
predicted by string theory?

983
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,880
He said, oh, no, no, you're wrong.

984
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,840
And you couldn't go back and see this episode.

985
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,400
But didn't you ask about what he wanted on his tombstone?

986
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,840
Oh, what he wanted on his tombstone?

987
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:12,080
Yeah, that and Michio Kaku, very similar answers.

988
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,560
The equations of string theory, right?

989
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:17,160
So, but let me just, one thing that he did say is,

990
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,080
well, no, it's not true.

991
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,200
String theory does predict the mass of the electron

992
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:23,640
shall be between 10 to the minus 35 plank masses

993
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,660
and 10 to the minus one plank masses.

994
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:26,760
And yeah, that sounds all funny.

995
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,880
We can laugh about it.

996
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:32,200
You know, in logarithmic space, it's not terrible.

997
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,520
I guess the point being, to what extent

998
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,000
we're something like loop quantum gravity,

999
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,600
which many people, including my friend Carla Revelli

1000
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,680
has been on the podcast many times,

1001
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,280
he has said that, yeah, there are challenges.

1002
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,280
There are experimental falsifications

1003
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,640
of some of the claims of loop quantum gravity,

1004
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,560
in particular for propagation of velocity

1005
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:52,600
versus electromagnetic frequency of distant quasars.

1006
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,680
But the point I guess I'm trying to make is,

1007
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:58,000
if you are the director of the IAS, you clean house,

1008
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,000
is it really, I mean, would string theory have,

1009
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,400
just yes or no, simply yes or no,

1010
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,640
would string theory have a place

1011
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,160
and then would loop quantum gravity have a place

1012
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,040
and then would geometric unity have the primary position?

1013
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,360
I don't think we need to worry about permanent positions.

1014
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,840
I think that the key issue, I mean,

1015
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,040
let me just say some things people won't associate with me.

1016
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,680
In general, string theorist,

1017
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,680
part of the quantum graph, I have to use string theory there

1018
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:26,680
because they're smarter and that's uncomfortable.

1019
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,880
But they're really, really smart

1020
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,480
and they're really, really good at quantum field theory.

1021
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,800
And I see that and I'm happy about that.

1022
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:39,520
What's more, many of them are really good at geometry.

1023
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,680
And it's incredibly impressive.

1024
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,560
And I think that it does wonderful things for the field

1025
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,960
to have progress going on in the gym on the treadmill

1026
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:50,000
when you're not actually running a marathon.

1027
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,960
So in a certain sense, in that particular sub-community,

1028
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,280
people are in extremely good shape.

1029
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,920
The generals have been playing war games for 50 years

1030
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,960
because there were no war games to fight.

1031
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,040
They have a distorted sense of what being a general

1032
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,560
actually is because they haven't seen action.

1033
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:09,560
But I would never want these people driven out of the field.

1034
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,920
I don't know anyone I praise as much as Edward Whitten

1035
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:15,760
for his contributions principally to geometry

1036
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,640
and to the structure of quantum field theory,

1037
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:18,880
although not the quantum field theory

1038
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,480
that we seem to live with it.

1039
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,320
So I don't think that that's really the argument

1040
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,160
that I'm making.

1041
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,720
And I think that part of the problem is that

1042
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:28,120
this is a very clickbait thing about, you know,

1043
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:30,680
string theory is BS versus no string theory,

1044
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,680
the power and the glory of string theory.

1045
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,880
It's of no interest to anyone.

1046
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,600
What you said about loop quantum gravity

1047
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:37,440
that was interesting.

1048
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,720
I asked Lee Smolen about this, who's a friend.

1049
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:41,880
He says, yeah, the original hope

1050
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,720
for loop quantum gravity is not realized

1051
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,920
without other ideas, this does not work.

1052
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:46,760
It doesn't carry the day

1053
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:49,000
and it doesn't behave as expected.

1054
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,480
Now say what you want about Lee Smolen,

1055
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,840
and I'll be honest, a lot of people

1056
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,920
in that other community in quantum gravity

1057
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,240
say incredibly negative things about Lee Smolen,

1058
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,680
but he behaved properly.

1059
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,400
There's no need for a tribunal

1060
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:06,600
when a leader of the field says, you know what?

1061
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:10,480
We were exuberant and they were exuberant.

1062
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,480
We were optimistic, they were optimistic,

1063
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:16,160
but they didn't go about with this manifest destiny nonsense

1064
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,800
and they can reflect and say, you know what?

1065
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,680
It doesn't work the way we thought

1066
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:23,360
or we can't get fermions into the theory comfortably

1067
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,560
or something like that.

1068
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,640
And I really think that we have to understand the difference

1069
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,400
that the ethics of loop quantum gravity

1070
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:33,720
are much better than the ethics in its competitor.

1071
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:38,760
Well, I think where I push back is just,

1072
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:41,040
I think you're often identifying

1073
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,480
understanding quantum field theory

1074
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,280
with doing quantum gravity research.

1075
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:49,080
For me, I would say the young people,

1076
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:51,840
so you want the older veterans of the field

1077
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:54,000
to say they were wrong, and that may never happen.

1078
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:54,840
No, no, no, no, maybe they're not wrong.

1079
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:55,680
I think if you talk-

1080
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,000
I want them to face the issue.

1081
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,760
But I think if you talk to the,

1082
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:00,920
I think the response you're talking about,

1083
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,240
which is like, do people see the challenges?

1084
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:06,320
I think what a lot of younger people would say

1085
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,640
the lessons that have been learned from string theory

1086
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,760
is that we didn't understand quantum field theory well enough

1087
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,120
to be ready to jump.

1088
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:15,800
We've learned so many lessons about just quantum field theory

1089
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,920
that we were kind of out over our skis thinking,

1090
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,160
oh, we've got this quantum field theory thing solved.

1091
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,040
We should be jumping to quantum gravity.

1092
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:24,200
And we've learned so much about quantum field theory.

1093
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:27,520
And quantum field theory is certainly relevant to,

1094
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,280
data and real life and cosmology.

1095
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,000
And as a matter of it, it covers everything.

1096
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,200
It's the, to steal a headline from an article

1097
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:39,520
on the CERN Courier, it's like the theory of theories, right?

1098
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,520
It organizes not just like one theory,

1099
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:45,360
but sort of how all theories fit together.

1100
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:46,600
So what is the theory of theory?

1101
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,840
So this was used as a title to an article

1102
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,640
about effective field theory.

1103
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,080
But it was just understood that a lot of what we've been

1104
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:56,320
learning is, what is the space of theories

1105
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,360
that are self consistent?

1106
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:59,120
Like what are the rules?

1107
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:01,360
And part of the, why was,

1108
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:03,320
like one of the things we got out of string theory,

1109
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:06,960
what like the string community was ADFCFT.

1110
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,560
And what that told us is a lot of things

1111
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,040
that we had been thinking were,

1112
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,560
people had been thinking were problems

1113
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,120
that were going to be solved by the string

1114
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:15,520
were really phenomena that was living

1115
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,160
in an everyday quantum field theory

1116
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,080
that we hadn't fully understood.

1117
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,440
And I would say my generation probably more,

1118
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,040
like a lot of people who I think you might look at

1119
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:25,680
and say, you know, based on their training,

1120
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,440
like who their PhD advisors were,

1121
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,520
you might say, well, that's a string theorist.

1122
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,360
And I would say, I don't think they ever do string theory.

1123
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:33,200
Like they do quantum field theory

1124
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,520
and they know quantum field theory is relevant.

1125
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:35,360
They've moved to that.

1126
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:36,920
But I think some never did it.

1127
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,960
Like literally at no point in their graduate career

1128
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,240
at any point they have a, like so myself,

1129
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:42,840
I did string theory when I was younger.

1130
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,720
I would not characterize myself as a string theorist

1131
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,520
or someone who ever uses string theory.

1132
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:50,120
Nobody told me I had to do string theory.

1133
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:51,720
You have characterized yourself as somebody

1134
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:53,280
who finds it useful in what you do.

1135
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,040
And so you are using string theory.

1136
00:46:55,040 --> 00:47:00,040
Because I learned, because the phrase what was useful

1137
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:03,960
is that string theory was always characterized as,

1138
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:05,000
you know, what is it?

1139
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,960
What's the problem of quantum gravity we're trying to solve?

1140
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,320
We're trying to solve problems about the fact

1141
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,480
that the thing doesn't make sense at short distances.

1142
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,120
And of course, all these things are supposed to make sense

1143
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:13,960
at long distances

1144
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,720
because they're good effective field theories.

1145
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:17,240
We don't like, unless we're doing

1146
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:18,880
all four short distance physics,

1147
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,800
it has, you know, everything should just make sense

1148
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,040
in some reasonable way.

1149
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,480
And, but I learned what I was learning

1150
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:26,320
about loop quantum gravity.

1151
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:27,640
That's nowhere in sight, right?

1152
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:31,160
Because there's so many lessons I didn't learn

1153
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:33,000
that were just basic lessons about, you know,

1154
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,160
how should theories be organized

1155
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:37,800
that were never in the loop quantum gravity playbook,

1156
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,040
at least when I was learning it.

1157
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:41,880
And so, yeah, what I learned doing string theory was like,

1158
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:43,320
I really learned effective field theory.

1159
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:45,280
I learned, when is there a problem

1160
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,880
that I actually have to worry about string theory too?

1161
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:51,560
And what I mostly learned is that this is very small.

1162
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:52,400
No, of course.

1163
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,800
And you can do a lot of really, really exciting

1164
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:56,400
and cool stuff that's, I would call fundamental

1165
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:57,560
without ever talking about quantum gravity.

1166
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:58,880
I've looked at your career

1167
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,840
and to the best of my understanding,

1168
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:03,840
your career is at the school with three basic legs.

1169
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,000
One of which is cosmology,

1170
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,440
where you're gonna get data from all the great new instruments

1171
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,520
that we're putting towards the heavens.

1172
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,400
Second thing is effective theory,

1173
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:16,320
so that you're going to reduce everything to something

1174
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:18,920
which, you know, at some particular scale

1175
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:21,680
is very cleanly defined and you can work with it.

1176
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,840
And then the other thing is some amount of particle theory

1177
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:29,400
where you're gonna hope to use the cosmological

1178
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,920
through the effective theory to elucidate the nature

1179
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:34,800
of the fundamental fields as waves and collision.

1180
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:38,240
So that's, I see your particular gambit.

1181
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,880
And I'm 100% supportive of it.

1182
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:42,760
You did refer to yourself as a young person.

1183
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,360
You're over 40 if I'm not mistaken.

1184
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:45,200
Unfortunately, yes.

1185
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,320
Okay, so you're not a young person.

1186
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:48,720
I think I just crossed the threshold

1187
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,200
by academic standards.

1188
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,200
No, no, no, but you know,

1189
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,280
Derock's old thing about a physicist

1190
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:57,640
the past 30th year, this is elongated in part

1191
00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:00,360
because of the fact that we deviated

1192
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:01,680
from scientific norms.

1193
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:05,120
We don't have 25 year olds and 30 year olds

1194
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:07,920
who are running the field the way I think of as normal.

1195
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,200
I think there are way too many people in the field

1196
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,040
to be honest when you're asking what would you do?

1197
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:13,800
And I feel that of those people,

1198
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:18,320
they're not properly arrayed across first.

1199
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:20,320
Well, they're not fermionic.

1200
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:22,480
There are plenty of people who like

1201
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:26,880
Brian Greenfield's no need to query Peter Wojt

1202
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,520
who's putting forward a twister theory

1203
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:32,400
based on the group SU4 and its inclusion of SU3 cross U1

1204
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:36,520
as a subgroup in twister space

1205
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:39,720
with a WIC continuation to SU2 cross SU2

1206
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,600
where one of the two halves gives the weak force

1207
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:44,480
and therefore it gives you an idea of the asymmetry.

1208
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,520
You have to read your colleague's stuff

1209
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:51,200
whether you like it or not to be a good colleague.

1210
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,000
You don't have to read all of it,

1211
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,280
but when you can't put in 45 minutes

1212
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,960
and there was a piece of French

1213
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:00,560
that was between 45 and minutes, I didn't say on air

1214
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,040
and you say, I'm too busy

1215
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:05,160
and then we catch you playing ping pong in the lounge

1216
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:06,960
or you're going to drinking

1217
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,920
or you're writing a blog about nothing in particular,

1218
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,920
it's completely disingenuous.

1219
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:14,960
Now, another example of this is Garrett Leasey.

1220
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,920
Garrett Leasey is a snickering.

1221
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,720
Garrett Leasey, you mean that thing

1222
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:20,960
that dislodged this man?

1223
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,400
Okay.

1224
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,080
No, it doesn't work.

1225
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:25,480
I don't think it works.

1226
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:28,560
It's got tons of interesting good ideas in it.

1227
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:33,560
And this condescension against individual research programs

1228
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,120
where somebody has a really interesting idea

1229
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:39,720
and I think both Peter White and Garrett are wrong

1230
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:41,360
and it's not going to work,

1231
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:43,800
but I'll be goddamn if I'm going to stand back and say,

1232
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,960
because I think I can see why it's not going to work,

1233
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:48,200
I'm going to pretend that you have no ideas

1234
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:51,480
and I'm going to slag you behind your back as a colleague

1235
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:55,240
and I'm going to dunk and drag on Twitter.

1236
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:57,200
This is toxic behavior.

1237
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,400
And so what I think is,

1238
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:01,840
is that we have very few idiosyncratic programs

1239
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:03,720
that are able to even share a stage.

1240
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:07,160
There's no point of contact where,

1241
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,840
I have an unusual bookmark in this book.

1242
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,080
It's a dollar.

1243
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:15,960
Yeah, it's a dollar.

1244
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:18,720
This is a dollar signed by Sheldon Glashow

1245
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:23,560
where I won it in a 20 minute discussion in his office

1246
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:26,520
and it took him 27 years to,

1247
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:31,520
27, I'm going to turn into an NFT and make bajillions.

1248
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:34,960
It took him 27 years to acknowledge

1249
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:39,520
that he'd lost the bet on whether G2 contained SU3.

1250
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,120
I have no idea why that took 27 years.

1251
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:44,720
I like Shelley, we have a good relationship,

1252
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:48,240
but the fact is you can't have people saying,

1253
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,120
oh, I'm late to pick up my kids,

1254
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:53,080
that I have to go out to dinner or whatever

1255
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:55,640
and never actually make eye contact

1256
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:58,320
with the fact that they're not giving real answers.

1257
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:01,520
And by the way, I would love to actually talk physics

1258
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,360
rather than about physics,

1259
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:06,000
but what I'm trying to say is that our meta problem

1260
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,040
is that with all the money floating around,

1261
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:09,960
nobody holds a conference saying,

1262
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:13,080
the last 40 years, WTF,

1263
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,440
with a bunch of different theories,

1264
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,960
like does anybody else have an idea?

1265
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:19,840
And I can assure you, I can go

1266
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:24,520
on very large platforms and talk about very concrete ideas.

1267
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:26,160
I can try to tell you why I believe

1268
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,720
that there are three generations of matter,

1269
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:30,400
why it's chiral, et cetera, et cetera.

1270
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:33,680
And I promise you that the very weird behavior

1271
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:36,160
is that people don't take it seriously

1272
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,640
because what they're really trying to do

1273
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:39,200
is not ask questions.

1274
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:40,280
They're really trying to say,

1275
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,960
how do I make this problem go away

1276
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:44,400
so I can get back to the cargo cult science

1277
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:47,160
that I've made a career around inside of a large community?

1278
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:48,520
That's what's dangerous.

1279
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:50,360
See, I don't agree with that.

1280
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:52,800
I mean, I would say that a lot of people

1281
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,280
aren't gonna engage with,

1282
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:57,480
I mean, the idea that what we need to do

1283
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:59,480
is find the right way to unify the forces,

1284
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:02,920
I think is just, as you said, it's been unproductive.

1285
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:06,200
And a lot of people don't mind that that's how they're,

1286
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:09,320
like, you know, there are weird hints from nature, right?

1287
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:11,880
Like cosmological constant is a weird hint from nature.

1288
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:13,720
And like, we'd like to, we'd like that.

1289
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:15,720
Is it unification or that unification wouldn't work?

1290
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:18,160
But Daniel, if I ask you,

1291
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,240
what is your best guess as to why there appear

1292
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,200
to be three generations of matter?

1293
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,160
Would you say you have a guess?

1294
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:27,000
No, I wouldn't, I mean, I would say there are many people

1295
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,320
who have worked hard on coming up with models.

1296
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:31,640
I'll see, many seem plausible.

1297
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:36,120
Like, it could be, like, I have no particular opinion.

1298
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:38,760
And I don't think that we're gonna find the answer.

1299
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,440
So if somebody came up to me

1300
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:43,880
who could pass sort of a basic competency test

1301
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:45,040
and said, I think I know why

1302
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:47,220
there are three generations of matter.

1303
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:48,480
I would find that fascinating.

1304
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,320
Brian and I were on the phone,

1305
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:52,360
we were talking about this issue.

1306
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:54,120
And Brian said, well, what if I were to tell you

1307
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:57,200
of something so exciting that it has seven sigma this,

1308
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:00,920
that which is to me, would you race down to San Diego?

1309
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:01,760
I said, sure.

1310
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:07,600
And I think he wasn't prepared for that answer.

1311
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:10,460
There is something about the excitement

1312
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:13,760
of believing things, trying things

1313
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:17,640
and caring about what your colleagues believe.

1314
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:20,800
Do you have any high conviction beliefs

1315
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,060
about the extension of the standard model?

1316
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:26,480
So I do have my high conviction belief

1317
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,920
is that anything that extends the standard model

1318
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:33,920
will look like something that's effective field theory

1319
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:35,080
at low energies.

1320
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:38,520
So if I'm going to look for hints, experimental hints

1321
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:41,960
that are gonna tell me which way the world actually works,

1322
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:43,640
my strategy is gonna be,

1323
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:45,680
write down everything I could imagine

1324
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,240
that would look like a change

1325
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:48,720
to the effective theory of the standard model

1326
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:49,960
and go look for that.

1327
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:53,320
And that is what most experimental programs are looking for.

1328
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:54,520
But that avoids the question.

1329
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:58,200
Do you personally have any high conviction beliefs

1330
00:54:58,200 --> 00:54:59,640
and I'll extend it?

1331
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:02,400
Do you think we have anything wrong in the standard model,

1332
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,800
not just in terms of the Lagrangian and its consequences,

1333
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:07,860
but in terms of how we talk about it?

1334
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:10,000
And do you have any high conviction beliefs

1335
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,840
for what extends it and what is likely to be true?

1336
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:15,540
That are really things like this, I believe,

1337
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:16,960
can you say the phrase this, I believe.

1338
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:20,180
I believe that the universe is Lorenz invariant

1339
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:21,180
at short distances,

1340
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:24,500
that whatever unifies the standard model

1341
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:26,380
is not breaking Lorenz invariance.

1342
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:29,380
That if you observed,

1343
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:31,220
if we were to observe something cosmologically

1344
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:33,500
or laboratory, that would break your conviction

1345
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:36,620
or it would cause you to reveal excitingly new research.

1346
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:38,740
You believe in relativity.

1347
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:39,580
Yes, absolutely.

1348
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:40,980
That is not very bold.

1349
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:43,660
Okay, but by the way,

1350
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:46,180
most things that are being proposed as extensions

1351
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:48,820
to the standard model by definition are,

1352
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:49,900
well, they might be wrong.

1353
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:50,740
Most of them are wrong.

1354
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:51,580
How do you know, Eric?

1355
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:52,420
We haven't looked for action.

1356
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:54,340
Well, because they can't all be correct.

1357
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:55,780
They're not all compatible.

1358
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:56,780
Some of them are mutually exclusive.

1359
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:58,580
All I'm saying is this is to say

1360
00:55:58,580 --> 00:56:01,860
that the universe is manifestly Lorenz invariant

1361
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:04,660
is an interesting claim that could be falsified.

1362
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:07,260
And by falsification, I think that would excite you.

1363
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:08,260
That wouldn't depress you.

1364
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:09,380
That wouldn't ruin your day.

1365
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:11,500
It would totally change how I think about it.

1366
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:13,140
I love your puppy point.

1367
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:14,180
Puppies are adorable.

1368
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:15,540
Ice cream is delicious.

1369
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:17,220
I understand.

1370
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:19,180
Mom and apple pie are good things.

1371
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:21,500
But there are, I mean, I think that's a case

1372
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:24,380
where people have legitimately proposed ideas

1373
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:27,060
that break learns and they're interesting ideas.

1374
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:31,220
So, someone who had an idea that broke this principle

1375
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:33,260
that was within the kind of traditional community

1376
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:36,420
but really broke away from it was Peter Harava

1377
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:40,380
with his non Lorenz invariant solutions to gravity,

1378
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:42,060
his proposal.

1379
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:44,620
And again, like, it was an interesting idea.

1380
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:45,620
I didn't look at that and go,

1381
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:46,780
I understood what he's doing.

1382
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:47,620
We read those papers.

1383
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:48,460
Everyone's like, that's interesting idea.

1384
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:49,620
So you read the paper, you like.

1385
00:56:49,620 --> 00:56:51,460
But I also don't think it's the way the world works.

1386
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:52,500
And I also.

1387
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:53,660
That's not what I'm talking about.

1388
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:55,060
Like if Zhao came out with something,

1389
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:57,340
maybe you look at it and then you say,

1390
00:56:57,340 --> 00:56:58,420
okay, that's pretty wild.

1391
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:00,180
I don't buy it, but I understand what he's doing.

1392
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:02,500
But I think, again, the difference between Peter

1393
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:04,900
who was definitely deviating away from the community

1394
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:06,060
was not that they're like,

1395
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:07,660
he's a card-carrying member of the community.

1396
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:10,340
Is that he was able to communicate his idea

1397
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:12,420
in a way that made sense to everyone.

1398
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:15,140
And, but that, but I guess what I would say is like,

1399
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:17,100
you're asking me to take a definitive position

1400
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,460
about a theory we could never test.

1401
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:20,340
No, no, no, I'm saying you're a theoretical physicist.

1402
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:21,180
Yeah, absolutely.

1403
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:22,900
You are, you know, and to be fair to you,

1404
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:25,380
cause I'm not, there's no gotcha or a zinger here.

1405
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:27,860
I see you as mostly a cosmologist

1406
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:30,100
who is keeping the door open to particle theory

1407
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:32,820
through the conduit of effective theory, right?

1408
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:34,140
And that may not be fair

1409
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:35,780
because I've only been studying stuff for days.

1410
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:36,620
I understand.

1411
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:38,420
I guess what I would say is that I,

1412
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:40,380
no, effective field theory is life, right?

1413
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:42,820
Like it's like, it's how the,

1414
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:45,740
it's how everything we organize, it's just,

1415
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:47,300
it's all we see, right?

1416
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:49,380
I'm living here in this like, there's not like,

1417
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:50,620
Newton's laws weren't wrong.

1418
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:52,740
They're just an effective theory relevant to our.

1419
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:54,260
If we were to talk about biology, right?

1420
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:55,740
So we have the stratification.

1421
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:57,700
We have cytology, the study of cells below.

1422
00:57:57,700 --> 00:57:59,380
Then we have histology, the study of tissues.

1423
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:00,900
And we have physiology above that.

1424
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:03,180
And we have the organization and anatomy.

1425
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:05,660
And if you stayed down at the level and saying, you know,

1426
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:09,060
it would be absolutely responsible for us to speculate

1427
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:11,180
into different regimes because we understand

1428
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:12,900
that we don't actually have information.

1429
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:15,820
We've learned the lesson of Ken Wilson very well.

1430
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:17,220
That would be pretty disappointing.

1431
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:19,740
If you think about, for example, Wheel of Fortune,

1432
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:21,620
there are these one letter solves

1433
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:24,580
where somebody actually guesses the entire puzzle

1434
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:25,620
from a single letter.

1435
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:27,060
Look up a guy named Rufus, for example.

1436
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:27,900
I understand.

1437
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:30,580
Now, my claim is, is that the, the,

1438
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:33,060
the dark side of the genius of Ken Wilson.

1439
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:35,140
And by the way, Ken Wilson is a good example.

1440
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:37,660
Like we just lost Jeff Becker, the guitarist.

1441
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:39,700
He was every professional electric guitarist,

1442
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:42,180
favorite guitarist, but he wasn't everybody's favorite

1443
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:43,940
guitarist who didn't play guitar.

1444
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:47,180
In a certain sense, Ken Wilson walks on water

1445
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:51,140
within the competent community of physics researchers.

1446
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:54,420
But there's a dark side also, just the way Jeff Becker

1447
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:57,500
maybe put too much emphasis on the whammy bar

1448
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:00,300
of pushing everything into this realm

1449
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:02,900
where it's denuded of much of its meaning.

1450
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:05,700
Like if I were to say to you that the Higgs field

1451
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:07,260
shows up in effective theory

1452
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:09,860
as a spin zero fundamental scalar,

1453
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:11,580
but I don't think that that's its purpose.

1454
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:14,540
I think that it actually belongs to the actual,

1455
00:59:14,540 --> 00:59:16,580
and the way in which it's disguised

1456
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:20,700
so that it's spin appears different than its naive spin,

1457
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:23,540
which is its function as a, as a part of a connection.

1458
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:28,300
That's something in which effective theory

1459
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:30,220
is not going to necessarily point to that

1460
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:34,060
because effective theory tends to show you this picture

1461
00:59:34,060 --> 00:59:36,180
that is often denuded of higher level structures

1462
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:38,540
because we're not too afraid to guess.

1463
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:41,140
No, the idea is just that it,

1464
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:45,620
you can have as wild a variation

1465
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:48,740
of the difference of the origin of two theories as you like.

1466
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:53,020
And if I limit my observations to some energy scale

1467
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:55,900
that's set by colliders or whatever I can do,

1468
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:58,140
that the only way that I can tell them apart

1469
00:59:58,140 --> 01:00:00,980
is by the parameters of the long distance.

1470
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:03,900
No, now the parameters can be really useful hints.

1471
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:08,460
So in the sixties, Weinberg guessed at asymptotic freedom,

1472
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:10,540
which was that the idea that they're like,

1473
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:13,060
the theory is really made up of quarks

1474
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:15,300
and things that look like microscopic particles

1475
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:18,100
just bouncing around, even though they live inside a proton.

1476
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:20,900
He guessed at this because of the specific relationships

1477
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:24,940
between certain of the couplings of nuclear physics

1478
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:26,940
because we couldn't go and look inside of the proton

1479
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:28,020
at that point in history.

1480
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:31,020
So it's absolutely true that through this lens

1481
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:32,820
you can discover exactly as you're seeing.

1482
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:35,260
You can within this lens say,

1483
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:38,260
there's a pattern here and I can use the tools

1484
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:40,300
at my disposal to say the only way to get this pattern

1485
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:42,780
points at some deeper structure.

1486
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:43,980
So that's exactly what we do.

1487
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:46,820
So for example, why proton decay experiments

1488
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:48,260
were so exciting because even though

1489
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:50,020
they're low energy experiment,

1490
01:00:50,020 --> 01:00:52,100
they would tell us about physics at very high energies

1491
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:55,500
because we only know a few ways to create proton decay

1492
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:57,300
or this is why people are really excited

1493
01:00:57,300 --> 01:00:59,620
to do treating masses because do treating masses hint

1494
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:02,780
at something going on at extremely high energies

1495
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:05,900
that will never ever be able to probe in the lab.

1496
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:08,380
But if you don't kind of, on the other hand,

1497
01:01:08,380 --> 01:01:10,940
like if I write down a theory that only changes

1498
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:13,500
the gears of how the universe works

1499
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:15,380
on some scale that I can never observe,

1500
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:17,900
my only hope is to see it through the pattern.

1501
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:19,540
What's going on with this one?

1502
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:21,700
You're mislearning the lesson of the baryon,

1503
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:23,580
which is that the baryon isn't decoded

1504
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:25,620
into the Lagrangian, the quarks are,

1505
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:29,780
but that, I don't even know if we're talking about it,

1506
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:34,020
say infrared slavery with physics conscience,

1507
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:37,940
but the issue is that protons and neutrons

1508
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:39,900
are not what is seen in the Lagrangian.

1509
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:41,740
You have to actually unpack them,

1510
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:44,540
unpack the fundamental constituents

1511
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:46,700
to get the observable constituents.

1512
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:48,780
Now that lesson when over learned,

1513
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:52,060
which is what I'm concerned your community has done,

1514
01:01:52,060 --> 01:01:55,300
becomes inhibitory and everybody gets innervated

1515
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:56,940
because nobody wants to be the fool

1516
01:01:56,940 --> 01:01:59,100
who didn't learn the lesson of effective theory

1517
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:00,180
and renormalization.

1518
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:02,100
And that's what's concerning me,

1519
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:04,860
is that in general, we have a group of people

1520
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:06,980
who are incredibly worried about their union card

1521
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:09,500
and being respectable and when they're heterodox,

1522
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:12,020
they're heterodox in the most mild and unhelpful way,

1523
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:14,500
particularly if you have a metastable state

1524
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:18,420
where small perturbations don't work out very well.

1525
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:20,100
And so in all of these situations,

1526
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:22,300
when I try to engage you in terms of,

1527
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:25,140
if you wanna actually talk physics on a podcast,

1528
01:02:25,180 --> 01:02:27,820
we always talk around physics, we talk about physics,

1529
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:29,860
but we don't actually say, well, what do you believe,

1530
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:32,700
what do you know, what are the high conviction gets?

1531
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:35,020
And I'll say something more.

1532
01:02:35,020 --> 01:02:37,780
I think you're an extremely good scientist.

1533
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:39,500
I've read some of your stuff.

1534
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:44,060
I don't aspire to be focused on good scientists

1535
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:46,420
because I believe that we have a confusion

1536
01:02:46,420 --> 01:02:50,140
that great science is just good science turned up to 11.

1537
01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:53,460
And I think if you, I had this conversation with Jim Watson,

1538
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:55,780
his basic point was we were not,

1539
01:02:55,780 --> 01:02:58,980
Watson Crick were not good scientists in Jim's view.

1540
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:00,300
He said, Rosalind Franklin was,

1541
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:02,580
and the reason she didn't get the double helix

1542
01:03:02,580 --> 01:03:04,020
was not because it was stolen,

1543
01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:05,940
which there are certainly issues,

1544
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:08,820
but because she refused to spend a day decamped

1545
01:03:08,820 --> 01:03:10,820
into the idea that the Maltese cross

1546
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:14,220
near X-ray crystallography represented a helix.

1547
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:17,740
And so his point was our search space is tiny

1548
01:03:17,740 --> 01:03:20,540
because we're only looking for helical models

1549
01:03:20,540 --> 01:03:23,140
and her search space was enormous

1550
01:03:23,140 --> 01:03:26,420
because she correctly viewed that that particular pattern

1551
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:28,340
was not sufficient to narrow it down.

1552
01:03:29,340 --> 01:03:32,020
But I mean, someone watching is just this passionate

1553
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:34,220
but has some knowledge of you and in the field.

1554
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:36,940
I mean, you've ruled out, just in words today

1555
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:39,340
and not to mention previous discussions we've had,

1556
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:44,700
alternative theories to anything but your own

1557
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:46,860
personal conviction, which is that she,

1558
01:03:46,860 --> 01:03:49,180
so you've ruled out E8, you've ruled out Wolfram,

1559
01:03:49,180 --> 01:03:51,140
you've ruled out loop quantum gravity.

1560
01:03:51,140 --> 01:03:52,940
Not, I think ruled it out like they shall be taken

1561
01:03:52,940 --> 01:03:53,780
behind the woodshed.

1562
01:03:53,780 --> 01:03:54,620
No, bro.

1563
01:03:55,460 --> 01:03:56,780
Well, so how much time-

1564
01:03:56,780 --> 01:04:00,380
I think we should be invested in cellular automata.

1565
01:04:00,380 --> 01:04:02,860
I think we really need to study the large exceptionally groups

1566
01:04:02,860 --> 01:04:04,740
inside of the TITS-Fordens' Rural Structure.

1567
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:06,580
The theories of everything.

1568
01:04:06,580 --> 01:04:09,420
I think that Peter Wojt's theory to begin with SU3,

1569
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:10,940
which is the one part of the symmetries

1570
01:04:10,940 --> 01:04:13,980
that doesn't have another name because U1 is also spin two,

1571
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:17,660
SO2 the circle, same thing with SU2 is the three sphere,

1572
01:04:17,660 --> 01:04:20,620
spin three, SU3 is unique in that it doesn't have

1573
01:04:20,620 --> 01:04:21,940
another name.

1574
01:04:21,940 --> 01:04:25,580
And so he begins with that and he sticks basically U3

1575
01:04:25,580 --> 01:04:27,540
inside of SU4.

1576
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:29,420
And I think it's a great idea.

1577
01:04:29,420 --> 01:04:32,060
And I don't want to be mischaracterized.

1578
01:04:32,060 --> 01:04:35,260
I am the only person pushing forward GU.

1579
01:04:36,580 --> 01:04:39,580
I am also pushing forward when I was asked recently

1580
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:40,980
by the Institute for Arts and Ideas.

1581
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:42,700
They wanted to say, well, tell us now about GU

1582
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:44,180
after you've done all this service to our field.

1583
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:45,820
I was like, no, I don't want to do that.

1584
01:04:45,820 --> 01:04:48,140
I would rather tell you about my competitors

1585
01:04:48,180 --> 01:04:50,900
in idiosyncratic fermionic space.

1586
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:52,580
It's you guys who don't do that.

1587
01:04:52,580 --> 01:04:55,660
So please don't put on me that I'm simply a proponent

1588
01:04:55,660 --> 01:04:57,060
that is always pushing my product

1589
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:58,860
and selling from the stage, far from it.

1590
01:04:58,860 --> 01:05:00,220
I don't think it's selling from it,

1591
01:05:00,220 --> 01:05:02,260
but it's just from a pragmatic standpoint.

1592
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:05,100
Daniel's got a limited amount of theoretical bandwidth.

1593
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:07,180
My students do as well.

1594
01:05:07,180 --> 01:05:08,260
It's not that much, Brian.

1595
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:09,860
Well, no, I agree with you.

1596
01:05:09,860 --> 01:05:12,220
I agree with you that to hear Sabine say,

1597
01:05:12,220 --> 01:05:14,140
well, she doesn't have time to look at your theory

1598
01:05:14,140 --> 01:05:16,020
and Garrett's theory and Wolfram's theory.

1599
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:17,020
She doesn't want to get sucked in.

1600
01:05:17,020 --> 01:05:19,820
She doesn't want to, but that doesn't prove that it's right.

1601
01:05:19,820 --> 01:05:21,860
I mean, it's not evidence that they're correct.

1602
01:05:21,860 --> 01:05:23,500
No, but it leaves the wrong impression.

1603
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:26,580
Right, and that's maybe not as collegial as it could be,

1604
01:05:26,580 --> 01:05:28,620
but there's a limited amount.

1605
01:05:28,620 --> 01:05:31,020
So the question is for working card carries,

1606
01:05:31,020 --> 01:05:32,420
you call them union members.

1607
01:05:32,420 --> 01:05:35,580
I mean, what is it about what you're doing

1608
01:05:35,580 --> 01:05:38,300
that is most exciting and most interesting to you

1609
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:40,740
and the reason that keeps you getting up in the morning

1610
01:05:40,740 --> 01:05:42,460
and thinking about it in the middle of the night?

1611
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:45,860
What questions or what contributions are so interesting

1612
01:05:45,860 --> 01:05:48,260
and promising along the, obviously promising

1613
01:05:48,260 --> 01:05:50,420
from the current research direction you're pursuing?

1614
01:05:50,420 --> 01:05:53,820
Okay, so I mean, what have I spent the past years working on

1615
01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:56,060
is trying to understand the sitter space.

1616
01:05:56,060 --> 01:05:58,500
Now, the sitter space seems to be the universe we live in.

1617
01:05:58,500 --> 01:05:59,620
It's also-

1618
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:00,820
What do you mean by that?

1619
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:04,020
As in the expansion of the universe right now.

1620
01:06:04,020 --> 01:06:04,860
It looks-

1621
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:05,700
It's approximately-

1622
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:06,540
It's approximately a sitter.

1623
01:06:06,540 --> 01:06:07,900
Okay, but there's a big difference.

1624
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:12,340
Okay, yes, but at the level of approximation

1625
01:06:12,340 --> 01:06:15,060
that the universe we live in seems to be a sitter,

1626
01:06:15,060 --> 01:06:18,220
we did not understand how to calculate things in the sitter.

1627
01:06:18,220 --> 01:06:20,220
And there are people who claim that,

1628
01:06:20,220 --> 01:06:21,860
the sitter was fundamentally unstable

1629
01:06:21,860 --> 01:06:24,460
because of various things that they couldn't calculate.

1630
01:06:24,460 --> 01:06:26,420
And this proved that like,

1631
01:06:26,420 --> 01:06:29,620
it's impossible to have a positive causal constant

1632
01:06:29,620 --> 01:06:31,540
for this reason or the other.

1633
01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:34,060
And so what I wanna, like,

1634
01:06:34,060 --> 01:06:35,980
why do I use effective field theory?

1635
01:06:35,980 --> 01:06:39,380
Because many of the calculations that people were saying

1636
01:06:39,380 --> 01:06:41,180
proved that this were like,

1637
01:06:41,180 --> 01:06:42,700
they were instantly,

1638
01:06:42,740 --> 01:06:45,020
you could see the mistake in the calculation.

1639
01:06:45,020 --> 01:06:46,380
So as you say, like,

1640
01:06:46,380 --> 01:06:47,540
yes, effective field theory,

1641
01:06:47,540 --> 01:06:50,580
you can have your blinders on to what might be interesting,

1642
01:06:50,580 --> 01:06:52,820
but more often than not in my career.

1643
01:06:52,820 --> 01:06:53,660
100%.

1644
01:06:53,660 --> 01:06:55,300
It's like the way you say,

1645
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:57,300
hey, that calculation have a mistake in it.

1646
01:06:57,300 --> 01:06:58,220
And like,

1647
01:06:58,220 --> 01:06:59,620
all the every time it's a mistake.

1648
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:01,380
It's like getting rid of pseudo tensors.

1649
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:04,140
It's a very good place to catch errors.

1650
01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:04,980
Absolutely.

1651
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:06,980
So I don't, I am in no way saying like,

1652
01:07:06,980 --> 01:07:09,020
it's not interesting to think about things that,

1653
01:07:09,020 --> 01:07:11,300
yeah, I'd be the first person excited about a thing

1654
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:13,580
that doesn't look like it lives in effective field theory.

1655
01:07:13,580 --> 01:07:14,420
Right?

1656
01:07:14,420 --> 01:07:15,700
And so that would be awesome.

1657
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:17,820
And I have friends who, you know, explore, you know,

1658
01:07:17,820 --> 01:07:19,260
modifications to quantum mechanics.

1659
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:20,100
And maybe that means

1660
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:22,700
or things that look like they violate the rules.

1661
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:25,100
Those are extremely exciting and interesting things

1662
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:27,660
that a lot of the people do seriously consider.

1663
01:07:27,660 --> 01:07:29,860
But again, if you don't start from,

1664
01:07:29,860 --> 01:07:32,860
but if I have a theory that fits a set of rule,

1665
01:07:32,860 --> 01:07:34,580
it has to follow the structure.

1666
01:07:34,580 --> 01:07:36,380
More often than not, you just do calculations wrong.

1667
01:07:36,380 --> 01:07:37,220
Right?

1668
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:38,060
And it's like, yeah,

1669
01:07:38,060 --> 01:07:39,500
you spend five years doing calculation

1670
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:41,020
or in some cases in this interspace,

1671
01:07:41,060 --> 01:07:44,980
like it was 30 years where people calculated things

1672
01:07:44,980 --> 01:07:47,780
over and over again and literally learn nothing.

1673
01:07:47,780 --> 01:07:49,420
There's tons of calculations

1674
01:07:49,420 --> 01:07:51,420
and we learned no lessons from it.

1675
01:07:51,420 --> 01:07:54,020
And the part of the point of effective field theory

1676
01:07:54,020 --> 01:07:55,740
is that like it just organizes

1677
01:07:55,740 --> 01:07:57,140
what are interesting calculations,

1678
01:07:57,140 --> 01:07:58,620
what the answer should look like.

1679
01:07:58,620 --> 01:08:00,620
And if something violates effective field theory,

1680
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:02,100
then at least you can go like,

1681
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:04,300
like waiter was the step that violated the rules.

1682
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:06,840
And if none of the steps violate the rules,

1683
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:08,020
then you've got a problem.

1684
01:08:08,020 --> 01:08:09,740
And so what I would say for me,

1685
01:08:09,740 --> 01:08:11,580
like the, what's the ultimate goal

1686
01:08:11,580 --> 01:08:13,100
of understanding disorder space?

1687
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:15,060
Like it is getting back to like,

1688
01:08:15,060 --> 01:08:17,100
what did the beginning of time look like?

1689
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:18,140
What is the space,

1690
01:08:18,140 --> 01:08:20,460
what are the space of possible universes?

1691
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:22,980
And like, is the multiverse a well-defined thing?

1692
01:08:22,980 --> 01:08:23,860
Does it even make sense?

1693
01:08:23,860 --> 01:08:26,140
Like these are questions that are enormous.

1694
01:08:26,140 --> 01:08:28,580
And, but we can't answer like,

1695
01:08:28,580 --> 01:08:30,180
there are people who want to jump to the like,

1696
01:08:30,180 --> 01:08:31,900
how do we define internal inflation

1697
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:33,820
and make up rules for calculating?

1698
01:08:33,820 --> 01:08:35,260
And they make up this and they make up that.

1699
01:08:35,260 --> 01:08:36,660
And they say, well, in my toy model

1700
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:38,220
with this rule and that rule, it does this.

1701
01:08:38,220 --> 01:08:42,020
It's like, we don't know enough to play those games.

1702
01:08:42,020 --> 01:08:43,700
And I guess that would be my point to you.

1703
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:46,340
You're like, in response to your comment

1704
01:08:46,340 --> 01:08:50,140
about great scientists is that the challenge

1705
01:08:50,140 --> 01:08:52,580
is ultimately going to be like, you know,

1706
01:08:52,580 --> 01:08:55,260
there are moments in history that just call

1707
01:08:55,260 --> 01:08:57,580
for careful analysis of the laws we have.

1708
01:08:57,580 --> 01:08:59,420
Well, in the normalization a certain sense was that.

1709
01:08:59,420 --> 01:09:00,260
Absolutely.

1710
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:01,860
And the same with like Lagrangian mechanics,

1711
01:09:01,860 --> 01:09:02,700
Hamiltonian mechanics.

1712
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:05,860
Like there's a huge time between Newton

1713
01:09:05,860 --> 01:09:07,700
and changes the laws and the science

1714
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:08,820
that happened there was super important.

1715
01:09:08,820 --> 01:09:10,580
The question is, what time is it?

1716
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:12,460
Is the time for a conservative revolution?

1717
01:09:12,460 --> 01:09:14,500
Is the time for a wildlife revolution?

1718
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:17,740
And I don't think it's responsible for anyone to say,

1719
01:09:17,740 --> 01:09:20,060
I know what time it is unless they have a very good reason

1720
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:21,340
for saying that they know what time it is.

1721
01:09:21,340 --> 01:09:23,660
So I think that to your earlier point,

1722
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:27,340
you want to let some conservative people hug the shore

1723
01:09:27,340 --> 01:09:29,380
and say, maybe we have a small error.

1724
01:09:30,580 --> 01:09:34,420
And you may also, I mean, the dressed and bare mass

1725
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:35,980
of the electron is a perfect example

1726
01:09:36,020 --> 01:09:39,060
of what seemed to be a small error that cost two decades.

1727
01:09:39,060 --> 01:09:42,740
So at a certain level, that's completely legitimate.

1728
01:09:42,740 --> 01:09:45,220
And what I see you doing with effective field theory

1729
01:09:45,220 --> 01:09:48,140
is in some sense using it as a substitute for experiment,

1730
01:09:48,140 --> 01:09:51,300
which is how do we test whether our wild ideas

1731
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:53,580
actually make a certain kind of sense?

1732
01:09:53,580 --> 01:09:55,860
And so I think it's very responsible

1733
01:09:55,860 --> 01:09:58,980
and part of the good science wrap that I'm sticking you with

1734
01:09:58,980 --> 01:10:01,300
is that you're trying to do something

1735
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:02,820
where you can't repeat the Big Bang.

1736
01:10:02,820 --> 01:10:04,500
You can't run an experiment in the lab

1737
01:10:04,820 --> 01:10:06,420
where everything goes right.

1738
01:10:06,420 --> 01:10:09,140
And effective theory is a great way of sorting

1739
01:10:09,140 --> 01:10:11,540
some amount of wheat from some amount of chaff

1740
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:14,820
provided that you always keep in mind

1741
01:10:14,820 --> 01:10:18,060
that it also carries certain sorts of distortions

1742
01:10:18,060 --> 01:10:20,420
that bias us against bold guesses

1743
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:22,980
because many of our structures recur

1744
01:10:22,980 --> 01:10:27,980
at various different strata of the effective stratification.

1745
01:10:28,220 --> 01:10:30,300
I do not disagree with that at all.

1746
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:32,540
And I completely agree that, you know,

1747
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:34,500
even in our corner of cosmology,

1748
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:37,060
like I would not characterize myself as a stringer,

1749
01:10:37,060 --> 01:10:39,220
but I have found string theory useful

1750
01:10:39,220 --> 01:10:42,140
because sometimes even though I have not found anything

1751
01:10:42,140 --> 01:10:44,260
that cannot be expressed as effective field theory,

1752
01:10:44,260 --> 01:10:46,540
like it does push us in a weird direction.

1753
01:10:46,540 --> 01:10:48,380
There's like that idea came out of left field

1754
01:10:48,380 --> 01:10:50,500
and suitably reinterpreted.

1755
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:51,820
It was a really cool thing to look for.

1756
01:10:51,820 --> 01:10:54,340
This is what Nima said to me about Ravita Schwinger fields

1757
01:10:54,340 --> 01:10:56,300
in the Bella Swanseger problem, as he said,

1758
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:59,180
that it's very tricky to couple Ravita Schwinger

1759
01:10:59,180 --> 01:11:02,300
to external or to internal degrees of freedom

1760
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:04,380
without having superluminal problems.

1761
01:11:04,380 --> 01:11:06,660
String theory showed us a way to do that.

1762
01:11:06,660 --> 01:11:09,340
And so whether or not you're a string advocate

1763
01:11:09,340 --> 01:11:11,140
or not a string advocate,

1764
01:11:11,140 --> 01:11:13,780
you at least wanna help yourself to the bounty

1765
01:11:13,780 --> 01:11:14,980
that came from this theory,

1766
01:11:14,980 --> 01:11:17,460
which is one of the reasons why I'm absolutely not

1767
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:19,740
for ending support for string theory.

1768
01:11:19,740 --> 01:11:21,740
But the part of the problem is that this space

1769
01:11:21,740 --> 01:11:23,420
is so polluted by stupidity

1770
01:11:23,420 --> 01:11:26,700
that world's smartest people acting like jackasses

1771
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:31,220
is that we're not having this conversation fresh and new.

1772
01:11:31,260 --> 01:11:33,980
We're having this conversation after not even wrong.

1773
01:11:33,980 --> 01:11:36,500
After, you know, and part of the problem is,

1774
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:38,260
is that the field became not even Pauly.

1775
01:11:38,260 --> 01:11:41,020
Pauly was a dick and he was famously a dick.

1776
01:11:41,020 --> 01:11:42,100
He was a witty dick.

1777
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:45,100
He was a very high, you know, very high standards.

1778
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:46,900
I don't know, you know, Switzerland,

1779
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:48,300
they're very precise over there.

1780
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:49,620
But the fact of the matter is,

1781
01:11:49,620 --> 01:11:52,700
is that he's a terrible person for most people to emulate

1782
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:54,980
because it's basically put down physics.

1783
01:11:54,980 --> 01:11:56,980
And so, you know, what I really believe is

1784
01:11:56,980 --> 01:11:59,260
you're trying to do good science, you're a new generation.

1785
01:11:59,260 --> 01:12:01,940
I don't want you meshed in some of these battles,

1786
01:12:01,940 --> 01:12:04,900
but I also don't want you on the field of battle,

1787
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:06,460
sort of muddling the stuff and saying,

1788
01:12:06,460 --> 01:12:08,580
well, there are actually a lot of interesting things.

1789
01:12:08,580 --> 01:12:11,420
We have certain things that we need to get to

1790
01:12:11,420 --> 01:12:14,900
in order to make sure that as this generation before me

1791
01:12:14,900 --> 01:12:17,740
exits the stage, they leave the situation

1792
01:12:17,740 --> 01:12:18,700
like the cat in the hat.

1793
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:20,620
They've made a complete mess of things.

1794
01:12:20,620 --> 01:12:22,300
And it's important that they straighten things up

1795
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:23,820
before mom gets home.

1796
01:12:23,820 --> 01:12:26,700
Yeah, but I guess I would, I would,

1797
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:27,860
I don't disagree.

1798
01:12:27,860 --> 01:12:30,380
There are a lot of things that need to be cleaned up

1799
01:12:30,380 --> 01:12:32,820
to make it, you know, but I think that it comes

1800
01:12:32,820 --> 01:12:33,820
in many forms.

1801
01:12:33,820 --> 01:12:38,300
And the problem is that the problem is that it's like,

1802
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:40,620
you can say, oh, it'd be good if, you know,

1803
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:41,580
people came and fix it.

1804
01:12:41,580 --> 01:12:45,980
It is like a handful of people who whose opinions,

1805
01:12:45,980 --> 01:12:48,460
like just saying things carry anyway.

1806
01:12:48,460 --> 01:12:50,740
Most people, it's the accumulation of a life

1807
01:12:50,740 --> 01:12:53,160
of work in the community that eventually move the field.

1808
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:55,900
So like an example is like scattering amplitudes.

1809
01:12:55,900 --> 01:12:58,540
Like, you know, there's an like incredibly great

1810
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:00,820
physicists who spent their entire lives working on it.

1811
01:13:00,820 --> 01:13:03,980
And the way that they, like their results became part

1812
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:07,200
of the rest of the community because of the sheer weight

1813
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:08,420
of what they had been doing.

1814
01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:11,220
It was not because it was like they get a compelling talk

1815
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:13,780
or because like people, you know, but it was like really

1816
01:13:13,780 --> 01:13:15,740
that it was just like, eventually they just solve

1817
01:13:15,740 --> 01:13:17,460
so many problems that people were like,

1818
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:20,040
and look at the great, like this double copy problem

1819
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:21,760
is really exciting.

1820
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:22,600
Absolutely.

1821
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:23,580
And the amplitude, right.

1822
01:13:24,420 --> 01:13:26,740
But again, what I would say is like,

1823
01:13:26,740 --> 01:13:30,460
but that's where I see that like, I don't,

1824
01:13:30,460 --> 01:13:33,060
like your point of view is like the field is gonna change

1825
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:36,620
when these people have to exit the stage and like,

1826
01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:38,780
and I think to be honest, like I think a lot of people

1827
01:13:38,780 --> 01:13:40,740
younger than already see these problems.

1828
01:13:40,740 --> 01:13:43,180
And it's just that like, they're like the way,

1829
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:45,060
they're not, they don't have Edwitton's name.

1830
01:13:45,060 --> 01:13:47,660
They don't have one's name, but they see what you're

1831
01:13:47,660 --> 01:13:50,620
talking about and the way that that's gonna manifest

1832
01:13:50,620 --> 01:13:52,740
itself is that in 20 years you're gonna look back

1833
01:13:52,740 --> 01:13:53,900
and say, that's what the field is.

1834
01:13:53,900 --> 01:13:58,900
Many of these people don't know the hypercharge

1835
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:02,540
or the weak ice to spin on the fundamental fields.

1836
01:14:02,540 --> 01:14:05,780
And I hate to say this this way, but I've dealt

1837
01:14:05,780 --> 01:14:08,140
with people who are quite a bit younger than I am,

1838
01:14:08,140 --> 01:14:10,260
who are working in this area of fundamental physics.

1839
01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:12,460
And I start to talk to them about the field content

1840
01:14:12,460 --> 01:14:14,100
of the standard model.

1841
01:14:14,100 --> 01:14:15,620
And it's astounding what they say.

1842
01:14:15,620 --> 01:14:17,780
They say things like, oh yeah, I remember this

1843
01:14:17,780 --> 01:14:19,460
in graduate school.

1844
01:14:19,460 --> 01:14:21,140
What the FD mean?

1845
01:14:21,140 --> 01:14:23,540
You're talking about the fundamental constituents

1846
01:14:23,540 --> 01:14:26,220
of nature and you can't remember the charge

1847
01:14:26,220 --> 01:14:28,660
on the strange cork.

1848
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:31,500
You can't remember whether it's, you know, upper deck.

1849
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:35,700
There is some problem in which people have actually

1850
01:14:35,700 --> 01:14:37,980
departed physics.

1851
01:14:37,980 --> 01:14:40,420
I think, I think, I know exactly what you're saying.

1852
01:14:40,420 --> 01:14:43,420
And I know there are phenomenal like that.

1853
01:14:43,420 --> 01:14:46,260
So a version of that, which I think is a fair criticism.

1854
01:14:46,260 --> 01:14:49,340
I don't know the names, but I've heard the story

1855
01:14:49,340 --> 01:14:54,140
that someone was up for a PhD at their PhD defense

1856
01:14:54,140 --> 01:14:57,180
and they were asked, what is the wavelength of visible light?

1857
01:14:57,180 --> 01:14:59,900
And the person said, one meter.

1858
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:03,700
And the examiner said, do I look blurry to you?

1859
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:05,620
And like, that's the kind of like, you should have

1860
01:15:05,620 --> 01:15:08,500
real world intuition about like, in that case,

1861
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:09,620
it's very obvious.

1862
01:15:09,620 --> 01:15:10,900
I mean, I would say like, I can't,

1863
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:12,740
I don't memorize the periodic table.

1864
01:15:12,740 --> 01:15:14,500
I mean, the periodic table is obviously important.

1865
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:18,420
No, no, no, it's not the, it's 15 or 16 entries

1866
01:15:18,460 --> 01:15:19,820
in a column vector.

1867
01:15:20,780 --> 01:15:22,860
But again, like you're asking like, could I,

1868
01:15:22,860 --> 01:15:24,580
if you woke me up in the middle of the night,

1869
01:15:24,580 --> 01:15:27,700
could I reproduce every single term in the standard model?

1870
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:30,260
Like, you know, like, I don't know that I could.

1871
01:15:30,260 --> 01:15:31,900
I could get most, I could get most of it.

1872
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:34,820
I could get most of it, but it doesn't matter to me

1873
01:15:34,820 --> 01:15:36,820
in my, in my particular research.

1874
01:15:36,820 --> 01:15:39,580
Wait a second, I want to understand.

1875
01:15:39,580 --> 01:15:42,940
You're not carrying around a copy

1876
01:15:43,820 --> 01:15:47,780
of the representation theory of SU3 cross SU2 cross U1

1877
01:15:47,820 --> 01:15:50,580
and 15 or 16 dimensional complex space.

1878
01:15:50,580 --> 01:15:54,060
I'm carrying in a particle data book.

1879
01:15:54,060 --> 01:15:58,380
Look, not a spark quiz, there's no spark quiz because.

1880
01:15:58,380 --> 01:16:00,220
I know exactly where to look it up when I'm writing.

1881
01:16:00,220 --> 01:16:02,580
I know what most of the terms are,

1882
01:16:02,580 --> 01:16:04,900
but if you had to get me like, what is the exact?

1883
01:16:06,380 --> 01:16:08,860
For the same reason that memorizing a poem is important

1884
01:16:08,860 --> 01:16:11,060
because you can always look it up,

1885
01:16:11,060 --> 01:16:13,340
but you're not going to be able to have it.

1886
01:16:13,340 --> 01:16:16,860
If it's not cached close to the prefrontal cortex,

1887
01:16:16,860 --> 01:16:19,540
you're not going to be able to make use of it in real time.

1888
01:16:19,540 --> 01:16:20,980
It's essential.

1889
01:16:20,980 --> 01:16:22,660
And I'm not talking, by the way,

1890
01:16:22,660 --> 01:16:25,260
about understanding all the hadronic resonances

1891
01:16:25,260 --> 01:16:28,020
or anything like that.

1892
01:16:28,020 --> 01:16:30,940
What I'm trying to say is the sense of,

1893
01:16:30,940 --> 01:16:33,780
oh yeah, that's that stuff I learned in graduate school.

1894
01:16:33,780 --> 01:16:34,620
Is it?

1895
01:16:34,620 --> 01:16:37,660
I think to answer for Dan, that he doesn't need it.

1896
01:16:37,660 --> 01:16:38,900
What Feynman said would apply.

1897
01:16:38,900 --> 01:16:40,340
I mean, Feynman would disagree with you and say,

1898
01:16:40,340 --> 01:16:42,380
what I can't derive, I don't understand.

1899
01:16:42,380 --> 01:16:44,220
He didn't say, what I can't memorize, I don't understand.

1900
01:16:44,220 --> 01:16:45,060
That's not a question of that.

1901
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:46,940
It's a question of, for example,

1902
01:16:46,940 --> 01:16:49,500
let's forget the exact, you know,

1903
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:51,660
weak hypercharges summits.

1904
01:16:51,660 --> 01:16:54,940
You can write down the pseudocode

1905
01:16:54,940 --> 01:16:56,660
of the standard model of logic.

1906
01:16:56,660 --> 01:16:57,820
Absolutely, for sure.

1907
01:16:57,820 --> 01:16:59,500
So that's, first of all,

1908
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:01,140
I'm talking about people who can't do that.

1909
01:17:01,140 --> 01:17:02,740
Oh, I understand what you mean.

1910
01:17:02,740 --> 01:17:04,340
And I do agree that there's a problem,

1911
01:17:04,340 --> 01:17:08,780
but at the same time, like, I think there's the like,

1912
01:17:08,780 --> 01:17:09,940
should we do the standard,

1913
01:17:09,940 --> 01:17:12,180
should like, just as an intellectual endeavor,

1914
01:17:12,180 --> 01:17:14,020
should we remember, should we pass down

1915
01:17:14,020 --> 01:17:14,900
the things that we've learned,

1916
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:16,500
we should definitely make sure

1917
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:17,340
the standard model is not put out.

1918
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:20,180
I'm saying that the younger people that we're discussing,

1919
01:17:20,180 --> 01:17:23,300
the consequence of not having this reconciliation,

1920
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:26,380
by the way, of understanding what quantum gravity

1921
01:17:26,380 --> 01:17:30,180
did to this field, is that we have a number of people

1922
01:17:30,180 --> 01:17:33,300
who are not intact in their research careers,

1923
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:34,580
who are not in a position,

1924
01:17:34,580 --> 01:17:37,460
if the answer came screaming across their field of view,

1925
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:39,220
they wouldn't necessarily recognize.

1926
01:17:39,220 --> 01:17:41,900
But I would say there's similarly a problem,

1927
01:17:41,900 --> 01:17:43,740
it has nothing to do with quantum gravity,

1928
01:17:43,780 --> 01:17:45,580
which was that the response to all of this

1929
01:17:45,580 --> 01:17:47,700
is that particle physics has become de-forced

1930
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:48,540
from experiment.

1931
01:17:48,540 --> 01:17:50,380
And the problem is that particle theorists

1932
01:17:50,380 --> 01:17:51,620
don't know what it's going to experiment.

1933
01:17:51,620 --> 01:17:53,420
And that has pushed to the point

1934
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:56,340
that most young people that I talk to

1935
01:17:56,340 --> 01:17:57,780
who are particle phenomenologists,

1936
01:17:57,780 --> 01:17:59,260
now there are people who previously

1937
01:17:59,260 --> 01:18:01,740
would have known the standard model had a written down.

1938
01:18:01,740 --> 01:18:04,540
Their feeling now is that like, for them to get a job,

1939
01:18:04,540 --> 01:18:05,860
and again, is this actually true

1940
01:18:05,860 --> 01:18:07,100
or just so what they perceive?

1941
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:08,580
It's probably some of both,

1942
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:11,060
but they feel they have to have an experiment

1943
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:12,380
with their name on it,

1944
01:18:12,380 --> 01:18:13,380
because otherwise people will say,

1945
01:18:13,380 --> 01:18:15,020
well, they're not in touch with the real world.

1946
01:18:15,020 --> 01:18:15,860
So let's get,

1947
01:18:15,860 --> 01:18:17,740
we need to get you guys more money.

1948
01:18:17,740 --> 01:18:18,580
That would be fantastic.

1949
01:18:18,580 --> 01:18:19,540
No, that's what we,

1950
01:18:19,540 --> 01:18:20,700
what I always say,

1951
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:23,300
what we need to do is to give my detractors,

1952
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:25,100
my people who are not critics,

1953
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:26,460
but actually assholes,

1954
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:27,540
more money,

1955
01:18:27,540 --> 01:18:30,260
because what you're seeing is the dynamics

1956
01:18:30,260 --> 01:18:33,180
of hunger game mentality inside of physics.

1957
01:18:33,180 --> 01:18:34,860
And as a result of this,

1958
01:18:34,860 --> 01:18:37,420
we're not able to behave constructively,

1959
01:18:37,420 --> 01:18:39,740
we're not able to behave collegially,

1960
01:18:39,740 --> 01:18:41,420
when we separate ourselves

1961
01:18:41,420 --> 01:18:45,220
so that certain people on stage never encounter critic.

1962
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:47,780
I was at Seifu in 2011, I believe,

1963
01:18:47,780 --> 01:18:49,820
where Joe Pulczynski and Eva Silverstein

1964
01:18:49,820 --> 01:18:52,300
were talking about string theory in one of the rooms.

1965
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:54,620
And I went in and I listened to Joe's version

1966
01:18:54,620 --> 01:18:56,460
of the history of string theory and I raised my hand.

1967
01:18:56,460 --> 01:18:59,140
I said, they're like seven or eight things

1968
01:18:59,140 --> 01:19:01,460
that you just said that are not true.

1969
01:19:01,460 --> 01:19:03,660
And I went through them and Joe too is credit.

1970
01:19:03,660 --> 01:19:05,540
I said, yep, yep, that's fair.

1971
01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:06,780
Yeah, that's true.

1972
01:19:06,780 --> 01:19:08,900
That happened the way you said it, not the way I said it.

1973
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:11,380
And I watched Eva go white, right?

1974
01:19:11,380 --> 01:19:13,060
She was just like, he's gonna have to speak.

1975
01:19:13,060 --> 01:19:15,300
And she had had previously prepared slides

1976
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:18,100
that duplicated many of the same claims.

1977
01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:19,780
One of which, for example, is that it wasn't

1978
01:19:19,780 --> 01:19:22,380
that we never thought about higher dimensional brains.

1979
01:19:22,380 --> 01:19:23,460
It was called string theory

1980
01:19:23,460 --> 01:19:24,780
because there were actual arguments

1981
01:19:24,780 --> 01:19:26,980
that those higher dimensional brains were guaranteed

1982
01:19:26,980 --> 01:19:28,700
not to be part of the theory.

1983
01:19:28,700 --> 01:19:31,580
And so once you actually go through the reconciliation

1984
01:19:31,580 --> 01:19:34,300
where you say, let's talk about the eight times we were wrong.

1985
01:19:34,300 --> 01:19:36,100
We said that there were finite number of theories,

1986
01:19:36,100 --> 01:19:37,460
then there turned out to be a continuum

1987
01:19:37,460 --> 01:19:39,340
where those things were extreme.

1988
01:19:39,340 --> 01:19:40,860
I can go on and on and on.

1989
01:19:40,860 --> 01:19:45,860
In all of those situations, by not forcing people to say,

1990
01:19:46,060 --> 01:19:47,020
yeah, we were wrong.

1991
01:19:47,020 --> 01:19:49,140
And Joe Pulczynski is a really good example.

1992
01:19:49,140 --> 01:19:50,660
I was pleased to see him on your list,

1993
01:19:50,660 --> 01:19:53,380
not for string theoretic issues or quantum gravity,

1994
01:19:53,380 --> 01:19:55,300
but because of the effective theory.

1995
01:19:55,300 --> 01:19:58,140
And he was a good enough scientist to say,

1996
01:19:58,140 --> 01:20:00,220
you know what, you got me, you're right.

1997
01:20:00,220 --> 01:20:02,100
He also said to me something, which, you know,

1998
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:03,180
I want to be in the world.

1999
01:20:03,180 --> 01:20:05,340
He said, you, Eric, talk a lot about quantum gravity

2000
01:20:05,340 --> 01:20:06,180
and string theory.

2001
01:20:06,180 --> 01:20:07,820
And sometimes I don't think string theory exists.

2002
01:20:07,820 --> 01:20:08,780
I said, what?

2003
01:20:08,780 --> 01:20:10,780
He said, sometimes I just think we're running subroutines

2004
01:20:10,780 --> 01:20:11,900
for Ed.

2005
01:20:11,900 --> 01:20:14,060
And I thought that that was a profound moment

2006
01:20:14,060 --> 01:20:16,500
that in general, one of the things that happened,

2007
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:19,140
which you may or may not know or feel or understand,

2008
01:20:19,140 --> 01:20:21,820
is that when you would come up with a new idea,

2009
01:20:21,820 --> 01:20:23,860
in a previous generation, everyone would look around

2010
01:20:23,860 --> 01:20:25,620
and say, well, what does Ed say?

2011
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:27,940
And it had to do with the fact that people felt

2012
01:20:27,940 --> 01:20:29,820
that Ed was channeling the cosmos,

2013
01:20:29,820 --> 01:20:31,780
like Jimi Hendrix played the guitar differently

2014
01:20:31,780 --> 01:20:33,220
than everybody else.

2015
01:20:33,220 --> 01:20:34,900
And so it was like, well, what would Jimmy say?

2016
01:20:34,900 --> 01:20:35,740
What would Jimmy do?

2017
01:20:35,740 --> 01:20:36,660
What would Jesus do?

2018
01:20:36,660 --> 01:20:38,260
And you can't do that.

2019
01:20:38,260 --> 01:20:40,300
You have to actually say, well, here's my opinion.

2020
01:20:40,660 --> 01:20:45,020
I may be wrong, but the fact is we have to go back

2021
01:20:45,020 --> 01:20:48,060
and say, why do we have this fictitious history

2022
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:49,380
of the last 40 years?

2023
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:51,900
And let's also celebrate all the great stuff

2024
01:20:51,900 --> 01:20:54,500
as per your thread and also my arguments

2025
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:56,740
about the fact that we actually put quantum field theory

2026
01:20:56,740 --> 01:20:57,860
on a more solid basis.

2027
01:20:57,860 --> 01:20:59,700
It's highly geometric.

2028
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:01,860
And I believe that the geometrization of quantum field

2029
01:21:01,860 --> 01:21:04,060
theory and its divorce from physics

2030
01:21:04,060 --> 01:21:06,620
is one of the great intellectual achievements of our time.

2031
01:21:06,620 --> 01:21:08,500
And it deserves to be celebrated.

2032
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:09,860
It's just like wrong way, Kerrigan.

2033
01:21:09,860 --> 01:21:11,500
You think that you're going to end up as Lindbergh,

2034
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:13,460
but you end up going the wrong direction.

2035
01:21:13,460 --> 01:21:16,220
All right, well, this has been the end of round one

2036
01:21:18,380 --> 01:21:21,780
of this thriller in San Diego.

2037
01:21:21,780 --> 01:21:23,420
I want to thank both of you guys.

2038
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:25,820
And hopefully we can do a round two,

2039
01:21:25,820 --> 01:21:28,420
but actually I'm more interested in doing something,

2040
01:21:28,420 --> 01:21:31,340
not on camera with you guys and just going through

2041
01:21:31,340 --> 01:21:32,940
some really fun physics.

2042
01:21:32,940 --> 01:21:36,980
I learned so much from you, both of you guys.

2043
01:21:37,020 --> 01:21:40,340
And I think Dan is really a role model

2044
01:21:40,340 --> 01:21:42,380
for many young physicists.

2045
01:21:42,380 --> 01:21:44,420
I said it in the previous podcast,

2046
01:21:44,420 --> 01:21:46,300
never have I been so glad to be a goner,

2047
01:21:46,300 --> 01:21:48,580
to be a thief, to steal your life from other universities.

2048
01:21:48,580 --> 01:21:50,580
Cause I think you really do exemplify

2049
01:21:50,580 --> 01:21:53,020
what a theorist or what a physicist should be.

2050
01:21:53,020 --> 01:21:54,500
Not a theorist, an experiment.

2051
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:57,420
You're interested in both and you're curious.

2052
01:21:57,420 --> 01:21:58,740
And then that means so much to me.

2053
01:21:58,740 --> 01:22:02,780
And Eric, of course, is always so delightful

2054
01:22:02,780 --> 01:22:04,620
because you know, I used to say,

2055
01:22:04,620 --> 01:22:05,980
the way to put a physicist down and say,

2056
01:22:05,980 --> 01:22:09,060
well, he or she knows the history of the field really well.

2057
01:22:09,060 --> 01:22:11,300
But you put your money where your mouth is.

2058
01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:12,540
You're very devoted to it.

2059
01:22:12,540 --> 01:22:14,740
I don't think it's for personal attention.

2060
01:22:14,740 --> 01:22:16,580
I don't think it's for, you know,

2061
01:22:16,580 --> 01:22:19,540
the satisfaction of fighting the previous wars

2062
01:22:19,540 --> 01:22:20,900
as generals often do.

2063
01:22:20,900 --> 01:22:23,140
But I think it's for the sake of heaven

2064
01:22:23,140 --> 01:22:25,340
in the sense that we are trying to understand

2065
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:26,580
a universe that we came into.

2066
01:22:26,580 --> 01:22:27,940
And we are like those fish

2067
01:22:27,940 --> 01:22:29,980
that don't really know what the water is.

2068
01:22:29,980 --> 01:22:32,020
And you guys helped clarify, for me,

2069
01:22:32,020 --> 01:22:34,380
simple experimental cosmology.

2070
01:22:34,380 --> 01:22:36,980
So now I want you guys to say one thing about Dan.

2071
01:22:36,980 --> 01:22:38,620
Yes, yes, sir, yes, please.

2072
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:41,420
I also think that people often on the internet

2073
01:22:41,420 --> 01:22:42,980
would post these popcorn memes.

2074
01:22:42,980 --> 01:22:44,740
Oh, people are going to conflict.

2075
01:22:44,740 --> 01:22:47,300
And the reason that we don't get great fights on the internet

2076
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:48,380
that are actually productive

2077
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:50,460
and that help us learn about the subject

2078
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:52,740
is because we don't have a sense of Queensborough rules.

2079
01:22:52,740 --> 01:22:54,580
And one of the things that I just think is terrific

2080
01:22:54,580 --> 01:22:57,220
about Dan, who I've never met before,

2081
01:22:57,220 --> 01:22:59,420
is that I had a high level of trust

2082
01:23:00,460 --> 01:23:02,900
that he was focused on the physics

2083
01:23:02,900 --> 01:23:06,300
and not on scoring points, dunking and dragging.

2084
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:08,860
I think people don't remember what a critic is.

2085
01:23:08,860 --> 01:23:11,340
I believe that Dan has a certain sense of my critic

2086
01:23:11,340 --> 01:23:12,620
and I his.

2087
01:23:12,620 --> 01:23:15,020
But the point is not to blind him

2088
01:23:15,020 --> 01:23:17,740
or do small knuckle manipulations.

2089
01:23:17,740 --> 01:23:19,940
Iron chic jumping, turnbuckle.

2090
01:23:19,940 --> 01:23:23,140
The key point is if you want really good conflict,

2091
01:23:23,140 --> 01:23:24,860
you have to establish Queensborough rules

2092
01:23:24,860 --> 01:23:27,020
by people who are not going to go for the jug killer,

2093
01:23:27,020 --> 01:23:29,340
bite off an ear when they're in one of these things.

2094
01:23:29,340 --> 01:23:30,500
And it's been an absolute pleasure

2095
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:31,900
to come down and have this conversation.

2096
01:23:31,900 --> 01:23:34,820
So touch gloves, Dan, anything else you wanna say?

2097
01:23:34,820 --> 01:23:38,220
I would say, I mean, I do, even that thread,

2098
01:23:38,220 --> 01:23:40,580
I would say part of the role of a critic

2099
01:23:40,580 --> 01:23:42,220
is not to be negative all the time.

2100
01:23:42,220 --> 01:23:44,420
I mean, the real value of the critic

2101
01:23:44,420 --> 01:23:46,940
is by being negative at times,

2102
01:23:46,940 --> 01:23:49,180
when they're positive, it gives real meaning.

2103
01:23:49,180 --> 01:23:52,780
And so I view that as a, nobody's being positive up there

2104
01:23:52,780 --> 01:23:54,860
and let me be positive out in the world.

2105
01:23:54,860 --> 01:23:57,140
And look forward to big things to come from Dan

2106
01:23:57,140 --> 01:24:00,580
and another episode with Eric coming out soon.

2107
01:24:00,580 --> 01:24:02,940
For now, Brian Keating joining you

2108
01:24:02,940 --> 01:24:04,940
from University of California, San Diego.

2109
01:24:04,940 --> 01:24:07,300
We're blessed to have brilliant colleagues

2110
01:24:07,300 --> 01:24:09,860
like Dan Green and friends of the show,

2111
01:24:09,860 --> 01:24:10,820
like Eric Wineside.

2112
01:24:10,820 --> 01:24:12,740
Stay tuned, more great episodes coming up.

2113
01:24:12,740 --> 01:24:14,980

2114
01:24:14,980 --> 01:24:18,140
