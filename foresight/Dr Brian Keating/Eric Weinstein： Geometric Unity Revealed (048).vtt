WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.920
Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.

00:10.920 --> 00:16.880
A friend, a sort of superhero in some sense, although I'm going to try to challenge you

00:16.880 --> 00:20.720
on a couple of things in your theories and in your politics and so forth today.

00:20.720 --> 00:23.320
I hope we'll have a wide-ranging conversation.

00:23.320 --> 00:27.120
But Eric Weinstein, pleasure to welcome you onto the Into the Impossible podcast.

00:28.000 --> 00:33.360
Brian, it's a total pleasure to be here and I appreciate your strategy to build them up first

00:33.360 --> 00:37.280
for an initial dopamine hit and then tear them down later during the remainder of the podcast.

00:37.280 --> 00:40.880
That's right. Well, I always say, you know, I got that from your mother and if you want,

00:40.880 --> 00:45.520
I can get it from your mother-in-law, how to introduce you. But either way, I think you're

00:45.520 --> 00:54.080
in good shape. So I had on my podcast a couple of weeks ago now, a certain mathematician and

00:54.160 --> 00:59.360
that mathematician generated some controversy, as they would say, in his homeland.

00:59.360 --> 01:05.200
And I want to just say that the mathematician's last name begins with a W. I won't say who it is,

01:05.200 --> 01:10.960
but I want you to sort of opine on this and let me know your feelings, how you would react to it

01:10.960 --> 01:17.520
if the W stood for, let's just say, Weinstein. So it said, mathematician W, it has been said

01:17.520 --> 01:23.040
about his theory, is that it's not clear what his goals are. He says he wants the intention

01:23.120 --> 01:28.320
and feedback of the physics community, but his unconventional approach, soliciting public comments

01:28.320 --> 01:35.600
on exceedingly long results from perhaps long ago, almost endures and shall it remain obscure.

01:36.400 --> 01:43.520
Mathematician W says he wants physicists respect. The ones consulted said gaining it would require

01:43.520 --> 01:49.040
him to recognize and engage with the prior work of others in the scientific community.

01:49.040 --> 01:53.440
So this is not written about Weinstein, just spoiler alert, it's written about somebody else,

01:54.080 --> 01:57.520
another person I have great respect for, but I'm curious.

01:57.520 --> 01:58.640
But who's not a mathematician?

01:59.200 --> 02:01.440
Who is not a mathematician. Right.

02:01.440 --> 02:06.160
Yeah. So what do you think about this? Is this something that you can abide by or

02:06.800 --> 02:11.200
what's your feeling on those sort of sentiment expressed by the author in this quote?

02:11.200 --> 02:13.920
Well, this is a very difficult question and a very interesting one.

02:14.000 --> 02:22.000
What I've been opining on recently is that we have two communities that are behaving very strangely.

02:22.720 --> 02:29.040
And one community is central to the institutional world of science.

02:29.040 --> 02:31.280
And the other is outside of that world.

02:32.160 --> 02:38.720
Now, traditionally in very difficult fields like physics, we assume that people who are working

02:38.720 --> 02:41.440
outside of an institutional framework are cranks.

02:42.560 --> 02:45.440
And there are reasons that that has been a good general bet.

02:47.040 --> 02:51.440
I think that you'd have to say that it has almost always been correct,

02:53.280 --> 02:55.920
at least with respect to fundamental physics.

02:56.480 --> 03:01.760
But we've developed a new problem, which is you'd like to say that many of the core

03:02.800 --> 03:06.480
research programs currently, let's say at the heart of theoretical physics,

03:07.440 --> 03:13.280
are fringe. But how can you call something fringe if it's at the center of respectability?

03:14.800 --> 03:19.680
Because fringe means two things. One, it means peripheral, which these things cannot be because

03:19.680 --> 03:25.040
they lie at the heart of our institutional science and our institutional sense making.

03:25.040 --> 03:34.240
But wacky, yes, they are. So when you have a wacky center and you have a wacky fringe,

03:35.040 --> 03:40.800
you need different language. And so I've come up with the term knark for the wacky center,

03:40.800 --> 03:46.320
which is cranks spelled backwards. So right now, the problem that you have is you have a very

03:46.320 --> 03:50.800
difficult situation. The language is too impoverished to capture what is going on.

03:51.520 --> 03:55.600
Most of the people who are wacky at the center of theoretical physics

03:57.280 --> 04:02.080
are competent. That is, if the field suddenly knew what it was doing again.

04:02.800 --> 04:07.120
And when I say theoretical physics, there's just one stupid gotcha way to get through. I mean

04:07.120 --> 04:12.160
fundamental physics. I mean the kind of physics that you go to bookstores to read about to fill

04:12.160 --> 04:18.400
your soul with wonder. Right. And that's the topic of this latest physicist who starts with a W

04:18.400 --> 04:31.280
is project. I mean, Stephen Wolff. Figured it out. Skadoosh. So the situation is that

04:31.280 --> 04:35.600
I think that if the Institute for Advanced Study were to get their hands on the next

04:35.600 --> 04:40.720
great thing, they would instantly go back to being regular style physicists.

04:41.680 --> 04:45.120
And I'm not positive that most of the crank community would do that.

04:46.400 --> 04:51.360
In some sense, what's gone on in the center is that you have physicists who are like generals

04:51.360 --> 04:55.600
who haven't fought a war in forever, but have been playing war games and have increasingly

04:56.560 --> 05:02.000
come to believe that the war games that they're playing is actually the business of the general,

05:02.720 --> 05:07.920
nor a soldier or a sergeant. And in fact, what they've been doing is playing with toy theories

05:07.920 --> 05:11.600
that don't seem to really be attempting to do what they're supposed to be doing.

05:12.320 --> 05:19.200
So nobody knows what to do with this circumstance. And having the old war about whether or not it

05:19.200 --> 05:28.240
is better to be respectable and incremental versus wild wiggy out there and to take the

05:28.240 --> 05:35.680
hit to one's reputation. That seems like a very poor choice of activities in which to

05:35.680 --> 05:44.080
spend our energy. A real problem, which is that since the 1970s, we haven't had theory-led

05:44.080 --> 05:48.480
breakthroughs in fundamental physics that would take anyone to Stockholm as a crude measure.

05:50.160 --> 06:02.240
But nobody knows what to do, the fact that we're coming up on 50 years of being lost in the

06:02.240 --> 06:09.360
wilderness in some sense. And some people choose to deny it. They say supersymmetry, guts,

06:10.080 --> 06:16.000
and strings and theory loop on gravity are all promising. One should just calibrate one's

06:16.000 --> 06:19.360
expectations. Other people are saying, what the hell are you talking about? We've never

06:19.360 --> 06:25.360
been in a situation this dire. I do want to push back just slightly on that, Eric, because I did

06:25.360 --> 06:33.040
consult with a friend who is a colleague here at UCSD for just a partial list. This was done in

06:33.040 --> 06:36.480
response to Peter White, who I know is a friend of yours and Sabine Haasenthaler.

06:37.280 --> 06:42.640
They're kind of claims, again, similar to what you're saying in the lack of the dearth of progress

06:43.200 --> 06:48.960
in the last four decades. And here's an incomplete list that I got back when I asked,

06:48.960 --> 06:53.440
what are some of the theoretical-led, driven, fundamental physics breakthroughs? Here's a list,

06:53.440 --> 06:58.880
incomplete list, thermodynamics of information, quantum computing, inflation, conformal field

06:58.880 --> 07:03.040
theory in two dimensions, conformal field theory in greater than two dimensions, modern,

07:03.040 --> 07:10.960
effective field theory, heavy quarks, binary black holes, superconductivity, and then cosmology.

07:10.960 --> 07:15.600
Again, we can sort of debate. I don't even think these are the most impressive things,

07:15.600 --> 07:22.240
necessarily. I would have said that the theory of the determinant line bundle and the Quillen

07:22.240 --> 07:31.200
connection, geometric quantization, the rigorous founding of quantum field theory around issues

07:31.200 --> 07:39.440
of enhanced boredism. No, I didn't think that was a good list. So it's not, I don't mean to be rude,

07:39.440 --> 07:45.840
but I'm not trying to make this stupid kill shot here against the community. I'm trying

07:45.840 --> 07:51.440
that the community is fundamentally dishonest. It's a dishonest community now.

07:51.440 --> 07:57.440
It lies about its achievements. It lies about its failures. So I think that what I'm doing is I'm

07:57.440 --> 08:03.600
giving it its due. I'm saying that I don't think guts are dead, grand unified theories.

08:03.600 --> 08:09.120
I don't even think supersymmetry is dead. I think that the field doesn't know how to explain

08:09.200 --> 08:13.760
itself. The field doesn't know how to defend itself. It lashes out at anybody who dares to

08:13.760 --> 08:21.520
contradict the official narrative, and it's enough. I mean, we're just all sick to death of listening

08:21.520 --> 08:25.920
to David Gross and Ed Whitten tell us what's what because we don't believe them.

08:26.960 --> 08:30.160
Well, I think there's this, you know, and you've spoken about this, you have,

08:30.880 --> 08:37.440
you know, sort of a Nobel worthy level of pithy three-letter acronyms, some even more famous than

08:37.440 --> 08:43.440
others. But one of them that I do cotton to is this idea of the gated institutional narrative.

08:43.440 --> 08:47.760
And I saw this on display and, you know, again, we can edit out anything you don't like. But,

08:48.480 --> 08:53.440
but, you know, there were people that that as soon as you posted your, I think, you know,

08:53.440 --> 08:59.360
it was maybe provocative to post it on April Fool's Day. But but nevertheless, it was reacted to with

08:59.360 --> 09:05.600
with great almost vitriol bordering, at least in some corners of the internet on almost like ad

09:05.600 --> 09:10.960
hominem level attacks. And I experienced the same thing when I interviewed Steven Wolfram.

09:10.960 --> 09:15.520
And I asked people, you know, do you not think these folks deserve a voice? I mean,

09:15.520 --> 09:21.840
you cannot claim that Steven is not a brilliant mind. You may think he is arrogant or that he,

09:21.840 --> 09:27.760
you know, tends to be self promotional, etc, etc. And even people were criticizing me for not asking

09:27.760 --> 09:33.600
him about his employee relations. And I said, look, I'm not 60 minutes. I'm going to interview him.

09:33.600 --> 09:38.000
I'm going to be respectful as I always am. I'm going to hear both sides. And if you don't like

09:38.000 --> 09:43.040
it, you know, I'll give you your money back on the internet for the subscription costs. But I feel,

09:43.040 --> 09:46.880
I want to know. And again, we don't have to talk about anything you don't feel like talking about.

09:46.880 --> 09:52.160
But I feel like this narrative that is being proposed is sort of part of this like the first

09:52.160 --> 09:56.480
reaction, which I think is a sign of sloppy thinking is I'll believe it when it's published.

09:56.480 --> 10:03.920
Now, I've heard people say that about the most extravagantly, you know, hyperbolic claims. I've

10:03.920 --> 10:09.680
heard people say that about ordinary claims. And it's sort of become a canard, a shibboleth. And

10:09.680 --> 10:15.440
I wonder how you feel about that. I mean, after all, we're treating peer review as if a, it's

10:15.440 --> 10:21.040
sacrosanct handed down from, you know, God or Muhammad on the mountain. Or if you like, that

10:21.040 --> 10:27.120
it's been around in science as a useful vehicle. Of course, it has utility and can have utility.

10:27.120 --> 10:32.240
But what do you make of the veneration of peer review, which, which as Stephen Wolfram has said

10:33.040 --> 10:37.600
in connection to this, he said, I think it's corrupt. I think traditional route

10:37.600 --> 10:42.560
is a giant story of somewhat corrupt gaming. I think it's some sort of inevitable that happens

10:42.560 --> 10:47.440
with these very large systems. It's a pity. And I point out, you know, there wasn't peer review

10:47.520 --> 10:52.560
for Galileo. There wasn't peer review for much of Newton and wasn't peer review

10:52.560 --> 10:59.360
for Watson and Crick in 1953. That's right. So, but now I also get a similar level of,

10:59.360 --> 11:05.440
you know, criticism for people that who do say legitimately, well, you get a lot of emails from

11:05.440 --> 11:10.720
true cranks and true people that are seeking hyperbolic attention. So how do you manage the

11:10.720 --> 11:15.440
gated narrative with having some value? I always say the hardest thing is for somebody to strike

11:15.440 --> 11:19.840
a middle ground, not to be polarized. That's easy to be polarized. It's bogus. If it's not peer

11:19.840 --> 11:24.320
reviewed, it's corrupt if it is. How do you strike a middle ground? Is there a value in the middle

11:24.320 --> 11:31.040
ground? Oh, that's a lot. And these are important questions. If you really want to dig into it,

11:31.040 --> 11:37.680
I'd be game. Yeah, please do. All right. So first of all, Stephen Wolfram is breaking the rules

11:37.680 --> 11:41.040
and there's suspicion that he's breaking the rules because he doesn't have a theory of everything

11:41.040 --> 11:46.480
and he's advertising it as if he does using PR and he's using the weight of his name

11:47.520 --> 11:52.800
in part to make a splash. And a lot of people who feel that that is wrong to do, particularly as an

11:52.800 --> 11:58.720
individual, take exception to that. And one can easily understand why they would take exception

11:58.720 --> 12:06.720
to that because it's an end run around some kind of quality. Okay, so that is probably true.

12:07.680 --> 12:13.440
The other thing is that it complicates the life of a working physicist to hear constantly,

12:13.440 --> 12:19.920
you know, my friend has an uncle whose best friend thinks he solved the theory of everything

12:19.920 --> 12:27.200
and he has a perpetual motion machine to prove it. Will you come back to his house in Peoria

12:27.200 --> 12:32.880
and check it out? Nobody wants to lead a life like that. And I think that that's entirely

12:32.880 --> 12:38.480
understandable. So I think we have to sort of, first of all, just demonstrate that we're not

12:38.480 --> 12:44.320
confused about why people would have this in a working world. It wouldn't it be great to have

12:44.320 --> 12:50.400
a nifty little shibboleth and discount everything that came in. So if all the cranks, you know,

12:50.400 --> 12:56.800
used red crayon on napkins, and that's how they submit everything, then you have an idea of

12:56.880 --> 13:03.840
who's a whack job and who's actually down. All right, now you have a different problem,

13:03.840 --> 13:10.400
which is that you've got whack jobs inside of the leading institutions who have been part of

13:10.400 --> 13:15.520
whack job programs. And the whack job programs have whack job journalists inside of the whack job

13:16.720 --> 13:21.680
leading papers. So if I open up the science times for years, there were these breathless

13:21.680 --> 13:27.280
stories about how M Theory was going to give me better toast, clean my fingernails and give me

13:27.280 --> 13:33.120
the theory of everything in short order. What happened to that? Well, those are institutional

13:33.120 --> 13:39.280
canarks. And the problem is that the canarks really dislike the cranks. And the cranks are

13:39.280 --> 13:46.080
trying to avoid the canarks. Now, first of all, you should know that I am not aware of the vitriol

13:46.080 --> 13:50.560
that you're talking about from the professional community aimed at me. I'm aware of it towards

13:50.560 --> 13:56.560
Stephen Wolfram. And I have been told that there are certain reddits that got shut down,

13:57.840 --> 14:04.800
very personal, very unpleasant. And first of all, you have to remember that the field has a lot to

14:04.800 --> 14:12.960
be embarrassed about. I've published essays in edge.org, critical of the String M Theory program,

14:12.960 --> 14:16.720
particularly some of the nastiest things that they have ever done. I mean, it's just, it's so

14:16.720 --> 14:23.120
bad, it is funny. One of the things, I forget whether David, whether Joe Polchinski maybe was

14:23.120 --> 14:28.800
credited with this, but there was the claim that if anybody comes up with anything that isn't

14:28.800 --> 14:32.880
String Theory, we'll just incorporate it into the String Theory program and say it is. So it's

14:32.880 --> 14:37.760
like, oh, wow, does that have the locals play? Great to know. You know, there's this sort of,

14:38.560 --> 14:42.960
when nobody's got a theory of quantum gravity, you have loop quantum gravity and String Theory

14:42.960 --> 14:47.840
buying to be the leading non theory of non quantum gravity, because neither of them seem to work.

14:50.000 --> 14:56.880
All of this leads to complete disarray. And of course, all that people have to fight over is

14:56.880 --> 15:04.400
prestige that's left over, you know, from the feast that was served by Dirac and Einstein

15:04.400 --> 15:11.760
and company, Feynman. And now their descendants are chewing over the bones that were thrown in

15:11.760 --> 15:16.000
the scrap heap, and it's pretty slim pickets. So of course, people are going to be nasty.

15:16.560 --> 15:19.840
I think that you have to expect that they're going to be nasty. And I think that you also

15:19.840 --> 15:25.840
have to be sympathetic, which is that if you're slaving away on a tiny fragment of a long ago

15:25.840 --> 15:29.760
abandoned program, because that's what you did your dissertation, and then you happen to have

15:29.760 --> 15:36.000
an office somewhere in the dot edu ecosystem, you're pretty pissed off that a guy like Stephen

15:36.000 --> 15:42.240
Wolfer, who might be, you know, pulling around flying private, you know, is hiring his own

15:42.240 --> 15:49.280
armada PR agent, and creating a splash. So I think it's, I think envy, the invidious nature of this,

15:50.160 --> 15:55.040
the palpable sense of failure, the sense that he doesn't really have a theory of everything,

15:55.840 --> 16:02.240
etc. This animates people and it should animate people. And there are sensible questions like

16:02.240 --> 16:06.800
why is it that people who come from outside the community only work on the theory of everything?

16:06.800 --> 16:12.080
Why don't they work on adding a couple of extra digits of precision to some QCD calculator?

16:12.080 --> 16:16.160
Right. Or, you know, revisiting or trying to prove ultimate was wrong.

16:18.240 --> 16:23.760
Whatever. I mean, you know, it's always Einstein was wrong. And here's why I always feel like it's,

16:23.760 --> 16:26.640
you know, it's like Dungeons and Dragons, they think they're going to get, you know,

16:26.640 --> 16:30.800
Einstein sort of. It's so funny, because like the one thing that I really never want to do

16:31.520 --> 16:36.160
is I don't want to damage Einstein. I feel like we're so blessed that he came through this way,

16:36.160 --> 16:40.320
like the trying to go after him because you want to teams really perverse.

16:41.360 --> 16:46.800
So let's get into, you know, your approach to I want to make sure that we settle that because

16:46.800 --> 16:51.920
people are going to focus on on this segment if they focus on this at all. I've built a fairly

16:51.920 --> 16:59.600
large platform from talking about things other than physics predominant. And I'm not a physicist,

16:59.600 --> 17:03.280
you know, people always say physicist Eric Weiss and I almost always correct

17:04.560 --> 17:09.520
to be really quite good about saying, Hey, I'm not part of your professional game. I'm not

17:09.520 --> 17:17.120
taking your professional resources. I'm not dirty, pristine archive, hep, hep, ph,

17:19.360 --> 17:25.040
you know, preprint server. And they're still pissed off. They're still angry. And they're angry

17:25.040 --> 17:33.120
because of hubris. You know, it takes a ridiculous sense of self possession and delusion

17:33.840 --> 17:37.600
to think that you're going to make progress in the field that is probably the hardest field of

17:37.600 --> 17:44.480
human endeavor that's been stuck for the longest time on the hardest problem. So I'm weirdly sympathetic

17:44.480 --> 17:50.960
to these momsers. I don't know what you want to call them. They're very pleasant people.

17:51.840 --> 17:59.360
I wish that they would, you know, I don't know, weed is legal. They should probably smoke a joint

17:59.360 --> 18:03.440
chill out and actually think about whether this really represents where they want to be in their

18:03.440 --> 18:08.960
lives, shouting at people after such a dearth of results or decades. Well, you know, my tag line

18:08.960 --> 18:12.880
is always, you know, I love astronomy. I love physics because it's not like in astronomy,

18:12.880 --> 18:17.280
there's a Republican constellation over there and there's a democratic comment over there. It

18:17.280 --> 18:23.200
should be like a political free zone and not necessarily a safe space where, you know, ideas

18:23.200 --> 18:27.840
can't be challenged. And, you know, part of what I respect about people like you, like Wolfram,

18:27.840 --> 18:32.400
is that you're willing to come on and, you know, I'm not a pushover to just accept everything

18:33.040 --> 18:37.840
that he or you would have to say. And yet I feel like it's extremely valuable. And I'm not just,

18:37.840 --> 18:42.880
I would say this about anybody who's, of course, you have to get over some gate to use the Weinsteinian

18:43.760 --> 18:48.000
expression. But at the same time, because there's only so much time in the day, let's be honest,

18:48.000 --> 18:53.600
I only have so much time to do the actual work I get paid to do by the state of California and

18:53.600 --> 18:59.440
also explore other things and do other projects. I think, A, there is a jealousy, there is a sense

18:59.440 --> 19:05.280
of jealousy. But B, I do think there is validity to people that say, look, these people are bypassing

19:05.280 --> 19:13.760
our traditional, time-tested modalities of going at and attacking scientific, scientific nature.

19:13.760 --> 19:20.640
And, and then this guy who's very eloquent and very deep goes on Joe Rogan and he just blasts away

19:20.640 --> 19:26.640
and he'll get more attention, you know, than the exponent of my H index. And I think that, that

19:27.200 --> 19:30.880
there is a balance there. I can love to take this issue with that if you don't mind.

19:30.880 --> 19:35.600
Yeah, let's go for it. Let's talk, the H index, by the way, originates here at UCSD by my colleague

19:35.600 --> 19:41.040
Jorge Hirsch. And I tease him about that because his highest cited paper is actually about the H

19:41.040 --> 19:44.640
index. And I hope to have him on the podcast that sometimes talk about attribution and credit.

19:44.640 --> 19:48.800
First of all, one of the things that's interesting about the H index, if you think about it,

19:48.800 --> 19:52.800
maybe you could apply it to Curt Goodell or somebody who published nothing.

19:52.800 --> 19:54.240
Right, yeah, exactly.

19:54.240 --> 20:02.400
Right. And so I partially have an aspiration if I'm going to have any impact on physics whatsoever,

20:02.400 --> 20:07.760
God willing, I would love to do it with like an H index of zero or undefined in order to

20:07.760 --> 20:13.280
destroy the H index because it's a proxy and people get very carried away with showing you

20:13.280 --> 20:18.640
how much hard work they've done in a cargo cult that the general is nonproductive. So

20:19.520 --> 20:25.600
it's a pretty bad proxy when it becomes circular. With respect to Joe Rogan, first of all,

20:26.880 --> 20:33.440
your community has a huge problem. I can't tell you how bored most of us are hearing about the

20:33.440 --> 20:37.840
multiverse or many worlds or entanglement. We're going to talk about all those, by the way,

20:37.840 --> 20:41.920
but go ahead. Double slit experiment. It's not that they're not interesting. It's not that they're

20:41.920 --> 20:45.600
not fascinating. It's not that they're not confusing and perplexing and deep and all these

20:45.600 --> 20:52.480
things, but we've heard it 12,000 times before. And whether Sean Carroll has a new wrinkle on the

20:52.480 --> 20:59.600
multiverse or not is irrelevant. The part of the problem is that you guys haven't even pushed out

20:59.600 --> 21:05.440
the Dirac equation. People really know who Dirac is. They don't really know how to spell the word

21:05.440 --> 21:12.960
spinner. They don't understand the hop vibration can be visualized. So with all due respect to

21:12.960 --> 21:18.800
the community, you failed. You guys have just, you're terrible. And when I think there's something

21:18.800 --> 21:26.480
sexy, actually, I want to go on Joe Rogan and I push out the hop vibration. Even if I don't

21:26.480 --> 21:32.240
explain it, if I just show people, here is a principle fiber bond. This is the kind of object

21:32.240 --> 21:40.720
on which gauge is taking. I've got artists all over the world trying to depict the basic structure

21:40.720 --> 21:46.720
so that people can see rather than Lawrence Krauss going on Joe Rogan and giving some analogy that

21:46.720 --> 21:52.160
is supposed to be about what gauge theory is. I'm trying to go on Joe Rogan and say, look, you know,

21:52.160 --> 22:01.520
the Penrose stairs, what if that is actually the depiction of horizontal subspaces defining a

22:01.520 --> 22:07.520
connection in some sense and what you're looking at is hollownam. I'm starting to get the right words

22:07.520 --> 22:12.800
into the hands of dangerous children of the internet who may not have access to Princeton,

22:12.800 --> 22:17.600
Stanford, or Harvard, or MIT, or Oxford, or Cambridge. No, I think that is valuable.

22:18.640 --> 22:22.560
But like with a little bit of self-righteous self-judication,

22:24.160 --> 22:30.880
match me. Instead of coming on and one more time telling me the same sort of mind-numbing stuff

22:31.440 --> 22:39.600
that the article seems to go through both slits. Really? It's a way, dammit. Can you please just

22:39.600 --> 22:46.160
explain this thing properly? Just get to the point where you're talking about her mission

22:46.160 --> 22:50.960
operators and eigenvectors and eigenvalues rather than all this mumbo jumbo speak. And if you don't

22:50.960 --> 22:54.720
mind, yes, I'm going to show them pictures that they've never seen before that you should have

22:54.720 --> 22:59.440
been showing them. And so the fact that you didn't do your job, don't come after me blaming me.

23:00.160 --> 23:05.680
Join me, beat me. Yeah, I think that that's some of the most valuable service. I know it's not

23:05.680 --> 23:09.760
necessarily intentional. Maybe it is. I mean, knowing you, it could be intentional. That

23:09.760 --> 23:15.360
controversy sheds sometimes too much heat, but it does bring light to these obscure topics. And

23:15.360 --> 23:21.120
other guests that I've had on, and Joe always takes the best of my guests. I've had on Sean Carroll,

23:21.120 --> 23:26.880
I've had on Stephen Wolfram, and I've had on Roger Penrose, and I know you've had on him as well.

23:26.960 --> 23:31.360
And he's another person. And it's like, you know, what do you have to say about him? Of course,

23:31.360 --> 23:36.080
he doesn't go on Joe Rogan for a time. The guy's 82 or something years old. He's not going there to

23:36.080 --> 23:40.800
bolster his social, you know, his social hits. He's going on there because he's passionately curious

23:40.800 --> 23:47.840
about extrapolating from the ivory tower where we both inhabit, although I believe less so in the

23:47.840 --> 23:52.960
case of an experimentalist. And I do want to get to that. But he is, you know, bringing to mind

23:52.960 --> 23:59.200
the same concept, Escher's, you know, infinite hyperbolic space projection, things that, yeah,

23:59.200 --> 24:04.640
what if there is some young kid who instead of being who, let's just say she can have the choice,

24:04.640 --> 24:08.720
she can look at the double slit experiment. That's wonderful. But yeah, what about looking at

24:08.720 --> 24:13.680
projective, you know, spaces? What about these conformal transformations? I think there is,

24:13.680 --> 24:19.040
and that he was the first science writer that I ever read popular science writer as a 17 or 18

24:19.040 --> 24:22.960
year old. I didn't understand much of what he was saying. And if there was a Joe Rogan back then,

24:22.960 --> 24:26.560
maybe it would have turned me on even more. And maybe I would have, you know, had a better career

24:26.560 --> 24:31.280
as a theorist, although I doubt it. Maybe, but you know, I guess what my take is going to be is that

24:31.280 --> 24:35.520
if I'm talking about the Wu Yang dictionary, and most physicists don't even think about the Wu

24:35.520 --> 24:41.040
Yang dictionary, and these are the pivotal moments in your life, you know, I'm not taking a ton of

24:41.040 --> 24:45.440
flack for saying wrong things. Sometimes people say, well, that wasn't a complete explanation.

24:45.440 --> 24:50.960
Well, no kidding. You know, my last one went out to, I think it's now at 6.1 million people.

24:50.960 --> 24:56.480
I mean, even for Joe Rogan, that's pretty large. Yeah, I think it is principal bundles out at scale,

24:56.480 --> 25:01.520
so that I'm accosted in airports. What with people saying, I didn't understand there's,

25:01.520 --> 25:07.680
there's a, there's a U1 vibration and an SU vibration. You're damn straight. I'm doing your PR

25:07.680 --> 25:12.240
for you. You guys can't even figure out how to get enough dollars into your field to keep you

25:12.240 --> 25:18.400
guys solvent. And despite the fact that I'm huge critic, I'm a huge critic of how you guys run your

25:18.400 --> 25:22.480
shop, you don't mind. I'm going to try to get you some funding, some visibility, and I'd appreciate

25:22.480 --> 25:27.680
it. Shut up. Thanks. Yeah, I think there is a lot of validity to that, Eric. I feel the same way

25:27.680 --> 25:31.680
about Wolfram, and it would be interesting to get your, have Wolfram on your show at some point,

25:31.680 --> 25:35.760
because I think, you know, these, or maybe I could host both of you at the same time,

25:35.760 --> 25:40.880
because I think there is a value in, and I see a parallel between what he does and what you do,

25:40.960 --> 25:45.600
and in your life's mission, at least in the geometric unity project. And it comes down to,

25:45.600 --> 25:50.320
you know, kind of this classic description of what, you know, I think Einstein or somebody else

25:50.320 --> 25:56.560
used to say is, is like wood and marble, you know, the kind of operational, quantized, you know,

25:56.560 --> 26:01.840
computational world of physics and the pure geometric, you know, irreducible fundamental

26:01.840 --> 26:07.280
side of the wood and marble, the wood is, is the stress energy tensor. Yes. But I would say,

26:07.280 --> 26:12.160
actually, it's steel, because it should be manmade or human made, right? It shouldn't be wood as

26:12.160 --> 26:16.800
naturally occurring and marbles naturally. I don't speak German, the original quote is in German,

26:16.800 --> 26:23.520
and I think it's cheap wood, and sometimes it's even translated as balsa. I think it is. My concern

26:23.520 --> 26:29.040
is that the real problem, of course, is in the marble, assume that the problem is in the wood.

26:29.040 --> 26:34.800
Yeah. So let's, let's turn to that now. Just today, I heard a wonderful, read a wonderful piece,

26:34.800 --> 26:39.120
not that I agree with it necessarily, but in Quanta Magazine, which is doing wonderful kind of

26:39.120 --> 26:46.880
popularization of very complex mathematical and technical, you know, cosmological, etc.,

26:46.880 --> 26:51.360
the hottest topics sort of in the field and has great writers to boot. And there's a piece today

26:51.920 --> 26:58.720
that says what goes on inside of a proton. The quark math is still in conflict with experiments,

26:58.720 --> 27:03.120
and they go through and they show, you know, these beautiful animations of a quark glue on plasma,

27:03.120 --> 27:07.040
and they talk about this million-dollar math prize awaits anyone who can solve this type of

27:07.040 --> 27:13.600
equation using QCD to show how massive entities like protons form. And I'm thinking like what

27:13.600 --> 27:17.120
percentage of people are going to understand it, even in the physics community, as you point out,

27:17.840 --> 27:22.400
I'm, I'm a physicist. Or in the math community. That's a part of the math gap, right? Luckily,

27:22.400 --> 27:27.680
for me, I had Robert Brandenburger and Jerry Garelnik as, you know, cosmology and group theory

27:27.680 --> 27:32.880
teachers. And I learned a great deal from them and from my colleague, Stefan Alexander,

27:32.880 --> 27:37.760
I mean, your mutual friend, who is incredibly creative and productive. Otherwise, I wouldn't

27:37.760 --> 27:42.480
have learned about it. I mean, I can go, I went basically my whole education without being required

27:42.480 --> 27:46.320
to learn about group theory. And arguably, does it come into play when I'm building a microwave

27:46.320 --> 27:51.680
radiometer for use at 17,000 feet above sea level? No, it doesn't. But at the same time,

27:51.680 --> 27:56.080
it's the reason I got into physics in the first place. And so what I want to kind of just

27:56.640 --> 28:01.520
toss around with you is on the experimental side, because I think we see things, you know,

28:01.520 --> 28:05.760
hammer theory, we see everything like it's our own personal hammer, you're obviously coming

28:05.760 --> 28:11.280
mathematically. But it gives you great visibility into, you know, I always say like, if I go like

28:11.280 --> 28:15.120
this, you know, I have a problem, but I don't know, I have a problem. I'm covering my eye for

28:15.120 --> 28:20.320
people that are listening on the on the audio version of the podcast. And I think getting a

28:20.320 --> 28:25.680
perspective from outside, there are things that really hit a nerve when we talk about things,

28:25.680 --> 28:31.040
especially things that may be untestable. And, and for example, the multiverse, I personally

28:31.040 --> 28:35.440
have a lot of issues with the multiverse. And I know people celebrate, I actually asked Sean

28:35.440 --> 28:39.600
Carroll, this branch, you have a lot of issues. Yeah, exactly. Right. I asked Sean Carroll,

28:39.600 --> 28:43.920
you know, what would you say is the, you know, is the likelihood that the multiverse is true?

28:43.920 --> 28:49.280
And he said 50%. And I asked him, well, what's the likelihood that God is true? He said less than

28:49.280 --> 28:54.640
1%. He wouldn't say zero. He's, he's, he's certainly, you know, very, very knowledgeable

28:54.640 --> 28:59.840
about how to ascribe his, his priors. But on the other hand, I think, yes, when you get into

28:59.840 --> 29:03.680
these descriptions, of course, it's not, and I don't want to go through geometric unity,

29:03.680 --> 29:10.240
except to ask you if we can post the PowerPoint in the show notes that you showed after your

29:10.240 --> 29:15.120
April Fool's Day podcast, because I think, you know, people are leaping and saying, well,

29:15.120 --> 29:20.560
you know, in 2013, you promised there was an archive paper coming and, you know, I look for

29:20.560 --> 29:26.160
it. I don't see it. But would it be possible to post the PowerPoint that you use just for the

29:26.160 --> 29:29.200
people? Because I don't want to go through it. You've gone through it with Joe. You've gone through

29:29.200 --> 29:35.680
with Lex Friedman. But first of all, I mean, you can screenshot the PowerPoint. I can come up with

29:35.680 --> 29:44.240
the PowerPoint. I get very innervated by this talk. Community is really badly behaved. And my

29:44.240 --> 29:49.440
feeling is you don't really, I don't think you really care that much about the PowerPoint. Most

29:49.440 --> 29:53.120
people in the community who have this kind of like paper or didn't happen, this kind of attitude.

29:55.200 --> 30:00.000
This is shorthand for please just, just say a Lagrangian so we can go through it and invalidate

30:00.000 --> 30:07.040
you. That's really the energy. The gain of institutional Lagrangian. Well, no. The point

30:07.040 --> 30:14.160
being that a Lagrangian is a very clear and clean way of saying what a theory is. And there's

30:14.160 --> 30:18.080
a fascination in the community, which is, well, if you think you've got this whole thing, why don't

30:18.080 --> 30:25.040
you put your pen down and tell us what it is? And I'm not even necessarily that scared of that.

30:25.040 --> 30:30.160
That's not the issue. The issue is you guys just aren't honest about where you're really at. You're

30:30.160 --> 30:35.440
irritated. You're pissed off. And you're pissed off partially at me, but you're pissed off largely

30:35.440 --> 30:41.040
at yourselves. And everybody knows it. And one of the reasons that I don't have a ton of fear

30:41.120 --> 30:47.840
is that I don't have somebody else regulating my oxygen in the community.

30:47.840 --> 30:57.280
So the issue of what a theory is, how to milk it for information, a lot of this was dealt with very

30:58.000 --> 31:05.120
well in Duroc's 1963 Scientific American article, deserves to be very widely read, even though

31:05.840 --> 31:13.520
our audience, he's somewhat used Schrodinger as his stocking horse, where he talked about

31:13.520 --> 31:22.800
Schrodinger's failure to agree with experiment. And the issue is that apparently the Schrodinger

31:22.800 --> 31:27.760
hadn't taken into consideration certain aspects of spin. So this has to do with what I would call

31:27.760 --> 31:37.440
the suitmaker and the tailor. If you have a kind of a weird way of paying for things,

31:37.440 --> 31:42.080
where whoever discovers the island doesn't get the island named after them, but whoever

31:42.080 --> 31:47.440
climbs to the top of the highest summit on the island and puts a flag there, that's the name

31:47.440 --> 31:53.600
of the island. So the guy who's spending his time tying up the boat at the dock gets beaten

31:53.600 --> 31:57.760
by the guy who races to the summit. Okay, well, that's a pretty innervating thing, or like you

31:57.760 --> 32:03.200
pay for the last leg of the relay different than who did the best time in the relay race.

32:03.200 --> 32:07.200
You saw this with, for example, the Poincare conjecture in mathematics,

32:07.200 --> 32:13.040
where somebody's building on several large steps, but it's a pro-man solution to the conjecture.

32:13.040 --> 32:18.480
So you've got all these sort of issues of the political economy of physics and mathematics,

32:19.280 --> 32:27.200
and, you know, this is what causes people to get really pissed off, because Dorak's point was

32:27.200 --> 32:33.360
Schrodinger came up with the suit, but until the tailoring is done, you don't know whether it fits

32:33.360 --> 32:39.200
the patient, which is experiment or, you know, the client. And so this is sort of the problem,

32:39.200 --> 32:44.160
which is why do you want to deliver a suit to somebody who's going to claim that the tailor

32:44.160 --> 32:50.000
made the suit when they do the last alteration? And I think that this is part of the problem with

32:50.000 --> 32:56.320
copper, at least the naive application of copper, and people have to realize there's a price for

32:56.320 --> 33:04.640
playing all of these incredibly innervating games with credit and pretending that nobody cares about

33:04.640 --> 33:10.480
credit and that everybody behind the scene stabs each other. Being outside of the system, I've

33:10.480 --> 33:15.200
never seen such a group of completely hypocritical people who all seem to only want to serve nature,

33:15.200 --> 33:20.400
God, and Jesus, but on the other hand, what they really seem to do is behind the scenes demand

33:20.400 --> 33:25.920
that they get proper credit, proper citations. You know, and just another quick point.

33:27.440 --> 33:33.600
When Juan Maldesena won his breakthrough prize, he had to explain what he'd been up to, and he

33:33.600 --> 33:38.560
was talking about gauge theory, and he had to illustrate it, and he chose to illustrate it

33:38.560 --> 33:43.200
with the economics of exchange rates, which actually came out of work that my wife did at

33:43.200 --> 33:49.520
Harvard. It happened that he didn't credit my wife's dissertation where some of this work appeared.

33:49.520 --> 33:54.880
He knew about the, you know, and when I ran into him in San Francisco, he changed that. He also

33:54.880 --> 34:01.360
diluted this a little bit by quoting some irrelevant work. So, you know, my feeling about this is

34:01.360 --> 34:06.320
the community also has a huge problem not acknowledging people that it doesn't think are

34:06.320 --> 34:10.960
going to show up at the next conference. You sort of know who all the regulars are, and you play with

34:10.960 --> 34:17.520
them using the game theory. So, you would attribute outside of the community. Very often, the citation

34:17.520 --> 34:21.760
games don't work. The credit games don't work because we don't have a credible threat. And one

34:21.760 --> 34:28.000
of the nice things about having a relatively large podcast and access to some of the largest

34:28.000 --> 34:34.160
platforms in the world is the community hasn't really quite figured out that you're not necessarily

34:34.160 --> 34:39.600
going to see me at your conference if you don't invite me. But if you don't credit my work and

34:39.600 --> 34:44.560
you start to, you know, talk about it, you are going to have a problem with repeated games. I

34:44.560 --> 34:49.520
think the academic game works best when you have repeated games. And part of the problem with why

34:49.520 --> 34:55.200
people take on cranky affectations when they don't start off as cranks is that they come to understand

34:55.200 --> 34:59.680
that the system doesn't work as advertised. But if you want to get into the substance of what these

34:59.680 --> 35:04.080
theories are, that would be fun too, not just talking around them, but talking about.

35:04.960 --> 35:08.080
Yeah, I do want to talk about that. But just to circle back, you know, I mean,

35:09.040 --> 35:15.120
you, it seems to be common for, you know, one of two different approaches. You can attribute

35:15.120 --> 35:20.800
malice or incompetence. Now, it's hard to believe that, you know, Juan would be incompetent because

35:20.800 --> 35:25.200
he is brilliant. So I guess, you know, if that's your only alternative to attribute something

35:25.200 --> 35:31.520
malicious, that is, you know, that that's certainly your right. It's, it's a, it's a behavior pattern.

35:32.560 --> 35:41.360
Look, I love Isadora Singer, who's been a dear friend of mine in the past. But he would forget

35:41.360 --> 35:46.880
when he heard something from me, because I wasn't somehow properly in the right place in his

35:46.880 --> 35:52.560
consciousness. We see this with women very often in meetings where they'll say something five minutes

35:52.640 --> 35:57.760
later, a man will say more or less the same thing and everybody will say, ah, Jim's done it again.

35:58.640 --> 36:06.080
Right. Matilda effect. Right. Call this he peating. Right. There's something called the Matthew effect

36:06.080 --> 36:13.040
to hit. Matilda effect. Right. Yeah. And then there's the Matilda effect. So all of these things

36:13.040 --> 36:18.880
have to do with the way in which our social brains compute how we wish to be diluted going

36:18.880 --> 36:24.320
forward, who we wish to acknowledge. And we make an implicit calculation. Am I likely to see this

36:24.320 --> 36:31.680
person tomorrow or not? Right. Yeah, I do look at it. I'm just here to remind people. It got more

36:31.680 --> 36:39.600
expensive. Certainly, it is true that, that you have a prominence, which I think is unquestionably

36:39.600 --> 36:45.920
earned that you've, you have developed a personality and a unique modality of thinking. You're also

36:45.920 --> 36:50.880
incredibly courageous, which is one of the rarest of all traits. I don't think you really give

36:51.520 --> 36:58.320
a figure, I'll say, because it's a PG conversation. On the other hand, I look at you and I see

36:59.360 --> 37:04.560
these kind of a different image of a lot of my colleagues who are very dear. They kind of remind

37:04.560 --> 37:09.200
me of these fiddler crabs that you see at the beach here in San Diego. They're incredibly well

37:09.200 --> 37:14.400
developed on one side of their shell. And the other side is this puny little digit. But you

37:14.400 --> 37:19.440
don't see them going around, you know, and kind of like berating the other crabs that have two

37:19.440 --> 37:26.000
equally sized, you know, protuberances or whatever you call claws. And that it's kind of, it's puzzling

37:26.000 --> 37:30.560
to me, because you see it for people like Mildegras Tyson, who is not, you know, an active scientist

37:30.560 --> 37:35.760
or Bill Nye, who is an engineer by training, and they're outstanding communicators. And yet,

37:35.760 --> 37:41.120
there's some of the largest targets of jealousy. It just seems strange. It's like me criticizing

37:41.760 --> 37:45.760
the conductor of an orchestra for being, you know, getting attention during this.

37:47.280 --> 37:55.360
Let me take my opponent's view as steel-mannered slightly. In part, it has to do with how much

37:55.360 --> 38:00.880
deference and fairness these people give to the community that they are implicitly mining. So I

38:00.880 --> 38:05.120
think everybody knows that they in some sense benefit from Mildegras Tyson's popularity.

38:05.680 --> 38:10.080
You know, Brian Green is potentially kind of a more interesting version of this because

38:11.760 --> 38:16.000
he's got great comic timing. Oh boy, that guy would have been fantastic in Vaudeville.

38:16.560 --> 38:22.080
On the other hand, he's a straight up geometric gangster, you know, he can hang with the best of

38:22.080 --> 38:29.680
them. I think that in the case of Bill Nye, the sort of the sense is, how did a guy with a bow tie

38:29.680 --> 38:34.400
come to speak for the rest of us who are doing research? And so I think that there's, there are

38:34.400 --> 38:39.760
healthy tension. I think one of the points that I keep trying to make is I'm not speaking

38:40.640 --> 38:46.640
for the community as their voice. Like I may be pissed, but I also think, you know, I think I've

38:46.640 --> 38:51.200
been very clear that the theoretical physics community is the intellectual version of SEAL Team

38:51.200 --> 38:56.720
6 and our underfunding of theoretical physics is a tragedy. And it's in part what causes the

38:56.720 --> 39:03.200
community to be unspeakably beastly to, to not only each other, but to outsiders.

39:03.600 --> 39:08.400
Right. They're fighting over the crimes of the scrums of this cookie that's shriveling up.

39:08.400 --> 39:13.040
Well, you guys need more money. You've struck the world's worst licensing deal. Somebody's

39:13.040 --> 39:17.360
got to defend the theoretical physics community because you're not allowed to license what you've

39:17.360 --> 39:22.880
contributed to the world. And therefore you can't, you know, if everybody had to pay for every

39:22.880 --> 39:30.160
semiconductor instruction or every URL, every email ever sent, or every, every, all the protection

39:30.160 --> 39:34.880
that came from the hydrogen bombs and lives that were saved to America by being able to end

39:34.880 --> 39:41.360
whatever it is. It's enormous. It's enormous. The theoretical physics community should never

39:41.360 --> 39:46.640
have to beg for another dime. But they should. The ought from is though, Eric, how do you actually,

39:46.640 --> 39:51.680
what are you going to, are we going to apply a tax point? You call them taxpayer dollars. I'm not

39:51.680 --> 39:57.120
a physicist. Those are $5 for the most part, the extent to which the modern economy is built on

39:57.200 --> 40:03.520
physics, whether it's communications or computation or protection or chemistry or whatever.

40:04.560 --> 40:11.520
Let's be clear. They're physics dollars. And we had a licensing deal and you guys

40:11.520 --> 40:17.600
welched, you, the general public welched, taxpayer welched, don't bug me about your taxpayer dollars.

40:17.600 --> 40:22.800
You guys are the beneficiaries of the best deal in history. Shut up, fund the theoretical physics

40:23.360 --> 40:27.760
community. Yes, they're horrible. Yes, they're failing. Not doing their job. Yes, they're lying

40:27.760 --> 40:33.040
to you. Start paying them. They will be much better. They'll still not be perfect. They're arrogant

40:33.040 --> 40:38.400
because they're the reason for the arrogance. I don't hear anyone else saying anything remotely

40:38.400 --> 40:43.920
like what I'm saying. And I try to be fair just like with Juan. I settled up our differences.

40:43.920 --> 40:48.480
I'm not saying that I'm pissed at him. I am saying that it's a very common behavior pattern. I've

40:48.480 --> 40:54.480
had the same issue with John Baez over the Actonians. Again, I can settle my differences,

40:54.480 --> 41:00.400
but I'm just telling you that from the outside, it's very strange that when I go to a gathering,

41:00.400 --> 41:06.480
I come in as a Harvard PhD. I'm treated one way, but if I come in as an employee of Peter Teal,

41:06.480 --> 41:11.920
I'm treated as the dumb money that has to be convinced that we should throw it at the community

41:11.920 --> 41:17.600
because community is doing the most mind blowing stuff of all time. When I start talking technically,

41:17.600 --> 41:21.680
you see people have this feeling like, wow, you're not supposed to be able to do that.

41:21.680 --> 41:25.360
Right. And then you go through this phase transition and break out the hop vibration.

41:25.360 --> 41:31.920
I want to ask you, does this not result naturally as the evolutionary culmination of what I call

41:31.920 --> 41:36.960
the academic hunger games? I mean, you start off and get into the best college. You need to do

41:36.960 --> 41:42.000
all sorts of activities and get good grades and take good tests and so forth. Then you go to

41:42.000 --> 41:45.440
college and you're competing in the physical sciences. Let's just say you're going to be a

41:45.440 --> 41:50.000
theoretical physicist. You're competing with some of the brightest minds who have ever lived in your

41:50.000 --> 41:56.000
peer group. You got to outlast them to get a good PhD slot. Then you got to shine as a PhD student,

41:56.000 --> 42:00.640
get the attention of your advisor. Then you got to get a good letter of recommendation and a job

42:00.640 --> 42:05.120
offer, a prestigious postdoc. Then you got to get a good, it's just a minor. It's gotten so much

42:05.120 --> 42:11.120
worse since 20 years ago when I went through the final rung in this ladder. Yeah, go ahead.

42:11.120 --> 42:16.400
We have to stop this. How do you stop it? How do you undo a 1,000-year-old tradition?

42:17.600 --> 42:21.920
This is not a 1,000-year-old tradition. This has to do with Vannevar Bush, the endless frontier,

42:21.920 --> 42:28.400
the expansion of the post-secondary education system. I think I was hanging out with the provost

42:28.400 --> 42:37.440
at UCSD and he didn't even understand the effect of the Eilberg Amendment of 1976 by Dole in 1980,

42:37.440 --> 42:45.520
the fraudulent NSF and NAS projections of a looming shortage that opened the floodgates

42:46.480 --> 42:52.240
foreign labor universities, the misclassification, the student apprenticeship. There's an entire

42:52.240 --> 42:59.600
recent horrible history of turning the modern professor into a surf, not just the graduate

42:59.680 --> 43:06.880
student into a surf, but attempt to destroy academic freedom. If you cannot tell people to

43:06.880 --> 43:12.160
screw off and know that you are still funded the next day and you can still come into your office,

43:12.160 --> 43:17.520
the field is lost. Yeah, but I mean, so I do want to talk about, let's just go there now,

43:17.520 --> 43:22.560
academic freedom. Is it still valuable? Is it still necessary? I make the claim that in my field

43:22.560 --> 43:27.680
in experimental physics, until COVID-19, which I do want to pick your brains on, until COVID-19,

43:27.680 --> 43:34.800
I had 100% employment rate for all my PhDs and my undergraduates. This 14 people as of yesterday

43:34.800 --> 43:41.520
have become a PhD, they've gone out to professorships, prestigious post-docs and so forth. So there's

43:41.520 --> 43:47.440
no gating up until that point that's certainly a seller's market, jobseeker's market up until this

43:47.440 --> 43:53.360
level. I don't know exactly in the same sense in the theoretical market, although I have very

43:53.360 --> 43:58.880
many friends, but they take fewer students and so it's a little bit normalized in that sense. But

43:58.880 --> 44:04.480
in terms of academia and freedom, I mean, I could say whatever I want, but I could also,

44:04.480 --> 44:09.040
even if I didn't have tenure, I could say, you know, I could say whatever I want also and go and

44:09.040 --> 44:14.640
get a job in industry or go and get a job in finance. Not to diminish it, not to diminish it,

44:14.640 --> 44:19.280
or sorry, just not to diminish it, but just saying that I have a valuable set of Liam Neeson-like

44:19.280 --> 44:25.280
skills that I convey to my students that are very flexible. And I know that's true of theorists as

44:25.280 --> 44:30.880
well. So to what extent does a professor of physics need to be tenured and guaranteed fiefdom for life

44:30.880 --> 44:37.040
arguing against my own interests? But you know, or let's go sociology. Very important. Yeah, go ahead.

44:37.040 --> 44:42.960
It's very important. This is the replacement of FU money. And it's not just about whether you have a

44:42.960 --> 44:48.480
job. There's all sorts of ways to turn up the heat on a professor. You can put them in a shitty

44:48.560 --> 44:53.680
office. You can give them a huge teaching load. You can humiliate them. There are all sorts of

44:53.680 --> 45:02.080
ways to fire people who can't be fired. So there's no joke. Unfortunately, I've lived long enough

45:02.080 --> 45:08.160
that it's no longer relevant, which is what's the difference between free speech under the Soviet

45:08.160 --> 45:15.120
and American Constitution? And the answer is that the Soviet Constitution gives you the right to

45:15.120 --> 45:19.360
say anything and protest your government, but the American Constitution guarantees your freedom

45:19.360 --> 45:28.320
the day after. So the key question is, can you tell your field to screw off and still get grants?

45:29.040 --> 45:35.520
That's a question. Can you tell your department chair that they're out of line trying to force

45:35.520 --> 45:43.680
you to sign a diversity and inclusion of which you should, you know, tremble reverently with your

45:43.680 --> 45:50.400
pen in hand to sign, know that when you don't sign, you're going to be fine. So I think that

45:50.400 --> 45:55.920
partially the problem is also that you cannot say that giving academic freedom to people who

45:55.920 --> 46:01.360
will never use it. If you overvet and you make sure that the people who get academic freedom are

46:01.360 --> 46:07.280
the people you can trust never to need it, that all of these things don't work. The key issue is

46:07.280 --> 46:13.920
you need dangerous, safe people. Dangerous by virtue of the fact that they can say everything

46:13.920 --> 46:18.480
that needs to be said safe and that they're not going to abuse it to say things that shouldn't

46:18.480 --> 46:23.520
and needn't be said. And if you can't have dangerous, safe people knowing that they're

46:23.520 --> 46:29.120
going to be fine the day after they said what needed to be said that pissed everybody off,

46:29.120 --> 46:32.240
but woke everybody up, then it's not academic freedom.

46:32.240 --> 46:38.000
Do you really feel like that could happen if I criticize Ed Whitten? Am I going to get my

46:38.640 --> 46:46.000
tenure shift or my teaching assignment at UCSD, you know, greatly enhanced, punished in that way?

46:46.800 --> 46:50.240
Well, I'm not saying that there's a direct transmission mechanism. I didn't know that

46:50.240 --> 46:56.160
you and Ed Whitten were in the same game. But I'll say that Ed Whitten is perhaps the finest,

46:56.160 --> 47:02.000
you know, mathematician of our time, but that his leadership of the theoretical

47:02.000 --> 47:08.400
physics community has been arguably disastrous and that he earned effectively as a

47:08.400 --> 47:15.280
geometer and spent as a string theorist. That's a very dangerous statement if I was in fact at,

47:15.280 --> 47:21.360
let's say, the Center for Theoretical Physics at MIT. And, you know, I feel about Ed Whitten the

47:21.360 --> 47:25.600
way people sometimes feel about Voldemort, which is that you want to be very carefully saying

47:25.600 --> 47:30.960
his name at this advanced age of my life. He's one of the few people that I find absolutely

47:30.960 --> 47:36.960
terrifying. And that's not politically, just intellectually. The neurons on that guy just,

47:37.680 --> 47:44.000
I've never seen anything like it. Yeah, I mean, just recently he came up with a way to test for a

47:44.000 --> 47:48.640
black hole in the outer solar system. So now he is venturing into my turf. He's, he's gotten into

47:48.640 --> 47:54.000
astrophysics. So I could be, I could theoretically be endangered, I suppose. Well, but I'm just

47:54.000 --> 47:59.440
trying to say that part of the problem was I didn't care people after David Gross, David Gross,

48:00.240 --> 48:06.240
who again, you know, fabulous physicist and one really the seminal figure to cross over

48:07.040 --> 48:13.360
from the, you know, last major improvements in the standard model into the world of strings and

48:13.360 --> 48:19.120
beyond. You know, he gave these talks year after year to sort of say where the theoretical physics

48:19.120 --> 48:24.400
community was going. And there wasn't enough ability to say, are we going over a cliff?

48:25.440 --> 48:29.040
Is this, is this crazy? Is this insane? I mean, what, what are we doing people?

48:29.840 --> 48:35.120
Like that voice was silenced because people were terrified. I would hear people say, well,

48:35.120 --> 48:38.720
I'm so glad you said something, but I could never say something. And I really disliked it.

48:39.920 --> 48:46.240
So I mean, what way of incentivizing is there a market, you know, mode of, of operating?

48:46.240 --> 48:50.560
Guys need more money. But I mean, I, I agree. I'm not going to turn down more money. And,

48:50.560 --> 48:54.480
you know, ever since the Phoenicians, no, no, it's super important that you guys have a guarantee

48:56.000 --> 49:02.720
universal physics income. Ralph, Ralph, Ralph Gomery of the Sloan Foundation said this thing to

49:02.720 --> 49:09.840
me. He said, the bargain was always that you weren't going to get super rich as a professor,

49:09.840 --> 49:16.720
but you would have the freedom that came from your job. And that's how we got great people.

49:16.720 --> 49:22.480
When we lost the freedom, we stopped being able to compete effectively for the top people.

49:23.040 --> 49:29.520
And so my version of this is you need the freedom of a billionaire without the wealth.

49:31.200 --> 49:36.160
We have had, you know, and this is a huge shift in science funding, arguably, I mean,

49:36.160 --> 49:39.840
the last, you know, 10 years has been some of the biggest struggles in

49:40.400 --> 49:45.440
my career to get funding from federal sources and some of the most successful to get it from

49:45.440 --> 49:50.000
private foundations, because I think there is sort of a freedom that comes with the private

49:50.000 --> 49:54.800
foundation. And yeah, you can talk about the FU capital that they can supply. But on the other

49:54.800 --> 50:00.000
hand, they also have priorities that may not align with the priorities of the entire nation,

50:00.000 --> 50:04.560
right? So, so I wonder, you know, if you're talking to, you know, somebody who like Jim

50:04.560 --> 50:09.440
Simons, who's been criticized for merely pursuing his own intellectual interests, I don't think

50:09.440 --> 50:13.920
that's fair. It's like a guy's working on a cure for autism, you know, by what standard?

50:13.920 --> 50:19.280
Jim Simons isn't all around fantastic. Yeah, he's a unique human being. A unique human being.

50:19.280 --> 50:27.280
But Jim Simons has the correct instincts. There's nothing more important, in my opinion,

50:27.920 --> 50:31.440
for the preservation of humanity than theoretical physics.

50:32.240 --> 50:39.360
Yeah, you think it's actually culturally relevant to the survival of a society? If so,

50:39.360 --> 50:43.360
how did we do without it, you know, until the 1940s or so in 1930s?

50:45.040 --> 50:49.760
Well, I don't agree with that. I mean, my feeling about this is, first of all, that

50:51.520 --> 50:56.480
it's necessary for the survival of humanity for a couple of different reasons, which have to be

50:56.480 --> 51:05.520
pulled apart. The first of which is theoretical physics is unique in the sense that it somehow

51:05.520 --> 51:14.320
trains the pure mental facility and the gritty mental facility to work together like nothing

51:14.320 --> 51:18.800
else we've ever discovered. I'm not saying it's not possible to duplicate it again,

51:19.440 --> 51:24.960
but even relative to mathematicians who I could make an argument might even be smarter in a certain

51:24.960 --> 51:33.040
kind of technical sense. The power of the hybrid vigor of pure cleanliness and pure grit

51:34.400 --> 51:39.760
produced something where we never knew that the human mind was capable of those flights,

51:39.760 --> 51:44.960
as we've seen in theoretical physics. So I really believe that if you wanted to talk about, you know,

51:44.960 --> 51:51.360
the gym that trains bodies to be at their peak, well, for the mind, that's theoretical physics,

51:51.360 --> 51:58.000
fundamental physics at best. It's a dojo. All right. It's the dojo. And the idea that you get,

51:58.000 --> 52:03.920
like, I'm going to say this the horrible way, if China was smart, they go and buy the Institute

52:03.920 --> 52:08.480
for Advanced Study. They just buy out all those guys. They're like, what, five guys who are just

52:08.480 --> 52:12.880
all of them unbelievable, whatever my issues are? I mean, people are like, I don't understand,

52:12.880 --> 52:16.800
are you for Ed Whitton? Are you against him? Well, I have a complicated relationship with

52:16.800 --> 52:22.720
these guys. Right. If I were China, I would pay each of those guys $10 million a year

52:23.920 --> 52:30.320
to have a deal. And the fact that we wouldn't bid that up is because we're idiots, right? So

52:31.760 --> 52:38.400
you want the world's smartest people happy and at your beck and call. And maybe you call them up

52:38.400 --> 52:45.120
once every 25 years. It's a bargain. Shut up. Pay it. It's their money anyway. There's two

52:45.200 --> 52:51.920
grandfathers and grandmothers created it. So if you look at it, and I agree with you that physics,

52:51.920 --> 52:57.120
I broaden it to experiment because I think the best experimental physicist should know

52:57.120 --> 53:01.200
the most about theory. Actually, we are encumbered. I was going to get to that. Yeah. Okay, go ahead.

53:01.200 --> 53:06.800
Take it away. So CERN is the most obvious, but then there are like high precision experiments.

53:06.800 --> 53:11.600
There's all the amazing stuff doing at the South Pole. There's the fact that LIGO can pick up these

53:11.600 --> 53:19.040
faint. There's an analog in the experimental end of this, which is look at what we've done.

53:19.040 --> 53:24.720
This is the reason that you put computers, you know, to their limits, engineering,

53:24.720 --> 53:31.040
tolerances, creativity. All of this stuff is hugely valuable any time you want to convert it to

53:31.040 --> 53:38.240
something else. But people want to do the sexiest stuff when they're not being tasked for practical

53:38.240 --> 53:43.280
stuff. The Manhattan Project was an engineering project. It wasn't really a theoretical physics

53:43.280 --> 53:48.320
project. It did have a positive effect. If you look at the Shelter Island conference,

53:48.320 --> 53:54.960
clearly these guys were not suffering from the same level of learned helplessness that the

53:54.960 --> 54:00.160
Dirac's quantum electrodynamics had induced before renormalization taught us how to extract

54:01.120 --> 54:09.120
measurable predictions. But in all of these things, the key issue is the first aspect of

54:09.120 --> 54:13.600
why you find theoretical physics is that you want to know that you can call up the world's smartest

54:13.600 --> 54:19.840
people whenever you need them to solve your analytic problems that have grit and indeterminacy

54:19.840 --> 54:24.320
in them. And there's an absolute parallel on the experimental side. The second thing

54:25.280 --> 54:32.560
is that we learned just over 100 years ago that we've got fundamental limitations on visiting

54:32.560 --> 54:39.040
rights to the universe. And I can't stand to constantly hear that Elon wants to go to Mars

54:39.040 --> 54:46.640
to save the world because the Mars, the moon, Titan, and Celadus. There's just not enough

54:46.640 --> 54:53.440
diversity locally to do any. And so we may be trapped here. It may be that whatever Einstein

54:53.520 --> 54:59.040
figured out, more or less, is unhackable. And that even when you move from effective theories

54:59.040 --> 55:06.960
to ultimate theories, it can be that there's nothing new to do. But right now, between 1952

55:06.960 --> 55:13.920
and 1954, you put the world on notice that we're going to blow ourselves up unless we have a

55:13.920 --> 55:20.880
wisdom explosion, which doesn't look like it. We got to get off this rock. And you've got to stop

55:20.960 --> 55:26.720
hearing that as science fiction or somebody who watched too many Star Wars movies.

55:28.400 --> 55:33.680
It's only going to take one device going off in a mid-level city as a demonstration of prowess

55:33.680 --> 55:37.360
to let people know that you can't always stop something because of the ballistic missile.

55:37.360 --> 55:46.160
You can't detect all of the enriched fissile material. Whatever we're in, theoretical physics

55:46.160 --> 55:51.600
changed the game with the hydrogen devices of the early 50s. And we are now in the adaptive

55:51.600 --> 55:57.840
valley and we're going to die here as a species. If we do not get out, the only group of people who

55:57.840 --> 56:02.720
can get us out are either the people who would upload us into silicon and forgive me, that sounds

56:02.720 --> 56:10.000
completely ridiculous to me, or the people who could find out whether or not when we pass from

56:10.000 --> 56:18.560
effective Einsteinian theory to ultimate theory, we are in fact limited. So to determine that,

56:18.560 --> 56:22.880
right, so I wanted to bring this up actually in a series of rapid fire questions at the end,

56:22.880 --> 56:28.800
where I'm just going to ask you to say yes or no if you have greater than 50% credulity and

56:28.800 --> 56:34.960
various items. You're asking a non-physicist. No, I know that, Eric, but you're a thinker and you

56:35.040 --> 56:40.480
know very much about risk and you know you're very well schooled in Bayesian reasoning and I think

56:40.480 --> 56:51.040
I'm just an internet personality. And podcaster, noted podcaster. So you look at the Drake equation

56:51.040 --> 56:56.400
and it was born right after, you know, World War II in 1961. You know, Frank Drake came up with this

56:56.400 --> 57:00.800
famous theory and actually most of the terms in that equation, it's not really an equation that

57:00.800 --> 57:06.400
would satisfy any mathematician of note, nor does it ever come along with concomitant error

57:06.400 --> 57:11.200
bars, error analyses, it's always just multiply these fractions together and you'll get a likelihood.

57:11.200 --> 57:15.600
But the one uncertainty that we haven't revealed, in other words, we know star formation rates of

57:15.600 --> 57:20.720
galaxies, we know the number of stars that have habitable zone like planets, we don't know L,

57:20.720 --> 57:25.280
the lifetime. And it sounds to me, and we had a conversation about this last week offline,

57:25.280 --> 57:30.480
you know, that you are actually very deeply, it's not, it's not just, you know, kind of a headline,

57:30.480 --> 57:35.360
you know, grabbing thing that you are very concerned. I don't know if you're a member of the,

57:35.360 --> 57:40.240
you know, atomic bulletin, whatever this union of atomic scientists, bulletin of atomic scientists,

57:40.240 --> 57:45.120
or if it's respectable, I'm not part of it. You would never join such a such a group. No,

57:45.120 --> 57:50.400
no, no, I would never be asked. I see. Okay. This one's run by your friend Lawrence Kraus. So I

57:50.400 --> 57:55.280
wonder if it could be. I've never met Lawrence Kraus. Okay. So, so in the Drake equation, the

57:55.280 --> 58:00.480
letter L stands for the longevity, lifetime of a civilization. Do you really believe that,

58:00.480 --> 58:05.360
that we might be in our final hour, you know, 30 seconds to midnight as this clock is being set

58:05.360 --> 58:12.800
currently? I'd be astounded if we don't do anything clever that we make it 300 years.

58:12.800 --> 58:17.280
Wow. So your approach, and we briefly touched upon this, but I want to delve into it,

58:17.280 --> 58:23.920
does geometric unity offer a potential avenue to, you know, break the speed limit to, to

58:23.920 --> 58:30.160
transgress C as a fundamental limitation? If so, it'll be very interesting to Stephen Wolfram,

58:30.160 --> 58:35.600
because he's claiming in his competing, you know, approach to find a fundamental theory.

58:35.600 --> 58:41.360
He has a competing approach. Well, I'm saying his, his theory of the fundamental physics project

58:41.360 --> 58:47.040
is, is that the speed of light emerges from what he calls branching space, which I take to be

58:47.680 --> 58:53.040
essentially a Hilbert space like object that can subdivide a certain rate. And because of that

58:53.040 --> 58:58.400
limitation and the propagation of these networks, nodes, et cetera, in branching space, the speed

58:58.400 --> 59:03.520
of branch, again, I'm summarizing it, you can watch my interview with him or watch one of his many

59:03.520 --> 59:09.440
well produced and, and, and delightful interviews. But on the other hand, he believes that he can

59:09.440 --> 59:15.200
predict it. It's actually a retro addictive. So wouldn't that stand in contradistinction to any hope

59:15.200 --> 59:21.600
to, to actually find that C is, is just a milestone, if you will, a speed limit that is not truly

59:21.600 --> 59:28.480
fundamental? Yeah, I don't understand the question. Well, a geometric unity, can it, can, can the speed

59:28.480 --> 59:35.120
of light ultimately be derived as a prediction from geometric unity? Or are you, are we sort of

59:35.120 --> 59:40.400
hoping that it might have a, it might not be the fundamental limit? I mean, you're, you seem, you

59:40.400 --> 59:44.160
know, we're worried about the lifetime of civilization, and we want to get far away,

59:44.160 --> 59:52.320
farther away than Saturn, right? Yeah. Would you permit me to rephrase the question slightly?

59:52.320 --> 59:56.400
Please. Yeah. Whether it works. So first part of it is,

59:58.800 --> 01:00:04.240
people tend to feel better if they can link you to something like, Oh, well, your Peter Teal's

01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:10.560
employee, or, Oh, will you and Stephen Wolfram have this rival? None of this is right. I'm,

01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:15.600
I'm super glad that Stephen Wolfram is doing whatever Stephen Wolfram is doing. It has almost

01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:23.600
nothing to do with anything. I know it doesn't. Okay. So just to be clear. I think what your

01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:34.480
question should be is, first of all, how is Einsteinian space time recovered from within

01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:43.840
your theory, given that Newton, for example, had to be recovered from Einstein in low velocity

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:49.280
situation? The question would be given the fact that you're not, because, you see, whenever I say

01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:55.920
something about getting off this rock, people map that, Oh, faster than light. And that assumes

01:00:56.640 --> 01:01:02.000
that you're still staying in the space time paradigm. Right. X four. The idea is that somehow

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:11.120
you've broken the speed limit in the four dimensions with metric. In essence, the claim is,

01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:18.000
is that Einstein fill laid the metric bundle. In other words, one way of looking at Einstein's

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:25.120
theory in a modern context would be that he took four degrees of freedom. He built the metric bundle

01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:34.320
on top of that, which would be a point wise bundle of fibers of dimension 10. Because if you take

01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:41.520
four degrees of freedom, and you take four squared plus four divided by two, that 16 plus four is

01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:46.080
20 divided by two is 10. You get 10 degrees of freedom, which is why Einstein's field equations

01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:55.360
occur in sort of 10 coupled differential equations. Now, that object is only relevant for the

01:01:55.360 --> 01:02:00.720
particular space time metric that Einstein uses to endow the four degrees of freedom

01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:09.600
with this extra structure to create space time. What if that's the big error, that in fact,

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:16.560
you should be having the fields mostly propagate on the 14 dimensional space, which would be the

01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:21.040
four degrees of freedom plus the 10 degrees of rulers and protractors otherwise known as symmetric

01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:30.560
non degenerate two tensors. Then the idea is that a particular choice of Einsteinian metric is a

01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:37.440
section of that bundle that section can be used to pull back information from the 14 dimensions

01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:43.200
down to the four dimension. Then you have this interesting thing, which is maybe not all the

01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:49.200
fields live on the 14. Maybe some are native to the four, some are native to the 14, but they all

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:54.800
appear to be pulled back on the four so that we constantly live in Plato's cave where we can't see

01:02:54.800 --> 01:03:00.960
the 14. We sort of know that this 10 is out there because then in this 10 would sort of be the same

01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:08.240
10 as the spin 10 theory that contains the SU5 grand unified theory, or more correctly my guess is

01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:15.440
is that it lines up with the Petit Salam theory, which is a theory based on the group SU4

01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:27.040
cross SU2 cross SU2. Now SU4 by low dimensional isomorphisms is oddly spin six, whereas SU2

01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:34.000
cross SU2 is another name for spin four. So spin six cross spin four, four plus 10 is 10 again,

01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:40.560
and so you get back to this magical number of 10, and I don't think that I've seen that much

01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:46.960
identifying these 10 dimensions that are hidden in the Petit Salam somewhat more explicit in what

01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:51.840
you guys call SO10, which you should call spin 10, but I don't want to quibble over terminology,

01:03:51.840 --> 01:04:00.960
that's just logomaki. And then you have this issue where that actually has geometric and dynamic

01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:07.040
significance, and what we're looking at is kind of the restriction of these fields to a filament,

01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:12.080
confusing fields that are native to the four with needed fields that are native to the induced 14

01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:21.520
dimensional structure. So that's how Einstein fits in to the observers in the most geometric

01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:28.800
unity is broader than this. It doesn't have to use the metric bundle, but in the most aggressive

01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:35.520
version of geometric unity, that 10 appears twice. And I don't know that that connection has been

01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:43.200
much remarkable. No, I don't think it has. Is it true that you basically would have only fermion-like

01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:50.640
particles, in other words, spin intrinsically spinorial operators or spinners that would then

01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:55.600
compose both the particles and massive particles and also their mediators?

01:04:56.320 --> 01:05:04.640
No. No, no, no. You would have, see, one of the key problems which I can't seem to get any

01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:10.880
physicists to care about is that when you have everybody scurrying around saying that they

01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:16.640
want to quantize gravity, which is sort of weird, it's a weird replacement, right? We used to want

01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:21.360
unified field theories, and then somebody subtly said, oh, the Holy Grail is quantizing gravity.

01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:27.600
An incredible sleight of hand. I find greatest taste. If you want to quantize gravity,

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:33.760
my key question to you is always about the electron as opposed to the photon. The photon

01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:41.680
is a spin one particle would be a perturbation in a bundle that will exist whether or not a metric

01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:46.720
is chosen. So if you imagine that you have a period of time when there is no metric between

01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:55.040
observations, whatever that means, the ocean in which the photon is a wave still is well defined,

01:05:55.040 --> 01:06:01.760
but the wave may not be known. What happens when you don't have a metric and you look at the electron

01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:08.800
ocean? Well, then there's no ocean. In other words, there's a different feature with fractional spin,

01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:15.360
which you're going to call fermions or matter as well, which is that finite dimensional matter is

01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:25.440
not defined for what would be called gl4r double cover. So you have a flabby symmetry group,

01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:32.400
and you only get the ocean of electrons once you take the flab out of it and make it rigid.

01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:38.000
So if you want to quantize gravity, I always want to know, I understand sort of what you

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:44.400
might need in a world of photons only, but if there are fermions in your world, I have no idea

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:48.240
what you're talking about when you want to quantize gravity between observations because

01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:53.520
it's one thing not to know where the waves are. It's another thing to misplace the Pacific between

01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:59.760
every, you know, every moment that you don't have rulers in protract. This is a big problem,

01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:06.720
and one of the things geometric unity does is it finds a spinner bundle that does not depend on

01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:12.960
metric. It just can't have a four-dimensional space. It's forced into the 14, and it's not the

01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:17.440
honest spinner bundle that you associate with the tangent bundle. It's very closely related,

01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:21.040
something called the chimeric tangent bundle, which leads to chimeric spinners.

01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:28.800
Upstairs in the 14-dimensional world, you're interested in both bosons and fermions. In

01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:34.880
fact, you're just in something like the supergroup structure, and that object upstairs

01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:44.160
pulls back to what we seem to perceive. As far as I'm concerned, I think we're having a 14-dimensional

01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:55.920
conversation. Usually accused of being one-dimensional, not more. I think we're having

01:07:55.920 --> 01:08:00.000
a 14-dimensional conversation, and we're taking a four-dimensional filament of it,

01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:05.600
and maybe that's what Sean Carroll is talking about when he's going on, about how he believes

01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:11.840
wholeheartedly in the multiverse. 50% of them anyway, 50% of them he doesn't. I don't know,

01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:18.000
but I just think that in general, what happened is that around the time the unified field theory

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:23.520
gave way to quantizing gravity, nobody noticed the slight hand. Nobody noticed the real conceptual

01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:31.920
problems, and that you've got generations of people repeating what their more recent ancestors

01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:37.040
said that would have shocked, I think, a lot of the guys who actually built this stuff in the early

01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:43.040
20th century. So you've mentioned, are we off of this topic for now, Eric? Or you want to?

01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:48.880
I don't know. I mean, it's your podcast. If you want to talk about physics.

01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:53.280
Yeah, I'd like to talk physics. I'd like to talk about, because again, I use

01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:58.480
simple-minded. I like to treat everything like a nail, and my hammer is looking at things through

01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:03.440
experimental lenses. Before we do that, we briefly touched on Popper, and we briefly touched on

01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:08.480
Girdle, and I had this conversation with Stephen Wolfram, and I've had it with other thinkers

01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:15.280
ranging from Freeman Dyson to Roger Penrose and Jim Gates, and I'd like to know your take on this.

01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:21.200
I believe that physicists are suffering from math envy and Freudian language

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:27.840
replacing certain protuberance with the word math, and that's in a sense that Girdle at least

01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:32.720
showed them the limits of what was possible in mathematics or impossible, the so-called

01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:40.800
incompleteness theorem. And for decades, or maybe not, it's been taken as sort of sacrosanct at a

01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:49.040
level, which I believe is unearned, that Popper provided an analog for physicists, for ways to

01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:55.760
determine the credulity one should have in a physical theory, and that was whether or not it

01:09:55.760 --> 01:10:01.920
could be falsified. And falsification has come to mean not just evidence or evidence against,

01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:08.720
but even the ability to retro-dict certain things that are known to be subsumed within the theoretical

01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:18.000
or physical theory. I'm wondering, do you believe in Popper's dialectic, or do you believe in his

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:24.480
demarcation claim, or is there something superior in your mind that could replace it? And then,

01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:29.280
obviously, I want to turn that to geometric unity. So first, what do you think about the Girdle,

01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:35.520
Popper distinction that I'm making here? These are these beautiful hopes that we're going to be

01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:40.960
able to codify what science is and what science isn't. I think it's important that we say why

01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:48.000
we're animated by this. Trying to get rid of cranks and losers and freaks and weirdos distract us

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:52.800
and figure out what the magic formula is that we can do science by so that we can say, look,

01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:59.280
we're an open community. We welcome everyone who wants to try to pull the sword out of the stone.

01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:03.760
And in fact, you guys broke the rules, so you guys don't get to try anymore. And the people

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:07.280
who are playing by the rules, good kids and the other ones get a lump in their stock.

01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:11.760
So that's what our motivation is, because frankly, we don't want a huge line of

01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:17.440
incompetence trying their hand. It takes days to debunk somebody who's filled with bunk,

01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:22.640
and there's always 12 more behind that person. So I think it's really much better to talk about

01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:27.520
the political economy of this and talk about the opportunity cost of debunking people. It's very

01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:36.720
expensive to talk about it. What I find ridiculous is when people treat somebody like me like that,

01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:42.960
because they're looking for a demarcation solution, which is, it's just very silly,

01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:47.920
but the locals sometimes want to play that game. In general, I haven't found that many people want

01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:53.920
to play with me, but let's keep going. I think that we're in some very different place with

01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:58.400
Popper. And what I've said before is that the scientific method is actually the radio

01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:04.480
edit of great science. And I mean something very particular by that. Great science is whatever

01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:11.680
people have done to make major advances, and then whatever people might do to make major advances.

01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:15.920
And I remember hanging out with Jim Watson, where he more or less said that Rosalind Franklin was a

01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:22.880
much better scientist than he was. But his point was that we were great scientists and she was very,

01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:27.280
very good. And we were not very, very good. Not just that great is better than good. It's two

01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:33.760
different styles. You want to look at a really revolutionary essay he wrote, something like

01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:41.760
succeeding in science rules of thumb or something like that. The style of great science is in general

01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:48.720
indefensible. If you looked at, in my opinion, sort of the three great names of 20th century

01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:52.240
physics, and I'm going to come up with a list that other people aren't going to love,

01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:57.920
they're going to agree with me on Einstein and Dirac. And then weirdly, Frank Yang, C. N. Yang,

01:12:57.920 --> 01:13:01.840
gets left off because people want to say Weinberg, Feynman, something like that.

01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:09.040
I find that very weird. I think Yang is way up there. But those guys are the ones with their

01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:14.800
names on the laws of nature. And if you look at what they say, they're all talking about beauty.

01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:23.600
So they're not withstanding. But the problem is, have beauty as a method. There is the beauty

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:29.840
method in science. And it almost never works, except for our very best people. So if you go

01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:34.720
to look right at the top of theoretical physics, everyone's talking about beauty, but it's like

01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:42.320
three guys. And what do you do with a method that's a little bit like

01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:49.680
what was it? The Blackbird aircraft that almost no one can fly, but it's the highest performance

01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:55.280
airplane in the sky. Well, that's what the beauty method is. It's not about popper,

01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:58.720
it's not about falsifications, but intuition, it's about guts, it's about

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:06.000
all the things that you want to tell if you're an average person, do not use this. It will

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:12.000
cause you to crash into the rocks. So trying to give advice for good science and advice for

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:17.280
great science is very frustrating because it's not the same thing. In general, great science

01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:27.040
looks like bad science that happens to work. And well, it's like, okay, Kikuli is thinking about

01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:32.960
a snake eating itself, and it turns out to be benzene. How are you going to recommend people

01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:36.880
do that? There's an old joke or something about that, we don't use the Feynman method in this

01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:40.080
class. What's the Feynman method? You look at the problem, you think you're hard, you're right down

01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:47.840
the answer. We have to recognize that in general, there isn't a scientific method.

01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:53.200
There's something that we can clean up and show to try to say that what we're doing is defensible

01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:56.560
and that we're not talking mumbo jumbo, but I'm going to tell you the horrible dirty secret at

01:14:56.560 --> 01:15:03.680
the bottom of all of this. It's about taste and everyone knows it. Whether or not you give,

01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:08.240
you know, who was it? I guess it was Murray Gelman who gave Schwartz a job at Caltech because

01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:12.320
he had the sense that this guy's working on something important. Whether I'm a string theory

01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:19.200
booster or not is not really the important point. You know, Schwartz Gelman was right.

01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:26.960
And you have this problem that at the bottom of all of this is not something that is sanitized

01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:34.560
that can be cleaned up to show your parents. This is a terrifying, marginal, bizarre activity.

01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:39.600
And this is part of why you get people who are so angry about people breaking the rules,

01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:47.840
because honestly, those aren't the rules. Peer review has not been long in our world.

01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:55.440
This is about personal communications. If you look at what happened with Freeman Dyson,

01:15:56.080 --> 01:16:02.880
trying to defend Feynman to Oppenheimer and having to call in Beta. And then, you know,

01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:08.080
Oppenheimer puts this note in his inbox, no low contendry, and the guy had a job at the Institute

01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:11.760
for Advanced Study with no PhD and neither math or physics for the rest of his life.

01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:20.720
This is how bad asses get shit done, is that it's about knowing people so intimately and trusting

01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:28.160
people so intimately and having enough resources that you can run something like the RNA Tie Club

01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:33.520
and share early results knowing that everybody's good enough to get their own goddamn Nobel Prize.

01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:37.120
And if they don't get Nobel Prize, everybody knows who's good anyway. We don't really need

01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:42.960
this internally. Nobody's confused about Stuckelberg outside of the, you know, inside the community.

01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:48.400
We all know that he was super important. He got shafted. So it's very important to recognize

01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:59.280
this is a small intimate activity of weirdos, freaks, madmen. It's a circus. And the adorable

01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:06.320
focus on the demarcation problem that comes from history and sociology of science programs

01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:11.680
is very touching and sweet, but they should get the hell out of our fields and let us get down to

01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:16.320
work and do what we do best, which is breaking rules and doing anything that's been known ever

01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:21.680
to come to an end. But of course, there's the, you know, greater possible abstract space of

01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:26.560
possibly true theories or possibly true laws of nature than actually true. And I think what you

01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:30.800
care about, you know, Einstein famously said imagination is more important than knowledge.

01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:35.600
But as I said, I was talking to Sasha Sagan, Carl Sagan's daughter yesterday on the podcast.

01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:40.800
And, you know, here's her father's doll of her father. And, and we're, I was saying, you know,

01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:44.800
imagination is great. And it's wonderful to have it. And we should cultivate it. Obviously,

01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:49.200
Arthur C. Clarke Center for Human Imagination. But I don't want my neurosurgeon, God forbid,

01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:53.440
you know, to be like, I'm going to be really creative, you know, and curious about, you know,

01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:56.720
Brian's brain surgery, God forbid, you know, I want him to have a lot of knowledge or her to

01:17:56.720 --> 01:18:02.720
have a lot of knowledge. And in the case of, you know, these theories, who decides that's wrong?

01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:09.360
Well, you, so you would like to have a creative approach to, you know, things that have a true

01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:14.560
yes or no, I'm arguing Dirac wouldn't have been Dirac. He said, it's more important your equations

01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:17.520
be beautiful than that they be right or something to that effect.

01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:23.040
More important to have beauty in one's equations than that they fit experiment.

01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:27.600
Yeah. And so it sounds like you agree with that. And I'm saying the ultimate, Dirac didn't become

01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:34.320
Dirac until we discovered the truth of his, of the Dirac equation of the existence of,

01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:38.240
which he was wrong about originally identifying the positive. I mean, I'm not faulting him.

01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:42.080
Obviously, he went on to a good career, despite what Brian Keating might think about it. But,

01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:47.280
the point is, it is the arbiter. I might be arguing my own book, but, but I'm arguing that

01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:51.600
we need experiment to, to validate it. And maybe that's the ultimate gatekeeper in your language.

01:18:52.400 --> 01:19:00.160
Okay. So, so explain this. This is the problem that we're weak. And this is physics bowing down

01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:08.400
to history and sociology of science. The key point was, why did Einstein know what he was doing

01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:13.280
when Einstein and Grossman appeared, I think in 1913, which is vaguely said,

01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:19.280
the answer is something like a linear expression in the Riemann curvature tensor equal to the

01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:25.440
stress energy, not specifying what it was. Then he gets it wrong. And he says it's the

01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:35.680
Ricci tensor distilled. And that was shown not to be, what's the operator you guys call it,

01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:41.840
perpendicular to the orbits, co-variantly, not co-variantly constant, but divergence free.

01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:46.640
Maybe you call it divergence free. So then he puts in the one half scalar curvature correction

01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:52.000
to that. And that's not enough because of Hubble. So then you put in the cosmological

01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:57.520
and then Hilbert finds, okay, your super complicated equation is actually the simplest

01:19:57.520 --> 01:20:02.880
Euler Lagrange equation that comes from the simplest action. You know, it's like, okay, well,

01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:10.080
how did he know ahead of time that he was on the right path? He kept correcting it. And then

01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:16.560
this whole thing about the electron versus the positron. Now, Dirac wasn't wrong. He was

01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:22.720
insufficiently courageous. And, you know, this is exactly where I'm going through, which is like,

01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:29.760
when you have detractors, you're constantly trying to placate your detractors. Oh, no, no,

01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:35.760
I didn't say that. I didn't mean that. Oh, please, please. I mean, it's just stupid. The issue is,

01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:42.080
if you'd let him say, okay, yeah, I don't have the answer for that. If you stop pushing for

01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:47.040
agreement, stop pushing for immediate agreement with experiment. I mean, this is the difference

01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:53.920
between authors and copy editors. The copy editors have taken over at some levels. You've got the

01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:58.800
lunatics promoting the string theoretic agenda, which has completely failed that they can't be in,

01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:04.080
they can't be honest about. And then you've got the copy editors, which is like, you didn't say

01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:12.480
Simon says, it's like, shut up enough. It's something in between. It's a very fine sensibility.

01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:17.600
And it has to do with a tiny number of people. The thing is intrinsically elitist,

01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:22.880
is what you're using before you get to the ability to agree with the experiment.

01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:26.560
Is the question that in the end, it has to agree with the experiment? Of course.

01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:30.400
But like, that's some super late stage thing. And again,

01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:30.800
Oh, yeah.

01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:35.280
It's a problem of privileging the tailor as if the tailor made the suit.

01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:40.240
But I got to agree with the experiment. He put the last dot on the last eye.

01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:46.000
Really? I mean, are you that soulless that you can't actually recognize that

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.400
Hilbert was not in a race with Einstein?

01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:55.120
I think if you look at it and you see, you know, you see the prestige levels, and I'm not, you know,

01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:59.840
one for going through the sociology of science any more than I believe you are, but you look at

01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:06.240
the prestige afforded to physicists. And, you know, it goes, it goes, as you said, it'll go,

01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:12.880
you know, Einstein in this last, you know, 150 years, you know, Bohr, it'll go to Feynman, it'll

01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:17.760
go, if it makes it to someone who did an experiment, it'll be Fermi. And, you know, we can argue and

01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:22.080
debate it whether or not he was. So I think you're certainly right. The prestige goes to it. And I

01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:24.640
think I can't shut up about Madam Wu.

01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:30.320
Yeah. Right. You look at that. And then you look at many of the great discoveries by quote,

01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:35.520
unquote, experimentalists or non theorists and, you know, resulting in Nobel prizes or other

01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:40.400
metrics. Pick your favorite one. You know, our first serendipitous discoveries that we, you know,

01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:46.960
maybe even the theorists had discounted. But, but it's usually not, I think Dickey is an exception,

01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:52.640
because I think he was equally, you know, facile with with his theory. And he was a top notch

01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:57.360
experimentalist. He's kind of my hero in that sense. And he harkens back to the Galileo model.

01:22:57.360 --> 01:23:06.000
But, you know, that being said, if there were ways to channel, to test GU, I mean, could, could we

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:11.200
speculate as to what they are? Because I think, I think, Eric, there are ways to test it. I mean,

01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:13.920
you are talking about certain things in your, in your lecture.

01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:15.600
I'm not trying to avoid that, Brian.

01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:16.720
Yeah. No, I know you are.

01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:20.400
What I'm trying to avoid is, is that I'm trying to avoid the deep...

01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:24.400
infant mortality, the infant mortality that would come from, oh, this is not worth pursuing,

01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:28.400
because he's not putting it in a journal and requiring an experiment. I know that's a high bar.

01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:38.000
No, it's not that. It's just, I'm sickened by watching a noble family forget its role in the

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:46.640
world. Right? Like, you know, it's the arrogance without the accomplishment. You guys haven't figured

01:23:46.640 --> 01:23:53.280
out, you have to tell the interlopers from outside. You know, this is something, it's

01:23:53.280 --> 01:24:00.720
an elitist activity. Like, as much as I hate to say it, the top three guys in the 20th century

01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:09.760
were just different. They were, they were using different methods. I might even in group Feynman,

01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:13.520
and I might talk about Stuckelberg, which people aren't going to necessarily want to hear about.

01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:24.720
You can't, it's not egalitarian. It's, it's not fair. It's not a fair subject. And if you want,

01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:28.400
well, tell me, tell me what science is and what, what it isn't so that I can apply the rule. It's

01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:35.360
like, okay, when you're up at, when you're up this high above the tree line, the world works

01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:40.320
differently. And nobody, there's no reason that an ape should be able to do these things. It's

01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:49.120
a huge surprise that this is even possible. With that said, my frustration is that this

01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:56.560
noble family has fallen into so much poverty that it can't behave properly scientifically.

01:24:57.520 --> 01:25:03.280
And my story about Oppenheimer and Dyson was that maybe, maybe Dyson did need Beta to come in and

01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:10.160
say, Hey, pay attention to the kid. He's got, he's got it going on. But it got done. It worked out.

01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:17.440
People did not lose their livelihoods, their jobs. They didn't need PhDs. It's like, we knew who

01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:23.280
was good and who wasn't. We gave them time. We gave them space. And so you're coming after me.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:28.640
Huh, the joke's on you. I'm not even, I mean, I'm using none of your resources at all. What are

01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:33.040
you going to do? Cut off my oxygen? You can't. Absolutely can't. You can cut off my internet.

01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:42.000
Yeah, but you want to get back to testing. The key point is, imagine people came to say,

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:46.320
instead of, Hey, how do we get rid of you? They said, we're really interested.

01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:51.200
What do you think you might be telling us? We know you're not a physicist. We know that you're

01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:56.400
working at a geometric level. We know that it needs to be quantized. We know that you don't

01:25:56.400 --> 01:26:01.360
understand exactly how we calculate and quantum field theory. Marcus, you're terrible pedagogues.

01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:10.240
Um, what could we do constructively? I'd be all over that. Well, I've got some suggestions. Say,

01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:15.280
let me just say something. Yeah, go ahead. Brian Keating, Professor Brian Keating is unusual

01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:21.440
in that he's been after me for years to come to UC San Diego and lecture, which is very courageous.

01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:24.880
So I don't know if I'm courageous, but I know, sir, that you are. I want you to be

01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:30.400
a visiting scholar here, actually, which it would be an absolute honor, be an absolute honor.

01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:36.400
What I would say is a bunch of new particles that I can read off their properties

01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:43.200
relative to the internal symmetry groups. So we've got weak hypercharge. We guys have been

01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:49.440
strong internal quantum numbers. There are a huge number of new particles that are predicted in

01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:54.960
this theory to exist. Now, the instant I say the word prediction, I get into a different thing.

01:26:55.440 --> 01:27:00.560
First of all, what, what energy level would we have seen them? You know, where, where, where would

01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:05.680
they be in the, in the, in the, in the, in the Swiss and the decay rates, blah, blah, blah.

01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:11.520
And it's like, okay, so that's that energy of whatever. I don't know how to do all that stuff.

01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:16.080
I can tell you that if it was somebody else coming up with this theory, they'd say, oh,

01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:18.800
well, we would think that we should have seen them. That would be like

01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:24.720
Dirac saying the antiparticle of the electron must be the proton because I don't know of a

01:27:24.720 --> 01:27:29.280
positively charged particle of the electron because the positron hadn't been found by Anderson.

01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:35.680
Stupid Dirac. Yeah. Stupid Dirac. Right. But like, if you pressure me, I don't know,

01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:39.520
and I'll make the same mistake Dirac makes, and then you can have your Heisenberg come out and

01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:44.800
say, oh, Eric didn't know about this. Let's leave that energy aside. Yeah. If it was somebody inside

01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:48.640
of the community, they might say, look, I've got something that fits almost everything,

01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:51.680
and it's off a little bit over here. Let's tailor it together.

01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:55.920
Well, that would be an invitation to a conversation. What could we do? Is there

01:27:55.920 --> 01:28:01.360
a new field that we might introduce to suppress it? Maybe this is actually naturally occurring.

01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:08.400
Same point about Dirac and Schroeder. You know, maybe, oh, you didn't take into account this

01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:12.880
aspect of spin. What can I tell you about the theory? First of all, I don't think that what you

01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:17.920
guys call antimatter is antimatter. I think there's an entirely different sector that would

01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:22.560
properly be understood as antimatter. I think there's a 14-dimensional space. You guys are

01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:27.280
applying these things all in dimension four. I think that there's spin three halves matter that

01:28:27.280 --> 01:28:32.800
is actually real. I don't think that one of the three generations is a true generation. I believe

01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:39.280
that if you amp it up in terms of energy, it will unify with other particles you've never seen.

01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:45.920
I believe that probably in gravitationally weak places, what we see is a decoupling of equations,

01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:50.000
but the near black holes, you might very well see the things that have been decoupled become

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:56.240
coupled, and therefore a lot of stuff might come surging into view, and so that what was dark might

01:28:56.240 --> 01:29:00.320
become light. I mean, there's any one of a number of things that you can read off.

01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:08.320
I don't think that I've had a single, friendly, competent inquiry in a month

01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:12.800
since I released it. Well, yeah, I've been thinking about it since you released it,

01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:17.040
and we made contact last week. I want to talk to you about, well, first of all,

01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:21.280
I want to talk to you about something you kind of made as an offhand comment in your April Fool's

01:29:21.280 --> 01:29:24.480
Day podcast, and I'm sorry to keep calling it that. It's just easier for me to remember.

01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:30.240
Oh, that's what I tried to do. I wanted, if this works, let's imagine, just dream with me.

01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:31.520
Yeah, yeah.

01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:32.480
Soon that it works.

01:29:32.480 --> 01:29:33.200
Yep.

01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:34.800
Published on April Fool's Day.

01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:42.480
Right. And every year, all the pent-up energy of all of these communities would,

01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:47.760
you'd be able to air these things without losing your job. Oh, this is the Weinstein tradition.

01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:52.640
Like, you want to talk about honoring me. Imagine that every year we could say things like,

01:29:52.640 --> 01:29:59.040
I wonder if stress doesn't cause ulcers. I wonder if grains should be at the base of the food pyramid.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:06.960
I wonder whether or not the Yamabi problem solution in the literature really works.

01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:10.400
I wonder if the weak force might be asymmetric.

01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:19.760
You know, how many things have we been afraid to say? Like, with COVID, I'm positively convinced

01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:23.920
that there are doctors who are looking at this saying, no, make no dissent, so this doesn't

01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:34.080
make sense. It doesn't work. Something is weirdly off. The danger, the danger of this is that people

01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:40.800
are holding back for fear of being drummed out of their fields. So the whole point of releasing

01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:49.360
on April 1st is my fantasy would be if this were to work, not only getting humans off this planet,

01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:55.840
but making sure two things. One, that an H index of zero became a respectable thing, saying,

01:30:55.840 --> 01:31:00.800
I choose not to avail myself of your insane community and its bizarre rituals because you're

01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:05.280
knarks and you're trying to fight the cranks, but lots of us are neither knark nor crank.

01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:16.560
And every year, I want you to know that you have a day where you're free. Yeah.

01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:21.920
The same thing. Like, I think David Gross is not leading the theoretical physics community

01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:27.680
properly and is brilliant as Ed Whitman. I think he's contributing and not lose your job.

01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:33.280
Yeah, I kind of see it as a, what's that movie where they have like one day of the year they

01:31:33.280 --> 01:31:41.920
can commit any crime. But as another listeners are screaming, I mean, I'll put it in the show

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:48.320
notes, people, don't worry. But there's a, and then unavoidably, if you are, it'll be essential

01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:53.520
to quote that it was released on April Fool's Day. So I think it's a brilliant piece of intentional

01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:58.320
or unintentional. It was recorded on April Fool's Day, I released, missed by a few minutes. I know,

01:31:58.320 --> 01:32:02.640
I know, but I'm just going to keep calling it that. Anyway, in your, in your, in the podcast,

01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:08.400
you talk about, you know, one of the great moments of, of relief for you, at least at some point,

01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:13.760
when you discovered that, you know, your theory wouldn't work if neutrinos were massless,

01:32:13.760 --> 01:32:18.160
but it did work because we know that they have masses. We don't know what their masses are.

01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:24.480
And I wonder if you are aware, you probably are, but, but it's not absolutely known that the,

01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:30.160
that all three neutrino species have mass. In other words, there's only known to be a mass

01:32:30.160 --> 01:32:34.320
difference, a mass squared difference to be technical between two, you know, the two different

01:32:34.880 --> 01:32:39.200
eigen, eigenstates. But we don't know, actually, one of them could be massless. Would that,

01:32:39.200 --> 01:32:45.600
in some way, false, if we discover that one species is massless, you know, mu one or something

01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:50.720
like that, one flavor, then would that, would that be a falsification opportunity for the

01:32:50.720 --> 01:32:56.400
popper? What it really needs is it needs, if you think about the SU five theory, let's say,

01:32:57.360 --> 01:33:06.480
grand unified theory, there's like a five and an anti representation, you can put in an inactive

01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:14.080
singlet. But the important thing is, is that it'd be 16 particles in a generation. And so the issue

01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:19.280
that I was having, it wasn't even necessarily the case that it wasn't, that there weren't 16

01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:24.240
particles. But people were still very much trying to be conservative and saying, well, why don't

01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:33.520
hypothesize, if you have, what is it, a right handed neutral, you know, then it's effectively dark.

01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:43.360
And so the key issue is just that there'd be a spinorial representation, not really about mass.

01:33:44.480 --> 01:33:50.320
So it's easier to say it in terms of masses and neutrinos, but I'm not trying to hide anything.

01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:56.080
So I'm just, I'll say the more, the more correct version is, it has to come from a 16

01:33:56.880 --> 01:34:04.720
dimensional representation, or rather a spinorial representation to the end, or

01:34:05.760 --> 01:34:09.920
you can do it more broadly with the Rarita Schwinger, but it's a very restricted class of it.

01:34:12.960 --> 01:34:18.640
So that would not be, you know, if we, her cosmological experiments like Simon's observatory

01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:24.880
and bicep, et cetera, are trying to, you know, in some level constrain the mass and neutrino,

01:34:25.440 --> 01:34:31.440
the sum of the mass of neutrinos. And then that combined with reactor experiments might actually

01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:37.040
reveal the absolute masses instead of just the sum of their squares and square rooted, so to speak.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:43.600
I'm getting questions from a listener who wants me to ask you, is a distinguished professor at

01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:47.360
Brown University, and he's asking me to ask you in real time.

01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:48.800
Does he play the saxophone?

01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:53.520
He does play the saxophone. He does. He's also the president of the National Society of Black

01:34:53.520 --> 01:34:58.480
Physicists, which I am a proud honorary member of. And yes, it is Stefan Alexander,

01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:04.240
best friend and best man at my wedding. And Stefan's asking in real time, what is your

01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:07.840
theory? You have to say about the cosmological constant problem or about dark matter. We've

01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:13.760
sort of hit on antimatter. Tell us, answer Stefan's question about the cosmological constant

01:35:14.320 --> 01:35:15.440
and or dark matter.

01:35:16.720 --> 01:35:23.520
So first of all, I would say that the cosmological constant would not be a constant. It would be

01:35:23.520 --> 01:35:27.280
a VEV. I mean, look, I'm going to try to speak physics and hang.

01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:28.480
Yeah, please do. Yeah.

01:35:29.200 --> 01:35:30.640
But if I screw up.

01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:32.320
It's okay. You get a pass.

01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:33.440
Don't try this at home, kids.

01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:35.920
You could put on the mathematician hat if you make a mistake.

01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:44.320
Well, we don't talk like this. I would say that it's a VEV and the VEV is lured away from zero

01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:51.600
because there is a curvature piece that is pervasive that as the universe is spread out.

01:35:53.040 --> 01:35:59.120
Got to keep talking like this as the cross section three dimensional space like cross

01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:07.440
section is spread out that VEV has gotten very low. But it's still non zero and that the

01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:16.720
look, let me just say it this way that that you're luring something away from zero potentially

01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:22.560
because you've got a topological contribution. And if you have some sort of

01:36:23.280 --> 01:36:28.080
Gauss-Penet theorem, then you have to be able to recover the topology from the curvature.

01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:31.520
So you could have a reason that you couldn't get rid of the curvature, but you could spread it out.

01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:36.720
And therefore you have counterbalance in Germany with respect to dark matter.

01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:39.280
There's a lot of it.

01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:44.880
Part this is the decoupling. So the claim is that the matter wasn't dark originally

01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:51.600
in high gravitational situation, but it became dark. And as the VEV went down and effectively

01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:58.560
a coupled equation broke into effectively decoupled equation. And the decoupled equations

01:36:58.560 --> 01:37:05.440
would have things like dark light, dark glons, axions. So there's a ton of

01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:13.040
there's a ton to be speculated and you don't know that it broke the way your half broke.

01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:19.040
So if you iron sort of one half of the stuff. And again, when I say half, I don't

01:37:19.920 --> 01:37:25.840
there's stuff that we haven't found in our half in this theory, stuff that is decoupled.

01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:35.600
So, so there's like, it's more than half would be dark. But you might be able to say, look,

01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:41.200
I don't know exactly how that the other part broke. But what I would say is,

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:49.600
you know that how it would unify. The example I just give to people who are watching

01:37:51.040 --> 01:37:58.480
is if you have a hand, you see three fingers, two and four, your digits two and four pretty

01:37:58.480 --> 01:38:03.120
symmetric and the middle finger is symmetric. But you could say, Oh, I wonder if there's a

01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:08.640
symmetry there where my index and my ring finger are mirror images of each other.

01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:13.120
And then you throw in these two and you say, Oh, shoot, well, maybe it's spontaneously broken.

01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:18.480
And, you know, these things are like, weirdly often, maybe my thumb and my pinky are more or

01:38:18.480 --> 01:38:24.560
less the same. And then you find out, Oh my God, it's thumb to thumb, not thumb to pinky.

01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:31.360
And this stuff is dark because it's decoupled. And so this is all remaining to be found.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:37.280
And this is where the proper anti matter would be. But because you're not even aware of the 14

01:38:37.280 --> 01:38:40.960
dimensional substrate, you're thinking about everything in four dimensional terms, which

01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:49.760
is after it's been pulled back. And so if we're done with that thread particular answer, because

01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:54.400
I've asked Stefan, he's the man. All right. Well, he's not listening live. Unfortunately,

01:38:54.400 --> 01:38:57.600
we should, we should have called them in, but I think we'll do that. Brother Stefan,

01:38:57.600 --> 01:39:02.240
how could you do this? I know he's just, we're just texting back and forth sharing pictures of

01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:06.880
our daughters. Today is his daughter's birthday. 12th birthday or something, right?

01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:12.720
That's right. Yeah, I wish her a happy birthday from you. I want to stick with mysterious particles

01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:17.440
and ask you if they've maybe already been found. I want to quote from an article in

01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:23.200
not the most, you know, necessarily prestigious scientific journal, but Scientific American,

01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:27.840
no less. It's not a peer reviewed journal, but it's a discussion of mysterious particles

01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:33.600
lurking underground. And this is underground, the, the great icy continent that I've been to

01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:38.800
a couple of times called Antarctica, in particular, two experiments that seem to show some concordance

01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:44.800
and at least in the middle, this is Anita and ice cube. So ice cube, I think it'll be interesting

01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:49.040
for you to talk to an ice actual ice cube scientist and an Anita scientist, but they claim

01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:54.880
that the particles that they're finding, they don't have much understanding. And technically,

01:39:54.880 --> 01:40:00.400
this is two particles, two events, but extremely high significance statistically speaking.

01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:06.400
We call 5.8 sigma and seven sigma. So these are, you know, chances of fluke occurrence to that

01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:14.080
the hundred thousand to million, one in a million level. And if those are possible, certainly,

01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:19.040
you know, not seeing them, it would be like the magnetic monopole problem, which was claimed,

01:40:19.040 --> 01:40:24.160
again, on a special date on a holiday to be discovered at Stanford Blaschke-Barrows group,

01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:29.440
the Valentine's Day event, where he claimed back in 1987, I believe that he detected the

01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:36.320
magnetic monopole in our universe. And that was later, later had to be reanalyzed and at least

01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:40.480
to claim it wasn't a blunder. It was just not as significant. I think Gillian Maxwell has the

01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:45.360
other one. Yes, that's right. They're, they're sneaking around trading between different places

01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:49.600
on planet Earth. But what do you make about these particles? Is there a way to, I mean,

01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:54.880
so here's an opportunity, geometric unity, you know, can we say how would these fit in

01:40:54.880 --> 01:41:00.480
to the geometric unity framework? Invite me to a physics department. I will. You already have

01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:09.040
an invitation. So we have not, yeah. But this is the issue, which is that I'm, I live so far off

01:41:09.120 --> 01:41:17.680
of your grid that I'm not going to seminars. I'm not discussing the stuff with people.

01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:24.080
So I don't really know how to answer that, but I can show you what the representations are,

01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:32.640
what the equations are, what the Lagrangians are. And, you know, in large measure, what holds me up

01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:38.400
from just sort of saying is this issue about the tailoring, which is I don't want to get

01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:42.480
into a war about the tailoring. Well, you said it's this and actually you forgot a factor of,

01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:49.280
you know, I over two, no, but, but I've played with these guys before and I can't

01:41:50.160 --> 01:41:53.840
end it. I don't think you have. I actually have to challenge you there. I don't, I think you're

01:41:53.840 --> 01:41:58.960
painting all physicists, including my brethren and sister in experimental physics with the same

01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:03.440
brush that may or may not be justified. Okay. So, so great. So what I would like is I would

01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:09.200
like a full-throated acknowledgement of work in economics and gauge theory from Mr. Juan Maldesena.

01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:14.960
It would be my pleasure because I'm a huge fan of wands and I'm not a detractor of wands.

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:21.760
That held up as the credit that should have gone to myself and Pia Malani and your wife.

01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:24.480
Yes, I know that, but I have no control over that. What I do have control over.

01:42:24.480 --> 01:42:30.160
No, I understand that. I'm just trying to say you want to talk about the, you know, when I submitted

01:42:30.160 --> 01:42:37.520
certain work at Harvard, which was peculiar to dimension eight, one of the things was, well,

01:42:37.520 --> 01:42:43.360
if you can't solve this in the Arctonionic Projected Plane, then it's nothing. And well,

01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:49.440
the Arctonionic Projected Plane is dimension 16. So I've played various games of Gotcha and Simon

01:42:49.440 --> 01:42:56.880
says, and what you're looking at is somebody who is mature, but also is traumatized and traumatized

01:42:56.880 --> 01:43:06.640
specifically by the nonsense of these games. So I would love to participate. I would love to play,

01:43:07.360 --> 01:43:14.720
but in part what it means is I will not be playing the game. Like, you know, people always love to

01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:19.840
say, Hilberg, you know, and Einstein weren't a race for the equation. They were not. If Einstein

01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:24.720
and Grossman's first paper was all that we had and he never put anything else in it, it would still

01:43:24.720 --> 01:43:29.680
be general relativity due to Einstein and Grossman. So I'm going to push back on your pushback and I'm

01:43:29.680 --> 01:43:36.800
saying, no, the field really has a problem with credit and attribution. That was 116 years ago,

01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:41.760
but I will say it's gotten worse since then. In a theory, I can't speak to that. I agree with you

01:43:42.320 --> 01:43:47.680
in principle because I have seen nastiness. Maybe it's unique to UC San Diego, which has produced

01:43:47.680 --> 01:43:53.360
such luminaries as your enemy, Dr. Garrett Leasy. He's not my enemy. He's my arch nemesis.

01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:59.280
Arch nemesis. Sorry. We love Garrett here and he's a good friend, hopefully come on the podcast soon

01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:04.640
as well. But I want to talk about, you know, this notion. There is a difference between

01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:13.680
Let me just get back to it. It would be a great pleasure to see, to have the Anita experiments

01:44:13.680 --> 01:44:18.160
translated from an experimental finding having to do with things apparently coming through the

01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:25.760
surface of the earth, yada, yada, yada into bundle geometric language. And I can come some of the

01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:31.520
way towards experimental, but, you know, I don't know, maybe that requires me being somewhere

01:44:31.520 --> 01:44:35.280
for a week in constant dialogue. And I don't think I've done that since I've been at the

01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:41.120
Perimeter Institute, you know, I know almost a decade ago. Oh yeah, we're a 90 minute, you know,

01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:46.880
train ride away. So, but let me say this, I had a conversation with none other than Sir Roger Penrose

01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:51.280
who's been on your podcast and I take it as somewhat of an inspiration to you as he is to me.

01:44:51.920 --> 01:44:56.400
And he sat down and he told me, I believe that your bicep results were correct that you did

01:44:56.480 --> 01:45:01.200
detect b-modes. And they just weren't from inflation, you know, he has a theory called the

01:45:01.200 --> 01:45:07.360
conformal cyclic cosmological model that features an inflationless, you know, aeon system of aeon

01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:13.600
cycling back and forth between different eras aeons as he calls them. And he pointed out evidence

01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:18.000
being, you know, these so-called hawking points that he claims were discovered in our maps. And

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:24.240
he pointed to the images that we produced and the publication held the great fanfare in 2014.

01:45:24.240 --> 01:45:29.360
And I stopped them and I said, Roger, those are basically, you know, PR shots. Those are,

01:45:29.360 --> 01:45:33.840
those have zero scientific content within them. Anything that you find in it, what I would take

01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:39.600
to be almost a falsification of your theory that these exist because these are highly processed.

01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:44.320
And none of the details, it's just basically like a sketch. Like if I, if I released an artist's

01:45:44.320 --> 01:45:48.960
sketch of a criminal, it's no more or less, you know, credible than the, you know, than,

01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:53.760
than, you know, basically a computer generated image. It's just publicity. And he said to me,

01:45:53.760 --> 01:45:58.240
these wonderful, you know, words basically like, Oh, well, then I have to reevaluate that. But I,

01:45:58.240 --> 01:46:02.560
you know, could it be possible that this other element magnetic fields survive, not the black

01:46:02.560 --> 01:46:07.920
holes? And, and so it launched a wonderful discussion. And, and he's, you know, 82 year old

01:46:07.920 --> 01:46:12.880
guy and he wants to come here and he, and he is coming here on an annual basis. And we talk about

01:46:12.880 --> 01:46:17.120
this and he's open to, and he's done an experimentalist. And I don't think he's in the orthodoxy,

01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:23.120
although he's at a level of renown that you have to take him seriously. And, and so again,

01:46:23.200 --> 01:46:28.000
I just want to say don't tar and feather all physicists because I think there is something.

01:46:28.960 --> 01:46:35.680
Obviously, you know, I'm friends with Stefan. Yeah. I've spoken very highly of Juan of

01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:45.040
Ed Whitton, Ed Whitton, Nima Arkani, Hamed, David Kaplan, the University of Maryland.

01:46:46.240 --> 01:46:52.480
That's not what the problem. The problem has to do with when something goes wrong.

01:46:52.480 --> 01:46:56.240
There's this sort of like, Oh yeah, yeah, that happens all the time happened to me when I was

01:46:56.240 --> 01:47:01.520
a young guy. Like, there's such a lot, it's like being in Nigeria talking about corruption.

01:47:02.480 --> 01:47:10.320
Love people and like people, but it's endemic to the field and it has to do with

01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:17.840
there not being enough resources and not enough success. And my standards are

01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:26.480
very different. Like, you know, if you imagine that you're a hot chick in an office in the 1950s,

01:47:27.680 --> 01:47:31.200
you know, and you're getting patted on your, on your ass when you walk down the hallways,

01:47:31.200 --> 01:47:36.560
and you try to imagine a modern woman having a reaction to that kind of a culture. Yes,

01:47:36.560 --> 01:47:41.920
there are all sorts of things that are normal and supposedly good people for engaging them because

01:47:41.920 --> 01:47:47.200
the norms are all shifted. Well, in a world in which nobody's really apologized for string

01:47:47.200 --> 01:47:51.920
theory, except for maybe Dan Friedan at an appropriate level and all of the, you know,

01:47:52.720 --> 01:47:57.440
things that happened as a result of it. The community is in an unhealthy state. I'm not

01:47:57.440 --> 01:48:03.360
tearing all individuals. I'm trying to say that when this is over, we will look back on a lot of

01:48:03.360 --> 01:48:11.120
this the way we look back on Jeffrey Chu and the bootstrap. This is a very weird period. And for

01:48:11.200 --> 01:48:17.520
some reason, I'm not under its spell. And, you know, people say, well, you know, of course,

01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:23.120
everything was very promising in 1984 with the anomaly cancellation. Well, no, it wasn't. It

01:48:23.120 --> 01:48:27.920
wasn't then. It wasn't in the 90s with the second string theory. I mean, lots of interesting things

01:48:27.920 --> 01:48:34.320
came out of it. But the point is, no, it was always nonsense. It was always crazy. It was always a

01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:40.080
madness. And it had to do with the fact that the field hasn't succeeded. And that too many people

01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:46.320
have concentrated power and that people who had, you know, how would, how would you go up against

01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:52.160
an Ed Whitten and say, actually, even though you're so brilliant, I still think you're wildly off.

01:48:52.160 --> 01:48:58.400
And even though you're so accomplished, I think you're incorrect. These issues or David or Joe

01:48:58.400 --> 01:49:03.440
Polchinski, if you make the argument that everything is string theory after the fact, well,

01:49:04.080 --> 01:49:08.320
can you imagine putting your hard work into something that no matter what you do, they're

01:49:08.320 --> 01:49:13.360
going to claim it and they're telling you ahead of time. All of these things have to do with the

01:49:13.360 --> 01:49:21.520
need to clean up the field. And I just want it to be very clear that I am both its biggest proponent

01:49:21.520 --> 01:49:27.120
and critic. And if you want to think about it as Schrodinger's enthusiast, that's what I am.

01:49:28.960 --> 01:49:34.400
Okay, well, good. I know you're super busy, but I can't resist if you'll indulge me.

01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:38.320
Because it's so rare I get to chat with you and it's so much fun to talk to.

01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:43.440
Brian, I got to tell you, I was thrilled and pleased this punch that you were going to take

01:49:44.160 --> 01:49:52.240
neither a booster approach, nor let's throw, let's, let's, let's teach you a lesson approach.

01:49:52.240 --> 01:49:59.040
So I want to say that there's not a lot I want to put on a jacket for, but this was important.

01:49:59.040 --> 01:50:04.640
Okay, great. Well, I'll, I'll definitely be, be citing that quote on, on repeat to playing it for

01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:06.880
my, my children and friends.

01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:28.880
Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.
