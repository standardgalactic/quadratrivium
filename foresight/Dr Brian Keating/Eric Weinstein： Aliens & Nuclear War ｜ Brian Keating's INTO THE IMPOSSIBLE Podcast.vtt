WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:11.560
Alright, we are live on YouTube. Dr. Brian Keating, Dr. Eric Weinstein, how are you my

00:11.560 --> 00:13.400
friend? I miss you very much.

00:13.400 --> 00:17.400
And I use her. Good to be with you. Is it Cinco de Mayo?

00:17.400 --> 00:22.280
Yes, Feliz Cinco de Mayo. It always comes on the 5th of May, every freaking year. It's

00:22.280 --> 00:23.280
like clockwork.

00:23.280 --> 00:27.080
No, I've decided to celebrate and be festive.

00:27.080 --> 00:29.800
You've got five glasses of tequila like me?

00:29.800 --> 00:35.520
No, I've got the Mexican hat potential on the bottom of my mug.

00:35.520 --> 00:42.800
Well played, sir. Buenos dias to you, my friend. Well, we're going to get in right off the bat.

00:42.800 --> 00:47.680
We're going to talk about the most exciting subjects in your universe. My audience has

00:47.680 --> 00:55.320
missed you as much as I have. And we want to make sure that we kind of give the people

00:55.400 --> 01:00.000
what they're interested in. And that today involves a whole host of issues. We're going

01:00.000 --> 01:04.920
to talk about aliens and a possible new solution to the Fermi Paradox. We're going to talk

01:04.920 --> 01:12.920
about your new and ever-evolving and a good way theories and feelings about cryptocurrencies,

01:12.920 --> 01:19.120
inflation, and so forth. And then we're going to talk about some less controversial subjects

01:19.120 --> 01:24.760
like abortion, Supreme Court leaks, and wherever the day takes it.

01:24.760 --> 01:26.760
How exciting.

01:26.760 --> 01:35.960
Yes, and I was pleased to see recently a man by the name of Musk has kind of taken a new

01:35.960 --> 01:42.800
stance for which he's taking extreme attacks and hostility. And I wondered, Eric, you know,

01:42.800 --> 01:47.440
if he might have a little bit of buyer's remorse right now. Do you feel like this prize, you

01:47.440 --> 01:51.160
know, everyone's always the richest man in the world. That's true. He has five times this

01:51.160 --> 01:57.120
amount. That's true. But, you know, if I, if I, you know, took away your family car, you

01:57.120 --> 02:00.960
would feel it, you know, I would feel it. And so I feel like this is a tremendous amount

02:00.960 --> 02:05.480
of money. And I want to take you back to we started pandemic podcasting together two years

02:05.480 --> 02:11.560
ago, exactly. So, you know, congratulations on our anniversary. But in the in between, there

02:11.560 --> 02:14.960
was this thing called Clubhouse. I don't know if you remember this thing called Clubhouse. And

02:14.960 --> 02:19.000
that was the hottest ticket in the world. Everybody wanted it and get on it. I haven't

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
used it in months. I don't know about you. Like I said, I don't know, you might be on

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
there, but I'm not on there. Do you think he might be having buyer's remorse? He think

02:27.000 --> 02:31.320
he might look back and say this was the clubhouse of 2022. Eventually, and I shouldn't have given

02:31.320 --> 02:35.400
up a quarter of my network.

02:35.400 --> 02:43.040
If there is buyer's remorse, my guess is that it hasn't set in yet. Because I believe that

02:43.280 --> 02:50.440
there's a lot of low hanging fruit to improve Twitter. And, you know, Elon, I don't know

02:50.440 --> 02:58.280
Elon at all. I know tons of people who know him. My impression of him from afar is very

02:58.280 --> 03:05.400
confused. He does seem to be in many ways the world's most forward thinking person. At

03:05.400 --> 03:11.080
least at the level of, you know, forward thinking, what can we what can we actually do? So I'm

03:11.120 --> 03:15.520
pretty impressed with him intellectually as a public intellectual. Then, you know, then

03:15.520 --> 03:21.920
there are layers. Then there's the idea that he has to be chaotic. So he is very Trump-like

03:21.920 --> 03:27.840
in many ways in terms of how he uses Twitter and how he attempts not to be constrained.

03:27.840 --> 03:34.320
Because there are going to be SEC rules and lots of lawyers and PR people telling you

03:34.320 --> 03:38.840
can't say this, you can't do that. And he's decided that he wants to be free. And so there's

03:38.880 --> 03:43.080
this paradox, sort of a laugh or curve, when you have no money and when you have lots of

03:43.080 --> 03:48.240
money, you tend to be in a weird way less free than people with intermediate levels. And so in

03:48.240 --> 03:55.200
a strange way, I sort of see him as a very rich person, choosing to put a lot of his wealth at

03:55.200 --> 04:01.280
risk so that he can be free. And that too is very forward thinking. Now, what I know about

04:01.280 --> 04:08.080
Twitter is that current Twitter has all sorts of obviously soluble problems in terms of you can

04:08.120 --> 04:15.160
just fire a bunch of people and you can make rules about algorithmic transparency and the

04:15.160 --> 04:21.440
like. And then when you get to the end of plucking all the low-hanging fruit, then you've got the

04:21.440 --> 04:29.720
problem of the underlying technology allows any person to post something instantly. And you

04:29.720 --> 04:35.160
know, what we've seen is we've seen first-person shooters looking like they come out of a video

04:35.200 --> 04:42.880
game in the Christchurch Mosque Massacre that was, I think, streamed live on Facebook. So the

04:42.880 --> 04:50.440
problem is us. It's not Twitter. It's not the technology. It's the technology hooked up. Lots

04:50.440 --> 05:00.400
of people, many of whom have mental health issues, many of whom are incredibly chaotic, talking

05:00.440 --> 05:05.560
to each other without common background, without an ability to, you know, to know who's going to

05:05.560 --> 05:14.560
post what when. So in that world, I don't think there's a solution. So, you know, the great

05:14.560 --> 05:23.960
danger is that he's bought something and he's got the first 17 fixes lined up. And I don't think

05:23.960 --> 05:28.240
the problem is going to occur then. I think the problem is going to occur once you fixed all of

05:28.240 --> 05:34.800
those things. What are you left with? And you know, one of the things he's signaled, Brian, is that

05:34.800 --> 05:43.200
he believes that removing anonymity will be a large portion of the solution. And I do think it

05:43.200 --> 05:51.440
will do a lot to solve the problems. But there's a hard core of people who are happy to be known,

05:52.440 --> 06:00.080
who are incredibly abusive, and think it's funny. And then there's a very large market for abuse. And

06:00.080 --> 06:06.080
I think people haven't really realized that abuse tends to be one of the most important products

06:06.080 --> 06:12.440
that the internet knows how to distribute. And because you can't sign up for abuse, you can't

06:12.440 --> 06:17.200
say, hey, I want to see who's abusing who today. I'm feeling like I should abuse somebody else. I'm

06:17.200 --> 06:24.440
not feeling so good about myself. When you do that, you realize you can't be honest, that you're

06:24.440 --> 06:29.080
really up for going to the Coliseum to see people get hurt. You're really starting to say, oh, no,

06:29.080 --> 06:36.480
no, no. I'm here for the comedy. It's just comedy. It's just fun. It's just laughs. Or I think this

06:36.480 --> 06:43.120
makes the world a better place. I'm calling people out who are ghoulish and horrible. Well, no,

06:43.360 --> 06:49.200
you're really just up for abuse. And you don't have many ideas and your life is empty. And that's

06:49.200 --> 06:56.240
what you're doing. Okay, that problem of all sorts of people selling this one product that has an

06:56.240 --> 07:04.040
enormous audience for it is going to plague Twitter. So I think that there is buyer's remorse. But I

07:04.040 --> 07:10.200
think Elon can go make more money. What he's trying to do is he's trying to say, we have to have some

07:10.240 --> 07:17.920
property that isn't in control under the, how do I say this? You have to have some major property

07:18.560 --> 07:28.960
that isn't under the control of whatever this wrong woke thing is. And, you know, you have Fox,

07:29.040 --> 07:43.440
you have, I don't know, Newsmax, but these are not major, you know, even the blaze or the daily wire

07:43.480 --> 07:52.000
or daily collar, any of these things, I think, they're not like MSNBC, New York Times, NPR, and the

07:52.000 --> 08:01.240
fact that all of these sort of formally, formally, respectable properties gone completely insane,

08:02.640 --> 08:11.080
haven't broken rank, buying one, and saying, hey, we're not going to change the logo, and we're not

08:11.080 --> 08:17.840
going to change the mast, the mast head completely. But what we are going to do is we are going to

08:17.840 --> 08:24.360
stop making it possible to be ridiculous in this coordinated assault on reality. Now, that's why

08:24.360 --> 08:33.600
everybody on the, it's not the left, Brian, it's like the, it's some sort of a partnership between

08:33.600 --> 08:42.760
the establishment left and their revolutionary army that they deploy to try to undo everything that

08:42.760 --> 08:46.640
gets in the, in the path of what I would call the rent seeking elite who are in control of the

08:46.640 --> 08:54.840
Democratic Party. That, that thing, he's taking that on. And I think you have to look at it. He's

08:54.840 --> 08:59.920
not taking it on necessarily from being a conservative. He's taking it on from saying, I

08:59.920 --> 09:02.360
can't live under these people one second longer.

09:04.080 --> 09:09.800
Yeah. And, you know, I think, looking back at, you know, the history of these platforms, I mean, we

09:09.800 --> 09:15.920
see Facebook kind of falling out of favor. And we saw the massive contributions in the previous

09:15.960 --> 09:22.200
election, election by Zuckerberg, which didn't curry him any favor with the people that obviously he

09:22.200 --> 09:26.880
was advocating for. So I wonder, you know, in this, and I wonder if you saw any of the interviews

09:26.880 --> 09:33.440
that Zuckerberg's been on this, you know, kind of world tour lately on Lex's show and on another

09:33.440 --> 09:40.960
podcast, Tim Ferriss. And no one's really asking him, you know, these really tough questions. So I

09:40.960 --> 09:46.360
wonder, you know, is it, is it really true that we look to these, we look to these people as if

09:46.360 --> 09:52.240
they're so lucky to have the resources to buy this? It seems to me like a nightmare hellscape to

09:52.240 --> 09:57.000
wake up in the morning and have a New York Times hit piece like Elon faces today with his South

09:57.000 --> 10:01.320
African childhood brought into play as if he had choices to where he was born.

10:02.000 --> 10:02.440
Geez.

10:03.040 --> 10:09.160
I just, why don't you just call everything white supremacist? You know, just just get it over

10:09.200 --> 10:14.720
with everybody's a Nazi. Everybody's always why they just waste our time because the New York

10:14.720 --> 10:21.640
Times used to be an important newspaper and, and still capable of doing things. We all have to

10:21.640 --> 10:29.360
have a discussion framed by them. And my feeling is, okay, let's just take some random person, you

10:29.360 --> 10:34.640
know, let's take just give me a generic Republican.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.080
Marco Rubio.

10:38.800 --> 10:44.560
Okay, Marco Rubio. Is there any truth to the fact that he was connected to the Cuban Cuban mafia?

10:46.320 --> 10:52.040
Okay, now we're going to discuss Marco Rubio being connected to the Cuban mafia for no reason other

10:52.040 --> 10:57.560
than the fact that somebody was able to put that question in a sentence at the top of an article.

10:57.680 --> 11:05.640
So my feeling is we can also, why does Marco Rubio seemingly target America's children? Oh, is he

11:05.680 --> 11:09.920
targeting America's children? Like we just changed from the Cuban mafia to some different story.

11:12.520 --> 11:19.880
I think we've got to just stop, start with the idea of shut up. Like, you know, if you don't have

11:19.880 --> 11:21.520
much hush,

11:23.040 --> 11:27.800
that's where I feel like, you know, this, this takeover of Twitter, he took over something, which is

11:27.800 --> 11:33.280
built by people that had an ideological bent against him and have a very clear perspective on what

11:33.280 --> 11:38.400
they want to promote and what they don't want to promote and, and highlight versus not. And I feel

11:38.400 --> 11:43.840
like, again, I feel like it's like a booby prize. I do feel like at some point, even I or you, you

11:43.840 --> 11:49.720
know, would wake up and just say, you know, like, there's so much richness in the world. Like, who

11:49.720 --> 11:53.760
cares to have these battles with people that only get points, the more polarized that they speak, the

11:53.760 --> 11:58.880
more they try to punch up and take down Eric Weinstein, I get, I get like those Dungeons, remember

11:58.920 --> 12:02.960
the Dungeons and Dragons, you know, hit points. If I take Eric's car, you know, I get your hit

12:02.960 --> 12:08.560
points. Well, you've got 690,000 people that fall. Oh, I've only got two. Who gives a fricking

12:08.560 --> 12:14.760
crap? You know, I mean, all these people do remarkably well and without it. And I feel like he's

12:14.760 --> 12:20.160
catering to this tribe of maybe 100,000 semi woke, you know, if you want to call it that,

12:20.280 --> 12:25.240
journalists, people in the Beltway and the corridor in the Northeast and then the West Coast. And why

12:25.240 --> 12:29.720
do you want to spend so much of your money? I mean, again, it's a fifth Brian, Brian, I don't know

12:29.720 --> 12:35.160
what you're asking about. The key issue is we've got to buy one of these things. There has to be a

12:35.160 --> 12:40.800
university that's actually a university, a news service that's actually a news service, a place, a

12:40.800 --> 12:47.080
public square that's a public square. Like, we've lost everything, essentially. And then there's

12:47.080 --> 12:52.920
these false equivalent. Oh, no, no, no, Fox. It's like, look, Fox, I still treat as right wing

12:52.920 --> 13:02.160
propaganda. The major issue is that left leaning properties went insane, as opposed to merely

13:02.160 --> 13:09.800
biased. And, you know, like, there's one of these things with, Hey, remember, we told you that

13:09.800 --> 13:14.960
Ivermectin was horse dewormer that you shouldn't take it? Well, it turns out that if we lose Roe

13:14.960 --> 13:24.160
V. Wade, a horse ulcer medication can be used to induce off label of spontaneous abortions in

13:24.160 --> 13:30.640
humans. So just go to your vet, you're covered. And I'm thinking, Okay, I really appreciate that.

13:30.640 --> 13:35.480
What you're really doing is telling me that you have the right to contradict yourselves and the

13:35.480 --> 13:41.560
rest of us are all hypocrites for simply trying to get through a day, but you have an absolute right

13:42.160 --> 13:49.320
to say whatever you want, whenever you want. That it's a game. And I have to admit, I have caught

13:49.320 --> 13:54.400
people chuckling, like, Hey, did you see what I just put out today? That'll bend their minds because

13:54.400 --> 13:59.320
it contradicts what I said three weeks ago. You're just thinking, Okay, I get it. Everybody's

13:59.320 --> 14:04.840
joyriding. Right. Yeah, right. You get those, I get those adrenaline bumps. And then speaking of

14:04.840 --> 14:09.240
that, you know, this, this thing, I don't know if the deal is actually done or what it is. But in

14:09.240 --> 14:13.880
obviously a lot of it was leaked ahead of time and so forth. And, and you have this like, it's

14:13.880 --> 14:18.520
like the fifth estate now. So, so you have the fourth estate, which is media. And then there's

14:18.520 --> 14:24.280
like this, this leakage class, you know, the people beyond the, beyond the curtain that will

14:24.280 --> 14:29.240
leak the story that eventually does get pipeline directly into the mainstream veins of, of the

14:29.240 --> 14:33.680
fourth estate of journalism. And what do you make of this? I mean, this people are celebrating as

14:33.680 --> 14:38.960
heroes. This leak, you know, to the, to the, from the Supreme Court decision, which, as I

14:38.960 --> 14:43.440
understand it, could put people's lives in danger, right? I don't want to be too specific. But this,

14:43.440 --> 14:49.440
this, this thing has not set a law yet. And regardless of how you feel about it, and I can

14:49.440 --> 14:54.400
hear opinions on both sides. Before I actually, before I get to that, Eric, about two years ago

14:54.400 --> 14:59.280
on the portal, you did this wonderful kind of verbal essay, and everybody's asking when the

14:59.280 --> 15:04.320
portal is going to come back. I hope it'll be soon. No questions asked about that today. But

15:04.880 --> 15:10.000
you did a, you did a wonderful verbal essay in which you talked about the trouble with ambiguity.

15:10.560 --> 15:15.760
And you talked about superpositions and how inharmonious they are for the human mind. And the

15:15.760 --> 15:20.720
human mind hates ambiguity and loves resolution, even if the resolution's wrong. And you talked

15:20.720 --> 15:25.440
about abortion, you talked about gun control. I wonder, could you recapitulate that discussion?

15:25.520 --> 15:31.120
It was in the context of, you know, kind of a Schrodinger state of a baby being real versus

15:31.120 --> 15:36.000
not. Have you changed your opinions? And can you first recap? Can you recount that, that,

15:36.000 --> 15:41.120
that wonderful kind of analogy that you used? Well, yeah, of course, I should listen to the

15:41.120 --> 15:45.360
portal and find out what I, what I said or thought. You know, my usual,

15:45.360 --> 15:49.200
just bring your own words on you. You remember that Charles Barkley said he was, he was taken

15:49.200 --> 15:56.880
out of context in his own autobiography. So we're not in that company. Well, you know, the famous

15:59.600 --> 16:04.240
description of one of my favorite classical music pieces, St. Saint-San second piano concerto,

16:04.240 --> 16:10.320
is that it begins with Bach and ends with often Bach. And conception, you know, it begins

16:11.840 --> 16:15.440
when you're talking about terminating a pregnancy, it sort of begins with

16:15.520 --> 16:22.560
spermicide and ends in infanticide. And anything that has that property of being on a continuum

16:22.560 --> 16:28.720
that connects something incredibly trivial to something unthinkable, but naturally, you know,

16:28.720 --> 16:35.040
through the intermediate value theorem, there's got to be some point where that thing becomes

16:35.760 --> 16:44.400
a meaningful life. And the political expediency has said, we're going to turn this into an

16:44.400 --> 16:50.640
intellectual football, right? And so one side is going to pretend that something is a baby,

16:50.640 --> 16:59.280
the instant the sperm nudge is close to the egg. And somebody else is going to pretend that it's

16:59.280 --> 17:08.320
just the mother's body four seconds before delivery. Okay, well, there's a black hole

17:08.320 --> 17:13.040
that I don't want to get into, because what they're really saying is we know that we've

17:13.040 --> 17:19.120
got to make this wrong statement in order to get where we need to go. And if you won't make the

17:19.120 --> 17:25.360
wrong statement with us, you're Hitler. It's like, okay, so add Hitler to white supremacists.

17:25.360 --> 17:31.280
It's just, look, Brian, this is all so dumb. It's so innervating. I mean, the real issue is we

17:31.280 --> 17:37.440
should go back to reading Griswold, you know, before row, where we get the penumbra argument.

17:37.440 --> 17:41.840
I think it's advanced by William O. Douglas in the Warren Court. And we should ask ourselves,

17:41.840 --> 17:46.640
how sophisticated is that decision? And then, you know, the issue with row,

17:47.520 --> 17:54.000
of course, is that for its time, there was no plan B. Back in that day, the world was a very

17:54.000 --> 17:58.640
different place. You know, there are arguments in all different directions. I don't want to get

17:58.640 --> 18:06.960
into any of that, because the issue, you know, suffice it to say, I behave pretty much as a

18:06.960 --> 18:12.640
pro-choice person early on in the pregnancy. And I've, you know, protested in the streets

18:13.280 --> 18:20.960
in order to make sure that women have safe legal access to disposing of their pregnancies early

18:20.960 --> 18:30.480
on. And I'm pretty pro-baby's rights right before, you know, somebody's about to give birth. And

18:30.800 --> 18:37.200
they can't go to anybody's party. Yeah, I mean, I remember my dad of a blessed memory. He used

18:37.200 --> 18:43.840
to joke, you know, on my 33rd birthday, he said, I believe in abortion up until the 99th trimester.

18:43.840 --> 18:50.400
And, you know, but now it's not a joke. I mean, you have people that are effectively saying,

18:50.400 --> 18:55.360
you know, such things as, you know, a pregnant person, of course, we have to be respectful.

18:55.360 --> 18:59.920
It's amazing how we went from we can't define what a woman is with regard to the Supreme Court.

19:00.560 --> 19:09.360
The media stuff. I value your time and my time. And we can get into like, trans, what are they

19:09.360 --> 19:15.600
thinking? Or do you know what someone's always been accused of next? And my feeling is, this is my

19:15.600 --> 19:20.640
only time on this planet. And I have, you know, an esteemed physicist colleague, a worldly guy.

19:21.520 --> 19:27.280
I don't want to talk about any of the ridiculously stupid stuff that everybody wants us to talk about.

19:27.600 --> 19:31.840
All right. Well, thanks for joining the Into the Impossible podcast.

19:31.840 --> 19:35.840
It's been a pleasure. And please like comment and subscribe.

19:37.040 --> 19:42.720
Women get pregnant and give birth. And we should call some number of biological men, women, I think,

19:43.680 --> 19:48.880
because there is a programming issue, but this has gotten out of hand. And I'm not going to sort

19:48.880 --> 19:53.120
it out with you on this particular program. And we haven't lost our mind. And I'm not going to throw

19:53.120 --> 20:04.960
biology out the window because, you know, Renee Richards is upset. We have to be compassionate

20:05.680 --> 20:11.760
and deal with everybody in our society. We should be kind. And we can't lose our minds at the same

20:11.760 --> 20:17.600
time. And we failed. And we failed to have these discussions. We failed to talk about the reality

20:17.600 --> 20:22.560
of pregnancy. We won't sit down with Carnegie Stages and embryonic development and say,

20:22.560 --> 20:27.840
when does the neural tube and the neural crest form? And what is the richness of neural activity

20:27.840 --> 20:33.920
and all these kinds of things that matter to me? Instead, we're going to try to talk to each other.

20:33.920 --> 20:37.920
Pro-life, no, pro-choice, no, pro-life. Let's let somebody else do it.

20:39.680 --> 20:42.640
All right. Well, let's pivot to another existential crisis.

20:42.640 --> 20:45.280
Well, no, no. I'm going to get to the leak.

20:45.280 --> 20:48.000
All right. Yes. I want to talk about the leak. Okay. Let's go back to that. Yeah.

20:48.400 --> 20:55.920
I think it's important. I just had a conversation with somebody I've known very long time as a

20:55.920 --> 21:02.080
lawyer last night. And the lawyer said, you know, it's wrong to leak. And I probably would have

21:02.080 --> 21:09.520
considered it. And I said, why? Oh, because I think it's so important that women have

21:09.520 --> 21:13.600
access to reproductive rights that even the unthinkable should be done.

21:13.600 --> 21:28.240
Okay. I appreciated the candor. I think that's insane. I mean, I think that what's really

21:28.240 --> 21:36.400
becoming very clear is that very few of us trust democracy, trust the court, trust our scientists.

21:36.400 --> 21:46.320
The level of loss of trust has led to a large number of us unwilling to carry the culture

21:47.680 --> 21:52.080
of the United States that animates the Constitution and its other governing document.

21:52.800 --> 21:59.040
I think this is something I don't know how to communicate. If you don't carry the culture

21:59.040 --> 22:03.520
of the United States, which is that you're willing to believe in a fiction that nine

22:03.600 --> 22:10.320
druids can discern the meaning of the Constitution and legal conflict, which is, I'm going to say it

22:10.320 --> 22:19.680
right here. It's a fiction. But I agree to that fiction. I agree to the fiction that a majority

22:19.680 --> 22:25.440
of the electoral college or one day maybe the electorate has the wisdom, the best wisdom available

22:25.440 --> 22:32.240
to choose the president, blah, blah, blah. I think many of us have decided that they don't feel,

22:32.320 --> 22:37.520
we don't feel like carrying the culture. And without the culture, it's a piece of parchment

22:37.520 --> 22:43.280
with ink. There's nothing more. If you can't animate the document, if you're unwilling

22:44.160 --> 22:48.880
to pretend to believe in the things that are necessary to keep the experiment running, because

22:48.880 --> 22:55.040
it's like, no, with Merrick Garland, that's out the window. No, with Bork. It's ridiculous. No,

22:55.040 --> 22:59.280
no, no, you don't understand. The activism on the Warren court destroyed the... Okay. Look,

23:00.000 --> 23:05.280
I know all of the right-wing complaints about the left and the judiciary, and I know all of the

23:05.280 --> 23:12.080
complaints in reverse. And there's two separate stories. And I'm like, I feel like I'm the middle

23:12.080 --> 23:16.640
child. It's like, you idiots are going to lose us everything. Oh, you want to pack the court? Oh,

23:16.640 --> 23:23.120
you want to do this? Okay. No fellow buster. Right. We're not going to survive this, you morons.

23:23.680 --> 23:28.960
And, you know, my feeling about this is my desire to watch Joe Biden, Donald Trump,

23:31.200 --> 23:37.120
all of these, these people are not going to be around for that long. My kids have a lot of

23:37.120 --> 23:44.480
runtime left. I just worry that what we haven't realized is that a giant chunk of both parties

23:44.480 --> 23:47.200
have gone revolutionary. They don't believe in the country.

23:47.440 --> 23:54.800
How does that bode for the remainder of the union of these states then?

23:58.480 --> 24:05.520
I think we don't realize what we're doing. You know, I have this memory of being on a school bus

24:05.520 --> 24:13.920
when I was a little kid and figuring out that if I could get the kids to sway back and forth

24:13.920 --> 24:22.480
in unison, we could actually have a large effect in aggregate. And we started swaying the bus,

24:22.480 --> 24:27.760
and the bus was really like rocking at some incredible level, just from all of these kids

24:27.760 --> 24:31.040
going back and forth. And once they figured out that this was real, they got more and more

24:31.040 --> 24:38.000
enthusiastic. And it felt like we were pretty close to being in danger of actually getting the

24:38.000 --> 24:45.280
bus to do something it wasn't supposed to do. Now, I feel like that's what we're doing,

24:45.280 --> 24:49.520
is that we have this idea that the bus represents like adulthood. There's nothing you can do to

24:49.520 --> 24:55.280
take down the United States of America. It's some super stable superpower. You can mouth off. It's

24:55.280 --> 25:01.840
not true. We are now in danger of disassembling this beautiful experiment because we're bored.

25:02.800 --> 25:08.160
And we're like mischievous, and we want to have fun. So maybe we'll riot the streets this summer.

25:08.160 --> 25:14.080
Summer is coming up. There's always a good idea to have mostly peaceful gatherings, and we can

25:15.360 --> 25:19.840
call each other names and bring some guns, and then we can discuss who shot whom.

25:22.720 --> 25:28.560
I think you've got more kids than I can remember. You probably have the same

25:28.560 --> 25:32.480
number as the last time we spoke, but I'm not even positive of that. No abortions.

25:35.440 --> 25:41.120
In Maurice Sendix, where the wild things are, he says, let the wild rumpus start.

25:42.400 --> 25:55.040
Yeah. I think that's the wild rumpus. Yeah, exactly. Since we talked last in late December,

25:56.000 --> 26:03.520
we did record about a month ago. We may release that at some point. But we've had this existential

26:03.520 --> 26:13.440
crisis looming in Eastern Europe. And I wonder if we can kind of think about that. That rumpus

26:13.440 --> 26:17.680
governed by the same clan of people you just talked about with the addition of somebody who

26:17.680 --> 26:23.600
brings the average age of the discussants down slightly closer to 70, the Vladimir Putin,

26:24.240 --> 26:30.320
who I understand he's not well. I believe he is undergoing some surgery, so I don't know if

26:30.320 --> 26:38.080
people are going to send thoughts and prayers to that particular individual. But now things are

26:38.080 --> 26:42.800
getting serious. And I remember not too long ago, you advocated for something, and I was like,

26:42.800 --> 26:49.680
he can't be serious. My God, he can't be serious. And that was for a demonstration event of the

26:49.680 --> 26:57.440
awesomeness of the release of the binding energy between nucleons. And that was a call to

26:58.480 --> 27:04.800
a demonstration of the fearful power of the wildest rumpus of all, which is nuclear or

27:04.800 --> 27:12.080
thermonuclear weapons. And you advocated for a non-radioactive but still thermonuclear

27:13.200 --> 27:19.200
detonation, so to speak, of the kind that we could witness, obviously not on catastrophic

27:19.200 --> 27:24.160
scale. But I wonder what was, at first I was shocked. I thought, Eric's being a provocative

27:24.160 --> 27:29.200
tour. What's the thinking behind that? What would that do for humanity to see such a thing?

27:29.200 --> 27:37.920
You can see for yourself, we've lost our fear of the sun. We can create what the sun does on earth,

27:40.640 --> 27:42.000
and we're not afraid of it anymore.

27:42.160 --> 27:52.880
Look, I can't easily talk about Ukraine at the moment, because I am so isolated from the rest

27:52.880 --> 28:02.800
of you all. If I start talking about this, it becomes very clear that we're distracting

28:02.800 --> 28:08.240
ourselves with everything else. And so I understand that we've decided to distract ourselves, to not

28:08.240 --> 28:15.360
take this seriously, to trifle with Armageddon, and to have fun with it. We've got a handsome Jewish

28:15.360 --> 28:19.440
guy who loves his wife with one of the great lines of all time.

28:22.960 --> 28:27.600
You know what the line is? I need ammunition, not a ride.

28:29.680 --> 28:33.600
Right? And so it's like, oh my god, nobody's, nobody's ever done anything that masculine,

28:33.600 --> 28:38.080
and I'm kind of excited. It's like, okay, so now we're going to have a planet that is

28:38.080 --> 28:44.560
coked up on the testosterone, testosterone of Ukraine's head of state,

28:46.240 --> 28:55.680
and we're going to trifle with Armageddon as if this is fun, or okay, or hey, let's redo the

28:55.680 --> 29:03.440
early part of the 20th century before we had the nuclear weapon. And my assessment is that

29:04.400 --> 29:09.360
it is more likely that you are all sane, and that I am insane because of the odds.

29:11.040 --> 29:16.160
But I think it's the reverse. I think when I called for a return to above-ground nuclear testing,

29:16.160 --> 29:23.520
I saw that the Cold War wasn't over. And I saw a world of people whose brains have been restructured

29:23.520 --> 29:28.560
by their phone. Like, I'll just give you something from Miami. I was in Miami. Was it a wonderful

29:28.560 --> 29:34.640
dinner? Very successful guy picked up the tab. But when the topic came up, he said, you know,

29:34.640 --> 29:39.120
the thing about all-out nuclear war is I'm not really worried about all-out nuclear war. I'm

29:39.120 --> 29:46.880
worried about re-establishing credibility in the markets afterwards. And I thought, got it.

29:46.880 --> 29:56.560
But we're not, I'm not in the same conversation. So I think that to be blunt about it, I've gone

29:56.560 --> 30:03.200
crazy. And I'm telling you how important above-ground nuclear testing with radiation,

30:06.800 --> 30:12.720
you know, a lot of the radiation, the permanent radiation comes from the, I guess, the fission

30:12.720 --> 30:19.840
reaction that is turned into the fusion reaction, thanks to the geometry of Teller and Ulam. And

30:21.040 --> 30:29.200
I think that it is a question of self-preservation. I think you cannot have this many people completely.

30:33.520 --> 30:39.280
I've gone crazy. I believe that we are trifling with Armageddon. And if we get onto this topic,

30:39.280 --> 30:45.280
I will just sound like the most unbalanced person you've heard.

30:45.280 --> 30:53.040
Well, I don't think so. And here's the reason why. If we look at the writings of our mutual friend,

30:53.040 --> 30:59.920
David Kaiser, the Girmenschenhausen Professor at MIT of Science Technology Studies, a good friend,

31:00.560 --> 31:05.600
truly a wonderful individual, he wrote a book about the quantum legacy, I think it's called.

31:05.600 --> 31:11.280
And it's about kind of twin nuclei in your language, but more not the biological nuclei,

31:11.280 --> 31:18.400
but sort of the contemporaneous development of nuclear weapons of space travel and of the

31:18.400 --> 31:24.000
interest in aliens and events like Roswell and so forth, that that wasn't coincidental, that they

31:24.000 --> 31:30.720
were all sort of synergistically related, and it wasn't purely serendipitous. And his claim,

31:30.720 --> 31:39.120
I think is now being taken up as one of the possible explanations of Fermi's Paradox.

31:39.120 --> 31:43.840
So I'm going to ask you first to define Fermi's Paradox, and then I'm going to read this paper,

31:43.840 --> 31:48.080
which is behind a paywall, but I'm going to give value to my audience. So on this channel,

31:48.080 --> 31:54.720
we do nothing if not give value. And this is going to be a website, which you will thank me for in

31:54.720 --> 31:59.760
your dreams, and it gets you over paywalls. I will reveal that in just a minute. So stay

31:59.760 --> 32:04.000
tuned for that. That's what we call foreshadowing in the business area. First of all, what is the

32:04.000 --> 32:11.040
Fermi Paradox? Is it significant? Does it rise to the level of the Twin Paradox, of the Xenos

32:11.040 --> 32:17.040
Paradox, or is it merely a stepping stone into a bigger series of questions? Fermi Paradox, please.

32:18.800 --> 32:22.160
Well, I would rather hear it from an astrophysicist than...

32:22.160 --> 32:27.280
Fine. There happens to be one right here. So Fermi did the calculation even back in the 50s of how

32:27.280 --> 32:34.080
many stars there were, how likely it was to have life in other planets, sort of precursor to what's

32:34.080 --> 32:39.040
called the Drake equation, and he came up with this estimate based on the very large number of stars

32:39.040 --> 32:44.000
known in the Milky Way galaxy, even at that point, not taking into account galaxies outside of the

32:44.000 --> 32:50.880
Milky Way. And he said the overwhelming odds are that there are other civilizations, other aliens,

32:51.520 --> 32:56.640
and so he asked one of these questions after the calculations that he was famous for, the so-called

32:56.640 --> 33:02.800
Fermi calculations. He said, where are they? If the odds are, there's tremendous numbers of these

33:02.800 --> 33:08.080
civilizations of advanced extraterrestrial technology, capable species, not slime mold.

33:09.520 --> 33:14.720
Oh, by the way, Eric, I wanted to ask this of my friends on Twitter, but I'm too scared to ask

33:14.720 --> 33:20.160
it, so I'll ask it of you. If we found an embryo, like a human fetus, let's say it's a three-month

33:20.160 --> 33:25.840
development gestation, and it's on the planet, you know, Procyon B, you know, Trappist 1,

33:26.880 --> 33:32.240
what do you think the community of astronomers would do? I mean, would they say, ah, it's nothing,

33:32.240 --> 33:38.320
you know, let's abort it? I mean, is that an interesting litmus test to you of how we would

33:38.320 --> 33:42.640
react if we saw a fetus? Whatever age you want to say, 10 days, 20 days, it has a heartbeat,

33:42.640 --> 33:47.920
it's just sitting there on some planet in some exosolar planet. Is that relevant to the conversation

33:47.920 --> 33:56.400
of abortion at all? I don't even know. It's like a Boltzmann brain, but it's a Boltzmann fetus.

33:56.400 --> 34:04.880
Boltzmann fetus. Okay. Whatever you're smoking, you've not sent me any of it. I did see an enormous

34:04.880 --> 34:11.520
mushroom the other day on your channel, and this is an exciting new direction for middle-aged.

34:11.600 --> 34:19.520
Never lick the mushroom. Never lick the mushroom. Okay. Look, we seem to be very afraid to believe,

34:21.520 --> 34:30.240
and, you know, let me just get over the hump. I don't believe we're the only life in the universe.

34:30.240 --> 34:38.880
I don't know how common or how rare it is. I don't know whether or not there are ways of

34:39.520 --> 34:45.840
evading. I don't know whether Einstein's restrictions passed through to all successor theories to

34:45.840 --> 34:53.040
relativity. You know, Einstein may have done something to Newton, but he didn't do everything

34:53.040 --> 35:02.640
to Newton's conservation law, if you know properly understood. So we don't know what the source of

35:02.720 --> 35:09.200
our apparent aloneness is, but apparent may be doing a fair amount of heavy lifting,

35:10.880 --> 35:16.880
and what I've offered up is the Fermi Paradox that I know. The only Fermi Paradox that I know

35:16.880 --> 35:23.920
is the one on North Sentinel Island in the Andaman chain, because the islanders are effectively

35:23.920 --> 35:29.040
Indians, but they don't know that they're Indians. They may not even know that India exists or that

35:29.040 --> 35:37.360
India claims North Sentinel Island or that it won't let anyone land there. And my other claim

35:37.360 --> 35:48.400
is that I believe that a good chunk of humanity has stumbled into a very appealing wrong idea.

35:48.400 --> 35:54.240
So first I want to talk about the appeal of the wrong idea. The wrong idea is the more we find

35:54.320 --> 36:00.160
out, the more we realize how little we understand. There's something like really comforting about

36:00.160 --> 36:08.000
this. And imagine that you apply this generally. The longer I'm in love, the more I realize how

36:08.000 --> 36:13.280
little I understand about the human heart. Oh, that's beautiful. But then you apply it to real

36:13.280 --> 36:20.640
things. The longer I study continental exploration, the more I realize that every new land mass

36:21.440 --> 36:26.000
we find on Earth is just an indication of how many land masses we have yet to find.

36:26.720 --> 36:32.160
That's like the dumbest thing you could possibly say, but it has the same basic feeling. Well,

36:32.160 --> 36:40.160
I think we're almost at the end. I think we are afraid to say something which has always been

36:40.160 --> 36:46.160
false in the past. Now, the thing is, we're almost at the end of the rules of physics.

36:46.720 --> 36:54.080
When somebody says that, everyone says, yeah, Lord Kelvin said that they thought that that was true

36:54.080 --> 36:58.320
when they had the proton and the electron. And then they found the neutron. Okay. Well,

36:59.680 --> 37:04.560
yes. And it was always true that powered human flight was never going to happen because it had

37:04.560 --> 37:09.840
never happened until it happened. And it was the same thing. You know, there's this land mass off

37:09.840 --> 37:15.680
of Siberia that I think was discovered in the 20th century, which is the last major land mass to be

37:15.680 --> 37:24.640
found. Nobody's worried about the idea that there are uncharted desert isles on Earth because we

37:24.640 --> 37:30.720
have the satellite there. We're about at the end of physics, I think. Now, that could be wrong.

37:31.600 --> 37:36.800
The easiest way for it to be wrong is that we would be at the end of this chapter,

37:36.800 --> 37:40.240
but it would be a book with many chapters and you have to finish this chapter to know that there

37:40.240 --> 37:47.280
are chapters to follow. Okay. What if for the moment, I take the contrarian position and say,

37:47.280 --> 37:53.120
no, no, no, I think this is about to wrap up. And the really weird thing is that it's taken

37:54.000 --> 38:05.040
from 1945 until the present for us to get close. That's a the blink of an eye in cosmic time.

38:05.760 --> 38:10.160
But my belief is, is that if anything is monitoring us, and if I'm not wrong,

38:12.080 --> 38:18.080
right before you have the full power of the laws of physics, you let off a nuke.

38:19.200 --> 38:24.160
And then you go from fission to fusion. And so the concern that I have is, first of all,

38:24.160 --> 38:30.080
that the Fermi paradox on North Sentinel Island is the same as the Fermi paradox we have here on

38:30.080 --> 38:35.200
Earth, where we are in the North Sentinelese, and we're trying to guess that India exists.

38:36.560 --> 38:42.400
So my question to you is, first of all, is there some sort of a thing that doesn't want us

38:42.400 --> 38:49.680
contacted that is shielding us the way India shields North Sentinel Island? And is it the case

38:49.680 --> 38:54.640
that whatever it is, is, you know, while we think, oh, well, geez, Sam Harris, my friend, said,

38:55.520 --> 39:01.600
whoever is out there must be, you know, millions of years and more advanced. They would view us as

39:01.600 --> 39:16.160
aphids, nonsense. There is probably a level of sophistication where it kind of taps out.

39:17.360 --> 39:21.360
And, you know, you can build bigger and bigger computers, but you're not going to discover

39:21.440 --> 39:25.360
more land masses on Earth, and I don't know that you're going to discover more laws of physics.

39:26.240 --> 39:32.160
I'm concerned, quite honestly, that we've lost our fear of the cosmos, just the way we've lost

39:32.160 --> 39:37.360
our fear of nukes. We've become relatively certain that nothing ever happens here, that we won't be

39:37.360 --> 39:46.000
visited, that there's nothing else other than us. And I'm worried that what we did is we alerted

39:46.000 --> 39:50.720
whatever is out there, hey, we're just about at the end, and we haven't worked out our stuff,

39:50.720 --> 39:55.120
and we're going to be able to get off this rock if you are able to get off this rock.

39:55.680 --> 40:01.280
I mean, to come visit this rock, rather. So if things can visit us, we can leave.

40:02.880 --> 40:06.320
Now, it may be that all the planets are, you know, rushing away from each other

40:07.120 --> 40:13.840
because of the expansion of the metric of space-like splices in the universe. But

40:14.640 --> 40:24.960
if the next theory has the power to get us really far, really easily, and far might be,

40:24.960 --> 40:33.600
in many dimensions, not all of them spatial, I would be very worried that whatever is watching us

40:34.400 --> 40:35.440
knows how close we are.

40:37.840 --> 40:43.280
So, I mean, we have to admit the mastodon in the room is that we have no evidence.

40:43.280 --> 40:50.160
There's life elsewhere. I stole that from Sir Roger Penrose. And we hear this, Lee Cronin,

40:50.160 --> 40:57.200
and my friend, Sarah Walker, they were just on Lex, and they're talking very, very specifically

40:57.200 --> 41:01.360
about the traits and characteristics of these aliens, and what they're going to be like,

41:01.360 --> 41:05.120
and how you can calculate exactly how much structure went into them, and how you could

41:05.120 --> 41:10.800
detect them, and it's all very interesting, and it's rooted in sound, chemical, and physical

41:10.800 --> 41:17.440
reasoning. But there's still this huge, you know, lacuna, which is that there's zero evidence. And

41:17.440 --> 41:22.480
in fact, I want to try, I want to try something out on you, an argument that I have, which will

41:22.480 --> 41:29.440
sound dirty, but it's not, and you know it's not. And it's called panspermia, panspermia, okay.

41:29.440 --> 41:35.760
Now, it sounds dirty, but it involves the exchange of material between planets in our solar system

41:35.760 --> 41:41.440
and other solar systems, perhaps. And you talked to Avi Loeb, our mutual friend,

41:42.080 --> 41:49.680
not too long ago in Miami also, while he was down there with you. And he talked about the

41:50.400 --> 41:56.000
almost, you know, definite admission by the U.S. government that an extraterrestrial meteorite

41:56.560 --> 42:02.000
had landed from another solar system in the somewhere in the ocean on Earth. And that was

42:02.000 --> 42:06.320
obtained. And I love Avi. I'm, you know, like you, you know, kind of helping him out on his

42:06.320 --> 42:13.840
Project LAO. So we're both, you know, kind of Avi maximalists to use mixed metaphors. But Avi,

42:14.400 --> 42:18.800
you know, claims this is there, and it's based on trajectory data, highly controversial people,

42:18.800 --> 42:24.640
you know, can't reproduce it. But at any rate, if true, highlights the fact that materials,

42:24.640 --> 42:29.600
such as this meteorite, I've given you several of these, and you tried to snort one once.

42:29.600 --> 42:35.200
Anyway, these are meteorites. They come from Argentina. They're delivered by gravity and the

42:35.200 --> 42:43.280
U.S. Postal Service. They're hard iron, silicon, and cobalt. They're highly magnetic. And they came,

42:43.280 --> 42:46.960
and they smashed into Earth. Now, there are meteorites that I will never give to you,

42:46.960 --> 42:51.280
because they cost as much as my first, you know, two cars put together. I have,

42:51.280 --> 42:56.800
and it came from the planet Mars. So I have a chunk of Mars in my, in my lab. And that

42:56.800 --> 43:02.880
chunk of Mars was proven by gas chromatography and other tools to originate from Mars. Okay.

43:02.880 --> 43:07.440
Now, how did it get here? Same way. Blasted off of Mars by a Martian meteorite,

43:07.440 --> 43:11.200
kicked around the solar system for a few million years, landed on Earth in Northwest Africa.

43:11.920 --> 43:18.320
Now, the same process happens in reverse. Life carrying molecules could be embedded on rocks,

43:18.320 --> 43:22.400
and, you know, a chunk of a whale gets kicked out into space, and then eventually lands on Mars,

43:22.400 --> 43:26.240
right? But we have no evidence of that. We have no evidence of that happening

43:26.240 --> 43:30.160
over billions of years. Now, this could, this could, this has been happening as long as life

43:30.160 --> 43:34.960
has been on Earth, which Lee and others tell me is four billion years. So you have four billion

43:34.960 --> 43:41.120
years of opportunity to have panspermic transfers of life that we know exist on Earth,

43:41.120 --> 43:44.800
going to other parts of our solar system. And there's zero evidence, not, you know,

43:44.800 --> 43:49.840
I'm not asking for terraformed, you know, plateaus on Venus, just saying there's no evidence. Now,

43:49.840 --> 43:55.760
absence of evidence isn't proof of absence, but shouldn't, at some point, people start to take

43:55.760 --> 44:03.360
the lack of, you know, any sort of data or what have you as troubling in a Bayesian sense, that

44:03.360 --> 44:09.520
you can't put a prior that is so certain, close to 100% Lee tells me, that he believes aliens are

44:09.520 --> 44:13.520
inevitable, and you sound like you believe it as well. So, I want to ask you, what level,

44:13.520 --> 44:17.840
what would it take you to believe that aliens don't exist? Alien life, forget about intelligent,

44:17.840 --> 44:22.640
just life. Anywhere in the universe? Anywhere else in the universe. What would, I mean, what would

44:22.640 --> 44:26.720
I have to ask? What piece of evidence would you have to have to know that's impossible,

44:26.720 --> 44:29.680
that, you know, it's impossible for life to be elsewhere than Earth?

44:30.960 --> 44:36.880
Impossible? Vanishingly, vanishingly small. In other words, the people that say it's guaranteed,

44:36.880 --> 44:43.120
like Avi and Lee, and maybe you, I don't know, say it's all but guaranteed, the Fermi, you know,

44:43.120 --> 44:49.280
kind of suggestion, it's all but guaranteed. So, what series of piece of evidence would decrease

44:49.280 --> 44:54.800
that to as close to zero as you could imagine? You can't rule it out, obviously. Oh, you're

44:54.800 --> 44:59.760
going to hate this answer. We would get to the next level in physics. We would find out that it

44:59.760 --> 45:04.880
does give us the ability to buzz the cosmos. We would send out an enormous number of probes,

45:05.840 --> 45:13.040
and we would change our, we would tutor our Bayesian prior by exploring all of the

45:13.840 --> 45:20.480
most Earth-like exoplanets we could find, which are now cheap to visit because of new discoveries

45:21.280 --> 45:25.920
that were not available to us when we were stuck with Einstein's effective theory,

45:25.920 --> 45:34.400
or quantum field theory. That is what it would take. Right now, I can't see almost anything.

45:34.400 --> 45:38.960
Really? I mean, I can't get you beyond sea, but I can get you to see, I can get you the speed of

45:38.960 --> 45:44.320
light, right? We can have a discussion about the simulation hypothesis and that we can have avatars

45:44.320 --> 45:49.040
cruising about the universe. We don't see any evidence of that either, in contrast to my guest,

45:49.040 --> 45:55.040
David Shalmer's claim. So, I mean, we could travel at the speed of light. Isn't that good enough?

45:57.920 --> 46:01.040
Do we really have to go beyond the speed of light before you believe that they don't exist?

46:02.000 --> 46:07.280
You know, Brent, I don't know how to think about this. There's a suite of problems that is different

46:07.280 --> 46:12.400
than any problem we've ever solved in science. One of them would be the beginning, how did life

46:12.400 --> 46:16.800
begin? That would be an example of the class of problems I want to talk about, or another one of

46:16.800 --> 46:25.600
these would be, how do you get consciousness to evolve from the material world? Another of these

46:25.680 --> 46:33.920
would be contact or the ability to prove where did the origin of the universe, what is the origin

46:33.920 --> 46:42.640
of the universe? What is behind the surface of last scattering? Why do men and women take so much

46:43.920 --> 46:48.560
such different times when going to the restroom? You know, there are various things.

46:49.840 --> 46:53.680
What? There's something man is not meant to know, literally. Exactly. That's what I was trying to say

46:53.680 --> 47:03.840
with the surface of last scattering. I believe that we haven't solved any of these problems ever.

47:05.280 --> 47:12.160
The hardest things that we know how to do, look, the hardest thing that I know is quantum field

47:12.160 --> 47:29.840
theory. Quantum field theory is unbelievably difficult to learn, and it has gotten harder

47:29.840 --> 47:37.600
and easier. Now, I have the entire standard model in stylized form that animates.

47:37.680 --> 47:45.360
This is the classical input that when quantized gives us our understanding of the world, and it's

47:45.360 --> 47:52.960
incredibly simple. The idea that this fits on a mug, and you and I can go line by line symbol

47:52.960 --> 48:02.560
by symbol and say what everything is. Grand drinkification. We have only solved problems

48:02.560 --> 48:06.800
in the shallow end of science. We have never solved a problem outside of the shallow end of

48:06.800 --> 48:15.440
science. When people start to talk about free will, I just think, wow, you've gone from wearing floaties

48:15.440 --> 48:23.360
in the shallow end with your parents holding you up to wanting to surf shark infested waters

48:25.360 --> 48:31.840
off the coast of Portugal with monster waves and sharp rocks. Who knows what? It's a totally

48:31.840 --> 48:40.000
different level of science to figure out life's origin or consciousness or the beginning of the

48:40.000 --> 48:46.960
universe. We haven't gotten to any of these yet. I think what we're very good at is we're very good

48:46.960 --> 48:56.960
at extremely hard, simple problems. We're all interested in these questions, but my interest

48:56.960 --> 49:03.680
isn't in the recreational version of these. I know that if you and I did nothing else other than

49:03.680 --> 49:10.400
talk about free will for a year, we would get nowhere. The conversation would be recreation.

49:14.240 --> 49:18.000
I think we could have many different possible conversations. None of them will get anywhere.

49:18.640 --> 49:24.240
So I'm always curious as to why people say, I believe in free will. I don't. Okay, so you're

49:24.240 --> 49:31.280
going to do that thing. We need to do things that might work. And the things that might work have to

49:31.280 --> 49:39.200
do with like my friend Rima Khan is about to have her SETI meeting in San Francisco. We can listen

49:39.200 --> 49:43.920
for things. We can try to work on the laws of physics. I cannot believe we are still focused on

49:43.920 --> 49:50.080
rockets, but very rich people seem to like rockets. If they have any idea of the danger we're in here

49:50.080 --> 49:57.520
on earth, I think it's a completely bizarre feature of wealth and brilliance that brilliant,

49:57.520 --> 50:06.720
smart people choose rockets. Don't know why. We've got to do something. And we've never solved any

50:06.720 --> 50:12.320
of these problems. And I don't think we're going to get to these problems by pretending. I mean,

50:12.320 --> 50:18.640
I always want when somebody talks to me about what life will be like to bring up cephalopods.

50:19.600 --> 50:24.320
But I look at a cuttlefish, and I look at how intelligent a cuttlefish is, maybe not as smart

50:24.320 --> 50:32.240
as an octopus. But a cuttlefish is such an alien creature. It's so far away from us on the phylogenetic

50:32.240 --> 50:38.640
tree that it proves that you can't really easily anticipate what smart looks like.

50:41.040 --> 50:45.440
And it's probably the reason that the heptapods were used in that movie. What is it? Arrival?

50:46.160 --> 50:55.120
Yeah. And I think that the next physical theory is going to blow our minds. I think we've sat so

50:55.120 --> 51:01.280
long pretending to have our minds blown by entanglement and Schrodinger's cat and the fact

51:01.280 --> 51:13.840
that you get thinner and heavier in relativity theory, whatever, terrible paradox. That's not

51:13.840 --> 51:21.280
really the mind blowing stuff. What's about to come, I think, is going to rewrite our knowledge

51:21.280 --> 51:29.760
of ourselves just the way DNA did. So pitch me, I'm Elon. I can take $44 billion and put it

51:29.760 --> 51:40.240
towards Twitter. I can scrap it or even make it $43 billion. What do you tell him? What should he do?

51:40.240 --> 51:45.040
What would you do? He knows. I mean, what would I do? I mean, he's a physics major. He was a UPenn.

51:45.680 --> 51:50.800
I mean, more than physics major, he's evidenced, I think, continuing interest in physics.

51:51.680 --> 51:59.680
But he has hijacked the conversation of getting off the planet, which should be a conversation

51:59.680 --> 52:05.680
about many, many, many, many, many, many different experiments rather than the moon and Mars.

52:06.000 --> 52:11.920
And getting off with physics to being a conversation about rockets. So anytime you talk about diversifying

52:11.920 --> 52:19.520
existential risk to humans, someone will now say, oh, don't worry, bro, Elon's going to get us to Mars

52:20.080 --> 52:27.120
with those awesome, awesome rockets. It's like, I don't understand this. So I can't pitch Elon.

52:27.120 --> 52:32.560
So would you go, I mean, but again, to push back with respect, as you know, I always do. And I

52:33.280 --> 52:40.080
cheerfully recognize that I may have a huge blind spots myself. But it seems to me as if you're

52:40.080 --> 52:46.320
going back to 1491 and you're telling, you know, Queen Ismerella or whoever. Don't fund this guy,

52:46.320 --> 52:53.760
Chris. Chris C. Don't. He's just, wait, wait, wait. That doesn't make sense. We should do rockets.

52:54.400 --> 53:00.000
Okay. We shouldn't obsess about rockets. Right. Not rockets only in the portfolio. But again,

53:00.080 --> 53:03.200
let me just finish my torture analogy because it took me like a half an hour to make it up in

53:03.200 --> 53:08.320
the shower this morning. But, you know, you're telling her, we should really fund this guy,

53:08.320 --> 53:14.000
you know, Yitzhak Newton, or, you know, get these laws that will actually take us to the moon.

53:14.000 --> 53:19.760
You know, let's just skip ahead boats, forget about these barks and, and, and boats. Let's

53:19.760 --> 53:25.280
galleons. Let's skip ahead. I don't know that that would actually get us where we want to go.

53:25.280 --> 53:32.160
Right. Because you're saying, you know, this, your priors are going to be informed by the either,

53:32.160 --> 53:36.480
and a no-go theorem that says we can't go beyond Einstein. In which case, what would you say,

53:36.480 --> 53:42.960
there are no aliens? If we couldn't go beyond Einstein, yeah, we're trapped in the world.

53:42.960 --> 53:48.800
There's no, so like, this is another problem, which is, is that Einstein hijacked the conversation

53:48.800 --> 53:54.240
so that now every time we talk, it's like, no, dude, we have time dilation, we have worm holes.

53:54.320 --> 54:03.040
It's like, we have alcubierre drives. Blinding them. Oh, no, I thought you were making a crypto

54:03.040 --> 54:08.240
enthusiast with laser eyes. That's right. Einstein with laser eyes. I told you. Okay.

54:10.080 --> 54:11.840
Don't you? Okay. So,

54:15.360 --> 54:19.840
I don't think Elon shouldn't do rockets. I think rockets is a profitable business. And I think

54:19.920 --> 54:25.280
getting people excited about the future has to do with going back to the last moment when we actually,

54:25.280 --> 54:30.480
as a country, you know, we didn't want to say, let's develop ICBMs that are really efficient in

54:31.440 --> 54:35.760
hitting Beijing and Moscow. We said, we choose to go to the moon.

54:38.320 --> 54:47.520
And, okay. So, you know, true enough. So go to the moon. But stop with the terraforming in Mars,

54:48.480 --> 54:57.200
the light of human civilization. I just, you have to actually want to save us from ourselves right

54:57.200 --> 55:03.920
now and talk about it in order to realize how completely crazy Elon has made everyone who

55:03.920 --> 55:11.840
listens to him. Because at the moment, if you had Einstein and you had Elon, people would be gravitating

55:11.840 --> 55:21.920
to Elon. He's charismatic. He's nailed in a world which is not comfortable with masculine traits.

55:22.480 --> 55:29.920
He's highly chaotic. He's very entertaining. And people have this idea like, yo, dude,

55:29.920 --> 55:33.760
he's the richest man in the world, bro. And that's the currency of our time.

55:34.480 --> 55:39.840
So my feeling about this is everyone, Elon reaches with the story of terraforming Mars

55:39.840 --> 55:48.640
with rockets and all this kind of stuff, thinks that's the plan. And I just think it's completely

55:48.640 --> 55:57.120
crazy to get everything right and then go rockets terraforming Mars right at the end and just like,

55:57.840 --> 56:04.160
dude, I just read this entire, you know, war and peace length novel and then in the last page, you

56:04.160 --> 56:10.880
just do something completely bizarre. I just don't get it. Maybe I'm dumb. Maybe I don't,

56:10.880 --> 56:15.200
I don't understand. I don't think it's Ferdinand and Isabella. I think that they, you know, we needed

56:15.200 --> 56:22.160
to fund universities that studied natural philosophy and mathematics and physics. And we needed to

56:22.160 --> 56:27.040
explore the world because we didn't know what was here. And we should go to Mars and we should go to

56:27.040 --> 56:32.160
the moon. And we should have, if somebody said that our rocket allocation is stupid, we should

56:32.160 --> 56:37.520
take it to zero, I would be fighting tooth and nail to make sure that rockets are budgeted.

56:39.200 --> 56:43.280
Okay. The emphasis on rockets is psychotic.

56:45.920 --> 56:51.760
It's like you're looking at a portfolio of a very, very rich person that's only in one municipal

56:51.760 --> 56:56.880
bond or something. And you're like, make this make sense.

56:57.200 --> 57:04.480
Yeah, he is. But then, of course, he is, you know, more diversified neurologically than almost

57:04.480 --> 57:09.920
anybody. I'm just saying that he doesn't have the right to hijack the rock that the

57:11.280 --> 57:15.840
we need to spread out and diversify because we're going to get ourselves killed on one planet with

57:15.840 --> 57:23.680
a shared atmosphere. It's completely unreasonable for him. It's wonderful. I mean, I just, I have a

57:23.680 --> 57:28.320
very clear idea that he's one of the smartest, most forward thinking people, and he's got a

57:28.320 --> 57:35.280
rocket company and he's talking in some sense his book. Right. And he knows, look, I don't know him,

57:36.000 --> 57:40.640
but I almost, I almost feel like I can guarantee you he knows better.

57:43.120 --> 57:48.640
And so, you know, I don't want to speculate on what his strategy is, but he knows better than to

57:48.720 --> 57:53.200
bet everything on Mars terraforming and the moon with rockets. Right.

57:54.080 --> 58:03.840
Now, pivoting maybe slightly away, we look at, you know, what what we could do, you pointed to one

58:03.840 --> 58:09.680
thing in there, you mentioned universities and how important they were. Now in 1492, the university

58:09.680 --> 58:16.560
system was only about 400 years old at that point. And and it's it's aged since then and starting in

58:16.560 --> 58:24.080
1080 or so in Bologna. And very little has changed. And I wonder, you know, the best and the brightest,

58:24.080 --> 58:29.840
so to speak, what they might be getting sucked up into this orbit of Elon, no pun intended,

58:29.840 --> 58:34.560
or this this kind of thinking or many other things crypto. But at least people like Michael

58:34.560 --> 58:40.720
Saylor, who I had on the show last year, is very gracious and forward thinking as well.

58:42.080 --> 58:46.400
You know, he started Saylor Academy. And that's sort of a university that only is going to produce

58:46.400 --> 58:52.080
STEM majors, not going to produce, you know, gender studies majors, and it's not going to produce

58:52.080 --> 58:56.640
things that are not related to pure science, technology, engineering and math, because he

58:56.640 --> 59:01.680
believes that we need, you know, a million PhDs in these fields in order for us to progress. And

59:01.680 --> 59:07.120
actually, I think the limiting factor for Elon is going to be humans. It's not going to be robots.

59:07.120 --> 59:12.320
It's not going to be capital. It's going to be having enough people. And so the fault that I have

59:12.320 --> 59:17.440
for him is that I don't see any and I'm not saying, Oh, give, you know, yesterday, a billion,

59:17.440 --> 59:22.160
$100 million was given to Stanford University for sustainability. I'm not even saying Elon,

59:22.160 --> 59:26.800
you know, hook, you see up Steve up with with the Musk Institute will churn out your P it because

59:26.800 --> 59:31.280
I don't think I can do it either. Is that is there fundamental limitation for us getting off the

59:31.280 --> 59:36.240
planet in your language, or becoming interplanetary in his language or transcending the laws of physics

59:36.240 --> 59:40.640
in your language getting off the planetary species and his life? Is it humans? And is it

59:40.640 --> 59:45.680
solvable? Because I can't just nuclear it as good as I am. I can't just nuclear it out of the vacuum

59:45.680 --> 59:53.680
kids. Well, but okay, so let's look at the very weird question of anybody with a halfway interesting

59:54.880 --> 59:59.520
version of a theory beyond the standard model. And I don't mean

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:07.600
sorry, I'm going to be very careful about the phrase. We have large programs,

01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:13.280
grand unification, supersymmetry, technicolor, super strings, etc.

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:22.560
These are the big programs. More or less, if you're not on a big program, I know of almost no one

01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:33.040
inside the university system, who's got a truly interesting audacious idea for what to do next.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:41.440
I could tell you that, you know, Peter Wojt, for example, has moved from being a curmudgeon

01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:47.520
to actually saying this I believe, which is fascinating. I mean, imagine if Sabina Hossenfelder,

01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:54.240
instead of complaining about the gobbledygook or the fact that people are actually, you know,

01:00:54.240 --> 01:01:01.040
and she's quite accurate, I think, about this overselling things that don't work. But I really

01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:07.760
love that Peter moved towards saying this is what I think may be generating all of this.

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:14.800
He's there in a nontraditional role inside of the math department of Columbia University. He's

01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:22.080
writing books, he's writing papers, he's giving talks, but he's not a professor. Same thing with,

01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:27.680
you know, David Deutch has a really weird situation at Oxford. Garrett Lisey has a very

01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:33.440
weird situation wherever he is. Julian Barbour has a weird situation. Stephen Wolfram.

01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:42.960
Inside the universities, we've turned it into the Hunger Games academically, and so everyone

01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:46.960
is worried about survival and nobody's actually worried about physics because they're worried

01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:52.480
about personal survival, they're not worried about general survival. I think what you have to look at

01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:57.440
is that there is a reluctance. I mean, one of the things I say that doesn't win me a ton of

01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:06.080
friends is that it appears that nobody actually has any money. And the reason that I say that is

01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:15.200
that all sorts of, it feels to me like nobody, we have, there were Rockefellers. They built

01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:21.040
Rockefeller University and the University of Chicago, one of our absolute jewels. You know,

01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:25.680
Vanderbilt, there's a Vanderbilt University, Carnegie had money, there's a Carnegie,

01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:34.800
Leyland Stanford, we don't want to invest anymore in this stuff. There's a general anti-science

01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:40.240
thing partially, I think, fueled by the fact that when Anthony Fauci says, I am the science, trust

01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:52.480
the science, we are revulsed, we recoil in war, maybe I should say it that way. And I think people

01:02:52.480 --> 01:03:01.600
who have money are turning away from universities because those containers are seemingly very

01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:10.640
susceptible to revolutionary nonsense. And so why would you build a container and then put great

01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:18.000
stuff in it only to have it instantly corrupted by the associate dean of niceness goodness and

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:26.800
fluffy puppy dogs for pediatric oncology patients? You know, it's like, okay, we need to help kids

01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:34.000
who are facing cancer, we need, I have a dog, I like good things, ice cream, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:41.280
But the university is attesting to their own fundamental goodness at every turn and denouncing

01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:49.760
everyone who disagrees with them as Genghis Khan Hitler or Lizzie Borden or whatever. It's not a

01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:59.200
very appealing pitch to people with resources. So what I'm seeing is that more or less people

01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:06.720
with incredible resources don't want to spend on things that are important. They've been tinged

01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:26.080
with this kind of failure and greediness. And I think one of the things we need to do is if the

01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:32.480
government is just going to renege on the endless frontier compact between the universities and

01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:38.960
the federal government, I don't want to be in a intellectual property category where we can't

01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:45.200
monetize what we discover. I just want to take you by your ankles and say, God damn it, you fooled us,

01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:49.680
give us all our money back that we generated for you. We built the entire economy and you treat us

01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:56.800
like we're your servants, you're making me sick to my stomach. For God's sakes, grow a pair and

01:04:56.800 --> 01:05:01.520
recognize you've got the world's greatest deal and that these people basically have integrity and

01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:06.960
you're turning their lives upside down into a horror where people don't want to go into their

01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:13.760
offices and universities. When I was just touring universities on the East Coast, professors would

01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:18.240
close their doors and in hushed tones, they would say, I can't really say this outside, but things

01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:22.960
have gotten really crazy here. And I'm thinking, you're the owners of the university. No matter

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:28.080
what anyone tells you, you don't want to send your kid to a university that isn't run effectively by

01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:33.600
its professors. Universities are not primarily about teaching. You should go to a college if

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:38.960
you're focused on teaching. Universities are about research. The research is done by professors

01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:46.560
and by far the most important research is done in STEM. I mean, I think there's very important

01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:51.360
research that's been done in folklore, ethnomusicology was something I considered going into.

01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:58.640
There's plenty of things that can be researched that aren't STEM. But the most important things we

01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:05.280
do is to better understand the world in which we live, gain power and wisdom to control it.

01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:11.840
And if the humanities aren't going to be giving us wisdom, but are going to be giving us negative

01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:18.240
wisdom, it's very important that anybody with hate in their heart who talks about anti-racism all

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:23.920
day long, which is just another name for racism, should not be informing people who might have to

01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:31.280
make nuclear weapons or fuel air explosives or any one of the horrible things that we may need to

01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:38.800
keep ourselves safe. It's very important to keep lunatics away from the stuff that actually works.

01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:50.160
And I mean, I've always agreed with you in general terms, but I do feel like we have kind of an

01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:58.480
opportunity that is only kind of full of latency when it's thought prospectively in the future.

01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:06.160
In other words, the inventor of the laser, Charlie Towns or the inventor of GPS and

01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:12.720
things like that or Einstein, these people died, you know, not wealthy people. And yet,

01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:19.120
if they had attempted, and yet the creator of Ethernet, you know, the three-com, you know,

01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:20.160
is currently a triple-

01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:21.680
What terms, Brian?

01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:25.760
Wealthy financially. So we can define wealth other ways, obviously.

01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:31.280
But let's pause that just for one second. I'm going to disagree in very strong terms.

01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:37.280
I went into academics in large measure for freedom.

01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:42.960
And that's why people go into business for freedom.

01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:49.280
I think that if you priced the freedom that somebody like Noam Chomsky enjoyed,

01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:55.680
you know, probably had his pension taken care of, probably was made an institute professor at MIT,

01:07:55.680 --> 01:08:02.400
could draw off on any topic. He had this giant army behind him that would stand up for his freedom

01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:10.480
of expression and freedom of inquiry. The functional equivalent of Noam Chomsky's wealth was absolutely

01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:11.520
enormous.

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:16.320
Oh, sure. I'm not debating that. And you can have, by the way, you can have both. Elon, you know,

01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:20.480
dictates you can have both. You can have intellectual capital as well. But I'm thinking purely

01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:26.720
for the translation ability of wealth to then be used to research purposes. So you made the argument

01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:31.680
that we should have taxed, you know, semiconductor instructions or emails, all of which are invented

01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:32.880
by physicists or appliances.

01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:36.800
No, we shouldn't have done that. We should have kept our agreements. But if you're going to be a

01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:43.120
prick about it, by all means, you're basically taking everything that was developed by people

01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:50.160
that you've now treated as your servants, who you've actually legally hobbled. And my feeling

01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:54.080
about this is that's completely unethical.

01:08:54.080 --> 01:09:00.240
100%. All I'm saying is that the biggest lie in finance is that past performance isn't indicative

01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:06.480
of future, you know, returns. I mean, look at, look at whatever, pick whatever pre.com company

01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:11.680
you like. So all I'm saying is that given that academia and academicians like the ones that

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:15.440
you mentioned have been treated like garbage and that physicists have not been able to not

01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:20.080
monetize for our selfish own internal purposes, which I believe we deserve. But I'm not going

01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:26.000
to talk about that for the purpose of physics for the greater glory of physics. I claim we need

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:31.200
to start with an educational campaign now. In other words, we say the next project that's going

01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:36.400
to be developed with quantum computing or before it's monetized, and we lose the rights to say,

01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:41.600
hold on, I didn't sign off on this IP, we need to be smart. And I don't think there's any training

01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:44.960
you know, certainly I'm guilty. I don't train my graduates since I'm blessed to have so many

01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:48.800
brilliant kids. I never sit down. So if you ever get into a situation, I have two patents, by the

01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:52.480
way. I never sit down and say like, if I'm ever in the situation where this thing could make,

01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:57.280
you know, millions of like, here's what I should do in order to benefit. But I think we need something.

01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:01.520
It's it should be in some way incorporated into our education. And I think the best way to do that

01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:07.200
ironically is through the humanities show through history of physics as you know better than anybody.

01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:10.880
Although I always say it's if you want to if you want to damn somebody with fake praise and as a

01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:16.080
scientist, he's really knowledgeable about the history of physics, you know, it's like, it's

01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:20.720
such a backhanded compliment. But you do in all honesty, and all seriousness, you do understand

01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:26.560
it. Let me get back on that because that's kind of a dig. My feeling about this is you don't need

01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:33.040
to know the history of physics if you want to do relatively workman like scientific research.

01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:38.240
The only people who really need to understand the history of physics aren't most physicists. It's

01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:43.920
the tiny number of people who are going to do things like break new ground. So it's really

01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:48.880
important not to sell the history of physics to everybody, you can become a calculation monkey

01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:55.520
and go to any calculation monkey school and do calculation monkey equations. That's fine.

01:10:56.160 --> 01:11:02.080
The really hard thing is to try to figure out how did people break out of cognitive prisons?

01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:08.640
And so, you know, some of the funniest things is when people have these insults,

01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:14.400
like the one you just said, it's like, well, yeah, because you didn't understand what it was

01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:21.120
about to begin with. Yeah, I agree. I guess all I'm saying is wouldn't it be great to have education

01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:28.000
so that the next time we invent the internet, you know, hypertext protocols, that we can think

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:32.400
for a second now, how do we do this? How do we renegotiate the contract? That's what I want to

01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:37.760
say. You're a very astute, you've picked up on the problem, but we can't go back and rectify the

01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:42.400
past performance, but we can say, given the way that the history of the field is gone, you want to

01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:49.760
invent the quantum, you know, Bose-Einstein condensate laser that will be used for God knows what,

01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:55.760
before you do that, we should have an honest conversation about our crisper or whatever.

01:11:55.760 --> 01:12:04.080
Well, where are the mega fortunes that are interested in this stuff? And my claim is,

01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:10.800
you know, we both talked to Jim Simons. Jim knows how important this stuff is, and he's put a fair

01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:17.920
amount of capital behind this. In my, you know, at some point, I had a conversation with him

01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:23.920
about fixing education. And he said, I spent a fair amount of time on it. And the only thing

01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:27.760
that actually seemed to make sense is to take terrible teachers and make them slightly less

01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:34.720
terrible. And it was just, it was a heartbreaking thing. So I've seen people plow money into some

01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:44.160
of these things and get very little back. The things that work can't be said very easily right

01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:50.400
now because they're out of keeping with the ethos of our time. You meet people, how do you know

01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:59.120
who's good? Because you talk to them. You find out whether they have 12 ideas before

01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:06.000
they have a cup of coffee and three of them are good, you know, three good ideas. That's

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:16.000
astounding. It's hard to have good ideas. We basically know who's good. And we don't get to

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:23.040
dial their facial characteristics or look at their chromosomes or whatever. You know, good is good.

01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:33.200
Famously, Ramanujan was, you know, sent a letter to Hardy and Hardy and Little would read it in

01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:40.400
Cambridge and they said, well, either he's a humbug or a genius. And we guessed genius because

01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:48.640
humbugs are relatively rare. Beautiful one. We know who's good. We know who to fund and we

01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:53.360
know how to leave people alone and nobody wants to do it. Everybody wants to say, oh, it's all in

01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:59.760
the ethos and the myth of the lone individual and, you know, this is so elitist, all this kind of

01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:05.280
nonsense. Okay, well, I don't know how to tell you this, but you're just, you're wrong 12,000 ways

01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:11.440
from Sunday. And you're going to destroy everything that we know how to do. Many of the people who

01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:18.400
make real breakthroughs are very difficult to deal with. And if you don't want to deal with people

01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:24.320
who are difficult to deal with, you can just sort of write off most progress. Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't

01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:32.320
leave Feynman alone with my daughter or your daughter. But but he sure knew his way. That's

01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:36.960
true because we don't want Feynman maced or kicked in the groin because he's a valuable human.

01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:42.960
And our kids are skilled in the deadly arts of the groin attack from Krav Maga training that we

01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:49.440
give them. And that is a mitzvah for all of you. Yes, exactly. So we're talking with Eric Weinstein,

01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:55.520
proprietor of the portal podcast, among the other things. You can find Eric at Eric R Weinstein

01:14:55.520 --> 01:15:02.240
at both Twitter and on Instagram. He has a website. It was about a year ago, we had a conversation

01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:08.640
about geometric unity. And I want to talk about that. Because it's still it's still it haunts

01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:15.040
my dreams. It's still something that's very delightful. And and it represents a sort of a

01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:21.120
sort of, you know, candle in the darkness, a sort of hope, a scream in the void, thinking big things.

01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:26.640
Obviously, it's not, you know, there are people that have, as you mentioned, Peter Boyd, Garrett

01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:33.680
Leasy, there, there are a surf fight of other contender theories that have their own lacunae.

01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:38.800
But where, where, where are you now with with geometric unity? Where is the project at this

01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:45.520
point? Well, I'm talking to a lot more different physicists. And who have you met with most recently

01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:50.160
that's most exciting for you, besides present company, obviously. Well, I mean, I don't want to

01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:55.200
get into details, but I think probably one of the best conversations I had recently might have been

01:15:55.200 --> 01:16:04.800
with Nima, Arkani Hamed. There's a local graduate student, I'm going to mention his name, because

01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:12.960
he deserves it. And what is the name to watch Trevor Schopener at UCLA is an unbelievable

01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:21.120
up and coming guy in things V burns group. But I've been, you know, talking with Avi about

01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:27.840
astrophysics, discussed with Alan Gooth recently, some aspects of

01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:38.560
how multiple generations are generated. Just a fairly colleagues in France.

01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:47.120
I've been, I've been very lucky to have access to great people. And I think that one of the things

01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:57.520
that's happened is that with supersymmetry, and with string theory, not being able to

01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:04.480
find something that really shows us that they're on the right track.

01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:16.320
People are slowly open to the idea of either shutting high energy, fundamental physics down,

01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:22.480
and it's going to be up in arms about that. There's like a huge move to move towards

01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:28.160
quantum computation. You say, why is that? It's like, oh, well, because computers have

01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:33.360
been really important. And so the metaphor of the universe as a computer is really important.

01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:42.240
Information, maybe we can rebase everything around information. It's something you can do, you can try.

01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:48.160
But I think right at the moment, where we are is that

01:17:53.680 --> 01:18:02.480
we realize that the Baby Boomer program has run its course. The Baby Boomer program was strings.

01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:12.720
Almost all of the people in string theory came up. They viewed the world a particular way. They

01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:20.640
changed the problems that we thought of as fundamental. Quantizing gravity became the

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:30.480
problem to work on, which I think was absolutely wrong. And what we find ourselves in is a world in

01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:36.640
which the old thing that was crowding out everything else is in the process of dying,

01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:41.200
and that is string fundamentalism. And one of the great things about talking to Nima

01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:50.960
was, for me, that Nima is not captured by strings, but he's animated by strings,

01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:57.120
which is exactly the right position to be in, which is that you're not 100% sure that strings

01:18:57.360 --> 01:19:01.280
are the right direction to go. But you can say, look at all of the things that string theory

01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:10.480
accomplishes inside of quantum field theory. It gives us paradigmatic ways in which we can elude

01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:16.880
certain seemingly no-go theorems and the like, or it's taught us a lot. And I think that the toy

01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:22.800
theories that really came along with the string guys, because the string guys are mostly guys,

01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:34.400
not 100%, but too much, more or less used a lot of toy quantum field theories to explore some of

01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:40.640
these ideas. That was a second program. That was very good, by the way, on their part for developing

01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:45.360
quantum field theory as a discipline, but it's been a disaster for uncovering new physical

01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:52.160
law and new physical explanations. So I do think that right at the moment, people would be open,

01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:57.680
but there's no, we should be building accelerators. We should be getting people,

01:19:57.680 --> 01:20:02.880
here's the crazy thing, Brian. I'm dancing around it and trying not to say it, but maybe I'll just

01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:10.560
say it. We just had this W mass announcement. The W particle appears to be much heavier,

01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:17.360
and by much, I don't mean like three times as heavy, but I mean by an appreciable amount,

01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:23.680
heavier than we thought. And I watch everyone's explanations of this to the public,

01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:29.120
and I haven't seen one that really sounds to me like what this thing actually is.

01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:36.640
We settle on these, here's how we talk to the public about the W message. Well, what is the

01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:44.560
W particle? It's more or less a part of a derivative from calculus. And what does a derivative want

01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:50.480
to do? It wants to differentiate functions. Well, what functions does it have? Well, it can

01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:57.200
differentiate something called a Higgs field. Now, if you look at this mug, for example, and I'm not

01:20:57.200 --> 01:21:04.320
good at going around. Drinking and deriving. Drinking and deriving. That term right there,

01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:16.480
which probably looks like d sub mu of phi norm squared. That term is where the W particle interacts

01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:21.520
with the Higgs particle. So you're effectively using the W particle to differentiate a Higgs

01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:29.360
particle just the way you use the photon to differentiate an electron. That process by which

01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:38.320
the Higgs particle gives mass to a small number of pieces of a derivative, the W and Z particles.

01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:46.480
It gives mass in some sense to itself. You've got this potential term here. You've got Yukawa terms

01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:55.280
here where it's giving mass the same phi is occurring here. All of, sorry, not hold that up. So this

01:21:55.360 --> 01:22:00.960
is where the W particle is getting mass. This is where the Higgs is getting mass from itself

01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:10.240
through its interaction with the Mexican hat potential, the sombrero. The Yukawa term where the

01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:16.640
fermions, the electrons and protons get mass. That whole system isn't explained to anybody in the

01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:23.920
public, which is criminal. And then I've sort of been in this kind of self-examination phase,

01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:28.880
which is, oh, Eric, you use so many big words. Why can't we understand you? I was like, well,

01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:33.200
one thing is almost nobody's actually trying to tell you what's really going on.

01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:38.640
And when I sit there and I say, okay, the W particle is part of a derivative,

01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:45.200
all my colleagues know what I'm saying. But they're not venturing out there to say

01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:50.080
something so simple. And I don't know why they're not doing it. So the public isn't animated.

01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:58.160
Like, the fact is, this mug, if you had this mug in your house and you said,

01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:01.840
more or less, everything other than gravity is on that mug,

01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:09.040
somebody would want to know, one person in your family, like, well, how do I read it?

01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:15.440
What does it mean? What are the different terms? Do they have names? Nobody is talking to the public

01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:23.360
about what it is that we do. And that's how I get into trouble. I say, hey, I have an

01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:28.560
explanation for why there are three generations of matter. I don't even know that's a problem.

01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:35.760
So if you think about the sort of things that GU is doing different than, let's say, Garrett or

01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:41.760
Peter White, one of the things I think that's exciting is that a good theory should probably

01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:48.000
tell the standard model and general relativity what it got wrong. And I don't think anybody

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:52.160
inside of the academic system wants to do that. They want to extend only.

01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:58.080
You know, and this is why, for example, everybody will add sterile neutrinos to the standard model,

01:23:58.080 --> 01:24:01.600
because it's like, it's the least offensive thing that won't screw anything up.

01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:08.640
So I've been thinking a lot about this, which is why do why do none of us talk to the public

01:24:08.720 --> 01:24:14.000
in real terms? Why do we allow Feynman's dumbest statements to characterize

01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:19.440
what seems to be the height of sophistication? If you can't explain it to your grandma, it means

01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:24.720
you don't understand it. If I can't create the word world myself, then I'm useless. It's like,

01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:31.040
okay, well, it's a lot of machismo, but it's not very smart. And in those

01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:38.400
opportunities, none of us are really filling it in. We're not talking about what the W particle is.

01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:41.920
We're not talking about why it's important. We're not talking about why this is so exciting.

01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:46.880
I can hardly sleep. I don't even know that it's real. Maybe it may be wrong.

01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:51.840
Well, we know things are real. We know calculus is real. And let's start with a,

01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:56.080
you know, when I learned calculus, I had a self teach it to myself, because I actually wasn't

01:24:56.080 --> 01:25:01.440
placed along a math track that would have taken me to take the APs. And I had to kind of self

01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:05.360
motivate. And that came because of the love of astronomy that I wanted to find out, well,

01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:09.680
how do we know these galaxies are moving away? How do we know Haley's comets orbit and all sorts

01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:14.320
of things that were going on at the time when I was a, you know, preteen? And so I had to teach

01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:19.680
it myself. But once I learned it, I kind of felt like I had, you know, gotten the cheat code, you

01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:24.320
know, just I started to see things in a different way. And I went through the portal. And at that

01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:30.000
moment, I felt a great gift had been given to me. And it was given by myself. But in the sense that

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:34.480
I was given these gifts from the great people that came before me, including my hero, Gale,

01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:39.840
Gale, who I want to talk about, because I have exciting news about a wonderful project that

01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:45.760
I've been blessed to work on the last couple of years now, and it's come to fruition. But I feel

01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:49.840
like we're doing a disservice. That's why I say, I kind of joke in the past, but I'm getting more

01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:54.880
and more serious. I feel the scientists like me, especially like me, who get paid by the public,

01:25:55.680 --> 01:26:03.040
have a moral obligation to teach the most exciting and most delightful, delicious developments

01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:08.160
to the public for free. And they should do that as part of their as part of their job, quote,

01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:12.800
and they'll say, I'm not good at it. And to which I'll say, oh, yeah, I forgot, when you were born,

01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:15.840
you knew quantum field theory. Oh, no, no, I had to learn that it was very hard. And it's very

01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:20.480
sophisticated. Okay, so you spend time on things you think are valuable, right, my fellow professors.

01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:25.280
And it doesn't make me popular around the faculty club. But I do believe that, you know, especially,

01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:30.240
but in every professor, every scientist is supported by the public at some level or another.

01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:34.400
So, you know, we have a we have a huge we have a branding problem, we talked about the marketing

01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:42.320
problem. But we also have kind of a an education and a self obligation that scientists don't feel,

01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:46.080
we feel like we can sit around be the be the equation monkeys that you were talking about

01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:52.320
before. It's not true, Brian. I just, I mean, disagree with this. Here's the basic problem,

01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:56.240
because I've gone through this now. Let's imagine you want to understand what the W

01:26:56.240 --> 01:27:01.520
particle is in the Higgs particle and why this matters, right? So there's some safe thing that

01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:08.000
everyone can say, and then you can try to actually be real, and then get attacked. So I don't like

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:14.080
being attacked. It's, I've got idiots who follow me around who call up my colleagues and try to

01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:21.680
alienate everyone for me. And my feeling about these people is, once you understand what the

01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:29.120
cost is, you understand why nobody does it. But here's a cord, okay? This cord represents a function.

01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:37.440
The height of the cord is a function. And the W particle is in part a level.

01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:46.720
And that level could be horizontal. Or we could use the level to define what is horizontal.

01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:53.360
Right? And so if I pick this, we all know that the derivative is the rise over run above that level.

01:27:54.560 --> 01:28:00.640
But if I say, you know what, I have fiat power, and I'm going to decide that not this, but this

01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:06.080
is level, then the cord that is tangent at that point is actually constant, even though it appears

01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:14.880
to be rising. Okay? Now, I didn't use any big words. You're watching the con Eric showing off

01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:19.440
Eric is doing this. In the comments, people are saying, Eric, please read a book about this.

01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:26.480
Well, some, most of them, but my point is a tiny number of people who are terrible and who just

01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:32.640
don't want good things to happen, don't want us to try and fumble in front of the public.

01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:39.360
And they don't want us to succeed because then we get large follower counts. And it's like, well,

01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:44.960
why is that guy the most, you know, followed mathematician on Twitter? It's like, that should

01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:50.320
be me. Okay, maybe it should be you. I'll tell you the one thing, if you really have enemies,

01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:57.440
wish them fame, I promise you, they want it. You don't want it. It's a great deal.

01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:06.320
What we need to do is to be more courageous about saying, look, you're not going to understand

01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:10.240
quantum field theory, but here's some things you can break out. If you can keep up with the

01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:15.920
Kardashian, you can, you can keep up with quarks, you can keep up with hadrons and leptons. There

01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:21.440
aren't so many, there aren't so many hadrons and leptons that you can't learn them all in an afternoon.

01:29:22.720 --> 01:29:26.560
Right? They're probably about as many fundamental particles as there are Kardashians.

01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:33.680
And the idea that we don't talk about this, we don't traffic in it, we're not excited about this.

01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:41.920
Think about 90 years ago, this is the 90th year anniversary of the neutron. We didn't

01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:48.000
know that there were neutrons. So my aunt, who is in her late 90s, grew up before there were

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:52.480
neutrons. So when she was a very little girl, nobody knew what a neutron was. Almost immediately

01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:57.600
after the discovery of neutrons, we get chain reactions. We get atomic weapons and atomic power.

01:29:57.600 --> 01:30:08.160
That discovery within living memory made the world a completely different place.

01:30:08.160 --> 01:30:14.720
And watch out for what comes next. As an adaptation of the old saying, you may not be

01:30:14.720 --> 01:30:23.120
interested in physics, but boy is physics going to be interested in it. And the idea that you're

01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:29.840
not part of the conversation, which is who are we, what is this place and can we go and look at

01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:39.840
the night sky and dream responsibly without wormholes and without sci-fi of visiting. If that

01:30:39.840 --> 01:30:45.680
doesn't animate you, I guarantee you, you probably can't find a Jimi Hendrix guitar solo that moves

01:30:45.680 --> 01:30:50.960
you either. And that brings up the other chords that you're capable of bringing out and show your

01:30:50.960 --> 01:30:55.680
guitar. We're going to get that at the very end. So people in the chat room are saying things that

01:30:55.680 --> 01:31:03.040
Kim Kardashian actually has a nice set of bosons. That's kind of cool to know. But Eric, if actually

01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:10.000
listeners and viewers, 800 people watching right now, if you'd like Eric to write a book about this,

01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:16.400
give a thumbs up to this video, and we'll see if we can create the groundswell necessary

01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:22.080
to do this labor of love, which is writing a book. And I've actually just produced my third

01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:28.720
book, and I can't believe it, three books in four years. This one I didn't write. So this one I had

01:31:28.720 --> 01:31:34.560
a ghost writer, literally, and the name of the ghost writer. Are we on the verge of a major

01:31:34.560 --> 01:31:40.240
announcement, which I don't even know? You don't know it. It is a major announcement, at least in

01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:45.520
my life. I've been putting it out on Twitter here and there. But now I want to come clean and really

01:31:45.520 --> 01:31:55.520
announce it for all time. And that is 390 years ago. So 300 years before the neutron. A man by

01:31:55.520 --> 01:32:01.680
the name of Galileo Galilei wrote a book that got him in a tiny bit of hot water. He was kind of the

01:32:01.680 --> 01:32:07.680
Weinstein of his day, not afraid to be provocative in some ways, take liberties and take a license.

01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:11.440
And he wrote a book called The Dialogue. And this book, it was in Italian, it was called The

01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:17.280
Dialogue. And it was in contradistinction to his first book called The Ciderius Nuncius. Ciderius

01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:23.120
Nuncius, as you all know, is Latin for starry messenger, and he was allowed to keep publishing

01:32:23.120 --> 01:32:27.360
in Latin because nobody spoke Latin. And so it wasn't a threat to the Catholic Church.

01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:32.640
But after he used the spyglass, as he called it, the perspective tube, the telescope,

01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:39.120
he found that he could not really get over the overwhelming evidence that was presented to him,

01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:43.520
and he wanted to share it for the world with the notion that the universe is not centered on the

01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:49.600
earth, it's centered on the sun. And so he was advancing Copernicus theory and other earlier

01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:53.760
theories as well. And he wrote this wonderful book. It's called The Dialogue. It's actually a

01:32:53.760 --> 01:33:00.160
trial log between three characters, one of whom is modeled after Galileo himself. And he gave

01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:06.560
this character the name Salviati, the salvation. And then the other one was modeled after the

01:33:06.560 --> 01:33:11.600
Pope, Pope Urban, and his arguments. And he put his arguments in the name of a character named

01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:18.720
Simplicio, the simpleton. I love this because it shows that even the most biggest geniuses in

01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:24.880
academia can have huge fatal flaws in their impolitic behavior. And then there's a third

01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:30.880
character who's an intelligent layperson. His name is Sagredo. So I got the most famous two Italians

01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:38.720
that I know, Carlo Revelli and Fabiola Gianatti, who you love for her use of comic sans. And so

01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:45.600
we at the Higgs-Boson announcement. So we should say that one of them is a famous theorist. It's

01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:56.880
attached to Luke quantum gravity. The other one is a big shot physicist with the CERN experiment.

01:33:56.880 --> 01:34:02.560
Yeah, the director of CERN, which is where the LHC is located and responsible for discovery of

01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:08.960
the Higgs-Boson. So we and along with Jim Gates, who's another friend of yours, a professor at

01:34:08.960 --> 01:34:13.360
the Ford Foundation, professor at Brown University, where I will be returning. And that's stay tuned

01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:19.520
for a top secret announcement at the end of this month. I have great respect for him and I've

01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:26.960
enjoyed meeting him, but we are not close. So the five or six of us put together a audio book,

01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:33.120
the first ever audio book by Galileo. So it exists and you can get it wherever books or audio

01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:39.040
bowl lies, including Amazon, Audible, Google Play, wherever you like. I'll put a link to it in the

01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:43.680
show notes below. And it was really a labor of love. It took us a year to record it, edit it,

01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:50.320
and our home studios are around the world in Italy. Carlo was in Italy and in Aix and Provence,

01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:53.680
or however you pronounce that. And then my friend Lucio Picharillo is the third character.

01:34:54.240 --> 01:35:00.080
We recorded it. And so much of what comes through in this wonderful book is just beyond

01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:05.280
my comprehension as a physicist. And actually, Frank Wilczek, I should say,

01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:12.080
narrated the Nobel Prize winner 2004 Nobel Prize winner for Asymptotic Freedom.

01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:18.720
He narrated the dedication by Albert Einstein, the forward to the book by Galileo, in which

01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:22.640
he calls this book by Galileo the most important book ever written.

01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:25.360
Einstein called Galileo's book.

01:35:25.360 --> 01:35:30.480
Yes, Einstein called the dialogue the most, not just science book, but really the most important

01:35:30.480 --> 01:35:36.080
book that had really ever been written, fiction, nonfiction, however you like to say it, including

01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:41.920
his own work. So it was incredibly gratifying to have these people come together and do it.

01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:46.480
And of course, this book is Italian, and it was written originally in Italian,

01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:53.280
and we had to have it translated. And so anyway, I started off doing it really kind of as a kind

01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:58.320
of a lark. But then I decided that there could be some spin off opportunities, not really just for

01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:03.520
me, but I think maybe for physics, and I want to get your impression on. So one thing about this

01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:08.560
book, they're extremely expensive to get your hands on a original copy of the dialogue, 390-year-old

01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:14.640
books are very rare, obviously. So I decided I have a collector friend who allowed me to scan

01:36:14.640 --> 01:36:20.320
pictures from it, and we're making NFTs of it. And at first, I thought it was kind of silly,

01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:25.440
kind of crazy, why would you make an NFT of a physical product or whatever. But the more I

01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:31.440
thought about it, like, what if we could do use blockchain technology and science, not just for

01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:35.600
preserving or maybe maybe we could make a DAO, one of these organizations, these entities to buy

01:36:35.680 --> 01:36:41.760
these books before they get lost or stolen or whatever, a couple hundred thousand dollars to

01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:48.720
get an original one. But what if we could either custodize it or if we could use it to generate

01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:54.400
resources for physics. So I want to run that idea by you, not specifically with my Galileo project,

01:36:55.120 --> 01:37:01.040
but that's just kind of my testing the water with NFTs, but you can find that on my website,

01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:08.000
BrianKating.com. But for a fraction of an ether, but what do you think about NFTs and science?

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:11.680
What do you think about the prospects for using this blockchain technology?

01:37:11.680 --> 01:37:19.200
By any means necessary is where I am at the moment. Malcolm X, I think, was correct that

01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:25.360
we needed to, there's certain things that are just so important that I almost don't care how

01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:34.720
they happen. My hope is that NFTs don't backfire on us because the right thing to do is to make

01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:43.520
very serious people very rich in autonomy so that they never think about, you know, look,

01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:50.320
making somebody a low eight-digit millionaire, double-digit millionaire,

01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:57.280
is probably sufficient to give them an extremely nice life. And there are tons of those

01:37:57.920 --> 01:38:04.560
who do far less for us than the people who do our molecular biology, chemistry,

01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:11.200
mathematics, and physics. So I do think that it's important if we're going to abandon all of our

01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:15.600
culture, we're going to leak everything, we're going to turn the universities into cesspools,

01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:21.520
et cetera, et cetera. We've got to get a few money to the people who built everything for us,

01:38:21.520 --> 01:38:29.680
in my opinion. What I don't want to see is I don't want to see it backfiring.

01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:32.880
I don't want to see a claim, oh, well, you guys have your NFTs, so you're good now.

01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:40.880
It's like, no. We're scrambling because you screwed us over and you're idiots,

01:38:40.880 --> 01:38:47.920
and it's time for you to be ethical and smart. That's a very hard conversation to have.

01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:56.480
If we have to dramatize it by NFTs, so be it. But my feeling is, what if the NFT thing goes

01:38:56.480 --> 01:39:02.000
in different directions? If it goes through to the moon, then it's a great move. What if it goes

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:08.240
in the toilet? And now we've sort of staked our credibility on getting involved in something that

01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:16.640
has a Ponzi scheme built into it. I'm not saying it is a Ponzi scheme. There is Ponzi in NFT,

01:39:16.640 --> 01:39:23.440
just as there is Genius in NFT. I also want to point out that the concept of digital scarcity,

01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:29.280
if you go back to the original blockchain white paper of Satoshi, it's very, very clear that

01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:36.560
it's propagating something according to a conservation law, that you hand me your public key,

01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:43.040
and I've got my private key, and I've got this token that I'm laying claim to. I can propagate

01:39:43.040 --> 01:39:52.880
my token to you in this infinite chain of custody by virtue of the fact that something is conserved.

01:39:52.880 --> 01:40:01.040
Now, of course, you had to create new tokens out of the vacuum. But my belief is, is that one of

01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:05.680
the things is we should be talking about this in terms of digital conservation laws and digital

01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:15.280
physics, and we should be active. And I also think that having been playing with the crypto

01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:19.520
community a little bit, at first, they dismiss everybody because they think you come in from

01:40:19.520 --> 01:40:25.520
outside and you don't care about anything. You just want to tell people things. But we do know

01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:31.840
that there's a lot of homology between Bitcoin and gauge theory,

01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:38.880
conservation principles. Conservation principles have to do with symmetry. I am sure that if you

01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:44.880
and I got roaring drunk for two weeks with a whiteboard, we would come up with a symmetry principle

01:40:45.520 --> 01:40:51.520
for Bitcoin using some version of a discretized nerder's theorem that took the conservation law

01:40:51.520 --> 01:40:56.160
that allows us to propagate, you know, Satoshi's solution of the double spend problem

01:40:56.960 --> 01:41:07.040
is probably worthy of some amazing science prize. It's just an ingenious idea. And it's hard to

01:41:07.040 --> 01:41:14.160
understand what is the substrate of, is it the idea that the individual wallets, the public-private

01:41:14.160 --> 01:41:21.520
key pairs, is it computers and nodes? Because the interesting thing is that it was engineered

01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:27.200
so that nodes could go dark. And, you know, that's like taking a chunk of space time out of commission.

01:41:28.960 --> 01:41:37.040
I think it's really important that physics get involved with NFTs, with conservation laws,

01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:43.280
with digital physics, and actually contribute into the system to make it much more useful.

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:47.920
And while some in the crypto community will say, oh, they're just talking their book and

01:41:48.720 --> 01:41:52.720
to a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail, you know, to a man with a gauge theory,

01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:59.280
everything looks like a conservation law. Just ignore those people. There are so many good people

01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:04.640
in crypto who are interested in any interesting idea. We need to party with them. That's my thought.

01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:11.760
So I want to ask you to look into your crystal ball, and maybe we'll do the the lightening

01:42:11.760 --> 01:42:20.560
round as we like to do, Eric. Are we done with COVID? No. Explain.

01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:27.680
My feeling about this is that probably COVID is much worse than we thought,

01:42:28.640 --> 01:42:33.200
or that we understand, and that people who understood it were protecting us against something.

01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:38.800
I don't know this to be true, but if I had to make a guess. The reason that China is so ferocious

01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:43.280
about trying to stamp COVID out, is that I worry that they know something, that it's not a flu,

01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:50.240
that it's a cumulative flu that destroys you, bout by bout. I don't know what this thing is,

01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:56.480
and I think it's it's criminal that we're so far into this. And we have no idea why China is behaving

01:42:56.480 --> 01:43:02.160
the way it's behaving, or why Fauci behaves the way he behaves, or Peter Dajik, or Ralph Barrick,

01:43:02.160 --> 01:43:07.760
or any of these people. Somehow this COVID is taking place outside of science.

01:43:09.040 --> 01:43:17.680
And it's, I'm worried that we don't understand what COVID is, and we don't know which wave is

01:43:17.680 --> 01:43:23.600
going to is going to hurt and how bad it. I mean, no, I don't think so. I think that

01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:30.880
we decided that we're done with it because Omicron was relatively mild. But what COVID becomes next,

01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:36.480
I worry that certain people have much better understanding than you and I do, and that they

01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:41.840
know why this is so dangerous. I'm worried that they the government lied twice for different reasons.

01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:45.520
The first time I worry that they lied to protect what they were doing with

01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:52.960
DITRA, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency. Why was it working with EcoHealth Alliance Wuhan Lab?

01:43:52.960 --> 01:43:58.320
Why under kindly Dr. Fauci, who seems to have something to do with a weapons portfolio,

01:43:58.960 --> 01:44:03.680
getting around a couple of treaties that we signed and ratified in the 70s. I have no idea.

01:44:03.760 --> 01:44:08.320
But I think that that was a self-protective lying. And then I think that there may have been public

01:44:08.320 --> 01:44:14.640
spirited lying saying if we could have told you what it is that we created in this cauldron,

01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:20.960
we happen to have some inside information about this furan cleavage site and the potential to

01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:27.360
attack T cells and the degradation and why this binds to so many different organs and can cross

01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:32.080
the blood brain. I'm worried that they know that this is a much worse disease than it appears

01:44:32.080 --> 01:44:37.520
and that we're going to find out over time why they were so draconian because it does look like

01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:42.960
that they wildly overreacted, not to say that people didn't die, not to say that this wasn't

01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:49.760
serious, but to shut down the world economy to the extent that they did clearly risked war

01:44:50.800 --> 01:44:58.000
at some level. It wasn't that it was free. And so I'm very worried that we don't really understand

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:04.000
what COVID is and that Omicron seemed kind of relatively mild, but just wait something

01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:09.200
that's going to be wave after wave. And we're going to learn over time what this thing really is.

01:45:10.800 --> 01:45:16.480
Do you see the midterm elections coming off without a hitch? Do you think it'll be a nice,

01:45:16.480 --> 01:45:22.640
smooth orderly? I don't want to say transition to power. I don't want to assume what direction

01:45:22.640 --> 01:45:25.520
the elections are going to go. You think it's going to be a nice, smooth election of ever?

01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:32.720
You're asking one of the middle children what to do about crazy mommy and crazy daddy and my

01:45:32.720 --> 01:45:44.960
feeling is that dad should go off into his meth den and mom should move out of the house with

01:45:44.960 --> 01:45:50.960
her various lovers and the same people who were left should try to get back to the United States

01:45:50.960 --> 01:45:57.040
of America. I don't know how to do this. I view the Republican and Democratic parties as being

01:45:57.040 --> 01:46:04.800
dead-enders. Again, it's the Thelma and Louise problem. Do you decide that Thelma is better than

01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:13.360
Louise if Louise takes longer to hit the ground by a nanosecond? I don't know. I view, I'm so,

01:46:15.200 --> 01:46:18.800
you know what I've become? I've become a tensionist. It's like you've got bloods and

01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:23.760
crypts running your neighborhood and you don't want to go blood or crypt. You just want them to

01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:29.200
fight each other enough so that the rest of you can go to work, go to school, and buy some groceries

01:46:29.200 --> 01:46:38.080
without being terrorized. More upbeat note. Are we headed for an U.S. involvement on the ground

01:46:38.800 --> 01:46:47.600
in the Ukraine? Next question. Are you excited about any recent discoveries in physics? We talked

01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:52.800
about the W Boson mass discrepancy. By the way, it's not that the mass itself is so much higher.

01:46:52.800 --> 01:46:57.440
It's that the precision is so with tension with the standard model. Not that you said that,

01:46:57.440 --> 01:47:02.880
but there are people in the chatroom wondering, is it eight times too high, five sigma? No,

01:47:02.880 --> 01:47:10.640
it's higher. The bounds on this thing are radically, radically tightened up. This is a new data,

01:47:10.720 --> 01:47:18.960
this old data, new analysis. It should be taken with some degree of caution. But to that end,

01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:23.920
people have been speculating about the role of fifth forces and all sorts of things ranging from

01:47:24.880 --> 01:47:31.920
G-2 discrepancy, the magnetic moment of the muon, etc. There are a lot of tensions. I always say

01:47:31.920 --> 01:47:37.120
physicists need a psychologist. I think we've got so much tension on our minds. Where do you think,

01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:42.320
what's exciting you? If you were a young physicist or if you knew a young physicist

01:47:42.320 --> 01:47:48.880
who's starting out, what would you advise her to do? What excites you most in physics?

01:47:49.600 --> 01:47:53.920
A theorist? We should talk about an experimentalist and a theorist. I think we should talk about the

01:47:53.920 --> 01:47:58.880
experimentalist first because I think one of the things that you've done is to emphasize that

01:47:58.880 --> 01:48:05.440
constantly focusing on the lead singer. We're always talking about Mick Jagger and Keith Richards

01:48:05.520 --> 01:48:10.800
holding it down and making the thing awesome. Let's talk evenly about them. What should a

01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:17.120
young experimentalist do? My feeling about that is you should figure out where there might be money

01:48:17.120 --> 01:48:22.480
and where there might be new tools. I would be thinking a lot about high precision experiments.

01:48:22.480 --> 01:48:28.800
I would be thinking a lot about gravitational waves because that's still relatively new. I would

01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:35.440
be thinking a great deal about which of these hints beyond the standard model physics

01:48:38.240 --> 01:48:46.320
might be most promising. How would I go about the G-2 anomaly or the W anomaly or any of the

01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:53.600
other anomalies? What are the tools? The interstitial thing, as you were saying, in some sense,

01:48:53.600 --> 01:49:00.640
new analysis of old data is new data of a kind because we have to process the original raw

01:49:00.640 --> 01:49:08.400
data. It's never pristinely coming from the universe itself directly. What am I super excited

01:49:08.400 --> 01:49:17.520
about? I'm super excited about getting back to the big questions. We traded all of our big questions

01:49:17.520 --> 01:49:21.920
for can you quantize gravity, which assumes that gravity wants to be quantized the way

01:49:21.920 --> 01:49:28.640
everything else wanted to be quantized. I'm tired of talking about white supremacy, but quantum

01:49:28.640 --> 01:49:36.000
supremacy, we can call it quantum maximalism. It's sort of like dealing with Bitcoin maximalists.

01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:42.800
The people with the laser eyes are telling you quantize gravity rather than make the quantum

01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:48.560
more geometric because gravity has always been geometric since Einstein. What I'm super excited

01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:56.320
about in mass is looking at the different ways that mass can be generated inside of the models.

01:49:57.360 --> 01:50:02.160
Let's come up with three separate ways that you can generate mass. One way is that you could have

01:50:02.160 --> 01:50:08.320
more things to differentiate. If a piece of a derivative gains mass by differentiating something

01:50:08.320 --> 01:50:13.840
like a Higgs field, maybe there are multiple Higgs fields and the more mass somehow comes out of a

01:50:13.840 --> 01:50:20.480
richer Higgs sector. That's one of the things that might be interesting. There's a very funny

01:50:20.480 --> 01:50:26.000
result from dimension three. It's peculiar to dimension three called topological mass that was

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:35.760
pioneered by Roman, Jacob and others. That says that if you have a Yang-Mills term, so forgive me,

01:50:36.800 --> 01:50:41.120
if you have a term that looks like this at the top of the cup with the double F's,

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:50.720
and then you add another term that looks a little bit more like a matter equation. It's only got one

01:50:50.720 --> 01:50:56.800
derivative rather than two, sort of like the Dirac equation. It's called the Churn-Simon's term.

01:50:58.400 --> 01:51:03.520
In dimension three, that gives you a new way to generate mass that's not available elsewhere.

01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:12.800
Then there's another way of generating mass, which is seemingly verboten, which is to put in a direct

01:51:12.800 --> 01:51:19.840
mass term for something like the W particle. Rather than a soft mass term, which gains the

01:51:19.840 --> 01:51:30.000
appearance of mass through an interaction. I'll stop using this mug. I believe that in GU there

01:51:30.080 --> 01:51:36.160
are ways to generate mass directly rather than indirectly that don't violate gauge conservation.

01:51:36.880 --> 01:51:45.680
There are three mass mechanism channels that I'm looking at in GU relative to the discovery of

01:51:45.680 --> 01:51:54.800
the W particle. This is something that I was excited about before, but I don't know. What are

01:51:54.800 --> 01:52:00.080
you supposed to say? If everything is working fine, it was an embarrassment that there were these

01:52:00.080 --> 01:52:06.560
extra terms. It's there in the draft. You can see where the mass is generated, but I don't think

01:52:06.560 --> 01:52:13.920
actually I put in the Yang-Millsian part to the draft because of having something to do with the

01:52:13.920 --> 01:52:22.560
Higgs sector, which I'm very excited about. The prospect for generating mass in novel ways,

01:52:23.440 --> 01:52:27.760
I think, I expect to be one of the most exciting things to be coming out.

01:52:29.440 --> 01:52:34.800
Well, on that note, my friend, I want to wish everybody celebrating out there.

01:52:34.800 --> 01:52:40.160
Wait, wait, there was a guitar question. Oh yeah, a guitar question. So you made a guitar question.

01:52:40.160 --> 01:52:51.280
Is the guitar hero dead? It's an interesting puzzle. We just had this dinner where I was

01:52:51.280 --> 01:52:56.320
invited by a guy named Pliny. Yeah, talk about this picture. This guy tattooed everywhere except

01:52:56.320 --> 01:53:02.080
for maybe the whites of his eyes. You're talking about Tim Henson. Oh yeah. Tim Henson is,

01:53:03.200 --> 01:53:08.000
I don't even know how to describe what kind of a wild guitarist he is, but look up Polyphia Goat

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:13.920
for the most famous thing that he did. I give the example. It's sort of like Havana Unana,

01:53:14.480 --> 01:53:21.520
you know, but imagine that you had or like smooth. It's got this kind of a Latin

01:53:23.280 --> 01:53:31.760
rhythm and feel of flow. But imagine that somebody was juggling a Faberge egg, a running chainsaw,

01:53:31.760 --> 01:53:38.960
and a nuclear weapon. And like, it was just incredibly difficult to imagine the different

01:53:38.960 --> 01:53:44.640
things that they had to do when they were catching each one of these things. Tim is mixing up all

01:53:44.640 --> 01:53:54.160
sorts of ingenious, I just love this guy, ingenious ways of taking and deconstructing and

01:53:54.160 --> 01:54:00.320
reconstructing. I want to emphasize reconstructing. Things that our brains and ears want to hear

01:54:00.320 --> 01:54:08.000
and are used to hearing, but need to be made fresh and new. So I think that Tim is one of the most

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:13.520
exciting guitarists out there. But I want to just, I want to flog a bunch of names very quickly,

01:54:13.520 --> 01:54:19.920
people who are exciting me. Pliny's exciting me. Rick Beato is doing amazing things on his channel.

01:54:21.520 --> 01:54:28.800
We are being treated to Mike Dawes and Tommy Immanuel touring the country. Mike Isengur of

01:54:28.800 --> 01:54:36.640
Incubus. John Mayer is one of the most unbelievable pedagogues out there. So he's not only playing

01:54:36.640 --> 01:54:44.480
his heart out with the blues, with the level of people like Joe Bonamassa and other people in

01:54:44.480 --> 01:54:53.760
that idiom guy named Kingfish and Eric Gales and Josh Smith. I'm just naming a bunch of people who,

01:54:53.760 --> 01:54:59.360
if you're not, if you want to get excited again about guitar, listen to these people

01:55:00.240 --> 01:55:10.240
as well as get excited about the gear. What's going on in gear? The folks at Positive Grid just

01:55:10.240 --> 01:55:17.280
sent me a tiny amp that is effectively your charge. You know, it's a little cube, this big,

01:55:17.280 --> 01:55:23.120
and I've got the world's greatest amplifier simulated inside of this tiny little thing.

01:55:23.440 --> 01:55:31.040
What's going on at Neural DSP and their ability to simulate and capture instruments,

01:55:31.040 --> 01:55:36.000
and then you can capture your own amplifier and digitize it.

01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:45.600
So Doug Castro is doing amazing things. The people at High Vibe Acoustic Guitar are blowing my mind

01:55:45.600 --> 01:55:52.720
by putting reverb echo inside a classical instrument effectively, or a wood instrument.

01:55:53.520 --> 01:56:00.640
This is out of France. And what they're doing is turning our, they're blurring the line between

01:56:00.640 --> 01:56:05.040
an electric and acoustic guitar. So you can have distortion on an acoustic guitar because

01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:11.520
it takes the signal in and then it transforms it and then it uses the vibrating wood, which is where

01:56:11.520 --> 01:56:16.960
we hear most of the sound. It's not from the strings, it's from the wood. That stuff is being

01:56:16.960 --> 01:56:24.320
vibrated by these little, I forget, actuators or whatever they could call them. I think guitar is

01:56:24.320 --> 01:56:31.200
incredibly exciting right now, and I think that what we're missing is we're missing spontaneity

01:56:31.200 --> 01:56:36.720
and the blues and whatever it is that caused every show to be wildly different. We have too many

01:56:36.720 --> 01:56:44.560
people practicing very, very carefully. And I'll just shout out Tosin Abasi and Misha Mansour,

01:56:44.560 --> 01:56:51.120
and I'm going to have more to say about this. Got it. Well, Eric, can't thank you enough.

01:56:51.120 --> 01:56:56.160
People are asking you to break out a guitar, but I didn't ask you to plan that out. So unless you

01:56:56.160 --> 01:57:01.280
happen to have a little strat nearby, we'll have to do that next time. And people are asking us to

01:57:01.280 --> 01:57:07.040
go deep into the mug. So I think what we should do next time is explore the mug in some detail. So

01:57:07.040 --> 01:57:12.720
on this channel. I would love to do that. But I would like to get some video aids, and the two

01:57:12.720 --> 01:57:19.200
of us get excited about letting people know here's the recipe for the universe so that maybe not

01:57:19.200 --> 01:57:24.320
everybody becomes a quantum field theorist instantly. But this is the greatest show on earth.

01:57:24.320 --> 01:57:30.320
There's nothing more interesting than this. And you shouldn't get frozen out of it just because

01:57:30.320 --> 01:57:33.680
you didn't math didn't agree with you in high school. So that's what I have to say.

01:57:34.400 --> 01:57:40.080
That's right. So we tied in guitar strings and string theory. So Eric, we do have facilities

01:57:40.080 --> 01:57:44.960
for that. We have an enormous green screen glass whiteboard down here at UC San Diego,

01:57:44.960 --> 01:57:50.320
where you're always welcome. You know where your office is and Japanese whiskey. We have Japanese

01:57:50.320 --> 01:57:56.560
whiskey. We have Cuban cigars. We have giant mushrooms. And we have assorted accoutrements

01:57:56.560 --> 01:58:01.760
to go along with that. I want to notify people next week, there's going to be a big press release

01:58:01.760 --> 01:58:07.360
coming from the event horizon telescope, headed by my friend chef Doleman at Harvard Center for

01:58:07.360 --> 01:58:12.800
Astrophysics. And they're making an announcement involving a black hole in the Milky Way Galaxy.

01:58:12.800 --> 01:58:18.080
Now, I don't know about you, but I have a feeling it has to do with the ginormous six million solar

01:58:18.080 --> 01:58:23.600
mass at the center of black hole, the black hole, the black hole unless they've discovered another

01:58:23.600 --> 01:58:27.200
black hole. And that would be almost you don't know what this announcement is. Are you teasing us?

01:58:27.200 --> 01:58:32.560
Do you actually know announcement of a press conference coming on Thursday next week, the 12th

01:58:32.560 --> 01:58:41.920
of May? I have a video queued up. I've done an interview. I don't know. I have my very strong

01:58:41.920 --> 01:58:48.240
suspicions. And so I will have a video out that day about the results on this channel. So I hope

01:58:48.240 --> 01:58:53.680
people will subscribe. I do a lot of introductory kind of physics videos, but I do a lot of advanced

01:58:53.680 --> 01:58:58.720
physics and take the experimentalist tack. As Eric said, I love to go deep dive. I love my

01:58:58.720 --> 01:59:03.280
theorist friends. My best friends are theorists, including Eric and Stefan. Would you want your

01:59:03.280 --> 01:59:13.600
daughter to marry one? I would allow one of them. But in the same token. Experimentalists need some

01:59:13.600 --> 01:59:19.200
love, too. The unsung exterminators of all theories in the universe. So for now, and I wish you all

01:59:20.080 --> 01:59:26.640
a fruitful Cinco de Mayo. We're going to go out drinking next time we're together, some tequila,

01:59:26.640 --> 01:59:34.320
and we'll have to avoid the anomalous worms. So I want to wish everybody that and tune in next

01:59:34.320 --> 01:59:39.680
time to the Into the Impossible podcast with your fearful host, Dr. Brian Keating, and his

01:59:39.680 --> 01:59:44.560
friendly friend, Eric. You're looking wonderful. Can't wait to we're in person and all seriousness.

01:59:44.560 --> 01:59:50.560
Miss you, buddy. Been too long. All right, brother. Best to everybody. And I'll talk to you soon. Bye.

01:59:50.560 --> 01:59:54.480
Thanks, friend.
