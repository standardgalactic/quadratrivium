00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,260
Case Western Reserve University's Institute for the Science of Origins proudly presents

2
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:09,040
the Origins Science Scholars Program.

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,100
The Institute advances the scientific understanding and application of origins and evolution of

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,100
human and natural systems.

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,900
The Origins Science Scholars Lectures are presented with the assistance of Case Western

6
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:25,100
Reserve University's Segal Lifelong Learning Program, College of Arts and Sciences, and

7
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,100
Media Vision.

8
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:31,120
This evening, it's my pleasure to welcome Professor Joseph Lamana, the Gene M. and

9
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:36,480
Joseph S. Silber Professor of Brain Sciences, and Professor in the Department of Physiology

10
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,480
and Biophysics.

11
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:43,040
Professor Lamana is an expert on blood flow and metabolism in the brain, on the adaptation

12
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,760
to hypoxia, which is the lack of oxygen.

13
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,960
He served as president of several learned societies, and it's my pleasure to welcome

14
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,040
here tonight to talk about the origin of mitochondria.

15
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,640
Please join me in welcoming Professor Silber.

16
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:06,160
Today we're talking about mitochondria, and it's going to be in three parts.

17
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,480
The first is going to be about the origin of life.

18
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:14,600
We can't talk about the origin of mitochondria without talking about the origin of life.

19
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,280
You'll see why shortly.

20
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,720
Part two will be about the origin of mitochondria themselves, and then the three will see how

21
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:28,840
they had a role in the development and evolution of multicellular animals.

22
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,840
To begin with, we have to talk about the time frame.

23
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:39,320
This is called the biogeologic clock, and it breaks up the four plus billion years of

24
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:48,280
earth history into a nice circle, which shows that for most of the existence of the earth,

25
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,600
there was not multicellular animals.

26
00:01:51,600 --> 00:02:01,880
So we have first is the period here where the earth is formed, and it's beginning to

27
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:10,140
cool, and within a billion years or so, we have the origin of life, the first evidence

28
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:15,760
that life exists there, and then for most of the existence, most of these billion years

29
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,840
after that, there's not much in the way of multicellular life.

30
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:30,120
So the single cell life began almost as soon as the earth was cool enough for life to occur.

31
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,720
So we're going to look at when it began, the conditions under which it began, and some

32
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:41,040
leading hypotheses about what generated life to begin with, and then what changed, how

33
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,280
the conditions changed.

34
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,280
Important to all of this is the consideration of energy.

35
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:54,240
That's the ability to generate and manipulate energy that defines life.

36
00:02:54,240 --> 00:03:02,080
The basic ingredients for life, once the conditions cool on earth enough so that the chemicals

37
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,480
remain stable, you need energy, which can be in the form of light, heat, or chemical

38
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,560
energy.

39
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,080
You need the chemical components.

40
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,760
These are the molecules, organic molecules.

41
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,880
They had to come from somewhere, and they had to get there first.

42
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,520
And then you need water, and so that's part of the conditions on earth had to be cool

43
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:29,160
enough for liquid water to be available.

44
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:38,280
So to get right to it, we have evidence from microbial mats of life existing at about three

45
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,240
and a half billion years, pretty strong evidence.

46
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:49,240
We have the earliest physical evidence at about 3.7, but we also have a theoretical

47
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:54,760
belief or theoretical understanding that life could have occurred in hydrothermal vents

48
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,360
at about four billion years ago.

49
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:03,080
And this is a description of the eons of the earth showing these particular eons.

50
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:09,920
We have the Hadean eon named for Hades, as you might expect, because apparently the conditions

51
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:16,400
there are what we think of as hell, with the sulfurous volcanoes and bubbling molten magma.

52
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,000
And then you have the Archaian period, and this is the period under which life first

53
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,360
arose.

54
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:27,960
You have then a long period of time in the protozoic, which single cell life in the beginning

55
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:34,320
of multicellularity, but not much in complexity, and then the Phanerozoic, which really means

56
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,280
the obvious life period of time.

57
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,320
What we notice here, I just want to mention this, this LHB is the late heavy bombardment,

58
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:51,880
and that's a period of time when there were lots of meteorites hitting the planet earth,

59
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:57,880
and these carried with it water, and they also, I see meteorites brought water, and also

60
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:05,680
meteorites carried organic compounds, and we know from the meteorites that we've seen

61
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,400
recently that if we calculate how much organic materials in a meteorite, and how many meteorites

62
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:18,280
there were, there's plenty of possibility for carrying most organic life, organic compounds

63
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,640
to earth by meteorites.

64
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:27,840
And then you have the rise, right at about 3.6, 3.7, of bacterium archaea, which are

65
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:35,360
the prokaryotes, they are single celled organisms, and they arose under conditions without oxygen.

66
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,800
That's the most important thing.

67
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,360
The atmosphere initially contained just hydrogen and helium, that's because most of the universe

68
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:49,200
is hydrogen and helium, so when the earth coalesced first, that was the natural compounds

69
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,360
in the environment.

70
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:56,160
They're too light to stay on the earth though, earth's gravity cannot hold the light gases,

71
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,040
and so both hydrogen and helium will leave the atmosphere reasonably quickly, and the

72
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:09,040
atmosphere then becomes a mixture of what comes out of the volcanic vents, lots of volcanic

73
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:15,720
gases, mostly steam and water vapor, carbon dioxide, plenty of carbon dioxide, you have

74
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:21,600
sulfur and nitrogen, plus the trace gases, the noble gases that don't react so much,

75
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,880
the argon and the neon, you have a little bit of methane, a little bit of carbon monoxide

76
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,080
and hydrogen.

77
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,120
Now what we were taught in school, probably when you took biology, you were taught the

78
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:42,000
primordial atmosphere consisted of hydrogen, ammonia, methane, water and hydrogen sulfide,

79
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:49,960
which are the most reduced forms of the biological elements, nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen and sulfur,

80
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,420
or oxygen and sulfur.

81
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:57,800
This has to be revised a little bit because under those conditions that we now know to

82
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:06,280
be present, there could not be much ammonia or methane, they would have been further metabolized,

83
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:13,640
but so we add nitrogen instead of ammonia and we add carbon dioxide instead of methane,

84
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:18,760
and the UV light will be breaking down some of the water vapor into a little bit of oxygen,

85
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:24,840
but as soon as any oxygen will be made, it will react with minerals in the crust of the

86
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,880
earth and be pulled out of the atmosphere, and the hydrogen that was left would also

87
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:36,520
leave via the kinetic energy in insufficient gravity.

88
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:41,320
But the most important thing is that this was in a reducing atmosphere, no oxygen, or

89
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:46,680
less than one part per million oxygen, very low oxygen, and it seems like that's a requirement

90
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,320
for life to have a reason.

91
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:54,820
Now there's lots of theories on the origin of life, it's been discussed for as long

92
00:07:54,900 --> 00:08:01,540
as people have been around, they've discussed origins, and you remember also from your biology

93
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:08,740
about theories of spontaneous generation and life from non-life that were discussed prior

94
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:13,440
to people like Pasteur who showed that this was not possible.

95
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:19,860
We had Darwin talk about the warm little pond which got sunlight, which had some organic

96
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:23,160
chemicals on which life could arise from there.

97
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:30,480
We had the experiments of people like Miller and Ure and Fox, which took the elements expected

98
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:36,760
of the primordial atmosphere, put electrical sparks in, and got organic compounds out of

99
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,240
it.

100
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:46,040
We also have hypotheses where these organic compounds could line up on community clay,

101
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:53,880
this is clay along the beach, that would act as a place for to catalyze reactions among

102
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,680
these compounds.

103
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:02,040
The Chile start hypothesis, which if you had the snowball earth and a frozen seas, would

104
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:09,360
protect the ocean from UV light and allow the chemicals to react and form life.

105
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,560
A radioactive beach hypothesis, this is radioactive chemicals along the shoreline producing the

106
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,080
heat necessary to provide the energy for this.

107
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,800
I mentioned meteorites being able to provide organic compounds.

108
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:28,480
More recently, they only were discovered in the 70s, some hydrothermal vents, deep sea

109
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:36,200
vents, when these deep sea submersibles started exploring the sea bottom, and they found these

110
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:41,240
areas where obvious venting was coming from the sea floor, and lo and behold, there were

111
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:49,320
things living there, way out of the sunlight, at 100 atmospheres of pressure, at temperatures

112
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:55,840
approaching 200 degrees C, and amazing, we call those extremophiles, that is organisms

113
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,400
that live in extreme environments.

114
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:06,360
These were suggested to people like Gunter Wachteschauser, that life might have originated

115
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:13,560
there, making use of the iron and sulfur minerals as catalysts.

116
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:18,880
The black smokers had sulfide, they were very close to the magma and very hot, the white

117
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:25,800
smokers a little further away, a little cooler, a little more alkaline, and there was hydrogen

118
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:32,080
available to get energy from, and the idea that hydrogen metabolism may have been the

119
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:39,000
first energy available for life to arise, and of course any or all of these might be

120
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,320
contributing, that is a multiple genesis hypothesis.

121
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:54,440
Now once you had life, part of the chemical process using getting energy from hydrogen

122
00:10:54,440 --> 00:11:01,600
and methane and carbon dioxide produced oxygen as a byproduct, so this is, in a reducing

123
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:08,640
anoxic environment, oxygen being released as a waste product is a toxic product.

124
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:20,240
So as the environment gathered more and more oxygen, there would be adaptations to make

125
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,560
use of this toxic waste product in a positive way.

126
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:34,240
Before oxygen could accumulate, it had to react with all of the reduced iron that was

127
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,680
floating around in the oceans.

128
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:44,120
The oceans were filled with a soluble form of reduced iron, ferrous iron, and as the

129
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:49,720
oxygen came into the environment, it would react with the iron, oxidize it, and this

130
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,120
is, well, this is rust.

131
00:11:52,120 --> 00:12:00,720
So you had to rust all of the iron in the ocean, and that iron doesn't, it's not dissolved,

132
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:09,040
it sinks, and so these thick bands of, red bands of rust accumulated at the floor of

133
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:15,640
the oceans, we call these banded iron formations, and it allows us to pinpoint fairly accurately

134
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:22,400
when the oxygen was produced and when the oxygen was accumulating in the environment.

135
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:28,080
We know, and this is a banded iron, example of a banded iron formation from the American

136
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:32,280
Museum of Natural History in New York, but there's an example in our Natural History

137
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,760
Museum, it used to be out front, I don't know where it is now, but it used to be right

138
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:41,400
out front door as you walked in every day.

139
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:48,680
So this indicates prodigious amounts of oxygen being generated during this three billion

140
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,920
years ago to two and a half billion years ago.

141
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,720
These banded iron formations are about two and a half billion years old in the middle

142
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:04,360
on average, and at the end of this period of time we come to very close to our current

143
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:10,120
atmosphere, which is an oxidizing atmosphere, with one-fifth of it being oxygen, most of

144
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:18,680
the rest being nitrogen, a little bit of carbon dioxide, and there are trace noble gases.

145
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,920
Where did that oxidizing event come from?

146
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:26,840
We call it the great oxidizing event, GOE, and the best guess here is the evolution

147
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:35,080
of cyanobacteria, so these are bacteria, single cell animals, which we used to call blue-green

148
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:39,840
algae when we were growing up, but they're not algae, they're bacteria, and they kind

149
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,440
of look like this.

150
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:46,140
This is a picture of cyanobacterium.

151
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:52,000
They grow in these mats, these are current mats that are available in Western Australia,

152
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:59,920
and those are layer upon layer of cyanobacterial mats producing oxygen.

153
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:07,040
These also, these cells, these single cell bacteria became the precursors of the chloroplast,

154
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,720
which is the organelle in plants that does photosynthesis and gives us oxygen today,

155
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:15,200
so that's the precursor of all plants.

156
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:21,400
What happens then, the history of oxygen on Earth winds up this way, very low amounts

157
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:26,920
for the first two billion years, the great oxidizing event occurs, but notice that this

158
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:35,080
is a log scale, this is one percent of the current atmospheric level, one percent of

159
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:42,760
that would be 0.2 percent of oxygen in the atmosphere, not 20 percent, so 20 percent

160
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:48,880
is what we have now, this is a much, still a very small amount, so for two billion years

161
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:56,920
oxygen was a very low level, and this is a time when mitochondria started to produce

162
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:07,680
multicellular animals, and we will talk about the more current time period for oxygen in

163
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:14,240
part three, but right now I'd like to just summarize part one here and then stop for

164
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:20,720
some questions, and the basic points that I've mentioned are that single cell prokaryotes

165
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:27,360
arise about four billion years ago in the absence of oxygen, and then cyanobacteria begin

166
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,680
to add oxygen resulting in the great oxidation event, 2.5 billion years ago as the environment

167
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,800
shifts from no oxygen to some oxygen.

168
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:42,240
One of the earlier slides you showed the meteorites and one of the chirality, what's the Italian

169
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,240
there?

170
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:48,840
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, in the organic compounds that we use, the sugars, the amino acids, some

171
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:54,200
of them are asymmetric, that is they have a left handed form and a right handed form,

172
00:15:54,200 --> 00:16:00,880
and the biology tends to use one or the other, in the carbohydrates it's mostly the D form,

173
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:08,240
the right hand form, and amino acids tends to be the L form, what happened, the chemically

174
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:13,800
they're exactly the same, so how did we get to choose one over the other, because biologically

175
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:18,680
you can only use one because enzymes are like a glove in a hand, you can't put a left

176
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,200
hand glove on a right hand.

177
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:28,280
And it turns out that in the meteorites there's a chiral preference as well, it indicates

178
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:36,880
that possibly we get the preference from the delivery of these compounds from space.

179
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:45,440
Because you can look, they've examined meteorites for example in Antarctica, in a sterile environment,

180
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:52,720
and then they analyze them and they find that they have organic compounds.

181
00:16:52,720 --> 00:17:00,400
Is it fair to say that the low oxygen level in early days was basically until the ferrous

182
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:08,720
iron got used up and became from abundant trace levels and at that point the oxygen

183
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:18,880
began, it would seem to be that for the species present to survive you had to remove oxygen

184
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:25,320
somehow, and that transition not only in the percent oxygen would be a great evolutionary

185
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:29,040
driver to things that could tolerate oxygen.

186
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:35,760
Absolutely, rise of oxygen gives you the rise of diversity and multicellularity, the iron

187
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:41,200
had to go, but also the iron reacts with, I mean sorry, the oxygen reacts with the carbon

188
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,840
compounds as well, it's carbonates and things like that.

189
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:51,680
So as the, and oxidations of the minerals in the rocks, these all get buried, but there's

190
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:57,000
a cycle as they rise and get weathered that gets released back into the atmosphere, so

191
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,680
there's a long term cycle there as well.

192
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:09,400
And later on, when the iron is gone, there still is a reaction with all the carbon because

193
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:14,640
the animals take the carbon and make carbon dioxide out of it by burning it with oxygen,

194
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,680
so there's a balance between oxygen utilization and plants making the oxygen.

195
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:27,000
And you had very large amounts of carbon containing organisms to allow oxygen to build up to large

196
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
levels.

197
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,400
If you get to the last slide or two, you'll see what I mean by that.

198
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,800
Thank you for joining us.

199
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:38,840
You've been watching Dr. Joe Lamana discussing the origin of life and prokaryotic cells, those

200
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,760
lacking at distinct nucleus.

201
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:44,920
For more information on the Origins Science Scholars Program, please visit the institute's

202
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:49,920
website at origins.case.edu.

203
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:55,480
In the next part of the talk, Dr. Lamana discusses the origin of mitochondria and of eukaryotic

204
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,880
cells, those with nuclei.

205
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,000
Now back to the talk.

206
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,680
This is the, this is probably, this is the heart of the talk, this is the origin of mitochondria.

207
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:11,880
Mitochondria are the cells engine that's where all cells, all eukaryote cells mean they

208
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,880
have a nucleus.

209
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,640
All multicellular organisms are eukaryotic.

210
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:25,560
All animals, all plants, all fungi are all organisms that have mitochondria.

211
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,840
And the mitochondria that they have are all related.

212
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:33,680
That's why we know that this event occurred only once and we all have the same related

213
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,080
mitochondria.

214
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,920
So let's move along.

215
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,760
All cells need energy to function.

216
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,560
All cells use the same organelle.

217
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,520
That's the mitochondria.

218
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:49,880
And the kind of the currency, the energy currency of the biology is adenosine triphosphate,

219
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,880
ATP.

220
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:56,040
It has a high energy phosphate on the third one and enzymes that can take that phosphate

221
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:02,560
off also get a lot of energy from it and ATP becomes ADP, diphosphate from triphosphate

222
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,480
and you get a lot of energy from it.

223
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,520
And the mitochondria takes the ADP, makes ATP for us.

224
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,440
And it looks something like this, kind of looks like a bacterium and that was obvious

225
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,640
to the people who first saw them.

226
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:23,200
It's double membrane organism, like a bacterial cell, and it's got its own genetic material

227
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:30,040
in it as well as the ability to make its own proteins, got ribosomes and the ability to

228
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,040
make its own proteins.

229
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,960
I'll talk more about how this works a little bit later in part three.

230
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:41,440
But in most typical eukaryotic cells have the nucleus, which is number two here, followed

231
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:48,280
by number five, which is a lot of the protein making machinery, this is Golgi apparatus.

232
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:53,080
But here's our friend, the mitochondrion, which is providing the energy for all the

233
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,720
work done by the eukaryotic cells.

234
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:01,160
And eukaryotic cells are about 10 times bigger than bacteria, because bacteria about the

235
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,080
same size as mitochondria.

236
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,680
So you get an idea of the size orientation.

237
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:16,560
They were originally seen by histologists who were, these are just barely at the edge

238
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:20,760
of visibility in a light level microscope.

239
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:25,760
And people like Altman thought they looked like bacteria.

240
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,840
It wasn't sure whether they were bacteria, but they looked like bacteria.

241
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,640
He referred to them as bioblasts.

242
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:39,840
Here they were named mitochondria from the Greek, which means thread-like granules, because

243
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:47,400
as Benda looked at it, he saw that they were connected with little bulges on them, looked

244
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:51,600
like a thread that had granules along it.

245
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:59,040
And it was known from biological dyes that they were associated with living cells.

246
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,360
You couldn't stain them if the cell was dead.

247
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,640
If the cell was alive, they took up this dye.

248
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:11,680
And because of that, it was suggested that they were involved in the oxygen respiration,

249
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,640
that is, the utilization of oxygen to make energy.

250
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:21,000
And it was really confirmed after World War II by a lender who wrote the classic textbook

251
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:29,920
on biochemistry that, indeed, this is the organelle that makes ATP from oxygen and substrate.

252
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:37,800
There's a whole story involved in the electron transport chain that's maybe for another time.

253
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:47,400
Now in the mid-60s, Lynn Margulis proposed that these mitochondria not only looked like

254
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,680
bacteria, but they must have come from, they must be bacteria.

255
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:59,600
And so she proposed the bacterial origin of mitochondria and was able to publish her

256
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:05,600
paper in the Journal of Theoretical Biology in 1967 using her married name.

257
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,600
She was married to Carl Sagan.

258
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,480
So Lynn Sagan published this.

259
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:17,600
It was rejected in 14 journals before it was published in the Journal of Theoretical Biology

260
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:22,080
because it was a crazy idea of mitochondria coming from bacteria.

261
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,320
But they look like bacteria.

262
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,880
They have the same genetic base pair distribution.

263
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:36,480
New karyotic cells have more of the AT base pair than the CG, but bacterial and mitochondrial

264
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,480
DNA have equal amounts of those pairs.

265
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,160
They have no histones.

266
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,080
They don't fold up.

267
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,800
They have a different ribosome to make protein from.

268
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:52,720
And in every case, the bacterial and the mitochondrial are identical.

269
00:23:52,720 --> 00:24:01,120
So we have come to understand that Lynn Margulis was indeed correct and mitochondria started

270
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,320
out as bacteria.

271
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:12,280
And the idea was an archaea, a protea, it's another prokaryote, but not a bacterium, an

272
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,280
archaea.

273
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:19,800
It's a different domain of life, had different characteristics, engulfed a proteobacterium.

274
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:26,160
The proteobacterium was able to resist the digestive attempts of the archaea.

275
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,960
And then a symbiotic relationship occurred.

276
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:35,680
They had different metabolic processes that turned out to be synergistic.

277
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:40,720
This may or may not have happened quite a few times, but at least one time it worked

278
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,640
so well that it dominated life from then on.

279
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:51,520
So you have the generation of the first eukaryote cell.

280
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:59,560
And it required a nucleus to occur to sequester the DNA from the host cell so that it wouldn't

281
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:03,200
mix up too badly with the DNA from the bacterium.

282
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:11,000
But a lot of eukaryote DNA comes from bacterial sources.

283
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:18,920
Just on the DNA differences, a nuclear DNA made with base pairs, coils and then coils

284
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:23,360
again and then the coils coil and the coils coil again, and it's covered with histones

285
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:29,520
that keep it from just generating all kinds of mRNA until it's needed.

286
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:37,360
Whereas bacterial cells like this E. coli have these plasmids, these kind of circles of DNA

287
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:41,960
that are same as mitochondria.

288
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:49,440
Now the nuclear DNA in each cell, human cell, there's about 10 feet of DNA if you stretch

289
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,960
it out in each cell.

290
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,000
So you took all your DNA and stretched out end to end.

291
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,120
You could go back and forth to the moon 70 times.

292
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:04,880
That's a lot of DNA coiled up very tightly in each cell.

293
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:10,000
On the other hand, and there's only one copy per cell.

294
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:16,000
In mitochondria, mitochondria have smaller genomes, only 13 genes.

295
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,200
Those bacteria that became mitochondria have lost a lot of their genes.

296
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:25,600
And there's 5 to 10 copies, these plasmids, in each mitochondrian.

297
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,600
And there's multiple mitochondria, maybe hundreds per cell.

298
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:38,040
So there's a lot of copies of the mitochondrial genome that mitochondria can divide independently.

299
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:45,520
And the copies of the DNA can be reproduced fairly quickly compared to the nuclear DNA.

300
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:51,080
So as I say, the mitochondrial genome, it's kind of a circular plasmid type DNA, and it

301
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:58,640
has 13 to 20 genes that are the minimum required for the mitochondria to control certain of

302
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,920
its functions locally.

303
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:07,160
The reason it does it is that sometimes the mitochondria can be very far from the cell

304
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,160
nucleus.

305
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:13,640
Imagine a nerve cell where the nucleus is in the spinal cord and the axon goes all the

306
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,560
way down to the big toe.

307
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:20,320
That's a long distance away from the nucleus if you depend upon the nucleus to be making

308
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,000
the proteins you need.

309
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,000
And also to be able to respond to local energy demand, you need local control.

310
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:35,080
So the significance of mitochondrial DNA is we get all our mitochondria from our mothers.

311
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:40,600
The egg has the mitochondria, the sperm uses all the mitochondria it has, its energy to

312
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:48,160
get to the egg, but only one set of mitochondria are left.

313
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:56,160
And we can use that evidence to look at, by looking at rates of mitochondrial mutation,

314
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:00,200
to predict when the first human mitochondria appeared.

315
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:07,440
And that would have been in our maternal line, so we call that first human eve, and we think

316
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:12,560
maybe it was 170,000 years ago, although there's a lot of speculation, there's a lot of work

317
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,240
that goes into this.

318
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,280
It's not a done story by any means.

319
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:21,560
And also mitochondria help control what we call apoptosis.

320
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:26,040
This is a Greek word that refers to things like where the leaves fall off the trees in

321
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,040
the autumn.

322
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:34,400
It's a programmed cell death, or it's like a cell suicide, and this is triggered when

323
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:41,080
the energy capacity or the energy system, the mitochondria, gets so damaged that they

324
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:46,320
can no longer provide energy for the cell, then they trigger the death of the cell so

325
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:51,680
that it can be phagocytized and doesn't gum up the work, so to speak.

326
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:57,680
And it's also very important to study the mitochondrial DNA as we get towards understanding

327
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,920
mitochondrial aging.

328
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:06,840
And Nick Lane, who is a good scientist and also a good writer, this is an interesting

329
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:12,440
book on the subject, if you're interested, called Power Sex and Suicide, and it's all

330
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,360
about mitochondria.

331
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:23,680
And he's pointing out that the fact that life occurred almost immediately when it was

332
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:29,400
available in its single cell form was not that remarkable, but multicellularity depended

333
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:36,760
upon a unique event, and that is a synergistic endosymbiosis to have it occurred.

334
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:41,880
Once it occurred, it only happened that once, while mitochondria are related.

335
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,400
We think it comes from purple bacteria.

336
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:54,320
These have a chlorophyll-like substance, they have different colors in them, they can't

337
00:29:54,320 --> 00:30:00,240
live with oxygen, they use sulfur for their energy system.

338
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:05,560
And the other side of it is the archaea, these are what would be called the pioneer

339
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:09,600
organism in the iron sulfur world theory.

340
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:14,520
These are methane, these are methanogens, meaning they make methane, they get their

341
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:21,080
energy from CO2 and hydrogen, but the problem is hydrogen is scarce, so finding sources

342
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:26,160
of hydrogen is crucial for these cells.

343
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:30,280
They're not bacteria and they're not eukaryotes, they have a different cell membrane, it's

344
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:36,760
polysaccharitic, and they can go anywhere because they make their own energy from light

345
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,360
or from chemical processes.

346
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:45,640
These are some of the places where they occur.

347
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:53,280
These are the black smokers, they're black because they have sulfur compounds, they exist

348
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:59,680
near magma in the deep ocean trenches, this is where the continents are pulling apart,

349
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:06,680
the plates are moving apart, magma heats the water, spews all kinds of minerals here, it's

350
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:12,480
very rich in minerals, there's no oxygen but there's plenty of other sources of chemical

351
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,080
energy and of course you have thermal energy.

352
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:22,760
And if you look at the one on the right, there's tube worms and what are called squat

353
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:29,920
lobsters, I don't know, but these are deep sea vents located maybe at two and three kilometers

354
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:37,000
depth, so a hundred atmospheres pressure where the water maybe four or five hundred

355
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:43,400
degrees in the case of the black smoker, it's still liquid because of the pressure, and

356
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:51,240
it's a very acidic environment, that was for the black smokers, I just said most of this.

357
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:57,280
The first one was discovered in 1977 as these underwater submarines started looking at mapping

358
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:06,720
the seabed as a source of the iron and nickel, the reduced forms and chemosynthetic bacteria

359
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:18,320
live in these, this one didn't come up, there it is, the white smoker, these were discovered

360
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:23,240
only in 2000, these are a little further away from the trench so the water is cooler, these

361
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:28,880
are steam that's bubbling up through the rock, instead of big holes they're from little

362
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:35,400
porous labyrinthine tubes which produce lots of surface area for chemical reactions to

363
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:49,560
occur and they're more alkaline than acidic and it's thought that these, the life that's

364
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:56,040
here represents some of the organisms that we're familiar with, lots of barium, calcium,

365
00:32:56,040 --> 00:33:07,520
silicon, they make serpentinite, this is a compound of iron and magnesium and barium

366
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:15,320
and calcium that has green, looks like green snakes running through it, today you can find

367
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:21,960
these type of archaea in places like Yellowstone National Park, Yellowstone National Park,

368
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:31,840
this is one of the geysers, it's a hot spring and it shows the steam coming out of the center

369
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:41,600
of it here, yeah, but all along the side this color, the orange color is coming from the algae,

370
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:47,800
the bacteria and the archaea and these are like, again like the purple bacteria, these are

371
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:53,280
carotenoids and bacterial chlorophylls and the colors change with the temperature and the

372
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:59,400
seasons and so sometimes they're more purple or green and sometimes more orange depends on the

373
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:12,120
conditions, very very colorful, so basically in part two what we have is we have the event

374
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:21,760
that occurred, we have the last eukaryotic common ancestor that is the eukaryote cell that joined

375
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:32,320
an archaea with a proteobacterium that became the precursor cell of all eukaryotes going towards

376
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:40,440
the future and all these, there are three domains of life, the bacterial domain, the archaean domain

377
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:51,080
and the eukaryote domain and the eukaryote domain produces plants, animals, fungi and all life

378
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:59,640
from eukaryote domain has mitochondria that allows them to take advantage of the changes in the

379
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:08,200
environment that we're occurring and to grow into multicellular organisms and animals, so I would

380
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:18,680
stop here and take some questions about mitochondrial origins. What has to happen to the bacteria? One

381
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:27,800
thing it has to be able to resist being digested is food by the archaean engulfer and then it has to

382
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:35,240
keep from poisoning the genes of the archaean, remember the archaean engulfer doesn't have a

383
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:40,760
nucleus and so its genes are floating around and now when the bacterial releases their genes they

384
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:46,520
get mixed up and most of the time that's going to be disastrous and so a lot of those engulfments

385
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:53,880
that would normally have occurred are going to be worthless, damaging rather than productive, so it

386
00:35:53,880 --> 00:36:01,080
had to be a very tricky event that occurred that allowed the bacteria to first survive and then

387
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:07,800
figure out how to keep its DNA from getting too mixed up with the other cells DNA. Have scientists

388
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:19,320
now been able to do this in a laboratory setting put an archaean and a proteal bacteria together?

389
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:26,680
Actually that has been seen in nature and in the lab they haven't made mitochondria but there are

390
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:36,760
examples of symbiotic endosymbiotic organisms existing today. Could you make a comment about

391
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:43,800
the variation in the structure of mitochondria of one species compared to another and this refers

392
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:52,760
again to this question of mitochondrial eave you know and whether you know you can have a continuous

393
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:59,240
feed of mitochondria from other species into another. Mitochondria are more similar than they are

394
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:07,000
different. The genes that encode the local proteins and also a lot of the proteins that come from the

395
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:17,720
nucleus those genes can vary but the proteins that they're producing are identical so almost all

396
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:26,600
mitochondria are just mitochondria. Now there's local changes that can change them to a certain

397
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:30,840
extent but they have about the they all have the cytochrome chain the electron transport chain

398
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:36,120
they have about the same density of energy production the same sizes they're they're more

399
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:41,400
similar than than people are similar to each other mitochondria from all different organisms.

400
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:49,080
By looking at the ultra structure picture of a mitochondrian you couldn't tell where it came

401
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:57,480
when they do investigation like for my sister's a brother we share the same mitochondria right

402
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:02,200
you got from your mother yes from my mother right so

403
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:11,800
when you go back to eave right and we go back to all these various things that the

404
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:19,000
you know anthropologists find at the natural history museum those those humans do they have

405
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:25,720
the same mitochondria or that hundred and seventy thousand year thing is set in stone and you cannot

406
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:31,160
so every once in a while there would be a mutation that would change one of the base pairs

407
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:37,080
and might not affect the protein too much it might be in a non-coding area just like in the

408
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:44,840
nuclear uh uh genome so you can watch that you you can look at that going backwards you get the

409
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:52,360
types uh and and you could follow the changes in in the populations of mitochondria going back

410
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:58,120
you could see how often the change occurs and then you could predict how far back the first one had

411
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:05,400
to be uh for this particular lineage. We hope you've been enjoying the origin science scholars

412
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:11,720
program with Dr. Joe Lamana. Dr. Lamana is a Janet M and Joseph S Silver Professor for the

413
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:17,800
study of brain sciences at Case Western Reserve University. In the second part of our talk we

414
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:23,400
learned how early bacteria were taken up by prokaryotic cells and eventually became the cellular

415
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:30,200
powerhouses we know as mitochondria. In our final segment Dr. Lamana will discuss the role of oxygen

416
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:37,240
and mitochondria in the evolution of multicellular organisms. Now back to our talk. All right let's move

417
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:44,280
to uh part three then and uh this involves uh it's a little jumpy here it's got the role of

418
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:50,920
mitochondria so we got some examples of how mitochondria participate and the role of oxygen

419
00:39:50,920 --> 00:40:00,040
as the mitochondrial partner in in evolution and in extreme examples of energy consumption.

420
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:07,720
So here's our mitochondrion again and the what we're going to talk about is to show

421
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:14,920
how the mitochondrion can go about generating energy in a in a very

422
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:23,320
uh uh outline form that I think it will make it uh understandable. Basically what the mitochondrion

423
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:31,960
does is it takes the hydrogen that we get from eating food and it burns it with oxygen that we

424
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:37,080
get from breathing it in from the atmosphere and when you burn the hydrogen with the oxygen

425
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:43,240
you get a tremendous amount of energy from that uh and that energy then gets transferred into

426
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:50,200
ATP molecules that the cells can then use to do the work of the cell. So the first step is getting

427
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:58,840
the hydrogen that's done through uh the uh tca tricarboxylic acid cycle that was this that was

428
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:04,600
worked out by Hans Krebs, Sir Hans Krebs in Oxford and sometimes called the Krebs cycle

429
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:11,400
and I'm showing Sir Hans in a in a standard biochemistry joke of Hans Krebs riding a cycle

430
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:18,760
so it could be Hans Krebs cycle uh it's required of all biochemists I think to make that joke

431
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:27,720
but basically the hydrogen from sugar comes in it's converted through this cycle of compounds

432
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:34,360
and enzymes and the hydrogen is transferred to the mitochondrion and this is where the

433
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:39,880
carbon dioxide comes from so in changing getting the hydrogen from the food the carbon dioxide

434
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:44,840
is pulled off the molecules so we breathe out the carbon dioxide and the hydrogen is passed

435
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:50,680
on to the mitochondrion and then here's where the magic occurs we have a number of compartments

436
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:58,520
in the mitochondrion so let me spend just a few minutes with this diagram it's a it's two membranes

437
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:05,880
two membranes an outer membrane that's here number two is the outer membrane and an inner membrane

438
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:13,560
and that means that there's then two spaces that are important there's the intermembrane space

439
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:18,360
between the inner and outer membrane and then there's the space that is completely

440
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:24,440
surrounded by the inner membrane we call this the matrix and it's in the matrix that the

441
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:31,080
Krebs cycle is working to make the hydrogen available and that the cytochrome chain which is

442
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:37,320
a number of these proteins lined up one after another the job that they do is to separate

443
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:44,120
the electron from the proton because hydrogen is a proton and electron and so the hydrogen

444
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:50,600
proton goes out into the intermembrane space and the electron goes passed on to the next

445
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:56,760
member of the cytochrome chain at the end of that chain is a molecule called cytochrome oxidase

446
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:01,400
it looks very similar to hemoglobin it has a pocket that oxygen can bind to

447
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:08,440
and the oxygen binds in that pocket of the cytochrome oxidase the electrons come streaming down and

448
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:16,920
when four reach it it turns the oxygen into water it reduces the oxygen to water and so

449
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:22,440
as you have oxygen there it pulls the electrons through and as it pulls the electrons through

450
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:27,480
the hydrogen is pumped out what good is that well because you have now a big difference between

451
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:33,960
the amount of hydrogen in the intermembrane space and almost none in the matrix that hydrogen

452
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:41,400
creates a concentration gradient and it comes pouring in through this very specialized pour

453
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:49,400
which is an ATP synthase and as it comes down the energy in that gradient is used to make ATP

454
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:58,520
from ADP and that's magic this is in reality each mitochondrion acts as a hydrogen fuel cell

455
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:03,880
if you're familiar with hydrogen batteries and you know how much energy you can get out of it

456
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:09,960
you can run a tesla from hydrogen batteries essentially right so this is the same idea

457
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:16,920
that is hydrogen is separated into electrons that flow through the electric circuit

458
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:24,120
and then the protons are used to or the electrons as they flow through are you are drawn away

459
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:30,120
by the oxygen to make water and you have your fuel cell your battery your hydrogen battery

460
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:41,400
okay so what's the advantage suppose you just burn sugar in the case of without oxygen so no

461
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:49,000
oxygen this is just sugar being used to make some energy you get two ATP for an amount of sugar

462
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:57,320
say and if you're a bacterium or a penicillin mold or something like that you could do just

463
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:05,160
about what a mold can do not much although they do a good job on that bread lactic acid is the

464
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:11,480
endpoint and this is you know if you exercise strongly you get into an oxygen debt and you

465
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:18,440
build up lactic acid well you know that that you can't keep running you need to stop and get oxygen

466
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:28,040
to replace the energy the burning the sugar with oxygen gives you almost 20 times as much

467
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:36,280
ATP as you get from running it without oxygen it's a huge energy advantage 20 times the amount of

468
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:45,240
energy and this allows the cell to do a lot more than a prokaryote can do without the oxygen burning

469
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:51,960
ability i have that little marshmallow in there just to remind me to give you an example of the

470
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:57,000
amount of energy and sugar when you burn it if you've you've you've burned your marshmallows over

471
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:02,040
your campfires it catches fire and it burns pretty well there's a lot of energy and sugar when you

472
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:08,760
burn it with a with oxygen of course the cell takes it in small pieces and turns that into ATP rather

473
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:18,120
than let it burn like that and nature takes the mitochondria and it puts it where it needs to be

474
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:24,920
inside the cell this is another example of of how a the different cells

475
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:32,360
evolve their different structures in order to do the function that they're required and provide

476
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:38,120
the energy to do that function so this is a mitochondrion that sits inside a muscle cell

477
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:45,720
those striations and top and bottom are the are the muscle fibers that are going to use the energy

478
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:51,880
produced by the mitochondrion and each mitochondrion essentially produces the same pretty much the

479
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:58,360
same amount of energy it has about the same components so you if you look at the volume of

480
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:04,280
mitochondria you can get a pretty good idea of the ability of the cell to generate you know how

481
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:12,440
much energy you can generate and i have a couple of examples here that i think are pretty impressive

482
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:21,080
on the left you have a muscle from a mako shark and it's these are muscle fibers that are cut in

483
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:26,200
cross-section they're going in and out of the board and right next to each one of them are these

484
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:33,960
mitochondria so these are mitochondria these the muscle cell this is the mitochondria very close

485
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:40,600
and a lot of volume so you have essentially looks like pretty much the similar amount of volume in

486
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:45,800
mitochondria producing the energy as you have in the muscle cells that are producing the work

487
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:52,760
this might be similar to thinking about an electric car that has half the weight of it is batteries

488
00:47:54,280 --> 00:48:00,760
in order to do what it has to do the other and so this is a shark muscle so it's a cartilaginous fish

489
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:07,720
but on the other side we have a mammalian tissue it's a heart muscle cardiac muscle

490
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:14,280
happens to be from a mouse but it's pretty much similar here these are the the lines of the muscle

491
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:19,480
so those are the ones that are pulling apart and going together and these are all mitochondria

492
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:26,520
sit in the middle of these fibers of the heart this is the nucleus of the heart muscle here's

493
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:33,240
a pile of mitochondria cardiac muscle about 40 percent of the volume is mitochondria that's about

494
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:38,120
and there's a maybe half of it or a little more maybe is the is the striated muscle

495
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:45,640
but the ratio is is pretty pretty good in brain tissue for example that ratio is about 10 percent

496
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:51,560
of that volume is mitochondrial so it shows you the difference in the energy requirements

497
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:58,600
brain versus heart now this is probably my my favorite one this is a hummingbird flight muscle

498
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:06,920
hummingbird that beats 300 times a second and can stop and hover in the air and these uh this is

499
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:13,640
really impressive these are capillaries and here's the mitochondria between the capillaries

500
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:19,080
is a nucleus of a cell and there's the muscle cells here you have more mitochondria than you have

501
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:25,560
muscle that makes sense if you think about it right and here's a close-up on the capillary

502
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:32,280
it's a cell in the middle of that capillary and it's filled surrounded by mitochondria

503
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:39,160
here's what's using oxygen what's producing the ATP here's the muscle thin strand of muscle

504
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:48,040
completely surrounded by uh mitochondria so it's it's pretty impressive and you can understand how

505
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:54,200
the hummingbird can accomplish what it does how the shark can accomplish what it was how the heart

506
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:58,840
can accomplish what it has to do for for that length of time that you that you needed to work

507
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:05,960
all right so let's go move on a little bit now and talk about the multicellular organisms

508
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:10,520
in a way it's a little backward but what I did is I showed you what the capabilities

509
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:16,840
of the system is once you can provide the energy and here's how it impacts things like

510
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:24,680
uh uh uh evolution if you're an organism and you're working at the substrate level

511
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:31,160
that's making lactate say without having the advantage of making oxygen your energy providing

512
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:41,400
system is uh only about 10 efficient it's not much 10 that means if you had a predator come along

513
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:48,360
and want to take advantage of the energy that you have and it grabs you and it's 10 efficient now

514
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:56,360
it becomes 1 percent 10 percent of 10 percent is 1 percent and that's not a that's not a good deal

515
00:50:56,360 --> 00:51:01,240
it costs more to do the engulfing and the digesting than you get out of it so there's

516
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:08,360
very little predation at the level of single cell organisms that are prokaryotic but with

517
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:14,600
oxidative phosphorylation that allows you to use oxygen to generate energy you're around 40 percent

518
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:21,160
efficient now the first person in the chain gets grabbed by the next person it's 40 percent of 40

519
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:26,840
percent and then 40 percent 40 percent 40 percent and you could develop a chain at least six

520
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:36,760
layers deep before you run below one percent of the energy supply left that means that predators

521
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:44,680
now have an advantage can gain an advantage in their competition with other organisms and

522
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:53,160
the bigger the cell then the better the predator so predation tends to produce larger and larger

523
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:59,560
cells or organisms and prey doesn't sit around waiting to be preyed on it does the same

524
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:09,400
strategy and starts getting bigger for protection so when once you have this efficiency in the chain

525
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:17,880
then you have the ability to really stimulate growth and diversity and development

526
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:25,000
so why didn't bacteria get larger they had two billion years before the event that made

527
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:31,880
mitochondria and that's because the way prokaryotes work their energy producing system

528
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:36,360
those that prokaryot bacterial cell that went to become the mitochondria

529
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:41,960
was still making energy based upon its own surface area and if it got bigger its energy

530
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:47,080
requirements would grow with the volume by the cube but its ability to make energy would only grow

531
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:52,840
by the square root of the surface area that's not a good strategy but once you put the

532
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:59,720
mitochondria inside the cell you can add mitochondria you really could add them and then

533
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:05,480
your energy production capacity will grow with the volume of the cell but your utilization for

534
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:12,600
most cells can be or is related to the surface area that's a much more favorable relationship

535
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:19,960
so bacteria we're not going to be able to get anywhere with a 10 percent energy efficiency

536
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:26,600
and they couldn't grow larger anyway because of surface volume considerations

537
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:35,240
and bacteria are very successful in their niche but it's a simple solution and it's not going to

538
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:41,960
get complex they work very well and the successful bacteria are the ones that can divide fastest

539
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:48,280
and that means you can't have a lot of genes because that takes time to reproduce your genes

540
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:54,280
so the smaller the number of genes you have the faster you can reproduce and the more successful

541
00:53:54,280 --> 00:54:03,560
you are so the prokaryote philosophy the prokaryote strategy keeps the cells simple and small

542
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:09,720
and successful but simple and small until you've got mitochondria you can't get complexity

543
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:16,840
now let's look at the more modern part of the oxygen curve in the last minute or so

544
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:24,040
and this represents oxygen variations that we know closer to our own time

545
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:29,640
this is half a half a billion years this is from essentially the Cambrian explosion of life

546
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:35,800
on to present day and if you plot in the yellow curve there oxygen levels you see it's not constant

547
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:43,880
it varies up and down and what we now know from this up and down is that the rates of evolutionary

548
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:51,240
diversity and the die off in the extinctions are related in a great measure to the oxygen

549
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:58,440
history so that at times when oxygen is rising you have increase in diversity taking advantage of

550
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:04,520
the everything that oxygen can give you in terms of energy from the mitochondria but when oxygen

551
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:11,160
becomes limiting then the inefficient forms die off there's one particular there's a lot of information

552
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:16,920
here but i want to focus on this one here this peak this is when oxygen reached about 35 percent

553
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:24,120
in the atmosphere remember today it's 21 percent there was 35 percent that's as much it's a maximum

554
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:30,040
because any more than that and the the forest would burn and you wouldn't be producing more oxygen

555
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:35,560
so there's a limit and that's it right oh okay so

556
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:45,160
at that time you had a higher density in the atmosphere because that was all extra oxygen

557
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:53,320
and you allowed the gigantic insects and flying insects and that the only thing i had left to try

558
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:59,000
to get through is just to give you some idea of what the human body does and we produce about 85

559
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:08,840
watts of energy about a good strong light bulb and we use about the 150 balloons worth of air

560
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:16,280
per day and we produce a half liter of water from metabolism every day and the mitochondria in our

561
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:25,000
body make essentially a hundred pounds of ATP every day by cycling ADP that's about half the

562
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:32,200
body's weight of ATP cycling and that's that's the strength of the mitochondria and with that i will

563
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:36,920
let's just summarize what we said and i'll say thanks and ask for final questions

564
