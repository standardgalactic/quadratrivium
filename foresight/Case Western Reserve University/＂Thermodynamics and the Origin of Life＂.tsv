0	5520	Case Western Reserve University's Institute for the Science of Origins proudly presents
5520	8320	the Origins Science Scholars Program.
8320	13360	The Institute advances the scientific understanding and application of origins and evolution of
13360	15360	human and natural systems.
15360	19160	The Origins Science Scholars Lectures are presented with the assistance of Case Western
19160	24360	Reserve University's Segal Lifelong Learning Program, College of Arts and Sciences, and
24360	25360	Media Vision.
26000	32320	Tonight, it's my pleasure to introduce Professor Michael Hincheski, who is the Warren E. Rupp
32320	37680	Assistant Professor in the Department of Physics here at Case Western Reserve University.
37680	42800	As Dr. Hincheski writes, random fluctuations pervade cellular biology from the level of
42800	49200	individual biochemical reactions to the intricate machinery responsible for transport and signaling.
49200	55680	And yet, despite the noise at all scales, collective order emerges, a bewildering hierarchy
55680	60440	of interconnected processes carefully arranged throughout the volume of the cell.
60440	65920	Tonight, he will tell us where that order might come from as he talks about thermodynamics
65920	67600	and the origin of life.
67600	71760	Please join me in welcoming him.
71760	76760	What I want to talk today, in some ways, the entire topic of the talk, is a field of physics
76800	81520	which maybe a lot of people have not heard of because it's not quite always in the news.
81520	83520	It's known as non-equilibrium thermodynamics.
83520	88400	It has kind of an unwieldy name, but the questions it asks are, in some ways, some of the most
88400	91920	fundamental questions we can ask about nature.
91920	97720	So in particular, one of the central aspects of it is that physical systems tend to disorder.
97720	102200	This is the thing, the famous concept of entropy, which is famous, in particular, for being
102200	107400	extremely confusing, not just to non-physicists, but to physicists themselves.
107400	111000	And so what I'm going to try to do in this talk, in some ways, the central theme of it,
111000	115100	is to hopefully make that concept a little bit less confusing, or if that fails, at least
115100	119280	confuse you in a way you haven't been confused before.
119280	125800	So I study biological things, so biological things are not entirely disordered.
125800	130920	So one of the fascinating aspects of this topic is also, despite the fact this tendency
131440	133680	toward disorder, why does complexity arise?
133680	140600	And this leads into very interesting questions, people debate whether how the second law influences
140600	142280	the origin of life.
142280	148720	So we're going to try to kind of disentangle some of the confusion in that area.
148720	151800	And most importantly, as you'll see, this is what I'm going to do with the themes of
151800	154840	the later part of the talk, at what cost.
154840	159160	So we're going to show, and of course this is obvious because we exist, that indeed complexity
159160	165520	does exist in nature, but it comes at an inherent cost, a thermodynamic cost, which
165520	168120	will explicate.
168120	174560	And kind of putting all these ideas together, what can they tell us about how life arose?
174560	179120	Can they actually give us some clues as to the fundamental mechanisms four billion years
179120	182920	ago where these living things first arose?
182920	187480	Now these are all kind of extremely weighty questions, very complex systems and topics,
187880	191920	and we're going to start somewhere seemingly completely ridiculously simple.
191920	194880	But I think it's a nice illustration of some of the basic ideas.
194880	196880	We're going to play a game.
196880	200720	This game is called Billiards on a Bunimovic stadium.
200720	205680	This is a shape shown here on the left that's named after Russian mathematician, and hence
205680	208560	it kind of looks like a hockey stadium.
208560	210360	And the game is going to be simple.
210360	212360	We're going to start with one particle initially.
212360	215520	And what I'm going to do is you're going to pay attention to the kind of position space.
215520	219800	The particle is going to basically move in that position space, bounce off the walls,
219800	221160	and it never loses velocity.
221160	222920	The energy is always constant.
222920	227440	And we're going to keep track of its position here on the left, or on your left also, and
227440	229400	the direction here on the right.
229400	233400	So let's show what a one particle looks like, and you can see just bouncing off, and every
233400	236760	time it bounces, the direction changes.
236760	241400	Now we're going to play now this same game, but we're going to make 200 copies of that
241400	242880	particle.
242880	246480	Now these particles don't bounce off of each other, they don't interact, we're basically
246480	251960	making 200 copies and all superimposing them on the same graph, and we're just going to
251960	254160	watch how they behave.
254160	257240	And the main difference is we're going to put all the particles initially at the same
257240	262200	spot shown here, but we're going to make their directions ever so slightly different, maybe
262200	268800	plus or minus a degree here, and then we're going to watch how the system evolves in time.
268800	271860	So you can see the particles start kind of as a compact group, but every time they hit
271860	277060	a curved surface, the groups begin to spread apart, and this continues, and we're going
277060	279460	to watch this for a few minutes.
279460	283020	And what you can notice here, this is actually one of the most famous effects in dynamical
283020	285140	systems, known as the butterfly effect.
285140	289180	You may have heard this from who talks about chaos theory, where if you have this complex
289180	293420	system, and this doesn't seem particularly complex, but it's complex enough, and you
293420	300020	start it with slightly different initial conditions, and you watch it later on in time, those trajectories
300020	301900	will eventually diverge quite dramatically.
301900	306460	And the famous example of this is a butterfly flapping its wings in Hong Kong might end
306460	312500	up weeks later with a hurricane off the coast of Florida, whereas if it didn't flap its
312500	313700	wings, that wouldn't have happened.
313700	317420	That's kind of the popular science version of this, but in general, it just means this
317420	320340	kind of very sensitive dependence on initial conditions.
320340	324420	And what you can see here is from that initial point where all the particles were in the
324420	328980	same spot with more or less the same direction, in other words, kind of an ordered system
328980	334100	and we'll define that a little bit more quantitatively later on, we go to a situation where all
334100	341060	the particles are now spread almost uniformly throughout the entire volume of the stadium
341060	347220	and almost all possible directions are uniformly exhibited.
347220	351140	So this is going to be crucial, but we want to kind of somehow quantify this, put this
351140	353020	into, give it a number.
353020	357340	So this is kind of going from an ordered to a disordered way, can we actually translate
357340	360420	that into like a quantity.
360420	363860	So to do that, we're going to add one more element to our game.
363860	366780	We're going to create basically a grid of addresses.
366780	372580	Think of this almost like regions on a map, you have demarcating longitude and latitude,
372580	377820	but here we're going to have some addresses denoting position on the left and some addresses
377820	380740	denoting direction on the right.
380740	383660	Now here I've just divided everything into six sections for simplicity.
383660	386740	I could do this into a million sections.
386780	393420	The same concept still applies and at each time, while we're looking at the system, we
393420	395660	can be at a particular, or the system is going to be a particular address.
395660	401580	So for example here, the system at the initial time is in address 1D, because it's in region
401580	408540	1 direction region D and at some later time it's going to be in some address which we'll
408540	414580	call xy, but there's always going to be some address in which the system is at all times
414620	419740	and in order to basically quantify this a little bit better, we're going to now, we're
419740	423740	considering this ensemble, this 200 copies of the system, so we're going to basically
423740	429300	define the fractions of that ensemble that are in particular addresses at particular
429300	430300	times.
430300	435180	So we're going to say the probability to be at a certain address xy at time t is basically
435180	438740	going to be the fraction of all those systems at that address.
438740	444380	Now this is going somewhere, it's not just mathematics for mathematics sake, because
444380	449260	once we have that probability, we're going to, this is the final step, we're going to
449260	451340	use it to calculate a number, right?
451340	453980	And that's, so I'm going to show, there's going to be a few equations in the talk,
453980	458740	I apologize, understanding it hopefully won't be based on, you know, you don't need to follow
458740	462380	the equations too deeply, but this equation I really wanted to show because in some ways
462380	465780	I'm going to argue it's one of the most beautiful equations in physics.
465780	469660	And so what we've done here is we've taken that probability, we've summed, we've multiplied
469660	473540	it by the logarithm of itself and summed over all the addresses.
473540	477100	We multiply it by some unimportant constant out in front and that's the thing we call
477100	480940	entropy, this mystical, important quantity in physics, that's it, that's all it is.
480940	486140	It's just this looking at a system, dividing it up into addresses, calculating probabilities,
486140	487300	getting a number out of it.
487300	491660	And what we'll show later is that as a concept this is incredibly versatile because these
491660	496380	addresses here are position and direction addresses, but they could be anything, in
496380	500020	fact they could be chemical states and we'll show examples of that later.
500020	505340	The originator of this equation, the first one to write it down is J.W. Gibbs.
505340	511220	He was, someone called Einstein called him the greatest mind in American history.
511220	518540	That might be, I'm not qualified to say that directly, he definitely arguably is among
518540	522180	the or the greatest physicists in American history.
522180	525860	Part of the beauty of this, of his work on thermodynamics in general in this equation
525860	528980	in particular is it has such a long afterlife.
528980	534580	So 50 years roughly after he wrote it down, Claude Shannon came across the same equation
534580	538540	in information theory and more or less laid the foundations of our modern understanding
538540	542180	of how information is processed in computer systems.
542180	548780	So this is an equation with an extremely many, many different applications, but for us it's
548780	553420	a number, a positive number and it's going to have a very simple kind of interpretation.
553420	558940	So if all of our system is in one position on the map, so one region on the map, our
559060	562140	entropy is zero.
562140	568980	As the ensemble kind of covers more and more different regions, so we're going to color
568980	574340	those with different shadings of orange, entropy grows.
574340	578300	So initially entropy was zero, here now it's spread out a little bit, so entropy has grown
578300	585060	to about 1.9 in this unit of K, here it's now almost uniformly spread throughout both
585060	588340	in position and direction space, it's reached about 3.4.
588380	592540	So think of it as just a measure of how much this probability spreads out.
592540	597660	And we're going to now watch that same movie that we saw before, that ensemble kind of
597660	601300	diverging because of this butterfly effect, but we're now going to keep track of that
601300	603780	number as we're watching that.
603780	604980	So this is what it looks like.
604980	609300	So it's diverging initially, probability is more or less confined in a few regions, our
609300	615380	entropy is small and then as time progresses entropy increases.
615420	619780	Now it's a bit noisy here because we only did 200 copies, so if we had done this like
619780	624980	a million times, a million copies we'd actually see a smooth increasing curve and as it increases
624980	630420	it begins to kind of saturate and almost reach a maximum, and that maximum is also going
630420	634180	to be important because that maximum essentially is the place where the probability is more
634180	638780	or less uniformly distributed both in position and direction space.
638780	643940	So I'm not going to wait until it completely reaches it, but this is what it looks like
643940	646260	after you run it for a long time.
646260	650340	And that maximum is then the second, like three equations in the talk, this is the second
650340	651340	equation.
651340	656620	Again, one of the most fundamental equations in physics, which is that maximum of entropy
656620	663060	that it reaches is just K times the log of W, and W all it is is just a number of addresses
663060	664060	in our map.
664060	669860	So we had six position addresses, six direction addresses, so altogether 36 combinations, so
669860	673620	it's just a log of 36, which is about 3.4.
673620	674620	That's it.
674620	679940	Now this equation is so important that Boltzmann or rather Boltzmann's probably immediate family
679940	683380	or supporters had it carved into his gravestone.
683380	690260	So it is literally a physics equation carved in stone, and it's probably the most famous
690260	695820	version of entropy that people are familiar with, but keep in mind that it only applies
695820	697740	at really long times, right?
697740	702940	Once the system has basically uniformly distributed itself around all of position and direction
702940	704460	space, and that's what we call equilibrium.
704460	708620	But what I'm going to argue throughout the rest of the talk is somehow this initial part
708620	713740	where entropy is rising is also incredibly important, and in some sense the Gibbs version,
713740	719900	which gives us the entropy throughout, is the more fundamental thing to look at.
719900	726780	So at this stage, we can kind of summarize what this little game has shown us by making
726780	727780	a law, right?
727780	732220	So this is our version of the second law of thermodynamics, which says that for an isolated
732220	736020	system, so a system that does not interact with the environment, like our little Bunimovic
736020	742540	stadium, billiards game, entropy increases over time until it reaches this maximum, given
742540	744940	by the Boltzmann equation, all right?
744940	745940	And it's a law, right?
745940	749540	So you should definitely, definitely believe it, you know.
749540	752220	And this is how I as an undergraduate always took it.
752220	757300	People brought me laws, especially if they're literally carved in stone, right?
757300	758980	You just, you know, you take it as a given.
758980	760940	This is a law of nature.
760940	763640	So is this, in fact, universally true?
763640	767100	So I'm going to show you next, we'll perhaps shock you.
767100	771100	I will violate the second law of thermodynamics right in front of your eyes.
771100	776340	And I'm going to do this by just a very, very small change to our game, right?
776340	779980	We had our Russian hockey stadium with curved edges.
779980	781620	I'm going to make them straight, all right?
781620	784220	So I'm going to look at tennis court.
784220	786180	And let's see what happens.
786180	789940	So here's the same game played in a rectangle, all right?
789940	793940	Now, you can see the group of trajectories here, which started with slightly different
793940	798780	initial conditions, is kind of spreading out, but definitely not as much as before.
798780	802060	And in particular, look at direction space on the right.
802060	803900	Direction space, you see that it's not spreading out at all.
803900	808580	It's only really visiting four corners of that direction graph.
808580	811740	Our entropy is increasing a little bit, but not so much.
811740	815740	And in fact, if you run this forever, it will never, ever reach the Boltzmann equation.
815740	819820	So that thing carved in stone is clearly not universally true.
819820	824380	If you keep on running this a long time, it's going to kind of look like a 1980s screensaver.
824380	825940	It's kind of mesmerizing.
825940	830140	But it's surely not this kind of spreading out in all of position space that we saw before,
830140	832260	where it almost looked like a gas, right?
832260	833940	Spreading out through a volume.
833940	835460	Here it's much more ordered, right?
835460	840580	And that's clearly reflected by the fact that our entropy is much smaller, all right?
840580	844540	So I think we're going to need a revision on our law.
844540	847780	Terms and conditions may apply.
847780	854700	And in fact, this is actually a subtle and difficult problem because this is, well, from
854700	859860	the mathematician standpoint, this is enough to show that clearly this is not a universal
859860	865420	law, but can it be shown for any systems?
865420	871220	So it turns out that the only place where this law has been rigorously proven is for
871220	875020	these kind of simple mathematical games like billiards.
875020	880700	And Yakov Sinai, who was the first person to actually prove this for a billiards system,
880700	885540	actually won what's the equivalent of a Nobel Prize in math, the 2014 Abel Prize for this
885540	886540	proof.
886540	887540	It's ridiculously hard.
887540	889860	And that's for one particle bouncing around.
889860	891540	It becomes even more difficult.
891660	896140	Like, it's not even proven for a group of balls bouncing off of each other in a simple
896140	898100	two-dimensional surface.
898100	899500	So it's quite a difficult thing.
899500	901980	What do you mean by an isolated system?
901980	906060	So in this particular case, I mean a system that doesn't exchange energy or particles
906060	907820	with its surroundings, right?
907820	911060	So this is, I mean, later on we'll consider systems like biological systems where we're
911060	914060	clearly sitting here, you know, this room is a certain temperature.
914060	919860	We're constantly exchanging energy particles in the gas around us or bouncing off of us,
919860	921780	passing us and taking energy away from us.
921780	923820	So that's a more complicated scenario.
923820	928820	So in this particular case, I mean a system that has no exchange of energy or particles
928820	930980	or anything else with its surroundings.
930980	935380	For both of those shapes, does the size of the shape matter?
935380	943220	In other words, if the stadium was round or if it was higher and wider or in the square,
943220	946300	if it was higher and wider, does that have anything to do with it?
946300	952220	The absolute size of the shape doesn't matter except that circles are a bit different.
952220	957780	So it does have to have this combination of straight and curved edges, but the actual dimensions
957780	959380	of the shape don't matter too much.
959380	964260	It'll matter in terms of how long it may take to equilibrate, but beyond that, the second
964260	967060	law will hold for the curved stadium, yeah.
967060	970380	Be, you know, again in the shape of the arena.
970380	975820	For example, when you have a curved one and you've got objects ricocheting off of a curve,
975820	981460	they have, you know, a bigger range of direction they can travel in when you hit a straight
981460	983580	line or a flat surface.
983580	987460	The angle of incidence equals the angle of deflection, yeah.
987460	991780	So that's actually, you bring up a very interesting point because it turns out that in this particular
991780	995940	shape, the way the dynamics are designed, the angle of incidence always does equal the
995940	1000380	angle of reflection, but you have to define the angle as kind of the tangent to the circle
1000380	1003980	when you're doing the, when you're doing the kind of curved circular part.
1003980	1008180	So it's basically the line that just touches, that just grazes the edge of the circle.
1008180	1010300	And then it bounces off of that line.
1010300	1014580	But what you bring up, which is actually is true, is that the behavior off curved surfaces
1014580	1016980	is much different than the behavior of straight lines.
1016980	1020060	And that's why in the rectangular case, you get much less divergence.
1020060	1026260	So a little extra kind of, you know, the slight mathematical difference there is enough to
1026260	1028180	create this divergence.
1028180	1030860	But it's actually a really, it's a really subtle point, and it's not something that
1030860	1034180	like you can, well, I'm gonna actually, I'm gonna say you can't generalize it, but I'm
1034180	1040380	gonna literally just do that in the next slide, but it's very difficult to prove rigorously.
1040380	1043620	And that's why it's kind of, you know, I mean, Yakov Sinai was one of these mathematicians
1043620	1047260	who sat in the back of physics lectures and looked at what the physicists were saying
1047260	1049100	and thought, like, this is just ridiculous.
1049100	1050100	They're making so many assumptions.
1050100	1053820	Let me go back to first principles and prove it, and then it took them like a career to
1053820	1055660	prove one simple thing.
1055660	1060460	What if the arena were shaped, say, like a hexagon or a pentagon?
1060540	1064340	I think from, I have to double check this.
1064340	1068780	I believe that any combination of straight edges would not give you chaos, but I would
1068780	1069780	have to double check that.
1069780	1075500	I haven't seen this game played in like polygons, but I think you do need to have these curved
1075500	1078300	surfaces for this to work.
1078300	1079820	Thank you for joining us.
1079820	1086220	You've been watching Professor Mike Hynchefsky introducing the basic concepts of non-equilibrium
1086220	1087540	thermodynamics.
1087540	1092100	For more information on the Origins Science Scholars Program, please visit the institute's
1092100	1097220	website at origins.case.edu.
1097220	1103020	In the next part of the talk, Professor Hynchefsky will discuss entropy and the chemistry underlying
1103020	1104020	life.
1104020	1106580	Now, back to the talk.
1106580	1109580	There is clearly something called the second law of thermodynamics, which we learn about
1109580	1117420	in textbooks and which does exist, but in some ways it's kind of a leap of faith, right?
1118300	1121420	What I want to kind of emphasize is, yes, we look at these shapes of the surfaces, but
1121420	1125420	what really was the distinguished thing was one led to this kind of chaotic dynamics which
1125420	1129580	was highly dependent on initial conditions, the other didn't.
1129580	1135140	We believe, again, this very, very rough rule of thumb that complicated systems, meaning
1135140	1139820	systems with lots and lots of particles like all of us and the universe around us, with
1139820	1144020	strong interactions where particles bouncing off, interacting with each other through fundamental
1144060	1149540	physical forces, that system taking an aggregate is indeed a chaotic system.
1149540	1152980	And we, of course, we know that for things like weather systems, we see chaos all the
1152980	1153980	time.
1153980	1159140	And in particular, we think the entire universe, observable universe, falls in this category.
1159140	1164540	And this is why we can talk about, at least as a kind of leap of faith, a second law for
1164540	1168340	the universe, even though we can't rigorously mathematically prove it.
1168340	1172020	Now one thing I wanted to do is an aside, and this is, again, I apologize to actual
1172020	1173740	cosmologists in the audience.
1173740	1176460	People love to talk about the entropy of the universe.
1176460	1179060	What actually is it and what does it look like?
1179060	1184420	So this is the best estimate that I could find, but it's going to, it looks like that.
1184420	1188740	This is based on a paper from Egan and Lineweaver published a few years ago, and I wanted to
1188740	1192140	convince you, it's a little bit different than our line, you know, entropy increasing
1192140	1198460	over time in the stadium, but still same pattern, things increase over time.
1198460	1200460	So this is, the time scale is a little bit different.
1200460	1204980	You can notice this is like 10 to the minus 40, 10 to the minus 21, 10 to the 20.
1204980	1208820	We're about 10 to the 17 seconds since the Big Bang.
1208820	1213660	But overall, that entropy has increased by fairly large, you know, it kind of stays constant
1213660	1218020	for a while and then has these huge increases over time, and we're right about here kind
1218020	1222940	of on this final plateau before an extrapolated value where eventually the universe will end
1222940	1225860	up in heat death and perfect equilibrium, right?
1225860	1227740	That's the maximum over there.
1227740	1228740	We're not there yet.
1228740	1231540	We still have time to go, happily.
1231540	1234740	Now what's really interesting about, I'm not going to talk about all the, what causes
1234740	1238220	all these individual bumps, just kind of an aside, what's really interesting is if you
1238220	1244740	have to guess what contributes the most to the entropy of the universe in the current
1244740	1247380	moment, it's actually quite interesting.
1247380	1248380	So here's our entropy.
1248380	1253340	So 10 to the 104 in these units of K, and these are the contributions.
1253340	1255660	So supermassive black holes.
1255660	1266380	So these are the black holes that can be billions of times the mass of our sun, 99.999% a lot.
1266380	1267620	What else contributes to the entropy?
1267620	1269420	Oh, there's also smaller black holes.
1269420	1273260	Those are in there about .0001%.
1273260	1277900	And there's a bunch of other things, photons, you've got to add a bunch of zeros.
1277900	1281420	And then there's a whole list in this paper, and eventually you'll get down to ordinary
1281420	1286220	matter, including all of us in the audience here, and the rest of the stars and other
1286220	1287220	matter in the universe.
1287220	1290860	And that's our fraction of the total entropy.
1290860	1295460	In a weird way, and again, something that's not the topic of this course, black holes
1295460	1300460	dominate the entropy budget of the universe to a ridiculous extent.
1300460	1305300	In fact, that recent black hole that you all saw in the news, that famous, the black hole
1305300	1308540	picture, that's about 10 to the 95 K in entropy.
1308540	1315700	If you, based on its extrapolated parameters, that has 100 trillion times more entropy.
1315700	1320860	In other words, 100 trillion times more addresses living on the surface of that black hole than
1320860	1325100	all the ordinary of the matter in the universe put together.
1325100	1330140	So one way of looking at the issue of complexity in terms of the entropy, this second law says
1330140	1336700	the entropy of the universe must always increase, is in some sense, all of us here are highly,
1336860	1341100	highly irrelevant to the overall entropy budget of the universe.
1341100	1342100	That cannot be said enough.
1342100	1347460	I mean, in some sense, the fact that you have these stars burning for a few billion years,
1347460	1352140	and you have some rocky planets circling those stars, and some chemical processes happening
1352140	1358420	on those planets that lead to some kind of self-aware life, I mean, that's kind of like
1358420	1365540	froth on a giant ocean, where the vast majority, the bulk of that ocean is living on the surface
1365580	1367500	of black holes.
1367500	1372380	So in some sense, what's happening with black holes dominates the entropy budget, and everything
1372380	1376300	else is kind of like, you know, you can't even call it a rounding error, because this
1376300	1379300	is like such a tiny, tiny fraction of it.
1379300	1382140	Now, that's not quite the end of the story, right?
1382140	1385900	Because in that sense, then we could say, well, anything goes, because, you know, at
1385900	1389740	some level, like, the fact that we have, we lower our entropy state a little bit here,
1389740	1393300	it doesn't really matter that much in terms of the universal entropy budget, but it's
1393300	1394620	not quite that, right?
1394620	1398660	Because in some sense, the second law doesn't just apply to the universe as a whole, it
1398660	1403500	also applies to subsystems of the universe, and that's where we pay kind of the dues
1403500	1406060	to the second law in everything that we do.
1406060	1409820	All right, so how does the second law play out on smaller scale?
1409820	1413620	So that was the end of our cosmology aside.
1413620	1418060	To understand this kind of, you know, its implications on our scale, let's take a look
1418060	1419060	at some snapshots.
1419060	1422620	So we're going to go back to our game, and now we're going to look at, let's say the
1422620	1423620	first 20 seconds, okay?
1423620	1427260	So we're going to look at that movie again, first 20 seconds of it, while the entropy
1427260	1430380	is increasing, let's watch, all right?
1430380	1435460	So the thing kind of diverges, and then the movie will stop, all right?
1435460	1439500	I'm going to show you a second version of that, and you can just shout out what you
1439500	1440500	think is going on.
1440500	1447340	So this is the second version of that.
1447340	1448340	It's converging.
1448340	1449340	What have I done?
1449340	1451180	I'm playing, okay, yes.
1451180	1453300	Obviously, it seems like I'm playing backwards.
1453300	1455420	The answer is no.
1455420	1458460	I'm almost doing that, and in fact, I'm getting the same result.
1458460	1462860	What I've actually done is I've started in this configuration here, that was the configuration
1462860	1466620	at 20 seconds, and all I've done is I've reversed all the velocities.
1466620	1470540	So I basically, these were the old velocities here in pink, I've now just moved them across
1470540	1475660	the other side of the circle, and just, you know, rearranged all the directions.
1475660	1479940	And when you do that, everything just converges back to the beginning.
1479940	1481940	It seems like it's going backwards in time, right?
1481940	1487420	To us, psychologically, that's what seems to be happening, and in fact, this is actually
1487420	1490940	true that for any physical system, you can actually reverse things, right?
1490940	1493900	So people have actually just a few days ago that was in the news that people have managed
1493900	1495380	to do this for several qubits.
1495380	1498820	They more or less were able to have qubits evolve in time for a certain amount of time,
1498820	1504580	do some complicated quantum mechanical manipulations, and those qubits, those little quantum particles,
1504580	1509020	would then evolve backwards, kind of, they called them Benjamin Button, you know, qubits.
1509020	1512860	Now, why did you think it was going backwards in time?
1512860	1517180	Because to us, you know, our experience of the world, we know that there's a certain
1517180	1520020	sequence of things that are more likely to happen versus the other.
1520020	1524500	For example, we know that little babies grow up to be teenagers, grow up to be middle-aged
1524500	1528380	people, grow up to eventually, you know, be older, and then eventually we die.
1528380	1529700	That's, we see that all the time.
1529700	1534740	We rarely see except in movies with Brad Pitt, you know, old people becoming infants,
1534740	1536100	you know, and reverting back.
1536100	1541220	Now it turns out that there's nothing inherently violating the laws of physics of having a
1541220	1542740	Benjamin Button.
1542740	1545100	It's just highly, highly unlikely.
1545100	1549060	And this is one of the things that we, that kind of a consequence that we're going to
1549060	1553820	try to emphasize about entropy increasing is that it means when entropy is increasing,
1553820	1557020	certain sequences of events are much more likely to happen than others.
1557020	1561060	So for example, that sequence when the, when the balls kind of diverge and bounce and become
1561060	1565380	more disordered, that seems much more likely to you to occur than a sequence where everything
1565380	1566380	converges.
1566380	1570300	Even though it's possible to have all those velocities flipped and everything to go back
1570300	1573700	to its initial part, it's just really, really hard to do that.
1573700	1577780	And the more particles you have, the more statistically difficult it is to flip everything
1577780	1580460	and have everything converge back to itself, right?
1580460	1585220	So when entropy increases, there seems to be a preferred order of things, right?
1585220	1588300	And we'll make that a quantitative in a little bit.
1588300	1592760	Now I want to show you now just a contrast, a second snapshot, which is at the very end
1592760	1596200	of the simulation when we're looking near equilibrium, all right?
1596200	1598000	So this is going to be, I'm going to do the same game.
1598000	1602200	So I'm going to play it for 20 seconds like that.
1602200	1605520	And then, okay, it's bouncing around like a gas.
1605520	1608840	I'm going to do the same thing, flip all the velocities, play it again.
1608840	1612440	And there, if you look at it, you won't be able to tell which one, if I just showed you
1612440	1616240	without telling you the difference, there's no way you can actually even tell statistically
1616240	1618400	which one is going forwards, which one is going backwards.
1618400	1622680	In fact, every sequence of events, when we've reached our maximum, when entropy no longer
1622720	1625640	changes, is equally likely as any other.
1625640	1627000	There's no preferred direction.
1627000	1631320	So in a very real sense, in equilibrium, there is no arrow of time, right?
1631320	1638200	This is the famous, if you may have heard of it in discussions of this topic, but this
1638200	1639560	is what it boils down to, right?
1639560	1643520	We don't see that arrow of time in an equilibrium system when entropy is not increasing.
1643520	1645560	Okay, so let's make this a little quantitative.
1645560	1648200	So this is kind of, I'm going to give you a little bit of flavor of some of the ways we
1648200	1651960	think about entropy now, kind of a modern physics context.
1651960	1654880	We can actually do this, play this game in terms of addresses.
1654880	1659760	So we have one take, which is, we have a system that visits, you know, four addresses as
1659760	1660960	it's evolving in time.
1660960	1665480	We can ask, take two, the system visits those same addresses, but in reverse order.
1665480	1668040	And we can play this, you know, we can run the simulations many times.
1668040	1673120	You can ask, how often does that occur versus take, take one occur versus take two?
1673120	1677520	And we can calculate the probabilities of those, of those sequences.
1677520	1681480	If we take the ratio of them and then take the log of it, we get a number, which I'm
1681500	1683000	going to call sigma.
1683000	1687760	This sigma is actually in some ways our modern, the modern version of what Gibbs was doing.
1687760	1691560	We actually now interpret that as essentially being an entropy of a sequence.
1691560	1695240	So before I was talking about an entropy of an ensemble of many copies of a system, here
1695240	1699680	we're actually defining entropy at the level of a sequence of states which we visit.
1699680	1703360	And we, we interpret that as basically the amount by which the entropy of the universe
1703360	1707440	has increased during that visiting the forward sequence of states.
1707440	1711080	So if the entropy is not increasing, right, the probability of the top is the same as
1711080	1715680	the bottom, that's one, right, the ratio is one, the log of one is zero, so entropy
1715680	1717440	is not increased, that's consistent.
1717440	1720680	And if one is much, much larger, much, much smaller than the other, then entropy is either
1720680	1724240	large, very much increasing or decreasing during the sequence.
1724240	1727880	So let me give you a concrete example of this, Humpty Dumpty, right?
1727880	1728880	Everybody knows Humpty.
1728880	1733920	This is a sequence of two events, Humpty is intact, Humpty falls, breaks, and according
1733920	1737800	to the nursery rhyme, all the king's horses and all the king's men could not put Humpty
1737800	1739920	back together again.
1739920	1745360	But they, you know, Humpty could have spontaneously reassembled, again, not violating the laws
1745360	1747760	of physics, highly, highly unlikely.
1747760	1752400	But we can calculate the ratio, so Humpty falling, Humpty breaking versus Humpty reassembling,
1752400	1757840	that number is like 10 to the 10 to the 20, that's a very, very large number.
1757840	1761760	And how does that, you know, by converting it to entropy in the, in using the formula
1761760	1768240	from the previous slide, that corresponds about, about 10 to the 20 K of entropy released
1768240	1769240	into the universe.
1769240	1774520	So the universe has crept up that much closer towards heat death by Humpty falling.
1774520	1780960	Now here's then the crucial part for the next several, you know, slides of the talk.
1780960	1781960	That's fine.
1781960	1784560	So that's kind of, and this is, this is this law, this, this idea that I've shown you applies
1784560	1788640	just as well for Humpty's subsystems, the living things, you know, it doesn't, it's
1788640	1792000	a law that applies to subsystems as well as the whole universe.
1792000	1795720	But how does the entropy of the universe increase when Humpty falls?
1795720	1800600	And it turns out that this increase is just heat release, right?
1800600	1810000	It's about 0.2 calories, so not a huge amount of heat, but that's, oh, are we, okay, yeah.
1810000	1815320	So it's not a huge amount of heat release, but it's some amount of heat has been released
1815320	1817760	into, into the, into the surroundings.
1817760	1820760	And why does the universal entropy kind of increase there?
1820760	1823880	Because when we give energy to the surroundings, the surroundings in some ways can explore
1823880	1831280	more addresses, and hence the entropy of the universe as a whole is increasing, right?
1831280	1836280	So that's going to be kind of crucial because this is how typically we pay our due to entropy
1836280	1842480	as, you know, subsystems of the universe, we tend to release heat, dissipate heat, right?
1842480	1843480	Okay.
1844480	1850280	Let me give you a kind of a more down-to-earth example of this, where we are releasing heat.
1850280	1851520	So this is a circuit, right?
1851520	1855760	We attach a battery to a circuit, and, you know, a motor to that, to that circuit.
1855760	1859360	There's some heat being dissipated.
1859360	1861720	Now what's going on here, right?
1861720	1863280	Why doesn't there need to be heat dissipated?
1863280	1868240	Well, the electrons in that wire, if we didn't have the battery attached, would just be more
1868240	1870560	or less moving in random directions, right?
1870560	1871960	There would be no preferred direction.
1871960	1876960	So one kind of sequence of electrons motion to the left would be equally probable to another
1876960	1880160	sequence of electron motions to the right.
1880160	1884520	But in when we have a current flowing through the system, one of those sequences becomes
1884520	1886200	much more likely than the other, right?
1886200	1891160	There's a preferred direction for the electrons to move through our wire.
1891160	1894280	Based on the argument that I just showed you, because there's now this preferred sequence
1894280	1899040	of states which the system visits, the entropy of the universe must increase.
1899040	1900040	How does it increase?
1900040	1902800	Well, heat has to be dissipated, right?
1902800	1904960	Okay, heat is a form of energy.
1904960	1906600	It's being released into the environment.
1906600	1907600	Where does that energy come from?
1907600	1909520	There must be an energy source, right?
1909520	1910720	That's why you have to have a battery.
1910720	1916240	So in a weird way, in this kind of inverted thermodynamic perspective, I argue the existence
1916240	1922600	of the battery by the fact that first there's a symmetry breaking in the motion of the electrons.
1922600	1926840	But for me, that heat, that we take it for granted, you know, we plug things in, you
1926840	1930400	know, our electronics are all heated up, things like that.
1930400	1937080	That kind of very mundane aspect of our daily lives is, in fact, all the objects around
1937080	1939360	us are paying to the second law of thermodynamics.
1939360	1943280	So this heat dissipation is essentially the entropy price because those electrons are
1943280	1946440	moving in a preferred direction.
1946440	1949260	Because there's this other law of thermodynamics which I have not emphasized, called the first
1949260	1954800	law, more or less the energy conservation, the power in minus the power out is equal
1954800	1956120	to the power dissipated, right?
1956120	1961280	So you have to have more power in than power out in order to have dissipated heat, right?
1961280	1965400	So you have to have an energy source that's larger than the power that the motor is using.
1965400	1971080	All right, this is a much more concise way of explaining this.
1971080	1972640	This is stupid.
1972640	1975480	Don't do this.
1975480	1982480	Those electrons in that wire are not going to spontaneously begin moving around in a circle
1982480	1985640	because there's no power source.
1985640	1987240	Okay.
1987240	1991200	So now let's now switch gears a little bit.
1991200	1997040	So everything that I've talked so far have been addresses that have lived, positions
1997040	2003040	and directions, positions and directions of electrons or particles and stadium.
2003040	2005720	The power of this concept is that address could be anything.
2005720	2009240	It could be a chemical, it could be a step in a chemical cycle.
2009240	2012920	So this is one of these famous cycles that if you have memories of high school biology,
2012920	2016360	probably brings you back some nightmares of memorization.
2016360	2019960	We're not going to go through the details of these kind of metabolic cycles, but note
2019960	2024040	that whenever the people draw these cycles, always the arrows primarily in one direction.
2024040	2025040	Why?
2025040	2026280	Because that's how it happens in our bodies.
2026280	2029760	It primarily goes in one direction rather than the other.
2029760	2030760	What does that mean?
2030760	2033640	It means that we have now a sequence of states more likely to go in one direction than the
2033640	2034640	other.
2034640	2036400	Well, we've got to pay our due to the second law.
2036400	2038240	That means heat has to be dissipated, right?
2038240	2044120	So there's going to be some necessary entropic price to pay.
2044120	2050040	So let me give you kind of one very famous example of such a cycle.
2050040	2052280	So this is the ATP synthase protein.
2052280	2057720	So this is a protein that essentially synthesizes this energy molecule called ATP, which then
2057720	2061000	runs a lot of the other biological processes in our body.
2061000	2066800	And those biological processes degrade that energy molecule back into ATP and phosphate.
2066800	2068520	And this protein actually spins around.
2068520	2073360	It's kind of this interesting rotor complex, and it spins around primarily in one direction
2073360	2078640	so long as you have an imbalance of ions on one side of a membrane versus the other.
2078640	2087360	In that previous work where you were bouncing the particles around the racetrack, just as
2087360	2093880	a problem, I would ask what would happen if the racetrack was elliptical and you started
2093880	2096640	out at one focus of the ellipse?
2096640	2100480	I don't think there would be chaos.
2100480	2107840	I have not explored all possible shapes, but I do think if ellipses were, I would have
2107840	2109520	heard about it in some ways.
2109520	2112400	Like it requires a particular combinations of shapes.
2112400	2119760	An array of light that goes through one focus will wind up at the other focus.
2119760	2123720	So that would argue against the fact that things are going to become disordered inside
2123720	2126040	that ellipse.
2126040	2130200	But I think it would not become disordered in the same way.
2130200	2132600	I may have missed this.
2132600	2133600	Excuse me.
2133600	2137440	What is the actual definition of the word entropy?
2137440	2143040	So used in this talk, and I wanted to be kind of very clear so that there isn't this confusion.
2143040	2150200	The definition of entropy is this thing here in the blue box.
2150200	2157360	So you take a system, you divide it up into a state space, addresses which denote the states
2157360	2158360	of the system.
2158360	2162200	You have probabilities associated with being at a particular address at a certain time.
2162200	2166440	You take those probabilities, you multiply them by the logarithm, you add them all up.
2166440	2167440	That's entropy.
2167440	2169440	Could you give me a sentence?
2169440	2172000	A sentence, okay.
2172000	2177760	So the less mathematical definition would be, it would be a measure of how spread out
2177760	2180080	that probability is, how disordered the system is.
2180080	2183440	How disordered the problem is.
2183440	2187480	How spread out the probability is, which you can interpret in a way as how disordered
2187480	2188720	the system is.
2188720	2192580	Because the more spread out you are, the more addresses you live in, the more different
2192580	2196040	combinations are possible that you see in the system.
2196040	2199080	So when entropy is zero, everything lives at one address.
2199080	2204600	When entropy is large, everything is, all addresses are equally likely to occur.
2204600	2207680	And there's a roof to help for how I...
2207680	2208680	Exactly.
2208680	2209680	Right?
2209680	2213080	So if this was a completely empty city and all of us sitting here in the audience were
2213080	2217480	in this particular room, and let's say we divided up the city into boxes of the side
2217480	2220840	of this room, the entropy of our population would be zero.
2220840	2225400	But then if you guys all went out and equally like uniformly spread out throughout all of
2225400	2230880	the Cleveland area so that there was a uniform population density of you everywhere, then
2230880	2232200	your entropy would be maximum.
2232200	2235680	That would be the most disordered that you could become.
2235680	2237520	And it's different for different systems.
2237520	2239040	It's completely different for different systems.
2239040	2242040	Even in the notion of what an address is, that's why I kind of use this word address.
2242040	2245240	I mean, in physics we call it phase space, but that's more technical.
2245240	2249000	But like what I'm claiming is that this idea of addresses works just as well in chemistry
2249000	2252320	as it does for actual physical positions.
2252320	2258080	We hope you've been enjoying the Origin Science Scholars Program with Professor Michael Hynchewski.
2258080	2263120	Professor Hynchewski is the Warren E. Ropp assistant professor in the Department of Physics
2263120	2268400	at Case Western Reserve University, specializing in theoretical biophysics.
2268400	2274760	In the second part of our talk, we learned how life is a cascade of energy conversion
2274760	2276720	and dissipation.
2276720	2281800	In our final segment, Professor Hynchewski will talk about thermodynamics and the origin
2281800	2282800	of life.
2282800	2285640	Now, back to our talk.
2285640	2290520	So if you take a, you know, again, comparing or going back to this comparison with a battery,
2290520	2293020	it seems like a very, very different system, right?
2293020	2296800	So we have, but when I argue it's not that much different, right?
2296800	2301740	So on one hand we have a system that's kind of, has some preferred direction, right?
2301740	2306900	Here it's the mode, it's the proteins, you know, preferably going in one direction.
2306900	2309860	Here it was the electrons preferably going in one direction around the wire.
2309860	2313340	We have some process that's going on where energy is being utilized.
2313340	2314740	Here it's the synthesis of ATP.
2314740	2318340	Here it's the motor turning.
2318340	2320140	We have some power source.
2320140	2321140	Here it's a battery.
2321140	2323700	This was just such a chemical potential energy.
2323700	2328140	Here that battery is in something, the imbalance of ions on one side of the membrane versus
2328140	2329300	the other.
2329300	2333100	And as a necessary sort of consequence of the second law of thermodynamics, heat has to
2333100	2334100	be released.
2334100	2337660	There has to be some amount of loss of energy through heat.
2337660	2341380	Now if you let both of these systems run indefinitely, what would happen?
2341380	2343700	Well, your battery would become depleted.
2343700	2345100	It would go to equilibrium, right?
2345100	2347420	The electrons would stop moving in a preferred direction.
2347420	2350620	Here if you kept on running this thing forever, eventually this, there would be the equal
2350620	2353900	number of ions on one side of the membrane versus the other.
2353900	2358820	And now your protein would begin to have, it would still kind of move, but in random
2358820	2361020	ways and not with a preferred direction.
2361020	2363500	So basically your battery would become depleted.
2363500	2367380	So what happens in nature is, well, in our case, sometimes you switch out the batteries,
2367380	2369780	maybe it's a rechargeable battery, we can recharge it.
2369780	2373460	In nature we pump out, we pump those ions continuously back out, right?
2373460	2378460	How that pumping occurs differs from organism to organism.
2378460	2383340	And in our case, it's we ingest food and some of that energy is being converted into pumping
2383340	2385700	out those ions.
2385700	2387980	Let me give you one kind of very simple example.
2387980	2394860	This is from a simple bacterium where that pumping occurs because of another protein called
2394860	2397020	bacteria rhodopsin on the membrane.
2397020	2402340	And it basically interacts with photons from sunlight and uses that energy from the photons
2402340	2408060	to basically drive its own cycle of pumping where it pumps those ions back out.
2408060	2410500	On the other side of the membrane, then you have an imbalance form.
2410500	2416460	That imbalance then is used to power this ATP synthase to basically produce the ATP,
2416460	2418540	then that drives other biological processes, right?
2418540	2423300	And this is one particular example, but in some ways everything that we know about life
2423300	2425780	is kind of built on kind of these nested cycles, right?
2425780	2428340	So I'm going to kind of draw it like this, right?
2428340	2431300	So you might have some fundamental energy source on top.
2431300	2433140	In this case, it was a photon.
2433140	2436300	That energy source powered a cycle which created a certain imbalance.
2436740	2441180	In this case, it was an ion gradient, so more ions on one side of the membrane to the other.
2441180	2445380	That ion gradient, that imbalance, in turn then powered a different imbalance, right?
2445380	2450180	Another cycle primarily in one direction of the ATP synthase protein, which then in turns
2450180	2454820	powers other cycles driven primarily in one direction, all of our metabolic cycles and
2454820	2456940	cell division, things like this.
2456940	2461940	At every step, because we are driving things primarily in one direction, so we're breaking
2461940	2465900	the symmetry, we have to pay our dues to the second law.
2465900	2467500	So we have to dissipate energy.
2467500	2471780	We have to, there has to be some heat release at every single step of the process.
2471780	2475500	So note that because of energy conservation, that means the energy available to all the
2475500	2478140	lower tiers becomes progressively lower and lower and lower.
2478140	2480620	We're wasting energy all throughout.
2480620	2483460	But that waste is not somehow a bad thing.
2483460	2485140	It's what makes us living, right?
2485140	2487540	Because without that waste, there wouldn't be this broken symmetry.
2487540	2492460	We wouldn't have our cycles going around primarily in one direction.
2492540	2498540	So in fact, you sitting here, all of us, are releasing about 100 watts of power, which
2498540	2501820	is the old, this is not an audience where I have to remind people of what incandescent
2501820	2506340	light bulbs are, but to my students I may have to do that.
2506340	2512660	But I mean, it's about the power of an old fashioned, now old fashioned light bulb.
2512660	2518580	So that 100 watts of power releasing into the atmosphere, that is in some sense the indicator
2518580	2523260	of all the non-equilibrium thermodynamic processes going on inside of our bodies, all the biochemical
2523260	2525860	cycles being primarily driven in one direction.
2525860	2532220	The net result of that is this 100 watts that we're releasing out into the atmosphere.
2532220	2536580	So that was one thing, one particular organism.
2536580	2537980	How does it happen for others?
2537980	2541780	Well, it turns out that from this kind of cascade, there are two parts that are really
2541780	2545660	universal to all known life that we see around us.
2545660	2550540	One is the ion gradient of some kind, the other is ATP as this energy molecule, as this
2550540	2551540	currency.
2551540	2557420	What drives the ion gradient is now, in modern living organisms, is not universal anymore.
2557420	2562660	In some cases here it was a photon, in us it's ingesting of other material.
2562660	2567260	For bacteria living near hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the ocean, might be some
2567260	2572060	chemical sources which drive this.
2572060	2576780	So that becomes that first step in the top part of the cascade is no longer universal.
2576780	2580780	And of course, the things that we do with ATP differ from different organisms, so that's
2580780	2582780	no longer universal.
2582780	2586940	But in some sense, if we're trying to think of this as these nested chemical cycles where
2586940	2593740	one thing, one imbalance drives another, dissipating heat along the way, ultimately speaking, tracing
2593740	2599020	this evolutionary history back to the beginning of time, there had to be some fundamental original
2599020	2605980	imbalance that drove the first glimmers, the first echoes of these kind of cycles forward.
2605980	2611900	Where things were driven out of an equilibrium state to primarily go into one direction.
2611900	2615860	And on earth it turns out that if you do this kind of detective work, going forensically,
2615860	2621140	going back in time, everything that we see around us, that's interesting in some sense.
2621140	2626500	All things that are not in equilibrium, so air currents, ocean currents, plate tectonics,
2626500	2628180	all the chemical cycles in life.
2628180	2632700	And I'm trying to argue that mathematically we can lump all of these things together as
2632700	2639140	being different versions of the symmetry is broken, where things are going around in currents.
2639140	2645100	All of these have to be traced back to two fundamental imbalances.
2645100	2651260	And those are the fact that we're sitting next to a star which is bombarding us with
2651260	2658980	photons, beautiful source, they're transient on the scale of billions of years of energy
2658980	2660500	that can drive imbalances.
2660500	2666020	The other is geological, the fact that there's heat released as the core of the earth kind
2666020	2667020	of solidifies.
2667020	2672220	There are radioactive elements in the mantle that are decaying which provides heat.
2672220	2676420	So kind of geological and solar are really our two sources.
2676420	2681940	And unsurprisingly, there are two major camps in the origins of life field.
2681940	2688420	People who think that maybe life emerged in kind of like shallow surface lakes exposed
2688420	2694780	to sunlight, or people who think that maybe life emerged in deep ocean hydrothermal events.
2694780	2698340	Where we kind of have this clear division between these two imbalances, then of course
2698340	2700020	there could be combinations of the two.
2700020	2704700	You can have shallow surface lakes at Yellowstone or Yellowstone like things where there's some
2704700	2707660	kind of geothermal aspects to it as well.
2707660	2712620	But the field kind of breaks into two camps and can we use thermodynamics in some sense
2712620	2717620	to kind of maybe give an edge to one camp versus the other.
2717620	2723660	And again, I'm not going to say anything definitive, so this is still an ongoing question and there
2723660	2727620	are mechanisms by which both origins might work.
2727620	2731900	But this is actually, this is a kind of complicated graph, but let me walk you through it.
2731900	2734020	On the horizontal axis, think of this as energy.
2734020	2739340	And this is energy now measured here in terms of units of milli-electron volts.
2739340	2743380	It doesn't really matter what the units are, but from low to high.
2743380	2747900	And here we also see the corresponding energies of photons, where visible photons, the light
2747900	2752140	from the visible spectrum part of light is about this range of energies.
2752140	2757060	Above that is the so-called ultraviolet part of the electromagnetic spectrum.
2757060	2762860	Here in this green range are energies typically associated with biochemical processes, like
2762860	2765420	for example ATP hydrolysis, things like this.
2765420	2766780	This is membrane potential energy.
2766780	2771100	So they live in this kind of infrared range of the spectrum.
2771100	2775900	On the bottom of this graph are ranges of energies available from certain sources.
2775900	2780140	So here in blue is water heated up to its critical temperature, beyond which it is no
2780140	2781980	longer liquid in some sense.
2781980	2788340	Here is like the energies available from like lava, like molten rock at really high temperatures.
2788340	2794220	This orange curve is the energy available from the sun, the solar spectrum.
2794220	2799660	And out here at really much higher things are basically intermittent strikes of lightning.
2799660	2804900	Now if we think about this kind of range of sources, you can say, well look, molten rock,
2804900	2810020	water temperatures, high water temperatures, they do kind of give us, get us within the
2810020	2813740	ballpark of what we see as biochemical energies.
2813740	2817660	But then if we consider now what I've tried to argue over the last few slides, the fact
2817660	2821540	that we do have to pay this due to a second law, there has to be dissipation.
2821540	2826780	So your energy input has to be larger than what you're using the energy for.
2826780	2831180	We would in principle want to gravitate to like the largest persistent source of energy
2831180	2833060	available to us.
2833060	2838380	And that's pretty much the UV part of the spectrum of photons from the sun.
2838380	2843500	Those are kind of the highest energy sources that are constantly available to us, bombarding
2843500	2848340	us all the time, and basically have the largest allowance, the largest gap between that amount
2848340	2854380	of energy and the energy that we're using for biological processes.
2854380	2859180	And this in some sense is then the thermodynamic argument for why a photon-based, a light-based
2859180	2861380	origin of life is more plausible.
2861380	2863780	Again, it's not the final word.
2863780	2866460	This is definitely not a closed book.
2866660	2872140	Also a very high energy source, but I would argue probably too intermittent unless somebody's
2872140	2878980	willing to argue that the early earth atmosphere was lightning all the time.
2878980	2881980	But photons certainly are there.
2881980	2885060	And the other part of the thing, which is actually kind of very exciting because the
2885060	2889180	field has actually really blossomed in the last two years, there is now developments
2889180	2893220	in chemistry that support this notion.
2893220	2897900	So in particular, there's been work by Jack Sostak at Harvard, and this is John Southerl
2897900	2900180	in Cambridge.
2900180	2905020	And what they were able to finally show in the last few years is a 2015 paper, is now
2905020	2909980	there is a plausible chemistry that we can associate to making the basic elements of
2909980	2910980	life.
2910980	2914780	So lipids, which are the containers, the things that make up cell membranes, amino acids,
2914780	2920180	which are the bases of our proteins, things like RNA, nucleotides for genetic material.
2920180	2927860	All of these can be synthesized under what the field considers plausible conditions similar
2927860	2933540	to early earth, and critically, the catalyst here is ultraviolet light.
2933540	2939420	So there seems to be in some ways this, again, this is a plausibility argument.
2939420	2944580	It's not a definitive thing, but we can say, UV light is then, thermodynamically speaking,
2944580	2946900	the most attractive option for an origin of life.
2946900	2952820	And now we have a plausible chemistry driven by UV light that can actually lead to the
2952820	2955220	synthesis of these types of living materials.
2955220	2958900	Again, is this the actual chemistry that occurred in earlier life?
2958900	2964820	We will probably never know that for certain, but these are different pieces of the puzzle
2964820	2967700	that we're putting together.
2967700	2971060	So we're coming towards the end of the talk.
2971060	2978060	So what I want to emphasize at the end is, again, we think of chemistry and all these
2978060	2982340	other things like hurricanes to be really two very, very different things.
2982340	2985700	What I want to argue is that they're really truly connected to each other in this deep
2985700	2993580	mathematical way through the notion of entropy, and that all these processes are all connected
2993580	2996060	through non-equilibrium thermodynamics.
2996060	3000740	And it's kind of the line of argument that I tried to make tonight is something along
3000740	3001740	the following.
3001740	3006580	So if you see a current, if you see this symmetry breaking where a certain sequence of events
3006580	3011140	is more likely than the reverse, that necessarily implies there has to be some entropy increase
3011140	3012580	in the universe.
3012580	3017460	That entropy increase typically occurs through dissipation of heat into the environment.
3017460	3020860	OK, if heat is dissipated into the environment, what does that mean?
3020860	3027260	That means it requires a persistent power input, because you're losing energy, so that
3027260	3032820	energy has to be coming from something, and this is more or less what the kind of conceptual
3032820	3034940	framework what it boils down to.
3034940	3039860	What's interesting is this will apply just as well to exoplanets as it does to Earth.
3039860	3045420	These are universal aspects of what we understand to be laws of physics, and so any mechanism
3045420	3052740	we think of life arising anywhere else still has to obey these basic thermodynamic ideas.
3052740	3058820	And I just to kind of wrap up, this particular notion is kind of interwoven cascades of chemical
3058820	3063900	cycles where you start with like a photon on top and then, you know, dissipate energy
3063900	3064900	throughout.
3064900	3069500	I was discussing this in one of my classes, and a colleague, Robin Snyder, was a theoretical
3069500	3070500	ecologist.
3070500	3074620	She pointed out this beautiful, beautiful quote from Primo Levy, which summarizes this much,
3074620	3076700	much better and more eloquently than I could.
3076700	3080020	This is from a short story of his called Carbon, which I highly recommend.
3080020	3082140	Just go Google it and read it.
3082140	3086700	And the way he described it is like this, such as life and inserting itself, a drawing
3086700	3092180	off to its advantage, a parasitizing of the downward course of energy from its noble solar
3092180	3095180	form to the degraded one of low temperature heat.
3095180	3100900	In this downward course, which leads to equilibrium and thus death, life draws a bend and nests
3100900	3101900	in it.
3101900	3106620	And I think that beautifully kind of encapsulates in some ways the transient nature of all this,
3106620	3107620	right?
3107620	3110780	Because remember, as, you know, we're arguing here that entropy is increasing.
3110780	3115300	All of this depends on this entropy increase that can only go on for so long, right?
3115300	3119180	So all these beautiful things that we see, all these beautiful patterns, these complicated
3119180	3123660	structures, inherent in their physics is, of course, their transience and their eventual
3123660	3125160	death through equilibrium.
3125160	3130020	So in some ways, like, you know, we're, you know, it's kind of a mixed blessing.
3130020	3132700	We have all these beautiful things, but they won't last forever.
3132700	3137780	Do you see ATP in viruses, in prions?
3137780	3143980	So viruses basically are just kind of protein capsids incorporating genetic material.
3143980	3147500	So in order to actually copy themselves, they have to insert themselves into a host like
3147500	3151460	a bacterium, for example, and they use the machinery, the metabolic machinery of the
3151460	3153100	host to make the copy.
3153100	3154100	Yeah.
3154100	3160220	Well, I mean, the virus in itself just sitting there is not, you know, you know, if there's
3160220	3164340	no active biochemical cycle there, I wouldn't call that life.
3164340	3167860	Once it's inserted there, it becomes a component of active biochemical cycles, and then in
3167860	3170220	some sense, it becomes a part of a living thing.
3170220	3178060	So do you come down on the metabolism first versus, you know, a nucleic acid or a brain?
3178060	3179060	Yes.
3179060	3183820	So part of, okay, so again, this is more kind of, you know, I'm a physicist, not a chemist,
3183820	3189460	but I think part of what this kind of work that I showed here is arguing is in some sense
3189460	3193460	the answer to the, you know, which came first, the chicken and the egg is both.
3194220	3199780	That you can have a chemistry where all the various elements that you need can arise more
3199780	3204460	or less simultaneously, and that in some sense seems the most plausible case because it's
3204460	3210420	really hard to think of, you know, containers containing nothing, you know, things that
3210420	3214620	need to be replicated like genetic material without the mechanisms, you know, the machinery
3214620	3215900	to replicate them, right?
3215900	3220540	So in some sense, you kind of would like as, you know, in something as an Occam's razor
3220540	3224500	kind of most simplest thing, that somehow these, all things more or less arose around
3224500	3225500	the same time.
3225500	3228620	Again, whether there could be more complicated mechanisms by which you have one thing existing
3228620	3230140	right before the other.
