The Institute advances the scientific understanding and application of origins and evolution of human and natural systems. The Origins Science Scholars Lectures are presented with the assistance of Case Western Reserve University's Segal Lifelong Learning Program, College of Arts and Sciences, and Media Vision. This evening, it's my pleasure to welcome Professor Joseph Lamana, the Gene M. and Joseph S. Silber Professor of Brain Sciences, and Professor in the Department of Physiology and Biophysics. Professor Lamana is an expert on blood flow and metabolism in the brain, on the adaptation to hypoxia, which is the lack of oxygen. He served as president of several learned societies, and it's my pleasure to welcome here tonight to talk about the origin of mitochondria. Please join me in welcoming Professor Silber. Today we're talking about mitochondria, and it's going to be in three parts. The first is going to be about the origin of life. We can't talk about the origin of mitochondria without talking about the origin of life. You'll see why shortly. Part two will be about the origin of mitochondria themselves, and then the three will see how they had a role in the development and evolution of multicellular animals. To begin with, we have to talk about the time frame. This is called the biogeologic clock, and it breaks up the four plus billion years of earth history into a nice circle, which shows that for most of the existence of the earth, there was not multicellular animals. So we have first is the period here where the earth is formed, and it's beginning to cool, and within a billion years or so, we have the origin of life, the first evidence that life exists there, and then for most of the existence, most of these billion years after that, there's not much in the way of multicellular life. So the single cell life began almost as soon as the earth was cool enough for life to occur. So we're going to look at when it began, the conditions under which it began, and some leading hypotheses about what generated life to begin with, and then what changed, how the conditions changed. Important to all of this is the consideration of energy. That's the ability to generate and manipulate energy that defines life. The basic ingredients for life, once the conditions cool on earth enough so that the chemicals remain stable, you need energy, which can be in the form of light, heat, or chemical energy. You need the chemical components. These are the molecules, organic molecules. They had to come from somewhere, and they had to get there first. And then you need water, and so that's part of the conditions on earth had to be cool enough for liquid water to be available. So to get right to it, we have evidence from microbial mats of life existing at about three and a half billion years, pretty strong evidence. We have the earliest physical evidence at about 3.7, but we also have a theoretical belief or theoretical understanding that life could have occurred in hydrothermal vents at about four billion years ago. And this is a description of the eons of the earth showing these particular eons. We have the Hadean eon named for Hades, as you might expect, because apparently the conditions there are what we think of as hell, with the sulfurous volcanoes and bubbling molten magma. And then you have the Archaian period, and this is the period under which life first arose. You have then a long period of time in the protozoic, which single cell life in the beginning of multicellularity, but not much in complexity, and then the Phanerozoic, which really means the obvious life period of time. What we notice here, I just want to mention this, this LHB is the late heavy bombardment, and that's a period of time when there were lots of meteorites hitting the planet earth, and these carried with it water, and they also, I see meteorites brought water, and also meteorites carried organic compounds, and we know from the meteorites that we've seen recently that if we calculate how much organic materials in a meteorite, and how many meteorites there were, there's plenty of possibility for carrying most organic life, organic compounds to earth by meteorites. And then you have the rise, right at about 3.6, 3.7, of bacterium archaea, which are the prokaryotes, they are single celled organisms, and they arose under conditions without oxygen. That's the most important thing. The atmosphere initially contained just hydrogen and helium, that's because most of the universe is hydrogen and helium, so when the earth coalesced first, that was the natural compounds in the environment. They're too light to stay on the earth though, earth's gravity cannot hold the light gases, and so both hydrogen and helium will leave the atmosphere reasonably quickly, and the atmosphere then becomes a mixture of what comes out of the volcanic vents, lots of volcanic gases, mostly steam and water vapor, carbon dioxide, plenty of carbon dioxide, you have sulfur and nitrogen, plus the trace gases, the noble gases that don't react so much, the argon and the neon, you have a little bit of methane, a little bit of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. Now what we were taught in school, probably when you took biology, you were taught the primordial atmosphere consisted of hydrogen, ammonia, methane, water and hydrogen sulfide, which are the most reduced forms of the biological elements, nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen and sulfur, or oxygen and sulfur. This has to be revised a little bit because under those conditions that we now know to be present, there could not be much ammonia or methane, they would have been further metabolized, but so we add nitrogen instead of ammonia and we add carbon dioxide instead of methane, and the UV light will be breaking down some of the water vapor into a little bit of oxygen, but as soon as any oxygen will be made, it will react with minerals in the crust of the earth and be pulled out of the atmosphere, and the hydrogen that was left would also leave via the kinetic energy in insufficient gravity. But the most important thing is that this was in a reducing atmosphere, no oxygen, or less than one part per million oxygen, very low oxygen, and it seems like that's a requirement for life to have a reason. Now there's lots of theories on the origin of life, it's been discussed for as long as people have been around, they've discussed origins, and you remember also from your biology about theories of spontaneous generation and life from non-life that were discussed prior to people like Pasteur who showed that this was not possible. We had Darwin talk about the warm little pond which got sunlight, which had some organic chemicals on which life could arise from there. We had the experiments of people like Miller and Ure and Fox, which took the elements expected of the primordial atmosphere, put electrical sparks in, and got organic compounds out of it. We also have hypotheses where these organic compounds could line up on community clay, this is clay along the beach, that would act as a place for to catalyze reactions among these compounds. The Chile start hypothesis, which if you had the snowball earth and a frozen seas, would protect the ocean from UV light and allow the chemicals to react and form life. A radioactive beach hypothesis, this is radioactive chemicals along the shoreline producing the heat necessary to provide the energy for this. I mentioned meteorites being able to provide organic compounds. More recently, they only were discovered in the 70s, some hydrothermal vents, deep sea vents, when these deep sea submersibles started exploring the sea bottom, and they found these areas where obvious venting was coming from the sea floor, and lo and behold, there were things living there, way out of the sunlight, at 100 atmospheres of pressure, at temperatures approaching 200 degrees C, and amazing, we call those extremophiles, that is organisms that live in extreme environments. These were suggested to people like Gunter Wachteschauser, that life might have originated there, making use of the iron and sulfur minerals as catalysts. The black smokers had sulfide, they were very close to the magma and very hot, the white smokers a little further away, a little cooler, a little more alkaline, and there was hydrogen available to get energy from, and the idea that hydrogen metabolism may have been the first energy available for life to arise, and of course any or all of these might be contributing, that is a multiple genesis hypothesis. Now once you had life, part of the chemical process using getting energy from hydrogen and methane and carbon dioxide produced oxygen as a byproduct, so this is, in a reducing anoxic environment, oxygen being released as a waste product is a toxic product. So as the environment gathered more and more oxygen, there would be adaptations to make use of this toxic waste product in a positive way. Before oxygen could accumulate, it had to react with all of the reduced iron that was floating around in the oceans. The oceans were filled with a soluble form of reduced iron, ferrous iron, and as the oxygen came into the environment, it would react with the iron, oxidize it, and this is, well, this is rust. So you had to rust all of the iron in the ocean, and that iron doesn't, it's not dissolved, it sinks, and so these thick bands of, red bands of rust accumulated at the floor of the oceans, we call these banded iron formations, and it allows us to pinpoint fairly accurately when the oxygen was produced and when the oxygen was accumulating in the environment. We know, and this is a banded iron, example of a banded iron formation from the American Museum of Natural History in New York, but there's an example in our Natural History Museum, it used to be out front, I don't know where it is now, but it used to be right out front door as you walked in every day. So this indicates prodigious amounts of oxygen being generated during this three billion years ago to two and a half billion years ago. These banded iron formations are about two and a half billion years old in the middle on average, and at the end of this period of time we come to very close to our current atmosphere, which is an oxidizing atmosphere, with one-fifth of it being oxygen, most of the rest being nitrogen, a little bit of carbon dioxide, and there are trace noble gases. Where did that oxidizing event come from? We call it the great oxidizing event, GOE, and the best guess here is the evolution of cyanobacteria, so these are bacteria, single cell animals, which we used to call blue-green algae when we were growing up, but they're not algae, they're bacteria, and they kind of look like this. This is a picture of cyanobacterium. They grow in these mats, these are current mats that are available in Western Australia, and those are layer upon layer of cyanobacterial mats producing oxygen. These also, these cells, these single cell bacteria became the precursors of the chloroplast, which is the organelle in plants that does photosynthesis and gives us oxygen today, so that's the precursor of all plants. What happens then, the history of oxygen on Earth winds up this way, very low amounts for the first two billion years, the great oxidizing event occurs, but notice that this is a log scale, this is one percent of the current atmospheric level, one percent of that would be 0.2 percent of oxygen in the atmosphere, not 20 percent, so 20 percent is what we have now, this is a much, still a very small amount, so for two billion years oxygen was a very low level, and this is a time when mitochondria started to produce multicellular animals, and we will talk about the more current time period for oxygen in part three, but right now I'd like to just summarize part one here and then stop for some questions, and the basic points that I've mentioned are that single cell prokaryotes arise about four billion years ago in the absence of oxygen, and then cyanobacteria begin to add oxygen resulting in the great oxidation event, 2.5 billion years ago as the environment shifts from no oxygen to some oxygen. One of the earlier slides you showed the meteorites and one of the chirality, what's the Italian there? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, in the organic compounds that we use, the sugars, the amino acids, some of them are asymmetric, that is they have a left handed form and a right handed form, and the biology tends to use one or the other, in the carbohydrates it's mostly the D form, the right hand form, and amino acids tends to be the L form, what happened, the chemically they're exactly the same, so how did we get to choose one over the other, because biologically you can only use one because enzymes are like a glove in a hand, you can't put a left hand glove on a right hand. And it turns out that in the meteorites there's a chiral preference as well, it indicates that possibly we get the preference from the delivery of these compounds from space. Because you can look, they've examined meteorites for example in Antarctica, in a sterile environment, and then they analyze them and they find that they have organic compounds. Is it fair to say that the low oxygen level in early days was basically until the ferrous iron got used up and became from abundant trace levels and at that point the oxygen began, it would seem to be that for the species present to survive you had to remove oxygen somehow, and that transition not only in the percent oxygen would be a great evolutionary driver to things that could tolerate oxygen. Absolutely, rise of oxygen gives you the rise of diversity and multicellularity, the iron had to go, but also the iron reacts with, I mean sorry, the oxygen reacts with the carbon compounds as well, it's carbonates and things like that. So as the, and oxidations of the minerals in the rocks, these all get buried, but there's a cycle as they rise and get weathered that gets released back into the atmosphere, so there's a long term cycle there as well. And later on, when the iron is gone, there still is a reaction with all the carbon because the animals take the carbon and make carbon dioxide out of it by burning it with oxygen, so there's a balance between oxygen utilization and plants making the oxygen. And you had very large amounts of carbon containing organisms to allow oxygen to build up to large levels. If you get to the last slide or two, you'll see what I mean by that. Thank you for joining us. You've been watching Dr. Joe Lamana discussing the origin of life and prokaryotic cells, those lacking at distinct nucleus. For more information on the Origins Science Scholars Program, please visit the institute's website at origins.case.edu. In the next part of the talk, Dr. Lamana discusses the origin of mitochondria and of eukaryotic cells, those with nuclei. Now back to the talk. This is the, this is probably, this is the heart of the talk, this is the origin of mitochondria. Mitochondria are the cells engine that's where all cells, all eukaryote cells mean they have a nucleus. All multicellular organisms are eukaryotic. All animals, all plants, all fungi are all organisms that have mitochondria. And the mitochondria that they have are all related. That's why we know that this event occurred only once and we all have the same related mitochondria. So let's move along. All cells need energy to function. All cells use the same organelle. That's the mitochondria. And the kind of the currency, the energy currency of the biology is adenosine triphosphate, ATP. It has a high energy phosphate on the third one and enzymes that can take that phosphate off also get a lot of energy from it and ATP becomes ADP, diphosphate from triphosphate and you get a lot of energy from it. And the mitochondria takes the ADP, makes ATP for us. And it looks something like this, kind of looks like a bacterium and that was obvious to the people who first saw them. It's double membrane organism, like a bacterial cell, and it's got its own genetic material in it as well as the ability to make its own proteins, got ribosomes and the ability to make its own proteins. I'll talk more about how this works a little bit later in part three. But in most typical eukaryotic cells have the nucleus, which is number two here, followed by number five, which is a lot of the protein making machinery, this is Golgi apparatus. But here's our friend, the mitochondrion, which is providing the energy for all the work done by the eukaryotic cells. And eukaryotic cells are about 10 times bigger than bacteria, because bacteria about the same size as mitochondria. So you get an idea of the size orientation. They were originally seen by histologists who were, these are just barely at the edge of visibility in a light level microscope. And people like Altman thought they looked like bacteria. It wasn't sure whether they were bacteria, but they looked like bacteria. He referred to them as bioblasts. Here they were named mitochondria from the Greek, which means thread-like granules, because as Benda looked at it, he saw that they were connected with little bulges on them, looked like a thread that had granules along it. And it was known from biological dyes that they were associated with living cells. You couldn't stain them if the cell was dead. If the cell was alive, they took up this dye. And because of that, it was suggested that they were involved in the oxygen respiration, that is, the utilization of oxygen to make energy. And it was really confirmed after World War II by a lender who wrote the classic textbook on biochemistry that, indeed, this is the organelle that makes ATP from oxygen and substrate. There's a whole story involved in the electron transport chain that's maybe for another time. Now in the mid-60s, Lynn Margulis proposed that these mitochondria not only looked like bacteria, but they must have come from, they must be bacteria. And so she proposed the bacterial origin of mitochondria and was able to publish her paper in the Journal of Theoretical Biology in 1967 using her married name. She was married to Carl Sagan. So Lynn Sagan published this. It was rejected in 14 journals before it was published in the Journal of Theoretical Biology because it was a crazy idea of mitochondria coming from bacteria. But they look like bacteria. They have the same genetic base pair distribution. New karyotic cells have more of the AT base pair than the CG, but bacterial and mitochondrial DNA have equal amounts of those pairs. They have no histones. They don't fold up. They have a different ribosome to make protein from. And in every case, the bacterial and the mitochondrial are identical. So we have come to understand that Lynn Margulis was indeed correct and mitochondria started out as bacteria. And the idea was an archaea, a protea, it's another prokaryote, but not a bacterium, an archaea. It's a different domain of life, had different characteristics, engulfed a proteobacterium. The proteobacterium was able to resist the digestive attempts of the archaea. And then a symbiotic relationship occurred. They had different metabolic processes that turned out to be synergistic. This may or may not have happened quite a few times, but at least one time it worked so well that it dominated life from then on. So you have the generation of the first eukaryote cell. And it required a nucleus to occur to sequester the DNA from the host cell so that it wouldn't mix up too badly with the DNA from the bacterium. But a lot of eukaryote DNA comes from bacterial sources. Just on the DNA differences, a nuclear DNA made with base pairs, coils and then coils again and then the coils coil and the coils coil again, and it's covered with histones that keep it from just generating all kinds of mRNA until it's needed. Whereas bacterial cells like this E. coli have these plasmids, these kind of circles of DNA that are same as mitochondria. Now the nuclear DNA in each cell, human cell, there's about 10 feet of DNA if you stretch it out in each cell. So you took all your DNA and stretched out end to end. You could go back and forth to the moon 70 times. That's a lot of DNA coiled up very tightly in each cell. On the other hand, and there's only one copy per cell. In mitochondria, mitochondria have smaller genomes, only 13 genes. Those bacteria that became mitochondria have lost a lot of their genes. And there's 5 to 10 copies, these plasmids, in each mitochondrian. And there's multiple mitochondria, maybe hundreds per cell. So there's a lot of copies of the mitochondrial genome that mitochondria can divide independently. And the copies of the DNA can be reproduced fairly quickly compared to the nuclear DNA. So as I say, the mitochondrial genome, it's kind of a circular plasmid type DNA, and it has 13 to 20 genes that are the minimum required for the mitochondria to control certain of its functions locally. The reason it does it is that sometimes the mitochondria can be very far from the cell nucleus. Imagine a nerve cell where the nucleus is in the spinal cord and the axon goes all the way down to the big toe. That's a long distance away from the nucleus if you depend upon the nucleus to be making the proteins you need. And also to be able to respond to local energy demand, you need local control. So the significance of mitochondrial DNA is we get all our mitochondria from our mothers. The egg has the mitochondria, the sperm uses all the mitochondria it has, its energy to get to the egg, but only one set of mitochondria are left. And we can use that evidence to look at, by looking at rates of mitochondrial mutation, to predict when the first human mitochondria appeared. And that would have been in our maternal line, so we call that first human eve, and we think maybe it was 170,000 years ago, although there's a lot of speculation, there's a lot of work that goes into this. It's not a done story by any means. And also mitochondria help control what we call apoptosis. This is a Greek word that refers to things like where the leaves fall off the trees in the autumn. It's a programmed cell death, or it's like a cell suicide, and this is triggered when the energy capacity or the energy system, the mitochondria, gets so damaged that they can no longer provide energy for the cell, then they trigger the death of the cell so that it can be phagocytized and doesn't gum up the work, so to speak. And it's also very important to study the mitochondrial DNA as we get towards understanding mitochondrial aging. And Nick Lane, who is a good scientist and also a good writer, this is an interesting book on the subject, if you're interested, called Power Sex and Suicide, and it's all about mitochondria. And he's pointing out that the fact that life occurred almost immediately when it was available in its single cell form was not that remarkable, but multicellularity depended upon a unique event, and that is a synergistic endosymbiosis to have it occurred. Once it occurred, it only happened that once, while mitochondria are related. We think it comes from purple bacteria. These have a chlorophyll-like substance, they have different colors in them, they can't live with oxygen, they use sulfur for their energy system. And the other side of it is the archaea, these are what would be called the pioneer organism in the iron sulfur world theory. These are methane, these are methanogens, meaning they make methane, they get their energy from CO2 and hydrogen, but the problem is hydrogen is scarce, so finding sources of hydrogen is crucial for these cells. They're not bacteria and they're not eukaryotes, they have a different cell membrane, it's polysaccharitic, and they can go anywhere because they make their own energy from light or from chemical processes. These are some of the places where they occur. These are the black smokers, they're black because they have sulfur compounds, they exist near magma in the deep ocean trenches, this is where the continents are pulling apart, the plates are moving apart, magma heats the water, spews all kinds of minerals here, it's very rich in minerals, there's no oxygen but there's plenty of other sources of chemical energy and of course you have thermal energy. And if you look at the one on the right, there's tube worms and what are called squat lobsters, I don't know, but these are deep sea vents located maybe at two and three kilometers depth, so a hundred atmospheres pressure where the water maybe four or five hundred degrees in the case of the black smoker, it's still liquid because of the pressure, and it's a very acidic environment, that was for the black smokers, I just said most of this. The first one was discovered in 1977 as these underwater submarines started looking at mapping the seabed as a source of the iron and nickel, the reduced forms and chemosynthetic bacteria live in these, this one didn't come up, there it is, the white smoker, these were discovered only in 2000, these are a little further away from the trench so the water is cooler, these are steam that's bubbling up through the rock, instead of big holes they're from little porous labyrinthine tubes which produce lots of surface area for chemical reactions to occur and they're more alkaline than acidic and it's thought that these, the life that's here represents some of the organisms that we're familiar with, lots of barium, calcium, silicon, they make serpentinite, this is a compound of iron and magnesium and barium and calcium that has green, looks like green snakes running through it, today you can find these type of archaea in places like Yellowstone National Park, Yellowstone National Park, this is one of the geysers, it's a hot spring and it shows the steam coming out of the center of it here, yeah, but all along the side this color, the orange color is coming from the algae, the bacteria and the archaea and these are like, again like the purple bacteria, these are carotenoids and bacterial chlorophylls and the colors change with the temperature and the seasons and so sometimes they're more purple or green and sometimes more orange depends on the conditions, very very colorful, so basically in part two what we have is we have the event that occurred, we have the last eukaryotic common ancestor that is the eukaryote cell that joined an archaea with a proteobacterium that became the precursor cell of all eukaryotes going towards the future and all these, there are three domains of life, the bacterial domain, the archaean domain and the eukaryote domain and the eukaryote domain produces plants, animals, fungi and all life from eukaryote domain has mitochondria that allows them to take advantage of the changes in the environment that we're occurring and to grow into multicellular organisms and animals, so I would stop here and take some questions about mitochondrial origins. What has to happen to the bacteria? One thing it has to be able to resist being digested is food by the archaean engulfer and then it has to keep from poisoning the genes of the archaean, remember the archaean engulfer doesn't have a nucleus and so its genes are floating around and now when the bacterial releases their genes they get mixed up and most of the time that's going to be disastrous and so a lot of those engulfments that would normally have occurred are going to be worthless, damaging rather than productive, so it had to be a very tricky event that occurred that allowed the bacteria to first survive and then figure out how to keep its DNA from getting too mixed up with the other cells DNA. Have scientists now been able to do this in a laboratory setting put an archaean and a proteal bacteria together? Actually that has been seen in nature and in the lab they haven't made mitochondria but there are examples of symbiotic endosymbiotic organisms existing today. Could you make a comment about the variation in the structure of mitochondria of one species compared to another and this refers again to this question of mitochondrial eave you know and whether you know you can have a continuous feed of mitochondria from other species into another. Mitochondria are more similar than they are different. The genes that encode the local proteins and also a lot of the proteins that come from the nucleus those genes can vary but the proteins that they're producing are identical so almost all mitochondria are just mitochondria. Now there's local changes that can change them to a certain extent but they have about the they all have the cytochrome chain the electron transport chain they have about the same density of energy production the same sizes they're they're more similar than than people are similar to each other mitochondria from all different organisms. By looking at the ultra structure picture of a mitochondrian you couldn't tell where it came when they do investigation like for my sister's a brother we share the same mitochondria right you got from your mother yes from my mother right so when you go back to eave right and we go back to all these various things that the you know anthropologists find at the natural history museum those those humans do they have the same mitochondria or that hundred and seventy thousand year thing is set in stone and you cannot so every once in a while there would be a mutation that would change one of the base pairs and might not affect the protein too much it might be in a non-coding area just like in the nuclear uh uh genome so you can watch that you you can look at that going backwards you get the types uh and and you could follow the changes in in the populations of mitochondria going back you could see how often the change occurs and then you could predict how far back the first one had to be uh for this particular lineage. We hope you've been enjoying the origin science scholars program with Dr. Joe Lamana. Dr. Lamana is a Janet M and Joseph S Silver Professor for the study of brain sciences at Case Western Reserve University. In the second part of our talk we learned how early bacteria were taken up by prokaryotic cells and eventually became the cellular powerhouses we know as mitochondria. In our final segment Dr. Lamana will discuss the role of oxygen and mitochondria in the evolution of multicellular organisms. Now back to our talk. All right let's move to uh part three then and uh this involves uh it's a little jumpy here it's got the role of mitochondria so we got some examples of how mitochondria participate and the role of oxygen as the mitochondrial partner in in evolution and in extreme examples of energy consumption. So here's our mitochondrion again and the what we're going to talk about is to show how the mitochondrion can go about generating energy in a in a very uh uh outline form that I think it will make it uh understandable. Basically what the mitochondrion does is it takes the hydrogen that we get from eating food and it burns it with oxygen that we get from breathing it in from the atmosphere and when you burn the hydrogen with the oxygen you get a tremendous amount of energy from that uh and that energy then gets transferred into ATP molecules that the cells can then use to do the work of the cell. So the first step is getting the hydrogen that's done through uh the uh tca tricarboxylic acid cycle that was this that was worked out by Hans Krebs, Sir Hans Krebs in Oxford and sometimes called the Krebs cycle and I'm showing Sir Hans in a in a standard biochemistry joke of Hans Krebs riding a cycle so it could be Hans Krebs cycle uh it's required of all biochemists I think to make that joke but basically the hydrogen from sugar comes in it's converted through this cycle of compounds and enzymes and the hydrogen is transferred to the mitochondrion and this is where the carbon dioxide comes from so in changing getting the hydrogen from the food the carbon dioxide is pulled off the molecules so we breathe out the carbon dioxide and the hydrogen is passed on to the mitochondrion and then here's where the magic occurs we have a number of compartments in the mitochondrion so let me spend just a few minutes with this diagram it's a it's two membranes two membranes an outer membrane that's here number two is the outer membrane and an inner membrane and that means that there's then two spaces that are important there's the intermembrane space between the inner and outer membrane and then there's the space that is completely surrounded by the inner membrane we call this the matrix and it's in the matrix that the Krebs cycle is working to make the hydrogen available and that the cytochrome chain which is a number of these proteins lined up one after another the job that they do is to separate the electron from the proton because hydrogen is a proton and electron and so the hydrogen proton goes out into the intermembrane space and the electron goes passed on to the next member of the cytochrome chain at the end of that chain is a molecule called cytochrome oxidase it looks very similar to hemoglobin it has a pocket that oxygen can bind to and the oxygen binds in that pocket of the cytochrome oxidase the electrons come streaming down and when four reach it it turns the oxygen into water it reduces the oxygen to water and so as you have oxygen there it pulls the electrons through and as it pulls the electrons through the hydrogen is pumped out what good is that well because you have now a big difference between the amount of hydrogen in the intermembrane space and almost none in the matrix that hydrogen creates a concentration gradient and it comes pouring in through this very specialized pour which is an ATP synthase and as it comes down the energy in that gradient is used to make ATP from ADP and that's magic this is in reality each mitochondrion acts as a hydrogen fuel cell if you're familiar with hydrogen batteries and you know how much energy you can get out of it you can run a tesla from hydrogen batteries essentially right so this is the same idea that is hydrogen is separated into electrons that flow through the electric circuit and then the protons are used to or the electrons as they flow through are you are drawn away by the oxygen to make water and you have your fuel cell your battery your hydrogen battery okay so what's the advantage suppose you just burn sugar in the case of without oxygen so no oxygen this is just sugar being used to make some energy you get two ATP for an amount of sugar say and if you're a bacterium or a penicillin mold or something like that you could do just about what a mold can do not much although they do a good job on that bread lactic acid is the endpoint and this is you know if you exercise strongly you get into an oxygen debt and you build up lactic acid well you know that that you can't keep running you need to stop and get oxygen to replace the energy the burning the sugar with oxygen gives you almost 20 times as much ATP as you get from running it without oxygen it's a huge energy advantage 20 times the amount of energy and this allows the cell to do a lot more than a prokaryote can do without the oxygen burning ability i have that little marshmallow in there just to remind me to give you an example of the amount of energy and sugar when you burn it if you've you've you've burned your marshmallows over your campfires it catches fire and it burns pretty well there's a lot of energy and sugar when you burn it with a with oxygen of course the cell takes it in small pieces and turns that into ATP rather than let it burn like that and nature takes the mitochondria and it puts it where it needs to be inside the cell this is another example of of how a the different cells evolve their different structures in order to do the function that they're required and provide the energy to do that function so this is a mitochondrion that sits inside a muscle cell those striations and top and bottom are the are the muscle fibers that are going to use the energy produced by the mitochondrion and each mitochondrion essentially produces the same pretty much the same amount of energy it has about the same components so you if you look at the volume of mitochondria you can get a pretty good idea of the ability of the cell to generate you know how much energy you can generate and i have a couple of examples here that i think are pretty impressive on the left you have a muscle from a mako shark and it's these are muscle fibers that are cut in cross-section they're going in and out of the board and right next to each one of them are these mitochondria so these are mitochondria these the muscle cell this is the mitochondria very close and a lot of volume so you have essentially looks like pretty much the similar amount of volume in mitochondria producing the energy as you have in the muscle cells that are producing the work this might be similar to thinking about an electric car that has half the weight of it is batteries in order to do what it has to do the other and so this is a shark muscle so it's a cartilaginous fish but on the other side we have a mammalian tissue it's a heart muscle cardiac muscle happens to be from a mouse but it's pretty much similar here these are the the lines of the muscle so those are the ones that are pulling apart and going together and these are all mitochondria sit in the middle of these fibers of the heart this is the nucleus of the heart muscle here's a pile of mitochondria cardiac muscle about 40 percent of the volume is mitochondria that's about and there's a maybe half of it or a little more maybe is the is the striated muscle but the ratio is is pretty pretty good in brain tissue for example that ratio is about 10 percent of that volume is mitochondrial so it shows you the difference in the energy requirements brain versus heart now this is probably my my favorite one this is a hummingbird flight muscle hummingbird that beats 300 times a second and can stop and hover in the air and these uh this is really impressive these are capillaries and here's the mitochondria between the capillaries is a nucleus of a cell and there's the muscle cells here you have more mitochondria than you have muscle that makes sense if you think about it right and here's a close-up on the capillary it's a cell in the middle of that capillary and it's filled surrounded by mitochondria here's what's using oxygen what's producing the ATP here's the muscle thin strand of muscle completely surrounded by uh mitochondria so it's it's pretty impressive and you can understand how the hummingbird can accomplish what it does how the shark can accomplish what it was how the heart can accomplish what it has to do for for that length of time that you that you needed to work all right so let's go move on a little bit now and talk about the multicellular organisms in a way it's a little backward but what I did is I showed you what the capabilities of the system is once you can provide the energy and here's how it impacts things like uh uh uh evolution if you're an organism and you're working at the substrate level that's making lactate say without having the advantage of making oxygen your energy providing system is uh only about 10 efficient it's not much 10 that means if you had a predator come along and want to take advantage of the energy that you have and it grabs you and it's 10 efficient now it becomes 1 percent 10 percent of 10 percent is 1 percent and that's not a that's not a good deal it costs more to do the engulfing and the digesting than you get out of it so there's very little predation at the level of single cell organisms that are prokaryotic but with oxidative phosphorylation that allows you to use oxygen to generate energy you're around 40 percent efficient now the first person in the chain gets grabbed by the next person it's 40 percent of 40 percent and then 40 percent 40 percent 40 percent and you could develop a chain at least six layers deep before you run below one percent of the energy supply left that means that predators now have an advantage can gain an advantage in their competition with other organisms and the bigger the cell then the better the predator so predation tends to produce larger and larger cells or organisms and prey doesn't sit around waiting to be preyed on it does the same strategy and starts getting bigger for protection so when once you have this efficiency in the chain then you have the ability to really stimulate growth and diversity and development so why didn't bacteria get larger they had two billion years before the event that made mitochondria and that's because the way prokaryotes work their energy producing system those that prokaryot bacterial cell that went to become the mitochondria was still making energy based upon its own surface area and if it got bigger its energy requirements would grow with the volume by the cube but its ability to make energy would only grow by the square root of the surface area that's not a good strategy but once you put the mitochondria inside the cell you can add mitochondria you really could add them and then your energy production capacity will grow with the volume of the cell but your utilization for most cells can be or is related to the surface area that's a much more favorable relationship so bacteria we're not going to be able to get anywhere with a 10 percent energy efficiency and they couldn't grow larger anyway because of surface volume considerations and bacteria are very successful in their niche but it's a simple solution and it's not going to get complex they work very well and the successful bacteria are the ones that can divide fastest and that means you can't have a lot of genes because that takes time to reproduce your genes so the smaller the number of genes you have the faster you can reproduce and the more successful you are so the prokaryote philosophy the prokaryote strategy keeps the cells simple and small and successful but simple and small until you've got mitochondria you can't get complexity now let's look at the more modern part of the oxygen curve in the last minute or so and this represents oxygen variations that we know closer to our own time this is half a half a billion years this is from essentially the Cambrian explosion of life on to present day and if you plot in the yellow curve there oxygen levels you see it's not constant it varies up and down and what we now know from this up and down is that the rates of evolutionary diversity and the die off in the extinctions are related in a great measure to the oxygen history so that at times when oxygen is rising you have increase in diversity taking advantage of the everything that oxygen can give you in terms of energy from the mitochondria but when oxygen becomes limiting then the inefficient forms die off there's one particular there's a lot of information here but i want to focus on this one here this peak this is when oxygen reached about 35 percent in the atmosphere remember today it's 21 percent there was 35 percent that's as much it's a maximum because any more than that and the the forest would burn and you wouldn't be producing more oxygen so there's a limit and that's it right oh okay so at that time you had a higher density in the atmosphere because that was all extra oxygen and you allowed the gigantic insects and flying insects and that the only thing i had left to try to get through is just to give you some idea of what the human body does and we produce about 85 watts of energy about a good strong light bulb and we use about the 150 balloons worth of air per day and we produce a half liter of water from metabolism every day and the mitochondria in our body make essentially a hundred pounds of ATP every day by cycling ADP that's about half the body's weight of ATP cycling and that's that's the strength of the mitochondria and with that i will let's just summarize what we said and i'll say thanks and ask for final questions the origin science scholars lectures are presented by case west and reserve universities institute for the science of origins with the assistance of the
