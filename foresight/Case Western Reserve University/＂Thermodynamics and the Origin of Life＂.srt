00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
Case Western Reserve University's Institute for the Science of Origins proudly presents

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,320
the Origins Science Scholars Program.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,360
The Institute advances the scientific understanding and application of origins and evolution of

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,360
human and natural systems.

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,160
The Origins Science Scholars Lectures are presented with the assistance of Case Western

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:24,360
Reserve University's Segal Lifelong Learning Program, College of Arts and Sciences, and

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,360
Media Vision.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,320
Tonight, it's my pleasure to introduce Professor Michael Hincheski, who is the Warren E. Rupp

9
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,680
Assistant Professor in the Department of Physics here at Case Western Reserve University.

10
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,800
As Dr. Hincheski writes, random fluctuations pervade cellular biology from the level of

11
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:49,200
individual biochemical reactions to the intricate machinery responsible for transport and signaling.

12
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,680
And yet, despite the noise at all scales, collective order emerges, a bewildering hierarchy

13
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,440
of interconnected processes carefully arranged throughout the volume of the cell.

14
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:05,920
Tonight, he will tell us where that order might come from as he talks about thermodynamics

15
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,600
and the origin of life.

16
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,760
Please join me in welcoming him.

17
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,760
What I want to talk today, in some ways, the entire topic of the talk, is a field of physics

18
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,520
which maybe a lot of people have not heard of because it's not quite always in the news.

19
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,520
It's known as non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

20
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,400
It has kind of an unwieldy name, but the questions it asks are, in some ways, some of the most

21
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,920
fundamental questions we can ask about nature.

22
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,720
So in particular, one of the central aspects of it is that physical systems tend to disorder.

23
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:42,200
This is the thing, the famous concept of entropy, which is famous, in particular, for being

24
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,400
extremely confusing, not just to non-physicists, but to physicists themselves.

25
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,000
And so what I'm going to try to do in this talk, in some ways, the central theme of it,

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,100
is to hopefully make that concept a little bit less confusing, or if that fails, at least

27
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:59,280
confuse you in a way you haven't been confused before.

28
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,800
So I study biological things, so biological things are not entirely disordered.

29
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:10,920
So one of the fascinating aspects of this topic is also, despite the fact this tendency

30
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,680
toward disorder, why does complexity arise?

31
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:20,600
And this leads into very interesting questions, people debate whether how the second law influences

32
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,280
the origin of life.

33
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:28,720
So we're going to try to kind of disentangle some of the confusion in that area.

34
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,800
And most importantly, as you'll see, this is what I'm going to do with the themes of

35
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,840
the later part of the talk, at what cost.

36
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,160
So we're going to show, and of course this is obvious because we exist, that indeed complexity

37
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:45,520
does exist in nature, but it comes at an inherent cost, a thermodynamic cost, which

38
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,120
will explicate.

39
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:54,560
And kind of putting all these ideas together, what can they tell us about how life arose?

40
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,120
Can they actually give us some clues as to the fundamental mechanisms four billion years

41
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,920
ago where these living things first arose?

42
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:07,480
Now these are all kind of extremely weighty questions, very complex systems and topics,

43
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,920
and we're going to start somewhere seemingly completely ridiculously simple.

44
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,880
But I think it's a nice illustration of some of the basic ideas.

45
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,880
We're going to play a game.

46
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,720
This game is called Billiards on a Bunimovic stadium.

47
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,680
This is a shape shown here on the left that's named after Russian mathematician, and hence

48
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,560
it kind of looks like a hockey stadium.

49
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,360
And the game is going to be simple.

50
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,360
We're going to start with one particle initially.

51
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,520
And what I'm going to do is you're going to pay attention to the kind of position space.

52
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,800
The particle is going to basically move in that position space, bounce off the walls,

53
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,160
and it never loses velocity.

54
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,920
The energy is always constant.

55
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:47,440
And we're going to keep track of its position here on the left, or on your left also, and

56
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,400
the direction here on the right.

57
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,400
So let's show what a one particle looks like, and you can see just bouncing off, and every

58
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,760
time it bounces, the direction changes.

59
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:01,400
Now we're going to play now this same game, but we're going to make 200 copies of that

60
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,880
particle.

61
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,480
Now these particles don't bounce off of each other, they don't interact, we're basically

62
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,960
making 200 copies and all superimposing them on the same graph, and we're just going to

63
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,160
watch how they behave.

64
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,240
And the main difference is we're going to put all the particles initially at the same

65
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:22,200
spot shown here, but we're going to make their directions ever so slightly different, maybe

66
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:28,800
plus or minus a degree here, and then we're going to watch how the system evolves in time.

67
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,860
So you can see the particles start kind of as a compact group, but every time they hit

68
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:37,060
a curved surface, the groups begin to spread apart, and this continues, and we're going

69
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,460
to watch this for a few minutes.

70
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:43,020
And what you can notice here, this is actually one of the most famous effects in dynamical

71
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,140
systems, known as the butterfly effect.

72
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:49,180
You may have heard this from who talks about chaos theory, where if you have this complex

73
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:53,420
system, and this doesn't seem particularly complex, but it's complex enough, and you

74
00:04:53,420 --> 00:05:00,020
start it with slightly different initial conditions, and you watch it later on in time, those trajectories

75
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,900
will eventually diverge quite dramatically.

76
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:06,460
And the famous example of this is a butterfly flapping its wings in Hong Kong might end

77
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:12,500
up weeks later with a hurricane off the coast of Florida, whereas if it didn't flap its

78
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,700
wings, that wouldn't have happened.

79
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,420
That's kind of the popular science version of this, but in general, it just means this

80
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:20,340
kind of very sensitive dependence on initial conditions.

81
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:24,420
And what you can see here is from that initial point where all the particles were in the

82
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:28,980
same spot with more or less the same direction, in other words, kind of an ordered system

83
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:34,100
and we'll define that a little bit more quantitatively later on, we go to a situation where all

84
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:41,060
the particles are now spread almost uniformly throughout the entire volume of the stadium

85
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:47,220
and almost all possible directions are uniformly exhibited.

86
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:51,140
So this is going to be crucial, but we want to kind of somehow quantify this, put this

87
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,020
into, give it a number.

88
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:57,340
So this is kind of going from an ordered to a disordered way, can we actually translate

89
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:00,420
that into like a quantity.

90
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:03,860
So to do that, we're going to add one more element to our game.

91
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,780
We're going to create basically a grid of addresses.

92
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:12,580
Think of this almost like regions on a map, you have demarcating longitude and latitude,

93
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:17,820
but here we're going to have some addresses denoting position on the left and some addresses

94
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,740
denoting direction on the right.

95
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:23,660
Now here I've just divided everything into six sections for simplicity.

96
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:26,740
I could do this into a million sections.

97
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:33,420
The same concept still applies and at each time, while we're looking at the system, we

98
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,660
can be at a particular, or the system is going to be a particular address.

99
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:41,580
So for example here, the system at the initial time is in address 1D, because it's in region

100
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:48,540
1 direction region D and at some later time it's going to be in some address which we'll

101
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:54,580
call xy, but there's always going to be some address in which the system is at all times

102
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:59,740
and in order to basically quantify this a little bit better, we're going to now, we're

103
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:03,740
considering this ensemble, this 200 copies of the system, so we're going to basically

104
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:09,300
define the fractions of that ensemble that are in particular addresses at particular

105
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,300
times.

106
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:15,180
So we're going to say the probability to be at a certain address xy at time t is basically

107
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,740
going to be the fraction of all those systems at that address.

108
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:24,380
Now this is going somewhere, it's not just mathematics for mathematics sake, because

109
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:29,260
once we have that probability, we're going to, this is the final step, we're going to

110
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,340
use it to calculate a number, right?

111
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,980
And that's, so I'm going to show, there's going to be a few equations in the talk,

112
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:38,740
I apologize, understanding it hopefully won't be based on, you know, you don't need to follow

113
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:42,380
the equations too deeply, but this equation I really wanted to show because in some ways

114
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:45,780
I'm going to argue it's one of the most beautiful equations in physics.

115
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:49,660
And so what we've done here is we've taken that probability, we've summed, we've multiplied

116
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:53,540
it by the logarithm of itself and summed over all the addresses.

117
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:57,100
We multiply it by some unimportant constant out in front and that's the thing we call

118
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,940
entropy, this mystical, important quantity in physics, that's it, that's all it is.

119
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:06,140
It's just this looking at a system, dividing it up into addresses, calculating probabilities,

120
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,300
getting a number out of it.

121
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:11,660
And what we'll show later is that as a concept this is incredibly versatile because these

122
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:16,380
addresses here are position and direction addresses, but they could be anything, in

123
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:20,020
fact they could be chemical states and we'll show examples of that later.

124
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:25,340
The originator of this equation, the first one to write it down is J.W. Gibbs.

125
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:31,220
He was, someone called Einstein called him the greatest mind in American history.

126
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:38,540
That might be, I'm not qualified to say that directly, he definitely arguably is among

127
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:42,180
the or the greatest physicists in American history.

128
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:45,860
Part of the beauty of this, of his work on thermodynamics in general in this equation

129
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,980
in particular is it has such a long afterlife.

130
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:54,580
So 50 years roughly after he wrote it down, Claude Shannon came across the same equation

131
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:58,540
in information theory and more or less laid the foundations of our modern understanding

132
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:02,180
of how information is processed in computer systems.

133
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:08,780
So this is an equation with an extremely many, many different applications, but for us it's

134
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:13,420
a number, a positive number and it's going to have a very simple kind of interpretation.

135
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:18,940
So if all of our system is in one position on the map, so one region on the map, our

136
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:22,140
entropy is zero.

137
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:28,980
As the ensemble kind of covers more and more different regions, so we're going to color

138
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:34,340
those with different shadings of orange, entropy grows.

139
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:38,300
So initially entropy was zero, here now it's spread out a little bit, so entropy has grown

140
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:45,060
to about 1.9 in this unit of K, here it's now almost uniformly spread throughout both

141
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:48,340
in position and direction space, it's reached about 3.4.

142
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:52,540
So think of it as just a measure of how much this probability spreads out.

143
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:57,660
And we're going to now watch that same movie that we saw before, that ensemble kind of

144
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:01,300
diverging because of this butterfly effect, but we're now going to keep track of that

145
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,780
number as we're watching that.

146
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:04,980
So this is what it looks like.

147
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:09,300
So it's diverging initially, probability is more or less confined in a few regions, our

148
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:15,380
entropy is small and then as time progresses entropy increases.

149
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:19,780
Now it's a bit noisy here because we only did 200 copies, so if we had done this like

150
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:24,980
a million times, a million copies we'd actually see a smooth increasing curve and as it increases

151
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:30,420
it begins to kind of saturate and almost reach a maximum, and that maximum is also going

152
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:34,180
to be important because that maximum essentially is the place where the probability is more

153
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:38,780
or less uniformly distributed both in position and direction space.

154
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:43,940
So I'm not going to wait until it completely reaches it, but this is what it looks like

155
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:46,260
after you run it for a long time.

156
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:50,340
And that maximum is then the second, like three equations in the talk, this is the second

157
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,340
equation.

158
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:56,620
Again, one of the most fundamental equations in physics, which is that maximum of entropy

159
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:03,060
that it reaches is just K times the log of W, and W all it is is just a number of addresses

160
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,060
in our map.

161
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:09,860
So we had six position addresses, six direction addresses, so altogether 36 combinations, so

162
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:13,620
it's just a log of 36, which is about 3.4.

163
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,620
That's it.

164
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:19,940
Now this equation is so important that Boltzmann or rather Boltzmann's probably immediate family

165
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:23,380
or supporters had it carved into his gravestone.

166
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:30,260
So it is literally a physics equation carved in stone, and it's probably the most famous

167
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:35,820
version of entropy that people are familiar with, but keep in mind that it only applies

168
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,740
at really long times, right?

169
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:42,940
Once the system has basically uniformly distributed itself around all of position and direction

170
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,460
space, and that's what we call equilibrium.

171
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:48,620
But what I'm going to argue throughout the rest of the talk is somehow this initial part

172
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:53,740
where entropy is rising is also incredibly important, and in some sense the Gibbs version,

173
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:59,900
which gives us the entropy throughout, is the more fundamental thing to look at.

174
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:06,780
So at this stage, we can kind of summarize what this little game has shown us by making

175
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:07,780
a law, right?

176
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:12,220
So this is our version of the second law of thermodynamics, which says that for an isolated

177
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:16,020
system, so a system that does not interact with the environment, like our little Bunimovic

178
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:22,540
stadium, billiards game, entropy increases over time until it reaches this maximum, given

179
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,940
by the Boltzmann equation, all right?

180
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:25,940
And it's a law, right?

181
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:29,540
So you should definitely, definitely believe it, you know.

182
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,220
And this is how I as an undergraduate always took it.

183
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:37,300
People brought me laws, especially if they're literally carved in stone, right?

184
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,980
You just, you know, you take it as a given.

185
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,940
This is a law of nature.

186
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,640
So is this, in fact, universally true?

187
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:47,100
So I'm going to show you next, we'll perhaps shock you.

188
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:51,100
I will violate the second law of thermodynamics right in front of your eyes.

189
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:56,340
And I'm going to do this by just a very, very small change to our game, right?

190
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:59,980
We had our Russian hockey stadium with curved edges.

191
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,620
I'm going to make them straight, all right?

192
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,220
So I'm going to look at tennis court.

193
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,180
And let's see what happens.

194
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:09,940
So here's the same game played in a rectangle, all right?

195
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:13,940
Now, you can see the group of trajectories here, which started with slightly different

196
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:18,780
initial conditions, is kind of spreading out, but definitely not as much as before.

197
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:22,060
And in particular, look at direction space on the right.

198
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,900
Direction space, you see that it's not spreading out at all.

199
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:28,580
It's only really visiting four corners of that direction graph.

200
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:31,740
Our entropy is increasing a little bit, but not so much.

201
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:35,740
And in fact, if you run this forever, it will never, ever reach the Boltzmann equation.

202
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:39,820
So that thing carved in stone is clearly not universally true.

203
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:44,380
If you keep on running this a long time, it's going to kind of look like a 1980s screensaver.

204
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,940
It's kind of mesmerizing.

205
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:50,140
But it's surely not this kind of spreading out in all of position space that we saw before,

206
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:52,260
where it almost looked like a gas, right?

207
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,940
Spreading out through a volume.

208
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,460
Here it's much more ordered, right?

209
00:13:55,460 --> 00:14:00,580
And that's clearly reflected by the fact that our entropy is much smaller, all right?

210
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:04,540
So I think we're going to need a revision on our law.

211
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:07,780
Terms and conditions may apply.

212
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:14,700
And in fact, this is actually a subtle and difficult problem because this is, well, from

213
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:19,860
the mathematician standpoint, this is enough to show that clearly this is not a universal

214
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:25,420
law, but can it be shown for any systems?

215
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:31,220
So it turns out that the only place where this law has been rigorously proven is for

216
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:35,020
these kind of simple mathematical games like billiards.

217
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:40,700
And Yakov Sinai, who was the first person to actually prove this for a billiards system,

218
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:45,540
actually won what's the equivalent of a Nobel Prize in math, the 2014 Abel Prize for this

219
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,540
proof.

220
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,540
It's ridiculously hard.

221
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,860
And that's for one particle bouncing around.

222
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,540
It becomes even more difficult.

223
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:56,140
Like, it's not even proven for a group of balls bouncing off of each other in a simple

224
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,100
two-dimensional surface.

225
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,500
So it's quite a difficult thing.

226
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,980
What do you mean by an isolated system?

227
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:06,060
So in this particular case, I mean a system that doesn't exchange energy or particles

228
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,820
with its surroundings, right?

229
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:11,060
So this is, I mean, later on we'll consider systems like biological systems where we're

230
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:14,060
clearly sitting here, you know, this room is a certain temperature.

231
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:19,860
We're constantly exchanging energy particles in the gas around us or bouncing off of us,

232
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,780
passing us and taking energy away from us.

233
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,820
So that's a more complicated scenario.

234
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:28,820
So in this particular case, I mean a system that has no exchange of energy or particles

235
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,980
or anything else with its surroundings.

236
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:35,380
For both of those shapes, does the size of the shape matter?

237
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:43,220
In other words, if the stadium was round or if it was higher and wider or in the square,

238
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:46,300
if it was higher and wider, does that have anything to do with it?

239
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:52,220
The absolute size of the shape doesn't matter except that circles are a bit different.

240
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:57,780
So it does have to have this combination of straight and curved edges, but the actual dimensions

241
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,380
of the shape don't matter too much.

242
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:04,260
It'll matter in terms of how long it may take to equilibrate, but beyond that, the second

243
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:07,060
law will hold for the curved stadium, yeah.

244
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:10,380
Be, you know, again in the shape of the arena.

245
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:15,820
For example, when you have a curved one and you've got objects ricocheting off of a curve,

246
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:21,460
they have, you know, a bigger range of direction they can travel in when you hit a straight

247
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,580
line or a flat surface.

248
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:27,460
The angle of incidence equals the angle of deflection, yeah.

249
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:31,780
So that's actually, you bring up a very interesting point because it turns out that in this particular

250
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:35,940
shape, the way the dynamics are designed, the angle of incidence always does equal the

251
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:40,380
angle of reflection, but you have to define the angle as kind of the tangent to the circle

252
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,980
when you're doing the, when you're doing the kind of curved circular part.

253
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:48,180
So it's basically the line that just touches, that just grazes the edge of the circle.

254
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,300
And then it bounces off of that line.

255
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:54,580
But what you bring up, which is actually is true, is that the behavior off curved surfaces

256
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,980
is much different than the behavior of straight lines.

257
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:00,060
And that's why in the rectangular case, you get much less divergence.

258
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:06,260
So a little extra kind of, you know, the slight mathematical difference there is enough to

259
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,180
create this divergence.

260
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,860
But it's actually a really, it's a really subtle point, and it's not something that

261
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:14,180
like you can, well, I'm gonna actually, I'm gonna say you can't generalize it, but I'm

262
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:20,380
gonna literally just do that in the next slide, but it's very difficult to prove rigorously.

263
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:23,620
And that's why it's kind of, you know, I mean, Yakov Sinai was one of these mathematicians

264
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:27,260
who sat in the back of physics lectures and looked at what the physicists were saying

265
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,100
and thought, like, this is just ridiculous.

266
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,100
They're making so many assumptions.

267
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:33,820
Let me go back to first principles and prove it, and then it took them like a career to

268
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,660
prove one simple thing.

269
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:40,460
What if the arena were shaped, say, like a hexagon or a pentagon?

270
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:44,340
I think from, I have to double check this.

271
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:48,780
I believe that any combination of straight edges would not give you chaos, but I would

272
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:49,780
have to double check that.

273
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:55,500
I haven't seen this game played in like polygons, but I think you do need to have these curved

274
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,300
surfaces for this to work.

275
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,820
Thank you for joining us.

276
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:06,220
You've been watching Professor Mike Hynchefsky introducing the basic concepts of non-equilibrium

277
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,540
thermodynamics.

278
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:12,100
For more information on the Origins Science Scholars Program, please visit the institute's

279

website at origins.case.edu.

280
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:23,020
In the next part of the talk, Professor Hynchefsky will discuss entropy and the chemistry underlying

281
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,020
life.

282
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,580
Now, back to the talk.

283
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:29,580
There is clearly something called the second law of thermodynamics, which we learn about

284
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:37,420
in textbooks and which does exist, but in some ways it's kind of a leap of faith, right?

285
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:41,420
What I want to kind of emphasize is, yes, we look at these shapes of the surfaces, but

286
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:45,420
what really was the distinguished thing was one led to this kind of chaotic dynamics which

287
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:49,580
was highly dependent on initial conditions, the other didn't.

288
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:55,140
We believe, again, this very, very rough rule of thumb that complicated systems, meaning

289
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:59,820
systems with lots and lots of particles like all of us and the universe around us, with

290
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:04,020
strong interactions where particles bouncing off, interacting with each other through fundamental

291
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:09,540
physical forces, that system taking an aggregate is indeed a chaotic system.

292
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,980
And we, of course, we know that for things like weather systems, we see chaos all the

293
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:13,980
time.

294
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:19,140
And in particular, we think the entire universe, observable universe, falls in this category.

295
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:24,540
And this is why we can talk about, at least as a kind of leap of faith, a second law for

296
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:28,340
the universe, even though we can't rigorously mathematically prove it.

297
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:32,020
Now one thing I wanted to do is an aside, and this is, again, I apologize to actual

298
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,740
cosmologists in the audience.

299
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:36,460
People love to talk about the entropy of the universe.

300
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:39,060
What actually is it and what does it look like?

301
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:44,420
So this is the best estimate that I could find, but it's going to, it looks like that.

302
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:48,740
This is based on a paper from Egan and Lineweaver published a few years ago, and I wanted to

303
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:52,140
convince you, it's a little bit different than our line, you know, entropy increasing

304
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:58,460
over time in the stadium, but still same pattern, things increase over time.

305
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,460
So this is, the time scale is a little bit different.

306
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:04,980
You can notice this is like 10 to the minus 40, 10 to the minus 21, 10 to the 20.

307
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:08,820
We're about 10 to the 17 seconds since the Big Bang.

308
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:13,660
But overall, that entropy has increased by fairly large, you know, it kind of stays constant

309
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:18,020
for a while and then has these huge increases over time, and we're right about here kind

310
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:22,940
of on this final plateau before an extrapolated value where eventually the universe will end

311
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:25,860
up in heat death and perfect equilibrium, right?

312
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,740
That's the maximum over there.

313
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,740
We're not there yet.

314
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,540
We still have time to go, happily.

315
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:34,740
Now what's really interesting about, I'm not going to talk about all the, what causes

316
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:38,220
all these individual bumps, just kind of an aside, what's really interesting is if you

317
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:44,740
have to guess what contributes the most to the entropy of the universe in the current

318
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:47,380
moment, it's actually quite interesting.

319
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,380
So here's our entropy.

320
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:53,340
So 10 to the 104 in these units of K, and these are the contributions.

321
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,660
So supermassive black holes.

322
00:20:55,660 --> 00:21:06,380
So these are the black holes that can be billions of times the mass of our sun, 99.999% a lot.

323
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,620
What else contributes to the entropy?

324
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,420
Oh, there's also smaller black holes.

325
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:13,260
Those are in there about .0001%.

326
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:17,900
And there's a bunch of other things, photons, you've got to add a bunch of zeros.

327
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:21,420
And then there's a whole list in this paper, and eventually you'll get down to ordinary

328
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:26,220
matter, including all of us in the audience here, and the rest of the stars and other

329
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,220
matter in the universe.

330
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:30,860
And that's our fraction of the total entropy.

331
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:35,460
In a weird way, and again, something that's not the topic of this course, black holes

332
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:40,460
dominate the entropy budget of the universe to a ridiculous extent.

333
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:45,300
In fact, that recent black hole that you all saw in the news, that famous, the black hole

334
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:48,540
picture, that's about 10 to the 95 K in entropy.

335
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:55,700
If you, based on its extrapolated parameters, that has 100 trillion times more entropy.

336
00:21:55,700 --> 00:22:00,860
In other words, 100 trillion times more addresses living on the surface of that black hole than

337
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:05,100
all the ordinary of the matter in the universe put together.

338
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:10,140
So one way of looking at the issue of complexity in terms of the entropy, this second law says

339
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:16,700
the entropy of the universe must always increase, is in some sense, all of us here are highly,

340
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:21,100
highly irrelevant to the overall entropy budget of the universe.

341
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,100
That cannot be said enough.

342
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:27,460
I mean, in some sense, the fact that you have these stars burning for a few billion years,

343
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:32,140
and you have some rocky planets circling those stars, and some chemical processes happening

344
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:38,420
on those planets that lead to some kind of self-aware life, I mean, that's kind of like

345
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:45,540
froth on a giant ocean, where the vast majority, the bulk of that ocean is living on the surface

346
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,500
of black holes.

347
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:52,380
So in some sense, what's happening with black holes dominates the entropy budget, and everything

348
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:56,300
else is kind of like, you know, you can't even call it a rounding error, because this

349
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:59,300
is like such a tiny, tiny fraction of it.

350
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:02,140
Now, that's not quite the end of the story, right?

351
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:05,900
Because in that sense, then we could say, well, anything goes, because, you know, at

352
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:09,740
some level, like, the fact that we have, we lower our entropy state a little bit here,

353
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:13,300
it doesn't really matter that much in terms of the universal entropy budget, but it's

354
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,620
not quite that, right?

355
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:18,660
Because in some sense, the second law doesn't just apply to the universe as a whole, it

356
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:23,500
also applies to subsystems of the universe, and that's where we pay kind of the dues

357
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,060
to the second law in everything that we do.

358
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:29,820
All right, so how does the second law play out on smaller scale?

359
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:33,620
So that was the end of our cosmology aside.

360
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:38,060
To understand this kind of, you know, its implications on our scale, let's take a look

361
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,060
at some snapshots.

362
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:42,620
So we're going to go back to our game, and now we're going to look at, let's say the

363
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,620
first 20 seconds, okay?

364
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:47,260
So we're going to look at that movie again, first 20 seconds of it, while the entropy

365
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:50,380
is increasing, let's watch, all right?

366
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:55,460
So the thing kind of diverges, and then the movie will stop, all right?

367
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:59,500
I'm going to show you a second version of that, and you can just shout out what you

368
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,500
think is going on.

369
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:07,340
So this is the second version of that.

370
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,340
It's converging.

371
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,340
What have I done?

372
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:11,180
I'm playing, okay, yes.

373
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:13,300
Obviously, it seems like I'm playing backwards.

374
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,420
The answer is no.

375
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:18,460
I'm almost doing that, and in fact, I'm getting the same result.

376
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:22,860
What I've actually done is I've started in this configuration here, that was the configuration

377
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:26,620
at 20 seconds, and all I've done is I've reversed all the velocities.

378
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:30,540
So I basically, these were the old velocities here in pink, I've now just moved them across

379
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:35,660
the other side of the circle, and just, you know, rearranged all the directions.

380
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:39,940
And when you do that, everything just converges back to the beginning.

381
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,940
It seems like it's going backwards in time, right?

382
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:47,420
To us, psychologically, that's what seems to be happening, and in fact, this is actually

383
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:50,940
true that for any physical system, you can actually reverse things, right?

384
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,900
So people have actually just a few days ago that was in the news that people have managed

385
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,380
to do this for several qubits.

386
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:58,820
They more or less were able to have qubits evolve in time for a certain amount of time,

387
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:04,580
do some complicated quantum mechanical manipulations, and those qubits, those little quantum particles,

388
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:09,020
would then evolve backwards, kind of, they called them Benjamin Button, you know, qubits.

389
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:12,860
Now, why did you think it was going backwards in time?

390
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:17,180
Because to us, you know, our experience of the world, we know that there's a certain

391
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:20,020
sequence of things that are more likely to happen versus the other.

392
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:24,500
For example, we know that little babies grow up to be teenagers, grow up to be middle-aged

393
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:28,380
people, grow up to eventually, you know, be older, and then eventually we die.

394
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,700
That's, we see that all the time.

395
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:34,740
We rarely see except in movies with Brad Pitt, you know, old people becoming infants,

396
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,100
you know, and reverting back.

397
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:41,220
Now it turns out that there's nothing inherently violating the laws of physics of having a

398
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,740
Benjamin Button.

399
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:45,100
It's just highly, highly unlikely.

400
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:49,060
And this is one of the things that we, that kind of a consequence that we're going to

401
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:53,820
try to emphasize about entropy increasing is that it means when entropy is increasing,

402
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:57,020
certain sequences of events are much more likely to happen than others.

403
00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:01,060
So for example, that sequence when the, when the balls kind of diverge and bounce and become

404
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:05,380
more disordered, that seems much more likely to you to occur than a sequence where everything

405
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,380
converges.

406
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:10,300
Even though it's possible to have all those velocities flipped and everything to go back

407
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:13,700
to its initial part, it's just really, really hard to do that.

408
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:17,780
And the more particles you have, the more statistically difficult it is to flip everything

409
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:20,460
and have everything converge back to itself, right?

410
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:25,220
So when entropy increases, there seems to be a preferred order of things, right?

411
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:28,300
And we'll make that a quantitative in a little bit.

412
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:32,760
Now I want to show you now just a contrast, a second snapshot, which is at the very end

413
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:36,200
of the simulation when we're looking near equilibrium, all right?

414
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,000
So this is going to be, I'm going to do the same game.

415
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,200
So I'm going to play it for 20 seconds like that.

416
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,520
And then, okay, it's bouncing around like a gas.

417
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,840
I'm going to do the same thing, flip all the velocities, play it again.

418
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,440
And there, if you look at it, you won't be able to tell which one, if I just showed you

419
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:56,240
without telling you the difference, there's no way you can actually even tell statistically

420
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,400
which one is going forwards, which one is going backwards.

421
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,680
In fact, every sequence of events, when we've reached our maximum, when entropy no longer

422
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,640
changes, is equally likely as any other.

423
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,000
There's no preferred direction.

424
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,320
So in a very real sense, in equilibrium, there is no arrow of time, right?

425
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:18,200
This is the famous, if you may have heard of it in discussions of this topic, but this

426
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,560
is what it boils down to, right?

427
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:23,520
We don't see that arrow of time in an equilibrium system when entropy is not increasing.

428
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,560
Okay, so let's make this a little quantitative.

429
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,200
So this is kind of, I'm going to give you a little bit of flavor of some of the ways we

430
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,960
think about entropy now, kind of a modern physics context.

431
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,880
We can actually do this, play this game in terms of addresses.

432
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,760
So we have one take, which is, we have a system that visits, you know, four addresses as

433
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,960
it's evolving in time.

434
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,480
We can ask, take two, the system visits those same addresses, but in reverse order.

435
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,040
And we can play this, you know, we can run the simulations many times.

436
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:53,120
You can ask, how often does that occur versus take, take one occur versus take two?

437
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:57,520
And we can calculate the probabilities of those, of those sequences.

438
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:01,480
If we take the ratio of them and then take the log of it, we get a number, which I'm

439
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,000
going to call sigma.

440
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,760
This sigma is actually in some ways our modern, the modern version of what Gibbs was doing.

441
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,560
We actually now interpret that as essentially being an entropy of a sequence.

442
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:15,240
So before I was talking about an entropy of an ensemble of many copies of a system, here

443
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:19,680
we're actually defining entropy at the level of a sequence of states which we visit.

444
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:23,360
And we, we interpret that as basically the amount by which the entropy of the universe

445
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,440
has increased during that visiting the forward sequence of states.

446
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,080
So if the entropy is not increasing, right, the probability of the top is the same as

447
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:35,680
the bottom, that's one, right, the ratio is one, the log of one is zero, so entropy

448
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,440
is not increased, that's consistent.

449
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,680
And if one is much, much larger, much, much smaller than the other, then entropy is either

450
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:44,240
large, very much increasing or decreasing during the sequence.

451
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,880
So let me give you a concrete example of this, Humpty Dumpty, right?

452
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,880
Everybody knows Humpty.

453
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:53,920
This is a sequence of two events, Humpty is intact, Humpty falls, breaks, and according

454
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:57,800
to the nursery rhyme, all the king's horses and all the king's men could not put Humpty

455
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,920
back together again.

456
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:05,360
But they, you know, Humpty could have spontaneously reassembled, again, not violating the laws

457
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,760
of physics, highly, highly unlikely.

458
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,400
But we can calculate the ratio, so Humpty falling, Humpty breaking versus Humpty reassembling,

459
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:17,840
that number is like 10 to the 10 to the 20, that's a very, very large number.

460
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,760
And how does that, you know, by converting it to entropy in the, in using the formula

461
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:28,240
from the previous slide, that corresponds about, about 10 to the 20 K of entropy released

462
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,240
into the universe.

463
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:34,520
So the universe has crept up that much closer towards heat death by Humpty falling.

464
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:40,960
Now here's then the crucial part for the next several, you know, slides of the talk.

465
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,960
That's fine.

466
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,560
So that's kind of, and this is, this is this law, this, this idea that I've shown you applies

467
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:48,640
just as well for Humpty's subsystems, the living things, you know, it doesn't, it's

468
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,000
a law that applies to subsystems as well as the whole universe.

469
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,720
But how does the entropy of the universe increase when Humpty falls?

470
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:00,600
And it turns out that this increase is just heat release, right?

471
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:10,000
It's about 0.2 calories, so not a huge amount of heat, but that's, oh, are we, okay, yeah.

472
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,320
So it's not a huge amount of heat release, but it's some amount of heat has been released

473
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,760
into, into the, into the surroundings.

474
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,760
And why does the universal entropy kind of increase there?

475
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,880
Because when we give energy to the surroundings, the surroundings in some ways can explore

476
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:31,280
more addresses, and hence the entropy of the universe as a whole is increasing, right?

477
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:36,280
So that's going to be kind of crucial because this is how typically we pay our due to entropy

478
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:42,480
as, you know, subsystems of the universe, we tend to release heat, dissipate heat, right?

479
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,480
Okay.

480
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:50,280
Let me give you a kind of a more down-to-earth example of this, where we are releasing heat.

481
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,520
So this is a circuit, right?

482
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,760
We attach a battery to a circuit, and, you know, a motor to that, to that circuit.

483
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,360
There's some heat being dissipated.

484
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,720
Now what's going on here, right?

485
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,280
Why doesn't there need to be heat dissipated?

486
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:08,240
Well, the electrons in that wire, if we didn't have the battery attached, would just be more

487
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,560
or less moving in random directions, right?

488
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,960
There would be no preferred direction.

489
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:16,960
So one kind of sequence of electrons motion to the left would be equally probable to another

490
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,160
sequence of electron motions to the right.

491
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:24,520
But in when we have a current flowing through the system, one of those sequences becomes

492
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,200
much more likely than the other, right?

493
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:31,160
There's a preferred direction for the electrons to move through our wire.

494
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:34,280
Based on the argument that I just showed you, because there's now this preferred sequence

495
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:39,040
of states which the system visits, the entropy of the universe must increase.

496
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,040
How does it increase?

497
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,800
Well, heat has to be dissipated, right?

498
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,960
Okay, heat is a form of energy.

499
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,600
It's being released into the environment.

500
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,600
Where does that energy come from?

501
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,520
There must be an energy source, right?

502
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,720
That's why you have to have a battery.

503
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:56,240
So in a weird way, in this kind of inverted thermodynamic perspective, I argue the existence

504
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:02,600
of the battery by the fact that first there's a symmetry breaking in the motion of the electrons.

505
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:06,840
But for me, that heat, that we take it for granted, you know, we plug things in, you

506
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:10,400
know, our electronics are all heated up, things like that.

507
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:17,080
That kind of very mundane aspect of our daily lives is, in fact, all the objects around

508
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,360
us are paying to the second law of thermodynamics.

509
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:23,280
So this heat dissipation is essentially the entropy price because those electrons are

510
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,440
moving in a preferred direction.

511
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,260
Because there's this other law of thermodynamics which I have not emphasized, called the first

512
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:34,800
law, more or less the energy conservation, the power in minus the power out is equal

513
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,120
to the power dissipated, right?

514
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:41,280
So you have to have more power in than power out in order to have dissipated heat, right?

515
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:45,400
So you have to have an energy source that's larger than the power that the motor is using.

516
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:51,080
All right, this is a much more concise way of explaining this.

517
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,640
This is stupid.

518
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,480
Don't do this.

519
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:02,480
Those electrons in that wire are not going to spontaneously begin moving around in a circle

520
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,640
because there's no power source.

521
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,240
Okay.

522
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:11,200
So now let's now switch gears a little bit.

523
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:17,040
So everything that I've talked so far have been addresses that have lived, positions

524
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:23,040
and directions, positions and directions of electrons or particles and stadium.

525
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,720
The power of this concept is that address could be anything.

526
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:29,240
It could be a chemical, it could be a step in a chemical cycle.

527
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,920
So this is one of these famous cycles that if you have memories of high school biology,

528
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:36,360
probably brings you back some nightmares of memorization.

529
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:39,960
We're not going to go through the details of these kind of metabolic cycles, but note

530
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:44,040
that whenever the people draw these cycles, always the arrows primarily in one direction.

531
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,040
Why?

532
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,280
Because that's how it happens in our bodies.

533
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:49,760
It primarily goes in one direction rather than the other.

534
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,760
What does that mean?

535
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,640
It means that we have now a sequence of states more likely to go in one direction than the

536
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,640
other.

537
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,400
Well, we've got to pay our due to the second law.

538
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,240
That means heat has to be dissipated, right?

539
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:04,120
So there's going to be some necessary entropic price to pay.

540
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:10,040
So let me give you kind of one very famous example of such a cycle.

541
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,280
So this is the ATP synthase protein.

542
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:17,720
So this is a protein that essentially synthesizes this energy molecule called ATP, which then

543
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:21,000
runs a lot of the other biological processes in our body.

544
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,800
And those biological processes degrade that energy molecule back into ATP and phosphate.

545
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,520
And this protein actually spins around.

546
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:33,360
It's kind of this interesting rotor complex, and it spins around primarily in one direction

547
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:38,640
so long as you have an imbalance of ions on one side of a membrane versus the other.

548
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:47,360
In that previous work where you were bouncing the particles around the racetrack, just as

549
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:53,880
a problem, I would ask what would happen if the racetrack was elliptical and you started

550
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,640
out at one focus of the ellipse?

551
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:00,480
I don't think there would be chaos.

552
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:07,840
I have not explored all possible shapes, but I do think if ellipses were, I would have

553
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,520
heard about it in some ways.

554
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,400
Like it requires a particular combinations of shapes.

555
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:19,760
An array of light that goes through one focus will wind up at the other focus.

556
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,720
So that would argue against the fact that things are going to become disordered inside

557
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:26,040
that ellipse.

558
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:30,200
But I think it would not become disordered in the same way.

559
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,600
I may have missed this.

560
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,600
Excuse me.

561
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:37,440
What is the actual definition of the word entropy?

562
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:43,040
So used in this talk, and I wanted to be kind of very clear so that there isn't this confusion.

563
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:50,200
The definition of entropy is this thing here in the blue box.

564
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:57,360
So you take a system, you divide it up into a state space, addresses which denote the states

565
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,360
of the system.

566
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:02,200
You have probabilities associated with being at a particular address at a certain time.

567
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:06,440
You take those probabilities, you multiply them by the logarithm, you add them all up.

568
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,440
That's entropy.

569
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,440
Could you give me a sentence?

570
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,000
A sentence, okay.

571
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,760
So the less mathematical definition would be, it would be a measure of how spread out

572
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,080
that probability is, how disordered the system is.

573
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:23,440
How disordered the problem is.

574
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,480
How spread out the probability is, which you can interpret in a way as how disordered

575
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,720
the system is.

576
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:32,580
Because the more spread out you are, the more addresses you live in, the more different

577
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:36,040
combinations are possible that you see in the system.

578
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:39,080
So when entropy is zero, everything lives at one address.

579
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:44,600
When entropy is large, everything is, all addresses are equally likely to occur.

580
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,680
And there's a roof to help for how I...

581
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,680
Exactly.

582
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,680
Right?

583
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,080
So if this was a completely empty city and all of us sitting here in the audience were

584
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:57,480
in this particular room, and let's say we divided up the city into boxes of the side

585
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,840
of this room, the entropy of our population would be zero.

586
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:05,400
But then if you guys all went out and equally like uniformly spread out throughout all of

587
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:10,880
the Cleveland area so that there was a uniform population density of you everywhere, then

588
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,200
your entropy would be maximum.

589
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:15,680
That would be the most disordered that you could become.

590
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,520
And it's different for different systems.

591
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,040
It's completely different for different systems.

592
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,040
Even in the notion of what an address is, that's why I kind of use this word address.

593
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:25,240
I mean, in physics we call it phase space, but that's more technical.

594
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:29,000
But like what I'm claiming is that this idea of addresses works just as well in chemistry

595
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,320
as it does for actual physical positions.

596
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:38,080
We hope you've been enjoying the Origin Science Scholars Program with Professor Michael Hynchewski.

597
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:43,120
Professor Hynchewski is the Warren E. Ropp assistant professor in the Department of Physics

598
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:48,400
at Case Western Reserve University, specializing in theoretical biophysics.

599
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:54,760
In the second part of our talk, we learned how life is a cascade of energy conversion

600
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,720
and dissipation.

601
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:01,800
In our final segment, Professor Hynchewski will talk about thermodynamics and the origin

602
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,800
of life.

603
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,640
Now, back to our talk.

604
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:10,520
So if you take a, you know, again, comparing or going back to this comparison with a battery,

605
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:13,020
it seems like a very, very different system, right?

606
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:16,800
So we have, but when I argue it's not that much different, right?

607
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:21,740
So on one hand we have a system that's kind of, has some preferred direction, right?

608
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:26,900
Here it's the mode, it's the proteins, you know, preferably going in one direction.

609
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,860
Here it was the electrons preferably going in one direction around the wire.

610
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:33,340
We have some process that's going on where energy is being utilized.

611
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,740
Here it's the synthesis of ATP.

612
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:38,340
Here it's the motor turning.

613
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:40,140
We have some power source.

614
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,140
Here it's a battery.

615
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:43,700
This was just such a chemical potential energy.

616
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:48,140
Here that battery is in something, the imbalance of ions on one side of the membrane versus

617
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,300
the other.

618
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:53,100
And as a necessary sort of consequence of the second law of thermodynamics, heat has to

619
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,100
be released.

620
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:57,660
There has to be some amount of loss of energy through heat.

621
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:01,380
Now if you let both of these systems run indefinitely, what would happen?

622
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,700
Well, your battery would become depleted.

623
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,100
It would go to equilibrium, right?

624
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,420
The electrons would stop moving in a preferred direction.

625
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:10,620
Here if you kept on running this thing forever, eventually this, there would be the equal

626
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:13,900
number of ions on one side of the membrane versus the other.

627
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:18,820
And now your protein would begin to have, it would still kind of move, but in random

628
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:21,020
ways and not with a preferred direction.

629
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:23,500
So basically your battery would become depleted.

630
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:27,380
So what happens in nature is, well, in our case, sometimes you switch out the batteries,

631
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:29,780
maybe it's a rechargeable battery, we can recharge it.

632
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:33,460
In nature we pump out, we pump those ions continuously back out, right?

633
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:38,460
How that pumping occurs differs from organism to organism.

634
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:43,340
And in our case, it's we ingest food and some of that energy is being converted into pumping

635
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:45,700
out those ions.

636
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,980
Let me give you one kind of very simple example.

637
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:54,860
This is from a simple bacterium where that pumping occurs because of another protein called

638
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:57,020
bacteria rhodopsin on the membrane.

639
00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:02,340
And it basically interacts with photons from sunlight and uses that energy from the photons

640
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:08,060
to basically drive its own cycle of pumping where it pumps those ions back out.

641
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:10,500
On the other side of the membrane, then you have an imbalance form.

642
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:16,460
That imbalance then is used to power this ATP synthase to basically produce the ATP,

643
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:18,540
then that drives other biological processes, right?

644
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:23,300
And this is one particular example, but in some ways everything that we know about life

645
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,780
is kind of built on kind of these nested cycles, right?

646
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:28,340
So I'm going to kind of draw it like this, right?

647
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:31,300
So you might have some fundamental energy source on top.

648
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:33,140
In this case, it was a photon.

649
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:36,300
That energy source powered a cycle which created a certain imbalance.

650
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:41,180
In this case, it was an ion gradient, so more ions on one side of the membrane to the other.

651
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:45,380
That ion gradient, that imbalance, in turn then powered a different imbalance, right?

652
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:50,180
Another cycle primarily in one direction of the ATP synthase protein, which then in turns

653
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:54,820
powers other cycles driven primarily in one direction, all of our metabolic cycles and

654
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,940
cell division, things like this.

655
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:01,940
At every step, because we are driving things primarily in one direction, so we're breaking

656
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:05,900
the symmetry, we have to pay our dues to the second law.

657
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,500
So we have to dissipate energy.

658
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:11,780
We have to, there has to be some heat release at every single step of the process.

659
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:15,500
So note that because of energy conservation, that means the energy available to all the

660
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:18,140
lower tiers becomes progressively lower and lower and lower.

661
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:20,620
We're wasting energy all throughout.

662
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:23,460
But that waste is not somehow a bad thing.

663
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:25,140
It's what makes us living, right?

664
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:27,540
Because without that waste, there wouldn't be this broken symmetry.

665
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:32,460
We wouldn't have our cycles going around primarily in one direction.

666
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:38,540
So in fact, you sitting here, all of us, are releasing about 100 watts of power, which

667
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:41,820
is the old, this is not an audience where I have to remind people of what incandescent

668
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:46,340
light bulbs are, but to my students I may have to do that.

669
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:52,660
But I mean, it's about the power of an old fashioned, now old fashioned light bulb.

670
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:58,580
So that 100 watts of power releasing into the atmosphere, that is in some sense the indicator

671
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:03,260
of all the non-equilibrium thermodynamic processes going on inside of our bodies, all the biochemical

672
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:05,860
cycles being primarily driven in one direction.

673
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:12,220
The net result of that is this 100 watts that we're releasing out into the atmosphere.

674
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:16,580
So that was one thing, one particular organism.

675
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:17,980
How does it happen for others?

676
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:21,780
Well, it turns out that from this kind of cascade, there are two parts that are really

677
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:25,660
universal to all known life that we see around us.

678
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:30,540
One is the ion gradient of some kind, the other is ATP as this energy molecule, as this

679
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:31,540
currency.

680
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:37,420
What drives the ion gradient is now, in modern living organisms, is not universal anymore.

681
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:42,660
In some cases here it was a photon, in us it's ingesting of other material.

682
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:47,260
For bacteria living near hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the ocean, might be some

683
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:52,060
chemical sources which drive this.

684
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:56,780
So that becomes that first step in the top part of the cascade is no longer universal.

685
00:42:56,780 --> 00:43:00,780
And of course, the things that we do with ATP differ from different organisms, so that's

686
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:02,780
no longer universal.

687
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:06,940
But in some sense, if we're trying to think of this as these nested chemical cycles where

688
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:13,740
one thing, one imbalance drives another, dissipating heat along the way, ultimately speaking, tracing

689
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:19,020
this evolutionary history back to the beginning of time, there had to be some fundamental original

690
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:25,980
imbalance that drove the first glimmers, the first echoes of these kind of cycles forward.

691
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:31,900
Where things were driven out of an equilibrium state to primarily go into one direction.

692
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:35,860
And on earth it turns out that if you do this kind of detective work, going forensically,

693
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:41,140
going back in time, everything that we see around us, that's interesting in some sense.

694
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:46,500
All things that are not in equilibrium, so air currents, ocean currents, plate tectonics,

695
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,180
all the chemical cycles in life.

696
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:52,700
And I'm trying to argue that mathematically we can lump all of these things together as

697
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:59,140
being different versions of the symmetry is broken, where things are going around in currents.

698
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:05,100
All of these have to be traced back to two fundamental imbalances.

699
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:11,260
And those are the fact that we're sitting next to a star which is bombarding us with

700
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:18,980
photons, beautiful source, they're transient on the scale of billions of years of energy

701
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:20,500
that can drive imbalances.

702
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:26,020
The other is geological, the fact that there's heat released as the core of the earth kind

703
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:27,020
of solidifies.

704
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:32,220
There are radioactive elements in the mantle that are decaying which provides heat.

705
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:36,420
So kind of geological and solar are really our two sources.

706
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:41,940
And unsurprisingly, there are two major camps in the origins of life field.

707
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:48,420
People who think that maybe life emerged in kind of like shallow surface lakes exposed

708
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:54,780
to sunlight, or people who think that maybe life emerged in deep ocean hydrothermal events.

709
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:58,340
Where we kind of have this clear division between these two imbalances, then of course

710
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:00,020
there could be combinations of the two.

711
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:04,700
You can have shallow surface lakes at Yellowstone or Yellowstone like things where there's some

712
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:07,660
kind of geothermal aspects to it as well.

713
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:12,620
But the field kind of breaks into two camps and can we use thermodynamics in some sense

714
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:17,620
to kind of maybe give an edge to one camp versus the other.

715
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:23,660
And again, I'm not going to say anything definitive, so this is still an ongoing question and there

716
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:27,620
are mechanisms by which both origins might work.

717
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:31,900
But this is actually, this is a kind of complicated graph, but let me walk you through it.

718
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:34,020
On the horizontal axis, think of this as energy.

719
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:39,340
And this is energy now measured here in terms of units of milli-electron volts.

720
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:43,380
It doesn't really matter what the units are, but from low to high.

721
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:47,900
And here we also see the corresponding energies of photons, where visible photons, the light

722
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:52,140
from the visible spectrum part of light is about this range of energies.

723
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:57,060
Above that is the so-called ultraviolet part of the electromagnetic spectrum.

724
00:45:57,060 --> 00:46:02,860
Here in this green range are energies typically associated with biochemical processes, like

725
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:05,420
for example ATP hydrolysis, things like this.

726
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:06,780
This is membrane potential energy.

727
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:11,100
So they live in this kind of infrared range of the spectrum.

728
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:15,900
On the bottom of this graph are ranges of energies available from certain sources.

729
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:20,140
So here in blue is water heated up to its critical temperature, beyond which it is no

730
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:21,980
longer liquid in some sense.

731
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:28,340
Here is like the energies available from like lava, like molten rock at really high temperatures.

732
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:34,220
This orange curve is the energy available from the sun, the solar spectrum.

733
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:39,660
And out here at really much higher things are basically intermittent strikes of lightning.

734
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:44,900
Now if we think about this kind of range of sources, you can say, well look, molten rock,

735
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:50,020
water temperatures, high water temperatures, they do kind of give us, get us within the

736
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:53,740
ballpark of what we see as biochemical energies.

737
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:57,660
But then if we consider now what I've tried to argue over the last few slides, the fact

738
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:01,540
that we do have to pay this due to a second law, there has to be dissipation.

739
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:06,780
So your energy input has to be larger than what you're using the energy for.

740
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:11,180
We would in principle want to gravitate to like the largest persistent source of energy

741
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:13,060
available to us.

742
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:18,380
And that's pretty much the UV part of the spectrum of photons from the sun.

743
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:23,500
Those are kind of the highest energy sources that are constantly available to us, bombarding

744
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:28,340
us all the time, and basically have the largest allowance, the largest gap between that amount

745
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:34,380
of energy and the energy that we're using for biological processes.

746
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:39,180
And this in some sense is then the thermodynamic argument for why a photon-based, a light-based

747
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:41,380
origin of life is more plausible.

748
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:43,780
Again, it's not the final word.

749
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:46,460
This is definitely not a closed book.

750
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:52,140
Also a very high energy source, but I would argue probably too intermittent unless somebody's

751
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:58,980
willing to argue that the early earth atmosphere was lightning all the time.

752
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:01,980
But photons certainly are there.

753
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:05,060
And the other part of the thing, which is actually kind of very exciting because the

754
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:09,180
field has actually really blossomed in the last two years, there is now developments

755
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:13,220
in chemistry that support this notion.

756
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:17,900
So in particular, there's been work by Jack Sostak at Harvard, and this is John Southerl

757
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:20,180
in Cambridge.

758
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:25,020
And what they were able to finally show in the last few years is a 2015 paper, is now

759
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:29,980
there is a plausible chemistry that we can associate to making the basic elements of

760
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:30,980
life.

761
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:34,780
So lipids, which are the containers, the things that make up cell membranes, amino acids,

762
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:40,180
which are the bases of our proteins, things like RNA, nucleotides for genetic material.

763
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:47,860
All of these can be synthesized under what the field considers plausible conditions similar

764
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:53,540
to early earth, and critically, the catalyst here is ultraviolet light.

765
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:59,420
So there seems to be in some ways this, again, this is a plausibility argument.

766
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:04,580
It's not a definitive thing, but we can say, UV light is then, thermodynamically speaking,

767
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:06,900
the most attractive option for an origin of life.

768
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:12,820
And now we have a plausible chemistry driven by UV light that can actually lead to the

769
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:15,220
synthesis of these types of living materials.

770
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:18,900
Again, is this the actual chemistry that occurred in earlier life?

771
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:24,820
We will probably never know that for certain, but these are different pieces of the puzzle

772
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:27,700
that we're putting together.

773
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:31,060
So we're coming towards the end of the talk.

774
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:38,060
So what I want to emphasize at the end is, again, we think of chemistry and all these

775
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:42,340
other things like hurricanes to be really two very, very different things.

776
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:45,700
What I want to argue is that they're really truly connected to each other in this deep

777
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:53,580
mathematical way through the notion of entropy, and that all these processes are all connected

778
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:56,060
through non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

779
00:49:56,060 --> 00:50:00,740
And it's kind of the line of argument that I tried to make tonight is something along

780
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:01,740
the following.

781
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:06,580
So if you see a current, if you see this symmetry breaking where a certain sequence of events

782
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:11,140
is more likely than the reverse, that necessarily implies there has to be some entropy increase

783
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:12,580
in the universe.

784
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:17,460
That entropy increase typically occurs through dissipation of heat into the environment.

785
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:20,860
OK, if heat is dissipated into the environment, what does that mean?

786
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:27,260
That means it requires a persistent power input, because you're losing energy, so that

787
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:32,820
energy has to be coming from something, and this is more or less what the kind of conceptual

788
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:34,940
framework what it boils down to.

789
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:39,860
What's interesting is this will apply just as well to exoplanets as it does to Earth.

790
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:45,420
These are universal aspects of what we understand to be laws of physics, and so any mechanism

791
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:52,740
we think of life arising anywhere else still has to obey these basic thermodynamic ideas.

792
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:58,820
And I just to kind of wrap up, this particular notion is kind of interwoven cascades of chemical

793
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:03,900
cycles where you start with like a photon on top and then, you know, dissipate energy

794
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:04,900
throughout.

795
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:09,500
I was discussing this in one of my classes, and a colleague, Robin Snyder, was a theoretical

796
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:10,500
ecologist.

797
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:14,620
She pointed out this beautiful, beautiful quote from Primo Levy, which summarizes this much,

798
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:16,700
much better and more eloquently than I could.

799
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:20,020
This is from a short story of his called Carbon, which I highly recommend.

800
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:22,140
Just go Google it and read it.

801
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:26,700
And the way he described it is like this, such as life and inserting itself, a drawing

802
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:32,180
off to its advantage, a parasitizing of the downward course of energy from its noble solar

803
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:35,180
form to the degraded one of low temperature heat.

804
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:40,900
In this downward course, which leads to equilibrium and thus death, life draws a bend and nests

805
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:41,900
in it.

806
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:46,620
And I think that beautifully kind of encapsulates in some ways the transient nature of all this,

807
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:47,620
right?

808
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:50,780
Because remember, as, you know, we're arguing here that entropy is increasing.

809
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:55,300
All of this depends on this entropy increase that can only go on for so long, right?

810
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:59,180
So all these beautiful things that we see, all these beautiful patterns, these complicated

811
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:03,660
structures, inherent in their physics is, of course, their transience and their eventual

812
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:05,160
death through equilibrium.

813
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:10,020
So in some ways, like, you know, we're, you know, it's kind of a mixed blessing.

814
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:12,700
We have all these beautiful things, but they won't last forever.

815
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:17,780
Do you see ATP in viruses, in prions?

816
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:23,980
So viruses basically are just kind of protein capsids incorporating genetic material.

817
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:27,500
So in order to actually copy themselves, they have to insert themselves into a host like

818
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:31,460
a bacterium, for example, and they use the machinery, the metabolic machinery of the

819
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:33,100
host to make the copy.

820
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:34,100
Yeah.

821
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:40,220
Well, I mean, the virus in itself just sitting there is not, you know, you know, if there's

822
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:44,340
no active biochemical cycle there, I wouldn't call that life.

823
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:47,860
Once it's inserted there, it becomes a component of active biochemical cycles, and then in

824
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:50,220
some sense, it becomes a part of a living thing.

825
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:58,060
So do you come down on the metabolism first versus, you know, a nucleic acid or a brain?

826
00:52:58,060 --> 00:52:59,060
Yes.

827
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:03,820
So part of, okay, so again, this is more kind of, you know, I'm a physicist, not a chemist,

828
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:09,460
but I think part of what this kind of work that I showed here is arguing is in some sense

829
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:13,460
the answer to the, you know, which came first, the chicken and the egg is both.

830
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:19,780
That you can have a chemistry where all the various elements that you need can arise more

831
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:24,460
or less simultaneously, and that in some sense seems the most plausible case because it's

832
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:30,420
really hard to think of, you know, containers containing nothing, you know, things that

833
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:34,620
need to be replicated like genetic material without the mechanisms, you know, the machinery

834
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:35,900
to replicate them, right?

835
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:40,540
So in some sense, you kind of would like as, you know, in something as an Occam's razor

836
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:44,500
kind of most simplest thing, that somehow these, all things more or less arose around

837
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:45,500
the same time.

838
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:48,620
Again, whether there could be more complicated mechanisms by which you have one thing existing

839
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:50,140
right before the other.

840
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:57,420
The Origins Science Scholars Lectures are presented by Case Western Reserve University's
