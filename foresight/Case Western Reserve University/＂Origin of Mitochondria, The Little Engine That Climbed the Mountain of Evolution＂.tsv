0	6260	Case Western Reserve University's Institute for the Science of Origins proudly presents
6260	9040	the Origins Science Scholars Program.
9040	14100	The Institute advances the scientific understanding and application of origins and evolution of
14100	16100	human and natural systems.
16100	19900	The Origins Science Scholars Lectures are presented with the assistance of Case Western
19900	25100	Reserve University's Segal Lifelong Learning Program, College of Arts and Sciences, and
25100	27100	Media Vision.
27100	31120	This evening, it's my pleasure to welcome Professor Joseph Lamana, the Gene M. and
31120	36480	Joseph S. Silber Professor of Brain Sciences, and Professor in the Department of Physiology
36480	37480	and Biophysics.
37480	43040	Professor Lamana is an expert on blood flow and metabolism in the brain, on the adaptation
43040	45760	to hypoxia, which is the lack of oxygen.
45760	50960	He served as president of several learned societies, and it's my pleasure to welcome
50960	55040	here tonight to talk about the origin of mitochondria.
55040	59640	Please join me in welcoming Professor Silber.
59640	66160	Today we're talking about mitochondria, and it's going to be in three parts.
66160	69480	The first is going to be about the origin of life.
69480	74600	We can't talk about the origin of mitochondria without talking about the origin of life.
74600	77280	You'll see why shortly.
77280	81720	Part two will be about the origin of mitochondria themselves, and then the three will see how
81720	88840	they had a role in the development and evolution of multicellular animals.
88840	92840	To begin with, we have to talk about the time frame.
92840	99320	This is called the biogeologic clock, and it breaks up the four plus billion years of
99320	108280	earth history into a nice circle, which shows that for most of the existence of the earth,
108280	111600	there was not multicellular animals.
111600	121880	So we have first is the period here where the earth is formed, and it's beginning to
121880	130140	cool, and within a billion years or so, we have the origin of life, the first evidence
130140	135760	that life exists there, and then for most of the existence, most of these billion years
135760	140840	after that, there's not much in the way of multicellular life.
140840	150120	So the single cell life began almost as soon as the earth was cool enough for life to occur.
150120	155720	So we're going to look at when it began, the conditions under which it began, and some
155720	161040	leading hypotheses about what generated life to begin with, and then what changed, how
161040	163280	the conditions changed.
163280	167280	Important to all of this is the consideration of energy.
167280	174240	That's the ability to generate and manipulate energy that defines life.
174240	182080	The basic ingredients for life, once the conditions cool on earth enough so that the chemicals
182080	187480	remain stable, you need energy, which can be in the form of light, heat, or chemical
187480	188560	energy.
188560	190080	You need the chemical components.
190080	194760	These are the molecules, organic molecules.
194760	198880	They had to come from somewhere, and they had to get there first.
198880	202520	And then you need water, and so that's part of the conditions on earth had to be cool
202520	209160	enough for liquid water to be available.
209160	218280	So to get right to it, we have evidence from microbial mats of life existing at about three
218280	222240	and a half billion years, pretty strong evidence.
222240	229240	We have the earliest physical evidence at about 3.7, but we also have a theoretical
229240	234760	belief or theoretical understanding that life could have occurred in hydrothermal vents
234760	237360	at about four billion years ago.
237360	243080	And this is a description of the eons of the earth showing these particular eons.
243080	249920	We have the Hadean eon named for Hades, as you might expect, because apparently the conditions
249960	256400	there are what we think of as hell, with the sulfurous volcanoes and bubbling molten magma.
256400	261000	And then you have the Archaian period, and this is the period under which life first
261000	262360	arose.
262360	267960	You have then a long period of time in the protozoic, which single cell life in the beginning
267960	274320	of multicellularity, but not much in complexity, and then the Phanerozoic, which really means
274320	279280	the obvious life period of time.
279680	285320	What we notice here, I just want to mention this, this LHB is the late heavy bombardment,
285320	291880	and that's a period of time when there were lots of meteorites hitting the planet earth,
291880	297880	and these carried with it water, and they also, I see meteorites brought water, and also
297880	305680	meteorites carried organic compounds, and we know from the meteorites that we've seen
305680	311400	recently that if we calculate how much organic materials in a meteorite, and how many meteorites
311400	318280	there were, there's plenty of possibility for carrying most organic life, organic compounds
318280	320640	to earth by meteorites.
320640	327840	And then you have the rise, right at about 3.6, 3.7, of bacterium archaea, which are
327840	335360	the prokaryotes, they are single celled organisms, and they arose under conditions without oxygen.
335360	336800	That's the most important thing.
336800	342360	The atmosphere initially contained just hydrogen and helium, that's because most of the universe
342360	349200	is hydrogen and helium, so when the earth coalesced first, that was the natural compounds
349200	350360	in the environment.
350360	356160	They're too light to stay on the earth though, earth's gravity cannot hold the light gases,
356160	361040	and so both hydrogen and helium will leave the atmosphere reasonably quickly, and the
361040	369040	atmosphere then becomes a mixture of what comes out of the volcanic vents, lots of volcanic
369040	375720	gases, mostly steam and water vapor, carbon dioxide, plenty of carbon dioxide, you have
375720	381600	sulfur and nitrogen, plus the trace gases, the noble gases that don't react so much,
381600	386880	the argon and the neon, you have a little bit of methane, a little bit of carbon monoxide
386880	390080	and hydrogen.
390080	394120	Now what we were taught in school, probably when you took biology, you were taught the
394120	402000	primordial atmosphere consisted of hydrogen, ammonia, methane, water and hydrogen sulfide,
402000	409960	which are the most reduced forms of the biological elements, nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen and sulfur,
409960	412420	or oxygen and sulfur.
412420	417800	This has to be revised a little bit because under those conditions that we now know to
417800	426280	be present, there could not be much ammonia or methane, they would have been further metabolized,
426280	433640	but so we add nitrogen instead of ammonia and we add carbon dioxide instead of methane,
433640	438760	and the UV light will be breaking down some of the water vapor into a little bit of oxygen,
438760	444840	but as soon as any oxygen will be made, it will react with minerals in the crust of the
444840	448880	earth and be pulled out of the atmosphere, and the hydrogen that was left would also
448880	456520	leave via the kinetic energy in insufficient gravity.
456520	461320	But the most important thing is that this was in a reducing atmosphere, no oxygen, or
461320	466680	less than one part per million oxygen, very low oxygen, and it seems like that's a requirement
466680	468320	for life to have a reason.
468320	474820	Now there's lots of theories on the origin of life, it's been discussed for as long
474900	481540	as people have been around, they've discussed origins, and you remember also from your biology
481540	488740	about theories of spontaneous generation and life from non-life that were discussed prior
488740	493440	to people like Pasteur who showed that this was not possible.
493440	499860	We had Darwin talk about the warm little pond which got sunlight, which had some organic
499860	503160	chemicals on which life could arise from there.
503160	510480	We had the experiments of people like Miller and Ure and Fox, which took the elements expected
510480	516760	of the primordial atmosphere, put electrical sparks in, and got organic compounds out of
516760	518240	it.
518240	526040	We also have hypotheses where these organic compounds could line up on community clay,
526040	533880	this is clay along the beach, that would act as a place for to catalyze reactions among
533880	536680	these compounds.
536680	542040	The Chile start hypothesis, which if you had the snowball earth and a frozen seas, would
542040	549360	protect the ocean from UV light and allow the chemicals to react and form life.
549360	554560	A radioactive beach hypothesis, this is radioactive chemicals along the shoreline producing the
554560	558080	heat necessary to provide the energy for this.
558080	562800	I mentioned meteorites being able to provide organic compounds.
562800	568480	More recently, they only were discovered in the 70s, some hydrothermal vents, deep sea
568480	576200	vents, when these deep sea submersibles started exploring the sea bottom, and they found these
576200	581240	areas where obvious venting was coming from the sea floor, and lo and behold, there were
581240	589320	things living there, way out of the sunlight, at 100 atmospheres of pressure, at temperatures
589320	595840	approaching 200 degrees C, and amazing, we call those extremophiles, that is organisms
595840	598400	that live in extreme environments.
598400	606360	These were suggested to people like Gunter Wachteschauser, that life might have originated
606360	613560	there, making use of the iron and sulfur minerals as catalysts.
613560	618880	The black smokers had sulfide, they were very close to the magma and very hot, the white
618880	625800	smokers a little further away, a little cooler, a little more alkaline, and there was hydrogen
625800	632080	available to get energy from, and the idea that hydrogen metabolism may have been the
632080	639000	first energy available for life to arise, and of course any or all of these might be
639000	644320	contributing, that is a multiple genesis hypothesis.
644320	654440	Now once you had life, part of the chemical process using getting energy from hydrogen
654440	661600	and methane and carbon dioxide produced oxygen as a byproduct, so this is, in a reducing
661600	668640	anoxic environment, oxygen being released as a waste product is a toxic product.
668640	680240	So as the environment gathered more and more oxygen, there would be adaptations to make
680240	684560	use of this toxic waste product in a positive way.
684920	694240	Before oxygen could accumulate, it had to react with all of the reduced iron that was
694240	695680	floating around in the oceans.
695680	704120	The oceans were filled with a soluble form of reduced iron, ferrous iron, and as the
704120	709720	oxygen came into the environment, it would react with the iron, oxidize it, and this
709720	712120	is, well, this is rust.
712120	720720	So you had to rust all of the iron in the ocean, and that iron doesn't, it's not dissolved,
720720	729040	it sinks, and so these thick bands of, red bands of rust accumulated at the floor of
729040	735640	the oceans, we call these banded iron formations, and it allows us to pinpoint fairly accurately
735640	742400	when the oxygen was produced and when the oxygen was accumulating in the environment.
742400	748080	We know, and this is a banded iron, example of a banded iron formation from the American
748080	752280	Museum of Natural History in New York, but there's an example in our Natural History
752280	755760	Museum, it used to be out front, I don't know where it is now, but it used to be right
755760	761400	out front door as you walked in every day.
761400	768680	So this indicates prodigious amounts of oxygen being generated during this three billion
768680	771920	years ago to two and a half billion years ago.
771920	776720	These banded iron formations are about two and a half billion years old in the middle
776720	784360	on average, and at the end of this period of time we come to very close to our current
784360	790120	atmosphere, which is an oxidizing atmosphere, with one-fifth of it being oxygen, most of
790120	798680	the rest being nitrogen, a little bit of carbon dioxide, and there are trace noble gases.
798680	800920	Where did that oxidizing event come from?
800920	806840	We call it the great oxidizing event, GOE, and the best guess here is the evolution
806840	815080	of cyanobacteria, so these are bacteria, single cell animals, which we used to call blue-green
815080	819840	algae when we were growing up, but they're not algae, they're bacteria, and they kind
819840	822440	of look like this.
822440	826140	This is a picture of cyanobacterium.
826140	832000	They grow in these mats, these are current mats that are available in Western Australia,
832000	839920	and those are layer upon layer of cyanobacterial mats producing oxygen.
839920	847040	These also, these cells, these single cell bacteria became the precursors of the chloroplast,
847040	851720	which is the organelle in plants that does photosynthesis and gives us oxygen today,
851720	855200	so that's the precursor of all plants.
855200	861400	What happens then, the history of oxygen on Earth winds up this way, very low amounts
861400	866920	for the first two billion years, the great oxidizing event occurs, but notice that this
866920	875080	is a log scale, this is one percent of the current atmospheric level, one percent of
875200	882760	that would be 0.2 percent of oxygen in the atmosphere, not 20 percent, so 20 percent
882760	888880	is what we have now, this is a much, still a very small amount, so for two billion years
888880	896920	oxygen was a very low level, and this is a time when mitochondria started to produce
896920	907680	multicellular animals, and we will talk about the more current time period for oxygen in
907680	914240	part three, but right now I'd like to just summarize part one here and then stop for
914240	920720	some questions, and the basic points that I've mentioned are that single cell prokaryotes
920720	927360	arise about four billion years ago in the absence of oxygen, and then cyanobacteria begin
927360	932680	to add oxygen resulting in the great oxidation event, 2.5 billion years ago as the environment
932680	935800	shifts from no oxygen to some oxygen.
935800	942240	One of the earlier slides you showed the meteorites and one of the chirality, what's the Italian
942240	943240	there?
943240	948840	Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, in the organic compounds that we use, the sugars, the amino acids, some
948840	954200	of them are asymmetric, that is they have a left handed form and a right handed form,
954200	960880	and the biology tends to use one or the other, in the carbohydrates it's mostly the D form,
960880	968240	the right hand form, and amino acids tends to be the L form, what happened, the chemically
968240	973800	they're exactly the same, so how did we get to choose one over the other, because biologically
973800	978680	you can only use one because enzymes are like a glove in a hand, you can't put a left
978680	981200	hand glove on a right hand.
981200	988280	And it turns out that in the meteorites there's a chiral preference as well, it indicates
988280	996880	that possibly we get the preference from the delivery of these compounds from space.
996880	1005440	Because you can look, they've examined meteorites for example in Antarctica, in a sterile environment,
1005440	1012720	and then they analyze them and they find that they have organic compounds.
1012720	1020400	Is it fair to say that the low oxygen level in early days was basically until the ferrous
1020400	1028720	iron got used up and became from abundant trace levels and at that point the oxygen
1028720	1038880	began, it would seem to be that for the species present to survive you had to remove oxygen
1038880	1045320	somehow, and that transition not only in the percent oxygen would be a great evolutionary
1045320	1049040	driver to things that could tolerate oxygen.
1049040	1055760	Absolutely, rise of oxygen gives you the rise of diversity and multicellularity, the iron
1055760	1061200	had to go, but also the iron reacts with, I mean sorry, the oxygen reacts with the carbon
1061200	1064840	compounds as well, it's carbonates and things like that.
1064840	1071680	So as the, and oxidations of the minerals in the rocks, these all get buried, but there's
1071680	1077000	a cycle as they rise and get weathered that gets released back into the atmosphere, so
1077000	1080680	there's a long term cycle there as well.
1080680	1089400	And later on, when the iron is gone, there still is a reaction with all the carbon because
1089400	1094640	the animals take the carbon and make carbon dioxide out of it by burning it with oxygen,
1094640	1099680	so there's a balance between oxygen utilization and plants making the oxygen.
1099680	1107000	And you had very large amounts of carbon containing organisms to allow oxygen to build up to large
1107000	1108000	levels.
1108000	1111400	If you get to the last slide or two, you'll see what I mean by that.
1111400	1112800	Thank you for joining us.
1112800	1118840	You've been watching Dr. Joe Lamana discussing the origin of life and prokaryotic cells, those
1118840	1120760	lacking at distinct nucleus.
1120760	1124920	For more information on the Origins Science Scholars Program, please visit the institute's
1124920	1129920	website at origins.case.edu.
1129920	1135480	In the next part of the talk, Dr. Lamana discusses the origin of mitochondria and of eukaryotic
1135480	1137880	cells, those with nuclei.
1137960	1140000	Now back to the talk.
1140000	1145680	This is the, this is probably, this is the heart of the talk, this is the origin of mitochondria.
1145680	1151880	Mitochondria are the cells engine that's where all cells, all eukaryote cells mean they
1151880	1153880	have a nucleus.
1153880	1157640	All multicellular organisms are eukaryotic.
1157640	1165560	All animals, all plants, all fungi are all organisms that have mitochondria.
1165560	1167840	And the mitochondria that they have are all related.
1167840	1173680	That's why we know that this event occurred only once and we all have the same related
1173680	1175080	mitochondria.
1175080	1177920	So let's move along.
1177920	1180760	All cells need energy to function.
1180760	1182560	All cells use the same organelle.
1182560	1183520	That's the mitochondria.
1183520	1189880	And the kind of the currency, the energy currency of the biology is adenosine triphosphate,
1189880	1190880	ATP.
1190880	1196040	It has a high energy phosphate on the third one and enzymes that can take that phosphate
1196040	1202560	off also get a lot of energy from it and ATP becomes ADP, diphosphate from triphosphate
1202560	1204480	and you get a lot of energy from it.
1204480	1209520	And the mitochondria takes the ADP, makes ATP for us.
1209520	1213440	And it looks something like this, kind of looks like a bacterium and that was obvious
1213440	1216640	to the people who first saw them.
1216640	1223200	It's double membrane organism, like a bacterial cell, and it's got its own genetic material
1223200	1230040	in it as well as the ability to make its own proteins, got ribosomes and the ability to
1230040	1231040	make its own proteins.
1231040	1234960	I'll talk more about how this works a little bit later in part three.
1234960	1241440	But in most typical eukaryotic cells have the nucleus, which is number two here, followed
1241440	1248280	by number five, which is a lot of the protein making machinery, this is Golgi apparatus.
1248280	1253080	But here's our friend, the mitochondrion, which is providing the energy for all the
1253080	1255720	work done by the eukaryotic cells.
1255720	1261160	And eukaryotic cells are about 10 times bigger than bacteria, because bacteria about the
1261160	1263080	same size as mitochondria.
1263080	1266680	So you get an idea of the size orientation.
1266680	1276560	They were originally seen by histologists who were, these are just barely at the edge
1276560	1280760	of visibility in a light level microscope.
1280760	1285760	And people like Altman thought they looked like bacteria.
1285760	1288840	It wasn't sure whether they were bacteria, but they looked like bacteria.
1288840	1292640	He referred to them as bioblasts.
1292640	1299840	Here they were named mitochondria from the Greek, which means thread-like granules, because
1299840	1307400	as Benda looked at it, he saw that they were connected with little bulges on them, looked
1307400	1311600	like a thread that had granules along it.
1311600	1319040	And it was known from biological dyes that they were associated with living cells.
1319040	1321360	You couldn't stain them if the cell was dead.
1321360	1325640	If the cell was alive, they took up this dye.
1325640	1331680	And because of that, it was suggested that they were involved in the oxygen respiration,
1331680	1334640	that is, the utilization of oxygen to make energy.
1334640	1341000	And it was really confirmed after World War II by a lender who wrote the classic textbook
1341000	1349920	on biochemistry that, indeed, this is the organelle that makes ATP from oxygen and substrate.
1349920	1357800	There's a whole story involved in the electron transport chain that's maybe for another time.
1357800	1367400	Now in the mid-60s, Lynn Margulis proposed that these mitochondria not only looked like
1367400	1371680	bacteria, but they must have come from, they must be bacteria.
1371680	1379600	And so she proposed the bacterial origin of mitochondria and was able to publish her
1380520	1385600	paper in the Journal of Theoretical Biology in 1967 using her married name.
1385600	1388600	She was married to Carl Sagan.
1388600	1391480	So Lynn Sagan published this.
1391480	1397600	It was rejected in 14 journals before it was published in the Journal of Theoretical Biology
1397600	1402080	because it was a crazy idea of mitochondria coming from bacteria.
1402080	1404320	But they look like bacteria.
1404320	1408880	They have the same genetic base pair distribution.
1408880	1416480	New karyotic cells have more of the AT base pair than the CG, but bacterial and mitochondrial
1416480	1421480	DNA have equal amounts of those pairs.
1421480	1423160	They have no histones.
1423160	1425080	They don't fold up.
1425080	1427800	They have a different ribosome to make protein from.
1427800	1432720	And in every case, the bacterial and the mitochondrial are identical.
1432720	1441120	So we have come to understand that Lynn Margulis was indeed correct and mitochondria started
1441120	1443320	out as bacteria.
1443320	1452280	And the idea was an archaea, a protea, it's another prokaryote, but not a bacterium, an
1452280	1453280	archaea.
1453280	1459800	It's a different domain of life, had different characteristics, engulfed a proteobacterium.
1459800	1466160	The proteobacterium was able to resist the digestive attempts of the archaea.
1466160	1468960	And then a symbiotic relationship occurred.
1468960	1475680	They had different metabolic processes that turned out to be synergistic.
1475680	1480720	This may or may not have happened quite a few times, but at least one time it worked
1480720	1484640	so well that it dominated life from then on.
1484640	1491520	So you have the generation of the first eukaryote cell.
1491520	1499560	And it required a nucleus to occur to sequester the DNA from the host cell so that it wouldn't
1499560	1503200	mix up too badly with the DNA from the bacterium.
1503200	1511000	But a lot of eukaryote DNA comes from bacterial sources.
1512000	1518920	Just on the DNA differences, a nuclear DNA made with base pairs, coils and then coils
1518920	1523360	again and then the coils coil and the coils coil again, and it's covered with histones
1523360	1529520	that keep it from just generating all kinds of mRNA until it's needed.
1529520	1537360	Whereas bacterial cells like this E. coli have these plasmids, these kind of circles of DNA
1537720	1541960	that are same as mitochondria.
1541960	1549440	Now the nuclear DNA in each cell, human cell, there's about 10 feet of DNA if you stretch
1549440	1550960	it out in each cell.
1550960	1555000	So you took all your DNA and stretched out end to end.
1555000	1559120	You could go back and forth to the moon 70 times.
1559120	1564880	That's a lot of DNA coiled up very tightly in each cell.
1564920	1570000	On the other hand, and there's only one copy per cell.
1570000	1576000	In mitochondria, mitochondria have smaller genomes, only 13 genes.
1576000	1580200	Those bacteria that became mitochondria have lost a lot of their genes.
1580200	1585600	And there's 5 to 10 copies, these plasmids, in each mitochondrian.
1585600	1589600	And there's multiple mitochondria, maybe hundreds per cell.
1589600	1598040	So there's a lot of copies of the mitochondrial genome that mitochondria can divide independently.
1598040	1605520	And the copies of the DNA can be reproduced fairly quickly compared to the nuclear DNA.
1605520	1611080	So as I say, the mitochondrial genome, it's kind of a circular plasmid type DNA, and it
1611080	1618640	has 13 to 20 genes that are the minimum required for the mitochondria to control certain of
1618640	1620920	its functions locally.
1620920	1627160	The reason it does it is that sometimes the mitochondria can be very far from the cell
1627160	1628160	nucleus.
1628160	1633640	Imagine a nerve cell where the nucleus is in the spinal cord and the axon goes all the
1633640	1636560	way down to the big toe.
1636560	1640320	That's a long distance away from the nucleus if you depend upon the nucleus to be making
1640320	1642000	the proteins you need.
1642000	1647000	And also to be able to respond to local energy demand, you need local control.
1647720	1655080	So the significance of mitochondrial DNA is we get all our mitochondria from our mothers.
1655080	1660600	The egg has the mitochondria, the sperm uses all the mitochondria it has, its energy to
1660600	1668160	get to the egg, but only one set of mitochondria are left.
1668160	1676160	And we can use that evidence to look at, by looking at rates of mitochondrial mutation,
1676160	1680200	to predict when the first human mitochondria appeared.
1680200	1687440	And that would have been in our maternal line, so we call that first human eve, and we think
1687440	1692560	maybe it was 170,000 years ago, although there's a lot of speculation, there's a lot of work
1692560	1694240	that goes into this.
1694240	1697280	It's not a done story by any means.
1697280	1701560	And also mitochondria help control what we call apoptosis.
1701560	1706040	This is a Greek word that refers to things like where the leaves fall off the trees in
1706040	1707040	the autumn.
1707040	1714400	It's a programmed cell death, or it's like a cell suicide, and this is triggered when
1714400	1721080	the energy capacity or the energy system, the mitochondria, gets so damaged that they
1721080	1726320	can no longer provide energy for the cell, then they trigger the death of the cell so
1726320	1731680	that it can be phagocytized and doesn't gum up the work, so to speak.
1731680	1737680	And it's also very important to study the mitochondrial DNA as we get towards understanding
1737680	1740920	mitochondrial aging.
1740920	1746840	And Nick Lane, who is a good scientist and also a good writer, this is an interesting
1746840	1752440	book on the subject, if you're interested, called Power Sex and Suicide, and it's all
1752440	1754360	about mitochondria.
1754360	1763680	And he's pointing out that the fact that life occurred almost immediately when it was
1763680	1769400	available in its single cell form was not that remarkable, but multicellularity depended
1769400	1776760	upon a unique event, and that is a synergistic endosymbiosis to have it occurred.
1776760	1781880	Once it occurred, it only happened that once, while mitochondria are related.
1781880	1785400	We think it comes from purple bacteria.
1785400	1794320	These have a chlorophyll-like substance, they have different colors in them, they can't
1794320	1800240	live with oxygen, they use sulfur for their energy system.
1800240	1805560	And the other side of it is the archaea, these are what would be called the pioneer
1805560	1809600	organism in the iron sulfur world theory.
1809600	1814520	These are methane, these are methanogens, meaning they make methane, they get their
1814520	1821080	energy from CO2 and hydrogen, but the problem is hydrogen is scarce, so finding sources
1821080	1826160	of hydrogen is crucial for these cells.
1826160	1830280	They're not bacteria and they're not eukaryotes, they have a different cell membrane, it's
1830280	1836760	polysaccharitic, and they can go anywhere because they make their own energy from light
1836760	1839360	or from chemical processes.
1839560	1845640	These are some of the places where they occur.
1845640	1853280	These are the black smokers, they're black because they have sulfur compounds, they exist
1853280	1859680	near magma in the deep ocean trenches, this is where the continents are pulling apart,
1859680	1866680	the plates are moving apart, magma heats the water, spews all kinds of minerals here, it's
1866680	1872480	very rich in minerals, there's no oxygen but there's plenty of other sources of chemical
1872480	1876080	energy and of course you have thermal energy.
1876080	1882760	And if you look at the one on the right, there's tube worms and what are called squat
1882760	1889920	lobsters, I don't know, but these are deep sea vents located maybe at two and three kilometers
1890000	1897000	depth, so a hundred atmospheres pressure where the water maybe four or five hundred
1897000	1903400	degrees in the case of the black smoker, it's still liquid because of the pressure, and
1903400	1911240	it's a very acidic environment, that was for the black smokers, I just said most of this.
1911240	1917280	The first one was discovered in 1977 as these underwater submarines started looking at mapping
1917280	1926720	the seabed as a source of the iron and nickel, the reduced forms and chemosynthetic bacteria
1926720	1938320	live in these, this one didn't come up, there it is, the white smoker, these were discovered
1938320	1943240	only in 2000, these are a little further away from the trench so the water is cooler, these
1943240	1948880	are steam that's bubbling up through the rock, instead of big holes they're from little
1948880	1955400	porous labyrinthine tubes which produce lots of surface area for chemical reactions to
1955400	1969560	occur and they're more alkaline than acidic and it's thought that these, the life that's
1969600	1976040	here represents some of the organisms that we're familiar with, lots of barium, calcium,
1976040	1987520	silicon, they make serpentinite, this is a compound of iron and magnesium and barium
1987520	1995320	and calcium that has green, looks like green snakes running through it, today you can find
1995360	2001960	these type of archaea in places like Yellowstone National Park, Yellowstone National Park,
2001960	2011840	this is one of the geysers, it's a hot spring and it shows the steam coming out of the center
2011840	2021600	of it here, yeah, but all along the side this color, the orange color is coming from the algae,
2021960	2027800	the bacteria and the archaea and these are like, again like the purple bacteria, these are
2027800	2033280	carotenoids and bacterial chlorophylls and the colors change with the temperature and the
2033280	2039400	seasons and so sometimes they're more purple or green and sometimes more orange depends on the
2039720	2052120	conditions, very very colorful, so basically in part two what we have is we have the event
2052120	2061760	that occurred, we have the last eukaryotic common ancestor that is the eukaryote cell that joined
2061920	2072320	an archaea with a proteobacterium that became the precursor cell of all eukaryotes going towards
2072320	2080440	the future and all these, there are three domains of life, the bacterial domain, the archaean domain
2080440	2091080	and the eukaryote domain and the eukaryote domain produces plants, animals, fungi and all life
2091200	2099640	from eukaryote domain has mitochondria that allows them to take advantage of the changes in the
2099640	2108200	environment that we're occurring and to grow into multicellular organisms and animals, so I would
2108200	2118680	stop here and take some questions about mitochondrial origins. What has to happen to the bacteria? One
2118760	2127800	thing it has to be able to resist being digested is food by the archaean engulfer and then it has to
2128680	2135240	keep from poisoning the genes of the archaean, remember the archaean engulfer doesn't have a
2135240	2140760	nucleus and so its genes are floating around and now when the bacterial releases their genes they
2140760	2146520	get mixed up and most of the time that's going to be disastrous and so a lot of those engulfments
2146520	2153880	that would normally have occurred are going to be worthless, damaging rather than productive, so it
2153880	2161080	had to be a very tricky event that occurred that allowed the bacteria to first survive and then
2161080	2167800	figure out how to keep its DNA from getting too mixed up with the other cells DNA. Have scientists
2167800	2179320	now been able to do this in a laboratory setting put an archaean and a proteal bacteria together?
2179320	2186680	Actually that has been seen in nature and in the lab they haven't made mitochondria but there are
2186680	2196760	examples of symbiotic endosymbiotic organisms existing today. Could you make a comment about
2196760	2203800	the variation in the structure of mitochondria of one species compared to another and this refers
2203800	2212760	again to this question of mitochondrial eave you know and whether you know you can have a continuous
2212760	2219240	feed of mitochondria from other species into another. Mitochondria are more similar than they are
2219240	2227000	different. The genes that encode the local proteins and also a lot of the proteins that come from the
2227000	2237720	nucleus those genes can vary but the proteins that they're producing are identical so almost all
2237720	2246600	mitochondria are just mitochondria. Now there's local changes that can change them to a certain
2246600	2250840	extent but they have about the they all have the cytochrome chain the electron transport chain
2250840	2256120	they have about the same density of energy production the same sizes they're they're more
2256120	2261400	similar than than people are similar to each other mitochondria from all different organisms.
2262360	2269080	By looking at the ultra structure picture of a mitochondrian you couldn't tell where it came
2270040	2277480	when they do investigation like for my sister's a brother we share the same mitochondria right
2278680	2282200	you got from your mother yes from my mother right so
2286280	2291800	when you go back to eave right and we go back to all these various things that the
2292520	2299000	you know anthropologists find at the natural history museum those those humans do they have
2299000	2305720	the same mitochondria or that hundred and seventy thousand year thing is set in stone and you cannot
2305720	2311160	so every once in a while there would be a mutation that would change one of the base pairs
2312600	2317080	and might not affect the protein too much it might be in a non-coding area just like in the
2317160	2324840	nuclear uh uh genome so you can watch that you you can look at that going backwards you get the
2325800	2332360	types uh and and you could follow the changes in in the populations of mitochondria going back
2332360	2338120	you could see how often the change occurs and then you could predict how far back the first one had
2338120	2345400	to be uh for this particular lineage. We hope you've been enjoying the origin science scholars
2345400	2351720	program with Dr. Joe Lamana. Dr. Lamana is a Janet M and Joseph S Silver Professor for the
2351720	2357800	study of brain sciences at Case Western Reserve University. In the second part of our talk we
2357800	2363400	learned how early bacteria were taken up by prokaryotic cells and eventually became the cellular
2363400	2370200	powerhouses we know as mitochondria. In our final segment Dr. Lamana will discuss the role of oxygen
2370200	2377240	and mitochondria in the evolution of multicellular organisms. Now back to our talk. All right let's move
2377240	2384280	to uh part three then and uh this involves uh it's a little jumpy here it's got the role of
2384280	2390920	mitochondria so we got some examples of how mitochondria participate and the role of oxygen
2390920	2400040	as the mitochondrial partner in in evolution and in extreme examples of energy consumption.
2400760	2407720	So here's our mitochondrion again and the what we're going to talk about is to show
2408760	2414920	how the mitochondrion can go about generating energy in a in a very
2415720	2423320	uh uh outline form that I think it will make it uh understandable. Basically what the mitochondrion
2423320	2431960	does is it takes the hydrogen that we get from eating food and it burns it with oxygen that we
2431960	2437080	get from breathing it in from the atmosphere and when you burn the hydrogen with the oxygen
2437080	2443240	you get a tremendous amount of energy from that uh and that energy then gets transferred into
2443240	2450200	ATP molecules that the cells can then use to do the work of the cell. So the first step is getting
2450200	2458840	the hydrogen that's done through uh the uh tca tricarboxylic acid cycle that was this that was
2458840	2464600	worked out by Hans Krebs, Sir Hans Krebs in Oxford and sometimes called the Krebs cycle
2465240	2471400	and I'm showing Sir Hans in a in a standard biochemistry joke of Hans Krebs riding a cycle
2471400	2478760	so it could be Hans Krebs cycle uh it's required of all biochemists I think to make that joke
2479720	2487720	but basically the hydrogen from sugar comes in it's converted through this cycle of compounds
2487720	2494360	and enzymes and the hydrogen is transferred to the mitochondrion and this is where the
2494360	2499880	carbon dioxide comes from so in changing getting the hydrogen from the food the carbon dioxide
2499880	2504840	is pulled off the molecules so we breathe out the carbon dioxide and the hydrogen is passed
2504840	2510680	on to the mitochondrion and then here's where the magic occurs we have a number of compartments
2510680	2518520	in the mitochondrion so let me spend just a few minutes with this diagram it's a it's two membranes
2519160	2525880	two membranes an outer membrane that's here number two is the outer membrane and an inner membrane
2525880	2533560	and that means that there's then two spaces that are important there's the intermembrane space
2533560	2538360	between the inner and outer membrane and then there's the space that is completely
2539240	2544440	surrounded by the inner membrane we call this the matrix and it's in the matrix that the
2544440	2551080	Krebs cycle is working to make the hydrogen available and that the cytochrome chain which is
2551080	2557320	a number of these proteins lined up one after another the job that they do is to separate
2557320	2564120	the electron from the proton because hydrogen is a proton and electron and so the hydrogen
2564920	2570600	proton goes out into the intermembrane space and the electron goes passed on to the next
2570600	2576760	member of the cytochrome chain at the end of that chain is a molecule called cytochrome oxidase
2576840	2581400	it looks very similar to hemoglobin it has a pocket that oxygen can bind to
2582040	2588440	and the oxygen binds in that pocket of the cytochrome oxidase the electrons come streaming down and
2588440	2596920	when four reach it it turns the oxygen into water it reduces the oxygen to water and so
2597480	2602440	as you have oxygen there it pulls the electrons through and as it pulls the electrons through
2602440	2607480	the hydrogen is pumped out what good is that well because you have now a big difference between
2607480	2613960	the amount of hydrogen in the intermembrane space and almost none in the matrix that hydrogen
2614680	2621400	creates a concentration gradient and it comes pouring in through this very specialized pour
2622360	2629400	which is an ATP synthase and as it comes down the energy in that gradient is used to make ATP
2629400	2638520	from ADP and that's magic this is in reality each mitochondrion acts as a hydrogen fuel cell
2638520	2643880	if you're familiar with hydrogen batteries and you know how much energy you can get out of it
2643880	2649960	you can run a tesla from hydrogen batteries essentially right so this is the same idea
2649960	2656920	that is hydrogen is separated into electrons that flow through the electric circuit
2657640	2664120	and then the protons are used to or the electrons as they flow through are you are drawn away
2664120	2670120	by the oxygen to make water and you have your fuel cell your battery your hydrogen battery
2671640	2681400	okay so what's the advantage suppose you just burn sugar in the case of without oxygen so no
2681400	2689000	oxygen this is just sugar being used to make some energy you get two ATP for an amount of sugar
2689000	2697320	say and if you're a bacterium or a penicillin mold or something like that you could do just
2697320	2705160	about what a mold can do not much although they do a good job on that bread lactic acid is the
2705160	2711480	endpoint and this is you know if you exercise strongly you get into an oxygen debt and you
2711480	2718440	build up lactic acid well you know that that you can't keep running you need to stop and get oxygen
2718440	2728040	to replace the energy the burning the sugar with oxygen gives you almost 20 times as much
2728040	2736280	ATP as you get from running it without oxygen it's a huge energy advantage 20 times the amount of
2736280	2745240	energy and this allows the cell to do a lot more than a prokaryote can do without the oxygen burning
2745240	2751960	ability i have that little marshmallow in there just to remind me to give you an example of the
2751960	2757000	amount of energy and sugar when you burn it if you've you've you've burned your marshmallows over
2757000	2762040	your campfires it catches fire and it burns pretty well there's a lot of energy and sugar when you
2762040	2768760	burn it with a with oxygen of course the cell takes it in small pieces and turns that into ATP rather
2768760	2778120	than let it burn like that and nature takes the mitochondria and it puts it where it needs to be
2778200	2784920	inside the cell this is another example of of how a the different cells
2785880	2792360	evolve their different structures in order to do the function that they're required and provide
2792360	2798120	the energy to do that function so this is a mitochondrion that sits inside a muscle cell
2798120	2805720	those striations and top and bottom are the are the muscle fibers that are going to use the energy
2805720	2811880	produced by the mitochondrion and each mitochondrion essentially produces the same pretty much the
2811880	2818360	same amount of energy it has about the same components so you if you look at the volume of
2818360	2824280	mitochondria you can get a pretty good idea of the ability of the cell to generate you know how
2824280	2832440	much energy you can generate and i have a couple of examples here that i think are pretty impressive
2833400	2841080	on the left you have a muscle from a mako shark and it's these are muscle fibers that are cut in
2841080	2846200	cross-section they're going in and out of the board and right next to each one of them are these
2847240	2853960	mitochondria so these are mitochondria these the muscle cell this is the mitochondria very close
2855000	2860600	and a lot of volume so you have essentially looks like pretty much the similar amount of volume in
2860600	2865800	mitochondria producing the energy as you have in the muscle cells that are producing the work
2866600	2872760	this might be similar to thinking about an electric car that has half the weight of it is batteries
2874280	2880760	in order to do what it has to do the other and so this is a shark muscle so it's a cartilaginous fish
2881560	2887720	but on the other side we have a mammalian tissue it's a heart muscle cardiac muscle
2887720	2894280	happens to be from a mouse but it's pretty much similar here these are the the lines of the muscle
2894280	2899480	so those are the ones that are pulling apart and going together and these are all mitochondria
2900280	2906520	sit in the middle of these fibers of the heart this is the nucleus of the heart muscle here's
2906520	2913240	a pile of mitochondria cardiac muscle about 40 percent of the volume is mitochondria that's about
2913800	2918120	and there's a maybe half of it or a little more maybe is the is the striated muscle
2918120	2925640	but the ratio is is pretty pretty good in brain tissue for example that ratio is about 10 percent
2925640	2931560	of that volume is mitochondrial so it shows you the difference in the energy requirements
2932120	2938600	brain versus heart now this is probably my my favorite one this is a hummingbird flight muscle
2938680	2946920	hummingbird that beats 300 times a second and can stop and hover in the air and these uh this is
2946920	2953640	really impressive these are capillaries and here's the mitochondria between the capillaries
2953640	2959080	is a nucleus of a cell and there's the muscle cells here you have more mitochondria than you have
2959080	2965560	muscle that makes sense if you think about it right and here's a close-up on the capillary
2965880	2972280	it's a cell in the middle of that capillary and it's filled surrounded by mitochondria
2973080	2979160	here's what's using oxygen what's producing the ATP here's the muscle thin strand of muscle
2980360	2988040	completely surrounded by uh mitochondria so it's it's pretty impressive and you can understand how
2988920	2994200	the hummingbird can accomplish what it does how the shark can accomplish what it was how the heart
2994200	2998840	can accomplish what it has to do for for that length of time that you that you needed to work
3000920	3005960	all right so let's go move on a little bit now and talk about the multicellular organisms
3006520	3010520	in a way it's a little backward but what I did is I showed you what the capabilities
3010520	3016840	of the system is once you can provide the energy and here's how it impacts things like
3017160	3024680	uh uh uh evolution if you're an organism and you're working at the substrate level
3024680	3031160	that's making lactate say without having the advantage of making oxygen your energy providing
3031160	3041400	system is uh only about 10 efficient it's not much 10 that means if you had a predator come along
3041400	3048360	and want to take advantage of the energy that you have and it grabs you and it's 10 efficient now
3048360	3056360	it becomes 1 percent 10 percent of 10 percent is 1 percent and that's not a that's not a good deal
3056360	3061240	it costs more to do the engulfing and the digesting than you get out of it so there's
3061240	3068360	very little predation at the level of single cell organisms that are prokaryotic but with
3068360	3074600	oxidative phosphorylation that allows you to use oxygen to generate energy you're around 40 percent
3074600	3081160	efficient now the first person in the chain gets grabbed by the next person it's 40 percent of 40
3081160	3086840	percent and then 40 percent 40 percent 40 percent and you could develop a chain at least six
3087960	3096760	layers deep before you run below one percent of the energy supply left that means that predators
3096760	3104680	now have an advantage can gain an advantage in their competition with other organisms and
3105640	3113160	the bigger the cell then the better the predator so predation tends to produce larger and larger
3113160	3119560	cells or organisms and prey doesn't sit around waiting to be preyed on it does the same
3120120	3129400	strategy and starts getting bigger for protection so when once you have this efficiency in the chain
3130200	3137880	then you have the ability to really stimulate growth and diversity and development
3138920	3145000	so why didn't bacteria get larger they had two billion years before the event that made
3145080	3151880	mitochondria and that's because the way prokaryotes work their energy producing system
3151880	3156360	those that prokaryot bacterial cell that went to become the mitochondria
3156360	3161960	was still making energy based upon its own surface area and if it got bigger its energy
3161960	3167080	requirements would grow with the volume by the cube but its ability to make energy would only grow
3167080	3172840	by the square root of the surface area that's not a good strategy but once you put the
3172840	3179720	mitochondria inside the cell you can add mitochondria you really could add them and then
3179720	3185480	your energy production capacity will grow with the volume of the cell but your utilization for
3185480	3192600	most cells can be or is related to the surface area that's a much more favorable relationship
3193640	3199960	so bacteria we're not going to be able to get anywhere with a 10 percent energy efficiency
3200520	3206600	and they couldn't grow larger anyway because of surface volume considerations
3208200	3215240	and bacteria are very successful in their niche but it's a simple solution and it's not going to
3215240	3221960	get complex they work very well and the successful bacteria are the ones that can divide fastest
3221960	3228280	and that means you can't have a lot of genes because that takes time to reproduce your genes
3228280	3234280	so the smaller the number of genes you have the faster you can reproduce and the more successful
3234280	3243560	you are so the prokaryote philosophy the prokaryote strategy keeps the cells simple and small
3244120	3249720	and successful but simple and small until you've got mitochondria you can't get complexity
3251480	3256840	now let's look at the more modern part of the oxygen curve in the last minute or so
3258840	3264040	and this represents oxygen variations that we know closer to our own time
3264040	3269640	this is half a half a billion years this is from essentially the Cambrian explosion of life
3269640	3275800	on to present day and if you plot in the yellow curve there oxygen levels you see it's not constant
3276760	3283880	it varies up and down and what we now know from this up and down is that the rates of evolutionary
3283880	3291240	diversity and the die off in the extinctions are related in a great measure to the oxygen
3291960	3298440	history so that at times when oxygen is rising you have increase in diversity taking advantage of
3298440	3304520	the everything that oxygen can give you in terms of energy from the mitochondria but when oxygen
3304520	3311160	becomes limiting then the inefficient forms die off there's one particular there's a lot of information
3311160	3316920	here but i want to focus on this one here this peak this is when oxygen reached about 35 percent
3316920	3324120	in the atmosphere remember today it's 21 percent there was 35 percent that's as much it's a maximum
3324120	3330040	because any more than that and the the forest would burn and you wouldn't be producing more oxygen
3330040	3335560	so there's a limit and that's it right oh okay so
3339400	3345160	at that time you had a higher density in the atmosphere because that was all extra oxygen
3345160	3353320	and you allowed the gigantic insects and flying insects and that the only thing i had left to try
3353320	3359000	to get through is just to give you some idea of what the human body does and we produce about 85
3359000	3368840	watts of energy about a good strong light bulb and we use about the 150 balloons worth of air
3368840	3376280	per day and we produce a half liter of water from metabolism every day and the mitochondria in our
3376280	3385000	body make essentially a hundred pounds of ATP every day by cycling ADP that's about half the
3385000	3392200	body's weight of ATP cycling and that's that's the strength of the mitochondria and with that i will
3393320	3396920	let's just summarize what we said and i'll say thanks and ask for final questions
