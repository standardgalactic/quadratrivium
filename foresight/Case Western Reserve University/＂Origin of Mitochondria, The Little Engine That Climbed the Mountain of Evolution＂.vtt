00:00.000 --> 00:06.260
Case Western Reserve University's Institute for the Science of Origins proudly presents

00:06.260 --> 00:09.040
the Origins Science Scholars Program.

00:09.040 --> 00:14.100
The Institute advances the scientific understanding and application of origins and evolution of

00:14.100 --> 00:16.100
human and natural systems.

00:16.100 --> 00:19.900
The Origins Science Scholars Lectures are presented with the assistance of Case Western

00:19.900 --> 00:25.100
Reserve University's Segal Lifelong Learning Program, College of Arts and Sciences, and

00:25.100 --> 00:27.100
Media Vision.

00:27.100 --> 00:31.120
This evening, it's my pleasure to welcome Professor Joseph Lamana, the Gene M. and

00:31.120 --> 00:36.480
Joseph S. Silber Professor of Brain Sciences, and Professor in the Department of Physiology

00:36.480 --> 00:37.480
and Biophysics.

00:37.480 --> 00:43.040
Professor Lamana is an expert on blood flow and metabolism in the brain, on the adaptation

00:43.040 --> 00:45.760
to hypoxia, which is the lack of oxygen.

00:45.760 --> 00:50.960
He served as president of several learned societies, and it's my pleasure to welcome

00:50.960 --> 00:55.040
here tonight to talk about the origin of mitochondria.

00:55.040 --> 00:59.640
Please join me in welcoming Professor Silber.

00:59.640 --> 01:06.160
Today we're talking about mitochondria, and it's going to be in three parts.

01:06.160 --> 01:09.480
The first is going to be about the origin of life.

01:09.480 --> 01:14.600
We can't talk about the origin of mitochondria without talking about the origin of life.

01:14.600 --> 01:17.280
You'll see why shortly.

01:17.280 --> 01:21.720
Part two will be about the origin of mitochondria themselves, and then the three will see how

01:21.720 --> 01:28.840
they had a role in the development and evolution of multicellular animals.

01:28.840 --> 01:32.840
To begin with, we have to talk about the time frame.

01:32.840 --> 01:39.320
This is called the biogeologic clock, and it breaks up the four plus billion years of

01:39.320 --> 01:48.280
earth history into a nice circle, which shows that for most of the existence of the earth,

01:48.280 --> 01:51.600
there was not multicellular animals.

01:51.600 --> 02:01.880
So we have first is the period here where the earth is formed, and it's beginning to

02:01.880 --> 02:10.140
cool, and within a billion years or so, we have the origin of life, the first evidence

02:10.140 --> 02:15.760
that life exists there, and then for most of the existence, most of these billion years

02:15.760 --> 02:20.840
after that, there's not much in the way of multicellular life.

02:20.840 --> 02:30.120
So the single cell life began almost as soon as the earth was cool enough for life to occur.

02:30.120 --> 02:35.720
So we're going to look at when it began, the conditions under which it began, and some

02:35.720 --> 02:41.040
leading hypotheses about what generated life to begin with, and then what changed, how

02:41.040 --> 02:43.280
the conditions changed.

02:43.280 --> 02:47.280
Important to all of this is the consideration of energy.

02:47.280 --> 02:54.240
That's the ability to generate and manipulate energy that defines life.

02:54.240 --> 03:02.080
The basic ingredients for life, once the conditions cool on earth enough so that the chemicals

03:02.080 --> 03:07.480
remain stable, you need energy, which can be in the form of light, heat, or chemical

03:07.480 --> 03:08.560
energy.

03:08.560 --> 03:10.080
You need the chemical components.

03:10.080 --> 03:14.760
These are the molecules, organic molecules.

03:14.760 --> 03:18.880
They had to come from somewhere, and they had to get there first.

03:18.880 --> 03:22.520
And then you need water, and so that's part of the conditions on earth had to be cool

03:22.520 --> 03:29.160
enough for liquid water to be available.

03:29.160 --> 03:38.280
So to get right to it, we have evidence from microbial mats of life existing at about three

03:38.280 --> 03:42.240
and a half billion years, pretty strong evidence.

03:42.240 --> 03:49.240
We have the earliest physical evidence at about 3.7, but we also have a theoretical

03:49.240 --> 03:54.760
belief or theoretical understanding that life could have occurred in hydrothermal vents

03:54.760 --> 03:57.360
at about four billion years ago.

03:57.360 --> 04:03.080
And this is a description of the eons of the earth showing these particular eons.

04:03.080 --> 04:09.920
We have the Hadean eon named for Hades, as you might expect, because apparently the conditions

04:09.960 --> 04:16.400
there are what we think of as hell, with the sulfurous volcanoes and bubbling molten magma.

04:16.400 --> 04:21.000
And then you have the Archaian period, and this is the period under which life first

04:21.000 --> 04:22.360
arose.

04:22.360 --> 04:27.960
You have then a long period of time in the protozoic, which single cell life in the beginning

04:27.960 --> 04:34.320
of multicellularity, but not much in complexity, and then the Phanerozoic, which really means

04:34.320 --> 04:39.280
the obvious life period of time.

04:39.680 --> 04:45.320
What we notice here, I just want to mention this, this LHB is the late heavy bombardment,

04:45.320 --> 04:51.880
and that's a period of time when there were lots of meteorites hitting the planet earth,

04:51.880 --> 04:57.880
and these carried with it water, and they also, I see meteorites brought water, and also

04:57.880 --> 05:05.680
meteorites carried organic compounds, and we know from the meteorites that we've seen

05:05.680 --> 05:11.400
recently that if we calculate how much organic materials in a meteorite, and how many meteorites

05:11.400 --> 05:18.280
there were, there's plenty of possibility for carrying most organic life, organic compounds

05:18.280 --> 05:20.640
to earth by meteorites.

05:20.640 --> 05:27.840
And then you have the rise, right at about 3.6, 3.7, of bacterium archaea, which are

05:27.840 --> 05:35.360
the prokaryotes, they are single celled organisms, and they arose under conditions without oxygen.

05:35.360 --> 05:36.800
That's the most important thing.

05:36.800 --> 05:42.360
The atmosphere initially contained just hydrogen and helium, that's because most of the universe

05:42.360 --> 05:49.200
is hydrogen and helium, so when the earth coalesced first, that was the natural compounds

05:49.200 --> 05:50.360
in the environment.

05:50.360 --> 05:56.160
They're too light to stay on the earth though, earth's gravity cannot hold the light gases,

05:56.160 --> 06:01.040
and so both hydrogen and helium will leave the atmosphere reasonably quickly, and the

06:01.040 --> 06:09.040
atmosphere then becomes a mixture of what comes out of the volcanic vents, lots of volcanic

06:09.040 --> 06:15.720
gases, mostly steam and water vapor, carbon dioxide, plenty of carbon dioxide, you have

06:15.720 --> 06:21.600
sulfur and nitrogen, plus the trace gases, the noble gases that don't react so much,

06:21.600 --> 06:26.880
the argon and the neon, you have a little bit of methane, a little bit of carbon monoxide

06:26.880 --> 06:30.080
and hydrogen.

06:30.080 --> 06:34.120
Now what we were taught in school, probably when you took biology, you were taught the

06:34.120 --> 06:42.000
primordial atmosphere consisted of hydrogen, ammonia, methane, water and hydrogen sulfide,

06:42.000 --> 06:49.960
which are the most reduced forms of the biological elements, nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen and sulfur,

06:49.960 --> 06:52.420
or oxygen and sulfur.

06:52.420 --> 06:57.800
This has to be revised a little bit because under those conditions that we now know to

06:57.800 --> 07:06.280
be present, there could not be much ammonia or methane, they would have been further metabolized,

07:06.280 --> 07:13.640
but so we add nitrogen instead of ammonia and we add carbon dioxide instead of methane,

07:13.640 --> 07:18.760
and the UV light will be breaking down some of the water vapor into a little bit of oxygen,

07:18.760 --> 07:24.840
but as soon as any oxygen will be made, it will react with minerals in the crust of the

07:24.840 --> 07:28.880
earth and be pulled out of the atmosphere, and the hydrogen that was left would also

07:28.880 --> 07:36.520
leave via the kinetic energy in insufficient gravity.

07:36.520 --> 07:41.320
But the most important thing is that this was in a reducing atmosphere, no oxygen, or

07:41.320 --> 07:46.680
less than one part per million oxygen, very low oxygen, and it seems like that's a requirement

07:46.680 --> 07:48.320
for life to have a reason.

07:48.320 --> 07:54.820
Now there's lots of theories on the origin of life, it's been discussed for as long

07:54.900 --> 08:01.540
as people have been around, they've discussed origins, and you remember also from your biology

08:01.540 --> 08:08.740
about theories of spontaneous generation and life from non-life that were discussed prior

08:08.740 --> 08:13.440
to people like Pasteur who showed that this was not possible.

08:13.440 --> 08:19.860
We had Darwin talk about the warm little pond which got sunlight, which had some organic

08:19.860 --> 08:23.160
chemicals on which life could arise from there.

08:23.160 --> 08:30.480
We had the experiments of people like Miller and Ure and Fox, which took the elements expected

08:30.480 --> 08:36.760
of the primordial atmosphere, put electrical sparks in, and got organic compounds out of

08:36.760 --> 08:38.240
it.

08:38.240 --> 08:46.040
We also have hypotheses where these organic compounds could line up on community clay,

08:46.040 --> 08:53.880
this is clay along the beach, that would act as a place for to catalyze reactions among

08:53.880 --> 08:56.680
these compounds.

08:56.680 --> 09:02.040
The Chile start hypothesis, which if you had the snowball earth and a frozen seas, would

09:02.040 --> 09:09.360
protect the ocean from UV light and allow the chemicals to react and form life.

09:09.360 --> 09:14.560
A radioactive beach hypothesis, this is radioactive chemicals along the shoreline producing the

09:14.560 --> 09:18.080
heat necessary to provide the energy for this.

09:18.080 --> 09:22.800
I mentioned meteorites being able to provide organic compounds.

09:22.800 --> 09:28.480
More recently, they only were discovered in the 70s, some hydrothermal vents, deep sea

09:28.480 --> 09:36.200
vents, when these deep sea submersibles started exploring the sea bottom, and they found these

09:36.200 --> 09:41.240
areas where obvious venting was coming from the sea floor, and lo and behold, there were

09:41.240 --> 09:49.320
things living there, way out of the sunlight, at 100 atmospheres of pressure, at temperatures

09:49.320 --> 09:55.840
approaching 200 degrees C, and amazing, we call those extremophiles, that is organisms

09:55.840 --> 09:58.400
that live in extreme environments.

09:58.400 --> 10:06.360
These were suggested to people like Gunter Wachteschauser, that life might have originated

10:06.360 --> 10:13.560
there, making use of the iron and sulfur minerals as catalysts.

10:13.560 --> 10:18.880
The black smokers had sulfide, they were very close to the magma and very hot, the white

10:18.880 --> 10:25.800
smokers a little further away, a little cooler, a little more alkaline, and there was hydrogen

10:25.800 --> 10:32.080
available to get energy from, and the idea that hydrogen metabolism may have been the

10:32.080 --> 10:39.000
first energy available for life to arise, and of course any or all of these might be

10:39.000 --> 10:44.320
contributing, that is a multiple genesis hypothesis.

10:44.320 --> 10:54.440
Now once you had life, part of the chemical process using getting energy from hydrogen

10:54.440 --> 11:01.600
and methane and carbon dioxide produced oxygen as a byproduct, so this is, in a reducing

11:01.600 --> 11:08.640
anoxic environment, oxygen being released as a waste product is a toxic product.

11:08.640 --> 11:20.240
So as the environment gathered more and more oxygen, there would be adaptations to make

11:20.240 --> 11:24.560
use of this toxic waste product in a positive way.

11:24.920 --> 11:34.240
Before oxygen could accumulate, it had to react with all of the reduced iron that was

11:34.240 --> 11:35.680
floating around in the oceans.

11:35.680 --> 11:44.120
The oceans were filled with a soluble form of reduced iron, ferrous iron, and as the

11:44.120 --> 11:49.720
oxygen came into the environment, it would react with the iron, oxidize it, and this

11:49.720 --> 11:52.120
is, well, this is rust.

11:52.120 --> 12:00.720
So you had to rust all of the iron in the ocean, and that iron doesn't, it's not dissolved,

12:00.720 --> 12:09.040
it sinks, and so these thick bands of, red bands of rust accumulated at the floor of

12:09.040 --> 12:15.640
the oceans, we call these banded iron formations, and it allows us to pinpoint fairly accurately

12:15.640 --> 12:22.400
when the oxygen was produced and when the oxygen was accumulating in the environment.

12:22.400 --> 12:28.080
We know, and this is a banded iron, example of a banded iron formation from the American

12:28.080 --> 12:32.280
Museum of Natural History in New York, but there's an example in our Natural History

12:32.280 --> 12:35.760
Museum, it used to be out front, I don't know where it is now, but it used to be right

12:35.760 --> 12:41.400
out front door as you walked in every day.

12:41.400 --> 12:48.680
So this indicates prodigious amounts of oxygen being generated during this three billion

12:48.680 --> 12:51.920
years ago to two and a half billion years ago.

12:51.920 --> 12:56.720
These banded iron formations are about two and a half billion years old in the middle

12:56.720 --> 13:04.360
on average, and at the end of this period of time we come to very close to our current

13:04.360 --> 13:10.120
atmosphere, which is an oxidizing atmosphere, with one-fifth of it being oxygen, most of

13:10.120 --> 13:18.680
the rest being nitrogen, a little bit of carbon dioxide, and there are trace noble gases.

13:18.680 --> 13:20.920
Where did that oxidizing event come from?

13:20.920 --> 13:26.840
We call it the great oxidizing event, GOE, and the best guess here is the evolution

13:26.840 --> 13:35.080
of cyanobacteria, so these are bacteria, single cell animals, which we used to call blue-green

13:35.080 --> 13:39.840
algae when we were growing up, but they're not algae, they're bacteria, and they kind

13:39.840 --> 13:42.440
of look like this.

13:42.440 --> 13:46.140
This is a picture of cyanobacterium.

13:46.140 --> 13:52.000
They grow in these mats, these are current mats that are available in Western Australia,

13:52.000 --> 13:59.920
and those are layer upon layer of cyanobacterial mats producing oxygen.

13:59.920 --> 14:07.040
These also, these cells, these single cell bacteria became the precursors of the chloroplast,

14:07.040 --> 14:11.720
which is the organelle in plants that does photosynthesis and gives us oxygen today,

14:11.720 --> 14:15.200
so that's the precursor of all plants.

14:15.200 --> 14:21.400
What happens then, the history of oxygen on Earth winds up this way, very low amounts

14:21.400 --> 14:26.920
for the first two billion years, the great oxidizing event occurs, but notice that this

14:26.920 --> 14:35.080
is a log scale, this is one percent of the current atmospheric level, one percent of

14:35.200 --> 14:42.760
that would be 0.2 percent of oxygen in the atmosphere, not 20 percent, so 20 percent

14:42.760 --> 14:48.880
is what we have now, this is a much, still a very small amount, so for two billion years

14:48.880 --> 14:56.920
oxygen was a very low level, and this is a time when mitochondria started to produce

14:56.920 --> 15:07.680
multicellular animals, and we will talk about the more current time period for oxygen in

15:07.680 --> 15:14.240
part three, but right now I'd like to just summarize part one here and then stop for

15:14.240 --> 15:20.720
some questions, and the basic points that I've mentioned are that single cell prokaryotes

15:20.720 --> 15:27.360
arise about four billion years ago in the absence of oxygen, and then cyanobacteria begin

15:27.360 --> 15:32.680
to add oxygen resulting in the great oxidation event, 2.5 billion years ago as the environment

15:32.680 --> 15:35.800
shifts from no oxygen to some oxygen.

15:35.800 --> 15:42.240
One of the earlier slides you showed the meteorites and one of the chirality, what's the Italian

15:42.240 --> 15:43.240
there?

15:43.240 --> 15:48.840
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, in the organic compounds that we use, the sugars, the amino acids, some

15:48.840 --> 15:54.200
of them are asymmetric, that is they have a left handed form and a right handed form,

15:54.200 --> 16:00.880
and the biology tends to use one or the other, in the carbohydrates it's mostly the D form,

16:00.880 --> 16:08.240
the right hand form, and amino acids tends to be the L form, what happened, the chemically

16:08.240 --> 16:13.800
they're exactly the same, so how did we get to choose one over the other, because biologically

16:13.800 --> 16:18.680
you can only use one because enzymes are like a glove in a hand, you can't put a left

16:18.680 --> 16:21.200
hand glove on a right hand.

16:21.200 --> 16:28.280
And it turns out that in the meteorites there's a chiral preference as well, it indicates

16:28.280 --> 16:36.880
that possibly we get the preference from the delivery of these compounds from space.

16:36.880 --> 16:45.440
Because you can look, they've examined meteorites for example in Antarctica, in a sterile environment,

16:45.440 --> 16:52.720
and then they analyze them and they find that they have organic compounds.

16:52.720 --> 17:00.400
Is it fair to say that the low oxygen level in early days was basically until the ferrous

17:00.400 --> 17:08.720
iron got used up and became from abundant trace levels and at that point the oxygen

17:08.720 --> 17:18.880
began, it would seem to be that for the species present to survive you had to remove oxygen

17:18.880 --> 17:25.320
somehow, and that transition not only in the percent oxygen would be a great evolutionary

17:25.320 --> 17:29.040
driver to things that could tolerate oxygen.

17:29.040 --> 17:35.760
Absolutely, rise of oxygen gives you the rise of diversity and multicellularity, the iron

17:35.760 --> 17:41.200
had to go, but also the iron reacts with, I mean sorry, the oxygen reacts with the carbon

17:41.200 --> 17:44.840
compounds as well, it's carbonates and things like that.

17:44.840 --> 17:51.680
So as the, and oxidations of the minerals in the rocks, these all get buried, but there's

17:51.680 --> 17:57.000
a cycle as they rise and get weathered that gets released back into the atmosphere, so

17:57.000 --> 18:00.680
there's a long term cycle there as well.

18:00.680 --> 18:09.400
And later on, when the iron is gone, there still is a reaction with all the carbon because

18:09.400 --> 18:14.640
the animals take the carbon and make carbon dioxide out of it by burning it with oxygen,

18:14.640 --> 18:19.680
so there's a balance between oxygen utilization and plants making the oxygen.

18:19.680 --> 18:27.000
And you had very large amounts of carbon containing organisms to allow oxygen to build up to large

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
levels.

18:28.000 --> 18:31.400
If you get to the last slide or two, you'll see what I mean by that.

18:31.400 --> 18:32.800
Thank you for joining us.

18:32.800 --> 18:38.840
You've been watching Dr. Joe Lamana discussing the origin of life and prokaryotic cells, those

18:38.840 --> 18:40.760
lacking at distinct nucleus.

In the next part of the talk, Dr. Lamana discusses the origin of mitochondria and of eukaryotic

18:55.480 --> 18:57.880
cells, those with nuclei.

18:57.960 --> 19:00.000
Now back to the talk.

19:00.000 --> 19:05.680
This is the, this is probably, this is the heart of the talk, this is the origin of mitochondria.

19:05.680 --> 19:11.880
Mitochondria are the cells engine that's where all cells, all eukaryote cells mean they

19:11.880 --> 19:13.880
have a nucleus.

19:13.880 --> 19:17.640
All multicellular organisms are eukaryotic.

19:17.640 --> 19:25.560
All animals, all plants, all fungi are all organisms that have mitochondria.

19:25.560 --> 19:27.840
And the mitochondria that they have are all related.

19:27.840 --> 19:33.680
That's why we know that this event occurred only once and we all have the same related

19:33.680 --> 19:35.080
mitochondria.

19:35.080 --> 19:37.920
So let's move along.

19:37.920 --> 19:40.760
All cells need energy to function.

19:40.760 --> 19:42.560
All cells use the same organelle.

19:42.560 --> 19:43.520
That's the mitochondria.

19:43.520 --> 19:49.880
And the kind of the currency, the energy currency of the biology is adenosine triphosphate,

19:49.880 --> 19:50.880
ATP.

19:50.880 --> 19:56.040
It has a high energy phosphate on the third one and enzymes that can take that phosphate

19:56.040 --> 20:02.560
off also get a lot of energy from it and ATP becomes ADP, diphosphate from triphosphate

20:02.560 --> 20:04.480
and you get a lot of energy from it.

20:04.480 --> 20:09.520
And the mitochondria takes the ADP, makes ATP for us.

20:09.520 --> 20:13.440
And it looks something like this, kind of looks like a bacterium and that was obvious

20:13.440 --> 20:16.640
to the people who first saw them.

20:16.640 --> 20:23.200
It's double membrane organism, like a bacterial cell, and it's got its own genetic material

20:23.200 --> 20:30.040
in it as well as the ability to make its own proteins, got ribosomes and the ability to

20:30.040 --> 20:31.040
make its own proteins.

20:31.040 --> 20:34.960
I'll talk more about how this works a little bit later in part three.

20:34.960 --> 20:41.440
But in most typical eukaryotic cells have the nucleus, which is number two here, followed

20:41.440 --> 20:48.280
by number five, which is a lot of the protein making machinery, this is Golgi apparatus.

20:48.280 --> 20:53.080
But here's our friend, the mitochondrion, which is providing the energy for all the

20:53.080 --> 20:55.720
work done by the eukaryotic cells.

20:55.720 --> 21:01.160
And eukaryotic cells are about 10 times bigger than bacteria, because bacteria about the

21:01.160 --> 21:03.080
same size as mitochondria.

21:03.080 --> 21:06.680
So you get an idea of the size orientation.

21:06.680 --> 21:16.560
They were originally seen by histologists who were, these are just barely at the edge

21:16.560 --> 21:20.760
of visibility in a light level microscope.

21:20.760 --> 21:25.760
And people like Altman thought they looked like bacteria.

21:25.760 --> 21:28.840
It wasn't sure whether they were bacteria, but they looked like bacteria.

21:28.840 --> 21:32.640
He referred to them as bioblasts.

21:32.640 --> 21:39.840
Here they were named mitochondria from the Greek, which means thread-like granules, because

21:39.840 --> 21:47.400
as Benda looked at it, he saw that they were connected with little bulges on them, looked

21:47.400 --> 21:51.600
like a thread that had granules along it.

21:51.600 --> 21:59.040
And it was known from biological dyes that they were associated with living cells.

21:59.040 --> 22:01.360
You couldn't stain them if the cell was dead.

22:01.360 --> 22:05.640
If the cell was alive, they took up this dye.

22:05.640 --> 22:11.680
And because of that, it was suggested that they were involved in the oxygen respiration,

22:11.680 --> 22:14.640
that is, the utilization of oxygen to make energy.

22:14.640 --> 22:21.000
And it was really confirmed after World War II by a lender who wrote the classic textbook

22:21.000 --> 22:29.920
on biochemistry that, indeed, this is the organelle that makes ATP from oxygen and substrate.

22:29.920 --> 22:37.800
There's a whole story involved in the electron transport chain that's maybe for another time.

22:37.800 --> 22:47.400
Now in the mid-60s, Lynn Margulis proposed that these mitochondria not only looked like

22:47.400 --> 22:51.680
bacteria, but they must have come from, they must be bacteria.

22:51.680 --> 22:59.600
And so she proposed the bacterial origin of mitochondria and was able to publish her

23:00.520 --> 23:05.600
paper in the Journal of Theoretical Biology in 1967 using her married name.

23:05.600 --> 23:08.600
She was married to Carl Sagan.

23:08.600 --> 23:11.480
So Lynn Sagan published this.

23:11.480 --> 23:17.600
It was rejected in 14 journals before it was published in the Journal of Theoretical Biology

23:17.600 --> 23:22.080
because it was a crazy idea of mitochondria coming from bacteria.

23:22.080 --> 23:24.320
But they look like bacteria.

23:24.320 --> 23:28.880
They have the same genetic base pair distribution.

23:28.880 --> 23:36.480
New karyotic cells have more of the AT base pair than the CG, but bacterial and mitochondrial

23:36.480 --> 23:41.480
DNA have equal amounts of those pairs.

23:41.480 --> 23:43.160
They have no histones.

23:43.160 --> 23:45.080
They don't fold up.

23:45.080 --> 23:47.800
They have a different ribosome to make protein from.

23:47.800 --> 23:52.720
And in every case, the bacterial and the mitochondrial are identical.

23:52.720 --> 24:01.120
So we have come to understand that Lynn Margulis was indeed correct and mitochondria started

24:01.120 --> 24:03.320
out as bacteria.

24:03.320 --> 24:12.280
And the idea was an archaea, a protea, it's another prokaryote, but not a bacterium, an

24:12.280 --> 24:13.280
archaea.

24:13.280 --> 24:19.800
It's a different domain of life, had different characteristics, engulfed a proteobacterium.

24:19.800 --> 24:26.160
The proteobacterium was able to resist the digestive attempts of the archaea.

24:26.160 --> 24:28.960
And then a symbiotic relationship occurred.

24:28.960 --> 24:35.680
They had different metabolic processes that turned out to be synergistic.

24:35.680 --> 24:40.720
This may or may not have happened quite a few times, but at least one time it worked

24:40.720 --> 24:44.640
so well that it dominated life from then on.

24:44.640 --> 24:51.520
So you have the generation of the first eukaryote cell.

24:51.520 --> 24:59.560
And it required a nucleus to occur to sequester the DNA from the host cell so that it wouldn't

24:59.560 --> 25:03.200
mix up too badly with the DNA from the bacterium.

25:03.200 --> 25:11.000
But a lot of eukaryote DNA comes from bacterial sources.

25:12.000 --> 25:18.920
Just on the DNA differences, a nuclear DNA made with base pairs, coils and then coils

25:18.920 --> 25:23.360
again and then the coils coil and the coils coil again, and it's covered with histones

25:23.360 --> 25:29.520
that keep it from just generating all kinds of mRNA until it's needed.

25:29.520 --> 25:37.360
Whereas bacterial cells like this E. coli have these plasmids, these kind of circles of DNA

25:37.720 --> 25:41.960
that are same as mitochondria.

25:41.960 --> 25:49.440
Now the nuclear DNA in each cell, human cell, there's about 10 feet of DNA if you stretch

25:49.440 --> 25:50.960
it out in each cell.

25:50.960 --> 25:55.000
So you took all your DNA and stretched out end to end.

25:55.000 --> 25:59.120
You could go back and forth to the moon 70 times.

25:59.120 --> 26:04.880
That's a lot of DNA coiled up very tightly in each cell.

26:04.920 --> 26:10.000
On the other hand, and there's only one copy per cell.

26:10.000 --> 26:16.000
In mitochondria, mitochondria have smaller genomes, only 13 genes.

26:16.000 --> 26:20.200
Those bacteria that became mitochondria have lost a lot of their genes.

26:20.200 --> 26:25.600
And there's 5 to 10 copies, these plasmids, in each mitochondrian.

26:25.600 --> 26:29.600
And there's multiple mitochondria, maybe hundreds per cell.

26:29.600 --> 26:38.040
So there's a lot of copies of the mitochondrial genome that mitochondria can divide independently.

26:38.040 --> 26:45.520
And the copies of the DNA can be reproduced fairly quickly compared to the nuclear DNA.

26:45.520 --> 26:51.080
So as I say, the mitochondrial genome, it's kind of a circular plasmid type DNA, and it

26:51.080 --> 26:58.640
has 13 to 20 genes that are the minimum required for the mitochondria to control certain of

26:58.640 --> 27:00.920
its functions locally.

27:00.920 --> 27:07.160
The reason it does it is that sometimes the mitochondria can be very far from the cell

27:07.160 --> 27:08.160
nucleus.

27:08.160 --> 27:13.640
Imagine a nerve cell where the nucleus is in the spinal cord and the axon goes all the

27:13.640 --> 27:16.560
way down to the big toe.

27:16.560 --> 27:20.320
That's a long distance away from the nucleus if you depend upon the nucleus to be making

27:20.320 --> 27:22.000
the proteins you need.

27:22.000 --> 27:27.000
And also to be able to respond to local energy demand, you need local control.

27:27.720 --> 27:35.080
So the significance of mitochondrial DNA is we get all our mitochondria from our mothers.

27:35.080 --> 27:40.600
The egg has the mitochondria, the sperm uses all the mitochondria it has, its energy to

27:40.600 --> 27:48.160
get to the egg, but only one set of mitochondria are left.

27:48.160 --> 27:56.160
And we can use that evidence to look at, by looking at rates of mitochondrial mutation,

27:56.160 --> 28:00.200
to predict when the first human mitochondria appeared.

28:00.200 --> 28:07.440
And that would have been in our maternal line, so we call that first human eve, and we think

28:07.440 --> 28:12.560
maybe it was 170,000 years ago, although there's a lot of speculation, there's a lot of work

28:12.560 --> 28:14.240
that goes into this.

28:14.240 --> 28:17.280
It's not a done story by any means.

28:17.280 --> 28:21.560
And also mitochondria help control what we call apoptosis.

28:21.560 --> 28:26.040
This is a Greek word that refers to things like where the leaves fall off the trees in

28:26.040 --> 28:27.040
the autumn.

28:27.040 --> 28:34.400
It's a programmed cell death, or it's like a cell suicide, and this is triggered when

28:34.400 --> 28:41.080
the energy capacity or the energy system, the mitochondria, gets so damaged that they

28:41.080 --> 28:46.320
can no longer provide energy for the cell, then they trigger the death of the cell so

28:46.320 --> 28:51.680
that it can be phagocytized and doesn't gum up the work, so to speak.

28:51.680 --> 28:57.680
And it's also very important to study the mitochondrial DNA as we get towards understanding

28:57.680 --> 29:00.920
mitochondrial aging.

29:00.920 --> 29:06.840
And Nick Lane, who is a good scientist and also a good writer, this is an interesting

29:06.840 --> 29:12.440
book on the subject, if you're interested, called Power Sex and Suicide, and it's all

29:12.440 --> 29:14.360
about mitochondria.

29:14.360 --> 29:23.680
And he's pointing out that the fact that life occurred almost immediately when it was

29:23.680 --> 29:29.400
available in its single cell form was not that remarkable, but multicellularity depended

29:29.400 --> 29:36.760
upon a unique event, and that is a synergistic endosymbiosis to have it occurred.

29:36.760 --> 29:41.880
Once it occurred, it only happened that once, while mitochondria are related.

29:41.880 --> 29:45.400
We think it comes from purple bacteria.

29:45.400 --> 29:54.320
These have a chlorophyll-like substance, they have different colors in them, they can't

29:54.320 --> 30:00.240
live with oxygen, they use sulfur for their energy system.

30:00.240 --> 30:05.560
And the other side of it is the archaea, these are what would be called the pioneer

30:05.560 --> 30:09.600
organism in the iron sulfur world theory.

30:09.600 --> 30:14.520
These are methane, these are methanogens, meaning they make methane, they get their

30:14.520 --> 30:21.080
energy from CO2 and hydrogen, but the problem is hydrogen is scarce, so finding sources

30:21.080 --> 30:26.160
of hydrogen is crucial for these cells.

30:26.160 --> 30:30.280
They're not bacteria and they're not eukaryotes, they have a different cell membrane, it's

30:30.280 --> 30:36.760
polysaccharitic, and they can go anywhere because they make their own energy from light

30:36.760 --> 30:39.360
or from chemical processes.

30:39.560 --> 30:45.640
These are some of the places where they occur.

30:45.640 --> 30:53.280
These are the black smokers, they're black because they have sulfur compounds, they exist

30:53.280 --> 30:59.680
near magma in the deep ocean trenches, this is where the continents are pulling apart,

30:59.680 --> 31:06.680
the plates are moving apart, magma heats the water, spews all kinds of minerals here, it's

31:06.680 --> 31:12.480
very rich in minerals, there's no oxygen but there's plenty of other sources of chemical

31:12.480 --> 31:16.080
energy and of course you have thermal energy.

31:16.080 --> 31:22.760
And if you look at the one on the right, there's tube worms and what are called squat

31:22.760 --> 31:29.920
lobsters, I don't know, but these are deep sea vents located maybe at two and three kilometers

31:30.000 --> 31:37.000
depth, so a hundred atmospheres pressure where the water maybe four or five hundred

31:37.000 --> 31:43.400
degrees in the case of the black smoker, it's still liquid because of the pressure, and

31:43.400 --> 31:51.240
it's a very acidic environment, that was for the black smokers, I just said most of this.

31:51.240 --> 31:57.280
The first one was discovered in 1977 as these underwater submarines started looking at mapping

31:57.280 --> 32:06.720
the seabed as a source of the iron and nickel, the reduced forms and chemosynthetic bacteria

32:06.720 --> 32:18.320
live in these, this one didn't come up, there it is, the white smoker, these were discovered

32:18.320 --> 32:23.240
only in 2000, these are a little further away from the trench so the water is cooler, these

32:23.240 --> 32:28.880
are steam that's bubbling up through the rock, instead of big holes they're from little

32:28.880 --> 32:35.400
porous labyrinthine tubes which produce lots of surface area for chemical reactions to

32:35.400 --> 32:49.560
occur and they're more alkaline than acidic and it's thought that these, the life that's

32:49.600 --> 32:56.040
here represents some of the organisms that we're familiar with, lots of barium, calcium,

32:56.040 --> 33:07.520
silicon, they make serpentinite, this is a compound of iron and magnesium and barium

33:07.520 --> 33:15.320
and calcium that has green, looks like green snakes running through it, today you can find

33:15.360 --> 33:21.960
these type of archaea in places like Yellowstone National Park, Yellowstone National Park,

33:21.960 --> 33:31.840
this is one of the geysers, it's a hot spring and it shows the steam coming out of the center

33:31.840 --> 33:41.600
of it here, yeah, but all along the side this color, the orange color is coming from the algae,

33:41.960 --> 33:47.800
the bacteria and the archaea and these are like, again like the purple bacteria, these are

33:47.800 --> 33:53.280
carotenoids and bacterial chlorophylls and the colors change with the temperature and the

33:53.280 --> 33:59.400
seasons and so sometimes they're more purple or green and sometimes more orange depends on the

33:59.720 --> 34:12.120
conditions, very very colorful, so basically in part two what we have is we have the event

34:12.120 --> 34:21.760
that occurred, we have the last eukaryotic common ancestor that is the eukaryote cell that joined

34:21.920 --> 34:32.320
an archaea with a proteobacterium that became the precursor cell of all eukaryotes going towards

34:32.320 --> 34:40.440
the future and all these, there are three domains of life, the bacterial domain, the archaean domain

34:40.440 --> 34:51.080
and the eukaryote domain and the eukaryote domain produces plants, animals, fungi and all life

34:51.200 --> 34:59.640
from eukaryote domain has mitochondria that allows them to take advantage of the changes in the

34:59.640 --> 35:08.200
environment that we're occurring and to grow into multicellular organisms and animals, so I would

35:08.200 --> 35:18.680
stop here and take some questions about mitochondrial origins. What has to happen to the bacteria? One

35:18.760 --> 35:27.800
thing it has to be able to resist being digested is food by the archaean engulfer and then it has to

35:28.680 --> 35:35.240
keep from poisoning the genes of the archaean, remember the archaean engulfer doesn't have a

35:35.240 --> 35:40.760
nucleus and so its genes are floating around and now when the bacterial releases their genes they

35:40.760 --> 35:46.520
get mixed up and most of the time that's going to be disastrous and so a lot of those engulfments

35:46.520 --> 35:53.880
that would normally have occurred are going to be worthless, damaging rather than productive, so it

35:53.880 --> 36:01.080
had to be a very tricky event that occurred that allowed the bacteria to first survive and then

36:01.080 --> 36:07.800
figure out how to keep its DNA from getting too mixed up with the other cells DNA. Have scientists

36:07.800 --> 36:19.320
now been able to do this in a laboratory setting put an archaean and a proteal bacteria together?

36:19.320 --> 36:26.680
Actually that has been seen in nature and in the lab they haven't made mitochondria but there are

36:26.680 --> 36:36.760
examples of symbiotic endosymbiotic organisms existing today. Could you make a comment about

36:36.760 --> 36:43.800
the variation in the structure of mitochondria of one species compared to another and this refers

36:43.800 --> 36:52.760
again to this question of mitochondrial eave you know and whether you know you can have a continuous

36:52.760 --> 36:59.240
feed of mitochondria from other species into another. Mitochondria are more similar than they are

36:59.240 --> 37:07.000
different. The genes that encode the local proteins and also a lot of the proteins that come from the

37:07.000 --> 37:17.720
nucleus those genes can vary but the proteins that they're producing are identical so almost all

37:17.720 --> 37:26.600
mitochondria are just mitochondria. Now there's local changes that can change them to a certain

37:26.600 --> 37:30.840
extent but they have about the they all have the cytochrome chain the electron transport chain

37:30.840 --> 37:36.120
they have about the same density of energy production the same sizes they're they're more

37:36.120 --> 37:41.400
similar than than people are similar to each other mitochondria from all different organisms.

37:42.360 --> 37:49.080
By looking at the ultra structure picture of a mitochondrian you couldn't tell where it came

37:50.040 --> 37:57.480
when they do investigation like for my sister's a brother we share the same mitochondria right

37:58.680 --> 38:02.200
you got from your mother yes from my mother right so

38:06.280 --> 38:11.800
when you go back to eave right and we go back to all these various things that the

38:12.520 --> 38:19.000
you know anthropologists find at the natural history museum those those humans do they have

38:19.000 --> 38:25.720
the same mitochondria or that hundred and seventy thousand year thing is set in stone and you cannot

38:25.720 --> 38:31.160
so every once in a while there would be a mutation that would change one of the base pairs

38:32.600 --> 38:37.080
and might not affect the protein too much it might be in a non-coding area just like in the

38:37.160 --> 38:44.840
nuclear uh uh genome so you can watch that you you can look at that going backwards you get the

38:45.800 --> 38:52.360
types uh and and you could follow the changes in in the populations of mitochondria going back

38:52.360 --> 38:58.120
you could see how often the change occurs and then you could predict how far back the first one had

38:58.120 --> 39:05.400
to be uh for this particular lineage. We hope you've been enjoying the origin science scholars

39:05.400 --> 39:11.720
program with Dr. Joe Lamana. Dr. Lamana is a Janet M and Joseph S Silver Professor for the

39:11.720 --> 39:17.800
study of brain sciences at Case Western Reserve University. In the second part of our talk we

39:17.800 --> 39:23.400
learned how early bacteria were taken up by prokaryotic cells and eventually became the cellular

39:23.400 --> 39:30.200
powerhouses we know as mitochondria. In our final segment Dr. Lamana will discuss the role of oxygen

39:30.200 --> 39:37.240
and mitochondria in the evolution of multicellular organisms. Now back to our talk. All right let's move

39:37.240 --> 39:44.280
to uh part three then and uh this involves uh it's a little jumpy here it's got the role of

39:44.280 --> 39:50.920
mitochondria so we got some examples of how mitochondria participate and the role of oxygen

39:50.920 --> 40:00.040
as the mitochondrial partner in in evolution and in extreme examples of energy consumption.

40:00.760 --> 40:07.720
So here's our mitochondrion again and the what we're going to talk about is to show

40:08.760 --> 40:14.920
how the mitochondrion can go about generating energy in a in a very

40:15.720 --> 40:23.320
uh uh outline form that I think it will make it uh understandable. Basically what the mitochondrion

40:23.320 --> 40:31.960
does is it takes the hydrogen that we get from eating food and it burns it with oxygen that we

40:31.960 --> 40:37.080
get from breathing it in from the atmosphere and when you burn the hydrogen with the oxygen

40:37.080 --> 40:43.240
you get a tremendous amount of energy from that uh and that energy then gets transferred into

40:43.240 --> 40:50.200
ATP molecules that the cells can then use to do the work of the cell. So the first step is getting

40:50.200 --> 40:58.840
the hydrogen that's done through uh the uh tca tricarboxylic acid cycle that was this that was

40:58.840 --> 41:04.600
worked out by Hans Krebs, Sir Hans Krebs in Oxford and sometimes called the Krebs cycle

41:05.240 --> 41:11.400
and I'm showing Sir Hans in a in a standard biochemistry joke of Hans Krebs riding a cycle

41:11.400 --> 41:18.760
so it could be Hans Krebs cycle uh it's required of all biochemists I think to make that joke

41:19.720 --> 41:27.720
but basically the hydrogen from sugar comes in it's converted through this cycle of compounds

41:27.720 --> 41:34.360
and enzymes and the hydrogen is transferred to the mitochondrion and this is where the

41:34.360 --> 41:39.880
carbon dioxide comes from so in changing getting the hydrogen from the food the carbon dioxide

41:39.880 --> 41:44.840
is pulled off the molecules so we breathe out the carbon dioxide and the hydrogen is passed

41:44.840 --> 41:50.680
on to the mitochondrion and then here's where the magic occurs we have a number of compartments

41:50.680 --> 41:58.520
in the mitochondrion so let me spend just a few minutes with this diagram it's a it's two membranes

41:59.160 --> 42:05.880
two membranes an outer membrane that's here number two is the outer membrane and an inner membrane

42:05.880 --> 42:13.560
and that means that there's then two spaces that are important there's the intermembrane space

42:13.560 --> 42:18.360
between the inner and outer membrane and then there's the space that is completely

42:19.240 --> 42:24.440
surrounded by the inner membrane we call this the matrix and it's in the matrix that the

42:24.440 --> 42:31.080
Krebs cycle is working to make the hydrogen available and that the cytochrome chain which is

42:31.080 --> 42:37.320
a number of these proteins lined up one after another the job that they do is to separate

42:37.320 --> 42:44.120
the electron from the proton because hydrogen is a proton and electron and so the hydrogen

42:44.920 --> 42:50.600
proton goes out into the intermembrane space and the electron goes passed on to the next

42:50.600 --> 42:56.760
member of the cytochrome chain at the end of that chain is a molecule called cytochrome oxidase

42:56.840 --> 43:01.400
it looks very similar to hemoglobin it has a pocket that oxygen can bind to

43:02.040 --> 43:08.440
and the oxygen binds in that pocket of the cytochrome oxidase the electrons come streaming down and

43:08.440 --> 43:16.920
when four reach it it turns the oxygen into water it reduces the oxygen to water and so

43:17.480 --> 43:22.440
as you have oxygen there it pulls the electrons through and as it pulls the electrons through

43:22.440 --> 43:27.480
the hydrogen is pumped out what good is that well because you have now a big difference between

43:27.480 --> 43:33.960
the amount of hydrogen in the intermembrane space and almost none in the matrix that hydrogen

43:34.680 --> 43:41.400
creates a concentration gradient and it comes pouring in through this very specialized pour

43:42.360 --> 43:49.400
which is an ATP synthase and as it comes down the energy in that gradient is used to make ATP

43:49.400 --> 43:58.520
from ADP and that's magic this is in reality each mitochondrion acts as a hydrogen fuel cell

43:58.520 --> 44:03.880
if you're familiar with hydrogen batteries and you know how much energy you can get out of it

44:03.880 --> 44:09.960
you can run a tesla from hydrogen batteries essentially right so this is the same idea

44:09.960 --> 44:16.920
that is hydrogen is separated into electrons that flow through the electric circuit

44:17.640 --> 44:24.120
and then the protons are used to or the electrons as they flow through are you are drawn away

44:24.120 --> 44:30.120
by the oxygen to make water and you have your fuel cell your battery your hydrogen battery

44:31.640 --> 44:41.400
okay so what's the advantage suppose you just burn sugar in the case of without oxygen so no

44:41.400 --> 44:49.000
oxygen this is just sugar being used to make some energy you get two ATP for an amount of sugar

44:49.000 --> 44:57.320
say and if you're a bacterium or a penicillin mold or something like that you could do just

44:57.320 --> 45:05.160
about what a mold can do not much although they do a good job on that bread lactic acid is the

45:05.160 --> 45:11.480
endpoint and this is you know if you exercise strongly you get into an oxygen debt and you

45:11.480 --> 45:18.440
build up lactic acid well you know that that you can't keep running you need to stop and get oxygen

45:18.440 --> 45:28.040
to replace the energy the burning the sugar with oxygen gives you almost 20 times as much

45:28.040 --> 45:36.280
ATP as you get from running it without oxygen it's a huge energy advantage 20 times the amount of

45:36.280 --> 45:45.240
energy and this allows the cell to do a lot more than a prokaryote can do without the oxygen burning

45:45.240 --> 45:51.960
ability i have that little marshmallow in there just to remind me to give you an example of the

45:51.960 --> 45:57.000
amount of energy and sugar when you burn it if you've you've you've burned your marshmallows over

45:57.000 --> 46:02.040
your campfires it catches fire and it burns pretty well there's a lot of energy and sugar when you

46:02.040 --> 46:08.760
burn it with a with oxygen of course the cell takes it in small pieces and turns that into ATP rather

46:08.760 --> 46:18.120
than let it burn like that and nature takes the mitochondria and it puts it where it needs to be

46:18.200 --> 46:24.920
inside the cell this is another example of of how a the different cells

46:25.880 --> 46:32.360
evolve their different structures in order to do the function that they're required and provide

46:32.360 --> 46:38.120
the energy to do that function so this is a mitochondrion that sits inside a muscle cell

46:38.120 --> 46:45.720
those striations and top and bottom are the are the muscle fibers that are going to use the energy

46:45.720 --> 46:51.880
produced by the mitochondrion and each mitochondrion essentially produces the same pretty much the

46:51.880 --> 46:58.360
same amount of energy it has about the same components so you if you look at the volume of

46:58.360 --> 47:04.280
mitochondria you can get a pretty good idea of the ability of the cell to generate you know how

47:04.280 --> 47:12.440
much energy you can generate and i have a couple of examples here that i think are pretty impressive

47:13.400 --> 47:21.080
on the left you have a muscle from a mako shark and it's these are muscle fibers that are cut in

47:21.080 --> 47:26.200
cross-section they're going in and out of the board and right next to each one of them are these

47:27.240 --> 47:33.960
mitochondria so these are mitochondria these the muscle cell this is the mitochondria very close

47:35.000 --> 47:40.600
and a lot of volume so you have essentially looks like pretty much the similar amount of volume in

47:40.600 --> 47:45.800
mitochondria producing the energy as you have in the muscle cells that are producing the work

47:46.600 --> 47:52.760
this might be similar to thinking about an electric car that has half the weight of it is batteries

47:54.280 --> 48:00.760
in order to do what it has to do the other and so this is a shark muscle so it's a cartilaginous fish

48:01.560 --> 48:07.720
but on the other side we have a mammalian tissue it's a heart muscle cardiac muscle

48:07.720 --> 48:14.280
happens to be from a mouse but it's pretty much similar here these are the the lines of the muscle

48:14.280 --> 48:19.480
so those are the ones that are pulling apart and going together and these are all mitochondria

48:20.280 --> 48:26.520
sit in the middle of these fibers of the heart this is the nucleus of the heart muscle here's

48:26.520 --> 48:33.240
a pile of mitochondria cardiac muscle about 40 percent of the volume is mitochondria that's about

48:33.800 --> 48:38.120
and there's a maybe half of it or a little more maybe is the is the striated muscle

48:38.120 --> 48:45.640
but the ratio is is pretty pretty good in brain tissue for example that ratio is about 10 percent

48:45.640 --> 48:51.560
of that volume is mitochondrial so it shows you the difference in the energy requirements

48:52.120 --> 48:58.600
brain versus heart now this is probably my my favorite one this is a hummingbird flight muscle

48:58.680 --> 49:06.920
hummingbird that beats 300 times a second and can stop and hover in the air and these uh this is

49:06.920 --> 49:13.640
really impressive these are capillaries and here's the mitochondria between the capillaries

49:13.640 --> 49:19.080
is a nucleus of a cell and there's the muscle cells here you have more mitochondria than you have

49:19.080 --> 49:25.560
muscle that makes sense if you think about it right and here's a close-up on the capillary

49:25.880 --> 49:32.280
it's a cell in the middle of that capillary and it's filled surrounded by mitochondria

49:33.080 --> 49:39.160
here's what's using oxygen what's producing the ATP here's the muscle thin strand of muscle

49:40.360 --> 49:48.040
completely surrounded by uh mitochondria so it's it's pretty impressive and you can understand how

49:48.920 --> 49:54.200
the hummingbird can accomplish what it does how the shark can accomplish what it was how the heart

49:54.200 --> 49:58.840
can accomplish what it has to do for for that length of time that you that you needed to work

50:00.920 --> 50:05.960
all right so let's go move on a little bit now and talk about the multicellular organisms

50:06.520 --> 50:10.520
in a way it's a little backward but what I did is I showed you what the capabilities

50:10.520 --> 50:16.840
of the system is once you can provide the energy and here's how it impacts things like

50:17.160 --> 50:24.680
uh uh uh evolution if you're an organism and you're working at the substrate level

50:24.680 --> 50:31.160
that's making lactate say without having the advantage of making oxygen your energy providing

50:31.160 --> 50:41.400
system is uh only about 10 efficient it's not much 10 that means if you had a predator come along

50:41.400 --> 50:48.360
and want to take advantage of the energy that you have and it grabs you and it's 10 efficient now

50:48.360 --> 50:56.360
it becomes 1 percent 10 percent of 10 percent is 1 percent and that's not a that's not a good deal

50:56.360 --> 51:01.240
it costs more to do the engulfing and the digesting than you get out of it so there's

51:01.240 --> 51:08.360
very little predation at the level of single cell organisms that are prokaryotic but with

51:08.360 --> 51:14.600
oxidative phosphorylation that allows you to use oxygen to generate energy you're around 40 percent

51:14.600 --> 51:21.160
efficient now the first person in the chain gets grabbed by the next person it's 40 percent of 40

51:21.160 --> 51:26.840
percent and then 40 percent 40 percent 40 percent and you could develop a chain at least six

51:27.960 --> 51:36.760
layers deep before you run below one percent of the energy supply left that means that predators

51:36.760 --> 51:44.680
now have an advantage can gain an advantage in their competition with other organisms and

51:45.640 --> 51:53.160
the bigger the cell then the better the predator so predation tends to produce larger and larger

51:53.160 --> 51:59.560
cells or organisms and prey doesn't sit around waiting to be preyed on it does the same

52:00.120 --> 52:09.400
strategy and starts getting bigger for protection so when once you have this efficiency in the chain

52:10.200 --> 52:17.880
then you have the ability to really stimulate growth and diversity and development

52:18.920 --> 52:25.000
so why didn't bacteria get larger they had two billion years before the event that made

52:25.080 --> 52:31.880
mitochondria and that's because the way prokaryotes work their energy producing system

52:31.880 --> 52:36.360
those that prokaryot bacterial cell that went to become the mitochondria

52:36.360 --> 52:41.960
was still making energy based upon its own surface area and if it got bigger its energy

52:41.960 --> 52:47.080
requirements would grow with the volume by the cube but its ability to make energy would only grow

52:47.080 --> 52:52.840
by the square root of the surface area that's not a good strategy but once you put the

52:52.840 --> 52:59.720
mitochondria inside the cell you can add mitochondria you really could add them and then

52:59.720 --> 53:05.480
your energy production capacity will grow with the volume of the cell but your utilization for

53:05.480 --> 53:12.600
most cells can be or is related to the surface area that's a much more favorable relationship

53:13.640 --> 53:19.960
so bacteria we're not going to be able to get anywhere with a 10 percent energy efficiency

53:20.520 --> 53:26.600
and they couldn't grow larger anyway because of surface volume considerations

53:28.200 --> 53:35.240
and bacteria are very successful in their niche but it's a simple solution and it's not going to

53:35.240 --> 53:41.960
get complex they work very well and the successful bacteria are the ones that can divide fastest

53:41.960 --> 53:48.280
and that means you can't have a lot of genes because that takes time to reproduce your genes

53:48.280 --> 53:54.280
so the smaller the number of genes you have the faster you can reproduce and the more successful

53:54.280 --> 54:03.560
you are so the prokaryote philosophy the prokaryote strategy keeps the cells simple and small

54:04.120 --> 54:09.720
and successful but simple and small until you've got mitochondria you can't get complexity

54:11.480 --> 54:16.840
now let's look at the more modern part of the oxygen curve in the last minute or so

54:18.840 --> 54:24.040
and this represents oxygen variations that we know closer to our own time

54:24.040 --> 54:29.640
this is half a half a billion years this is from essentially the Cambrian explosion of life

54:29.640 --> 54:35.800
on to present day and if you plot in the yellow curve there oxygen levels you see it's not constant

54:36.760 --> 54:43.880
it varies up and down and what we now know from this up and down is that the rates of evolutionary

54:43.880 --> 54:51.240
diversity and the die off in the extinctions are related in a great measure to the oxygen

54:51.960 --> 54:58.440
history so that at times when oxygen is rising you have increase in diversity taking advantage of

54:58.440 --> 55:04.520
the everything that oxygen can give you in terms of energy from the mitochondria but when oxygen

55:04.520 --> 55:11.160
becomes limiting then the inefficient forms die off there's one particular there's a lot of information

55:11.160 --> 55:16.920
here but i want to focus on this one here this peak this is when oxygen reached about 35 percent

55:16.920 --> 55:24.120
in the atmosphere remember today it's 21 percent there was 35 percent that's as much it's a maximum

55:24.120 --> 55:30.040
because any more than that and the the forest would burn and you wouldn't be producing more oxygen

55:30.040 --> 55:35.560
so there's a limit and that's it right oh okay so

55:39.400 --> 55:45.160
at that time you had a higher density in the atmosphere because that was all extra oxygen

55:45.160 --> 55:53.320
and you allowed the gigantic insects and flying insects and that the only thing i had left to try

55:53.320 --> 55:59.000
to get through is just to give you some idea of what the human body does and we produce about 85

55:59.000 --> 56:08.840
watts of energy about a good strong light bulb and we use about the 150 balloons worth of air

56:08.840 --> 56:16.280
per day and we produce a half liter of water from metabolism every day and the mitochondria in our

56:16.280 --> 56:25.000
body make essentially a hundred pounds of ATP every day by cycling ADP that's about half the

56:25.000 --> 56:32.200
body's weight of ATP cycling and that's that's the strength of the mitochondria and with that i will

56:33.320 --> 56:36.920
let's just summarize what we said and i'll say thanks and ask for final questions
