00:26.000 --> 00:32.320
Tonight, it's my pleasure to introduce Professor Michael Hincheski, who is the Warren E. Rupp

00:32.320 --> 00:37.680
Assistant Professor in the Department of Physics here at Case Western Reserve University.

00:37.680 --> 00:42.800
As Dr. Hincheski writes, random fluctuations pervade cellular biology from the level of

00:42.800 --> 00:49.200
individual biochemical reactions to the intricate machinery responsible for transport and signaling.

00:49.200 --> 00:55.680
And yet, despite the noise at all scales, collective order emerges, a bewildering hierarchy

00:55.680 --> 01:00.440
of interconnected processes carefully arranged throughout the volume of the cell.

01:00.440 --> 01:05.920
Tonight, he will tell us where that order might come from as he talks about thermodynamics

01:05.920 --> 01:07.600
and the origin of life.

01:07.600 --> 01:11.760
Please join me in welcoming him.

01:11.760 --> 01:16.760
What I want to talk today, in some ways, the entire topic of the talk, is a field of physics

01:16.800 --> 01:21.520
which maybe a lot of people have not heard of because it's not quite always in the news.

01:21.520 --> 01:23.520
It's known as non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

01:23.520 --> 01:28.400
It has kind of an unwieldy name, but the questions it asks are, in some ways, some of the most

01:28.400 --> 01:31.920
fundamental questions we can ask about nature.

01:31.920 --> 01:37.720
So in particular, one of the central aspects of it is that physical systems tend to disorder.

01:37.720 --> 01:42.200
This is the thing, the famous concept of entropy, which is famous, in particular, for being

01:42.200 --> 01:47.400
extremely confusing, not just to non-physicists, but to physicists themselves.

01:47.400 --> 01:51.000
And so what I'm going to try to do in this talk, in some ways, the central theme of it,

01:51.000 --> 01:55.100
is to hopefully make that concept a little bit less confusing, or if that fails, at least

01:55.100 --> 01:59.280
confuse you in a way you haven't been confused before.

01:59.280 --> 02:05.800
So I study biological things, so biological things are not entirely disordered.

02:05.800 --> 02:10.920
So one of the fascinating aspects of this topic is also, despite the fact this tendency

02:11.440 --> 02:13.680
toward disorder, why does complexity arise?

02:13.680 --> 02:20.600
And this leads into very interesting questions, people debate whether how the second law influences

02:20.600 --> 02:22.280
the origin of life.

02:22.280 --> 02:28.720
So we're going to try to kind of disentangle some of the confusion in that area.

02:28.720 --> 02:31.800
And most importantly, as you'll see, this is what I'm going to do with the themes of

02:31.800 --> 02:34.840
the later part of the talk, at what cost.

02:34.840 --> 02:39.160
So we're going to show, and of course this is obvious because we exist, that indeed complexity

02:39.160 --> 02:45.520
does exist in nature, but it comes at an inherent cost, a thermodynamic cost, which

02:45.520 --> 02:48.120
will explicate.

02:48.120 --> 02:54.560
And kind of putting all these ideas together, what can they tell us about how life arose?

02:54.560 --> 02:59.120
Can they actually give us some clues as to the fundamental mechanisms four billion years

02:59.120 --> 03:02.920
ago where these living things first arose?

03:02.920 --> 03:07.480
Now these are all kind of extremely weighty questions, very complex systems and topics,

03:07.880 --> 03:11.920
and we're going to start somewhere seemingly completely ridiculously simple.

03:11.920 --> 03:14.880
But I think it's a nice illustration of some of the basic ideas.

03:14.880 --> 03:16.880
We're going to play a game.

03:16.880 --> 03:20.720
This game is called Billiards on a Bunimovic stadium.

03:20.720 --> 03:25.680
This is a shape shown here on the left that's named after Russian mathematician, and hence

03:25.680 --> 03:28.560
it kind of looks like a hockey stadium.

03:28.560 --> 03:30.360
And the game is going to be simple.

03:30.360 --> 03:32.360
We're going to start with one particle initially.

03:32.360 --> 03:35.520
And what I'm going to do is you're going to pay attention to the kind of position space.

03:35.520 --> 03:39.800
The particle is going to basically move in that position space, bounce off the walls,

03:39.800 --> 03:41.160
and it never loses velocity.

03:41.160 --> 03:42.920
The energy is always constant.

03:42.920 --> 03:47.440
And we're going to keep track of its position here on the left, or on your left also, and

03:47.440 --> 03:49.400
the direction here on the right.

03:49.400 --> 03:53.400
So let's show what a one particle looks like, and you can see just bouncing off, and every

03:53.400 --> 03:56.760
time it bounces, the direction changes.

03:56.760 --> 04:01.400
Now we're going to play now this same game, but we're going to make 200 copies of that

04:01.400 --> 04:02.880
particle.

04:02.880 --> 04:06.480
Now these particles don't bounce off of each other, they don't interact, we're basically

04:06.480 --> 04:11.960
making 200 copies and all superimposing them on the same graph, and we're just going to

04:11.960 --> 04:14.160
watch how they behave.

04:14.160 --> 04:17.240
And the main difference is we're going to put all the particles initially at the same

04:17.240 --> 04:22.200
spot shown here, but we're going to make their directions ever so slightly different, maybe

04:22.200 --> 04:28.800
plus or minus a degree here, and then we're going to watch how the system evolves in time.

04:28.800 --> 04:31.860
So you can see the particles start kind of as a compact group, but every time they hit

04:31.860 --> 04:37.060
a curved surface, the groups begin to spread apart, and this continues, and we're going

04:37.060 --> 04:39.460
to watch this for a few minutes.

04:39.460 --> 04:43.020
And what you can notice here, this is actually one of the most famous effects in dynamical

04:43.020 --> 04:45.140
systems, known as the butterfly effect.

04:45.140 --> 04:49.180
You may have heard this from who talks about chaos theory, where if you have this complex

04:49.180 --> 04:53.420
system, and this doesn't seem particularly complex, but it's complex enough, and you

04:53.420 --> 05:00.020
start it with slightly different initial conditions, and you watch it later on in time, those trajectories

05:00.020 --> 05:01.900
will eventually diverge quite dramatically.

05:01.900 --> 05:06.460
And the famous example of this is a butterfly flapping its wings in Hong Kong might end

05:06.460 --> 05:12.500
up weeks later with a hurricane off the coast of Florida, whereas if it didn't flap its

05:12.500 --> 05:13.700
wings, that wouldn't have happened.

05:13.700 --> 05:17.420
That's kind of the popular science version of this, but in general, it just means this

05:17.420 --> 05:20.340
kind of very sensitive dependence on initial conditions.

05:20.340 --> 05:24.420
And what you can see here is from that initial point where all the particles were in the

05:24.420 --> 05:28.980
same spot with more or less the same direction, in other words, kind of an ordered system

05:28.980 --> 05:34.100
and we'll define that a little bit more quantitatively later on, we go to a situation where all

05:34.100 --> 05:41.060
the particles are now spread almost uniformly throughout the entire volume of the stadium

05:41.060 --> 05:47.220
and almost all possible directions are uniformly exhibited.

05:47.220 --> 05:51.140
So this is going to be crucial, but we want to kind of somehow quantify this, put this

05:51.140 --> 05:53.020
into, give it a number.

05:53.020 --> 05:57.340
So this is kind of going from an ordered to a disordered way, can we actually translate

05:57.340 --> 06:00.420
that into like a quantity.

06:00.420 --> 06:03.860
So to do that, we're going to add one more element to our game.

06:03.860 --> 06:06.780
We're going to create basically a grid of addresses.

06:06.780 --> 06:12.580
Think of this almost like regions on a map, you have demarcating longitude and latitude,

06:12.580 --> 06:17.820
but here we're going to have some addresses denoting position on the left and some addresses

06:17.820 --> 06:20.740
denoting direction on the right.

06:20.740 --> 06:23.660
Now here I've just divided everything into six sections for simplicity.

06:23.660 --> 06:26.740
I could do this into a million sections.

06:26.780 --> 06:33.420
The same concept still applies and at each time, while we're looking at the system, we

06:33.420 --> 06:35.660
can be at a particular, or the system is going to be a particular address.

06:35.660 --> 06:41.580
So for example here, the system at the initial time is in address 1D, because it's in region

06:41.580 --> 06:48.540
1 direction region D and at some later time it's going to be in some address which we'll

06:48.540 --> 06:54.580
call xy, but there's always going to be some address in which the system is at all times

06:54.620 --> 06:59.740
and in order to basically quantify this a little bit better, we're going to now, we're

06:59.740 --> 07:03.740
considering this ensemble, this 200 copies of the system, so we're going to basically

07:03.740 --> 07:09.300
define the fractions of that ensemble that are in particular addresses at particular

07:09.300 --> 07:10.300
times.

07:10.300 --> 07:15.180
So we're going to say the probability to be at a certain address xy at time t is basically

07:15.180 --> 07:18.740
going to be the fraction of all those systems at that address.

07:18.740 --> 07:24.380
Now this is going somewhere, it's not just mathematics for mathematics sake, because

07:24.380 --> 07:29.260
once we have that probability, we're going to, this is the final step, we're going to

07:29.260 --> 07:31.340
use it to calculate a number, right?

07:31.340 --> 07:33.980
And that's, so I'm going to show, there's going to be a few equations in the talk,

07:33.980 --> 07:38.740
I apologize, understanding it hopefully won't be based on, you know, you don't need to follow

07:38.740 --> 07:42.380
the equations too deeply, but this equation I really wanted to show because in some ways

07:42.380 --> 07:45.780
I'm going to argue it's one of the most beautiful equations in physics.

07:45.780 --> 07:49.660
And so what we've done here is we've taken that probability, we've summed, we've multiplied

07:49.660 --> 07:53.540
it by the logarithm of itself and summed over all the addresses.

07:53.540 --> 07:57.100
We multiply it by some unimportant constant out in front and that's the thing we call

07:57.100 --> 08:00.940
entropy, this mystical, important quantity in physics, that's it, that's all it is.

08:00.940 --> 08:06.140
It's just this looking at a system, dividing it up into addresses, calculating probabilities,

08:06.140 --> 08:07.300
getting a number out of it.

08:07.300 --> 08:11.660
And what we'll show later is that as a concept this is incredibly versatile because these

08:11.660 --> 08:16.380
addresses here are position and direction addresses, but they could be anything, in

08:16.380 --> 08:20.020
fact they could be chemical states and we'll show examples of that later.

08:20.020 --> 08:25.340
The originator of this equation, the first one to write it down is J.W. Gibbs.

08:25.340 --> 08:31.220
He was, someone called Einstein called him the greatest mind in American history.

08:31.220 --> 08:38.540
That might be, I'm not qualified to say that directly, he definitely arguably is among

08:38.540 --> 08:42.180
the or the greatest physicists in American history.

08:42.180 --> 08:45.860
Part of the beauty of this, of his work on thermodynamics in general in this equation

08:45.860 --> 08:48.980
in particular is it has such a long afterlife.

08:48.980 --> 08:54.580
So 50 years roughly after he wrote it down, Claude Shannon came across the same equation

08:54.580 --> 08:58.540
in information theory and more or less laid the foundations of our modern understanding

08:58.540 --> 09:02.180
of how information is processed in computer systems.

09:02.180 --> 09:08.780
So this is an equation with an extremely many, many different applications, but for us it's

09:08.780 --> 09:13.420
a number, a positive number and it's going to have a very simple kind of interpretation.

09:13.420 --> 09:18.940
So if all of our system is in one position on the map, so one region on the map, our

09:19.060 --> 09:22.140
entropy is zero.

09:22.140 --> 09:28.980
As the ensemble kind of covers more and more different regions, so we're going to color

09:28.980 --> 09:34.340
those with different shadings of orange, entropy grows.

09:34.340 --> 09:38.300
So initially entropy was zero, here now it's spread out a little bit, so entropy has grown

09:38.300 --> 09:45.060
to about 1.9 in this unit of K, here it's now almost uniformly spread throughout both

09:45.060 --> 09:48.340
in position and direction space, it's reached about 3.4.

09:48.380 --> 09:52.540
So think of it as just a measure of how much this probability spreads out.

09:52.540 --> 09:57.660
And we're going to now watch that same movie that we saw before, that ensemble kind of

09:57.660 --> 10:01.300
diverging because of this butterfly effect, but we're now going to keep track of that

10:01.300 --> 10:03.780
number as we're watching that.

10:03.780 --> 10:04.980
So this is what it looks like.

10:04.980 --> 10:09.300
So it's diverging initially, probability is more or less confined in a few regions, our

10:09.300 --> 10:15.380
entropy is small and then as time progresses entropy increases.

10:15.420 --> 10:19.780
Now it's a bit noisy here because we only did 200 copies, so if we had done this like

10:19.780 --> 10:24.980
a million times, a million copies we'd actually see a smooth increasing curve and as it increases

10:24.980 --> 10:30.420
it begins to kind of saturate and almost reach a maximum, and that maximum is also going

10:30.420 --> 10:34.180
to be important because that maximum essentially is the place where the probability is more

10:34.180 --> 10:38.780
or less uniformly distributed both in position and direction space.

10:38.780 --> 10:43.940
So I'm not going to wait until it completely reaches it, but this is what it looks like

10:43.940 --> 10:46.260
after you run it for a long time.

10:46.260 --> 10:50.340
And that maximum is then the second, like three equations in the talk, this is the second

10:50.340 --> 10:51.340
equation.

10:51.340 --> 10:56.620
Again, one of the most fundamental equations in physics, which is that maximum of entropy

10:56.620 --> 11:03.060
that it reaches is just K times the log of W, and W all it is is just a number of addresses

11:03.060 --> 11:04.060
in our map.

11:04.060 --> 11:09.860
So we had six position addresses, six direction addresses, so altogether 36 combinations, so

11:09.860 --> 11:13.620
it's just a log of 36, which is about 3.4.

11:13.620 --> 11:14.620
That's it.

11:14.620 --> 11:19.940
Now this equation is so important that Boltzmann or rather Boltzmann's probably immediate family

11:19.940 --> 11:23.380
or supporters had it carved into his gravestone.

11:23.380 --> 11:30.260
So it is literally a physics equation carved in stone, and it's probably the most famous

11:30.260 --> 11:35.820
version of entropy that people are familiar with, but keep in mind that it only applies

11:35.820 --> 11:37.740
at really long times, right?

11:37.740 --> 11:42.940
Once the system has basically uniformly distributed itself around all of position and direction

11:42.940 --> 11:44.460
space, and that's what we call equilibrium.

11:44.460 --> 11:48.620
But what I'm going to argue throughout the rest of the talk is somehow this initial part

11:48.620 --> 11:53.740
where entropy is rising is also incredibly important, and in some sense the Gibbs version,

11:53.740 --> 11:59.900
which gives us the entropy throughout, is the more fundamental thing to look at.

11:59.900 --> 12:06.780
So at this stage, we can kind of summarize what this little game has shown us by making

12:06.780 --> 12:07.780
a law, right?

12:07.780 --> 12:12.220
So this is our version of the second law of thermodynamics, which says that for an isolated

12:12.220 --> 12:16.020
system, so a system that does not interact with the environment, like our little Bunimovic

12:16.020 --> 12:22.540
stadium, billiards game, entropy increases over time until it reaches this maximum, given

12:22.540 --> 12:24.940
by the Boltzmann equation, all right?

12:24.940 --> 12:25.940
And it's a law, right?

12:25.940 --> 12:29.540
So you should definitely, definitely believe it, you know.

12:29.540 --> 12:32.220
And this is how I as an undergraduate always took it.

12:32.220 --> 12:37.300
People brought me laws, especially if they're literally carved in stone, right?

12:37.300 --> 12:38.980
You just, you know, you take it as a given.

12:38.980 --> 12:40.940
This is a law of nature.

12:40.940 --> 12:43.640
So is this, in fact, universally true?

12:43.640 --> 12:47.100
So I'm going to show you next, we'll perhaps shock you.

12:47.100 --> 12:51.100
I will violate the second law of thermodynamics right in front of your eyes.

12:51.100 --> 12:56.340
And I'm going to do this by just a very, very small change to our game, right?

12:56.340 --> 12:59.980
We had our Russian hockey stadium with curved edges.

12:59.980 --> 13:01.620
I'm going to make them straight, all right?

13:01.620 --> 13:04.220
So I'm going to look at tennis court.

13:04.220 --> 13:06.180
And let's see what happens.

13:06.180 --> 13:09.940
So here's the same game played in a rectangle, all right?

13:09.940 --> 13:13.940
Now, you can see the group of trajectories here, which started with slightly different

13:13.940 --> 13:18.780
initial conditions, is kind of spreading out, but definitely not as much as before.

13:18.780 --> 13:22.060
And in particular, look at direction space on the right.

13:22.060 --> 13:23.900
Direction space, you see that it's not spreading out at all.

13:23.900 --> 13:28.580
It's only really visiting four corners of that direction graph.

13:28.580 --> 13:31.740
Our entropy is increasing a little bit, but not so much.

13:31.740 --> 13:35.740
And in fact, if you run this forever, it will never, ever reach the Boltzmann equation.

13:35.740 --> 13:39.820
So that thing carved in stone is clearly not universally true.

13:39.820 --> 13:44.380
If you keep on running this a long time, it's going to kind of look like a 1980s screensaver.

13:44.380 --> 13:45.940
It's kind of mesmerizing.

13:45.940 --> 13:50.140
But it's surely not this kind of spreading out in all of position space that we saw before,

13:50.140 --> 13:52.260
where it almost looked like a gas, right?

13:52.260 --> 13:53.940
Spreading out through a volume.

13:53.940 --> 13:55.460
Here it's much more ordered, right?

13:55.460 --> 14:00.580
And that's clearly reflected by the fact that our entropy is much smaller, all right?

14:00.580 --> 14:04.540
So I think we're going to need a revision on our law.

14:04.540 --> 14:07.780
Terms and conditions may apply.

14:07.780 --> 14:14.700
And in fact, this is actually a subtle and difficult problem because this is, well, from

14:14.700 --> 14:19.860
the mathematician standpoint, this is enough to show that clearly this is not a universal

14:19.860 --> 14:25.420
law, but can it be shown for any systems?

14:25.420 --> 14:31.220
So it turns out that the only place where this law has been rigorously proven is for

14:31.220 --> 14:35.020
these kind of simple mathematical games like billiards.

14:35.020 --> 14:40.700
And Yakov Sinai, who was the first person to actually prove this for a billiards system,

14:40.700 --> 14:45.540
actually won what's the equivalent of a Nobel Prize in math, the 2014 Abel Prize for this

14:45.540 --> 14:46.540
proof.

14:46.540 --> 14:47.540
It's ridiculously hard.

14:47.540 --> 14:49.860
And that's for one particle bouncing around.

14:49.860 --> 14:51.540
It becomes even more difficult.

14:51.660 --> 14:56.140
Like, it's not even proven for a group of balls bouncing off of each other in a simple

14:56.140 --> 14:58.100
two-dimensional surface.

14:58.100 --> 14:59.500
So it's quite a difficult thing.

14:59.500 --> 15:01.980
What do you mean by an isolated system?

15:01.980 --> 15:06.060
So in this particular case, I mean a system that doesn't exchange energy or particles

15:06.060 --> 15:07.820
with its surroundings, right?

15:07.820 --> 15:11.060
So this is, I mean, later on we'll consider systems like biological systems where we're

15:11.060 --> 15:14.060
clearly sitting here, you know, this room is a certain temperature.

15:14.060 --> 15:19.860
We're constantly exchanging energy particles in the gas around us or bouncing off of us,

15:19.860 --> 15:21.780
passing us and taking energy away from us.

15:21.780 --> 15:23.820
So that's a more complicated scenario.

15:23.820 --> 15:28.820
So in this particular case, I mean a system that has no exchange of energy or particles

15:28.820 --> 15:30.980
or anything else with its surroundings.

15:30.980 --> 15:35.380
For both of those shapes, does the size of the shape matter?

15:35.380 --> 15:43.220
In other words, if the stadium was round or if it was higher and wider or in the square,

15:43.220 --> 15:46.300
if it was higher and wider, does that have anything to do with it?

15:46.300 --> 15:52.220
The absolute size of the shape doesn't matter except that circles are a bit different.

15:52.220 --> 15:57.780
So it does have to have this combination of straight and curved edges, but the actual dimensions

15:57.780 --> 15:59.380
of the shape don't matter too much.

15:59.380 --> 16:04.260
It'll matter in terms of how long it may take to equilibrate, but beyond that, the second

16:04.260 --> 16:07.060
law will hold for the curved stadium, yeah.

16:07.060 --> 16:10.380
Be, you know, again in the shape of the arena.

16:10.380 --> 16:15.820
For example, when you have a curved one and you've got objects ricocheting off of a curve,

16:15.820 --> 16:21.460
they have, you know, a bigger range of direction they can travel in when you hit a straight

16:21.460 --> 16:23.580
line or a flat surface.

16:23.580 --> 16:27.460
The angle of incidence equals the angle of deflection, yeah.

16:27.460 --> 16:31.780
So that's actually, you bring up a very interesting point because it turns out that in this particular

16:31.780 --> 16:35.940
shape, the way the dynamics are designed, the angle of incidence always does equal the

16:35.940 --> 16:40.380
angle of reflection, but you have to define the angle as kind of the tangent to the circle

16:40.380 --> 16:43.980
when you're doing the, when you're doing the kind of curved circular part.

16:43.980 --> 16:48.180
So it's basically the line that just touches, that just grazes the edge of the circle.

16:48.180 --> 16:50.300
And then it bounces off of that line.

16:50.300 --> 16:54.580
But what you bring up, which is actually is true, is that the behavior off curved surfaces

16:54.580 --> 16:56.980
is much different than the behavior of straight lines.

16:56.980 --> 17:00.060
And that's why in the rectangular case, you get much less divergence.

17:00.060 --> 17:06.260
So a little extra kind of, you know, the slight mathematical difference there is enough to

17:06.260 --> 17:08.180
create this divergence.

17:08.180 --> 17:10.860
But it's actually a really, it's a really subtle point, and it's not something that

17:10.860 --> 17:14.180
like you can, well, I'm gonna actually, I'm gonna say you can't generalize it, but I'm

17:14.180 --> 17:20.380
gonna literally just do that in the next slide, but it's very difficult to prove rigorously.

17:20.380 --> 17:23.620
And that's why it's kind of, you know, I mean, Yakov Sinai was one of these mathematicians

17:23.620 --> 17:27.260
who sat in the back of physics lectures and looked at what the physicists were saying

17:27.260 --> 17:29.100
and thought, like, this is just ridiculous.

17:29.100 --> 17:30.100
They're making so many assumptions.

17:30.100 --> 17:33.820
Let me go back to first principles and prove it, and then it took them like a career to

17:33.820 --> 17:35.660
prove one simple thing.

17:35.660 --> 17:40.460
What if the arena were shaped, say, like a hexagon or a pentagon?

17:40.540 --> 17:44.340
I think from, I have to double check this.

17:44.340 --> 17:48.780
I believe that any combination of straight edges would not give you chaos, but I would

17:48.780 --> 17:49.780
have to double check that.

17:49.780 --> 17:55.500
I haven't seen this game played in like polygons, but I think you do need to have these curved

17:55.500 --> 17:58.300
surfaces for this to work.

17:58.300 --> 17:59.820
Thank you for joining us.

17:59.820 --> 18:06.220
You've been watching Professor Mike Hynchefsky introducing the basic concepts of non-equilibrium

18:06.220 --> 18:07.540
thermodynamics.

18:07.540 --> 18:12.100
For more information on the Origins Science Scholars Program, please visit the institute's

18:12.100 --> 18:17.220
website at origins.case.edu.

18:17.220 --> 18:23.020
In the next part of the talk, Professor Hynchefsky will discuss entropy and the chemistry underlying

18:23.020 --> 18:24.020
life.

18:24.020 --> 18:26.580
Now, back to the talk.

18:26.580 --> 18:29.580
There is clearly something called the second law of thermodynamics, which we learn about

18:29.580 --> 18:37.420
in textbooks and which does exist, but in some ways it's kind of a leap of faith, right?

18:38.300 --> 18:41.420
What I want to kind of emphasize is, yes, we look at these shapes of the surfaces, but

18:41.420 --> 18:45.420
what really was the distinguished thing was one led to this kind of chaotic dynamics which

18:45.420 --> 18:49.580
was highly dependent on initial conditions, the other didn't.

18:49.580 --> 18:55.140
We believe, again, this very, very rough rule of thumb that complicated systems, meaning

18:55.140 --> 18:59.820
systems with lots and lots of particles like all of us and the universe around us, with

18:59.820 --> 19:04.020
strong interactions where particles bouncing off, interacting with each other through fundamental

19:04.060 --> 19:09.540
physical forces, that system taking an aggregate is indeed a chaotic system.

19:09.540 --> 19:12.980
And we, of course, we know that for things like weather systems, we see chaos all the

19:12.980 --> 19:13.980
time.

19:13.980 --> 19:19.140
And in particular, we think the entire universe, observable universe, falls in this category.

19:19.140 --> 19:24.540
And this is why we can talk about, at least as a kind of leap of faith, a second law for

19:24.540 --> 19:28.340
the universe, even though we can't rigorously mathematically prove it.

19:28.340 --> 19:32.020
Now one thing I wanted to do is an aside, and this is, again, I apologize to actual

19:32.020 --> 19:33.740
cosmologists in the audience.

19:33.740 --> 19:36.460
People love to talk about the entropy of the universe.

19:36.460 --> 19:39.060
What actually is it and what does it look like?

19:39.060 --> 19:44.420
So this is the best estimate that I could find, but it's going to, it looks like that.

19:44.420 --> 19:48.740
This is based on a paper from Egan and Lineweaver published a few years ago, and I wanted to

19:48.740 --> 19:52.140
convince you, it's a little bit different than our line, you know, entropy increasing

19:52.140 --> 19:58.460
over time in the stadium, but still same pattern, things increase over time.

19:58.460 --> 20:00.460
So this is, the time scale is a little bit different.

20:00.460 --> 20:04.980
You can notice this is like 10 to the minus 40, 10 to the minus 21, 10 to the 20.

20:04.980 --> 20:08.820
We're about 10 to the 17 seconds since the Big Bang.

20:08.820 --> 20:13.660
But overall, that entropy has increased by fairly large, you know, it kind of stays constant

20:13.660 --> 20:18.020
for a while and then has these huge increases over time, and we're right about here kind

20:18.020 --> 20:22.940
of on this final plateau before an extrapolated value where eventually the universe will end

20:22.940 --> 20:25.860
up in heat death and perfect equilibrium, right?

20:25.860 --> 20:27.740
That's the maximum over there.

20:27.740 --> 20:28.740
We're not there yet.

20:28.740 --> 20:31.540
We still have time to go, happily.

20:31.540 --> 20:34.740
Now what's really interesting about, I'm not going to talk about all the, what causes

20:34.740 --> 20:38.220
all these individual bumps, just kind of an aside, what's really interesting is if you

20:38.220 --> 20:44.740
have to guess what contributes the most to the entropy of the universe in the current

20:44.740 --> 20:47.380
moment, it's actually quite interesting.

20:47.380 --> 20:48.380
So here's our entropy.

20:48.380 --> 20:53.340
So 10 to the 104 in these units of K, and these are the contributions.

20:53.340 --> 20:55.660
So supermassive black holes.

20:55.660 --> 21:06.380
So these are the black holes that can be billions of times the mass of our sun, 99.999% a lot.

21:06.380 --> 21:07.620
What else contributes to the entropy?

21:07.620 --> 21:09.420
Oh, there's also smaller black holes.

21:09.420 --> 21:13.260
Those are in there about .0001%.

21:13.260 --> 21:17.900
And there's a bunch of other things, photons, you've got to add a bunch of zeros.

21:17.900 --> 21:21.420
And then there's a whole list in this paper, and eventually you'll get down to ordinary

21:21.420 --> 21:26.220
matter, including all of us in the audience here, and the rest of the stars and other

21:26.220 --> 21:27.220
matter in the universe.

21:27.220 --> 21:30.860
And that's our fraction of the total entropy.

21:30.860 --> 21:35.460
In a weird way, and again, something that's not the topic of this course, black holes

21:35.460 --> 21:40.460
dominate the entropy budget of the universe to a ridiculous extent.

21:40.460 --> 21:45.300
In fact, that recent black hole that you all saw in the news, that famous, the black hole

21:45.300 --> 21:48.540
picture, that's about 10 to the 95 K in entropy.

21:48.540 --> 21:55.700
If you, based on its extrapolated parameters, that has 100 trillion times more entropy.

21:55.700 --> 22:00.860
In other words, 100 trillion times more addresses living on the surface of that black hole than

22:00.860 --> 22:05.100
all the ordinary of the matter in the universe put together.

22:05.100 --> 22:10.140
So one way of looking at the issue of complexity in terms of the entropy, this second law says

22:10.140 --> 22:16.700
the entropy of the universe must always increase, is in some sense, all of us here are highly,

22:16.860 --> 22:21.100
highly irrelevant to the overall entropy budget of the universe.

22:21.100 --> 22:22.100
That cannot be said enough.

22:22.100 --> 22:27.460
I mean, in some sense, the fact that you have these stars burning for a few billion years,

22:27.460 --> 22:32.140
and you have some rocky planets circling those stars, and some chemical processes happening

22:32.140 --> 22:38.420
on those planets that lead to some kind of self-aware life, I mean, that's kind of like

22:38.420 --> 22:45.540
froth on a giant ocean, where the vast majority, the bulk of that ocean is living on the surface

22:45.580 --> 22:47.500
of black holes.

22:47.500 --> 22:52.380
So in some sense, what's happening with black holes dominates the entropy budget, and everything

22:52.380 --> 22:56.300
else is kind of like, you know, you can't even call it a rounding error, because this

22:56.300 --> 22:59.300
is like such a tiny, tiny fraction of it.

22:59.300 --> 23:02.140
Now, that's not quite the end of the story, right?

23:02.140 --> 23:05.900
Because in that sense, then we could say, well, anything goes, because, you know, at

23:05.900 --> 23:09.740
some level, like, the fact that we have, we lower our entropy state a little bit here,

23:09.740 --> 23:13.300
it doesn't really matter that much in terms of the universal entropy budget, but it's

23:13.300 --> 23:14.620
not quite that, right?

23:14.620 --> 23:18.660
Because in some sense, the second law doesn't just apply to the universe as a whole, it

23:18.660 --> 23:23.500
also applies to subsystems of the universe, and that's where we pay kind of the dues

23:23.500 --> 23:26.060
to the second law in everything that we do.

23:26.060 --> 23:29.820
All right, so how does the second law play out on smaller scale?

23:29.820 --> 23:33.620
So that was the end of our cosmology aside.

23:33.620 --> 23:38.060
To understand this kind of, you know, its implications on our scale, let's take a look

23:38.060 --> 23:39.060
at some snapshots.

23:39.060 --> 23:42.620
So we're going to go back to our game, and now we're going to look at, let's say the

23:42.620 --> 23:43.620
first 20 seconds, okay?

23:43.620 --> 23:47.260
So we're going to look at that movie again, first 20 seconds of it, while the entropy

23:47.260 --> 23:50.380
is increasing, let's watch, all right?

23:50.380 --> 23:55.460
So the thing kind of diverges, and then the movie will stop, all right?

23:55.460 --> 23:59.500
I'm going to show you a second version of that, and you can just shout out what you

23:59.500 --> 24:00.500
think is going on.

24:00.500 --> 24:07.340
So this is the second version of that.

24:07.340 --> 24:08.340
It's converging.

24:08.340 --> 24:09.340
What have I done?

24:09.340 --> 24:11.180
I'm playing, okay, yes.

24:11.180 --> 24:13.300
Obviously, it seems like I'm playing backwards.

24:13.300 --> 24:15.420
The answer is no.

24:15.420 --> 24:18.460
I'm almost doing that, and in fact, I'm getting the same result.

24:18.460 --> 24:22.860
What I've actually done is I've started in this configuration here, that was the configuration

24:22.860 --> 24:26.620
at 20 seconds, and all I've done is I've reversed all the velocities.

24:26.620 --> 24:30.540
So I basically, these were the old velocities here in pink, I've now just moved them across

24:30.540 --> 24:35.660
the other side of the circle, and just, you know, rearranged all the directions.

24:35.660 --> 24:39.940
And when you do that, everything just converges back to the beginning.

24:39.940 --> 24:41.940
It seems like it's going backwards in time, right?

24:41.940 --> 24:47.420
To us, psychologically, that's what seems to be happening, and in fact, this is actually

24:47.420 --> 24:50.940
true that for any physical system, you can actually reverse things, right?

24:50.940 --> 24:53.900
So people have actually just a few days ago that was in the news that people have managed

24:53.900 --> 24:55.380
to do this for several qubits.

24:55.380 --> 24:58.820
They more or less were able to have qubits evolve in time for a certain amount of time,

24:58.820 --> 25:04.580
do some complicated quantum mechanical manipulations, and those qubits, those little quantum particles,

25:04.580 --> 25:09.020
would then evolve backwards, kind of, they called them Benjamin Button, you know, qubits.

25:09.020 --> 25:12.860
Now, why did you think it was going backwards in time?

25:12.860 --> 25:17.180
Because to us, you know, our experience of the world, we know that there's a certain

25:17.180 --> 25:20.020
sequence of things that are more likely to happen versus the other.

25:20.020 --> 25:24.500
For example, we know that little babies grow up to be teenagers, grow up to be middle-aged

25:24.500 --> 25:28.380
people, grow up to eventually, you know, be older, and then eventually we die.

25:28.380 --> 25:29.700
That's, we see that all the time.

25:29.700 --> 25:34.740
We rarely see except in movies with Brad Pitt, you know, old people becoming infants,

25:34.740 --> 25:36.100
you know, and reverting back.

25:36.100 --> 25:41.220
Now it turns out that there's nothing inherently violating the laws of physics of having a

25:41.220 --> 25:42.740
Benjamin Button.

25:42.740 --> 25:45.100
It's just highly, highly unlikely.

25:45.100 --> 25:49.060
And this is one of the things that we, that kind of a consequence that we're going to

25:49.060 --> 25:53.820
try to emphasize about entropy increasing is that it means when entropy is increasing,

25:53.820 --> 25:57.020
certain sequences of events are much more likely to happen than others.

25:57.020 --> 26:01.060
So for example, that sequence when the, when the balls kind of diverge and bounce and become

26:01.060 --> 26:05.380
more disordered, that seems much more likely to you to occur than a sequence where everything

26:05.380 --> 26:06.380
converges.

26:06.380 --> 26:10.300
Even though it's possible to have all those velocities flipped and everything to go back

26:10.300 --> 26:13.700
to its initial part, it's just really, really hard to do that.

26:13.700 --> 26:17.780
And the more particles you have, the more statistically difficult it is to flip everything

26:17.780 --> 26:20.460
and have everything converge back to itself, right?

26:20.460 --> 26:25.220
So when entropy increases, there seems to be a preferred order of things, right?

26:25.220 --> 26:28.300
And we'll make that a quantitative in a little bit.

26:28.300 --> 26:32.760
Now I want to show you now just a contrast, a second snapshot, which is at the very end

26:32.760 --> 26:36.200
of the simulation when we're looking near equilibrium, all right?

26:36.200 --> 26:38.000
So this is going to be, I'm going to do the same game.

26:38.000 --> 26:42.200
So I'm going to play it for 20 seconds like that.

26:42.200 --> 26:45.520
And then, okay, it's bouncing around like a gas.

26:45.520 --> 26:48.840
I'm going to do the same thing, flip all the velocities, play it again.

26:48.840 --> 26:52.440
And there, if you look at it, you won't be able to tell which one, if I just showed you

26:52.440 --> 26:56.240
without telling you the difference, there's no way you can actually even tell statistically

26:56.240 --> 26:58.400
which one is going forwards, which one is going backwards.

26:58.400 --> 27:02.680
In fact, every sequence of events, when we've reached our maximum, when entropy no longer

27:02.720 --> 27:05.640
changes, is equally likely as any other.

27:05.640 --> 27:07.000
There's no preferred direction.

27:07.000 --> 27:11.320
So in a very real sense, in equilibrium, there is no arrow of time, right?

27:11.320 --> 27:18.200
This is the famous, if you may have heard of it in discussions of this topic, but this

27:18.200 --> 27:19.560
is what it boils down to, right?

27:19.560 --> 27:23.520
We don't see that arrow of time in an equilibrium system when entropy is not increasing.

27:23.520 --> 27:25.560
Okay, so let's make this a little quantitative.

27:25.560 --> 27:28.200
So this is kind of, I'm going to give you a little bit of flavor of some of the ways we

27:28.200 --> 27:31.960
think about entropy now, kind of a modern physics context.

27:31.960 --> 27:34.880
We can actually do this, play this game in terms of addresses.

27:34.880 --> 27:39.760
So we have one take, which is, we have a system that visits, you know, four addresses as

27:39.760 --> 27:40.960
it's evolving in time.

27:40.960 --> 27:45.480
We can ask, take two, the system visits those same addresses, but in reverse order.

27:45.480 --> 27:48.040
And we can play this, you know, we can run the simulations many times.

27:48.040 --> 27:53.120
You can ask, how often does that occur versus take, take one occur versus take two?

27:53.120 --> 27:57.520
And we can calculate the probabilities of those, of those sequences.

27:57.520 --> 28:01.480
If we take the ratio of them and then take the log of it, we get a number, which I'm

28:01.500 --> 28:03.000
going to call sigma.

28:03.000 --> 28:07.760
This sigma is actually in some ways our modern, the modern version of what Gibbs was doing.

28:07.760 --> 28:11.560
We actually now interpret that as essentially being an entropy of a sequence.

28:11.560 --> 28:15.240
So before I was talking about an entropy of an ensemble of many copies of a system, here

28:15.240 --> 28:19.680
we're actually defining entropy at the level of a sequence of states which we visit.

28:19.680 --> 28:23.360
And we, we interpret that as basically the amount by which the entropy of the universe

28:23.360 --> 28:27.440
has increased during that visiting the forward sequence of states.

28:27.440 --> 28:31.080
So if the entropy is not increasing, right, the probability of the top is the same as

28:31.080 --> 28:35.680
the bottom, that's one, right, the ratio is one, the log of one is zero, so entropy

28:35.680 --> 28:37.440
is not increased, that's consistent.

28:37.440 --> 28:40.680
And if one is much, much larger, much, much smaller than the other, then entropy is either

28:40.680 --> 28:44.240
large, very much increasing or decreasing during the sequence.

28:44.240 --> 28:47.880
So let me give you a concrete example of this, Humpty Dumpty, right?

28:47.880 --> 28:48.880
Everybody knows Humpty.

28:48.880 --> 28:53.920
This is a sequence of two events, Humpty is intact, Humpty falls, breaks, and according

28:53.920 --> 28:57.800
to the nursery rhyme, all the king's horses and all the king's men could not put Humpty

28:57.800 --> 28:59.920
back together again.

28:59.920 --> 29:05.360
But they, you know, Humpty could have spontaneously reassembled, again, not violating the laws

29:05.360 --> 29:07.760
of physics, highly, highly unlikely.

29:07.760 --> 29:12.400
But we can calculate the ratio, so Humpty falling, Humpty breaking versus Humpty reassembling,

29:12.400 --> 29:17.840
that number is like 10 to the 10 to the 20, that's a very, very large number.

29:17.840 --> 29:21.760
And how does that, you know, by converting it to entropy in the, in using the formula

29:21.760 --> 29:28.240
from the previous slide, that corresponds about, about 10 to the 20 K of entropy released

29:28.240 --> 29:29.240
into the universe.

29:29.240 --> 29:34.520
So the universe has crept up that much closer towards heat death by Humpty falling.

29:34.520 --> 29:40.960
Now here's then the crucial part for the next several, you know, slides of the talk.

29:40.960 --> 29:41.960
That's fine.

29:41.960 --> 29:44.560
So that's kind of, and this is, this is this law, this, this idea that I've shown you applies

29:44.560 --> 29:48.640
just as well for Humpty's subsystems, the living things, you know, it doesn't, it's

29:48.640 --> 29:52.000
a law that applies to subsystems as well as the whole universe.

29:52.000 --> 29:55.720
But how does the entropy of the universe increase when Humpty falls?

29:55.720 --> 30:00.600
And it turns out that this increase is just heat release, right?

30:00.600 --> 30:10.000
It's about 0.2 calories, so not a huge amount of heat, but that's, oh, are we, okay, yeah.

30:10.000 --> 30:15.320
So it's not a huge amount of heat release, but it's some amount of heat has been released

30:15.320 --> 30:17.760
into, into the, into the surroundings.

30:17.760 --> 30:20.760
And why does the universal entropy kind of increase there?

30:20.760 --> 30:23.880
Because when we give energy to the surroundings, the surroundings in some ways can explore

30:23.880 --> 30:31.280
more addresses, and hence the entropy of the universe as a whole is increasing, right?

30:31.280 --> 30:36.280
So that's going to be kind of crucial because this is how typically we pay our due to entropy

30:36.280 --> 30:42.480
as, you know, subsystems of the universe, we tend to release heat, dissipate heat, right?

30:42.480 --> 30:43.480
Okay.

30:44.480 --> 30:50.280
Let me give you a kind of a more down-to-earth example of this, where we are releasing heat.

30:50.280 --> 30:51.520
So this is a circuit, right?

30:51.520 --> 30:55.760
We attach a battery to a circuit, and, you know, a motor to that, to that circuit.

30:55.760 --> 30:59.360
There's some heat being dissipated.

30:59.360 --> 31:01.720
Now what's going on here, right?

31:01.720 --> 31:03.280
Why doesn't there need to be heat dissipated?

31:03.280 --> 31:08.240
Well, the electrons in that wire, if we didn't have the battery attached, would just be more

31:08.240 --> 31:10.560
or less moving in random directions, right?

31:10.560 --> 31:11.960
There would be no preferred direction.

31:11.960 --> 31:16.960
So one kind of sequence of electrons motion to the left would be equally probable to another

31:16.960 --> 31:20.160
sequence of electron motions to the right.

31:20.160 --> 31:24.520
But in when we have a current flowing through the system, one of those sequences becomes

31:24.520 --> 31:26.200
much more likely than the other, right?

31:26.200 --> 31:31.160
There's a preferred direction for the electrons to move through our wire.

31:31.160 --> 31:34.280
Based on the argument that I just showed you, because there's now this preferred sequence

31:34.280 --> 31:39.040
of states which the system visits, the entropy of the universe must increase.

31:39.040 --> 31:40.040
How does it increase?

31:40.040 --> 31:42.800
Well, heat has to be dissipated, right?

31:42.800 --> 31:44.960
Okay, heat is a form of energy.

31:44.960 --> 31:46.600
It's being released into the environment.

31:46.600 --> 31:47.600
Where does that energy come from?

31:47.600 --> 31:49.520
There must be an energy source, right?

31:49.520 --> 31:50.720
That's why you have to have a battery.

31:50.720 --> 31:56.240
So in a weird way, in this kind of inverted thermodynamic perspective, I argue the existence

31:56.240 --> 32:02.600
of the battery by the fact that first there's a symmetry breaking in the motion of the electrons.

32:02.600 --> 32:06.840
But for me, that heat, that we take it for granted, you know, we plug things in, you

32:06.840 --> 32:10.400
know, our electronics are all heated up, things like that.

32:10.400 --> 32:17.080
That kind of very mundane aspect of our daily lives is, in fact, all the objects around

32:17.080 --> 32:19.360
us are paying to the second law of thermodynamics.

32:19.360 --> 32:23.280
So this heat dissipation is essentially the entropy price because those electrons are

32:23.280 --> 32:26.440
moving in a preferred direction.

32:26.440 --> 32:29.260
Because there's this other law of thermodynamics which I have not emphasized, called the first

32:29.260 --> 32:34.800
law, more or less the energy conservation, the power in minus the power out is equal

32:34.800 --> 32:36.120
to the power dissipated, right?

32:36.120 --> 32:41.280
So you have to have more power in than power out in order to have dissipated heat, right?

32:41.280 --> 32:45.400
So you have to have an energy source that's larger than the power that the motor is using.

32:45.400 --> 32:51.080
All right, this is a much more concise way of explaining this.

32:51.080 --> 32:52.640
This is stupid.

32:52.640 --> 32:55.480
Don't do this.

32:55.480 --> 33:02.480
Those electrons in that wire are not going to spontaneously begin moving around in a circle

33:02.480 --> 33:05.640
because there's no power source.

33:05.640 --> 33:07.240
Okay.

33:07.240 --> 33:11.200
So now let's now switch gears a little bit.

33:11.200 --> 33:17.040
So everything that I've talked so far have been addresses that have lived, positions

33:17.040 --> 33:23.040
and directions, positions and directions of electrons or particles and stadium.

33:23.040 --> 33:25.720
The power of this concept is that address could be anything.

33:25.720 --> 33:29.240
It could be a chemical, it could be a step in a chemical cycle.

33:29.240 --> 33:32.920
So this is one of these famous cycles that if you have memories of high school biology,

33:32.920 --> 33:36.360
probably brings you back some nightmares of memorization.

33:36.360 --> 33:39.960
We're not going to go through the details of these kind of metabolic cycles, but note

33:39.960 --> 33:44.040
that whenever the people draw these cycles, always the arrows primarily in one direction.

33:44.040 --> 33:45.040
Why?

33:45.040 --> 33:46.280
Because that's how it happens in our bodies.

33:46.280 --> 33:49.760
It primarily goes in one direction rather than the other.

33:49.760 --> 33:50.760
What does that mean?

33:50.760 --> 33:53.640
It means that we have now a sequence of states more likely to go in one direction than the

33:53.640 --> 33:54.640
other.

33:54.640 --> 33:56.400
Well, we've got to pay our due to the second law.

33:56.400 --> 33:58.240
That means heat has to be dissipated, right?

33:58.240 --> 34:04.120
So there's going to be some necessary entropic price to pay.

34:04.120 --> 34:10.040
So let me give you kind of one very famous example of such a cycle.

34:10.040 --> 34:12.280
So this is the ATP synthase protein.

34:12.280 --> 34:17.720
So this is a protein that essentially synthesizes this energy molecule called ATP, which then

34:17.720 --> 34:21.000
runs a lot of the other biological processes in our body.

34:21.000 --> 34:26.800
And those biological processes degrade that energy molecule back into ATP and phosphate.

34:26.800 --> 34:28.520
And this protein actually spins around.

34:28.520 --> 34:33.360
It's kind of this interesting rotor complex, and it spins around primarily in one direction

34:33.360 --> 34:38.640
so long as you have an imbalance of ions on one side of a membrane versus the other.

34:38.640 --> 34:47.360
In that previous work where you were bouncing the particles around the racetrack, just as

34:47.360 --> 34:53.880
a problem, I would ask what would happen if the racetrack was elliptical and you started

34:53.880 --> 34:56.640
out at one focus of the ellipse?

34:56.640 --> 35:00.480
I don't think there would be chaos.

35:00.480 --> 35:07.840
I have not explored all possible shapes, but I do think if ellipses were, I would have

35:07.840 --> 35:09.520
heard about it in some ways.

35:09.520 --> 35:12.400
Like it requires a particular combinations of shapes.

35:12.400 --> 35:19.760
An array of light that goes through one focus will wind up at the other focus.

35:19.760 --> 35:23.720
So that would argue against the fact that things are going to become disordered inside

35:23.720 --> 35:26.040
that ellipse.

35:26.040 --> 35:30.200
But I think it would not become disordered in the same way.

35:30.200 --> 35:32.600
I may have missed this.

35:32.600 --> 35:33.600
Excuse me.

35:33.600 --> 35:37.440
What is the actual definition of the word entropy?

35:37.440 --> 35:43.040
So used in this talk, and I wanted to be kind of very clear so that there isn't this confusion.

35:43.040 --> 35:50.200
The definition of entropy is this thing here in the blue box.

35:50.200 --> 35:57.360
So you take a system, you divide it up into a state space, addresses which denote the states

35:57.360 --> 35:58.360
of the system.

35:58.360 --> 36:02.200
You have probabilities associated with being at a particular address at a certain time.

36:02.200 --> 36:06.440
You take those probabilities, you multiply them by the logarithm, you add them all up.

36:06.440 --> 36:07.440
That's entropy.

36:07.440 --> 36:09.440
Could you give me a sentence?

36:09.440 --> 36:12.000
A sentence, okay.

36:12.000 --> 36:17.760
So the less mathematical definition would be, it would be a measure of how spread out

36:17.760 --> 36:20.080
that probability is, how disordered the system is.

36:20.080 --> 36:23.440
How disordered the problem is.

36:23.440 --> 36:27.480
How spread out the probability is, which you can interpret in a way as how disordered

36:27.480 --> 36:28.720
the system is.

36:28.720 --> 36:32.580
Because the more spread out you are, the more addresses you live in, the more different

36:32.580 --> 36:36.040
combinations are possible that you see in the system.

36:36.040 --> 36:39.080
So when entropy is zero, everything lives at one address.

36:39.080 --> 36:44.600
When entropy is large, everything is, all addresses are equally likely to occur.

36:44.600 --> 36:47.680
And there's a roof to help for how I...

36:47.680 --> 36:48.680
Exactly.

36:48.680 --> 36:49.680
Right?

36:49.680 --> 36:53.080
So if this was a completely empty city and all of us sitting here in the audience were

36:53.080 --> 36:57.480
in this particular room, and let's say we divided up the city into boxes of the side

36:57.480 --> 37:00.840
of this room, the entropy of our population would be zero.

37:00.840 --> 37:05.400
But then if you guys all went out and equally like uniformly spread out throughout all of

37:05.400 --> 37:10.880
the Cleveland area so that there was a uniform population density of you everywhere, then

37:10.880 --> 37:12.200
your entropy would be maximum.

37:12.200 --> 37:15.680
That would be the most disordered that you could become.

37:15.680 --> 37:17.520
And it's different for different systems.

37:17.520 --> 37:19.040
It's completely different for different systems.

37:19.040 --> 37:22.040
Even in the notion of what an address is, that's why I kind of use this word address.

37:22.040 --> 37:25.240
I mean, in physics we call it phase space, but that's more technical.

37:25.240 --> 37:29.000
But like what I'm claiming is that this idea of addresses works just as well in chemistry

37:29.000 --> 37:32.320
as it does for actual physical positions.

37:32.320 --> 37:38.080
We hope you've been enjoying the Origin Science Scholars Program with Professor Michael Hynchewski.

37:38.080 --> 37:43.120
Professor Hynchewski is the Warren E. Ropp assistant professor in the Department of Physics

37:43.120 --> 37:48.400
at Case Western Reserve University, specializing in theoretical biophysics.

37:48.400 --> 37:54.760
In the second part of our talk, we learned how life is a cascade of energy conversion

37:54.760 --> 37:56.720
and dissipation.

37:56.720 --> 38:01.800
In our final segment, Professor Hynchewski will talk about thermodynamics and the origin

38:01.800 --> 38:02.800
of life.

38:02.800 --> 38:05.640
Now, back to our talk.

38:05.640 --> 38:10.520
So if you take a, you know, again, comparing or going back to this comparison with a battery,

38:10.520 --> 38:13.020
it seems like a very, very different system, right?

38:13.020 --> 38:16.800
So we have, but when I argue it's not that much different, right?

38:16.800 --> 38:21.740
So on one hand we have a system that's kind of, has some preferred direction, right?

38:21.740 --> 38:26.900
Here it's the mode, it's the proteins, you know, preferably going in one direction.

38:26.900 --> 38:29.860
Here it was the electrons preferably going in one direction around the wire.

38:29.860 --> 38:33.340
We have some process that's going on where energy is being utilized.

38:33.340 --> 38:34.740
Here it's the synthesis of ATP.

38:34.740 --> 38:38.340
Here it's the motor turning.

38:38.340 --> 38:40.140
We have some power source.

38:40.140 --> 38:41.140
Here it's a battery.

38:41.140 --> 38:43.700
This was just such a chemical potential energy.

38:43.700 --> 38:48.140
Here that battery is in something, the imbalance of ions on one side of the membrane versus

38:48.140 --> 38:49.300
the other.

38:49.300 --> 38:53.100
And as a necessary sort of consequence of the second law of thermodynamics, heat has to

38:53.100 --> 38:54.100
be released.

38:54.100 --> 38:57.660
There has to be some amount of loss of energy through heat.

38:57.660 --> 39:01.380
Now if you let both of these systems run indefinitely, what would happen?

39:01.380 --> 39:03.700
Well, your battery would become depleted.

39:03.700 --> 39:05.100
It would go to equilibrium, right?

39:05.100 --> 39:07.420
The electrons would stop moving in a preferred direction.

39:07.420 --> 39:10.620
Here if you kept on running this thing forever, eventually this, there would be the equal

39:10.620 --> 39:13.900
number of ions on one side of the membrane versus the other.

39:13.900 --> 39:18.820
And now your protein would begin to have, it would still kind of move, but in random

39:18.820 --> 39:21.020
ways and not with a preferred direction.

39:21.020 --> 39:23.500
So basically your battery would become depleted.

39:23.500 --> 39:27.380
So what happens in nature is, well, in our case, sometimes you switch out the batteries,

39:27.380 --> 39:29.780
maybe it's a rechargeable battery, we can recharge it.

39:29.780 --> 39:33.460
In nature we pump out, we pump those ions continuously back out, right?

39:33.460 --> 39:38.460
How that pumping occurs differs from organism to organism.

39:38.460 --> 39:43.340
And in our case, it's we ingest food and some of that energy is being converted into pumping

39:43.340 --> 39:45.700
out those ions.

39:45.700 --> 39:47.980
Let me give you one kind of very simple example.

39:47.980 --> 39:54.860
This is from a simple bacterium where that pumping occurs because of another protein called

39:54.860 --> 39:57.020
bacteria rhodopsin on the membrane.

39:57.020 --> 40:02.340
And it basically interacts with photons from sunlight and uses that energy from the photons

40:02.340 --> 40:08.060
to basically drive its own cycle of pumping where it pumps those ions back out.

40:08.060 --> 40:10.500
On the other side of the membrane, then you have an imbalance form.

40:10.500 --> 40:16.460
That imbalance then is used to power this ATP synthase to basically produce the ATP,

40:16.460 --> 40:18.540
then that drives other biological processes, right?

40:18.540 --> 40:23.300
And this is one particular example, but in some ways everything that we know about life

40:23.300 --> 40:25.780
is kind of built on kind of these nested cycles, right?

40:25.780 --> 40:28.340
So I'm going to kind of draw it like this, right?

40:28.340 --> 40:31.300
So you might have some fundamental energy source on top.

40:31.300 --> 40:33.140
In this case, it was a photon.

40:33.140 --> 40:36.300
That energy source powered a cycle which created a certain imbalance.

40:36.740 --> 40:41.180
In this case, it was an ion gradient, so more ions on one side of the membrane to the other.

40:41.180 --> 40:45.380
That ion gradient, that imbalance, in turn then powered a different imbalance, right?

40:45.380 --> 40:50.180
Another cycle primarily in one direction of the ATP synthase protein, which then in turns

40:50.180 --> 40:54.820
powers other cycles driven primarily in one direction, all of our metabolic cycles and

40:54.820 --> 40:56.940
cell division, things like this.

40:56.940 --> 41:01.940
At every step, because we are driving things primarily in one direction, so we're breaking

41:01.940 --> 41:05.900
the symmetry, we have to pay our dues to the second law.

41:05.900 --> 41:07.500
So we have to dissipate energy.

41:07.500 --> 41:11.780
We have to, there has to be some heat release at every single step of the process.

41:11.780 --> 41:15.500
So note that because of energy conservation, that means the energy available to all the

41:15.500 --> 41:18.140
lower tiers becomes progressively lower and lower and lower.

41:18.140 --> 41:20.620
We're wasting energy all throughout.

41:20.620 --> 41:23.460
But that waste is not somehow a bad thing.

41:23.460 --> 41:25.140
It's what makes us living, right?

41:25.140 --> 41:27.540
Because without that waste, there wouldn't be this broken symmetry.

41:27.540 --> 41:32.460
We wouldn't have our cycles going around primarily in one direction.

41:32.540 --> 41:38.540
So in fact, you sitting here, all of us, are releasing about 100 watts of power, which

41:38.540 --> 41:41.820
is the old, this is not an audience where I have to remind people of what incandescent

41:41.820 --> 41:46.340
light bulbs are, but to my students I may have to do that.

41:46.340 --> 41:52.660
But I mean, it's about the power of an old fashioned, now old fashioned light bulb.

41:52.660 --> 41:58.580
So that 100 watts of power releasing into the atmosphere, that is in some sense the indicator

41:58.580 --> 42:03.260
of all the non-equilibrium thermodynamic processes going on inside of our bodies, all the biochemical

42:03.260 --> 42:05.860
cycles being primarily driven in one direction.

42:05.860 --> 42:12.220
The net result of that is this 100 watts that we're releasing out into the atmosphere.

42:12.220 --> 42:16.580
So that was one thing, one particular organism.

42:16.580 --> 42:17.980
How does it happen for others?

42:17.980 --> 42:21.780
Well, it turns out that from this kind of cascade, there are two parts that are really

42:21.780 --> 42:25.660
universal to all known life that we see around us.

42:25.660 --> 42:30.540
One is the ion gradient of some kind, the other is ATP as this energy molecule, as this

42:30.540 --> 42:31.540
currency.

42:31.540 --> 42:37.420
What drives the ion gradient is now, in modern living organisms, is not universal anymore.

42:37.420 --> 42:42.660
In some cases here it was a photon, in us it's ingesting of other material.

42:42.660 --> 42:47.260
For bacteria living near hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the ocean, might be some

42:47.260 --> 42:52.060
chemical sources which drive this.

42:52.060 --> 42:56.780
So that becomes that first step in the top part of the cascade is no longer universal.

42:56.780 --> 43:00.780
And of course, the things that we do with ATP differ from different organisms, so that's

43:00.780 --> 43:02.780
no longer universal.

43:02.780 --> 43:06.940
But in some sense, if we're trying to think of this as these nested chemical cycles where

43:06.940 --> 43:13.740
one thing, one imbalance drives another, dissipating heat along the way, ultimately speaking, tracing

43:13.740 --> 43:19.020
this evolutionary history back to the beginning of time, there had to be some fundamental original

43:19.020 --> 43:25.980
imbalance that drove the first glimmers, the first echoes of these kind of cycles forward.

43:25.980 --> 43:31.900
Where things were driven out of an equilibrium state to primarily go into one direction.

43:31.900 --> 43:35.860
And on earth it turns out that if you do this kind of detective work, going forensically,

43:35.860 --> 43:41.140
going back in time, everything that we see around us, that's interesting in some sense.

43:41.140 --> 43:46.500
All things that are not in equilibrium, so air currents, ocean currents, plate tectonics,

43:46.500 --> 43:48.180
all the chemical cycles in life.

43:48.180 --> 43:52.700
And I'm trying to argue that mathematically we can lump all of these things together as

43:52.700 --> 43:59.140
being different versions of the symmetry is broken, where things are going around in currents.

43:59.140 --> 44:05.100
All of these have to be traced back to two fundamental imbalances.

44:05.100 --> 44:11.260
And those are the fact that we're sitting next to a star which is bombarding us with

44:11.260 --> 44:18.980
photons, beautiful source, they're transient on the scale of billions of years of energy

44:18.980 --> 44:20.500
that can drive imbalances.

44:20.500 --> 44:26.020
The other is geological, the fact that there's heat released as the core of the earth kind

44:26.020 --> 44:27.020
of solidifies.

44:27.020 --> 44:32.220
There are radioactive elements in the mantle that are decaying which provides heat.

44:32.220 --> 44:36.420
So kind of geological and solar are really our two sources.

44:36.420 --> 44:41.940
And unsurprisingly, there are two major camps in the origins of life field.

44:41.940 --> 44:48.420
People who think that maybe life emerged in kind of like shallow surface lakes exposed

44:48.420 --> 44:54.780
to sunlight, or people who think that maybe life emerged in deep ocean hydrothermal events.

44:54.780 --> 44:58.340
Where we kind of have this clear division between these two imbalances, then of course

44:58.340 --> 45:00.020
there could be combinations of the two.

45:00.020 --> 45:04.700
You can have shallow surface lakes at Yellowstone or Yellowstone like things where there's some

45:04.700 --> 45:07.660
kind of geothermal aspects to it as well.

45:07.660 --> 45:12.620
But the field kind of breaks into two camps and can we use thermodynamics in some sense

45:12.620 --> 45:17.620
to kind of maybe give an edge to one camp versus the other.

45:17.620 --> 45:23.660
And again, I'm not going to say anything definitive, so this is still an ongoing question and there

45:23.660 --> 45:27.620
are mechanisms by which both origins might work.

45:27.620 --> 45:31.900
But this is actually, this is a kind of complicated graph, but let me walk you through it.

45:31.900 --> 45:34.020
On the horizontal axis, think of this as energy.

45:34.020 --> 45:39.340
And this is energy now measured here in terms of units of milli-electron volts.

45:39.340 --> 45:43.380
It doesn't really matter what the units are, but from low to high.

45:43.380 --> 45:47.900
And here we also see the corresponding energies of photons, where visible photons, the light

45:47.900 --> 45:52.140
from the visible spectrum part of light is about this range of energies.

45:52.140 --> 45:57.060
Above that is the so-called ultraviolet part of the electromagnetic spectrum.

45:57.060 --> 46:02.860
Here in this green range are energies typically associated with biochemical processes, like

46:02.860 --> 46:05.420
for example ATP hydrolysis, things like this.

46:05.420 --> 46:06.780
This is membrane potential energy.

46:06.780 --> 46:11.100
So they live in this kind of infrared range of the spectrum.

46:11.100 --> 46:15.900
On the bottom of this graph are ranges of energies available from certain sources.

46:15.900 --> 46:20.140
So here in blue is water heated up to its critical temperature, beyond which it is no

46:20.140 --> 46:21.980
longer liquid in some sense.

46:21.980 --> 46:28.340
Here is like the energies available from like lava, like molten rock at really high temperatures.

46:28.340 --> 46:34.220
This orange curve is the energy available from the sun, the solar spectrum.

46:34.220 --> 46:39.660
And out here at really much higher things are basically intermittent strikes of lightning.

46:39.660 --> 46:44.900
Now if we think about this kind of range of sources, you can say, well look, molten rock,

46:44.900 --> 46:50.020
water temperatures, high water temperatures, they do kind of give us, get us within the

46:50.020 --> 46:53.740
ballpark of what we see as biochemical energies.

46:53.740 --> 46:57.660
But then if we consider now what I've tried to argue over the last few slides, the fact

46:57.660 --> 47:01.540
that we do have to pay this due to a second law, there has to be dissipation.

47:01.540 --> 47:06.780
So your energy input has to be larger than what you're using the energy for.

47:06.780 --> 47:11.180
We would in principle want to gravitate to like the largest persistent source of energy

47:11.180 --> 47:13.060
available to us.

47:13.060 --> 47:18.380
And that's pretty much the UV part of the spectrum of photons from the sun.

47:18.380 --> 47:23.500
Those are kind of the highest energy sources that are constantly available to us, bombarding

47:23.500 --> 47:28.340
us all the time, and basically have the largest allowance, the largest gap between that amount

47:28.340 --> 47:34.380
of energy and the energy that we're using for biological processes.

47:34.380 --> 47:39.180
And this in some sense is then the thermodynamic argument for why a photon-based, a light-based

47:39.180 --> 47:41.380
origin of life is more plausible.

47:41.380 --> 47:43.780
Again, it's not the final word.

47:43.780 --> 47:46.460
This is definitely not a closed book.

47:46.660 --> 47:52.140
Also a very high energy source, but I would argue probably too intermittent unless somebody's

47:52.140 --> 47:58.980
willing to argue that the early earth atmosphere was lightning all the time.

47:58.980 --> 48:01.980
But photons certainly are there.

48:01.980 --> 48:05.060
And the other part of the thing, which is actually kind of very exciting because the

48:05.060 --> 48:09.180
field has actually really blossomed in the last two years, there is now developments

48:09.180 --> 48:13.220
in chemistry that support this notion.

48:13.220 --> 48:17.900
So in particular, there's been work by Jack Sostak at Harvard, and this is John Southerl

48:17.900 --> 48:20.180
in Cambridge.

48:20.180 --> 48:25.020
And what they were able to finally show in the last few years is a 2015 paper, is now

48:25.020 --> 48:29.980
there is a plausible chemistry that we can associate to making the basic elements of

48:29.980 --> 48:30.980
life.

48:30.980 --> 48:34.780
So lipids, which are the containers, the things that make up cell membranes, amino acids,

48:34.780 --> 48:40.180
which are the bases of our proteins, things like RNA, nucleotides for genetic material.

48:40.180 --> 48:47.860
All of these can be synthesized under what the field considers plausible conditions similar

48:47.860 --> 48:53.540
to early earth, and critically, the catalyst here is ultraviolet light.

48:53.540 --> 48:59.420
So there seems to be in some ways this, again, this is a plausibility argument.

48:59.420 --> 49:04.580
It's not a definitive thing, but we can say, UV light is then, thermodynamically speaking,

49:04.580 --> 49:06.900
the most attractive option for an origin of life.

49:06.900 --> 49:12.820
And now we have a plausible chemistry driven by UV light that can actually lead to the

49:12.820 --> 49:15.220
synthesis of these types of living materials.

49:15.220 --> 49:18.900
Again, is this the actual chemistry that occurred in earlier life?

49:18.900 --> 49:24.820
We will probably never know that for certain, but these are different pieces of the puzzle

49:24.820 --> 49:27.700
that we're putting together.

49:27.700 --> 49:31.060
So we're coming towards the end of the talk.

49:31.060 --> 49:38.060
So what I want to emphasize at the end is, again, we think of chemistry and all these

49:38.060 --> 49:42.340
other things like hurricanes to be really two very, very different things.

49:42.340 --> 49:45.700
What I want to argue is that they're really truly connected to each other in this deep

49:45.700 --> 49:53.580
mathematical way through the notion of entropy, and that all these processes are all connected

49:53.580 --> 49:56.060
through non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

49:56.060 --> 50:00.740
And it's kind of the line of argument that I tried to make tonight is something along

50:00.740 --> 50:01.740
the following.

50:01.740 --> 50:06.580
So if you see a current, if you see this symmetry breaking where a certain sequence of events

50:06.580 --> 50:11.140
is more likely than the reverse, that necessarily implies there has to be some entropy increase

50:11.140 --> 50:12.580
in the universe.

50:12.580 --> 50:17.460
That entropy increase typically occurs through dissipation of heat into the environment.

50:17.460 --> 50:20.860
OK, if heat is dissipated into the environment, what does that mean?

50:20.860 --> 50:27.260
That means it requires a persistent power input, because you're losing energy, so that

50:27.260 --> 50:32.820
energy has to be coming from something, and this is more or less what the kind of conceptual

50:32.820 --> 50:34.940
framework what it boils down to.

50:34.940 --> 50:39.860
What's interesting is this will apply just as well to exoplanets as it does to Earth.

50:39.860 --> 50:45.420
These are universal aspects of what we understand to be laws of physics, and so any mechanism

50:45.420 --> 50:52.740
we think of life arising anywhere else still has to obey these basic thermodynamic ideas.

50:52.740 --> 50:58.820
And I just to kind of wrap up, this particular notion is kind of interwoven cascades of chemical

50:58.820 --> 51:03.900
cycles where you start with like a photon on top and then, you know, dissipate energy

51:03.900 --> 51:04.900
throughout.

51:04.900 --> 51:09.500
I was discussing this in one of my classes, and a colleague, Robin Snyder, was a theoretical

51:09.500 --> 51:10.500
ecologist.

51:10.500 --> 51:14.620
She pointed out this beautiful, beautiful quote from Primo Levy, which summarizes this much,

51:14.620 --> 51:16.700
much better and more eloquently than I could.

51:16.700 --> 51:20.020
This is from a short story of his called Carbon, which I highly recommend.

51:20.020 --> 51:22.140
Just go Google it and read it.

51:22.140 --> 51:26.700
And the way he described it is like this, such as life and inserting itself, a drawing

51:26.700 --> 51:32.180
off to its advantage, a parasitizing of the downward course of energy from its noble solar

51:32.180 --> 51:35.180
form to the degraded one of low temperature heat.

51:35.180 --> 51:40.900
In this downward course, which leads to equilibrium and thus death, life draws a bend and nests

51:40.900 --> 51:41.900
in it.

51:41.900 --> 51:46.620
And I think that beautifully kind of encapsulates in some ways the transient nature of all this,

51:46.620 --> 51:47.620
right?

51:47.620 --> 51:50.780
Because remember, as, you know, we're arguing here that entropy is increasing.

51:50.780 --> 51:55.300
All of this depends on this entropy increase that can only go on for so long, right?

51:55.300 --> 51:59.180
So all these beautiful things that we see, all these beautiful patterns, these complicated

51:59.180 --> 52:03.660
structures, inherent in their physics is, of course, their transience and their eventual

52:03.660 --> 52:05.160
death through equilibrium.

52:05.160 --> 52:10.020
So in some ways, like, you know, we're, you know, it's kind of a mixed blessing.

52:10.020 --> 52:12.700
We have all these beautiful things, but they won't last forever.

52:12.700 --> 52:17.780
Do you see ATP in viruses, in prions?

52:17.780 --> 52:23.980
So viruses basically are just kind of protein capsids incorporating genetic material.

52:23.980 --> 52:27.500
So in order to actually copy themselves, they have to insert themselves into a host like

52:27.500 --> 52:31.460
a bacterium, for example, and they use the machinery, the metabolic machinery of the

52:31.460 --> 52:33.100
host to make the copy.

52:33.100 --> 52:34.100
Yeah.

52:34.100 --> 52:40.220
Well, I mean, the virus in itself just sitting there is not, you know, you know, if there's

52:40.220 --> 52:44.340
no active biochemical cycle there, I wouldn't call that life.

52:44.340 --> 52:47.860
Once it's inserted there, it becomes a component of active biochemical cycles, and then in

52:47.860 --> 52:50.220
some sense, it becomes a part of a living thing.

52:50.220 --> 52:58.060
So do you come down on the metabolism first versus, you know, a nucleic acid or a brain?

52:58.060 --> 52:59.060
Yes.

52:59.060 --> 53:03.820
So part of, okay, so again, this is more kind of, you know, I'm a physicist, not a chemist,

53:03.820 --> 53:09.460
but I think part of what this kind of work that I showed here is arguing is in some sense

53:09.460 --> 53:13.460
the answer to the, you know, which came first, the chicken and the egg is both.

53:14.220 --> 53:19.780
That you can have a chemistry where all the various elements that you need can arise more

53:19.780 --> 53:24.460
or less simultaneously, and that in some sense seems the most plausible case because it's

53:24.460 --> 53:30.420
really hard to think of, you know, containers containing nothing, you know, things that

53:30.420 --> 53:34.620
need to be replicated like genetic material without the mechanisms, you know, the machinery

53:34.620 --> 53:35.900
to replicate them, right?

53:35.900 --> 53:40.540
So in some sense, you kind of would like as, you know, in something as an Occam's razor

53:40.540 --> 53:44.500
kind of most simplest thing, that somehow these, all things more or less arose around

53:44.500 --> 53:45.500
the same time.

53:45.500 --> 53:48.620
Again, whether there could be more complicated mechanisms by which you have one thing existing

53:48.620 --> 53:50.140
right before the other.

53:52.860 --> 53:57.420
The Origins Science Scholars Lectures are presented by Case Western Reserve University's

53:57.420 --> 54:01.580
Institute for the Science of Origins with the assistance of the Segal Lifelong Learning

54:01.580 --> 54:06.020
Program, the College of Arts and Sciences, and MediaVision.

54:06.020 --> 54:09.780
