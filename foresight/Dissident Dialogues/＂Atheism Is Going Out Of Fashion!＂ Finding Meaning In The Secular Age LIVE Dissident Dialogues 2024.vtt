WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Is it secularism or is it just a loss of narrative?

00:04.000 --> 00:08.000
If we'd have gotten rid of the God stuff, but kept this real attachment,

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
I mean, people often quote or used to quote the founding fathers of this nation

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
as if they were quoting Hadiths of the Prophet Muhammad.

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
Like, they've just, like, an argument was settled in politics

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
by figuring out what the founding fathers thought.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
Can you imagine that today? In a debate today, someone says,

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
ah, but didn't you know that, you know, that Thomas Jefferson

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
thought there should be a separation between churches?

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
Who cares what Thomas Jefferson thought?

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
You know, these were sort of, you know, crazy white old men

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
and that's how people see it now, right?

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
And so the thing that's lost is not necessarily religion.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
It's this American narrative.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
It's the narrative that's important now, I think.

00:41.000 --> 00:47.000
We don't have a socially recognized, legitimated home

00:47.000 --> 00:53.000
outside of the religions for people who want to ameliorate their foolishness,

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
who want to enhance their connectedness.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
If you'll allow me a little bit, a high-fluten word,

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
who want to cultivate wisdom.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Some people are saying that atheism is going out of fashion.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
You are doing a good job of trying to bring it back into fashion.

01:06.000 --> 01:13.000
Do you find something in that atheistic philosophical line of inquiry

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
to fill your soul?

01:15.000 --> 01:20.000
I think we're screwed as long as people keep looking in the wrong place.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
And that place is this realm of the propositional, right?

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
You stop bloody talking all the time and you start doing other things.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
I mean, isn't that a bad thing to say at a conference?

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
My name is Freddie Sayers. I'm in charge of Unheard.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
We are partnering this weekend with the Amazing Discipline Dialogues.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
Thanks, everyone, for making out to this extraordinary place.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
We've struggled to find a way.

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
What an opportunity we have now for the next couple of days

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
to actually get to know each other and have proper conversations.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
And I personally am really, really excited about it.

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
Without further ado, our first panel, our first deep dive,

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
we're going off the deep end straight away today,

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
is addressing the question of meaning.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
And to help us do that, we have two amazing people.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
The first you will know as Cosmic Skeptic,

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
but he is no longer Cosmic Skeptic.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
He's an artist formerly known as Cosmic Skeptic.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
He's Alex O'Connor.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
And he is joining John Vaveke,

02:26.000 --> 02:31.000
who is a professor of psychology from the University of Toronto,

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
who has coined...

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
John Serebio.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
You might know John's YouTube series,

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
Awakening from the Meaning Crisis.

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
So this question, we could not have two better people to help us of.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
That's it.

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
So, what do we do when we don't go to church?

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
Is there underlying all of these cultural wars,

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
political crises, identity crises,

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
some big, hard to define question,

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
which is basically the gap where religion used to be.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
Will people come to big industrial buildings in Brooklyn

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
to gather and find meaning in the future, do we think?

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
Alex O'Connor, is there a meaning crisis?

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
I want to say yes.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
I want to say a misleading yes,

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
because I think that people often...

03:26.000 --> 03:32.000
I think the title of this panel is Finding Meaning in a Secular Age.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
I'm not sure that the meaning crisis that we're in

03:36.000 --> 03:41.000
is strictly due to or related to secularism in particular.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
I think that if there is a meaning crisis,

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
it can be described as the human condition.

03:46.000 --> 03:51.000
If you look at what people say on some self-help YouTube video

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
about Albert Camus talking about going into work,

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
coming home, tide comes in, tide goes out,

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
sun up, sun down, and none of it means anything.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
Sure, you can find that there,

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
but you can also find it in the book of Ecclesiastes.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
This isn't a new thing.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
And so when people talk about the meaning crisis

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
and feel a bit pessimistic about the fact that, you know,

04:10.000 --> 04:16.000
they're struggling to find a reason to be and a reason to act,

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
the first thing that I'd like to point out

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
is that this isn't some modern phenomenon.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
It's exacerbated by new specific modern phenomena,

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
social media, phone addiction, this kind of stuff.

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
But the idea of, like, struggling to find meaning

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
is no new problem.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
So you're an atheist?

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Yes.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
A proud atheist?

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
A reluctant atheist.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
Where do you get your meaning from?

04:40.000 --> 04:45.000
Well, I was trying to think about what meaning actually means,

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
and generally when talking about it,

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
I try to give some, like, clever-sounding academic definition,

04:51.000 --> 04:56.000
but I was reading Blaise Pascal's Ponce, The Thoughts.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
It's a marvellous, marvellous volume,

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
and I don't think it was ever supposed to be published,

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
but in the first part, Man Without God,

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
he talks about the concept of boredom.

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
There's this wonderful passage on the concept of boredom,

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
and he says, it's where you get this famous quote

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
that all of man's troubles spring from his inability

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
to sit alone in a room in silence,

05:19.000 --> 05:23.000
and he imagines somebody who tries to pass their boredom

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
by gambling.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
Every day, he goes and places a stake

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
in the hopes that he'll win some money,

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
and this is how he stops himself from being bored.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
And Pascal says, well, give this man all of the money

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
that he could have won in the gambling game

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
on the condition that he can't play anymore,

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
and you'll make him unhappy,

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
because there's no thrill in it, there's no excitement.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
Okay, so he doesn't just want to win the money,

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
he wants to play the game.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
Okay, says Pascal, allow him to play the game,

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
but he's guaranteed not to win the money.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
You're also going to make him upset.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Okay, so what is it then?

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
Something like not having the thing desired,

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
along with the illusion that once you achieve the thing

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
that's desired, it's going to make you happy,

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
but because having the thing on its own

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
isn't actually going to make you happy,

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
you also need to not have it.

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
So meaning has to be something like

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
that slightly self-deceptive position

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
of identifying happiness in something you don't have,

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
believing that you can achieve it,

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
and then constantly not achieve it, right?

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Because it used to be the case that the things that...

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
I mean, with the sort of centers of meaning,

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
the self-help stuff that I was mentioning a moment ago,

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
they say, you know, seek discomfort, cold showers,

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
and go to the gym and eat healthily and this kind of thing,

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
and it's because, you know, it used to be that when you wake up,

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
it was a gamble.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
You don't know if you're going to have a shelter over your head,

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
you don't know if you're going to have food to eat every single day,

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
the thing resets.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
Now, you've got the money without the game,

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
you've got the food, you've got the shelter, you're fine.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
So what people are doing is they're seeking out the game

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
without the prize.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
This is why religion does it so well,

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
because religion is the definition of something

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
which you don't have now,

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
and for your entire life will not have,

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
and yet believe that you can have

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
and think that that thing is desirable.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
That must be the thing that religion serves.

07:14.000 --> 07:19.000
So, look, I was really happy to be invited and speak here,

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
and I think it's wonderful,

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
but when somebody asks me where do I find my meaning,

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
I'm as much in this struggle as anybody else.

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
There's nothing that I can do to help you find it,

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
except for firstly helping to try and recognize

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
what it is that we're actually looking for,

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
and I think it's maybe something like that.

07:35.000 --> 07:39.000
John, do you recognize that struggle, that description,

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
or do you have a bit more of a sort of purposeful view of it?

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
Well, no, I mean, I respect Alex what he's saying,

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
and I think there's important truths in it.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
I would say initially, I agree with Alex,

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
there's a perennial problem of meaning.

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
Ecclesiastes or books of the same ilk,

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
and I think this has to do with the fact

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
that we are perennially prone to despair,

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
because the very processes that make us intelligently adaptive

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
also make us perpetually susceptible to self-deception,

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
and we can get bound up and cut off

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
and disconnected from ourselves and other people.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
So, I think there's definitely a perennial aspect,

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
cross-cultural, cross-historical aspect to it.

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
I think what's specific about what I call the meaning crisis

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
is that those perennial problems

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
usually have had perennial solutions.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
There have been, and the solutions are not

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
what we call belief systems.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
They are systems, or better, make it more sort of dynamic.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
Ecologies of practices, ways of transforming consciousness,

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
cognition, character, community,

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
they give people a sense that they're ameliorating

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
this self-deception and enhancing their connectedness

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
to themselves, to other people, to the world.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
And those ecologies of practices have been housed

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
in various things, or homed is better.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
They've been homed in religions,

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
but they've also been homed in these things

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
that sort of hang on the border between philosophy and religion,

09:07.000 --> 09:11.000
like Buddhism and Taoism, and maybe stoicism.

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
And so what seems to be the case, though,

09:15.000 --> 09:21.000
is we don't have a socially recognized,

09:21.000 --> 09:26.000
legitimated home outside of the religions

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
for people who want to ameliorate their foolishness,

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
who want to enhance their connectedness,

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
if you'll allow me a little bit, a high-fluten word,

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
who want to cultivate wisdom.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
And because of that, and that has to do with

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
some very important historical factors.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
Do you think it's new, though?

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
Alex was saying it's been around forever.

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
Just a mile away, we have the Columbia campus.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
It has nothing to do with this conversation in a way,

09:55.000 --> 09:59.000
but the intensity of the political disagreement,

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
the sense that people are fundamentally unreconciled,

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
do you think that is just another manifestation of this?

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
Do you think we are in a particularly...

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
Very much, and I think from an anthropological point of view,

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
not a theological point of view,

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
from an anthropological point of view,

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
these are religious events.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
These are people...

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Well, I want to do what Alex said.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
What is it that we're seeking, we're seeking meaning?

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
So in cognitive science and psychology,

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
we try to distinguish between the meaning of life,

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
which is some grand metaphysical claim,

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
and meaning in life,

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
and philosophers like Susan Wolfe and others.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
So what this is is that it sort of has a bunch of factors,

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
but one is, does the world make sense to you?

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
Think of all the things you have in a video game,

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
and why people want to be in video games.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
Does the world make sense to you?

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
Is there a story that you can play a part in,

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
and is there a way for you to level up,

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
for you to get better as a person,

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
like to enhance your agency?

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
And so it's this fundamental sense of connectedness.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
And so you can determine meaning in life

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
by asking people three questions.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
What do you want to exist even if you don't?

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
How really real is it,

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
what's the difference to you make to it now?

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
These people in these events,

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
they want to connect to something,

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
a cause that's bigger than themselves,

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
and they want it to exist.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
They think the universe is a better place

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
if this cause is there.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
They think it's really real.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
They think these are real events.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
This is significant, important.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
This isn't like going to the store and buying milk.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
And they think they can make a difference

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
by participating in it, committing to it.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
And so I think it's very much,

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
an act about trying to get this connectedness.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
And the fervor means

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
that it's being driven by a tinge of anxiety,

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
a tinge of hunger,

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
a tinge even of potential despair.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
I mean, they would say,

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
if they were here right now on this panel,

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
they'd be pretty cross

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
by that suggestion, I think,

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
because they would say there are big problems.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
These are issues which they're engaged with

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
in a practical way.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
Alex, do you look at the news?

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
Do you look at stuff happening like in Colombia?

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
There are now these,

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
what appear to be completely

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
unrecognizable battles.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
Do you

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
see something existential

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
in them? Or do you think it's just

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
politics or cultural war?

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
Well, existentialism is always

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
sort of at the basis of

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
of political and cultural disputes.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
There's always something, there's always some like

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
bedrock that people are working from.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Because if they weren't, then you could just solve these disputes

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
by using reason. You could just sort of figure out

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
what that disagreement is, figure out who

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
most agrees with the

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
bedrock that you both share, and there you go,

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
like problem solved. But no, there's some kind of

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
philosophical

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
bedrock. The thing that people are looking for,

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
the reason why you can't just argue people out of this stuff,

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
and it's something that I've spoken to John about before,

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
and I think we'll agree on, is that

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
wherever this meaning thing exists,

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
if you look at traditional centers of meaning,

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
art and poetry and religion,

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
like one of the unifying features

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
is that it is non-propositional.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
It's not something that you put into a syllogism,

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
it's not something that you sort of rationalize and argue.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
Will you just explain what that means?

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
So, it's like,

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
the way I'll explain it is, I imagine,

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
I kind of wanted to make like a sketch.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
What I'm trying to say is that

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
the way of doing philosophy that

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
arises with the analytic philosophical tradition,

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
so trying to translate all philosophy

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
into

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
if p then q, p

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
therefore q, like that rationally

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
follows logical deduction, that kind of stuff.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
This is not how people interact with the world.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
This is not how people behave.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
If you open the Bible, you do not find a single syllogism.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Like, this is not why people come to believe in God.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
This is probably something you'll talk about

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
with Richard Dawkins and Ayan Hirsi Ali.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
I imagined, for example, this sketch I wanted to make.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
There's like a man

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
who is in desperation

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
about to throw himself off a bridge,

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
and someone comes up to him and says,

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
what are you doing? You know?

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
And he says, I'm just so hopeless, you know?

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
Life has no meaning. And the guy says,

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
have you ever thought about the question of God?

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
And he says, you know, I've thought about it sometimes.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Maybe I feel like I'm being listened to.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
And then he recites a poem to him.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
And he's overwhelmed with beauty.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
And he considers getting off of the ledge.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
And the man talks him through this narrative.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
He tells him about his own struggles with meaning and purpose.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
And the man's like, okay, you know,

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
I feel heard. I feel seen.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
And he's about to climb back over the ledge.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
But then he remembers that

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
the principle of sufficient reason fails

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
because of modal fatalism in the academy.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
So he throws himself off the bridge.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
It's not how people think.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
It's not how people behave, right?

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
Like Keith says that...

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
He says, do not all charms fly

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
at the mere touch

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
of cold philosophy.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Philosophy will clip an angel's wings,

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
conquer all mysteries

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
by rule and line.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
But you have a whole show devoted to philosophy.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
This is your topic.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
Yes.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
Is that the time?

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
I think...

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
Yeah, I do.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
Presumably you find it helps you.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
I'm really fascinated to know

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
you are...

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
Some people are saying that atheism

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
is going out of fashion.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
You are doing a good job

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
of trying to bring it back into fashion.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
Do you

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
find something in that

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
atheistic philosophical line of inquiry

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
to

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
fill your soul?

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
But atheism doesn't really have

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
that kind of content.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
Right?

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
You are right that my show is all about philosophy.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
But whereas when I was

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
a 17 or 18 year old getting started,

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
my whole show, my whole stick

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
was doing the

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
well actually thing.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
That commits that logical fallacy

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
and therefore that doesn't actually follow from that.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
And you know what it worked? People liked it.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
They thought, this is cool and they watched it.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
The reason I'm saying this now is because

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
I'm not a 17 or 18 year old anymore.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
I realized that that's not...

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
It's not what connects with me.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
I can't remember where it comes from

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
but C.S. Lewis at one point

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
talks about how

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
when he made this shift, and what I'm trying to say is that

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
where I used to do that, I still talk about philosophy

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
but I am trying to encourage my audience

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
to instead of getting down

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
and analyzing every brush stroke

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
of a painting and trying to understand

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
the Mona Lisa by looking at it through a microscope

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
and trying to figure out what the pigment is

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
by just stepping back and looking at the picture

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
and realizing that that's what you were supposed to be doing all along.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
C.S. Lewis when he made this kind of shift

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
because C.S. Lewis used to be an atheist.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
He used to be the rationalist, atheist type

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
and then okay, he becomes a Christian

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
but before that he realizes the importance of narrative

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
and the non propositional

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
and he realized that he was being asked

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
by what I see

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
is now sort of the popular philosophical

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
analytic tradition. He's being asked

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
to deny that which is most real to him.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
Meaning

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
purpose, narrative

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
stories that connected with him

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
he was being asked to deny that

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
and accept as true the things that were most unreal to him

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
like numbers

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
and abstractions

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
and sort of geometric shapes that sort of exist

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
somewhere in the platonic form

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
the realm of forms or whatever

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
and that's just not how humans work.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
So you're already on the C.S. Lewis journey then

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
you had two steps out of three

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
get you back here in ten years

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
You mentioned my previous

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
YouTube name, it's why one of my good friends used to call me

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
his second favorite C.S.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
I

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
can't see something like that coming around the corner

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
but I've learned a lot from the man about

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
specifically this but C.S. Lewis himself

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
even being one of the most

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
prolific apologists

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
for Christianity in the world, realized

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
that it's not about the

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
the apologia, he wrote a poem

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
called The Apologist's Evening Prayer

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
which he imagines sitting down

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
and

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
those spending days and days

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
arguing successfully for God's existence

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
I can

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
do it if you want, it's like two paragraphs, it's quite short

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
I don't want to take too much time

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
he says from all my

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
lame defeats

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
and oh much more, from all the victories

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
I seemed to score

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
from cleverness shot forth on

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
thy behalf at which

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
whilst angels weep

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
the audience laugh

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
from all my proofs of thy divinity

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
thou who'd give no sign

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
deliver me

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
thoughts abut coins

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
let me not trust

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
instead of thee their thin worn

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
image of thy head

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
from all my thoughts even my

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
thoughts of thee

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
thou fair silence

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
fall and set me free

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
lord if the narrow gate and needles I

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
take from me all my trumpery

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
lest I die

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
and coming from C.S. Lewis

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
that is an extraordinary

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
revelation about

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
what all of this is really about

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
well you know we promise

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
surprises to have the

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
famous atheist quoting

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
beautiful C.S. Lewis poetry is a great beginning

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
to this conversation

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
John

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
you don't recite C.S. Lewis

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
what do you do to

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
are you a theist

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
are you a half way to being a theist

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
I would describe myself

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
as a non theist

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
a non theist thinks there

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
is still an open question

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
about the reference of words like sacredness

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
without

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
agreeing to the proposal

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
that the only way that can be captured

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
is by a supernatural

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
super thing super person

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
so that you could like

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
there are religions that

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
are properly non theistic like Taoism

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
Zen within Buddhism

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
things like that

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
I want to pick up on something Alex said

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
first of all

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
like you

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
I'm

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
very impressed with the

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
flexibility

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
and depth of Alex's thought

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
I want to pick up on

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
what he said about the non propositional

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
this is a big chunk of my work as a cognitive scientist

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
I have been arguing that there are

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
four kinds of knowing

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
there is one the propositional where Alex

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
is critiqued and each one of these

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
is a kind of memory

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
this is how we know that there are actually distinct things

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
and then there is your procedural memory

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
this is knowing how to do things

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
you knew how to walk and sit down

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
you didn't do that by writing an argument

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
that's a skill it's not a belief

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
it's a skill but it's a way of

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
being in contact with reality

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
then you have your perspectival knowing

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
you know how to notice things

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
how to focus your attention

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
how to be present or absent

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
with people

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
you know that

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
you have a kind of memory attached to this

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
this is your episodic memory

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
this is when you remember specific events

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
and the perspectives you took on them

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
and then there is a deeper kind of memory

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
that is called your participatory

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
memory or participatory knowing

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
this is you are knowing by how

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
you and the world fit together

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
given biological constraints

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
cultural constraints historical constraints

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
for example there was all kinds of things

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
laid out for you culturally and biologically

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
where that was all available to you

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
in which if I dropped you into Papua New Guinea

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
you'd be going like you wouldn't know

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
so all of those things

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
now why is that important given what Alex said

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
well the argument is

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
those non propositional kinds of knowing

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
are where most of your cognitive agency is

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
that's where most of your meaning making is

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
let me give you an example

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
we think we're talking

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
abstract thought

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
when we're talking propositional

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
listen to the word abstract lift out

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
moving around and progressing

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
through an argument or getting to the

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
end or what's underneath this argument

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
or what does it stand on or can I

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
we use all this language

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
and what's becoming apparent from cognitive

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
science is we take all of that

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
non propositional machinery that we use

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
for navigating the world

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
I mean like the physical world

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
and what we do is we bootstrap it up

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
into navigating the intellectual world

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
and so this world up here the abstract

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
world can't actually function

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
autonomously it has to constantly

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
get nourished

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
by the non propositional

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
that's what he did with the poem

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
so what do we

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
what do we do

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
with all of that how do we

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
well you stop bloody talking

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
all the time and you start doing other

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
things I mean isn't that a bad thing to say

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
at a conference right

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
but what you do is no you have

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
you have practices you have to do

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
individual and what the research is

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
doing you have to do collective

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
collaborative practices

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
so you know I do

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
Tai Chi Chuan I meditate

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
I contemplate I do a journaling practice

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
from stoicism and what you do

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
is you find sets of practices

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
and they there's formal reasons

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
for this but they have sets of strengths

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
and weaknesses and you try to get them

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
so that they're as self corrective as possible

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
so that you are comprehensively

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
intervening in this

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
meaning making machinery because here's

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
the thing it's not

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
it's not optional it will run

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
regardless of what you're doing up here

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
the issue is can you get it run

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
in a way that is actually at least

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
responsive to good

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
argument and evidence up here

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
and the answer is you can

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
it's not optional you can't like

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
I just won't pay any attention to that

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
that's not optional for you

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
but what you can do is make practices

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
this is like Plato you want to get

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
the man and the lion and the monster

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
properly talking to each other and a lot

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
of that talking isn't through speech

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
it's by engaging in

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
new ways of noticing

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
new ways

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
of taking a stance

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
towards a situation new ways

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
of assuming an identity and a role

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
in a situation it feels

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
somewhat mechanical though

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
doesn't it I mean both of these

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
processes

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
whether it's creating a task

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
that you can never quite conclude

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
what you talked about at the end

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
that offers a false promise

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
or engaging in practices

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
that almost seem to sort of trick your

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
so no no no I wouldn't say true

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
are they are you doing these

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
with a sense that there is a truth

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
that you are getting closer to

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
are you a is this a

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
purposeful faithful

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
activity well I'm going to challenge you

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
because you used the property of propositions

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
to ask me the question which means you're still prioritizing them

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
your skills aren't true

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
or false they're powerful or not

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
and power is another way we judge

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
realness your perspectives aren't

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
true or not it's whether or not

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
they make you feel present in a situation

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
like and you're

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
foregrounding the right things and backgrounding

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
the right things are you taking

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
the right role that your participatory knowing

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
that's real because if you don't take the right

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
role you can't engage

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
with the correct set of problems that you're being faced

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
and you can't be responsible in the

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
appropriate manner these are all different

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
we don't have a single sense of

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
realness we have multiple senses

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
of realness and part of what I think

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
we're trying to do is

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
relearn how to re-coordinate

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
those senses of realnesses so they

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
are not operating

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
orthogonally or antagonistically

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
but so they're mutually correcting and affording each other

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
so that we get the fullest possible

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
connectedness to what we think

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
is most reliably real

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
not just abstractly but in the guts

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
of our lives

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
putting all that together

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
and trying to zoom out

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
to look at how

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
the whole of society might

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
or might not shift

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
do you think we're screwed

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
do you think are we

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
going to have millions of people engaging

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
in this kind of purposeful activity and therefore

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
changing the

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
direction of the meaning crisis

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
or do you think we are headed in a

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
direction that only gets worse

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
I think we're screwed as long as people keep

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
looking in the wrong place

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
and that place

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
is this realm of the propositional

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
that's why I think John and I

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
get on so well in our podcast that we did together

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
as well because this is something we can

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
completely agree on that

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
obviously sorry to

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
disappoint you I can't tell you how to find

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
meaning that's not something that I'm

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
going to be able to do in 6 minutes and 53 seconds

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
and I don't think anybody seriously thinks

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
that I'm going to be able to do that

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
but you're still here listening we just want to

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
talk about what meaning is so I can't tell you

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
where it is found but I can

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
tell you where it's not and it's not found

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
at the bottom of a microscope

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
it's not found in these

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
syllogisms people don't

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
anything that brings people meaning

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
being talked into it all being

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
talked out of it never happens

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
rarely happens

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
because of syllogistic

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
argumentation it's something else

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
I was reading Leo Tolstoy's

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
Confession it's a wonderful

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
it's brilliant it's only like 100 pages

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
and he talks about how he was

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
he knew somebody who'd been on a camp

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
with his brother or something

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
and it stunned me as well because it was so long

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
ago it reads as if they're talking about the modern

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
world and its abandonment of religion due to

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
technology and all of this kind of stuff

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
but this is Tolstoy and he says that this friend

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
he's up with his brother

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
and they're in a tent and at the end of the night

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
he sort of bows down to pray do his nightly

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
prayers like they were trained to do his children

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
and his brother says

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
do you still do that

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
and that question alone

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
that just that was enough

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
such that that man never got down on his knees

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
and prayed ever again

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
there's no argument there's something

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
that isn't syllogized

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
that's sort of brought about by that kind of attitude

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
that completely changed his mind

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
and Tolstoy himself concluded that

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
while looking for questions of meaning he realized

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
that the more precise the answer

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
the less interesting the answer was

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
and the closer it was

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
to answering the question that he was interested in

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
the more vague it necessarily became

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
you know I can tell you

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
in principle exactly how many

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
molecules are in that jug of water over there

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
but who cares

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
it doesn't mean anything

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
and I think we're sort of stuck

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
the reason that we are sort of perpetually screwed

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
is because of that sort of

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
that

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
discorrelation that anti-correlation

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
that the more specific the answer becomes

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
the less

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
interesting a question is answering

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
with relation to meaning wherever meaning is

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
in other words it has to sort of lie

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
within the gaps there

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
and that's an old story

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
that's nothing new

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
Is that pessimistic or optimistic

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
I'm trying to work it out

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
what is the answer to while we screwed

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
I mean do you think

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
we're putting all that together

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
we have a secular society

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
the numbers for religious faith

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
are continuing to plummet

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
do you think there are mechanisms

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
narratives

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
poems

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
structures

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
that will help rebuild

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
something out of this

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
because look I'm speaking very

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
the people who have said

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
that I'm on some kind of C.S. Lewis conversion

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
story might get excited by the things I'm saying

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
don't be fooled

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
the reason I talk about religion so much

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
is just because it's the best example

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
of a narrative of a story

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
but the thing that's providing

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
the meaning

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
the thing that I think is causing people

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
to not be despairing

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
if they're really sort of

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
head first into this religious stuff

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
it's not because of the religion

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
the thing that makes religion different

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
from any other form of narrative is its propositional content

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
the belief in a God

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
the belief in a specific set of ethical codes

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
I've already said that that I don't think is the important thing

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
the important thing is the narrative

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
the reason the United States did so well for a time

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
in this foundational nation myth

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
the meaning

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
in an American's life

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
after the Revolutionary War

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
was not found in the fact that

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
Washington swears in on a Bible

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
but because the man who's swearing in is himself

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
something of a mythical figure

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
but it seems to have lost confidence in that myth

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
and so you point to

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
the crisis of secularism

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
in modern America

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
is it secularism or is it just a loss of narrative

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
if we'd have gotten rid of the God stuff

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
this real attachment

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
people often quote or used to quote

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
the founding fathers of this nation

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
as if they were quoting Hadiths of the Prophet Muhammad

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
an argument was

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
settled in politics

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
by figuring out what the founding fathers thought

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
can you imagine that today

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
in a debate today someone says

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
Thomas Jefferson thought there should be

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
a separation between churches

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
who cares what Thomas Jefferson thought

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
these were sort of crazy

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
white old men and that's how people see it now

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
so the thing that's lost is not necessarily religion

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
it's this American narrative

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
it's the narrative that's important now I think

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
John do you think

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
we're coming to the conclusion of this

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
half hour

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
do you think there are narratives

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
that are on the up

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
do you think there is cause

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
to feel like this is not just a

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
downward trajectory

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
I think there's increasing sign

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
for

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
what I call the advent of the sacred

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
people who

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
I'm in conversation with them

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
and I both study them scientifically and participate

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
with them there's all these emerging

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
communities of practices all these

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
new ways in which people

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
are trying to

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
get at

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
a home for their desire to connect

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
and to transcend

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
sort of the prison of their egocentric

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
way of life

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
and they

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
are generally

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
open to the fact that they think

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
the traditional way of talking

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
isn't working for them

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
the fastest demographic group

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
fastest growing demographic group are the nuns

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
the NONES's

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
they'll overtake Christianity

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
in the United States probably in the next

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
two decades or so

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
something like that or maybe a little bit longer

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
and these people are not

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
by and large

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
sort of

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
just dyed in the wool analytic atheists

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
they're very much

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
you know people like Alex

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
people who are

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
I think appropriately called seeking

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
they're seeking in some way they're open

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
they're trying to

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
consider new ways of thinking about this

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
and

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
I think that is predicting that there is going to be

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
a fundamental

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
change I mean barring

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
that we don't destroy the world and other things along the way

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
because any attempt to

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
and this would be my critique of all ideological

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
political endeavors

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
any attempt to top down this into existence

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
is going to fail this has got to

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
bottom up it's got to come up

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
like I said out of that non propositional

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
out of people doing new practices

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
forming new kinds of communities

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
then the narratives

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
will be born they'll be born out of that

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
they can't just be made and imposed

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
on people or sold to people

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
that won't take that won't work

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
ladies and gentlemen

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
thank you so much to

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
both of our panelists

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
on this conversation
