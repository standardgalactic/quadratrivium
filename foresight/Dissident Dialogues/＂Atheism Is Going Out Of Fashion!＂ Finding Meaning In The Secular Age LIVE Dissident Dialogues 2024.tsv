0	4000	Is it secularism or is it just a loss of narrative?
4000	8000	If we'd have gotten rid of the God stuff, but kept this real attachment,
8000	12000	I mean, people often quote or used to quote the founding fathers of this nation
12000	14000	as if they were quoting Hadiths of the Prophet Muhammad.
14000	18000	Like, they've just, like, an argument was settled in politics
18000	21000	by figuring out what the founding fathers thought.
21000	23000	Can you imagine that today? In a debate today, someone says,
23000	26000	ah, but didn't you know that, you know, that Thomas Jefferson
26000	28000	thought there should be a separation between churches?
28000	30000	Who cares what Thomas Jefferson thought?
30000	33000	You know, these were sort of, you know, crazy white old men
33000	35000	and that's how people see it now, right?
35000	37000	And so the thing that's lost is not necessarily religion.
37000	39000	It's this American narrative.
39000	41000	It's the narrative that's important now, I think.
41000	47000	We don't have a socially recognized, legitimated home
47000	53000	outside of the religions for people who want to ameliorate their foolishness,
53000	56000	who want to enhance their connectedness.
56000	58000	If you'll allow me a little bit, a high-fluten word,
58000	60000	who want to cultivate wisdom.
60000	62000	Some people are saying that atheism is going out of fashion.
62000	66000	You are doing a good job of trying to bring it back into fashion.
66000	73000	Do you find something in that atheistic philosophical line of inquiry
73000	75000	to fill your soul?
75000	80000	I think we're screwed as long as people keep looking in the wrong place.
80000	84000	And that place is this realm of the propositional, right?
84000	88000	You stop bloody talking all the time and you start doing other things.
88000	90000	I mean, isn't that a bad thing to say at a conference?
97000	100000	My name is Freddie Sayers. I'm in charge of Unheard.
100000	104000	We are partnering this weekend with the Amazing Discipline Dialogues.
104000	108000	Thanks, everyone, for making out to this extraordinary place.
108000	111000	We've struggled to find a way.
112000	116000	What an opportunity we have now for the next couple of days
116000	119000	to actually get to know each other and have proper conversations.
119000	121000	And I personally am really, really excited about it.
121000	125000	Without further ado, our first panel, our first deep dive,
125000	129000	we're going off the deep end straight away today,
129000	131000	is addressing the question of meaning.
131000	134000	And to help us do that, we have two amazing people.
134000	137000	The first you will know as Cosmic Skeptic,
137000	139000	but he is no longer Cosmic Skeptic.
139000	141000	He's an artist formerly known as Cosmic Skeptic.
141000	143000	He's Alex O'Connor.
143000	146000	And he is joining John Vaveke,
146000	151000	who is a professor of psychology from the University of Toronto,
151000	153000	who has coined...
156000	158000	John Serebio.
158000	161000	You might know John's YouTube series,
161000	163000	Awakening from the Meaning Crisis.
163000	167000	So this question, we could not have two better people to help us of.
167000	169000	That's it.
171000	175000	So, what do we do when we don't go to church?
175000	179000	Is there underlying all of these cultural wars,
179000	182000	political crises, identity crises,
182000	186000	some big, hard to define question,
186000	190000	which is basically the gap where religion used to be.
190000	193000	Will people come to big industrial buildings in Brooklyn
193000	196000	to gather and find meaning in the future, do we think?
196000	200000	Alex O'Connor, is there a meaning crisis?
200000	202000	I want to say yes.
202000	204000	I want to say a misleading yes,
204000	206000	because I think that people often...
206000	212000	I think the title of this panel is Finding Meaning in a Secular Age.
212000	216000	I'm not sure that the meaning crisis that we're in
216000	221000	is strictly due to or related to secularism in particular.
221000	224000	I think that if there is a meaning crisis,
224000	226000	it can be described as the human condition.
226000	231000	If you look at what people say on some self-help YouTube video
231000	235000	about Albert Camus talking about going into work,
235000	238000	coming home, tide comes in, tide goes out,
238000	240000	sun up, sun down, and none of it means anything.
240000	242000	Sure, you can find that there,
242000	244000	but you can also find it in the book of Ecclesiastes.
244000	245000	This isn't a new thing.
245000	247000	And so when people talk about the meaning crisis
247000	250000	and feel a bit pessimistic about the fact that, you know,
250000	256000	they're struggling to find a reason to be and a reason to act,
256000	258000	the first thing that I'd like to point out
258000	260000	is that this isn't some modern phenomenon.
260000	264000	It's exacerbated by new specific modern phenomena,
264000	266000	social media, phone addiction, this kind of stuff.
266000	270000	But the idea of, like, struggling to find meaning
270000	272000	is no new problem.
272000	274000	So you're an atheist?
274000	275000	Yes.
275000	276000	A proud atheist?
276000	277000	A reluctant atheist.
277000	280000	Where do you get your meaning from?
280000	285000	Well, I was trying to think about what meaning actually means,
285000	288000	and generally when talking about it,
288000	291000	I try to give some, like, clever-sounding academic definition,
291000	296000	but I was reading Blaise Pascal's Ponce, The Thoughts.
296000	298000	It's a marvellous, marvellous volume,
298000	300000	and I don't think it was ever supposed to be published,
300000	303000	but in the first part, Man Without God,
303000	307000	he talks about the concept of boredom.
307000	311000	There's this wonderful passage on the concept of boredom,
311000	314000	and he says, it's where you get this famous quote
314000	317000	that all of man's troubles spring from his inability
317000	319000	to sit alone in a room in silence,
319000	323000	and he imagines somebody who tries to pass their boredom
323000	324000	by gambling.
324000	327000	Every day, he goes and places a stake
327000	329000	in the hopes that he'll win some money,
329000	332000	and this is how he stops himself from being bored.
332000	335000	And Pascal says, well, give this man all of the money
335000	339000	that he could have won in the gambling game
339000	341000	on the condition that he can't play anymore,
341000	343000	and you'll make him unhappy,
343000	345000	because there's no thrill in it, there's no excitement.
345000	347000	Okay, so he doesn't just want to win the money,
347000	349000	he wants to play the game.
349000	351000	Okay, says Pascal, allow him to play the game,
351000	354000	but he's guaranteed not to win the money.
354000	356000	You're also going to make him upset.
356000	358000	Okay, so what is it then?
358000	362000	Something like not having the thing desired,
362000	365000	along with the illusion that once you achieve the thing
365000	368000	that's desired, it's going to make you happy,
368000	369000	but because having the thing on its own
369000	371000	isn't actually going to make you happy,
371000	373000	you also need to not have it.
373000	377000	So meaning has to be something like
377000	381000	that slightly self-deceptive position
381000	384000	of identifying happiness in something you don't have,
384000	386000	believing that you can achieve it,
386000	388000	and then constantly not achieve it, right?
388000	390000	Because it used to be the case that the things that...
390000	392000	I mean, with the sort of centers of meaning,
392000	394000	the self-help stuff that I was mentioning a moment ago,
394000	398000	they say, you know, seek discomfort, cold showers,
398000	401000	and go to the gym and eat healthily and this kind of thing,
401000	403000	and it's because, you know, it used to be that when you wake up,
403000	405000	it was a gamble.
405000	407000	You don't know if you're going to have a shelter over your head,
407000	409000	you don't know if you're going to have food to eat every single day,
409000	411000	the thing resets.
411000	413000	Now, you've got the money without the game,
413000	415000	you've got the food, you've got the shelter, you're fine.
415000	418000	So what people are doing is they're seeking out the game
418000	420000	without the prize.
420000	422000	This is why religion does it so well,
422000	424000	because religion is the definition of something
424000	426000	which you don't have now,
426000	428000	and for your entire life will not have,
428000	430000	and yet believe that you can have
430000	432000	and think that that thing is desirable.
432000	434000	That must be the thing that religion serves.
434000	439000	So, look, I was really happy to be invited and speak here,
439000	441000	and I think it's wonderful,
441000	443000	but when somebody asks me where do I find my meaning,
443000	445000	I'm as much in this struggle as anybody else.
445000	449000	There's nothing that I can do to help you find it,
449000	451000	except for firstly helping to try and recognize
451000	453000	what it is that we're actually looking for,
453000	455000	and I think it's maybe something like that.
455000	459000	John, do you recognize that struggle, that description,
459000	463000	or do you have a bit more of a sort of purposeful view of it?
463000	466000	Well, no, I mean, I respect Alex what he's saying,
466000	469000	and I think there's important truths in it.
469000	472000	I would say initially, I agree with Alex,
472000	474000	there's a perennial problem of meaning.
474000	478000	Ecclesiastes or books of the same ilk,
478000	480000	and I think this has to do with the fact
480000	484000	that we are perennially prone to despair,
484000	488000	because the very processes that make us intelligently adaptive
488000	491000	also make us perpetually susceptible to self-deception,
491000	493000	and we can get bound up and cut off
493000	496000	and disconnected from ourselves and other people.
496000	499000	So, I think there's definitely a perennial aspect,
499000	502000	cross-cultural, cross-historical aspect to it.
502000	506000	I think what's specific about what I call the meaning crisis
506000	509000	is that those perennial problems
509000	512000	usually have had perennial solutions.
512000	514000	There have been, and the solutions are not
514000	516000	what we call belief systems.
516000	520000	They are systems, or better, make it more sort of dynamic.
520000	523000	Ecologies of practices, ways of transforming consciousness,
523000	525000	cognition, character, community,
525000	529000	they give people a sense that they're ameliorating
529000	532000	this self-deception and enhancing their connectedness
532000	535000	to themselves, to other people, to the world.
535000	537000	And those ecologies of practices have been housed
537000	539000	in various things, or homed is better.
539000	542000	They've been homed in religions,
542000	544000	but they've also been homed in these things
544000	547000	that sort of hang on the border between philosophy and religion,
547000	551000	like Buddhism and Taoism, and maybe stoicism.
551000	555000	And so what seems to be the case, though,
555000	561000	is we don't have a socially recognized,
561000	566000	legitimated home outside of the religions
566000	569000	for people who want to ameliorate their foolishness,
569000	572000	who want to enhance their connectedness,
572000	575000	if you'll allow me a little bit, a high-fluten word,
575000	577000	who want to cultivate wisdom.
577000	580000	And because of that, and that has to do with
580000	583000	some very important historical factors.
583000	585000	Do you think it's new, though?
585000	588000	Alex was saying it's been around forever.
588000	592000	Just a mile away, we have the Columbia campus.
592000	595000	It has nothing to do with this conversation in a way,
595000	599000	but the intensity of the political disagreement,
599000	602000	the sense that people are fundamentally unreconciled,
602000	605000	do you think that is just another manifestation of this?
605000	607000	Do you think we are in a particularly...
607000	609000	Very much, and I think from an anthropological point of view,
609000	611000	not a theological point of view,
611000	613000	from an anthropological point of view,
613000	615000	these are religious events.
615000	616000	These are people...
616000	618000	Well, I want to do what Alex said.
618000	621000	What is it that we're seeking, we're seeking meaning?
621000	623000	So in cognitive science and psychology,
623000	626000	we try to distinguish between the meaning of life,
626000	628000	which is some grand metaphysical claim,
628000	630000	and meaning in life,
630000	633000	and philosophers like Susan Wolfe and others.
633000	636000	So what this is is that it sort of has a bunch of factors,
636000	639000	but one is, does the world make sense to you?
639000	641000	Think of all the things you have in a video game,
641000	643000	and why people want to be in video games.
643000	645000	Does the world make sense to you?
645000	647000	Is there a story that you can play a part in,
647000	649000	and is there a way for you to level up,
649000	651000	for you to get better as a person,
651000	653000	like to enhance your agency?
653000	656000	And so it's this fundamental sense of connectedness.
656000	658000	And so you can determine meaning in life
658000	660000	by asking people three questions.
660000	663000	What do you want to exist even if you don't?
663000	665000	How really real is it,
665000	667000	what's the difference to you make to it now?
667000	669000	These people in these events,
669000	671000	they want to connect to something,
671000	673000	a cause that's bigger than themselves,
673000	675000	and they want it to exist.
675000	677000	They think the universe is a better place
677000	679000	if this cause is there.
679000	681000	They think it's really real.
681000	683000	They think these are real events.
683000	685000	This is significant, important.
685000	687000	This isn't like going to the store and buying milk.
687000	689000	And they think they can make a difference
689000	691000	by participating in it, committing to it.
691000	693000	And so I think it's very much,
693000	695000	an act about trying to get this connectedness.
695000	697000	And the fervor means
697000	699000	that it's being driven by a tinge of anxiety,
699000	701000	a tinge of hunger,
701000	703000	a tinge even of potential despair.
703000	705000	I mean, they would say,
705000	707000	if they were here right now on this panel,
707000	709000	they'd be pretty cross
709000	711000	by that suggestion, I think,
711000	713000	because they would say there are big problems.
713000	715000	These are issues which they're engaged with
715000	717000	in a practical way.
717000	719000	Alex, do you look at the news?
719000	721000	Do you look at stuff happening like in Colombia?
721000	723000	There are now these,
723000	725000	what appear to be completely
725000	727000	unrecognizable battles.
727000	729000	Do you
729000	731000	see something existential
731000	733000	in them? Or do you think it's just
733000	735000	politics or cultural war?
735000	737000	Well, existentialism is always
737000	739000	sort of at the basis of
739000	741000	of political and cultural disputes.
741000	743000	There's always something, there's always some like
743000	745000	bedrock that people are working from.
745000	747000	Because if they weren't, then you could just solve these disputes
747000	749000	by using reason. You could just sort of figure out
749000	751000	what that disagreement is, figure out who
751000	753000	most agrees with the
753000	755000	bedrock that you both share, and there you go,
755000	757000	like problem solved. But no, there's some kind of
757000	759000	philosophical
759000	761000	bedrock. The thing that people are looking for,
761000	763000	the reason why you can't just argue people out of this stuff,
763000	765000	and it's something that I've spoken to John about before,
765000	767000	and I think we'll agree on, is that
767000	769000	wherever this meaning thing exists,
769000	771000	if you look at traditional centers of meaning,
771000	773000	art and poetry and religion,
773000	775000	like one of the unifying features
775000	777000	is that it is non-propositional.
777000	779000	It's not something that you put into a syllogism,
779000	781000	it's not something that you sort of rationalize and argue.
781000	783000	Will you just explain what that means?
783000	785000	So, it's like,
785000	787000	the way I'll explain it is, I imagine,
787000	789000	I kind of wanted to make like a sketch.
789000	791000	What I'm trying to say is that
791000	793000	the way of doing philosophy that
793000	795000	arises with the analytic philosophical tradition,
795000	797000	so trying to translate all philosophy
797000	799000	into
799000	801000	if p then q, p
801000	803000	therefore q, like that rationally
803000	805000	follows logical deduction, that kind of stuff.
805000	807000	This is not how people interact with the world.
807000	809000	This is not how people behave.
809000	811000	If you open the Bible, you do not find a single syllogism.
811000	813000	Like, this is not why people come to believe in God.
813000	815000	This is probably something you'll talk about
815000	817000	with Richard Dawkins and Ayan Hirsi Ali.
817000	819000	I imagined, for example, this sketch I wanted to make.
819000	821000	There's like a man
821000	823000	who is in desperation
823000	825000	about to throw himself off a bridge,
825000	827000	and someone comes up to him and says,
827000	829000	what are you doing? You know?
829000	831000	And he says, I'm just so hopeless, you know?
831000	833000	Life has no meaning. And the guy says,
833000	835000	have you ever thought about the question of God?
835000	837000	And he says, you know, I've thought about it sometimes.
837000	839000	Maybe I feel like I'm being listened to.
839000	841000	And then he recites a poem to him.
841000	843000	And he's overwhelmed with beauty.
843000	845000	And he considers getting off of the ledge.
845000	847000	And the man talks him through this narrative.
847000	849000	He tells him about his own struggles with meaning and purpose.
849000	851000	And the man's like, okay, you know,
851000	853000	I feel heard. I feel seen.
853000	855000	And he's about to climb back over the ledge.
855000	857000	But then he remembers that
857000	859000	the principle of sufficient reason fails
859000	861000	because of modal fatalism in the academy.
861000	863000	So he throws himself off the bridge.
863000	865000	It's not how people think.
865000	867000	It's not how people behave, right?
867000	869000	Like Keith says that...
869000	871000	He says, do not all charms fly
871000	873000	at the mere touch
873000	875000	of cold philosophy.
875000	877000	Philosophy will clip an angel's wings,
877000	879000	conquer all mysteries
879000	881000	by rule and line.
881000	883000	But you have a whole show devoted to philosophy.
883000	885000	This is your topic.
885000	887000	Yes.
887000	889000	Is that the time?
889000	891000	I think...
891000	893000	Yeah, I do.
893000	895000	Presumably you find it helps you.
895000	897000	I'm really fascinated to know
897000	899000	you are...
899000	901000	Some people are saying that atheism
901000	903000	is going out of fashion.
903000	905000	You are doing a good job
905000	907000	of trying to bring it back into fashion.
907000	909000	Do you
909000	911000	find something in that
911000	913000	atheistic philosophical line of inquiry
913000	915000	to
915000	917000	fill your soul?
917000	919000	But atheism doesn't really have
919000	921000	that kind of content.
921000	923000	Right?
923000	925000	You are right that my show is all about philosophy.
925000	927000	But whereas when I was
927000	929000	a 17 or 18 year old getting started,
929000	931000	my whole show, my whole stick
931000	933000	was doing the
933000	935000	well actually thing.
935000	937000	That commits that logical fallacy
937000	939000	and therefore that doesn't actually follow from that.
939000	941000	And you know what it worked? People liked it.
941000	943000	They thought, this is cool and they watched it.
943000	945000	The reason I'm saying this now is because
945000	947000	I'm not a 17 or 18 year old anymore.
947000	949000	I realized that that's not...
949000	951000	It's not what connects with me.
951000	953000	I can't remember where it comes from
953000	955000	but C.S. Lewis at one point
955000	957000	talks about how
957000	959000	when he made this shift, and what I'm trying to say is that
959000	961000	where I used to do that, I still talk about philosophy
961000	963000	but I am trying to encourage my audience
963000	965000	to instead of getting down
965000	967000	and analyzing every brush stroke
967000	969000	of a painting and trying to understand
969000	971000	the Mona Lisa by looking at it through a microscope
971000	973000	and trying to figure out what the pigment is
973000	975000	by just stepping back and looking at the picture
975000	977000	and realizing that that's what you were supposed to be doing all along.
977000	979000	C.S. Lewis when he made this kind of shift
979000	981000	because C.S. Lewis used to be an atheist.
981000	983000	He used to be the rationalist, atheist type
983000	985000	and then okay, he becomes a Christian
985000	987000	but before that he realizes the importance of narrative
987000	989000	and the non propositional
989000	991000	and he realized that he was being asked
991000	993000	by what I see
993000	995000	is now sort of the popular philosophical
995000	997000	analytic tradition. He's being asked
997000	999000	to deny that which is most real to him.
999000	1001000	Meaning
1001000	1003000	purpose, narrative
1003000	1005000	stories that connected with him
1005000	1007000	he was being asked to deny that
1007000	1009000	and accept as true the things that were most unreal to him
1009000	1011000	like numbers
1011000	1013000	and abstractions
1013000	1015000	and sort of geometric shapes that sort of exist
1015000	1017000	somewhere in the platonic form
1017000	1019000	the realm of forms or whatever
1019000	1021000	and that's just not how humans work.
1021000	1023000	So you're already on the C.S. Lewis journey then
1023000	1025000	you had two steps out of three
1025000	1027000	get you back here in ten years
1027000	1029000	You mentioned my previous
1029000	1031000	YouTube name, it's why one of my good friends used to call me
1031000	1033000	his second favorite C.S.
1033000	1035000	I
1035000	1037000	can't see something like that coming around the corner
1037000	1039000	but I've learned a lot from the man about
1039000	1041000	specifically this but C.S. Lewis himself
1041000	1043000	even being one of the most
1043000	1045000	prolific apologists
1045000	1047000	for Christianity in the world, realized
1047000	1049000	that it's not about the
1049000	1051000	the apologia, he wrote a poem
1051000	1053000	called The Apologist's Evening Prayer
1053000	1055000	which he imagines sitting down
1055000	1057000	and
1057000	1059000	those spending days and days
1059000	1061000	arguing successfully for God's existence
1061000	1063000	I can
1063000	1065000	do it if you want, it's like two paragraphs, it's quite short
1065000	1067000	I don't want to take too much time
1067000	1069000	he says from all my
1069000	1071000	lame defeats
1071000	1073000	and oh much more, from all the victories
1073000	1075000	I seemed to score
1075000	1077000	from cleverness shot forth on
1077000	1079000	thy behalf at which
1079000	1081000	whilst angels weep
1081000	1083000	the audience laugh
1083000	1085000	from all my proofs of thy divinity
1085000	1087000	thou who'd give no sign
1087000	1089000	deliver me
1089000	1091000	thoughts abut coins
1091000	1093000	let me not trust
1093000	1095000	instead of thee their thin worn
1095000	1097000	image of thy head
1097000	1099000	from all my thoughts even my
1099000	1101000	thoughts of thee
1101000	1103000	thou fair silence
1103000	1105000	fall and set me free
1105000	1107000	lord if the narrow gate and needles I
1107000	1109000	take from me all my trumpery
1109000	1111000	lest I die
1111000	1113000	and coming from C.S. Lewis
1113000	1115000	that is an extraordinary
1115000	1117000	revelation about
1117000	1119000	what all of this is really about
1119000	1121000	well you know we promise
1121000	1123000	surprises to have the
1123000	1125000	famous atheist quoting
1125000	1127000	beautiful C.S. Lewis poetry is a great beginning
1127000	1129000	to this conversation
1129000	1131000	John
1131000	1133000	you don't recite C.S. Lewis
1133000	1135000	what do you do to
1135000	1137000	are you a theist
1137000	1139000	are you a half way to being a theist
1139000	1141000	I would describe myself
1141000	1143000	as a non theist
1143000	1145000	a non theist thinks there
1145000	1147000	is still an open question
1147000	1149000	about the reference of words like sacredness
1149000	1151000	without
1151000	1153000	agreeing to the proposal
1153000	1155000	that the only way that can be captured
1155000	1157000	is by a supernatural
1157000	1159000	super thing super person
1159000	1161000	so that you could like
1161000	1163000	there are religions that
1163000	1165000	are properly non theistic like Taoism
1165000	1167000	Zen within Buddhism
1167000	1169000	things like that
1169000	1171000	I want to pick up on something Alex said
1171000	1173000	first of all
1173000	1175000	like you
1175000	1177000	I'm
1177000	1179000	very impressed with the
1179000	1181000	flexibility
1181000	1183000	and depth of Alex's thought
1183000	1185000	I want to pick up on
1185000	1187000	what he said about the non propositional
1187000	1189000	this is a big chunk of my work as a cognitive scientist
1189000	1191000	I have been arguing that there are
1191000	1193000	four kinds of knowing
1193000	1195000	there is one the propositional where Alex
1195000	1197000	is critiqued and each one of these
1197000	1199000	is a kind of memory
1199000	1201000	this is how we know that there are actually distinct things
1201000	1203000	and then there is your procedural memory
1203000	1205000	this is knowing how to do things
1205000	1207000	you knew how to walk and sit down
1207000	1209000	you didn't do that by writing an argument
1209000	1211000	that's a skill it's not a belief
1211000	1213000	it's a skill but it's a way of
1213000	1215000	being in contact with reality
1215000	1217000	then you have your perspectival knowing
1217000	1219000	you know how to notice things
1219000	1221000	how to focus your attention
1221000	1223000	how to be present or absent
1223000	1225000	with people
1225000	1227000	you know that
1227000	1229000	you have a kind of memory attached to this
1229000	1231000	this is your episodic memory
1231000	1233000	this is when you remember specific events
1233000	1235000	and the perspectives you took on them
1235000	1237000	and then there is a deeper kind of memory
1237000	1239000	that is called your participatory
1239000	1241000	memory or participatory knowing
1241000	1243000	this is you are knowing by how
1243000	1245000	you and the world fit together
1245000	1247000	given biological constraints
1247000	1249000	cultural constraints historical constraints
1249000	1251000	for example there was all kinds of things
1251000	1253000	laid out for you culturally and biologically
1253000	1255000	where that was all available to you
1255000	1257000	in which if I dropped you into Papua New Guinea
1257000	1259000	you'd be going like you wouldn't know
1259000	1261000	so all of those things
1261000	1263000	now why is that important given what Alex said
1263000	1265000	well the argument is
1265000	1267000	those non propositional kinds of knowing
1267000	1269000	are where most of your cognitive agency is
1269000	1271000	that's where most of your meaning making is
1271000	1273000	let me give you an example
1273000	1275000	we think we're talking
1275000	1277000	abstract thought
1277000	1279000	when we're talking propositional
1279000	1281000	listen to the word abstract lift out
1281000	1283000	moving around and progressing
1283000	1285000	through an argument or getting to the
1285000	1287000	end or what's underneath this argument
1287000	1289000	or what does it stand on or can I
1289000	1291000	we use all this language
1291000	1293000	and what's becoming apparent from cognitive
1293000	1295000	science is we take all of that
1295000	1297000	non propositional machinery that we use
1297000	1299000	for navigating the world
1299000	1301000	I mean like the physical world
1301000	1303000	and what we do is we bootstrap it up
1303000	1305000	into navigating the intellectual world
1305000	1307000	and so this world up here the abstract
1307000	1309000	world can't actually function
1309000	1311000	autonomously it has to constantly
1311000	1313000	get nourished
1313000	1315000	by the non propositional
1315000	1317000	that's what he did with the poem
1317000	1319000	so what do we
1319000	1321000	what do we do
1321000	1323000	with all of that how do we
1323000	1325000	well you stop bloody talking
1325000	1327000	all the time and you start doing other
1327000	1329000	things I mean isn't that a bad thing to say
1329000	1331000	at a conference right
1331000	1333000	but what you do is no you have
1333000	1335000	you have practices you have to do
1335000	1337000	individual and what the research is
1337000	1339000	doing you have to do collective
1339000	1341000	collaborative practices
1341000	1343000	so you know I do
1343000	1345000	Tai Chi Chuan I meditate
1345000	1347000	I contemplate I do a journaling practice
1347000	1349000	from stoicism and what you do
1349000	1351000	is you find sets of practices
1351000	1353000	and they there's formal reasons
1353000	1355000	for this but they have sets of strengths
1355000	1357000	and weaknesses and you try to get them
1357000	1359000	so that they're as self corrective as possible
1359000	1361000	so that you are comprehensively
1361000	1363000	intervening in this
1363000	1365000	meaning making machinery because here's
1365000	1367000	the thing it's not
1367000	1369000	it's not optional it will run
1369000	1371000	regardless of what you're doing up here
1371000	1373000	the issue is can you get it run
1373000	1375000	in a way that is actually at least
1375000	1377000	responsive to good
1377000	1379000	argument and evidence up here
1379000	1381000	and the answer is you can
1381000	1383000	it's not optional you can't like
1383000	1385000	I just won't pay any attention to that
1385000	1387000	that's not optional for you
1387000	1389000	but what you can do is make practices
1389000	1391000	this is like Plato you want to get
1391000	1393000	the man and the lion and the monster
1393000	1395000	properly talking to each other and a lot
1395000	1397000	of that talking isn't through speech
1397000	1399000	it's by engaging in
1399000	1401000	new ways of noticing
1401000	1403000	new ways
1403000	1405000	of taking a stance
1405000	1407000	towards a situation new ways
1407000	1409000	of assuming an identity and a role
1409000	1411000	in a situation it feels
1411000	1413000	somewhat mechanical though
1413000	1415000	doesn't it I mean both of these
1415000	1417000	processes
1417000	1419000	whether it's creating a task
1419000	1421000	that you can never quite conclude
1421000	1423000	what you talked about at the end
1423000	1425000	that offers a false promise
1425000	1427000	or engaging in practices
1427000	1429000	that almost seem to sort of trick your
1429000	1431000	so no no no I wouldn't say true
1431000	1433000	are they are you doing these
1433000	1435000	with a sense that there is a truth
1435000	1437000	that you are getting closer to
1437000	1439000	are you a is this a
1439000	1441000	purposeful faithful
1441000	1443000	activity well I'm going to challenge you
1443000	1445000	because you used the property of propositions
1445000	1447000	to ask me the question which means you're still prioritizing them
1447000	1449000	your skills aren't true
1449000	1451000	or false they're powerful or not
1451000	1453000	and power is another way we judge
1453000	1455000	realness your perspectives aren't
1455000	1457000	true or not it's whether or not
1457000	1459000	they make you feel present in a situation
1459000	1461000	like and you're
1461000	1463000	foregrounding the right things and backgrounding
1463000	1465000	the right things are you taking
1465000	1467000	the right role that your participatory knowing
1467000	1469000	that's real because if you don't take the right
1469000	1471000	role you can't engage
1471000	1473000	with the correct set of problems that you're being faced
1473000	1475000	and you can't be responsible in the
1475000	1477000	appropriate manner these are all different
1477000	1479000	we don't have a single sense of
1479000	1481000	realness we have multiple senses
1481000	1483000	of realness and part of what I think
1483000	1485000	we're trying to do is
1485000	1487000	relearn how to re-coordinate
1487000	1489000	those senses of realnesses so they
1489000	1491000	are not operating
1491000	1493000	orthogonally or antagonistically
1493000	1495000	but so they're mutually correcting and affording each other
1495000	1497000	so that we get the fullest possible
1497000	1499000	connectedness to what we think
1499000	1501000	is most reliably real
1501000	1503000	not just abstractly but in the guts
1503000	1505000	of our lives
1505000	1507000	putting all that together
1507000	1509000	and trying to zoom out
1509000	1511000	to look at how
1511000	1513000	the whole of society might
1513000	1515000	or might not shift
1515000	1517000	do you think we're screwed
1517000	1519000	do you think are we
1519000	1521000	going to have millions of people engaging
1521000	1523000	in this kind of purposeful activity and therefore
1523000	1525000	changing the
1525000	1527000	direction of the meaning crisis
1527000	1529000	or do you think we are headed in a
1529000	1531000	direction that only gets worse
1531000	1533000	I think we're screwed as long as people keep
1533000	1535000	looking in the wrong place
1535000	1537000	and that place
1537000	1539000	is this realm of the propositional
1539000	1541000	that's why I think John and I
1541000	1543000	get on so well in our podcast that we did together
1543000	1545000	as well because this is something we can
1545000	1547000	completely agree on that
1547000	1549000	obviously sorry to
1549000	1551000	disappoint you I can't tell you how to find
1551000	1553000	meaning that's not something that I'm
1553000	1555000	going to be able to do in 6 minutes and 53 seconds
1555000	1557000	and I don't think anybody seriously thinks
1557000	1559000	that I'm going to be able to do that
1559000	1561000	but you're still here listening we just want to
1561000	1563000	talk about what meaning is so I can't tell you
1563000	1565000	where it is found but I can
1565000	1567000	tell you where it's not and it's not found
1567000	1569000	at the bottom of a microscope
1569000	1571000	it's not found in these
1571000	1573000	syllogisms people don't
1573000	1575000	anything that brings people meaning
1575000	1577000	being talked into it all being
1577000	1579000	talked out of it never happens
1579000	1581000	rarely happens
1581000	1583000	because of syllogistic
1583000	1585000	argumentation it's something else
1585000	1587000	I was reading Leo Tolstoy's
1587000	1589000	Confession it's a wonderful
1589000	1591000	it's brilliant it's only like 100 pages
1591000	1593000	and he talks about how he was
1593000	1595000	he knew somebody who'd been on a camp
1595000	1597000	with his brother or something
1597000	1599000	and it stunned me as well because it was so long
1599000	1601000	ago it reads as if they're talking about the modern
1601000	1603000	world and its abandonment of religion due to
1603000	1605000	technology and all of this kind of stuff
1605000	1607000	but this is Tolstoy and he says that this friend
1607000	1609000	he's up with his brother
1609000	1611000	and they're in a tent and at the end of the night
1611000	1613000	he sort of bows down to pray do his nightly
1613000	1615000	prayers like they were trained to do his children
1615000	1617000	and his brother says
1617000	1619000	do you still do that
1619000	1621000	and that question alone
1621000	1623000	that just that was enough
1623000	1625000	such that that man never got down on his knees
1625000	1627000	and prayed ever again
1627000	1629000	there's no argument there's something
1629000	1631000	that isn't syllogized
1631000	1633000	that's sort of brought about by that kind of attitude
1633000	1635000	that completely changed his mind
1635000	1637000	and Tolstoy himself concluded that
1637000	1639000	while looking for questions of meaning he realized
1639000	1641000	that the more precise the answer
1641000	1643000	the less interesting the answer was
1643000	1645000	and the closer it was
1645000	1647000	to answering the question that he was interested in
1647000	1649000	the more vague it necessarily became
1649000	1651000	you know I can tell you
1651000	1653000	in principle exactly how many
1653000	1655000	molecules are in that jug of water over there
1655000	1657000	but who cares
1657000	1659000	it doesn't mean anything
1659000	1661000	and I think we're sort of stuck
1661000	1663000	the reason that we are sort of perpetually screwed
1663000	1665000	is because of that sort of
1665000	1667000	that
1667000	1669000	discorrelation that anti-correlation
1669000	1671000	that the more specific the answer becomes
1671000	1673000	the less
1673000	1675000	interesting a question is answering
1675000	1677000	with relation to meaning wherever meaning is
1677000	1679000	in other words it has to sort of lie
1679000	1681000	within the gaps there
1681000	1683000	and that's an old story
1683000	1685000	that's nothing new
1685000	1687000	Is that pessimistic or optimistic
1687000	1689000	I'm trying to work it out
1689000	1691000	what is the answer to while we screwed
1691000	1693000	I mean do you think
1693000	1695000	we're putting all that together
1695000	1697000	we have a secular society
1697000	1699000	the numbers for religious faith
1699000	1701000	are continuing to plummet
1701000	1703000	do you think there are mechanisms
1703000	1705000	narratives
1705000	1707000	poems
1707000	1709000	structures
1709000	1711000	that will help rebuild
1711000	1713000	something out of this
1713000	1715000	because look I'm speaking very
1715000	1717000	the people who have said
1717000	1719000	that I'm on some kind of C.S. Lewis conversion
1719000	1721000	story might get excited by the things I'm saying
1721000	1723000	don't be fooled
1723000	1725000	the reason I talk about religion so much
1725000	1727000	is just because it's the best example
1727000	1729000	of a narrative of a story
1729000	1731000	but the thing that's providing
1731000	1733000	the meaning
1733000	1735000	the thing that I think is causing people
1735000	1737000	to not be despairing
1737000	1739000	if they're really sort of
1739000	1741000	head first into this religious stuff
1741000	1743000	it's not because of the religion
1743000	1745000	the thing that makes religion different
1745000	1747000	from any other form of narrative is its propositional content
1747000	1749000	the belief in a God
1749000	1751000	the belief in a specific set of ethical codes
1751000	1753000	I've already said that that I don't think is the important thing
1753000	1755000	the important thing is the narrative
1755000	1757000	the reason the United States did so well for a time
1757000	1759000	in this foundational nation myth
1759000	1761000	the meaning
1761000	1763000	in an American's life
1763000	1765000	after the Revolutionary War
1765000	1767000	was not found in the fact that
1767000	1769000	Washington swears in on a Bible
1769000	1771000	but because the man who's swearing in is himself
1771000	1773000	something of a mythical figure
1773000	1775000	but it seems to have lost confidence in that myth
1775000	1777000	and so you point to
1777000	1779000	the crisis of secularism
1779000	1781000	in modern America
1781000	1783000	is it secularism or is it just a loss of narrative
1783000	1785000	if we'd have gotten rid of the God stuff
1785000	1787000	this real attachment
1787000	1789000	people often quote or used to quote
1789000	1791000	the founding fathers of this nation
1791000	1793000	as if they were quoting Hadiths of the Prophet Muhammad
1793000	1795000	an argument was
1795000	1797000	settled in politics
1797000	1799000	by figuring out what the founding fathers thought
1799000	1801000	can you imagine that today
1801000	1803000	in a debate today someone says
1803000	1805000	Thomas Jefferson thought there should be
1805000	1807000	a separation between churches
1807000	1809000	who cares what Thomas Jefferson thought
1809000	1811000	these were sort of crazy
1811000	1813000	white old men and that's how people see it now
1813000	1815000	so the thing that's lost is not necessarily religion
1815000	1817000	it's this American narrative
1817000	1819000	it's the narrative that's important now I think
1819000	1821000	John do you think
1821000	1823000	we're coming to the conclusion of this
1823000	1825000	half hour
1825000	1827000	do you think there are narratives
1827000	1829000	that are on the up
1829000	1831000	do you think there is cause
1831000	1833000	to feel like this is not just a
1833000	1835000	downward trajectory
1835000	1837000	I think there's increasing sign
1837000	1839000	for
1839000	1841000	what I call the advent of the sacred
1841000	1843000	people who
1843000	1845000	I'm in conversation with them
1845000	1847000	and I both study them scientifically and participate
1847000	1849000	with them there's all these emerging
1849000	1851000	communities of practices all these
1851000	1853000	new ways in which people
1853000	1855000	are trying to
1855000	1857000	get at
1857000	1859000	a home for their desire to connect
1859000	1861000	and to transcend
1861000	1863000	sort of the prison of their egocentric
1863000	1865000	way of life
1865000	1867000	and they
1867000	1869000	are generally
1869000	1871000	open to the fact that they think
1871000	1873000	the traditional way of talking
1873000	1875000	isn't working for them
1875000	1877000	the fastest demographic group
1877000	1879000	fastest growing demographic group are the nuns
1879000	1881000	the NONES's
1881000	1883000	they'll overtake Christianity
1883000	1885000	in the United States probably in the next
1885000	1887000	two decades or so
1887000	1889000	something like that or maybe a little bit longer
1889000	1891000	and these people are not
1891000	1893000	by and large
1893000	1895000	sort of
1895000	1897000	just dyed in the wool analytic atheists
1897000	1899000	they're very much
1899000	1901000	you know people like Alex
1901000	1903000	people who are
1903000	1905000	I think appropriately called seeking
1905000	1907000	they're seeking in some way they're open
1907000	1909000	they're trying to
1909000	1911000	consider new ways of thinking about this
1911000	1913000	and
1913000	1915000	I think that is predicting that there is going to be
1915000	1917000	a fundamental
1917000	1919000	change I mean barring
1919000	1921000	that we don't destroy the world and other things along the way
1923000	1925000	because any attempt to
1925000	1927000	and this would be my critique of all ideological
1927000	1929000	political endeavors
1929000	1931000	any attempt to top down this into existence
1931000	1933000	is going to fail this has got to
1933000	1935000	bottom up it's got to come up
1935000	1937000	like I said out of that non propositional
1937000	1939000	out of people doing new practices
1939000	1941000	forming new kinds of communities
1941000	1943000	then the narratives
1943000	1945000	will be born they'll be born out of that
1945000	1947000	they can't just be made and imposed
1947000	1949000	on people or sold to people
1949000	1951000	that won't take that won't work
1951000	1953000	ladies and gentlemen
1953000	1955000	thank you so much to
1955000	1957000	both of our panelists
1957000	1959000	on this conversation
