 In this discussion, the participants explore the role of narrative and meaning in a secular society where religious faith is declining. They consider whether there are emerging narratives or structures that can provide a sense of the sacred and offer meaning to individuals in the absence of traditional religious frameworks.

The panelists discuss the importance of narratives, not just the propositional content of religious beliefs, but the stories and myths that give people a sense of purpose and identity. They reflect on the American foundational narrative as an example of such a powerful story, though they also acknowledge that this narrative has lost its potency in modern America.

One panelist, John, argues that there is evidence for a resurgence of the sacred or spirituality in new forms. He points out that the NONES—people who do not identify with any particular religion—are the fastest-growing demographic in the United States. These individuals are often open to exploring spiritual practices and communities, suggesting a bottom-up shift towards new forms of meaning-making.

The panelists agree that any attempt to impose top-down narratives or ideologies will likely fail because people need to organically form communities and engage in practices that resonate with their experiences. The conclusion is that the next wave of meaningful narratives will emerge from these grassroots movements, rather than being dictated by established institutions or imposed by authorities.

The conversation emphasizes the importance of allowing for this organic development of narrative and meaning as a response to the challenges of a secularizing world. It also suggests caution, urging that such shifts not be derailed by external threats like environmental disasters or other global issues. The panelists seem optimistic about the potential for new narratives to emerge from the current shift in societal values and individual spiritual seeking.
