1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Is it secularism or is it just a loss of narrative?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
If we'd have gotten rid of the God stuff, but kept this real attachment,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I mean, people often quote or used to quote the founding fathers of this nation

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
as if they were quoting Hadiths of the Prophet Muhammad.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Like, they've just, like, an argument was settled in politics

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
by figuring out what the founding fathers thought.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Can you imagine that today? In a debate today, someone says,

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
ah, but didn't you know that, you know, that Thomas Jefferson

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
thought there should be a separation between churches?

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Who cares what Thomas Jefferson thought?

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
You know, these were sort of, you know, crazy white old men

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and that's how people see it now, right?

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And so the thing that's lost is not necessarily religion.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It's this American narrative.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It's the narrative that's important now, I think.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We don't have a socially recognized, legitimated home

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
outside of the religions for people who want to ameliorate their foolishness,

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
who want to enhance their connectedness.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
If you'll allow me a little bit, a high-fluten word,

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
who want to cultivate wisdom.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Some people are saying that atheism is going out of fashion.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You are doing a good job of trying to bring it back into fashion.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Do you find something in that atheistic philosophical line of inquiry

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
to fill your soul?

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I think we're screwed as long as people keep looking in the wrong place.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And that place is this realm of the propositional, right?

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You stop bloody talking all the time and you start doing other things.

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I mean, isn't that a bad thing to say at a conference?

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
My name is Freddie Sayers. I'm in charge of Unheard.

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
We are partnering this weekend with the Amazing Discipline Dialogues.

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Thanks, everyone, for making out to this extraordinary place.

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
We've struggled to find a way.

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
What an opportunity we have now for the next couple of days

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
to actually get to know each other and have proper conversations.

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And I personally am really, really excited about it.

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Without further ado, our first panel, our first deep dive,

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
we're going off the deep end straight away today,

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
is addressing the question of meaning.

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
And to help us do that, we have two amazing people.

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
The first you will know as Cosmic Skeptic,

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
but he is no longer Cosmic Skeptic.

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
He's an artist formerly known as Cosmic Skeptic.

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
He's Alex O'Connor.

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And he is joining John Vaveke,

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
who is a professor of psychology from the University of Toronto,

46
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
who has coined...

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
John Serebio.

48
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You might know John's YouTube series,

49
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Awakening from the Meaning Crisis.

50
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So this question, we could not have two better people to help us of.

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
That's it.

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So, what do we do when we don't go to church?

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Is there underlying all of these cultural wars,

54
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
political crises, identity crises,

55
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
some big, hard to define question,

56
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
which is basically the gap where religion used to be.

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Will people come to big industrial buildings in Brooklyn

58
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
to gather and find meaning in the future, do we think?

59
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Alex O'Connor, is there a meaning crisis?

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I want to say yes.

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I want to say a misleading yes,

62
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
because I think that people often...

63
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I think the title of this panel is Finding Meaning in a Secular Age.

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm not sure that the meaning crisis that we're in

65
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
is strictly due to or related to secularism in particular.

66
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I think that if there is a meaning crisis,

67
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
it can be described as the human condition.

68
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
If you look at what people say on some self-help YouTube video

69
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
about Albert Camus talking about going into work,

70
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
coming home, tide comes in, tide goes out,

71
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
sun up, sun down, and none of it means anything.

72
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Sure, you can find that there,

73
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
but you can also find it in the book of Ecclesiastes.

74
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
This isn't a new thing.

75
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And so when people talk about the meaning crisis

76
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
and feel a bit pessimistic about the fact that, you know,

77
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
they're struggling to find a reason to be and a reason to act,

78
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
the first thing that I'd like to point out

79
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
is that this isn't some modern phenomenon.

80
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's exacerbated by new specific modern phenomena,

81
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
social media, phone addiction, this kind of stuff.

82
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
But the idea of, like, struggling to find meaning

83
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
is no new problem.

84
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So you're an atheist?

85
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Yes.

86
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
A proud atheist?

87
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
A reluctant atheist.

88
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Where do you get your meaning from?

89
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Well, I was trying to think about what meaning actually means,

90
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
and generally when talking about it,

91
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I try to give some, like, clever-sounding academic definition,

92
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
but I was reading Blaise Pascal's Ponce, The Thoughts.

93
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's a marvellous, marvellous volume,

94
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
and I don't think it was ever supposed to be published,

95
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
but in the first part, Man Without God,

96
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
he talks about the concept of boredom.

97
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
There's this wonderful passage on the concept of boredom,

98
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
and he says, it's where you get this famous quote

99
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
that all of man's troubles spring from his inability

100
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
to sit alone in a room in silence,

101
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
and he imagines somebody who tries to pass their boredom

102
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
by gambling.

103
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Every day, he goes and places a stake

104
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
in the hopes that he'll win some money,

105
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
and this is how he stops himself from being bored.

106
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
And Pascal says, well, give this man all of the money

107
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
that he could have won in the gambling game

108
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
on the condition that he can't play anymore,

109
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
and you'll make him unhappy,

110
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
because there's no thrill in it, there's no excitement.

111
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Okay, so he doesn't just want to win the money,

112
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
he wants to play the game.

113
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Okay, says Pascal, allow him to play the game,

114
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
but he's guaranteed not to win the money.

115
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You're also going to make him upset.

116
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Okay, so what is it then?

117
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Something like not having the thing desired,

118
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
along with the illusion that once you achieve the thing

119
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
that's desired, it's going to make you happy,

120
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
but because having the thing on its own

121
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
isn't actually going to make you happy,

122
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
you also need to not have it.

123
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
So meaning has to be something like

124
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
that slightly self-deceptive position

125
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
of identifying happiness in something you don't have,

126
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
believing that you can achieve it,

127
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
and then constantly not achieve it, right?

128
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Because it used to be the case that the things that...

129
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I mean, with the sort of centers of meaning,

130
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
the self-help stuff that I was mentioning a moment ago,

131
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
they say, you know, seek discomfort, cold showers,

132
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
and go to the gym and eat healthily and this kind of thing,

133
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
and it's because, you know, it used to be that when you wake up,

134
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
it was a gamble.

135
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You don't know if you're going to have a shelter over your head,

136
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
you don't know if you're going to have food to eat every single day,

137
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
the thing resets.

138
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Now, you've got the money without the game,

139
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
you've got the food, you've got the shelter, you're fine.

140
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So what people are doing is they're seeking out the game

141
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
without the prize.

142
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
This is why religion does it so well,

143
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
because religion is the definition of something

144
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
which you don't have now,

145
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
and for your entire life will not have,

146
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
and yet believe that you can have

147
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
and think that that thing is desirable.

148
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
That must be the thing that religion serves.

149
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
So, look, I was really happy to be invited and speak here,

150
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
and I think it's wonderful,

151
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
but when somebody asks me where do I find my meaning,

152
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm as much in this struggle as anybody else.

153
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
There's nothing that I can do to help you find it,

154
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
except for firstly helping to try and recognize

155
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
what it is that we're actually looking for,

156
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
and I think it's maybe something like that.

157
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
John, do you recognize that struggle, that description,

158
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
or do you have a bit more of a sort of purposeful view of it?

159
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Well, no, I mean, I respect Alex what he's saying,

160
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
and I think there's important truths in it.

161
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I would say initially, I agree with Alex,

162
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
there's a perennial problem of meaning.

163
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Ecclesiastes or books of the same ilk,

164
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
and I think this has to do with the fact

165
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
that we are perennially prone to despair,

166
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
because the very processes that make us intelligently adaptive

167
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
also make us perpetually susceptible to self-deception,

168
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
and we can get bound up and cut off

169
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
and disconnected from ourselves and other people.

170
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
So, I think there's definitely a perennial aspect,

171
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
cross-cultural, cross-historical aspect to it.

172
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I think what's specific about what I call the meaning crisis

173
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
is that those perennial problems

174
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
usually have had perennial solutions.

175
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
There have been, and the solutions are not

176
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
what we call belief systems.

177
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
They are systems, or better, make it more sort of dynamic.

178
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Ecologies of practices, ways of transforming consciousness,

179
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
cognition, character, community,

180
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
they give people a sense that they're ameliorating

181
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
this self-deception and enhancing their connectedness

182
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
to themselves, to other people, to the world.

183
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And those ecologies of practices have been housed

184
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
in various things, or homed is better.

185
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
They've been homed in religions,

186
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
but they've also been homed in these things

187
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
that sort of hang on the border between philosophy and religion,

188
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
like Buddhism and Taoism, and maybe stoicism.

189
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And so what seems to be the case, though,

190
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,000
is we don't have a socially recognized,

191
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
legitimated home outside of the religions

192
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
for people who want to ameliorate their foolishness,

193
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
who want to enhance their connectedness,

194
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
if you'll allow me a little bit, a high-fluten word,

195
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
who want to cultivate wisdom.

196
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And because of that, and that has to do with

197
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
some very important historical factors.

198
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Do you think it's new, though?

199
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Alex was saying it's been around forever.

200
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Just a mile away, we have the Columbia campus.

201
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It has nothing to do with this conversation in a way,

202
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
but the intensity of the political disagreement,

203
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
the sense that people are fundamentally unreconciled,

204
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
do you think that is just another manifestation of this?

205
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Do you think we are in a particularly...

206
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Very much, and I think from an anthropological point of view,

207
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
not a theological point of view,

208
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
from an anthropological point of view,

209
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
these are religious events.

210
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
These are people...

211
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Well, I want to do what Alex said.

212
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
What is it that we're seeking, we're seeking meaning?

213
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
So in cognitive science and psychology,

214
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
we try to distinguish between the meaning of life,

215
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
which is some grand metaphysical claim,

216
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
and meaning in life,

217
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
and philosophers like Susan Wolfe and others.

218
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
So what this is is that it sort of has a bunch of factors,

219
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
but one is, does the world make sense to you?

220
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Think of all the things you have in a video game,

221
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
and why people want to be in video games.

222
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Does the world make sense to you?

223
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Is there a story that you can play a part in,

224
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
and is there a way for you to level up,

225
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
for you to get better as a person,

226
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
like to enhance your agency?

227
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And so it's this fundamental sense of connectedness.

228
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
And so you can determine meaning in life

229
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
by asking people three questions.

230
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
What do you want to exist even if you don't?

231
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
How really real is it,

232
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
what's the difference to you make to it now?

233
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
These people in these events,

234
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
they want to connect to something,

235
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
a cause that's bigger than themselves,

236
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
and they want it to exist.

237
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
They think the universe is a better place

238
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
if this cause is there.

239
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
They think it's really real.

240
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
They think these are real events.

241
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
This is significant, important.

242
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
This isn't like going to the store and buying milk.

243
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And they think they can make a difference

244
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
by participating in it, committing to it.

245
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And so I think it's very much,

246
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
an act about trying to get this connectedness.

247
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
And the fervor means

248
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
that it's being driven by a tinge of anxiety,

249
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
a tinge of hunger,

250
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
a tinge even of potential despair.

251
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I mean, they would say,

252
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
if they were here right now on this panel,

253
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
they'd be pretty cross

254
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
by that suggestion, I think,

255
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
because they would say there are big problems.

256
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
These are issues which they're engaged with

257
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
in a practical way.

258
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Alex, do you look at the news?

259
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Do you look at stuff happening like in Colombia?

260
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
There are now these,

261
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
what appear to be completely

262
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
unrecognizable battles.

263
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Do you

264
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
see something existential

265
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
in them? Or do you think it's just

266
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
politics or cultural war?

267
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Well, existentialism is always

268
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
sort of at the basis of

269
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
of political and cultural disputes.

270
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
There's always something, there's always some like

271
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
bedrock that people are working from.

272
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Because if they weren't, then you could just solve these disputes

273
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
by using reason. You could just sort of figure out

274
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
what that disagreement is, figure out who

275
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
most agrees with the

276
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
bedrock that you both share, and there you go,

277
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
like problem solved. But no, there's some kind of

278
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
philosophical

279
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
bedrock. The thing that people are looking for,

280
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
the reason why you can't just argue people out of this stuff,

281
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
and it's something that I've spoken to John about before,

282
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
and I think we'll agree on, is that

283
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
wherever this meaning thing exists,

284
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
if you look at traditional centers of meaning,

285
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
art and poetry and religion,

286
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
like one of the unifying features

287
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
is that it is non-propositional.

288
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It's not something that you put into a syllogism,

289
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
it's not something that you sort of rationalize and argue.

290
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Will you just explain what that means?

291
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
So, it's like,

292
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
the way I'll explain it is, I imagine,

293
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I kind of wanted to make like a sketch.

294
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
What I'm trying to say is that

295
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
the way of doing philosophy that

296
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
arises with the analytic philosophical tradition,

297
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
so trying to translate all philosophy

298
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
into

299
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
if p then q, p

300
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
therefore q, like that rationally

301
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
follows logical deduction, that kind of stuff.

302
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
This is not how people interact with the world.

303
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
This is not how people behave.

304
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
If you open the Bible, you do not find a single syllogism.

305
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Like, this is not why people come to believe in God.

306
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
This is probably something you'll talk about

307
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
with Richard Dawkins and Ayan Hirsi Ali.

308
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I imagined, for example, this sketch I wanted to make.

309
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
There's like a man

310
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
who is in desperation

311
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
about to throw himself off a bridge,

312
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
and someone comes up to him and says,

313
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
what are you doing? You know?

314
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
And he says, I'm just so hopeless, you know?

315
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Life has no meaning. And the guy says,

316
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
have you ever thought about the question of God?

317
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
And he says, you know, I've thought about it sometimes.

318
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Maybe I feel like I'm being listened to.

319
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
And then he recites a poem to him.

320
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
And he's overwhelmed with beauty.

321
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And he considers getting off of the ledge.

322
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
And the man talks him through this narrative.

323
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
He tells him about his own struggles with meaning and purpose.

324
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
And the man's like, okay, you know,

325
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I feel heard. I feel seen.

326
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
And he's about to climb back over the ledge.

327
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
But then he remembers that

328
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
the principle of sufficient reason fails

329
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
because of modal fatalism in the academy.

330
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
So he throws himself off the bridge.

331
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It's not how people think.

332
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It's not how people behave, right?

333
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Like Keith says that...

334
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
He says, do not all charms fly

335
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
at the mere touch

336
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
of cold philosophy.

337
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Philosophy will clip an angel's wings,

338
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
conquer all mysteries

339
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
by rule and line.

340
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
But you have a whole show devoted to philosophy.

341
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
This is your topic.

342
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Yes.

343
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Is that the time?

344
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I think...

345
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Yeah, I do.

346
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Presumably you find it helps you.

347
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I'm really fascinated to know

348
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
you are...

349
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Some people are saying that atheism

350
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
is going out of fashion.

351
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
You are doing a good job

352
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
of trying to bring it back into fashion.

353
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Do you

354
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
find something in that

355
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
atheistic philosophical line of inquiry

356
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
to

357
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
fill your soul?

358
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
But atheism doesn't really have

359
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
that kind of content.

360
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Right?

361
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
You are right that my show is all about philosophy.

362
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
But whereas when I was

363
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
a 17 or 18 year old getting started,

364
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
my whole show, my whole stick

365
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
was doing the

366
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
well actually thing.

367
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
That commits that logical fallacy

368
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
and therefore that doesn't actually follow from that.

369
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
And you know what it worked? People liked it.

370
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
They thought, this is cool and they watched it.

371
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
The reason I'm saying this now is because

372
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I'm not a 17 or 18 year old anymore.

373
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I realized that that's not...

374
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
It's not what connects with me.

375
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I can't remember where it comes from

376
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
but C.S. Lewis at one point

377
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
talks about how

378
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
when he made this shift, and what I'm trying to say is that

379
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
where I used to do that, I still talk about philosophy

380
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
but I am trying to encourage my audience

381
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
to instead of getting down

382
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
and analyzing every brush stroke

383
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
of a painting and trying to understand

384
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
the Mona Lisa by looking at it through a microscope

385
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
and trying to figure out what the pigment is

386
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
by just stepping back and looking at the picture

387
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
and realizing that that's what you were supposed to be doing all along.

388
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
C.S. Lewis when he made this kind of shift

389
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
because C.S. Lewis used to be an atheist.

390
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
He used to be the rationalist, atheist type

391
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
and then okay, he becomes a Christian

392
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
but before that he realizes the importance of narrative

393
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
and the non propositional

394
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
and he realized that he was being asked

395
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
by what I see

396
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
is now sort of the popular philosophical

397
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
analytic tradition. He's being asked

398
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
to deny that which is most real to him.

399
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Meaning

400
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
purpose, narrative

401
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
stories that connected with him

402
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
he was being asked to deny that

403
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
and accept as true the things that were most unreal to him

404
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
like numbers

405
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
and abstractions

406
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
and sort of geometric shapes that sort of exist

407
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
somewhere in the platonic form

408
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
the realm of forms or whatever

409
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
and that's just not how humans work.

410
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
So you're already on the C.S. Lewis journey then

411
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
you had two steps out of three

412
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
get you back here in ten years

413
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
You mentioned my previous

414
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
YouTube name, it's why one of my good friends used to call me

415
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
his second favorite C.S.

416
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I

417
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
can't see something like that coming around the corner

418
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
but I've learned a lot from the man about

419
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
specifically this but C.S. Lewis himself

420
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
even being one of the most

421
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
prolific apologists

422
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
for Christianity in the world, realized

423
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
that it's not about the

424
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
the apologia, he wrote a poem

425
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
called The Apologist's Evening Prayer

426
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
which he imagines sitting down

427
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
and

428
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
those spending days and days

429
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
arguing successfully for God's existence

430
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I can

431
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
do it if you want, it's like two paragraphs, it's quite short

432
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I don't want to take too much time

433
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
he says from all my

434
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
lame defeats

435
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
and oh much more, from all the victories

436
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I seemed to score

437
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
from cleverness shot forth on

438
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
thy behalf at which

439
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
whilst angels weep

440
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
the audience laugh

441
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
from all my proofs of thy divinity

442
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
thou who'd give no sign

443
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
deliver me

444
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
thoughts abut coins

445
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
let me not trust

446
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
instead of thee their thin worn

447
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
image of thy head

448
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
from all my thoughts even my

449
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
thoughts of thee

450
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
thou fair silence

451
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
fall and set me free

452
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
lord if the narrow gate and needles I

453
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
take from me all my trumpery

454
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
lest I die

455
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
and coming from C.S. Lewis

456
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
that is an extraordinary

457
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
revelation about

458
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
what all of this is really about

459
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
well you know we promise

460
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
surprises to have the

461
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
famous atheist quoting

462
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
beautiful C.S. Lewis poetry is a great beginning

463
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
to this conversation

464
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
John

465
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
you don't recite C.S. Lewis

466
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
what do you do to

467
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
are you a theist

468
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
are you a half way to being a theist

469
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I would describe myself

470
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
as a non theist

471
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
a non theist thinks there

472
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
is still an open question

473
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
about the reference of words like sacredness

474
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
without

475
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
agreeing to the proposal

476
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
that the only way that can be captured

477
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
is by a supernatural

478
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
super thing super person

479
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
so that you could like

480
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
there are religions that

481
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
are properly non theistic like Taoism

482
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Zen within Buddhism

483
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
things like that

484
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I want to pick up on something Alex said

485
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
first of all

486
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
like you

487
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I'm

488
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
very impressed with the

489
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
flexibility

490
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
and depth of Alex's thought

491
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I want to pick up on

492
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
what he said about the non propositional

493
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
this is a big chunk of my work as a cognitive scientist

494
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I have been arguing that there are

495
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
four kinds of knowing

496
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
there is one the propositional where Alex

497
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
is critiqued and each one of these

498
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
is a kind of memory

499
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
this is how we know that there are actually distinct things

500
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
and then there is your procedural memory

501
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
this is knowing how to do things

502
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
you knew how to walk and sit down

503
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
you didn't do that by writing an argument

504
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
that's a skill it's not a belief

505
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
it's a skill but it's a way of

506
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
being in contact with reality

507
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
then you have your perspectival knowing

508
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
you know how to notice things

509
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
how to focus your attention

510
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
how to be present or absent

511
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
with people

512
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
you know that

513
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
you have a kind of memory attached to this

514
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
this is your episodic memory

515
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
this is when you remember specific events

516
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
and the perspectives you took on them

517
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
and then there is a deeper kind of memory

518
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
that is called your participatory

519
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
memory or participatory knowing

520
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
this is you are knowing by how

521
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
you and the world fit together

522
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
given biological constraints

523
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
cultural constraints historical constraints

524
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
for example there was all kinds of things

525
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
laid out for you culturally and biologically

526
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
where that was all available to you

527
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
in which if I dropped you into Papua New Guinea

528
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
you'd be going like you wouldn't know

529
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
so all of those things

530
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
now why is that important given what Alex said

531
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
well the argument is

532
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
those non propositional kinds of knowing

533
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
are where most of your cognitive agency is

534
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
that's where most of your meaning making is

535
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
let me give you an example

536
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
we think we're talking

537
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
abstract thought

538
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
when we're talking propositional

539
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
listen to the word abstract lift out

540
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
moving around and progressing

541
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
through an argument or getting to the

542
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
end or what's underneath this argument

543
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
or what does it stand on or can I

544
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
we use all this language

545
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
and what's becoming apparent from cognitive

546
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
science is we take all of that

547
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
non propositional machinery that we use

548
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
for navigating the world

549
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I mean like the physical world

550
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
and what we do is we bootstrap it up

551
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
into navigating the intellectual world

552
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
and so this world up here the abstract

553
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
world can't actually function

554
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
autonomously it has to constantly

555
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
get nourished

556
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
by the non propositional

557
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
that's what he did with the poem

558
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
so what do we

559
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
what do we do

560
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
with all of that how do we

561
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
well you stop bloody talking

562
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
all the time and you start doing other

563
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
things I mean isn't that a bad thing to say

564
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
at a conference right

565
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
but what you do is no you have

566
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
you have practices you have to do

567
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
individual and what the research is

568
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
doing you have to do collective

569
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
collaborative practices

570
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
so you know I do

571
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Tai Chi Chuan I meditate

572
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I contemplate I do a journaling practice

573
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
from stoicism and what you do

574
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
is you find sets of practices

575
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
and they there's formal reasons

576
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
for this but they have sets of strengths

577
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
and weaknesses and you try to get them

578
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
so that they're as self corrective as possible

579
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
so that you are comprehensively

580
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
intervening in this

581
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
meaning making machinery because here's

582
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
the thing it's not

583
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
it's not optional it will run

584
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
regardless of what you're doing up here

585
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
the issue is can you get it run

586
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
in a way that is actually at least

587
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
responsive to good

588
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
argument and evidence up here

589
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
and the answer is you can

590
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
it's not optional you can't like

591
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I just won't pay any attention to that

592
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
that's not optional for you

593
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
but what you can do is make practices

594
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
this is like Plato you want to get

595
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
the man and the lion and the monster

596
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
properly talking to each other and a lot

597
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
of that talking isn't through speech

598
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
it's by engaging in

599
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
new ways of noticing

600
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
new ways

601
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
of taking a stance

602
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
towards a situation new ways

603
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
of assuming an identity and a role

604
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
in a situation it feels

605
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
somewhat mechanical though

606
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
doesn't it I mean both of these

607
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
processes

608
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
whether it's creating a task

609
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
that you can never quite conclude

610
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
what you talked about at the end

611
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
that offers a false promise

612
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
or engaging in practices

613
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
that almost seem to sort of trick your

614
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
so no no no I wouldn't say true

615
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
are they are you doing these

616
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
with a sense that there is a truth

617
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
that you are getting closer to

618
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
are you a is this a

619
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
purposeful faithful

620
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
activity well I'm going to challenge you

621
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
because you used the property of propositions

622
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
to ask me the question which means you're still prioritizing them

623
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
your skills aren't true

624
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
or false they're powerful or not

625
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
and power is another way we judge

626
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
realness your perspectives aren't

627
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
true or not it's whether or not

628
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
they make you feel present in a situation

629
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
like and you're

630
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
foregrounding the right things and backgrounding

631
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
the right things are you taking

632
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
the right role that your participatory knowing

633
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
that's real because if you don't take the right

634
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
role you can't engage

635
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
with the correct set of problems that you're being faced

636
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
and you can't be responsible in the

637
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
appropriate manner these are all different

638
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
we don't have a single sense of

639
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
realness we have multiple senses

640
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
of realness and part of what I think

641
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
we're trying to do is

642
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
relearn how to re-coordinate

643
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
those senses of realnesses so they

644
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
are not operating

645
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
orthogonally or antagonistically

646
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
but so they're mutually correcting and affording each other

647
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
so that we get the fullest possible

648
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
connectedness to what we think

649
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
is most reliably real

650
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
not just abstractly but in the guts

651
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
of our lives

652
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
putting all that together

653
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
and trying to zoom out

654
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
to look at how

655
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
the whole of society might

656
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
or might not shift

657
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
do you think we're screwed

658
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
do you think are we

659
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
going to have millions of people engaging

660
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
in this kind of purposeful activity and therefore

661
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
changing the

662
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
direction of the meaning crisis

663
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
or do you think we are headed in a

664
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
direction that only gets worse

665
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I think we're screwed as long as people keep

666
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
looking in the wrong place

667
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
and that place

668
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
is this realm of the propositional

669
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
that's why I think John and I

670
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
get on so well in our podcast that we did together

671
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
as well because this is something we can

672
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
completely agree on that

673
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
obviously sorry to

674
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
disappoint you I can't tell you how to find

675
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
meaning that's not something that I'm

676
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
going to be able to do in 6 minutes and 53 seconds

677
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
and I don't think anybody seriously thinks

678
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
that I'm going to be able to do that

679
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
but you're still here listening we just want to

680
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
talk about what meaning is so I can't tell you

681
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
where it is found but I can

682
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
tell you where it's not and it's not found

683
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
at the bottom of a microscope

684
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
it's not found in these

685
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
syllogisms people don't

686
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
anything that brings people meaning

687
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
being talked into it all being

688
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
talked out of it never happens

689
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
rarely happens

690
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
because of syllogistic

691
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
argumentation it's something else

692
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I was reading Leo Tolstoy's

693
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Confession it's a wonderful

694
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
it's brilliant it's only like 100 pages

695
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
and he talks about how he was

696
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
he knew somebody who'd been on a camp

697
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
with his brother or something

698
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
and it stunned me as well because it was so long

699
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
ago it reads as if they're talking about the modern

700
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
world and its abandonment of religion due to

701
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
technology and all of this kind of stuff

702
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
but this is Tolstoy and he says that this friend

703
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
he's up with his brother

704
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
and they're in a tent and at the end of the night

705
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
he sort of bows down to pray do his nightly

706
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
prayers like they were trained to do his children

707
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
and his brother says

708
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
do you still do that

709
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
and that question alone

710
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
that just that was enough

711
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
such that that man never got down on his knees

712
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
and prayed ever again

713
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
there's no argument there's something

714
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
that isn't syllogized

715
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
that's sort of brought about by that kind of attitude

716
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
that completely changed his mind

717
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
and Tolstoy himself concluded that

718
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
while looking for questions of meaning he realized

719
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
that the more precise the answer

720
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
the less interesting the answer was

721
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
and the closer it was

722
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
to answering the question that he was interested in

723
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
the more vague it necessarily became

724
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
you know I can tell you

725
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
in principle exactly how many

726
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
molecules are in that jug of water over there

727
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
but who cares

728
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
it doesn't mean anything

729
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
and I think we're sort of stuck

730
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
the reason that we are sort of perpetually screwed

731
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
is because of that sort of

732
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
that

733
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
discorrelation that anti-correlation

734
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
that the more specific the answer becomes

735
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
the less

736
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
interesting a question is answering

737
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
with relation to meaning wherever meaning is

738
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
in other words it has to sort of lie

739
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
within the gaps there

740
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
and that's an old story

741
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
that's nothing new

742
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Is that pessimistic or optimistic

743
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I'm trying to work it out

744
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
what is the answer to while we screwed

745
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I mean do you think

746
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
we're putting all that together

747
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
we have a secular society

748
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
the numbers for religious faith

749
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
are continuing to plummet

750
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
do you think there are mechanisms

751
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
narratives

752
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
poems

753
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
structures

754
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
that will help rebuild

755
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
something out of this

756
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
because look I'm speaking very

757
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
the people who have said

758
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
that I'm on some kind of C.S. Lewis conversion

759
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
story might get excited by the things I'm saying

760
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
don't be fooled

761
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
the reason I talk about religion so much

762
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
is just because it's the best example

763
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
of a narrative of a story

764
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
but the thing that's providing

765
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
the meaning

766
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
the thing that I think is causing people

767
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
to not be despairing

768
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
if they're really sort of

769
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
head first into this religious stuff

770
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
it's not because of the religion

771
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
the thing that makes religion different

772
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
from any other form of narrative is its propositional content

773
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
the belief in a God

774
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
the belief in a specific set of ethical codes

775
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I've already said that that I don't think is the important thing

776
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
the important thing is the narrative

777
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
the reason the United States did so well for a time

778
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
in this foundational nation myth

779
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
the meaning

780
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
in an American's life

781
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
after the Revolutionary War

782
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
was not found in the fact that

783
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Washington swears in on a Bible

784
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
but because the man who's swearing in is himself

785
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
something of a mythical figure

786
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
but it seems to have lost confidence in that myth

787
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
and so you point to

788
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
the crisis of secularism

789
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
in modern America

790
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
is it secularism or is it just a loss of narrative

791
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
if we'd have gotten rid of the God stuff

792
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
this real attachment

793
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
people often quote or used to quote

794
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
the founding fathers of this nation

795
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
as if they were quoting Hadiths of the Prophet Muhammad

796
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
an argument was

797
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
settled in politics

798
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
by figuring out what the founding fathers thought

799
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
can you imagine that today

800
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
in a debate today someone says

801
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Thomas Jefferson thought there should be

802
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
a separation between churches

803
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
who cares what Thomas Jefferson thought

804
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
these were sort of crazy

805
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
white old men and that's how people see it now

806
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
so the thing that's lost is not necessarily religion

807
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
it's this American narrative

808
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
it's the narrative that's important now I think

809
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
John do you think

810
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
we're coming to the conclusion of this

811
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
half hour

812
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
do you think there are narratives

813
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
that are on the up

814
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
do you think there is cause

815
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
to feel like this is not just a

816
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
downward trajectory

817
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
I think there's increasing sign

818
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
for

819
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
what I call the advent of the sacred

820
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
people who

821
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I'm in conversation with them

822
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
and I both study them scientifically and participate

823
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
with them there's all these emerging

824
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
communities of practices all these

825
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
new ways in which people

826
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
are trying to

827
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
get at

828
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
a home for their desire to connect

829
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
and to transcend

830
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
sort of the prison of their egocentric

831
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
way of life

832
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
and they

833
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
are generally

834
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
open to the fact that they think

835
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
the traditional way of talking

836
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
isn't working for them

837
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
the fastest demographic group

838
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
fastest growing demographic group are the nuns

839
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
the NONES's

840
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
they'll overtake Christianity

841
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
in the United States probably in the next

842
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
two decades or so

843
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
something like that or maybe a little bit longer

844
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
and these people are not

845
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
by and large

846
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
sort of

847
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
just dyed in the wool analytic atheists

848
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
they're very much

849
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
you know people like Alex

850
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
people who are

851
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I think appropriately called seeking

852
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
they're seeking in some way they're open

853
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
they're trying to

854
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
consider new ways of thinking about this

855
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
and

856
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I think that is predicting that there is going to be

857
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
a fundamental

858
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
change I mean barring

859
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
that we don't destroy the world and other things along the way

860
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
because any attempt to

861
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
and this would be my critique of all ideological

862
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
political endeavors

863
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
any attempt to top down this into existence

864
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
is going to fail this has got to

865
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
bottom up it's got to come up

866
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
like I said out of that non propositional

867
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
out of people doing new practices

868
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
forming new kinds of communities

869
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
then the narratives

870
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
will be born they'll be born out of that

871
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
they can't just be made and imposed

872
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
on people or sold to people

873
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
that won't take that won't work

874
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
ladies and gentlemen

875
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
thank you so much to

876
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
both of our panelists

877
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
on this conversation
