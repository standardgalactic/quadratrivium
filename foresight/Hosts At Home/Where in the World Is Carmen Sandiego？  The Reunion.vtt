00:00.000 --> 00:28.800
All these people want to know where in the world is Carmen San Diego?

00:28.800 --> 00:35.200
Hello again, Gumshoots. I'm Adam Wurzel. Welcome to a very special edition of Hosts at Home.

00:35.200 --> 00:41.320
Now, we knew for our upcoming second season that we wanted to interview Greg Lee, the host of several of your favorite shows.

00:41.320 --> 00:52.840
But today is truly special because for the first time since 1995, we are reuniting the cast of the hit PBS game show where in the world is Carmen San Diego.

00:52.840 --> 01:04.000
That's right. With us, Acme, senior agent in charge of training new recruits, Greg Lee, also the gentleman, of course, the gentleman who performed as the house band on the show.

01:04.000 --> 01:12.200
They're all here too, Sean Altman, Scott Leonard, Elliot Kerman, Barry Carl, and Jeff Thatcher, better known as Rockapella.

01:12.200 --> 01:18.000
Of course, the Rockapella incarnation of the early to mid-90s. Gentlemen, great to see all of you.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Great to see you.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
You too.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Great to see you, Adam.

01:21.160 --> 01:27.000
So, we always start each episode of Hosts at Home by asking, where is home for you? Greg, we'll start with you.

01:27.000 --> 01:32.000
These days, it's in Santa Monica, California. Sean?

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
I live in Manhattan with my wife and my daughter.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
How about you, Scott?

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
I live in New York City, but I've escaped to Florida at the moment.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
How about you, Jeff?

01:44.000 --> 01:49.000
I live in Denver for two years now, but I used to live in New York City. I'm probably coming back.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Ooh!

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
East, east, east.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
How about you, Barry?

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
I'm about 20 miles north of Manhattan in farm country.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
Oh, Elliot?

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
I'm also in Manhattan, still.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
Can I just say, Elliot, I love the hat. The hat is fantastic.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
Thank you. It was a, it was a Carmen throwback.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
Oh, very good.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
Greg, let's start with you.

02:19.000 --> 02:25.000
You were working at a very iconic place for other kids' game shows when you got the job on Carmen.

02:25.000 --> 02:30.000
Tell everybody about that and how you transitioned into this role as host of Carmen San Diego.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
Well, I, you know, I did a lot of stuff for Nickelodeon.

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
I started off as an audience warm-up guy for a lot of their stuff.

02:37.000 --> 02:41.000
There was an old, old show called on CBS Saturday morning.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
That's how long ago this was.

02:43.000 --> 02:48.000
It was called Dr. Fad, which is about kids and inventions, I guess it was.

02:48.000 --> 02:53.000
So I was doing a lot of audience warm-up and then some announcing stuff.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
And then it was just a regular, you know, audition for, for Carmen.

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000
And I'd been down in Florida doing some more Nickelodeon stuff down there for, for a total panic.

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
And then came back to New York and then we just had the audition with Carmen.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
So we started there.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
How involved were you in the development of the show?

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
Not much. They already had it pretty much going when I got there, you know.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
I was trying not to screw it up too bad.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
I remember my stuff.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
Say the big words.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
Elliot, Elliot, let's go over to you now.

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
Can you tell us a little bit more about the group's audition process for the show?

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
God, I don't know if I even remember that.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
I think I can't remember what happened.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
I think they, does anybody remember actually?

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
I do remember.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
I remember at least how we got the audition.

03:44.000 --> 03:54.000
So we had just Spike Lee and company do it acapella had aired and that was our first national prominence.

03:54.000 --> 04:04.000
And sometime after that aired, I remember being in my closet in my, on East 10th Street in my apartment and the phone rang.

04:04.000 --> 04:09.000
And it was way pre cell phone and I answered it and he said, my name is Dana Calderwood.

04:09.000 --> 04:20.000
And I'm directing a show in development about that's based on a, on a, on a popular kids computer game.

04:20.000 --> 04:28.000
And we saw you guys on Spike Lee and would you be interested in auditioning for the role of the house pan that I remember.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
After that, I don't remember much at all.

04:31.000 --> 04:37.000
Let's talk to you, Scott, because Scott, you joined rock a pella in 1991.

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
The same year as we're in the world is Carmen saying San Diego premiere.

04:41.000 --> 04:48.000
Can you kind of just go in depth a little bit about how crazy life was for you in 1991.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
It was crazy.

04:49.000 --> 04:56.000
I just got back from work in Japan and wanted to move to New York.

04:56.000 --> 05:03.000
And there was something in the backstage publication about various things, but one of the things is rock a pella.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
It sounded like a good fit.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
So I went out and sang with them and we decided to do it.

05:08.000 --> 05:18.000
And then my first then to actually move up to New York, I think the, I moved up the first, the day before we had a meeting with the producers of Carmen San Diego.

05:18.000 --> 05:25.000
So as soon as I got there, we started doing that and then a bunch of stuff hit.

05:25.000 --> 05:34.000
Like we did a Whoopi Goldberg HBO special and Taco Bell commercial for the MTV movie awards.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
And then we then Billy Joel.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
And it's all been downhill for 30 years.

05:48.000 --> 05:56.000
I thought it was really going to be great hoping to get back there.

05:56.000 --> 06:03.000
Sean, let's, let's chat with you because we can't move forward without talking about this iconic theme song.

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
How did you get the idea for the theme song of the show?

06:08.000 --> 06:19.000
I wish there was a, I had an erudite explanation, but I really think it was a weird beginner's luck because I wasn't a, now I consider myself a songwriter.

06:19.000 --> 06:26.000
But when I wrote that, I think I considered myself someone who had an ear for something catchy.

06:26.000 --> 06:39.000
But I think I kind of got lucky and it was, you know, they, they told us they wanted music and, and I had this idea for the, for the thing.

06:39.000 --> 06:52.000
Somewhere around a microcosette, I have like the recording of me calling it, calling into my answering machine because that was before there was smartphones where you could record an idea.

06:52.000 --> 07:01.000
And, you know, the, the most seasoned songwriter I knew was my old high school friend, David Yasbeck.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
And I said, I've got, I've got three ideas.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
What is any of these any good?

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
And he said, this one is the good one.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
And I said, would you, would you help me flesh it out?

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
And he did.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
And, and we did a demo and the group liked it.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
And next thing you know, it was on TV.

07:18.000 --> 07:25.000
And we never had any concept that it would be featured in the way that it was.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
That was really unusual.

07:27.000 --> 07:39.000
And I think that's pretty much explains why the song has a lasting impact is that we were on camera singing it or lip syncing it every day.

07:39.000 --> 07:45.000
But, you know, what kind of, what theme song gets that kind of placement anymore.

07:45.000 --> 07:50.000
So that was, it was a weird confluence of happy accidents and luck.

07:58.000 --> 08:03.000
Rockapella was featured prominently throughout all five seasons of where in the world is Carmencindiego.

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
Barry, you guys did these song clues throughout the show.

08:07.000 --> 08:15.000
A lot of times these clues were arrangements that Rockapella had already done live with new lyrics.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
How quickly did you have to learn all of this material?

08:18.000 --> 08:33.000
The group was just, it was kind of mind blowing to sit in a dressing room and without a keyboard or anything throw together arrangements of songs and then go on the set and record them.

08:34.000 --> 08:46.000
I felt like I was working with a bunch of like most art level geniuses because we figured out parts and jammed, you know, they'd write these lyrics and we jam them into songs.

08:46.000 --> 08:55.000
And we were kind of used to doing that anyway with industrial shows, you know, taking songs from our repertoire and putting somebody else's lyrics to them.

08:55.000 --> 09:05.000
But now when I look back and I watch one of those clues, I go, damn, that was tight.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
For our next clue, here's Rockapella.

09:23.000 --> 09:30.000
Fifteen minutes ago we put this together and went out and did it. It was just, it was an amazing process.

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
Does anybody remember, did we even use cue cards? Because I don't recall.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
Sometimes.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Okay.

09:37.000 --> 09:42.000
But also what was crazy was that I think in the first three seasons we did them live.

09:42.000 --> 09:48.000
It wasn't until the latter, maybe the fourth and the fifth season that they started taping our clues.

09:48.000 --> 09:57.000
So we would literally have to put together an arrangement, do the arrangement, learn the thing and then go out and sing it live during the show.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
Look at me, something's going on out here, let's find out what it is.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
Hey guys, what's up?

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
Calypso, one, two, three, four.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
That's too bad.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
Trich tebellise.

10:12.000 --> 10:18.000
It was a zombie jamboree, took place in an island cemetery.

10:18.000 --> 10:27.000
It was a zombie jamboree on an island in the Caribbean Sea, just south of the Woodward Islands.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
You can hear some great Calypso bands.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
Zombies love the season of Garneval.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
They get together and back on out.

10:36.000 --> 10:41.000
First year, they would do the whole show straight through.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
They started splitting it up.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
They would do all the end games, right?

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
That first was like a radio show, it was crazy.

10:49.000 --> 10:53.000
It was horrible.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
We were there very late at night too.

10:56.000 --> 11:00.000
Very early, very early.

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
I didn't see spring for five years.

11:04.000 --> 11:11.000
You guys may not have known, remember the first several shows, they kept changing the rules?

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
Were you aware of that?

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
They continued to change as we were going.

11:15.000 --> 11:20.000
The scoring system on today's Carmen San Diego is different, but the game is the same.

11:20.000 --> 11:24.000
That's not happening, now we're going to do this, and it was just so horrible.

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
You were really good though by the seat of your pants.

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
I think I was just dazed, it's very kind of that.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
Boy, you look cool.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
It's the coat baby, it's the coat.

11:37.000 --> 11:42.000
And this is special agent in charge of training new recruits, Reg Lee!

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
Reg Lee!

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Reg Lee!

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
Reg Lee!

11:49.000 --> 11:56.000
Seriously, that first year was a lot of reinventing the wheel as we were going.

11:56.000 --> 12:01.000
And I still have some parents who were mad at me from the first season.

12:01.000 --> 12:08.000
Because if you guys remember, as Scott said, we would do the whole thing, or Elliot said,

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
we would do the whole thing all the way through.

12:10.000 --> 12:14.000
So you would do all the business with you guys and the songs, you were doing those live,

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
and I would go to Lin's office and she'd be sitting back there, we'd do our bit, we'd come back out, we'd keep rolling.

12:18.000 --> 12:22.000
We'd go right into the middle part, into the big map part.

12:22.000 --> 12:30.000
And the rules of the big map for the first season, at least for most of it was, I had to give three clues for each country.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
So while the kids staying in there was the same.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
Let me tell you a little bit about this particular country.

12:36.000 --> 12:40.000
In the iron ore, and it's a very temporary area.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
Just tell me the name of the country, man!

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
On your mark, get set, go!

12:45.000 --> 12:51.000
Side of landmark civil rights protest, it's capitalist Montgomery, Carmen went to Alabama.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
Alright, sorry, try it again.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
That's it, okay!

12:56.000 --> 13:01.000
Come on, let's go! The nation's leading dairy producer, it's capitalist Madison, Carmen went to Wisconsin.

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
Rattling off all this information, carrots are mad, I can see him up to the side.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
They're screaming, why is he reading so slow?

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
That got changed relatively early.

13:11.000 --> 13:16.000
I don't remember any pilots, but I do remember just, as they said, a lot of the beginning time,

13:16.000 --> 13:20.000
just kind of making it up and staying very late and getting up very early.

13:20.000 --> 13:27.000
But it was a, I gotta tell you man, it was still some of the best friends I've ever had working ever.

13:27.000 --> 13:31.000
Met my wife on that show, and it was just one of the greatest experiences.

13:31.000 --> 13:35.000
Because I think it was more than, you know, it was more than just a game show.

13:35.000 --> 13:40.000
I think it was a lot going on there, and I wish they still had something like it,

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
because you know, I think one of the things we always said about that show was,

13:43.000 --> 13:49.000
people would always ask, you know, do you really think you could teach kids about geography in such a short period of time?

13:49.000 --> 13:55.000
We would always say, well no, but we can't get them excited about it and interested in it.

13:55.000 --> 14:03.000
Because it's not just about the places on the map, you know, you got people there and cultures and food and religion and all these wonderful traditions.

14:03.000 --> 14:09.000
And as we've seen the world get so much smaller, you know, it seems so much more important to be aware of that.

14:09.000 --> 14:14.000
And I kind of, I'm sorry that they still don't have something like that.

14:14.000 --> 14:18.000
They can do that for kids and for us too.

14:18.000 --> 14:23.000
Greg, when did you, at some point I know you started writing for the show.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
Yeah.

14:24.000 --> 14:29.000
And I was, I remember being really happy because I felt like you were, you know,

14:29.000 --> 14:35.000
I always felt like I was completely in the dark about anything having to do with the inner workings of the show.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
You know, I felt like I did what I was told.

14:38.000 --> 14:46.000
But at some point you started writing, and that must have been very sort of freeing and creatively exciting for you.

14:46.000 --> 14:54.000
Yeah, it really was, it really was fun, you know, because working with you guys and of course with Lynn was just such a, I always felt very,

14:54.000 --> 15:00.000
because like I said, I'd basically come from audience warm up and out, so it was still kind of new to me to even do any of this kind of stuff.

15:00.000 --> 15:05.000
And I always felt like I was, you know, learning so much from you guys and from Lynn too.

15:05.000 --> 15:10.000
And remember when it dawned on me that she was hilarious.

15:10.000 --> 15:14.000
Like, I don't know that they really realized how hilarious she is.

15:14.000 --> 15:18.000
And that's if I could just take a few shots at starting to write some stuff.

15:18.000 --> 15:22.000
You know, I started with those, what we call Jilos, the Greg and Lynn's office, you know.

15:22.000 --> 15:29.000
And I said, I remember saying, for a while, my character kept taking all the hits.

15:29.000 --> 15:33.000
And I kept saying, I think my character is the kid and she's like the parrot.

15:33.000 --> 15:37.000
And I'm telling you, she can't hit herself in the face with a boxing glove and fall back.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
And it will be funny because she's hilarious.

15:40.000 --> 15:47.000
And remember that just for a lot of the writers, it seemed like it opened a lot of possibilities because she was so great.

15:47.000 --> 15:53.000
And you guys were always so up for anything and, you know, and for whatever could happen.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
It just opened so many things that we get so fun.

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
So I wasn't just the guy having to read those cards.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
Did you write the Floyd the Barber stuff?

16:02.000 --> 16:07.000
Yeah, Floyd the Barber.

16:07.000 --> 16:11.000
Which is basically my brother preacher character, which is basically the mayor from Doug.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
It's all the same.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
No, no, nonsense.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
That burning sensation is normal.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
Well, it's the puffiness that has me concerned.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
Be back with you just a little bit.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
Hi, Craig.

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
Of course, there is one cast member, as Greg said, that is no longer with us.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
Jeff, tell us about your memories of Lynn Thigbin.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
You know, Lynn, you know, she's a total professional.

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
I've come to learn over the years how much she was respected.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
Every show, she did a lot of shows.

16:38.000 --> 16:42.000
Not just PBS goofy stuff, but really serious drama stuff.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
And there's just so much respect for her.

16:44.000 --> 16:48.000
And I'm sorry to not have her here.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
For our next clue.

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
She was a great singer.

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
So we got to sing what she did, the number with a few numbers with us.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
And when she would sing and tear it up, it was really something.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
She won a Tony Award.

17:17.000 --> 17:22.000
And she was the, she played the stage manager in the movie Tootsie.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
Oh my God.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
She's kind of, you know, she's an icon.

17:26.000 --> 17:30.000
And such a nice, they're nice to us.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
Just always really warm to us.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
She was lovely.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
A lovely, and she was very generous.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
She's a very lovely, generous person.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
She was a joy spreader.

17:39.000 --> 17:46.000
And I thought she just kind of up leveled the whole production.

17:46.000 --> 17:50.000
She was probably the one real pro amongst us.

17:50.000 --> 17:54.000
No offense, Greg.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
I totally agree.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
I was the act that was the way.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
Yeah.

17:58.000 --> 18:02.000
This is Lynn Fitzpinn speaking for where in the world is Carmen Sandiego.

18:02.000 --> 18:06.000
And remember, criminals are mean and greedy.

18:06.000 --> 18:10.000
But act me good like Steve and Edie.

18:10.000 --> 18:17.000
They hired us to do the next generation of Rockapella to do the where in the world is Carmen Sandiego planetarium show.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
You remember that, Scott?

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
And we, it was like surround sound.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
It was supposed to be on a dome and a planetarium.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
It was after this show it ended.

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
And I was so relieved to see that she was part of that.

18:28.000 --> 18:33.000
Because we felt, to me it seemed like a little bit adrift without her.

18:33.000 --> 18:37.000
And there she was, comfortingly talking about planets and stars.

18:37.000 --> 18:56.000
None of you guys have a Tony award like Lynn did.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
But there was a lot of acting on this show.

18:59.000 --> 19:05.000
From the outside looking in, it kind of felt like Scott and Barry that you guys were doing most of the acting.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
Barry, we'll start with you. Did you come from an acting background?

19:08.000 --> 19:17.000
I did, but let's make a distinction here between acting like Lynn did and shtick like we did.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
Well, I take offense at that.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
What do you imply?

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
The fine art of shtick.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
I'm sorry, Scott.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
Before me, it wasn't, that's fine.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
Okay, I was deeply committed.

19:31.000 --> 19:37.000
Stanislavski method, really getting in there, really penetrating the character.

19:37.000 --> 19:42.000
You know, I had a long, passionate relationship with Mrs. Pumpkin-Clanger.

19:42.000 --> 19:51.000
The stench of crime lies heavy upon us, like a patient etherized upon a table.

19:51.000 --> 20:00.000
And alas, my downstairs neighbors are the clumsy surgeon entrusted with its cure.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

20:03.000 --> 20:07.000
Can you still do the voice, Barry? Can you still do the Mrs. Pumpkin-Clanger voice?

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
Griggy!

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
No, I guess not.

20:12.000 --> 20:22.000
You know, the most interesting thing about that character was coming out of hair and makeup in my house dress and full drag,

20:22.000 --> 20:30.000
I had a bra and each cup was stuffed with two pairs of like thick athletic socks.

20:30.000 --> 20:36.000
And even though the camera crew, everybody knew me, you know, it's like, it was me.

20:36.000 --> 20:42.000
But there I was in, you know, a wig and makeup with these huge tits.

20:42.000 --> 20:47.000
And the poor guys in the camera crew, they couldn't help looking at them.

20:47.000 --> 20:54.000
And I was like, guys, guys, it sucks. It's me, it sucks.

20:54.000 --> 20:58.000
You're not looking at what you think you're looking at, but I know you can't help it.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
It's really funny.

21:01.000 --> 21:07.000
Scott, the Emmy for Best Dying Informant goes to you.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
I think we have a serious problem on our hands.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
Do you ever lose your voice from all that screaming?

21:23.000 --> 21:29.000
I basically scream for a living. I mean, if you've listened to the parts of rock and pellets.

21:30.000 --> 21:34.000
Yeah, I don't think I've ever, well, I've lost my voice funny. Yeah, sure.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
But not from the dying informant.

21:54.000 --> 21:58.000
With me, it wasn't really shtick. It was shtick because I was such a wooden actor.

21:59.000 --> 22:06.000
But we did. But it was, I guess, everybody's dream to put on an Elvis outfit and do Elvis.

22:06.000 --> 22:11.000
So that was actually really, really fun. That was one of my favorite moments of the whole show.

22:11.000 --> 22:23.000
That and consistently, actually, the middle game was absolutely phenomenally crazy on the edge of a cliff fun.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
Aruba's fruit market.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
No.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
Aruba's fruit market.

22:29.000 --> 22:32.000
I tensioned fruit market shoppers. Still no.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
Stampede.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
That sounded like a real stampede.

22:45.000 --> 22:54.000
Trying to get the warrant and the loot and like trying to crack Greg up and like that whole thing was just crazy live TV.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
Your turn.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
Gillette tassel.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
Gillette tassel.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
Ow!

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
Cut myself shaving, Greg.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
Get it?

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
Why did you do that?

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
Oh, I don't know.

23:10.000 --> 23:21.000
By the end, they would make us show them the list we had made of the terms for the loot because they got a little blue or a little bit too pushy, too edgy for PBS.

23:21.000 --> 23:25.000
So we would have to have Howard, the producer, come and look at our list say, okay, okay.

23:25.000 --> 23:30.000
My favorite was when they had that statue in Belgium of a little guy that's urinating.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
Market piss.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
Market piss.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
And we said, little us, we, we.

23:34.000 --> 23:38.000
And there was also like, European.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
They vetoed that one.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
They vetoed European?

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Yeah, I was so disappointed.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
I thought, European, okay.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
It was like, no.

23:49.000 --> 23:53.000
That would be totally allowed nowadays.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
Bring on more pee.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
We had the list of where everything was.

23:57.000 --> 24:03.000
And when they were, when they said something, we would all go into this, like a sprinter's crouch.

24:03.000 --> 24:08.000
You know, and we were, you, you would hear the breathing of the guy next to you to know when to come in.

24:08.000 --> 24:12.000
It was, it was, it was athletic and very exciting.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
The warrants.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
The loot and the warrant.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
Do you remember where Sarah is?

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
The dinosaur's state park.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
Is she still at the dinosaur's state park?

24:33.000 --> 24:38.000
That was like one of the most creative parts of the show is that we would actually get to write like five or six of them.

24:38.000 --> 24:42.000
And we were so, so frustrating when the kid would get it quickly.

24:42.000 --> 24:46.000
We didn't get to use this brilliant comedy, right?

24:46.000 --> 24:49.000
I think, I think we came up, I don't think we started with the loot.

24:49.000 --> 24:53.000
I think the loot came after they started censoring us.

24:53.000 --> 25:02.000
And so when they censored us like with European and look at what those ones, then we would just be pissed and say, the loot.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
Yes.

25:08.000 --> 25:12.000
Jeff, when you, when you joined this group, I mean, what were your first thoughts?

25:12.000 --> 25:16.000
Cause I mean, these are some, some wild and zany people.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
Yeah.

25:17.000 --> 25:21.000
I had seen them on the Spike Lee special that they got Carmen from.

25:21.000 --> 25:29.000
And for my audition, I had to interpret the sequence drum sounds from the soundtrack album to Carmen San Diego.

25:29.000 --> 25:33.000
That was one of the things that Sean had me do in my hotel room audition.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
So when I got there, it was, you know, it was a well oiled machine.

25:36.000 --> 25:44.000
It was already in Queens in Kauffman Astoria Studios and Elliott would pick me up in his car service in the Upper West side of New York.

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
And we would, off we would go to this crazy thing that I'd never seen before.

25:47.000 --> 25:58.000
I'd worked in production staff for TV for a couple of years, but I had not been a part of something this colorful and seemingly freewheeling, I guess you could say.

25:58.000 --> 26:06.000
And, and I, you know, that something that these guys have kind of alluded to, there was definitely a little bit of a rebellious vibe.

26:06.000 --> 26:10.000
There was a creative versus structure kind of thing going on.

26:10.000 --> 26:17.000
That was really interesting to watch because that kind of sense of rebellion is kind of what Rockefeller is in many ways in my interpretation.

26:17.000 --> 26:20.000
I've seen that a lot and it's, and it's something that is hilarious.

26:20.000 --> 26:24.000
What's going to happen is Greg's going to come out and Scott's pants are down.

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
And Greg's going to cry.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
The right one.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
Yes!

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
Go Dino, go, go, uh, word.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
Let's see if I can look from there.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
Oh, there you go.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
Well, I have to use that one. I'm locking it.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
That's a good one. You can use that?

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
Yeah, I'm supposed to do it.

26:49.000 --> 26:52.000
There's a fine shit of, what do you call those things again?

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
Fiber optic sparklers.

26:55.000 --> 27:02.000
I knew how a TV show was made, but I had not seen that level of creativity in action like moment to moment.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
It was really interesting.

27:03.000 --> 27:06.000
There was a lot of moving parts to this show.

27:06.000 --> 27:10.000
Greg, what was the most challenging part of your job?

27:11.000 --> 27:15.000
Well, I mean, I make jokes about it, but I really did.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
It was hard for me to read those cards.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
I mean, some of those names are very hard for me.

27:19.000 --> 27:23.000
I'm a fairly dyslexic person, and I mean, seriously dyslexic.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
And so some of those were like, you got me kidding me, man.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
I couldn't even pronounce them. I read them.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Okay, guys, name the city, if you will, please.

27:30.000 --> 27:34.000
Is it Bratislava, Gdansk, or Odessa?

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
Remember the clues that we heard on the Danube River?

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
The answer we're looking for is Panampen.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
Nice job, guys.

27:39.000 --> 27:42.000
Kunming, Hong Kong, or Taipei?

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
Remember the clues that we heard.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
Thanks a lot.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
If there was ever any pressure about it,

27:46.000 --> 27:49.000
that for me was always the hardest part,

27:49.000 --> 27:53.000
to just be rolling and then have a Herzegovina sitting there.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
I have no idea what that's like.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
What in the world is that?

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
So that was always the hardest part for me.

27:59.000 --> 28:02.000
The rest of it was fairly, you know, when you could move and do things,

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
it was fairly just enjoyable.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
It was just fun, you know.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
And of course, the map was the most fun,

28:09.000 --> 28:13.000
just because that's the time that I felt like I was the kid's teammate.

28:13.000 --> 28:16.000
So you just really wanted me to get there.

28:16.000 --> 28:20.000
Do you think your geography skills got better through the years?

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
Possibly.

28:21.000 --> 28:25.000
I mean, they were okay before, I guess.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
I remember the, I don't know if you guys remember this,

28:27.000 --> 28:31.000
but I think it was at the very first show.

28:31.000 --> 28:35.000
It was early on, I remember that the Soviet Union broke up

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
right before we went to Tape one night.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
Do you guys remember this?

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
Yes.

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
They changed all the maps like the night before.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
The lyrics.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
Check in Slovakia.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
Yeah.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
So everything had changed like the night before.

28:49.000 --> 28:54.000
So they'd been up all night changing the big map that we're going to use that day.

28:54.000 --> 28:59.000
That story has an ending somewhere, but I don't have it right now.

28:59.000 --> 29:03.000
Can we, while I have everybody here,

29:03.000 --> 29:06.000
and I want to kind of set the record straight,

29:06.000 --> 29:09.000
because Barry before we went on told me a story, Greg,

29:09.000 --> 29:13.000
about this unique accident that happened on set between the two of you.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
Do you remember that, Greg?

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
Who was it?

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
What was the, who was it?

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
Between you and Barry, an accident happened.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
To me, Barry?

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
Barry knows it.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
Barry, you know it?

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
It sounds like an unplanned pregnancy.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
The 10 ton weight?

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
10 ton weight?

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
No, no.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
No, but as you remember,

29:34.000 --> 29:39.000
actually we were rehearsing one of the big baby scenes.

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
Yeah.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
And I was making a lot of noise.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
I was probably crying.

29:44.000 --> 29:50.000
And you silenced me by shoving a big binky in my mouth.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Yeah.

29:52.000 --> 29:55.000
I don't know what got into you that day,

29:55.000 --> 29:59.000
but it just slugged me in the mouth.

29:59.000 --> 30:02.000
I had this big, huge, fat lip.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Oh my gosh.

30:04.000 --> 30:08.000
I was like, I have no memory of that.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
Well, my mouth remembers.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
I'm so sorry.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
Wow, that must be...

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
Well, Greg, you apologized at the time.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
There was no hard feelings.

30:17.000 --> 30:21.000
I just remember that enormous binky, you know, slamming into my mouth.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
It's been years of therapy.

30:23.000 --> 30:26.000
You know, we're good.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
I do remember hitting the shower with a snowball

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
when we had that big run around.

30:30.000 --> 30:33.000
Yeah, that's one of the ones that's on YouTube.

30:33.000 --> 30:36.000
Now, we have just heard that Nimoy has left Conakry.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
So let's pick up the chase.

30:38.000 --> 30:41.000
The chase.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
Quite enough of this, mister.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
It's on you right now.

30:55.000 --> 30:58.000
No, no, no.

30:59.000 --> 31:02.000
No, no, no, no.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
Thank you.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
My daughter loves that one, but it was good.

31:08.000 --> 31:12.000
And when I watched that, my main impression is,

31:12.000 --> 31:15.000
wow, I could run.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
Because now it gets better.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
But that was good.

31:19.000 --> 31:22.000
And also, you know, I remember it's like,

31:22.000 --> 31:25.000
some of the stuff we did was, I wouldn't call it athletic,

31:26.000 --> 31:29.000
the four or the five of us crammed into the doorway

31:29.000 --> 31:32.000
to sing to Greg, sing some of those clues.

31:32.000 --> 31:35.000
I don't know how we did that because we were all,

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
three of us, two of us must have been on our knees

31:37.000 --> 31:40.000
and we were all just kind of squished in there.

31:56.000 --> 31:59.000
That pizza robot, yeah.

31:59.000 --> 32:02.000
Whoa, that pizza robot.

32:02.000 --> 32:06.000
Bring back, bring back that pizza robot

32:06.000 --> 32:10.000
because we're getting lonely for some pepperoni.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
We remember banks, banks, banks.

32:12.000 --> 32:15.000
We had this, where we had to sing the three of us.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
That was good.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
Four of us were like singing some background thing

32:19.000 --> 32:22.000
and our lyric was banks, banks, banks.

32:22.000 --> 32:25.000
And we, like before the skit, we said,

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
okay, on banks, banks, banks, we're all going to jump,

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
hop on each banks.

32:29.000 --> 32:33.000
And of course, so like, we all got together except for Sean

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
and said like, let's not do it.

32:35.000 --> 32:38.000
So Sean's is hopping banks, banks, banks, and we're not.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
Oh my God, it's great.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
Whoa.

32:42.000 --> 32:45.000
Banks, banks, banks, banks, banks, banks.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
Whoa.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
Hey, hey, I think we got the point.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.000
Thank you.

32:50.000 --> 32:53.000
I think we got the final taped episode of Carmen.

32:53.000 --> 32:57.000
Sean cut off, or Greg dressed as the barber.

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
You cut off Sean's iconic braids,

32:59.000 --> 33:02.000
but is it true that nobody else knew what was going to happen?

33:02.000 --> 33:06.000
Thank you for calling the braids iconic.

33:06.000 --> 33:14.000
I look back at them with the mixture of embarrassment and.

33:14.000 --> 33:18.000
That was the 90s spent a lot of money on this.

33:18.000 --> 33:21.000
I remember that the only people that knew was going to happen

33:21.000 --> 33:24.000
were Greg and I guess the director and one of the producers.

33:24.000 --> 33:29.000
I think maybe I was done with wearing an 80s haircut in the 90s.

33:29.000 --> 33:36.000
Ask, have I been swigging too much from the flask?

33:36.000 --> 33:39.000
Why cut my braids?

33:39.000 --> 33:47.000
You wonder, I've been Schmoderich and Stevie Blunder.

33:47.000 --> 33:50.000
It's been 10 years.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
Yes.

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
Count them.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
A 12 on Twitter.

33:54.000 --> 33:57.000
American dollars.

33:57.000 --> 34:01.000
I just found almost all of those braids.

34:01.000 --> 34:05.000
I'm going to try to sell them.

34:05.000 --> 34:09.000
Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?

34:09.000 --> 34:10.000
Tell me.

34:10.000 --> 34:13.000
Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
Tell me.

34:14.000 --> 34:18.000
Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?

34:18.000 --> 34:21.000
This has been for where in the world is Carmen Sandiego.

34:21.000 --> 34:24.000
And remember, the Acme Triangle of Excellence.

34:24.000 --> 34:28.000
Vigilance, dedication, courage.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?

34:30.000 --> 34:34.000
Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?

34:34.000 --> 34:39.000
Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?

34:39.000 --> 34:44.000
All geographic information was accurate as of the date this program was recorded.

34:44.000 --> 34:47.000
Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?

34:47.000 --> 34:50.000
Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?

34:50.000 --> 34:54.000
Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?

34:54.000 --> 34:57.000
Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
It's on the back.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
It's on the back, y'all.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
Look at that.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
That's what I call a buzz cut.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.000
Awesome.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
We're really cooking.

35:06.000 --> 35:11.000
Including all the hair gentlemen, I mean, I truly loved where in the world is Carmen Sandiego.

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
Every element.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
Greg, Rockefeller.

35:14.000 --> 35:18.000
So the big question is, why do you change a show?

35:18.000 --> 35:21.000
Why do you make a show where in time is Carmen Sandiego?

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
When the show was already such a huge hit.

35:23.000 --> 35:28.000
Tell me where in time is Carmen Sandiego?

35:29.000 --> 35:38.000
I remember somebody, somebody in power telling me it's easier to get funding for a new show

35:38.000 --> 35:42.000
than to get an existing show refunded.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.000
Wow.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
I don't know how that works.

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
It was disappointing.

35:46.000 --> 35:56.000
I mean, especially in retrospect, when you realize now how valuable to a career being on television is.

35:56.000 --> 36:03.000
At the time, maybe, I can't speak for everyone else, but at the time, you know, I remember thinking,

36:03.000 --> 36:09.000
oh, you know, we'll get on another TV show or some other amazing thing will happen.

36:09.000 --> 36:12.000
But, you know, these things don't happen very often.

36:12.000 --> 36:18.000
And to be on television every day is, wow, that's a powerful thing for a career.

36:18.000 --> 36:24.000
That sound means it is time for the lightning round, just like on Carmen Sandiego.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
You're on host home.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
We also have a round.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
Are you guys up for a challenge?

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
Yes, sir.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
Scott says reluctantly.

36:33.000 --> 36:34.000
Yes, sir.

36:34.000 --> 36:35.000
Here's what's going to happen.

36:35.000 --> 36:39.000
Let's see how well you know your Carmen Sandiego crooks.

36:39.000 --> 36:40.000
I'm going to go to each of you.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
I'm going to ask you to name a crook.

36:42.000 --> 36:46.000
We're going to keep going until we have one winner.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
Name any Carmen Sandiego crook.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
Jeff, we're going to start with you.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
It's a brute.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
Elias.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
Nick the slick.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
Barry.

37:01.000 --> 37:04.000
I lose.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
Greg.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
Eddie Larisony.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
Scott.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
Top Grunge.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
John.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
Ni ni ni ni ni ni moi.

37:16.000 --> 37:19.000
Ni ni ni ni ni moi.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
That was great, by the way.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
That was great.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
Back over to you, Jeff.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
Oh, God, what's left?

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
Those two guys, the twins.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.000
Double trouble.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
Yes, double trouble.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
Elias.

37:32.000 --> 37:35.000
That was the last one I could remember was double trouble.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
You have five left.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
Oh my God.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
Five left?

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
There's five left.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
Hint, hint, hint.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
I got a line.

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
Three seconds.

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
No idea.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
All right, there's Scott.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
There's four more left.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
I got nothing.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.000
All right.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
I'll give you guys a hint.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
Oh.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.000
Robo crook.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
Robo crook.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
And the Contessa.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
Contessa.

38:05.000 --> 38:08.000
And Nana rap, but people didn't realize that.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
She was very diverse.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
She was.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
She had suffered a lot.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
She's no good.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
Nana.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
You got the Nana.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
Nana.

38:21.000 --> 38:24.000
By the way, the two that nobody named just so we can put everybody

38:24.000 --> 38:27.000
out of their misery was Sarah Nade.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.000
Oh yeah.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
Sarah Nade.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
Okay, that was the rock one.

38:31.000 --> 38:32.000
Yeah.

38:32.000 --> 38:35.000
And then nobody, nobody names Carmen San Diego.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
Oh.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
Well, we want to talk about that.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
We want to talk about that.

38:40.000 --> 38:43.000
We want to talk about what everybody's doing now.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.000
Scott,

38:44.000 --> 38:47.000
you have been in rock appella coming up on 30 years and you're

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
still making great music with rock appella.

38:49.000 --> 38:52.000
But you hear that statistic that Scott Leonard has been with

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
rock appella for 30 years.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
Does it surprise you?

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
Yeah, it's kind of,

38:57.000 --> 38:58.000
I don't,

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
it doesn't really mean anything to me.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.000
I'm like,

39:01.000 --> 39:04.000
it may after day just get up and do it again and then it just

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
accumulates like that.

39:05.000 --> 39:06.000
I guess.

39:06.000 --> 39:07.000
Crazy.

39:07.000 --> 39:11.000
I can't believe it's been 30 years since we did Carmen San

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
Diego.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
I mean,

39:13.000 --> 39:14.000
that's another life.

39:14.000 --> 39:15.000
Yeah.

39:15.000 --> 39:16.000
And Jeff,

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
you're also still with rock appella.

39:18.000 --> 39:21.000
Can you tell us what the group is up to nowadays?

39:21.000 --> 39:22.000
Well,

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
we never stopped making stuff.

39:24.000 --> 39:28.000
And we've had a lot of albums and,

39:28.000 --> 39:29.000
you know,

39:29.000 --> 39:30.000
folders,

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
coffee commercials and all kinds of things like that.

39:32.000 --> 39:33.000
So, you know,

39:33.000 --> 39:36.000
if that sound is something that you enjoy,

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
please come and check us out.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.000
Elliot,

40:04.000 --> 40:07.000
you left rock appella in 2004 and I'm really jealous of you

40:07.000 --> 40:12.000
because you work on my wife and my absolute like favorite TV

40:12.000 --> 40:13.000
show,

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
besides Carmen,

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
of course,

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
can you tell us about that?

40:16.000 --> 40:17.000
Um,

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
I guess you're talking about the marvelous Mrs.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
Maisel.

40:20.000 --> 40:21.000
Yeah.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
But,

40:22.000 --> 40:23.000
um,

40:23.000 --> 40:24.000
so I work on my,

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
I built a business over the years.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.000
Consulting on,

40:27.000 --> 40:32.000
and submitting tax incentive applications for many,

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
many,

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
many TV shows and films in New York.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.000
Um,

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
so I work for big studios.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.000
Um,

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
and one of them is one of the,

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
one of my shows is the marvelous Mrs.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
Maisel.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.000
Wow.

40:45.000 --> 40:46.000
It's a fantastic show.

40:46.000 --> 40:47.000
How about you, Barry?

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
Oh,

40:48.000 --> 40:49.000
how about you?

40:49.000 --> 40:50.000
What are you up to?

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
Well,

40:51.000 --> 40:52.000
you know,

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
I left a great deal of work.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.000
Um,

40:55.000 --> 40:56.000
and my,

40:56.000 --> 41:00.000
my primary incentive was my kids were growing up without me.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
Um,

41:01.000 --> 41:05.000
so I spent a good amount of time kind of having a relationship with

41:05.000 --> 41:06.000
my kids,

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
which went by really fast, you know,

41:08.000 --> 41:11.000
because then college happened and out of the house.

41:11.000 --> 41:12.000
Um,

41:12.000 --> 41:16.000
I retrained as a, as a, um,

41:16.000 --> 41:17.000
therapist.

41:17.000 --> 41:18.000
And,

41:18.000 --> 41:19.000
um,

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
I've been doing that for,

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
gosh,

41:22.000 --> 41:23.000
15 years.

41:23.000 --> 41:24.000
Uh,

41:24.000 --> 41:25.000
but I,

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
I still get to do music and I have,

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
I,

41:28.000 --> 41:29.000
I've been doing voiceovers for

41:29.000 --> 41:32.000
since 1983.

41:32.000 --> 41:33.000
I think.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
Um,

41:34.000 --> 41:38.000
so I'm still basically doing everything that I was doing,

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
except singing with the guys and,

41:40.000 --> 41:41.000
and traveling.

41:41.000 --> 41:42.000
Um,

41:42.000 --> 41:45.000
so I'm still basically doing everything that I was doing,

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
singing with the guys and,

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
and traveling.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
And of course we have to mention this.

41:51.000 --> 41:52.000
How could we forget?

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
You were the announcer of the game show.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.000
You would have.

41:55.000 --> 41:56.000
I was.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
That's right.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.000
Oh,

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
these people want to know.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
They're in the world.

42:02.000 --> 42:13.000
It's

42:14.000 --> 42:15.000
a travel guide collection.

42:15.000 --> 42:16.000
Meet Adam Herbie.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
She's been to Spain and Columbia.

42:18.000 --> 42:19.000
He likes martial arts.

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
Meet Stephanie Donozo.

42:21.000 --> 42:22.000
We all wear a lot of hats.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.000
Literally.

42:23.000 --> 42:24.000
Literally.

42:24.000 --> 42:25.000
Like Elliot,

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
literally wear a lot of hats.

42:27.000 --> 42:28.000
Sean,

42:28.000 --> 42:29.000
you always wear a lot of hats.

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
And now you have this incredible duo,

42:31.000 --> 42:32.000
the Everly set.

42:32.000 --> 42:33.000
Wake up,

42:33.000 --> 42:34.000
little Susie.

42:34.000 --> 42:35.000
Wake up.

42:35.000 --> 42:39.000
Never felt like this until I kissed you.

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
Love hurts,

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
love scars.

42:44.000 --> 42:45.000
I'm in a,

42:45.000 --> 42:46.000
I'm in a

42:46.000 --> 42:49.000
Everly brothers tribute act.

42:49.000 --> 42:50.000
I've become one of the,

42:50.000 --> 42:51.000
you know,

42:51.000 --> 42:52.000
when I was,

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
when I was focused on writing original music,

42:54.000 --> 42:57.000
I used to laugh at tribute acts.

42:57.000 --> 42:58.000
And now I've become,

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
that's what I do now.

43:00.000 --> 43:01.000
And finally,

43:01.000 --> 43:04.000
because the show is called hosts at home,

43:04.000 --> 43:07.000
with the most Greg Lee,

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
in very sunny Santa Monica, California.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
What are you up to nowadays?

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
Mostly I just do a lot of voiceover like Barry.

43:13.000 --> 43:14.000
And,

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
and then we do a lot of writing.

43:16.000 --> 43:19.000
Pitch and I just did a show for Audible for

43:19.000 --> 43:20.000
Highlights magazine.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
We did a bunch of kit stuff for them.

43:22.000 --> 43:23.000
So we still do a lot of that stuff.

43:23.000 --> 43:24.000
Well guys,

43:24.000 --> 43:27.000
this has been truly phenomenal to reunite

43:27.000 --> 43:30.000
the cast of where in the world is Carmen San Diego.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
Did you guys have fun?

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
Yes, I did.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
Yes.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
Yes, I did.

43:38.000 --> 43:39.000
It's great.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
It's great to see you guys.

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
Very great to see you.

43:43.000 --> 43:44.000
It's key.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
You got to count it off, Sean.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
You got to give it a shot.

43:48.000 --> 43:49.000
Is that it?

43:49.000 --> 43:50.000
That's it.

43:50.000 --> 43:51.000
Wow.

43:51.000 --> 43:52.000
That's so high.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
Oh my God.

43:54.000 --> 43:55.000
Cut.

43:55.000 --> 43:56.000
Let's take it down.

43:56.000 --> 43:57.000
Let's take it,

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
let's take it down a whole step.

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
Hey, hey.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
Oh God.

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
I'm really going to try to do it.

44:05.000 --> 44:06.000
It'll never,

44:06.000 --> 44:07.000
it'll never sync up.

44:07.000 --> 44:08.000
Right.

44:08.000 --> 44:09.000
Warning.

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
What you're about to see is living proof

44:11.000 --> 44:14.000
that live music does not work over Zoom.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
One, two, three.

44:16.000 --> 44:17.000
Hoop.

44:17.000 --> 44:18.000
Hoop.

44:18.000 --> 44:19.000
Hoop.

44:19.000 --> 44:20.000
Hoop.

44:20.000 --> 44:21.000
Hoop.

44:21.000 --> 44:22.000
Hoop.

44:22.000 --> 44:23.000
Hoop.

44:23.000 --> 44:24.000
Hoop.

44:24.000 --> 44:25.000
Hoop.

44:25.000 --> 44:26.000
Hoop.

44:26.000 --> 44:27.000
Hoop.

44:27.000 --> 44:28.000
Hoop.

44:28.000 --> 44:29.000
Hoop.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.000
Hoop.

44:30.000 --> 44:31.000
Hoop.

44:31.000 --> 44:32.000
Hoop.

44:32.000 --> 44:33.000

44:33.000 --> 44:34.000
Hoop.

44:34.000 --> 44:35.000
Hoop.

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
You guys are amazing.

44:37.000 --> 44:38.000

Like every episode,

44:45.000 --> 44:46.000
I don't close the show.

44:46.000 --> 44:47.000
We're going to go to the host of Where in the World

All geographic information was accurate

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
from the date this reunion was recorded.

45:59.000 --> 46:04.000
Where in the world is Carmen Cinego?
