0	28800	All these people want to know where in the world is Carmen San Diego?
28800	35200	Hello again, Gumshoots. I'm Adam Wurzel. Welcome to a very special edition of Hosts at Home.
35200	41320	Now, we knew for our upcoming second season that we wanted to interview Greg Lee, the host of several of your favorite shows.
41320	52840	But today is truly special because for the first time since 1995, we are reuniting the cast of the hit PBS game show where in the world is Carmen San Diego.
52840	64000	That's right. With us, Acme, senior agent in charge of training new recruits, Greg Lee, also the gentleman, of course, the gentleman who performed as the house band on the show.
64000	72200	They're all here too, Sean Altman, Scott Leonard, Elliot Kerman, Barry Carl, and Jeff Thatcher, better known as Rockapella.
72200	78000	Of course, the Rockapella incarnation of the early to mid-90s. Gentlemen, great to see all of you.
78000	79000	Great to see you.
79000	80000	You too.
80000	81000	Great to see you, Adam.
81160	87000	So, we always start each episode of Hosts at Home by asking, where is home for you? Greg, we'll start with you.
87000	92000	These days, it's in Santa Monica, California. Sean?
92000	96000	I live in Manhattan with my wife and my daughter.
96000	98000	How about you, Scott?
98000	102000	I live in New York City, but I've escaped to Florida at the moment.
102000	104000	How about you, Jeff?
104000	109000	I live in Denver for two years now, but I used to live in New York City. I'm probably coming back.
110000	112000	Ooh!
112000	115000	East, east, east.
115000	117000	How about you, Barry?
117000	122000	I'm about 20 miles north of Manhattan in farm country.
122000	125000	Oh, Elliot?
125000	128000	I'm also in Manhattan, still.
128000	131000	Can I just say, Elliot, I love the hat. The hat is fantastic.
131000	135000	Thank you. It was a, it was a Carmen throwback.
135000	137000	Oh, very good.
137000	139000	Greg, let's start with you.
139000	145000	You were working at a very iconic place for other kids' game shows when you got the job on Carmen.
145000	150000	Tell everybody about that and how you transitioned into this role as host of Carmen San Diego.
150000	153000	Well, I, you know, I did a lot of stuff for Nickelodeon.
153000	157000	I started off as an audience warm-up guy for a lot of their stuff.
157000	161000	There was an old, old show called on CBS Saturday morning.
161000	163000	That's how long ago this was.
163000	168000	It was called Dr. Fad, which is about kids and inventions, I guess it was.
168000	173000	So I was doing a lot of audience warm-up and then some announcing stuff.
173000	176000	And then it was just a regular, you know, audition for, for Carmen.
176000	181000	And I'd been down in Florida doing some more Nickelodeon stuff down there for, for a total panic.
181000	186000	And then came back to New York and then we just had the audition with Carmen.
186000	187000	So we started there.
187000	190000	How involved were you in the development of the show?
191000	195000	Not much. They already had it pretty much going when I got there, you know.
195000	198000	I was trying not to screw it up too bad.
198000	200000	I remember my stuff.
200000	202000	Say the big words.
204000	206000	Elliot, Elliot, let's go over to you now.
206000	210000	Can you tell us a little bit more about the group's audition process for the show?
213000	216000	God, I don't know if I even remember that.
216000	218000	I think I can't remember what happened.
218000	220000	I think they, does anybody remember actually?
220000	221000	I do remember.
221000	224000	I remember at least how we got the audition.
224000	234000	So we had just Spike Lee and company do it acapella had aired and that was our first national prominence.
234000	244000	And sometime after that aired, I remember being in my closet in my, on East 10th Street in my apartment and the phone rang.
244000	249000	And it was way pre cell phone and I answered it and he said, my name is Dana Calderwood.
249000	260000	And I'm directing a show in development about that's based on a, on a, on a popular kids computer game.
260000	268000	And we saw you guys on Spike Lee and would you be interested in auditioning for the role of the house pan that I remember.
268000	271000	After that, I don't remember much at all.
271000	277000	Let's talk to you, Scott, because Scott, you joined rock a pella in 1991.
277000	281000	The same year as we're in the world is Carmen saying San Diego premiere.
281000	288000	Can you kind of just go in depth a little bit about how crazy life was for you in 1991.
288000	289000	It was crazy.
289000	296000	I just got back from work in Japan and wanted to move to New York.
296000	303000	And there was something in the backstage publication about various things, but one of the things is rock a pella.
303000	304000	It sounded like a good fit.
304000	308000	So I went out and sang with them and we decided to do it.
308000	318000	And then my first then to actually move up to New York, I think the, I moved up the first, the day before we had a meeting with the producers of Carmen San Diego.
318000	325000	So as soon as I got there, we started doing that and then a bunch of stuff hit.
325000	334000	Like we did a Whoopi Goldberg HBO special and Taco Bell commercial for the MTV movie awards.
334000	336000	And then we then Billy Joel.
342000	345000	And it's all been downhill for 30 years.
348000	356000	I thought it was really going to be great hoping to get back there.
356000	363000	Sean, let's, let's chat with you because we can't move forward without talking about this iconic theme song.
363000	367000	How did you get the idea for the theme song of the show?
368000	379000	I wish there was a, I had an erudite explanation, but I really think it was a weird beginner's luck because I wasn't a, now I consider myself a songwriter.
379000	386000	But when I wrote that, I think I considered myself someone who had an ear for something catchy.
386000	399000	But I think I kind of got lucky and it was, you know, they, they told us they wanted music and, and I had this idea for the, for the thing.
399000	412000	Somewhere around a microcosette, I have like the recording of me calling it, calling into my answering machine because that was before there was smartphones where you could record an idea.
412000	421000	And, you know, the, the most seasoned songwriter I knew was my old high school friend, David Yasbeck.
421000	424000	And I said, I've got, I've got three ideas.
424000	426000	What is any of these any good?
426000	429000	And he said, this one is the good one.
429000	431000	And I said, would you, would you help me flesh it out?
431000	432000	And he did.
432000	435000	And, and we did a demo and the group liked it.
435000	438000	And next thing you know, it was on TV.
438000	445000	And we never had any concept that it would be featured in the way that it was.
445000	447000	That was really unusual.
447000	459000	And I think that's pretty much explains why the song has a lasting impact is that we were on camera singing it or lip syncing it every day.
459000	465000	But, you know, what kind of, what theme song gets that kind of placement anymore.
465000	470000	So that was, it was a weird confluence of happy accidents and luck.
478000	483000	Rockapella was featured prominently throughout all five seasons of where in the world is Carmencindiego.
483000	487000	Barry, you guys did these song clues throughout the show.
487000	495000	A lot of times these clues were arrangements that Rockapella had already done live with new lyrics.
495000	498000	How quickly did you have to learn all of this material?
498000	513000	The group was just, it was kind of mind blowing to sit in a dressing room and without a keyboard or anything throw together arrangements of songs and then go on the set and record them.
514000	526000	I felt like I was working with a bunch of like most art level geniuses because we figured out parts and jammed, you know, they'd write these lyrics and we jam them into songs.
526000	535000	And we were kind of used to doing that anyway with industrial shows, you know, taking songs from our repertoire and putting somebody else's lyrics to them.
535000	545000	But now when I look back and I watch one of those clues, I go, damn, that was tight.
546000	549000	For our next clue, here's Rockapella.
563000	570000	Fifteen minutes ago we put this together and went out and did it. It was just, it was an amazing process.
570000	574000	Does anybody remember, did we even use cue cards? Because I don't recall.
574000	576000	Sometimes.
576000	577000	Okay.
577000	582000	But also what was crazy was that I think in the first three seasons we did them live.
582000	588000	It wasn't until the latter, maybe the fourth and the fifth season that they started taping our clues.
588000	597000	So we would literally have to put together an arrangement, do the arrangement, learn the thing and then go out and sing it live during the show.
597000	600000	Look at me, something's going on out here, let's find out what it is.
600000	602000	Hey guys, what's up?
602000	606000	Calypso, one, two, three, four.
606000	609000	That's too bad.
609000	612000	Trich tebellise.
612000	618000	It was a zombie jamboree, took place in an island cemetery.
618000	627000	It was a zombie jamboree on an island in the Caribbean Sea, just south of the Woodward Islands.
627000	630000	You can hear some great Calypso bands.
630000	633000	Zombies love the season of Garneval.
633000	636000	They get together and back on out.
636000	641000	First year, they would do the whole show straight through.
641000	643000	They started splitting it up.
643000	646000	They would do all the end games, right?
646000	649000	That first was like a radio show, it was crazy.
649000	653000	It was horrible.
653000	656000	We were there very late at night too.
656000	660000	Very early, very early.
660000	664000	I didn't see spring for five years.
664000	671000	You guys may not have known, remember the first several shows, they kept changing the rules?
671000	672000	Were you aware of that?
672000	675000	They continued to change as we were going.
675000	680000	The scoring system on today's Carmen San Diego is different, but the game is the same.
680000	684000	That's not happening, now we're going to do this, and it was just so horrible.
684000	688000	You were really good though by the seat of your pants.
688000	692000	I think I was just dazed, it's very kind of that.
692000	695000	Boy, you look cool.
695000	697000	It's the coat baby, it's the coat.
697000	702000	And this is special agent in charge of training new recruits, Reg Lee!
702000	704000	Reg Lee!
704000	706000	Reg Lee!
706000	709000	Reg Lee!
709000	716000	Seriously, that first year was a lot of reinventing the wheel as we were going.
716000	721000	And I still have some parents who were mad at me from the first season.
721000	728000	Because if you guys remember, as Scott said, we would do the whole thing, or Elliot said,
728000	730000	we would do the whole thing all the way through.
730000	734000	So you would do all the business with you guys and the songs, you were doing those live,
734000	738000	and I would go to Lin's office and she'd be sitting back there, we'd do our bit, we'd come back out, we'd keep rolling.
738000	742000	We'd go right into the middle part, into the big map part.
742000	750000	And the rules of the big map for the first season, at least for most of it was, I had to give three clues for each country.
750000	753000	So while the kids staying in there was the same.
753000	756000	Let me tell you a little bit about this particular country.
756000	760000	In the iron ore, and it's a very temporary area.
760000	763000	Just tell me the name of the country, man!
763000	765000	On your mark, get set, go!
765000	771000	Side of landmark civil rights protest, it's capitalist Montgomery, Carmen went to Alabama.
771000	774000	Alright, sorry, try it again.
774000	776000	That's it, okay!
776000	781000	Come on, let's go! The nation's leading dairy producer, it's capitalist Madison, Carmen went to Wisconsin.
781000	785000	Rattling off all this information, carrots are mad, I can see him up to the side.
785000	788000	They're screaming, why is he reading so slow?
788000	791000	That got changed relatively early.
791000	796000	I don't remember any pilots, but I do remember just, as they said, a lot of the beginning time,
796000	800000	just kind of making it up and staying very late and getting up very early.
800000	807000	But it was a, I gotta tell you man, it was still some of the best friends I've ever had working ever.
807000	811000	Met my wife on that show, and it was just one of the greatest experiences.
811000	815000	Because I think it was more than, you know, it was more than just a game show.
815000	820000	I think it was a lot going on there, and I wish they still had something like it,
820000	823000	because you know, I think one of the things we always said about that show was,
823000	829000	people would always ask, you know, do you really think you could teach kids about geography in such a short period of time?
829000	835000	We would always say, well no, but we can't get them excited about it and interested in it.
835000	843000	Because it's not just about the places on the map, you know, you got people there and cultures and food and religion and all these wonderful traditions.
843000	849000	And as we've seen the world get so much smaller, you know, it seems so much more important to be aware of that.
849000	854000	And I kind of, I'm sorry that they still don't have something like that.
854000	858000	They can do that for kids and for us too.
858000	863000	Greg, when did you, at some point I know you started writing for the show.
863000	864000	Yeah.
864000	869000	And I was, I remember being really happy because I felt like you were, you know,
869000	875000	I always felt like I was completely in the dark about anything having to do with the inner workings of the show.
875000	878000	You know, I felt like I did what I was told.
878000	886000	But at some point you started writing, and that must have been very sort of freeing and creatively exciting for you.
886000	894000	Yeah, it really was, it really was fun, you know, because working with you guys and of course with Lynn was just such a, I always felt very,
894000	900000	because like I said, I'd basically come from audience warm up and out, so it was still kind of new to me to even do any of this kind of stuff.
900000	905000	And I always felt like I was, you know, learning so much from you guys and from Lynn too.
905000	910000	And remember when it dawned on me that she was hilarious.
910000	914000	Like, I don't know that they really realized how hilarious she is.
914000	918000	And that's if I could just take a few shots at starting to write some stuff.
918000	922000	You know, I started with those, what we call Jilos, the Greg and Lynn's office, you know.
922000	929000	And I said, I remember saying, for a while, my character kept taking all the hits.
929000	933000	And I kept saying, I think my character is the kid and she's like the parrot.
933000	937000	And I'm telling you, she can't hit herself in the face with a boxing glove and fall back.
937000	940000	And it will be funny because she's hilarious.
940000	947000	And remember that just for a lot of the writers, it seemed like it opened a lot of possibilities because she was so great.
947000	953000	And you guys were always so up for anything and, you know, and for whatever could happen.
953000	956000	It just opened so many things that we get so fun.
956000	959000	So I wasn't just the guy having to read those cards.
959000	962000	Did you write the Floyd the Barber stuff?
962000	967000	Yeah, Floyd the Barber.
967000	971000	Which is basically my brother preacher character, which is basically the mayor from Doug.
971000	972000	It's all the same.
972000	974000	No, no, nonsense.
974000	976000	That burning sensation is normal.
976000	979000	Well, it's the puffiness that has me concerned.
979000	980000	Be back with you just a little bit.
980000	981000	Hi, Craig.
981000	985000	Of course, there is one cast member, as Greg said, that is no longer with us.
985000	988000	Jeff, tell us about your memories of Lynn Thigbin.
988000	991000	You know, Lynn, you know, she's a total professional.
991000	995000	I've come to learn over the years how much she was respected.
995000	998000	Every show, she did a lot of shows.
998000	1002000	Not just PBS goofy stuff, but really serious drama stuff.
1002000	1004000	And there's just so much respect for her.
1004000	1008000	And I'm sorry to not have her here.
1008000	1010000	For our next clue.
1026000	1029000	She was a great singer.
1029000	1032000	So we got to sing what she did, the number with a few numbers with us.
1032000	1035000	And when she would sing and tear it up, it was really something.
1035000	1037000	She won a Tony Award.
1037000	1042000	And she was the, she played the stage manager in the movie Tootsie.
1042000	1043000	Oh my God.
1043000	1046000	She's kind of, you know, she's an icon.
1046000	1050000	And such a nice, they're nice to us.
1050000	1052000	Just always really warm to us.
1052000	1053000	She was lovely.
1053000	1055000	A lovely, and she was very generous.
1055000	1057000	She's a very lovely, generous person.
1057000	1059000	She was a joy spreader.
1059000	1066000	And I thought she just kind of up leveled the whole production.
1066000	1070000	She was probably the one real pro amongst us.
1070000	1074000	No offense, Greg.
1074000	1075000	I totally agree.
1075000	1077000	I was the act that was the way.
1077000	1078000	Yeah.
1078000	1082000	This is Lynn Fitzpinn speaking for where in the world is Carmen Sandiego.
1082000	1086000	And remember, criminals are mean and greedy.
1086000	1090000	But act me good like Steve and Edie.
1090000	1097000	They hired us to do the next generation of Rockapella to do the where in the world is Carmen Sandiego planetarium show.
1097000	1099000	You remember that, Scott?
1099000	1101000	And we, it was like surround sound.
1101000	1103000	It was supposed to be on a dome and a planetarium.
1103000	1105000	It was after this show it ended.
1105000	1108000	And I was so relieved to see that she was part of that.
1108000	1113000	Because we felt, to me it seemed like a little bit adrift without her.
1113000	1117000	And there she was, comfortingly talking about planets and stars.
1117000	1136000	None of you guys have a Tony award like Lynn did.
1136000	1139000	But there was a lot of acting on this show.
1139000	1145000	From the outside looking in, it kind of felt like Scott and Barry that you guys were doing most of the acting.
1145000	1148000	Barry, we'll start with you. Did you come from an acting background?
1148000	1157000	I did, but let's make a distinction here between acting like Lynn did and shtick like we did.
1157000	1159000	Well, I take offense at that.
1159000	1161000	What do you imply?
1161000	1163000	The fine art of shtick.
1163000	1165000	I'm sorry, Scott.
1165000	1168000	Before me, it wasn't, that's fine.
1169000	1171000	Okay, I was deeply committed.
1171000	1177000	Stanislavski method, really getting in there, really penetrating the character.
1177000	1182000	You know, I had a long, passionate relationship with Mrs. Pumpkin-Clanger.
1182000	1191000	The stench of crime lies heavy upon us, like a patient etherized upon a table.
1191000	1200000	And alas, my downstairs neighbors are the clumsy surgeon entrusted with its cure.
1200000	1203000	Thank you, thank you, thank you.
1203000	1207000	Can you still do the voice, Barry? Can you still do the Mrs. Pumpkin-Clanger voice?
1207000	1209000	Griggy!
1209000	1211000	No, I guess not.
1212000	1222000	You know, the most interesting thing about that character was coming out of hair and makeup in my house dress and full drag,
1222000	1230000	I had a bra and each cup was stuffed with two pairs of like thick athletic socks.
1230000	1236000	And even though the camera crew, everybody knew me, you know, it's like, it was me.
1236000	1242000	But there I was in, you know, a wig and makeup with these huge tits.
1242000	1247000	And the poor guys in the camera crew, they couldn't help looking at them.
1247000	1254000	And I was like, guys, guys, it sucks. It's me, it sucks.
1254000	1258000	You're not looking at what you think you're looking at, but I know you can't help it.
1258000	1260000	It's really funny.
1261000	1267000	Scott, the Emmy for Best Dying Informant goes to you.
1278000	1280000	I think we have a serious problem on our hands.
1280000	1283000	Do you ever lose your voice from all that screaming?
1283000	1289000	I basically scream for a living. I mean, if you've listened to the parts of rock and pellets.
1290000	1294000	Yeah, I don't think I've ever, well, I've lost my voice funny. Yeah, sure.
1294000	1296000	But not from the dying informant.
1314000	1318000	With me, it wasn't really shtick. It was shtick because I was such a wooden actor.
1319000	1326000	But we did. But it was, I guess, everybody's dream to put on an Elvis outfit and do Elvis.
1326000	1331000	So that was actually really, really fun. That was one of my favorite moments of the whole show.
1331000	1343000	That and consistently, actually, the middle game was absolutely phenomenally crazy on the edge of a cliff fun.
1343000	1345000	Aruba's fruit market.
1346000	1347000	No.
1347000	1349000	Aruba's fruit market.
1349000	1352000	I tensioned fruit market shoppers. Still no.
1352000	1353000	Stampede.
1356000	1358000	That sounded like a real stampede.
1365000	1374000	Trying to get the warrant and the loot and like trying to crack Greg up and like that whole thing was just crazy live TV.
1375000	1376000	Your turn.
1376000	1377000	Gillette tassel.
1377000	1378000	Gillette tassel.
1379000	1380000	Ow!
1383000	1384000	Cut myself shaving, Greg.
1384000	1385000	Get it?
1385000	1386000	Why did you do that?
1386000	1387000	Oh, I don't know.
1390000	1401000	By the end, they would make us show them the list we had made of the terms for the loot because they got a little blue or a little bit too pushy, too edgy for PBS.
1401000	1405000	So we would have to have Howard, the producer, come and look at our list say, okay, okay.
1405000	1410000	My favorite was when they had that statue in Belgium of a little guy that's urinating.
1410000	1411000	Market piss.
1411000	1412000	Market piss.
1412000	1414000	And we said, little us, we, we.
1414000	1418000	And there was also like, European.
1418000	1420000	They vetoed that one.
1420000	1422000	They vetoed European?
1422000	1424000	Yeah, I was so disappointed.
1424000	1426000	I thought, European, okay.
1426000	1428000	It was like, no.
1429000	1433000	That would be totally allowed nowadays.
1433000	1435000	Bring on more pee.
1435000	1437000	We had the list of where everything was.
1437000	1443000	And when they were, when they said something, we would all go into this, like a sprinter's crouch.
1443000	1448000	You know, and we were, you, you would hear the breathing of the guy next to you to know when to come in.
1448000	1452000	It was, it was, it was athletic and very exciting.
1452000	1453000	The warrants.
1453000	1454000	The loot and the warrant.
1454000	1455000	Do you remember where Sarah is?
1455000	1456000	The dinosaur's state park.
1456000	1459000	Is she still at the dinosaur's state park?
1473000	1478000	That was like one of the most creative parts of the show is that we would actually get to write like five or six of them.
1478000	1482000	And we were so, so frustrating when the kid would get it quickly.
1482000	1486000	We didn't get to use this brilliant comedy, right?
1486000	1489000	I think, I think we came up, I don't think we started with the loot.
1489000	1493000	I think the loot came after they started censoring us.
1493000	1502000	And so when they censored us like with European and look at what those ones, then we would just be pissed and say, the loot.
1503000	1504000	Yes.
1508000	1512000	Jeff, when you, when you joined this group, I mean, what were your first thoughts?
1512000	1516000	Cause I mean, these are some, some wild and zany people.
1516000	1517000	Yeah.
1517000	1521000	I had seen them on the Spike Lee special that they got Carmen from.
1521000	1529000	And for my audition, I had to interpret the sequence drum sounds from the soundtrack album to Carmen San Diego.
1529000	1533000	That was one of the things that Sean had me do in my hotel room audition.
1533000	1536000	So when I got there, it was, you know, it was a well oiled machine.
1536000	1544000	It was already in Queens in Kauffman Astoria Studios and Elliott would pick me up in his car service in the Upper West side of New York.
1544000	1547000	And we would, off we would go to this crazy thing that I'd never seen before.
1547000	1558000	I'd worked in production staff for TV for a couple of years, but I had not been a part of something this colorful and seemingly freewheeling, I guess you could say.
1558000	1566000	And, and I, you know, that something that these guys have kind of alluded to, there was definitely a little bit of a rebellious vibe.
1566000	1570000	There was a creative versus structure kind of thing going on.
1570000	1577000	That was really interesting to watch because that kind of sense of rebellion is kind of what Rockefeller is in many ways in my interpretation.
1577000	1580000	I've seen that a lot and it's, and it's something that is hilarious.
1580000	1584000	What's going to happen is Greg's going to come out and Scott's pants are down.
1584000	1587000	And Greg's going to cry.
1587000	1589000	The right one.
1589000	1591000	Yes!
1596000	1599000	Go Dino, go, go, uh, word.
1599000	1601000	Let's see if I can look from there.
1601000	1603000	Oh, there you go.
1603000	1605000	Well, I have to use that one. I'm locking it.
1606000	1608000	That's a good one. You can use that?
1608000	1609000	Yeah, I'm supposed to do it.
1609000	1612000	There's a fine shit of, what do you call those things again?
1613000	1615000	Fiber optic sparklers.
1615000	1622000	I knew how a TV show was made, but I had not seen that level of creativity in action like moment to moment.
1622000	1623000	It was really interesting.
1623000	1626000	There was a lot of moving parts to this show.
1626000	1630000	Greg, what was the most challenging part of your job?
1631000	1635000	Well, I mean, I make jokes about it, but I really did.
1635000	1637000	It was hard for me to read those cards.
1637000	1639000	I mean, some of those names are very hard for me.
1639000	1643000	I'm a fairly dyslexic person, and I mean, seriously dyslexic.
1643000	1646000	And so some of those were like, you got me kidding me, man.
1646000	1648000	I couldn't even pronounce them. I read them.
1648000	1650000	Okay, guys, name the city, if you will, please.
1650000	1654000	Is it Bratislava, Gdansk, or Odessa?
1654000	1656000	Remember the clues that we heard on the Danube River?
1656000	1658000	The answer we're looking for is Panampen.
1658000	1659000	Nice job, guys.
1659000	1662000	Kunming, Hong Kong, or Taipei?
1662000	1663000	Remember the clues that we heard.
1663000	1664000	Thanks a lot.
1664000	1666000	If there was ever any pressure about it,
1666000	1669000	that for me was always the hardest part,
1669000	1673000	to just be rolling and then have a Herzegovina sitting there.
1673000	1675000	I have no idea what that's like.
1675000	1677000	What in the world is that?
1677000	1679000	So that was always the hardest part for me.
1679000	1682000	The rest of it was fairly, you know, when you could move and do things,
1682000	1685000	it was fairly just enjoyable.
1685000	1687000	It was just fun, you know.
1687000	1689000	And of course, the map was the most fun,
1689000	1693000	just because that's the time that I felt like I was the kid's teammate.
1693000	1696000	So you just really wanted me to get there.
1696000	1700000	Do you think your geography skills got better through the years?
1700000	1701000	Possibly.
1701000	1705000	I mean, they were okay before, I guess.
1705000	1707000	I remember the, I don't know if you guys remember this,
1707000	1711000	but I think it was at the very first show.
1711000	1715000	It was early on, I remember that the Soviet Union broke up
1715000	1717000	right before we went to Tape one night.
1717000	1718000	Do you guys remember this?
1718000	1719000	Yes.
1719000	1722000	They changed all the maps like the night before.
1722000	1724000	The lyrics.
1724000	1726000	Check in Slovakia.
1726000	1727000	Yeah.
1727000	1729000	So everything had changed like the night before.
1729000	1734000	So they'd been up all night changing the big map that we're going to use that day.
1734000	1739000	That story has an ending somewhere, but I don't have it right now.
1739000	1743000	Can we, while I have everybody here,
1743000	1746000	and I want to kind of set the record straight,
1746000	1749000	because Barry before we went on told me a story, Greg,
1749000	1753000	about this unique accident that happened on set between the two of you.
1753000	1755000	Do you remember that, Greg?
1755000	1756000	Who was it?
1756000	1757000	What was the, who was it?
1757000	1759000	Between you and Barry, an accident happened.
1759000	1761000	To me, Barry?
1761000	1762000	Barry knows it.
1762000	1764000	Barry, you know it?
1764000	1766000	It sounds like an unplanned pregnancy.
1766000	1768000	The 10 ton weight?
1768000	1770000	10 ton weight?
1770000	1772000	No, no.
1772000	1774000	No, but as you remember,
1774000	1779000	actually we were rehearsing one of the big baby scenes.
1779000	1780000	Yeah.
1780000	1782000	And I was making a lot of noise.
1782000	1784000	I was probably crying.
1784000	1790000	And you silenced me by shoving a big binky in my mouth.
1790000	1792000	Yeah.
1792000	1795000	I don't know what got into you that day,
1795000	1799000	but it just slugged me in the mouth.
1799000	1802000	I had this big, huge, fat lip.
1802000	1804000	Oh my gosh.
1804000	1808000	I was like, I have no memory of that.
1808000	1810000	Well, my mouth remembers.
1810000	1812000	I'm so sorry.
1812000	1813000	Wow, that must be...
1813000	1815000	Well, Greg, you apologized at the time.
1815000	1817000	There was no hard feelings.
1817000	1821000	I just remember that enormous binky, you know, slamming into my mouth.
1821000	1823000	It's been years of therapy.
1823000	1826000	You know, we're good.
1826000	1828000	I do remember hitting the shower with a snowball
1828000	1830000	when we had that big run around.
1830000	1833000	Yeah, that's one of the ones that's on YouTube.
1833000	1836000	Now, we have just heard that Nimoy has left Conakry.
1836000	1838000	So let's pick up the chase.
1838000	1841000	The chase.
1841000	1843000	Quite enough of this, mister.
1843000	1845000	It's on you right now.
1855000	1858000	No, no, no.
1859000	1862000	No, no, no, no.
1862000	1864000	Thank you.
1866000	1868000	My daughter loves that one, but it was good.
1868000	1872000	And when I watched that, my main impression is,
1872000	1875000	wow, I could run.
1875000	1877000	Because now it gets better.
1877000	1879000	But that was good.
1879000	1882000	And also, you know, I remember it's like,
1882000	1885000	some of the stuff we did was, I wouldn't call it athletic,
1886000	1889000	the four or the five of us crammed into the doorway
1889000	1892000	to sing to Greg, sing some of those clues.
1892000	1895000	I don't know how we did that because we were all,
1895000	1897000	three of us, two of us must have been on our knees
1897000	1900000	and we were all just kind of squished in there.
1916000	1919000	That pizza robot, yeah.
1919000	1922000	Whoa, that pizza robot.
1922000	1926000	Bring back, bring back that pizza robot
1926000	1930000	because we're getting lonely for some pepperoni.
1930000	1932000	We remember banks, banks, banks.
1932000	1935000	We had this, where we had to sing the three of us.
1935000	1937000	That was good.
1937000	1939000	Four of us were like singing some background thing
1939000	1942000	and our lyric was banks, banks, banks.
1942000	1945000	And we, like before the skit, we said,
1945000	1947000	okay, on banks, banks, banks, we're all going to jump,
1947000	1949000	hop on each banks.
1949000	1953000	And of course, so like, we all got together except for Sean
1953000	1955000	and said like, let's not do it.
1955000	1958000	So Sean's is hopping banks, banks, banks, and we're not.
1958000	1960000	Oh my God, it's great.
1960000	1962000	Whoa.
1962000	1965000	Banks, banks, banks, banks, banks, banks.
1965000	1967000	Whoa.
1967000	1969000	Hey, hey, I think we got the point.
1969000	1970000	Thank you.
1970000	1973000	I think we got the final taped episode of Carmen.
1973000	1977000	Sean cut off, or Greg dressed as the barber.
1977000	1979000	You cut off Sean's iconic braids,
1979000	1982000	but is it true that nobody else knew what was going to happen?
1982000	1986000	Thank you for calling the braids iconic.
1986000	1994000	I look back at them with the mixture of embarrassment and.
1994000	1998000	That was the 90s spent a lot of money on this.
1998000	2001000	I remember that the only people that knew was going to happen
2001000	2004000	were Greg and I guess the director and one of the producers.
2004000	2009000	I think maybe I was done with wearing an 80s haircut in the 90s.
2009000	2016000	Ask, have I been swigging too much from the flask?
2016000	2019000	Why cut my braids?
2019000	2027000	You wonder, I've been Schmoderich and Stevie Blunder.
2027000	2030000	It's been 10 years.
2030000	2031000	Yes.
2031000	2032000	Count them.
2032000	2034000	A 12 on Twitter.
2034000	2037000	American dollars.
2037000	2041000	I just found almost all of those braids.
2041000	2045000	I'm going to try to sell them.
2045000	2049000	Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?
2049000	2050000	Tell me.
2050000	2053000	Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?
2053000	2054000	Tell me.
2054000	2058000	Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?
2058000	2061000	This has been for where in the world is Carmen Sandiego.
2061000	2064000	And remember, the Acme Triangle of Excellence.
2064000	2068000	Vigilance, dedication, courage.
2068000	2070000	Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?
2070000	2074000	Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?
2074000	2079000	Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?
2079000	2084000	All geographic information was accurate as of the date this program was recorded.
2084000	2087000	Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?
2087000	2090000	Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?
2090000	2094000	Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?
2094000	2097000	Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?
2097000	2099000	It's on the back.
2099000	2101000	It's on the back, y'all.
2101000	2102000	Look at that.
2102000	2104000	That's what I call a buzz cut.
2104000	2105000	Awesome.
2105000	2106000	We're really cooking.
2106000	2111000	Including all the hair gentlemen, I mean, I truly loved where in the world is Carmen Sandiego.
2111000	2112000	Every element.
2112000	2114000	Greg, Rockefeller.
2114000	2118000	So the big question is, why do you change a show?
2118000	2121000	Why do you make a show where in time is Carmen Sandiego?
2121000	2123000	When the show was already such a huge hit.
2123000	2128000	Tell me where in time is Carmen Sandiego?
2129000	2138000	I remember somebody, somebody in power telling me it's easier to get funding for a new show
2138000	2142000	than to get an existing show refunded.
2142000	2143000	Wow.
2143000	2145000	I don't know how that works.
2145000	2146000	It was disappointing.
2146000	2156000	I mean, especially in retrospect, when you realize now how valuable to a career being on television is.
2156000	2163000	At the time, maybe, I can't speak for everyone else, but at the time, you know, I remember thinking,
2163000	2169000	oh, you know, we'll get on another TV show or some other amazing thing will happen.
2169000	2172000	But, you know, these things don't happen very often.
2172000	2178000	And to be on television every day is, wow, that's a powerful thing for a career.
2178000	2184000	That sound means it is time for the lightning round, just like on Carmen Sandiego.
2184000	2185000	You're on host home.
2185000	2187000	We also have a round.
2187000	2189000	Are you guys up for a challenge?
2189000	2191000	Yes, sir.
2191000	2193000	Scott says reluctantly.
2193000	2194000	Yes, sir.
2194000	2195000	Here's what's going to happen.
2195000	2199000	Let's see how well you know your Carmen Sandiego crooks.
2199000	2200000	I'm going to go to each of you.
2200000	2202000	I'm going to ask you to name a crook.
2202000	2206000	We're going to keep going until we have one winner.
2206000	2208000	Name any Carmen Sandiego crook.
2208000	2210000	Jeff, we're going to start with you.
2210000	2212000	It's a brute.
2212000	2214000	Elias.
2214000	2216000	Nick the slick.
2216000	2218000	Barry.
2221000	2224000	I lose.
2224000	2226000	Greg.
2226000	2228000	Eddie Larisony.
2228000	2230000	Scott.
2230000	2232000	Top Grunge.
2232000	2234000	John.
2234000	2236000	Ni ni ni ni ni ni moi.
2236000	2239000	Ni ni ni ni ni moi.
2239000	2241000	That was great, by the way.
2241000	2242000	That was great.
2242000	2244000	Back over to you, Jeff.
2244000	2246000	Oh, God, what's left?
2246000	2248000	Those two guys, the twins.
2248000	2249000	Double trouble.
2249000	2251000	Yes, double trouble.
2251000	2252000	Elias.
2252000	2255000	That was the last one I could remember was double trouble.
2255000	2257000	You have five left.
2257000	2258000	Oh my God.
2258000	2259000	Five left?
2259000	2261000	There's five left.
2261000	2263000	Hint, hint, hint.
2263000	2265000	I got a line.
2265000	2266000	Three seconds.
2266000	2267000	No idea.
2267000	2269000	All right, there's Scott.
2269000	2271000	There's four more left.
2271000	2273000	I got nothing.
2273000	2274000	All right.
2274000	2276000	I'll give you guys a hint.
2276000	2278000	Oh.
2278000	2279000	Robo crook.
2279000	2281000	Robo crook.
2281000	2283000	And the Contessa.
2283000	2285000	Contessa.
2285000	2288000	And Nana rap, but people didn't realize that.
2288000	2290000	She was very diverse.
2290000	2292000	She was.
2292000	2294000	She had suffered a lot.
2294000	2296000	She's no good.
2296000	2297000	Nana.
2297000	2299000	You got the Nana.
2299000	2301000	Nana.
2301000	2304000	By the way, the two that nobody named just so we can put everybody
2304000	2307000	out of their misery was Sarah Nade.
2307000	2308000	Oh yeah.
2308000	2309000	Sarah Nade.
2309000	2311000	Okay, that was the rock one.
2311000	2312000	Yeah.
2312000	2315000	And then nobody, nobody names Carmen San Diego.
2315000	2316000	Oh.
2316000	2318000	Well, we want to talk about that.
2318000	2320000	We want to talk about that.
2320000	2323000	We want to talk about what everybody's doing now.
2323000	2324000	Scott,
2324000	2327000	you have been in rock appella coming up on 30 years and you're
2327000	2329000	still making great music with rock appella.
2329000	2332000	But you hear that statistic that Scott Leonard has been with
2332000	2334000	rock appella for 30 years.
2334000	2336000	Does it surprise you?
2336000	2337000	Yeah, it's kind of,
2337000	2338000	I don't,
2338000	2340000	it doesn't really mean anything to me.
2340000	2341000	I'm like,
2341000	2344000	it may after day just get up and do it again and then it just
2344000	2345000	accumulates like that.
2345000	2346000	I guess.
2346000	2347000	Crazy.
2347000	2351000	I can't believe it's been 30 years since we did Carmen San
2351000	2352000	Diego.
2352000	2353000	I mean,
2353000	2354000	that's another life.
2354000	2355000	Yeah.
2355000	2356000	And Jeff,
2356000	2358000	you're also still with rock appella.
2358000	2361000	Can you tell us what the group is up to nowadays?
2361000	2362000	Well,
2362000	2364000	we never stopped making stuff.
2364000	2368000	And we've had a lot of albums and,
2368000	2369000	you know,
2369000	2370000	folders,
2370000	2372000	coffee commercials and all kinds of things like that.
2372000	2373000	So, you know,
2373000	2376000	if that sound is something that you enjoy,
2376000	2378000	please come and check us out.
2403000	2404000	Elliot,
2404000	2407000	you left rock appella in 2004 and I'm really jealous of you
2407000	2412000	because you work on my wife and my absolute like favorite TV
2412000	2413000	show,
2413000	2414000	besides Carmen,
2414000	2415000	of course,
2415000	2416000	can you tell us about that?
2416000	2417000	Um,
2417000	2419000	I guess you're talking about the marvelous Mrs.
2419000	2420000	Maisel.
2420000	2421000	Yeah.
2421000	2422000	But,
2422000	2423000	um,
2423000	2424000	so I work on my,
2424000	2426000	I built a business over the years.
2426000	2427000	Consulting on,
2427000	2432000	and submitting tax incentive applications for many,
2432000	2433000	many,
2433000	2435000	many TV shows and films in New York.
2435000	2436000	Um,
2436000	2438000	so I work for big studios.
2438000	2439000	Um,
2439000	2441000	and one of them is one of the,
2441000	2443000	one of my shows is the marvelous Mrs.
2443000	2444000	Maisel.
2444000	2445000	Wow.
2445000	2446000	It's a fantastic show.
2446000	2447000	How about you, Barry?
2447000	2448000	Oh,
2448000	2449000	how about you?
2449000	2450000	What are you up to?
2450000	2451000	Well,
2451000	2452000	you know,
2452000	2454000	I left a great deal of work.
2454000	2455000	Um,
2455000	2456000	and my,
2456000	2460000	my primary incentive was my kids were growing up without me.
2460000	2461000	Um,
2461000	2465000	so I spent a good amount of time kind of having a relationship with
2465000	2466000	my kids,
2466000	2468000	which went by really fast, you know,
2468000	2471000	because then college happened and out of the house.
2471000	2472000	Um,
2472000	2476000	I retrained as a, as a, um,
2476000	2477000	therapist.
2477000	2478000	And,
2478000	2479000	um,
2479000	2481000	I've been doing that for,
2481000	2482000	gosh,
2482000	2483000	15 years.
2483000	2484000	Uh,
2484000	2485000	but I,
2485000	2487000	I still get to do music and I have,
2487000	2488000	I,
2488000	2489000	I've been doing voiceovers for
2489000	2492000	since 1983.
2492000	2493000	I think.
2493000	2494000	Um,
2494000	2498000	so I'm still basically doing everything that I was doing,
2498000	2500000	except singing with the guys and,
2500000	2501000	and traveling.
2501000	2502000	Um,
2502000	2505000	so I'm still basically doing everything that I was doing,
2505000	2507000	singing with the guys and,
2507000	2509000	and traveling.
2509000	2511000	And of course we have to mention this.
2511000	2512000	How could we forget?
2512000	2514000	You were the announcer of the game show.
2514000	2515000	You would have.
2515000	2516000	I was.
2516000	2517000	That's right.
2517000	2518000	Oh,
2518000	2520000	these people want to know.

2570000	2571000	you know,
2571000	2572000	when I was,
2572000	2574000	when I was focused on writing original music,
2574000	2577000	I used to laugh at tribute acts.
2577000	2578000	And now I've become,
2578000	2580000	that's what I do now.
2580000	2581000	And finally,

2593000	2594000	And,
