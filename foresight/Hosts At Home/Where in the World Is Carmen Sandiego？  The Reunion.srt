00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,800
All these people want to know where in the world is Carmen San Diego?

2
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:35,200
Hello again, Gumshoots. I'm Adam Wurzel. Welcome to a very special edition of Hosts at Home.

3
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:41,320
Now, we knew for our upcoming second season that we wanted to interview Greg Lee, the host of several of your favorite shows.

4
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:52,840
But today is truly special because for the first time since 1995, we are reuniting the cast of the hit PBS game show where in the world is Carmen San Diego.

5
00:00:52,840 --> 00:01:04,000
That's right. With us, Acme, senior agent in charge of training new recruits, Greg Lee, also the gentleman, of course, the gentleman who performed as the house band on the show.

6
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:12,200
They're all here too, Sean Altman, Scott Leonard, Elliot Kerman, Barry Carl, and Jeff Thatcher, better known as Rockapella.

7
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:18,000
Of course, the Rockapella incarnation of the early to mid-90s. Gentlemen, great to see all of you.

8
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Great to see you.

9
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You too.

10
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Great to see you, Adam.

11
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:27,000
So, we always start each episode of Hosts at Home by asking, where is home for you? Greg, we'll start with you.

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
These days, it's in Santa Monica, California. Sean?

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I live in Manhattan with my wife and my daughter.

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
How about you, Scott?

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I live in New York City, but I've escaped to Florida at the moment.

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
How about you, Jeff?

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I live in Denver for two years now, but I used to live in New York City. I'm probably coming back.

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Ooh!

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
East, east, east.

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
How about you, Barry?

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm about 20 miles north of Manhattan in farm country.

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Oh, Elliot?

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm also in Manhattan, still.

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Can I just say, Elliot, I love the hat. The hat is fantastic.

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Thank you. It was a, it was a Carmen throwback.

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Oh, very good.

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Greg, let's start with you.

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You were working at a very iconic place for other kids' game shows when you got the job on Carmen.

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Tell everybody about that and how you transitioned into this role as host of Carmen San Diego.

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Well, I, you know, I did a lot of stuff for Nickelodeon.

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I started off as an audience warm-up guy for a lot of their stuff.

32
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
There was an old, old show called on CBS Saturday morning.

33
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
That's how long ago this was.

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It was called Dr. Fad, which is about kids and inventions, I guess it was.

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So I was doing a lot of audience warm-up and then some announcing stuff.

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And then it was just a regular, you know, audition for, for Carmen.

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And I'd been down in Florida doing some more Nickelodeon stuff down there for, for a total panic.

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And then came back to New York and then we just had the audition with Carmen.

39
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So we started there.

40
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
How involved were you in the development of the show?

41
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Not much. They already had it pretty much going when I got there, you know.

42
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I was trying not to screw it up too bad.

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I remember my stuff.

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Say the big words.

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Elliot, Elliot, let's go over to you now.

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Can you tell us a little bit more about the group's audition process for the show?

47
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
God, I don't know if I even remember that.

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I think I can't remember what happened.

49
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I think they, does anybody remember actually?

50
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I do remember.

51
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I remember at least how we got the audition.

52
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So we had just Spike Lee and company do it acapella had aired and that was our first national prominence.

53
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And sometime after that aired, I remember being in my closet in my, on East 10th Street in my apartment and the phone rang.

54
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And it was way pre cell phone and I answered it and he said, my name is Dana Calderwood.

55
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And I'm directing a show in development about that's based on a, on a, on a popular kids computer game.

56
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And we saw you guys on Spike Lee and would you be interested in auditioning for the role of the house pan that I remember.

57
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
After that, I don't remember much at all.

58
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Let's talk to you, Scott, because Scott, you joined rock a pella in 1991.

59
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
The same year as we're in the world is Carmen saying San Diego premiere.

60
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Can you kind of just go in depth a little bit about how crazy life was for you in 1991.

61
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It was crazy.

62
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I just got back from work in Japan and wanted to move to New York.

63
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And there was something in the backstage publication about various things, but one of the things is rock a pella.

64
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It sounded like a good fit.

65
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So I went out and sang with them and we decided to do it.

66
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:18,000
And then my first then to actually move up to New York, I think the, I moved up the first, the day before we had a meeting with the producers of Carmen San Diego.

67
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So as soon as I got there, we started doing that and then a bunch of stuff hit.

68
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Like we did a Whoopi Goldberg HBO special and Taco Bell commercial for the MTV movie awards.

69
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And then we then Billy Joel.

70
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And it's all been downhill for 30 years.

71
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I thought it was really going to be great hoping to get back there.

72
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Sean, let's, let's chat with you because we can't move forward without talking about this iconic theme song.

73
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
How did you get the idea for the theme song of the show?

74
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I wish there was a, I had an erudite explanation, but I really think it was a weird beginner's luck because I wasn't a, now I consider myself a songwriter.

75
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:26,000
But when I wrote that, I think I considered myself someone who had an ear for something catchy.

76
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:39,000
But I think I kind of got lucky and it was, you know, they, they told us they wanted music and, and I had this idea for the, for the thing.

77
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Somewhere around a microcosette, I have like the recording of me calling it, calling into my answering machine because that was before there was smartphones where you could record an idea.

78
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And, you know, the, the most seasoned songwriter I knew was my old high school friend, David Yasbeck.

79
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And I said, I've got, I've got three ideas.

80
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
What is any of these any good?

81
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And he said, this one is the good one.

82
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And I said, would you, would you help me flesh it out?

83
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
And he did.

84
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
And, and we did a demo and the group liked it.

85
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
And next thing you know, it was on TV.

86
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,000
And we never had any concept that it would be featured in the way that it was.

87
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
That was really unusual.

88
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:39,000
And I think that's pretty much explains why the song has a lasting impact is that we were on camera singing it or lip syncing it every day.

89
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
But, you know, what kind of, what theme song gets that kind of placement anymore.

90
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So that was, it was a weird confluence of happy accidents and luck.

91
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Rockapella was featured prominently throughout all five seasons of where in the world is Carmencindiego.

92
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Barry, you guys did these song clues throughout the show.

93
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:15,000
A lot of times these clues were arrangements that Rockapella had already done live with new lyrics.

94
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
How quickly did you have to learn all of this material?

95
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:33,000
The group was just, it was kind of mind blowing to sit in a dressing room and without a keyboard or anything throw together arrangements of songs and then go on the set and record them.

96
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I felt like I was working with a bunch of like most art level geniuses because we figured out parts and jammed, you know, they'd write these lyrics and we jam them into songs.

97
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And we were kind of used to doing that anyway with industrial shows, you know, taking songs from our repertoire and putting somebody else's lyrics to them.

98
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:05,000
But now when I look back and I watch one of those clues, I go, damn, that was tight.

99
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
For our next clue, here's Rockapella.

100
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Fifteen minutes ago we put this together and went out and did it. It was just, it was an amazing process.

101
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Does anybody remember, did we even use cue cards? Because I don't recall.

102
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Sometimes.

103
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Okay.

104
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
But also what was crazy was that I think in the first three seasons we did them live.

105
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It wasn't until the latter, maybe the fourth and the fifth season that they started taping our clues.

106
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:57,000
So we would literally have to put together an arrangement, do the arrangement, learn the thing and then go out and sing it live during the show.

107
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Look at me, something's going on out here, let's find out what it is.

108
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Hey guys, what's up?

109
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Calypso, one, two, three, four.

110
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
That's too bad.

111
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Trich tebellise.

112
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It was a zombie jamboree, took place in an island cemetery.

113
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It was a zombie jamboree on an island in the Caribbean Sea, just south of the Woodward Islands.

114
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You can hear some great Calypso bands.

115
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Zombies love the season of Garneval.

116
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
They get together and back on out.

117
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
First year, they would do the whole show straight through.

118
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
They started splitting it up.

119
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
They would do all the end games, right?

120
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
That first was like a radio show, it was crazy.

121
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It was horrible.

122
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
We were there very late at night too.

123
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Very early, very early.

124
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I didn't see spring for five years.

125
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You guys may not have known, remember the first several shows, they kept changing the rules?

126
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Were you aware of that?

127
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
They continued to change as we were going.

128
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
The scoring system on today's Carmen San Diego is different, but the game is the same.

129
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
That's not happening, now we're going to do this, and it was just so horrible.

130
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
You were really good though by the seat of your pants.

131
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I think I was just dazed, it's very kind of that.

132
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Boy, you look cool.

133
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It's the coat baby, it's the coat.

134
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
And this is special agent in charge of training new recruits, Reg Lee!

135
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Reg Lee!

136
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Reg Lee!

137
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Reg Lee!

138
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Seriously, that first year was a lot of reinventing the wheel as we were going.

139
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
And I still have some parents who were mad at me from the first season.

140
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Because if you guys remember, as Scott said, we would do the whole thing, or Elliot said,

141
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
we would do the whole thing all the way through.

142
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
So you would do all the business with you guys and the songs, you were doing those live,

143
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
and I would go to Lin's office and she'd be sitting back there, we'd do our bit, we'd come back out, we'd keep rolling.

144
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
We'd go right into the middle part, into the big map part.

145
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And the rules of the big map for the first season, at least for most of it was, I had to give three clues for each country.

146
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
So while the kids staying in there was the same.

147
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Let me tell you a little bit about this particular country.

148
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
In the iron ore, and it's a very temporary area.

149
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Just tell me the name of the country, man!

150
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
On your mark, get set, go!

151
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Side of landmark civil rights protest, it's capitalist Montgomery, Carmen went to Alabama.

152
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Alright, sorry, try it again.

153
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
That's it, okay!

154
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Come on, let's go! The nation's leading dairy producer, it's capitalist Madison, Carmen went to Wisconsin.

155
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Rattling off all this information, carrots are mad, I can see him up to the side.

156
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
They're screaming, why is he reading so slow?

157
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
That got changed relatively early.

158
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I don't remember any pilots, but I do remember just, as they said, a lot of the beginning time,

159
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
just kind of making it up and staying very late and getting up very early.

160
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:27,000
But it was a, I gotta tell you man, it was still some of the best friends I've ever had working ever.

161
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Met my wife on that show, and it was just one of the greatest experiences.

162
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Because I think it was more than, you know, it was more than just a game show.

163
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I think it was a lot going on there, and I wish they still had something like it,

164
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
because you know, I think one of the things we always said about that show was,

165
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:49,000
people would always ask, you know, do you really think you could teach kids about geography in such a short period of time?

166
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,000
We would always say, well no, but we can't get them excited about it and interested in it.

167
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Because it's not just about the places on the map, you know, you got people there and cultures and food and religion and all these wonderful traditions.

168
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:09,000
And as we've seen the world get so much smaller, you know, it seems so much more important to be aware of that.

169
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
And I kind of, I'm sorry that they still don't have something like that.

170
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
They can do that for kids and for us too.

171
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Greg, when did you, at some point I know you started writing for the show.

172
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Yeah.

173
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
And I was, I remember being really happy because I felt like you were, you know,

174
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I always felt like I was completely in the dark about anything having to do with the inner workings of the show.

175
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
You know, I felt like I did what I was told.

176
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:46,000
But at some point you started writing, and that must have been very sort of freeing and creatively exciting for you.

177
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Yeah, it really was, it really was fun, you know, because working with you guys and of course with Lynn was just such a, I always felt very,

178
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,000
because like I said, I'd basically come from audience warm up and out, so it was still kind of new to me to even do any of this kind of stuff.

179
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
And I always felt like I was, you know, learning so much from you guys and from Lynn too.

180
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
And remember when it dawned on me that she was hilarious.

181
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Like, I don't know that they really realized how hilarious she is.

182
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And that's if I could just take a few shots at starting to write some stuff.

183
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
You know, I started with those, what we call Jilos, the Greg and Lynn's office, you know.

184
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:29,000
And I said, I remember saying, for a while, my character kept taking all the hits.

185
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
And I kept saying, I think my character is the kid and she's like the parrot.

186
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
And I'm telling you, she can't hit herself in the face with a boxing glove and fall back.

187
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
And it will be funny because she's hilarious.

188
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:47,000
And remember that just for a lot of the writers, it seemed like it opened a lot of possibilities because she was so great.

189
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:53,000
And you guys were always so up for anything and, you know, and for whatever could happen.

190
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It just opened so many things that we get so fun.

191
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
So I wasn't just the guy having to read those cards.

192
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Did you write the Floyd the Barber stuff?

193
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Yeah, Floyd the Barber.

194
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Which is basically my brother preacher character, which is basically the mayor from Doug.

195
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
It's all the same.

196
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
No, no, nonsense.

197
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
That burning sensation is normal.

198
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Well, it's the puffiness that has me concerned.

199
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Be back with you just a little bit.

200
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Hi, Craig.

201
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Of course, there is one cast member, as Greg said, that is no longer with us.

202
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Jeff, tell us about your memories of Lynn Thigbin.

203
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
You know, Lynn, you know, she's a total professional.

204
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I've come to learn over the years how much she was respected.

205
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Every show, she did a lot of shows.

206
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Not just PBS goofy stuff, but really serious drama stuff.

207
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
And there's just so much respect for her.

208
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
And I'm sorry to not have her here.

209
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
For our next clue.

210
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
She was a great singer.

211
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
So we got to sing what she did, the number with a few numbers with us.

212
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
And when she would sing and tear it up, it was really something.

213
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
She won a Tony Award.

214
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
And she was the, she played the stage manager in the movie Tootsie.

215
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Oh my God.

216
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
She's kind of, you know, she's an icon.

217
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
And such a nice, they're nice to us.

218
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Just always really warm to us.

219
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
She was lovely.

220
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
A lovely, and she was very generous.

221
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
She's a very lovely, generous person.

222
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
She was a joy spreader.

223
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:46,000
And I thought she just kind of up leveled the whole production.

224
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
She was probably the one real pro amongst us.

225
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
No offense, Greg.

226
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I totally agree.

227
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I was the act that was the way.

228
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Yeah.

229
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
This is Lynn Fitzpinn speaking for where in the world is Carmen Sandiego.

230
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
And remember, criminals are mean and greedy.

231
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
But act me good like Steve and Edie.

232
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:17,000
They hired us to do the next generation of Rockapella to do the where in the world is Carmen Sandiego planetarium show.

233
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
You remember that, Scott?

234
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
And we, it was like surround sound.

235
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It was supposed to be on a dome and a planetarium.

236
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
It was after this show it ended.

237
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
And I was so relieved to see that she was part of that.

238
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Because we felt, to me it seemed like a little bit adrift without her.

239
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
And there she was, comfortingly talking about planets and stars.

240
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:56,000
None of you guys have a Tony award like Lynn did.

241
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
But there was a lot of acting on this show.

242
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:05,000
From the outside looking in, it kind of felt like Scott and Barry that you guys were doing most of the acting.

243
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Barry, we'll start with you. Did you come from an acting background?

244
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I did, but let's make a distinction here between acting like Lynn did and shtick like we did.

245
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Well, I take offense at that.

246
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
What do you imply?

247
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
The fine art of shtick.

248
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I'm sorry, Scott.

249
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Before me, it wasn't, that's fine.

250
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Okay, I was deeply committed.

251
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Stanislavski method, really getting in there, really penetrating the character.

252
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
You know, I had a long, passionate relationship with Mrs. Pumpkin-Clanger.

253
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:51,000
The stench of crime lies heavy upon us, like a patient etherized upon a table.

254
00:19:51,000 --> 00:20:00,000
And alas, my downstairs neighbors are the clumsy surgeon entrusted with its cure.

255
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

256
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Can you still do the voice, Barry? Can you still do the Mrs. Pumpkin-Clanger voice?

257
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Griggy!

258
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
No, I guess not.

259
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:22,000
You know, the most interesting thing about that character was coming out of hair and makeup in my house dress and full drag,

260
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I had a bra and each cup was stuffed with two pairs of like thick athletic socks.

261
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,000
And even though the camera crew, everybody knew me, you know, it's like, it was me.

262
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,000
But there I was in, you know, a wig and makeup with these huge tits.

263
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
And the poor guys in the camera crew, they couldn't help looking at them.

264
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:54,000
And I was like, guys, guys, it sucks. It's me, it sucks.

265
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
You're not looking at what you think you're looking at, but I know you can't help it.

266
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
It's really funny.

267
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Scott, the Emmy for Best Dying Informant goes to you.

268
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I think we have a serious problem on our hands.

269
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Do you ever lose your voice from all that screaming?

270
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I basically scream for a living. I mean, if you've listened to the parts of rock and pellets.

271
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Yeah, I don't think I've ever, well, I've lost my voice funny. Yeah, sure.

272
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
But not from the dying informant.

273
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
With me, it wasn't really shtick. It was shtick because I was such a wooden actor.

274
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:06,000
But we did. But it was, I guess, everybody's dream to put on an Elvis outfit and do Elvis.

275
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
So that was actually really, really fun. That was one of my favorite moments of the whole show.

276
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:23,000
That and consistently, actually, the middle game was absolutely phenomenally crazy on the edge of a cliff fun.

277
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Aruba's fruit market.

278
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
No.

279
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Aruba's fruit market.

280
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I tensioned fruit market shoppers. Still no.

281
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Stampede.

282
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
That sounded like a real stampede.

283
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Trying to get the warrant and the loot and like trying to crack Greg up and like that whole thing was just crazy live TV.

284
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Your turn.

285
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Gillette tassel.

286
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Gillette tassel.

287
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Ow!

288
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Cut myself shaving, Greg.

289
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Get it?

290
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Why did you do that?

291
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Oh, I don't know.

292
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:21,000
By the end, they would make us show them the list we had made of the terms for the loot because they got a little blue or a little bit too pushy, too edgy for PBS.

293
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
So we would have to have Howard, the producer, come and look at our list say, okay, okay.

294
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
My favorite was when they had that statue in Belgium of a little guy that's urinating.

295
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Market piss.

296
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Market piss.

297
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
And we said, little us, we, we.

298
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
And there was also like, European.

299
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
They vetoed that one.

300
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
They vetoed European?

301
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Yeah, I was so disappointed.

302
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I thought, European, okay.

303
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
It was like, no.

304
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
That would be totally allowed nowadays.

305
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Bring on more pee.

306
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
We had the list of where everything was.

307
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:03,000
And when they were, when they said something, we would all go into this, like a sprinter's crouch.

308
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,000
You know, and we were, you, you would hear the breathing of the guy next to you to know when to come in.

309
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
It was, it was, it was athletic and very exciting.

310
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
The warrants.

311
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
The loot and the warrant.

312
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Do you remember where Sarah is?

313
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
The dinosaur's state park.

314
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Is she still at the dinosaur's state park?

315
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,000
That was like one of the most creative parts of the show is that we would actually get to write like five or six of them.

316
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
And we were so, so frustrating when the kid would get it quickly.

317
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
We didn't get to use this brilliant comedy, right?

318
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I think, I think we came up, I don't think we started with the loot.

319
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I think the loot came after they started censoring us.

320
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:02,000
And so when they censored us like with European and look at what those ones, then we would just be pissed and say, the loot.

321
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Yes.

322
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Jeff, when you, when you joined this group, I mean, what were your first thoughts?

323
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Cause I mean, these are some, some wild and zany people.

324
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Yeah.

325
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I had seen them on the Spike Lee special that they got Carmen from.

326
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:29,000
And for my audition, I had to interpret the sequence drum sounds from the soundtrack album to Carmen San Diego.

327
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
That was one of the things that Sean had me do in my hotel room audition.

328
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
So when I got there, it was, you know, it was a well oiled machine.

329
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:44,000
It was already in Queens in Kauffman Astoria Studios and Elliott would pick me up in his car service in the Upper West side of New York.

330
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
And we would, off we would go to this crazy thing that I'd never seen before.

331
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I'd worked in production staff for TV for a couple of years, but I had not been a part of something this colorful and seemingly freewheeling, I guess you could say.

332
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:06,000
And, and I, you know, that something that these guys have kind of alluded to, there was definitely a little bit of a rebellious vibe.

333
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
There was a creative versus structure kind of thing going on.

334
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:17,000
That was really interesting to watch because that kind of sense of rebellion is kind of what Rockefeller is in many ways in my interpretation.

335
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I've seen that a lot and it's, and it's something that is hilarious.

336
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
What's going to happen is Greg's going to come out and Scott's pants are down.

337
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
And Greg's going to cry.

338
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
The right one.

339
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Yes!

340
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Go Dino, go, go, uh, word.

341
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Let's see if I can look from there.

342
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Oh, there you go.

343
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Well, I have to use that one. I'm locking it.

344
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
That's a good one. You can use that?

345
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Yeah, I'm supposed to do it.

346
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
There's a fine shit of, what do you call those things again?

347
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Fiber optic sparklers.

348
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I knew how a TV show was made, but I had not seen that level of creativity in action like moment to moment.

349
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
It was really interesting.

350
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
There was a lot of moving parts to this show.

351
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Greg, what was the most challenging part of your job?

352
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Well, I mean, I make jokes about it, but I really did.

353
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
It was hard for me to read those cards.

354
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I mean, some of those names are very hard for me.

355
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I'm a fairly dyslexic person, and I mean, seriously dyslexic.

356
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
And so some of those were like, you got me kidding me, man.

357
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I couldn't even pronounce them. I read them.

358
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Okay, guys, name the city, if you will, please.

359
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Is it Bratislava, Gdansk, or Odessa?

360
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Remember the clues that we heard on the Danube River?

361
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
The answer we're looking for is Panampen.

362
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Nice job, guys.

363
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Kunming, Hong Kong, or Taipei?

364
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Remember the clues that we heard.

365
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Thanks a lot.

366
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
If there was ever any pressure about it,

367
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
that for me was always the hardest part,

368
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
to just be rolling and then have a Herzegovina sitting there.

369
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I have no idea what that's like.

370
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
What in the world is that?

371
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
So that was always the hardest part for me.

372
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
The rest of it was fairly, you know, when you could move and do things,

373
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
it was fairly just enjoyable.

374
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
It was just fun, you know.

375
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
And of course, the map was the most fun,

376
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
just because that's the time that I felt like I was the kid's teammate.

377
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
So you just really wanted me to get there.

378
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Do you think your geography skills got better through the years?

379
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Possibly.

380
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I mean, they were okay before, I guess.

381
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I remember the, I don't know if you guys remember this,

382
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
but I think it was at the very first show.

383
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
It was early on, I remember that the Soviet Union broke up

384
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
right before we went to Tape one night.

385
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Do you guys remember this?

386
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Yes.

387
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
They changed all the maps like the night before.

388
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
The lyrics.

389
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Check in Slovakia.

390
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Yeah.

391
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
So everything had changed like the night before.

392
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,000
So they'd been up all night changing the big map that we're going to use that day.

393
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,000
That story has an ending somewhere, but I don't have it right now.

394
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Can we, while I have everybody here,

395
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
and I want to kind of set the record straight,

396
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
because Barry before we went on told me a story, Greg,

397
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
about this unique accident that happened on set between the two of you.

398
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Do you remember that, Greg?

399
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Who was it?

400
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
What was the, who was it?

401
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Between you and Barry, an accident happened.

402
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
To me, Barry?

403
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Barry knows it.

404
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Barry, you know it?

405
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
It sounds like an unplanned pregnancy.

406
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
The 10 ton weight?

407
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
10 ton weight?

408
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
No, no.

409
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
No, but as you remember,

410
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
actually we were rehearsing one of the big baby scenes.

411
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Yeah.

412
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
And I was making a lot of noise.

413
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I was probably crying.

414
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:50,000
And you silenced me by shoving a big binky in my mouth.

415
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Yeah.

416
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I don't know what got into you that day,

417
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
but it just slugged me in the mouth.

418
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I had this big, huge, fat lip.

419
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Oh my gosh.

420
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I was like, I have no memory of that.

421
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Well, my mouth remembers.

422
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I'm so sorry.

423
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Wow, that must be...

424
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Well, Greg, you apologized at the time.

425
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
There was no hard feelings.

426
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I just remember that enormous binky, you know, slamming into my mouth.

427
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
It's been years of therapy.

428
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
You know, we're good.

429
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I do remember hitting the shower with a snowball

430
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
when we had that big run around.

431
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Yeah, that's one of the ones that's on YouTube.

432
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Now, we have just heard that Nimoy has left Conakry.

433
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
So let's pick up the chase.

434
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
The chase.

435
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Quite enough of this, mister.

436
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
It's on you right now.

437
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
No, no, no.

438
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
No, no, no, no.

439
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Thank you.

440
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
My daughter loves that one, but it was good.

441
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
And when I watched that, my main impression is,

442
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
wow, I could run.

443
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Because now it gets better.

444
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
But that was good.

445
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
And also, you know, I remember it's like,

446
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
some of the stuff we did was, I wouldn't call it athletic,

447
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
the four or the five of us crammed into the doorway

448
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
to sing to Greg, sing some of those clues.

449
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I don't know how we did that because we were all,

450
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
three of us, two of us must have been on our knees

451
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
and we were all just kind of squished in there.

452
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
That pizza robot, yeah.

453
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Whoa, that pizza robot.

454
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Bring back, bring back that pizza robot

455
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
because we're getting lonely for some pepperoni.

456
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
We remember banks, banks, banks.

457
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
We had this, where we had to sing the three of us.

458
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
That was good.

459
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Four of us were like singing some background thing

460
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
and our lyric was banks, banks, banks.

461
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
And we, like before the skit, we said,

462
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
okay, on banks, banks, banks, we're all going to jump,

463
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
hop on each banks.

464
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
And of course, so like, we all got together except for Sean

465
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
and said like, let's not do it.

466
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
So Sean's is hopping banks, banks, banks, and we're not.

467
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Oh my God, it's great.

468
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Whoa.

469
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Banks, banks, banks, banks, banks, banks.

470
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Whoa.

471
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Hey, hey, I think we got the point.

472
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Thank you.

473
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I think we got the final taped episode of Carmen.

474
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Sean cut off, or Greg dressed as the barber.

475
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
You cut off Sean's iconic braids,

476
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
but is it true that nobody else knew what was going to happen?

477
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Thank you for calling the braids iconic.

478
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I look back at them with the mixture of embarrassment and.

479
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
That was the 90s spent a lot of money on this.

480
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I remember that the only people that knew was going to happen

481
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
were Greg and I guess the director and one of the producers.

482
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I think maybe I was done with wearing an 80s haircut in the 90s.

483
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Ask, have I been swigging too much from the flask?

484
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Why cut my braids?

485
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:47,000
You wonder, I've been Schmoderich and Stevie Blunder.

486
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
It's been 10 years.

487
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Yes.

488
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Count them.

489
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
A 12 on Twitter.

490
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
American dollars.

491
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I just found almost all of those braids.

492
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I'm going to try to sell them.

493
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?

494
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Tell me.

495
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?

496
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Tell me.

497
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?

498
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
This has been for where in the world is Carmen Sandiego.

499
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
And remember, the Acme Triangle of Excellence.

500
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Vigilance, dedication, courage.

501
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?

502
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?

503
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?

504
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,000
All geographic information was accurate as of the date this program was recorded.

505
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?

506
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?

507
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?

508
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?

509
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
It's on the back.

510
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
It's on the back, y'all.

511
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Look at that.

512
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
That's what I call a buzz cut.

513
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Awesome.

514
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
We're really cooking.

515
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Including all the hair gentlemen, I mean, I truly loved where in the world is Carmen Sandiego.

516
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Every element.

517
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Greg, Rockefeller.

518
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
So the big question is, why do you change a show?

519
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Why do you make a show where in time is Carmen Sandiego?

520
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
When the show was already such a huge hit.

521
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Tell me where in time is Carmen Sandiego?

522
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I remember somebody, somebody in power telling me it's easier to get funding for a new show

523
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
than to get an existing show refunded.

524
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Wow.

525
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I don't know how that works.

526
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
It was disappointing.

527
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I mean, especially in retrospect, when you realize now how valuable to a career being on television is.

528
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:03,000
At the time, maybe, I can't speak for everyone else, but at the time, you know, I remember thinking,

529
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:09,000
oh, you know, we'll get on another TV show or some other amazing thing will happen.

530
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
But, you know, these things don't happen very often.

531
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:18,000
And to be on television every day is, wow, that's a powerful thing for a career.

532
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:24,000
That sound means it is time for the lightning round, just like on Carmen Sandiego.

533
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
You're on host home.

534
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
We also have a round.

535
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Are you guys up for a challenge?

536
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Yes, sir.

537
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Scott says reluctantly.

538
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Yes, sir.

539
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Here's what's going to happen.

540
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Let's see how well you know your Carmen Sandiego crooks.

541
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I'm going to go to each of you.

542
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I'm going to ask you to name a crook.

543
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
We're going to keep going until we have one winner.

544
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Name any Carmen Sandiego crook.

545
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Jeff, we're going to start with you.

546
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
It's a brute.

547
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Elias.

548
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Nick the slick.

549
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Barry.

550
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I lose.

551
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Greg.

552
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Eddie Larisony.

553
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Scott.

554
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Top Grunge.

555
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
John.

556
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Ni ni ni ni ni ni moi.

557
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Ni ni ni ni ni moi.

558
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
That was great, by the way.

559
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
That was great.

560
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Back over to you, Jeff.

561
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Oh, God, what's left?

562
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Those two guys, the twins.

563
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Double trouble.

564
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Yes, double trouble.

565
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Elias.

566
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
That was the last one I could remember was double trouble.

567
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
You have five left.

568
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Oh my God.

569
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Five left?

570
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
There's five left.

571
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Hint, hint, hint.

572
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
I got a line.

573
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Three seconds.

574
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
No idea.

575
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
All right, there's Scott.

576
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
There's four more left.

577
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
I got nothing.

578
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
All right.

579
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I'll give you guys a hint.

580
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Oh.

581
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Robo crook.

582
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Robo crook.

583
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
And the Contessa.

584
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Contessa.

585
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
And Nana rap, but people didn't realize that.

586
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
She was very diverse.

587
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
She was.

588
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
She had suffered a lot.

589
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
She's no good.

590
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Nana.

591
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
You got the Nana.

592
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Nana.

593
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
By the way, the two that nobody named just so we can put everybody

594
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
out of their misery was Sarah Nade.

595
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Oh yeah.

596
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Sarah Nade.

597
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Okay, that was the rock one.

598
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Yeah.

599
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
And then nobody, nobody names Carmen San Diego.

600
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Oh.

601
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Well, we want to talk about that.

602
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
We want to talk about that.

603
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
We want to talk about what everybody's doing now.

604
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Scott,

605
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
you have been in rock appella coming up on 30 years and you're

606
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
still making great music with rock appella.

607
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
But you hear that statistic that Scott Leonard has been with

608
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
rock appella for 30 years.

609
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Does it surprise you?

610
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Yeah, it's kind of,

611
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
I don't,

612
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
it doesn't really mean anything to me.

613
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
I'm like,

614
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
it may after day just get up and do it again and then it just

615
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
accumulates like that.

616
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
I guess.

617
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Crazy.

618
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
I can't believe it's been 30 years since we did Carmen San

619
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Diego.

620
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
I mean,

621
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
that's another life.

622
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Yeah.

623
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
And Jeff,

624
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
you're also still with rock appella.

625
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Can you tell us what the group is up to nowadays?

626
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Well,

627
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
we never stopped making stuff.

628
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,000
And we've had a lot of albums and,

629
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
you know,

630
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
folders,

631
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
coffee commercials and all kinds of things like that.

632
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
So, you know,

633
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
if that sound is something that you enjoy,

634
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
please come and check us out.

635
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Elliot,

636
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
you left rock appella in 2004 and I'm really jealous of you

637
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:12,000
because you work on my wife and my absolute like favorite TV

638
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
show,

639
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
besides Carmen,

640
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
of course,

641
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
can you tell us about that?

642
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Um,

643
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
I guess you're talking about the marvelous Mrs.

644
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Maisel.

645
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Yeah.

646
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
But,

647
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
um,

648
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
so I work on my,

649
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
I built a business over the years.

650
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Consulting on,

651
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:32,000
and submitting tax incentive applications for many,

652
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
many,

653
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
many TV shows and films in New York.

654
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Um,

655
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
so I work for big studios.

656
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Um,

657
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
and one of them is one of the,

658
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
one of my shows is the marvelous Mrs.

659
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Maisel.

660
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Wow.

661
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
It's a fantastic show.

662
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
How about you, Barry?

663
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Oh,

664
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
how about you?

665
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
What are you up to?

666
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Well,

667
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
you know,

668
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I left a great deal of work.

669
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Um,

670
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
and my,

671
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
my primary incentive was my kids were growing up without me.

672
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Um,

673
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
so I spent a good amount of time kind of having a relationship with

674
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
my kids,

675
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
which went by really fast, you know,

676
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
because then college happened and out of the house.

677
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Um,

678
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
I retrained as a, as a, um,

679
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
therapist.

680
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
And,

681
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
um,

682
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
I've been doing that for,

683
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
gosh,

684
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
15 years.

685
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Uh,

686
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
but I,

687
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I still get to do music and I have,

688
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I,

689
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I've been doing voiceovers for

690
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
since 1983.

691
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
I think.

692
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Um,

693
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
so I'm still basically doing everything that I was doing,

694
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
except singing with the guys and,

695
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
and traveling.

696
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Um,

697
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
so I'm still basically doing everything that I was doing,

698
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
singing with the guys and,

699
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
and traveling.

700
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
And of course we have to mention this.

701
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
How could we forget?

702
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
You were the announcer of the game show.

703
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
You would have.

704
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I was.

705
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
That's right.

706
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Oh,

707
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
these people want to know.

708
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
They're in the world.

709
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:13,000
It's

710
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
a travel guide collection.

711
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Meet Adam Herbie.

712
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
She's been to Spain and Columbia.

713
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
He likes martial arts.

714
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Meet Stephanie Donozo.

715
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
We all wear a lot of hats.

716
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Literally.

717
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Literally.

718
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Like Elliot,

719
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
literally wear a lot of hats.

720
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Sean,

721
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
you always wear a lot of hats.

722
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
And now you have this incredible duo,

723
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
the Everly set.

724
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Wake up,

725
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
little Susie.

726
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Wake up.

727
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Never felt like this until I kissed you.

728
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Love hurts,

729
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
love scars.

730
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
I'm in a,

731
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
I'm in a

732
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Everly brothers tribute act.

733
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
I've become one of the,

734
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
you know,

735
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
when I was,

736
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
when I was focused on writing original music,

737
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
I used to laugh at tribute acts.

738
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
And now I've become,

739
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
that's what I do now.

740
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
And finally,

741
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
because the show is called hosts at home,

742
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
with the most Greg Lee,

743
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
in very sunny Santa Monica, California.

744
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
What are you up to nowadays?

745
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Mostly I just do a lot of voiceover like Barry.

746
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
And,

747
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
and then we do a lot of writing.

748
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Pitch and I just did a show for Audible for

749
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Highlights magazine.

750
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
We did a bunch of kit stuff for them.

751
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
So we still do a lot of that stuff.

752
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Well guys,

753
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
this has been truly phenomenal to reunite

754
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
the cast of where in the world is Carmen San Diego.

755
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Did you guys have fun?

756
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Yes, I did.

757
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Yes.

758
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Yes, I did.

759
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
It's great.

760
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
It's great to see you guys.

761
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Very great to see you.

762
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
It's key.

763
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
You got to count it off, Sean.

764
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
You got to give it a shot.

765
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Is that it?

766
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
That's it.

767
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Wow.

768
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
That's so high.

769
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Oh my God.

770
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Cut.

771
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Let's take it down.

772
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Let's take it,

773
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
let's take it down a whole step.

774
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Hey, hey.

775
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Oh God.

776
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
I'm really going to try to do it.

777
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
It'll never,

778
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
it'll never sync up.

779
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Right.

780
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Warning.

781
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
What you're about to see is living proof

782
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
that live music does not work over Zoom.

783
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
One, two, three.

784
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Hoop.

785
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Hoop.

786
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Hoop.

787
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Hoop.

788
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Hoop.

789
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Hoop.

790
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Hoop.

791
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Hoop.

792
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Hoop.

793
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Hoop.

794
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Hoop.

795
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Hoop.

796
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Hoop.

797
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Hoop.

798
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Hoop.

799
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Hoop.

800
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Hoop.

801
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Hoop.

802
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Hoop.

803
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
You guys are amazing.

804
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Thank you all so much

805
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
for being with us here on Host at Home.

806
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Thank you, Adam.

807
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Like every episode.

808
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Thank you, Adam.

809
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Thank you guys.

810
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Like every episode,

811
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
I don't close the show.

812
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
We're going to go to the host of Where in the World

813
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
is Carmen Cinego,

814
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
senior agent in charge of training new recruits.

815
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Craig Lee,

816
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
over to you.

817
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Thanks, Adam.

818
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
This has been a true blast.

819
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Thanks to the boys for showing up.

820
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Thanks to all of you for showing up.

821
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Please be sure to join us again for Host at Home.

822
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Until then,

823
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
do it, Rockapella.

824
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:57,000
All geographic information was accurate

825
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
from the date this reunion was recorded.

826
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Where in the world is Carmen Cinego?
