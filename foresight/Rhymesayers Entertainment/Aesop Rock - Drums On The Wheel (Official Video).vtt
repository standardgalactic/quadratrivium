00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Calling Gamma Ray.

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
This is Major Cigar.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
Do you read me, Gamma Ray?

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Gamma Ray, Gamma, come in!

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
Gamma Ray, please respond!

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
Well, his brain is fried.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
Pack it up, mission's over.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
Do you read me? Do you read me?

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
Do I need to reach through the TV?

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
Do I need to reach through the Weegee?

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
Houston and Meg, I'm too deeny.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
I'm too uneasy, I'm out of face, and I'm orange-tanging.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
I'm powdered eggs, and my radio's been down for days.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
So just stand around and shout out the phrase and go,

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
Do you read me? Shook up, shoot a beanie.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
I'll look for the Moga Fitti.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
Deep into some hellhole, come detect this tempo.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
I've been feeding back in these headphones,

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
beating back a profound fear.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
Farewell to my breadcrumbs.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
Is anybody even out there? Am I out there in that truth?

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
Tweety, that new piece, do you read me?

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
You don't read me, I'm barely a thing.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
I'm scared to blink, I might shrink some and I shrink more.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Trink past this pink dwarf.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
No sign of my bull star, but I'll up here,

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
but don't mean north.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Deep space and no G4, some more tumble out.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
Some death bells, some bleep bleep,

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
robot voice, some red light, some scent and help.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Straighten me to some ET to come deep-frying.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
I'll reap, raise, and re-haul.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Reach out, reap what he sow.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
Jesus, do you read me? We don't.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
We don't. We don't. We don't.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
We don't. We don't. We don't.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
We don't. We don't. We don't.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
We.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
Do you read me camera?

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
And I play drums on the wheel

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
where the feeling out of touch

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
are outgunned in the feels.

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
Drums on the wheel,

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
bomb sites in blackouts

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
and foglights and gas clouds

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
jockey through vacuums

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
None of our flaps down, it's shocking.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Shout out, this one small part is

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
Ain't once chosen to abort shit that we've honed in on our problem

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
Not stop until you stop and see what kind of quad you're in, you got lost in

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
Do you read me that option, and y'all's options are exhausted

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
Been dropped off in this mosh pit instead of locked in at one orbit

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
Knock knock, fullback of this cockpit, it's my coffin

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
Bust levels, I'm doomed to repeat, nuke dance, cold do you read me

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
It involves a beyond the under mantra, once none ping in my transponder

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
Once you up a copy, y'all blame the cops, you been handed back to y'all

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
Unresponsive, ten hut and I'm in sync, thrown home but just ring and ring

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
Asteroids that leave marks in black holes that eat stars

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
Green cheese and GPS be decked with feed tours

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
Fuel gauge round the street, my beacons are all blanked out

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
I might slink up in a junk heap, you can't read and or pin down

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
Gamma Ray, come in!

02:47.000 --> 02:53.000
And I play drums on the wheel, where the feeling out of touch are outgunned in the fields

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
Drums on the wheel

03:00.000 --> 03:06.000
And I play drums on the wheel, where the feeling out of touch are outgunned in the fields

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
Drums on the wheel

03:17.000 --> 03:24.000
And I play drums on the wheel, where the feeling out of touch are outgunned in the fields

03:24.000 --> 03:33.000
And I play drums on the wheel, where the feeling out of touch are outgunned in the fields
