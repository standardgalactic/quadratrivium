0	2000	Calling Gamma Ray.
4000	6000	This is Major Cigar.
7000	9000	Do you read me, Gamma Ray?
14000	16000	Gamma Ray, Gamma, come in!
18000	20000	Gamma Ray, please respond!
21000	23000	Well, his brain is fried.
23000	25000	Pack it up, mission's over.
25000	27000	Do you read me? Do you read me?
27000	29000	Do I need to reach through the TV?
29000	31000	Do I need to reach through the Weegee?
31000	33000	Houston and Meg, I'm too deeny.
33000	35000	I'm too uneasy, I'm out of face, and I'm orange-tanging.
35000	37000	I'm powdered eggs, and my radio's been down for days.
37000	39000	So just stand around and shout out the phrase and go,
39000	41000	Do you read me? Shook up, shoot a beanie.
41000	43000	I'll look for the Moga Fitti.
43000	45000	Deep into some hellhole, come detect this tempo.
45000	47000	I've been feeding back in these headphones,
47000	49000	beating back a profound fear.
49000	51000	Farewell to my breadcrumbs.
51000	53000	Is anybody even out there? Am I out there in that truth?
53000	55000	Tweety, that new piece, do you read me?
55000	57000	You don't read me, I'm barely a thing.
57000	59000	I'm scared to blink, I might shrink some and I shrink more.
59000	61000	Trink past this pink dwarf.
61000	63000	No sign of my bull star, but I'll up here,
63000	64000	but don't mean north.
64000	66000	Deep space and no G4, some more tumble out.
66000	68000	Some death bells, some bleep bleep,
68000	70000	robot voice, some red light, some scent and help.
70000	72000	Straighten me to some ET to come deep-frying.
72000	74000	I'll reap, raise, and re-haul.
74000	75000	Reach out, reap what he sow.
75000	77000	Jesus, do you read me? We don't.
77000	79000	We don't. We don't. We don't.
79000	81000	We don't. We don't. We don't.
81000	83000	We don't. We don't. We don't.
83000	85000	We.
88000	91000	Do you read me camera?
91000	93000	And I play drums on the wheel
93000	95000	where the feeling out of touch
95000	99000	are outgunned in the feels.
99000	103000	Drums on the wheel,
103000	105000	bomb sites in blackouts
105000	107000	and foglights and gas clouds
107000	108000	jockey through vacuums
108000	110000	None of our flaps down, it's shocking.
110000	112000	Shout out, this one small part is
112000	115000	Ain't once chosen to abort shit that we've honed in on our problem
115000	118000	Not stop until you stop and see what kind of quad you're in, you got lost in
118000	121000	Do you read me that option, and y'all's options are exhausted
121000	124000	Been dropped off in this mosh pit instead of locked in at one orbit
124000	128000	Knock knock, fullback of this cockpit, it's my coffin
128000	131000	Bust levels, I'm doomed to repeat, nuke dance, cold do you read me
131000	134000	It involves a beyond the under mantra, once none ping in my transponder
134000	137000	Once you up a copy, y'all blame the cops, you been handed back to y'all
137000	141000	Unresponsive, ten hut and I'm in sync, thrown home but just ring and ring
141000	144000	Asteroids that leave marks in black holes that eat stars
144000	147000	Green cheese and GPS be decked with feed tours
147000	150000	Fuel gauge round the street, my beacons are all blanked out
150000	154000	I might slink up in a junk heap, you can't read and or pin down
165000	167000	Gamma Ray, come in!
167000	173000	And I play drums on the wheel, where the feeling out of touch are outgunned in the fields
175000	177000	Drums on the wheel
180000	186000	And I play drums on the wheel, where the feeling out of touch are outgunned in the fields
188000	190000	Drums on the wheel
197000	204000	And I play drums on the wheel, where the feeling out of touch are outgunned in the fields
204000	213000	And I play drums on the wheel, where the feeling out of touch are outgunned in the fields
