 The text you've provided appears to be a lyrically complex and abstract piece, possibly inspired by space exploration themes. It references various elements associated with deep space communication, such as "Gamma Ray," which could be a code name for a spacecraft or a crew member, and "Major Cigar," a character that seems to be experiencing difficulties in communication or disorientation.

Key points and themes in the text include:

1. **Communication Failures**: The protagonist (likely Major Cigar) is trying to establish contact with "Gamma Ray" but is struggling due to technical issues ("Pack it up, mission's over. My radio’s been down for days").

2. **Isolation and Fear**: The protagonist feels disconnected ("I've been feeding back in these headphones, beating back a profound fear") and uncertain about their surroundings ("Deep space and no G4").

3. **Existential Questions**: The protagonist contemplates their own existence and the nature of reality ("Am I out there in that truth?").

4. **Technical Malfunctions**: There are issues with equipment ("my radio’s been down for days," "some more tumble out").

5. **A Desperate Plea**: The protagonist is reaching out to any entity that might be listening, including a potential extraterrestrial being ("Straighten me to some ET to come deep-frying").

6. **Reiteration of Failure**: A sense of repeated failure and hopelessness is expressed multiple times ("We don't. We don't.").

7. **Attempts at Communication**: The protagonist attempts to communicate through various means, including visual ("Do you read me camera?") and auditory signals (playing drums on the wheel).

8. **Navigating Uncertainty**: The protagonist is navigating through a situation where they are lost or off-course ("None of our flaps down, it's shocking").

9. **Resilience and Determination**: Despite the odds and difficulties, the protagonist remains determined to continue attempting to communicate and resolve their situation ("Ain't once chosen to abort shit that we've honed in on our problem").

10. **References to Space and Technology**: The text includes references to space terminology like "bomb sites," "blackouts," "foglights," "gas clouds," and "vacuums," which evoke a sense of being adrift in the cosmos.

11. **Metaphysical and Spiritual Elements**: There are allusions to higher powers or entities ("Beyond the under mantra"), and a sense of being out of sync with one's surroundings ("Knock knock, fullback of this cockpit, it's my coffin").

The overall tone is one of isolation, technological challenges, and a search for connection in an environment where communication is difficult or impossible. The repetition of "Do you read me?" emphasizes the protagonist's attempts to establish contact and their growing sense of desperation as they continue to remain unheard.
