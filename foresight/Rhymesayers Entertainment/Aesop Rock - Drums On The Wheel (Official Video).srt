1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Calling Gamma Ray.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
This is Major Cigar.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Do you read me, Gamma Ray?

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Gamma Ray, Gamma, come in!

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Gamma Ray, please respond!

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Well, his brain is fried.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Pack it up, mission's over.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Do you read me? Do you read me?

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Do I need to reach through the TV?

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Do I need to reach through the Weegee?

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Houston and Meg, I'm too deeny.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm too uneasy, I'm out of face, and I'm orange-tanging.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm powdered eggs, and my radio's been down for days.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So just stand around and shout out the phrase and go,

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Do you read me? Shook up, shoot a beanie.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'll look for the Moga Fitti.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Deep into some hellhole, come detect this tempo.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I've been feeding back in these headphones,

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
beating back a profound fear.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Farewell to my breadcrumbs.

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Is anybody even out there? Am I out there in that truth?

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Tweety, that new piece, do you read me?

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You don't read me, I'm barely a thing.

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm scared to blink, I might shrink some and I shrink more.

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Trink past this pink dwarf.

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
No sign of my bull star, but I'll up here,

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
but don't mean north.

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Deep space and no G4, some more tumble out.

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Some death bells, some bleep bleep,

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
robot voice, some red light, some scent and help.

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Straighten me to some ET to come deep-frying.

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'll reap, raise, and re-haul.

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Reach out, reap what he sow.

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Jesus, do you read me? We don't.

35
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
We don't. We don't. We don't.

36
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
We don't. We don't. We don't.

37
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
We don't. We don't. We don't.

38
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
We.

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Do you read me camera?

40
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And I play drums on the wheel

41
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
where the feeling out of touch

42
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
are outgunned in the feels.

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Drums on the wheel,

44
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
bomb sites in blackouts

45
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
and foglights and gas clouds

46
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
jockey through vacuums

47
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
None of our flaps down, it's shocking.

48
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Shout out, this one small part is

49
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Ain't once chosen to abort shit that we've honed in on our problem

50
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Not stop until you stop and see what kind of quad you're in, you got lost in

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Do you read me that option, and y'all's options are exhausted

52
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Been dropped off in this mosh pit instead of locked in at one orbit

53
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Knock knock, fullback of this cockpit, it's my coffin

54
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Bust levels, I'm doomed to repeat, nuke dance, cold do you read me

55
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It involves a beyond the under mantra, once none ping in my transponder

56
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Once you up a copy, y'all blame the cops, you been handed back to y'all

57
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Unresponsive, ten hut and I'm in sync, thrown home but just ring and ring

58
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Asteroids that leave marks in black holes that eat stars

59
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Green cheese and GPS be decked with feed tours

60
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Fuel gauge round the street, my beacons are all blanked out

61
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I might slink up in a junk heap, you can't read and or pin down

62
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Gamma Ray, come in!

63
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And I play drums on the wheel, where the feeling out of touch are outgunned in the fields

64
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Drums on the wheel

65
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And I play drums on the wheel, where the feeling out of touch are outgunned in the fields

66
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Drums on the wheel

67
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And I play drums on the wheel, where the feeling out of touch are outgunned in the fields

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And I play drums on the wheel, where the feeling out of touch are outgunned in the fields
