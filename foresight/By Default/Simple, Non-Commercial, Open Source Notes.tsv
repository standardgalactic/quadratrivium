0	3240	Last year, I finally decided I need a Notion replacement.
3240	7520	I was sick of big tech stealing my data, their employees stealing my nudes, and feeding my
7520	11960	high quality, high value personal notes and documents to sell to advertisers or train
11960	12960	large language models.
12960	16120	They're all doing it, I don't care what their privacy policy says, one day they're
16120	20320	just gonna update it and it's, oh yeah, your data is yours, except psych, we're creating
20320	24400	personally identified consumer profiles of your internet activity, GPS data, and selling
24400	25760	it to advertisers.
25760	29160	And yes, even though you didn't upload them, Notion has your nudes, I don't make the
29160	30160	rules.
30160	34000	So before I waste your time, I need a Notion replacement for a personal wiki notes, to-dos
34000	37360	and documents, not the 400 other things that Notion tries to be.
37360	42000	So I needed a program that is free, non-commercial open source.
42000	46000	This is philosophical, and most people don't care, so this might not be the right video
46000	47000	for you.
47000	51280	I don't want development to be beholden to venture capital, prioritize monetizing a
51280	56520	cloud service, or, underrated reason, build on pointless checkbox features for the sake
56520	58600	of marketplace differentiation.
58600	62880	So if it's run by a business or has a pricing tab on the website, even if it's totally
62880	65600	free for personal use, it's probably not for me.
65600	70160	Like LogSeq is funded by $4 million in venture capital, cool, get that bag.
70160	74120	I just need to turn my text files into slightly more organized text files.
74120	78040	I think this is a problem that can be solved without incorporating a business to extract
78040	79880	value from the solution.
79880	81400	Local and self-hosted.
81400	84480	Privacy and data ownership is the biggest reason I needed to get off Notion, so there's
84480	88580	no sense in just giving my data over to another cloud service, no matter how private it currently
88580	89720	claims to be.
89720	91480	Storing notes as plain text.
91480	93320	I want zero vendor lock-in.
93320	97720	I want to sync my notes using whatever program I want, I want to use my own version control,
97720	102760	I want to be able to view my files on everything from a Commodore 64 to an Amazon Kindle without
102760	104480	worrying about client software.
104480	108380	When my new software inevitably dies, I just want to dump my notes folder into whatever
108380	109920	the new thing I'm using is.
109920	110920	And fast.
110920	113680	Notion is the slowest note-taking software I have ever used.
113680	116900	And while I said this bit, I was going to put in a little clip of me clicking a link
116920	119280	and it taking two seconds for the page to load.
119280	124040	But instead for dramatic effect, I went to click a database view and the page took 24
124040	125760	seconds to load.
125760	126760	Notion is garbage!
126760	131760	Alright, and some nice-to-haves, simple, I don't need a second brain, or dear god,
131760	138680	a life-operating system with databases, kanban charts, whatever endless features.
138680	141960	I just need to store notes, scripts, recipes, travel plans, whatever.
141960	145520	A bright future throwing this out there because Dendron suddenly ceased development in the
145520	147260	middle of my search.
147260	148260	Encrypted notes.
148260	151260	A lot of these projects are just like, oh, encrypt your entire hard drive, we're not
151260	152260	an encryption project.
152260	156340	Well, guess what, I do encrypt my hard drives, but I do this really weird thing called decrypting
156340	158100	them when I'm using my computer.
158100	161860	And I also sync and back up my notes to all sorts of devices.
161860	166140	Which yes, should be encrypted, but it's still nice to know if I accidentally sync or back
166140	169940	up my notes somewhere that's not encrypted that personal info and account numbers and
169940	172180	stuff would still be encrypted within my notes.
172180	175300	Alright, let's quickly run down everything that didn't make the cut so you don't think
175300	178560	I forgot about your favorite note app because you're just watching this video to see if
178560	181400	some guy on YouTube ended up using the same thing as you.
181400	186000	Leave a thumbs down when I get to your favorite proprietary or commercial software, Obsidian,
186000	191240	OneNote, Evernote, Rome, LogSeek, Taipora, BoostNote, StandardNote, SimpleNote, Notable
191240	196040	used to be open source, isn't anymore, mem.ai, NotesNook, and Google Keep.
196040	200760	Programs that don't store notes in plain text are CherryTree, Laverna, Tomboy, NG,
200760	205280	TiddlyWiki, I used to use that in college, TiddlyRome had no idea that existed, but that's
205280	206180	cool as hell.
206180	210420	And finally, Joplin and Trillium, which look like two nice options if you don't care
210420	212540	that notes are just stored in a SQLite database.
212540	216460	I did consider all of these though, and the case in point is Dendrin, which wouldn't
216460	221060	have made my cut anyway, but I loved how Dendrin stores notes via hierarchically organized
221060	223060	filenames in a flat directory.
223060	227300	This was my favorite method of any program I considered, and I adopted a similar system
227300	228300	myself.
228300	231580	Now, you may have noticed I just threw out almost every note app you ever considered
231880	236840	because yeah, the non-commercial open source plain text notes software scene is a little
236840	237840	bit niche.
237840	241600	I ended up with four programs that I really like that probably suit different people.
241600	244880	In the end, I don't think it matters what you use as long as you stick with it and use
244880	248960	it to the full potential, and get off the productivity treadmill that you're currently
248960	251360	on because it's a disaster, I promise.
251360	254800	Before that, real quick, ThreeRunnersUp did meet all of my criteria.
254800	258440	Zettler is a markdown editor with a really fancy editing window.
258440	263100	It's got these gooey tables which save as plain text, and yes, that is very fancy.
263100	266820	It has this little hidden folding bar on the left side of the editing window as you can
266820	269860	see everything, resizes and recolors itself.
269860	271700	It is a very beautiful program.
271700	275900	The only minor issue I even have with it is that sometimes it feels a little bit too fancy.
275900	279340	You've got this little window that pops up whenever you select text, and sometimes when
279340	283020	you try to select something, the text window just tries to guess what you're trying to
283020	284980	select rather than go where the cursor is.
284980	287220	I have no idea why programs ever do this.
287220	290800	You also have to control click links just because it's primarily an editing window.
290800	296000	But super minor nitpicks aside, if you were looking for like full-featured desktop software,
296000	299040	Zettler is by far the most beautiful program on the list.
299040	303560	There's also VNote, which wow, 10,000 stars on GitHub and I have never heard of this come
303560	305120	up anywhere once.
305120	308680	Maybe there's some cool feature, but this really just seems worse than Zettler to me.
308680	313280	This is also a markdown editor, and it has a toggle between editing mode and read mode.
313280	316600	Except on two separate computers, I couldn't get the read mode to work, and you can't
316620	320220	follow links from within edit mode, which kind of made it unusable.
320220	324340	I mean, this is Linux, so it's probably my fault for being a dumb user, but I'm just
324340	325740	saying my experience here.
325740	327980	And then there's also NB if you're a nerd.
327980	332300	This is a single bash script that runs from the terminal and organizes notes for you.
332300	335220	You can open and edit the notes in whatever text editor you want.
335220	340260	It even has fancy features like linked notes, encrypted notes, inserting images into notebooks.
340260	343980	The only reason it's not for me is because I can just use plugins from within a text
344000	348640	editor to do pretty much all of this, rather than having to run a separate script alongside
348640	349640	it.
349640	350640	Alright.
350640	351640	Zim.
351640	353400	Now we're getting to the really excellent stuff.
353400	357520	Zim is as simple as it gets, a hierarchical list of notes.
357520	361520	The editor doesn't support markdown, but instead it has a very snappy, rich text editor
361520	366720	where you use shortcuts like Ctrl 123 to make headings, or Ctrl I to italicize.
366720	370140	Attachments and pictures just drag into the editor like you'd expect.
370140	373920	The files themselves are stored as legible plain text, but it does have its own weird
373920	377600	syntax, and attachments and images are stored in a separate folder.
377600	382520	In Zim, each note is a parent node to the notes underneath it, meaning the notes organize
382520	386920	themselves hierarchically rather than having a folder structure on top of it.
386920	389560	Basically, each folder is also a note.
389560	394360	This is similar to Notion or Dendron, and I personally love it, but most apps seem to
394360	399440	use the folder or graph paradigms rather than just pure hierarchical notes for some reason.
399440	404180	It's also got all the features you might want, like tags, tables, task lists, journals,
404180	408420	encrypted notes, but by default it doesn't burden you with any of that crap.
408420	412340	All of those are available as plugins, and you don't have to dig through GitHub or Google
412340	415980	them, they're right in the menus and you just enable them with two clicks.
415980	420140	My biggest gripe is that the table plugin, while it does allow gooey editing of tables
420140	425380	you can't tab between cells which makes it feel ridiculous and clunky, is also really
425380	427500	ugly with this default green theme.
427500	432640	You can change the theme with GTK3 themes, but especially on Windows computers I tried
432640	437840	a bunch and none of them looked good out of the box, so expect to do manual theming because
437840	440000	no one is making ZIM themes.
440000	445160	If you hate software in general, if you can't stand seeing a project that you like get bloated
445160	450200	over time with pointless features, if you use Microsoft Outlook at work and you don't
450200	455200	understand how an email client that you use to do three things can possibly have so many
455200	460180	tabs, menus, ribbons, and buttons, ZIM is probably the program for you.
460180	464740	It is purely what you need to take simple notes and anything else is hidden from you
464740	467020	until you specifically enable it.
467020	471620	ZIM genuinely makes me sad we live in a world without more software like ZIM.
471620	475060	Alright if you want something a little more featureful and a little bit nicer looking
475060	480480	than ZIM, down from the heavens comes this traditional stupid markdown app with a double
480480	488100	pain view, fighting for first place with tomboy-ng to be the worst named application on this list,
488100	489700	cue own notes.
489700	493780	This software is so obscure in the productivity space you could barely find a YouTube video
493780	498180	where someone even talks about it, let alone an entire video dedicated to it.
498180	502180	The Linux experiment mentioned it for a whole minute once, which I'm positive is the most
502180	503960	exposure this has ever gotten.
503960	509460	The world has been so consumed by their notions and obsidians and vims that there is no room
509460	514120	in anyone's heart left for a simple native desktop markdown notes app.
514120	516040	But I love this program man.
516040	521000	It has the snappy editor with the markdown preview, there is no stupid javascript stuff
521000	525200	that pops up while you type, it doesn't try to organize your notes into logical blocks
525200	528780	or guess what you want to select, when you paste text in there's not going to be any
528780	534200	weird formatting, and it has a truly customizable interface that can be as dumb and bloated
534200	536240	or as minimalist as you want.
536240	540220	Again, I hate menus and buttons and panels and software that are constantly on screen
540220	544400	but I never use and you can literally turn all of it off in cue own notes.
544400	548780	For example, it has hierarchical tags, meaning you navigate to a folder and you've got all
548780	553420	your notes here, and then you can click through your tag hierarchy to narrow down which of
553420	554940	those notes you want to see.
554940	558940	This is apparently a killer feature to some people, I don't even use tags?
558940	560380	Not for me, it's gone.
560380	565100	The navigation has separate folder navigation and notes navigation pane, so first you go
565120	569400	to the folder that has notes within it and then in a separate panel you click the note
569400	570560	within that folder.
570560	575640	I'm more used to a single tree where everything appears in the same pane, but I guess I could
575640	576840	get used to this.
576840	581280	But then I go to settings and I go to experimental and there's literally one setting and it
581280	584560	makes the navigation look exactly how I want it to.
584560	586600	It's like the program is reading my mind.
586600	590720	Up top there's an incredibly convenient encrypted notes feature that's easier to use
590720	593040	than the vast majority of these apps.
593040	594040	Thank you.
594040	598140	Look at this, I'm synced to my next cloud server and I can just check and restore version
598140	599740	history for every note.
599740	602900	Does Obsidian even do this so nicely and if it does, don't tell me.
602900	606660	Yeah, you can use Git to do this manually, but this is so convenient.
606660	610900	And I mean, this is Linux, you can't dismiss a notification without opening the terminal
610900	615540	and checking stack overflow, but I just put in my server IP and credentials into settings
615540	619180	and all of this just worked automatically, no problems.
619180	622860	Maybe it's just years of software abuse that I've dealt with, but I just didn't expect
622880	625120	this feature to work with like one click.
625120	628920	And I know this is a minor thing, but this program, it's like whatever the opposite
628920	631080	of death by a thousand cuts is.
631080	633400	All these good themes are built right in.
633400	636440	It doesn't come with a crappy light and a crappy dark theme and like you have to go
636440	641040	to GitHub to go find a real theme, you can just pick Monokai, a real welcome change after
641040	642440	looking at Zim.
642440	646840	Like hey, I still love Zim, but I don't know guys, maybe build in like one dark theme
646840	648520	that's not green.
648520	650780	Nothing gets in my way with QO notes.
650780	654940	Nothing pops up, nothing slows down, nothing acts in an unexpected way.
654940	657940	There's nothing I don't want that I can't just simply hide.
657940	660580	If I right click a note, I can open it in my file manager.
660580	663060	V note has that, but Zim and Zettler don't.
663060	665820	It's not make or break, but it's a five second convenience.
665820	669780	If I press control and mouse wheel up and down, that increases or decreases the font
669780	672300	size, which is exactly what I would expect it to do.
672300	676380	For comparison, Zim does nothing, Zettler does nothing and V note works the same way,
676380	678800	but it scrolls the text at the same time, so it's annoying.
678800	683000	And yet guessing hotkeys is maybe not the best metric of software quality, but I don't
683000	687320	know man, when you download someone's bootleg free GitHub project and everything just works
687320	691040	exactly how you would expect, it just feels a little magical.
691040	694720	The minor issues I have with it are inherent to any Markdown editor.
694720	699240	The split view for Markdown editors just feels like a fundamental design problem with Markdown
699240	701800	in general, it is just this really weird thing.
701800	705440	The editor doesn't have as many fancy rich text features, it will change your font size
705500	709780	and colors, but you can't display images in line, so you will need to look at the preview
709780	711180	pane to see images.
711180	713780	It does have this little table editor though, and that's kind of nice.
713780	716580	I kind of feel like the same way as this reddit post.
716580	717860	Am I missing something?
717860	722540	Why don't the simple Markdown editors come up more in lists of productivity tools?
722540	726420	Surely there are people who just need to take some notes and don't need to spend their
726420	731260	lives optimizing productivity software into a life operating system.
731260	733340	What happened to those Apple notes people?
733340	736400	Surely there are people who have seen the light and they're overcomplicating their
736400	738680	productivity workflows, right?
738680	743120	Big thumbs up to QO Notes, I know it doesn't look very distinct from a lot of other Markdown
743120	747520	programs, but I can't emphasize enough how I never had to dig through documentation,
747520	751120	I never had to search the web to solve an issue, and everything worked exactly how I
751120	752480	expected it to.
752480	758680	Now before I continue, I'm about to talk about Emacs and NeoVim, and I very much believe
758680	763740	it's possible to cross the point where futzing with your productivity software outweighs
763740	765640	the benefit of doing so.
765640	768940	How much time have you wasted getting your Notion layout just right?
768940	773840	Background pictures here, columns just so cute icons, maybe you've wasted time refactoring
773840	779020	your Obsidian Graph, moving index pages around, fixing and changing backlinks, trying some
779020	782800	stupid new system you saw on YouTube that works for someone else.
782800	789360	You are wasting time right now, watching a video about productivity is not productivity.
789360	792720	I don't care that you're on your morning run and you just put this random video on
792720	793820	in the background.
793820	797040	The fact that you're here means you are prone to this.
797040	802100	If you genuinely care about being productive, Emacs and Vim are bullshit.
802100	806960	I have spent many, many hours doing random things like shaving a few milliseconds off
806960	811800	my boot up time, optimizing keybindings, or troubleshooting random GitHub extensions
811800	815320	that purport to make my life ever so slightly easier.
815320	818860	Literally while I was recording footage for this video, I found there was a breaking change
818860	823480	in Emacs org mode since I last used it, so I had to roll back to an earlier version of
823480	827880	org mode, which involves pinning the old version of org, deleting a directory, rerunning an
827880	832480	install script, thankfully smart people on GitHub already figured this out for me.
832480	836720	And this isn't common, but this is stupid troubleshooting crap that's not your fault
836720	839680	that you'll have to deal with if you don't just use QO notes.
839680	843440	And this is besides the initial investment of just learning how to use these if you're
843440	844960	not a software developer.
844960	849240	If you already live in these editors and you have your hyper-optimized configs, you're
849240	853640	probably already taking notes with them so you don't need my experience from this video.
853640	857640	Unlike probably most people watching this who care about things like free and open source
857640	861720	software, I'm not a software developer, so I'm coming from the perspective of someone
861720	866160	who mainly uses these text editors for notes and tasks rather than someone who completely
866160	867880	lives in them for their job.
867880	872280	So if you're a normal person who actually needs to be productive, you kinda don't want
872280	873280	none of this.
873280	877120	The learning curve, the troubleshooting, the endless tweaking, like seriously just use
877120	878120	Zim.
878120	883840	But that being said, these are obviously the most personal customizable and by far the
883840	886400	most fun pieces of software on this list.
886400	889440	Fun is not a productivity metric, but life is short.
889440	892280	Last year I had no idea what Emacs actually was.
892280	897400	I saw people on Hacker News touting org mode which just looked like a way to fold bulleted
897400	902600	lists, but otherwise I thought it was just some terminal text editor for boomer diehards
902600	905280	who use weird 1970s keybindings.
905280	909600	As someone who has never even considered Emacs a sensible piece of software to use in the
909600	913680	21st century, Emacs fucking rules!
913680	915440	Emacs is really everything.
915440	919480	It's both a terminal program and a GUI program, which I didn't even know because it's so
919480	920480	text based.
920480	924760	Mouse support is totally reasonable with Emacs and an intended feature, although your nerd
924760	926560	friends will still make fun of you for that.
926560	927560	But it works fine.
927560	932040	And the GUI allows for things like switching between fonts, font sizes, and inline images.
932040	934880	No stupid secondary markdown window required.
934880	939080	Having a terminal version of the app with most of the same features means I can SSH into
939080	942100	my home server and run it from any device.
942100	946920	Having the text based GUI but also a terminal version really gives you the best of both worlds.
946920	952360	Now I use Doom Emacs which basically gives you Vim keybindings, an easy to modify configuration,
952360	953440	and a nice theme.
953440	958180	Because I mean, I'm not crazy, Emacs kind of sucks, but Doom Emacs makes it super usable
958180	959180	out of the box.
959180	963560	I did watch like 10 hours of tutorials on how to set up Emacs from scratch and then
963560	967440	after all that I ditched my scratch config and kept using Doom Emacs.
967440	970000	So what is org mode?
970000	973920	I don't even know man, it's another rabbit hole on top of Emacs.
973920	979600	It has all the things you think it has, automatically bulleting lists, checkboxes, headings, folding.
979600	983120	Of course you can link between files into headings and other files.
983120	985800	It has its own scheduling and agenda system.
985800	990280	You can put dates and deadlines on tasks and it will show you your whole agenda.
990280	993960	This isn't some Emacs to-do list feature that's separate from your document.
993960	999060	Your agenda is built from the to-do list and deadline syntax in your document.
999060	1002440	Everything in org mode is built from the plain text in the document.
1002440	1004520	It is like a dream come true.
1004520	1007400	From the tables, oh my god, the tables.
1007400	1011600	You just start typing your content and put bars around cells and it automatically formats
1011600	1012960	the table for you.
1012960	1017840	Tab and shift tab to move around, create separators with just two characters, just this super
1017840	1020440	intuitive syntax for things like alignment.
1020440	1024240	I said Zettler is the program for tables, but if you're committed to the way of plain
1024240	1027920	text I have never had a better time making tables.
1027920	1032480	And it's not just the formatting, you can evaluate expressions, you can run code, you
1032480	1035640	can crunch data from within your org document.
1035640	1039000	It's a programmable spreadsheet in text form.
1039000	1043040	This is where org mode went from, okay so it's basically a markdown editor with some
1043040	1048880	really nice tables to, org mode is a being of unlimited power and I'm staring into the
1048880	1052880	abyss of possibility and I don't even know where to start.
1052880	1056600	Like I realize these super fancy features like running code from within a text document
1056600	1060680	is totally defeating the purpose of vendor lock-in, but also Emacs has been around for
1060680	1063920	50 years so maybe this one program gets a pass.
1063920	1069080	And on top of all of this there's the plugin org roam as in roam research.
1069080	1073080	This gives you backlinks in your graph which I kind of question the true necessity of,
1073080	1074360	but maybe it's your thing.
1074360	1078720	But it also gives you this really convenient note capture buffer with different note templates.
1078720	1082880	I've got one template that puts hierarchical notes into the correct spot in the hierarchy
1082880	1087840	and then another template that stores unorganized notes in a separate directory.
1087840	1090960	My system is chaos, but you know, shut up your system is too.
1090960	1092240	You don't even have a system.
1092240	1095080	You're watching a YouTube video on notes apps.
1095080	1099560	Another thing I really like about org roam is it stores every note with a unique identifier.
1099560	1104800	This means that you can link to any file regardless of where it is in the directory structure
1104800	1106060	or its file name.
1106060	1109800	So if you'd like to organize your notes into directories or you find yourself renaming
1109800	1112120	them, it's never going to mess up your links.
1112120	1115320	And I guess if any plugin developers are watching this, just do this.
1115320	1119400	Why do I got to worry about what changing my file name or moving my file, messing up
1119400	1121280	all my links, just use this unique identifier?
1121280	1122720	It is so much better.
1122720	1127760	I've lamented complicated, overly featureful software earlier in this video and Emacs is
1127760	1131160	objectively complicated and overly featureful.
1131160	1134720	But it's also Willy Wonka's chocolate factory for editing text.
1134720	1139720	It just feels magical and unlimited because it's so text focused, but the GUI allows
1139720	1142160	for things that a terminal couldn't do.
1142160	1146600	And unexpectedly, it was totally not intimidating to get started with.
1146600	1151400	I found Doom Emacs relatively easy to pick up considering Emacs's reputation for stupid
1151400	1155720	keybindings and I was only one of those occasional Vim users before this.
1155720	1159140	It wasn't some grueling learning curve like switching your keyboard layout.
1159140	1163560	If you're this deep into YouTube watching a video about open source software, you either
1163560	1167500	know it already or you're motivated enough to learn how to use Emacs.
1167500	1172820	If Emacs has a main issue, it's not exactly snappy.
1172820	1175220	No issue on my high spec Linux desktop.
1175220	1177660	On Windows, a little bit chunkier.
1177660	1182820	On my underpowered work issued Lenovo Windows 11 laptop, it was slow.
1182820	1184340	There's no two ways about it.
1184340	1188340	Firefox can be slow, we all still love Firefox, but it wasn't great.
1188340	1189820	And on my phone, it sucked.
1189820	1193700	And I'm not talking about some app, I literally just installed Doom Emacs on my phone, which
1193700	1197580	surprisingly worked without any issue, except that it's garbage and you shouldn't do that.
1197580	1202060	So I figured my best bet was to install Doom Emacs on my home server so that if I'm on
1202060	1206300	a slow device, I could just SSH into my server and run it from there.
1206300	1208980	Except that it doesn't run well in a Raspberry Pi either.
1208980	1211700	Haha, now you think you see where this is going.
1211700	1215020	This is where he's going to say he switched to Vim because it's faster.
1215020	1216020	No!
1216020	1217020	No!
1217020	1223300	I bought a $500 Ryzen 7 mini PC alongside my Raspberry Pi and I specifically overspecied
1223580	1226940	it to make sure it would run Emacs as smooth as possible.
1226940	1229780	This thing can play AAA video games.
1229780	1231620	What did you buy your home server for?
1231620	1233940	Home automation, virtualization, storage?
1233940	1237860	Yeah, I bought it to run a heavyweight text editor.
1237860	1239940	Emacs rules!
1239940	1242060	I'm telling you guys.
1242060	1245940	It's not for old nerds, it is a totally cool program for normal people.
1245940	1249260	I realize that Outburst does not make me sound like a normal person.
1249260	1253260	Alright, as much as I love Emacs, I find myself using a way to make it work.
1253260	1257540	There's a wide variety of computers and I found myself SSH'd into that home server
1257540	1258540	a lot.
1258540	1261740	While it's super cool that there's a terminal version of Emacs that basically
1261740	1267140	has all the same features as the GUI version, when like 75% of the time I'm missing things
1267140	1272220	like images, fonts, and font sizes, I'm starting to wonder why I'm going through all this
1272220	1276540	effort to run basically a terminal program most of the time.
1276540	1279860	Which of course is what led me to NeoVim.
1279860	1283460	Ladies and gentlemen, we have officially reached the point in the video where I can
1283460	1288820	make the thumbnail, I switched from Emacs to NeoVim and 5000 people will watch it just
1288820	1291060	to have their pre-existing opinion validated.
1291060	1296260	NeoVim is of course just a text editor and it's as far from notion as we can get and
1296260	1300460	we're giving up fancy things like fonts and images off the bat now.
1300460	1304740	There's some workarounds to get some kind of image support like with NB but this is
1304740	1308860	a terminal program so that stuff is obviously not first class.
1308860	1312860	And another cool thing about Emacs is that you're probably not really deciding what
1312860	1315020	plugins you're going to use for notes.
1315020	1318980	You're going to use the built-in org mode or you're just going to get the org Rome
1318980	1321020	plugin that goes with org mode.
1321020	1328020	With Vim not only is there Vim versus NeoVim, but conservatively let's say VimWiki, WikiVim,
1328020	1333980	TaskWiki, VimWiki, Neuron.Vim, Neuron.NVim, different project, Vim2, Notoir, VimNotes,
1333980	1338700	VimTableMode, NeoVimOrgMode, NVimOrgMode, OrgVim, VimRome, VimSettle, VimZetalCache,
1339060	1344820	ZK-NVimZetal.Vim, the list goes on and on with projects that don't have as easily guessable
1344820	1345820	names.
1345820	1349820	And you've got markdown, org syntax, VimWiki syntax, Norx syntax.
1349820	1354860	There are a lot more options and a lot more partial implementations whereas org mode is
1354860	1357180	sort of this monolithic complete thing.
1357180	1359580	Anyway, my notes look like this now.
1359580	1364420	I have truly achieved my goal of turning my text files into slightly more organized text
1364420	1365420	files.
1365420	1369860	I don't want to pump any particular plugins because they share a lot of functionality.
1369860	1375100	What really matters is how easy it is to create link and search notes and basically all of
1375100	1378460	them are good at that with some differences in their accoutrements.
1378460	1382660	I ended up using Neorg which is not at all a very mature plugin.
1382660	1387220	And some might say needlessly reinventing the wheel by introducing its own syntax but
1387220	1391080	I really didn't want to use an org mode plugin that had like one or two missing features
1391080	1395960	or differences from Emacs and then just say well this sucks compared to really Emacs.
1395960	1399480	So instead I'm using an unfinished plugin so it's really easy to make excuses when
1399480	1401080	it's missing functionality.
1401080	1403080	Also it has the best logo by far.
1403080	1405880	You guys don't make your software choices based on logos.
1405880	1406880	Zim?
1406880	1407880	Ugh.
1407880	1408880	QO notes?
1408880	1409880	What year is it?
1409880	1410880	Log seek?
1410880	1411880	It looks like a paw print.
1411880	1412880	Stupid.
1412880	1413880	And obsidian?
1413880	1414880	Wait what?
1414880	1416360	This logo has reactive reflections?
1416360	1418600	Is that even legal in graphic design?
1418600	1420360	Alright screw the rest of this video.
1420360	1421840	I'm going back to obsidian.
1421840	1425540	But for real I think there are enough other YouTube videos going over what Vim plugins
1425540	1427360	make the greatest system ever.
1427360	1432000	I'm a big fan of hierarchically organized index pages with numeric identifiers.
1432000	1436160	You'll notice that what I was doing in Vim was simplified from the fancy table I tried
1436160	1437160	to make in Emacs.
1437160	1439840	I was really into Emacs tables when I was using that.
1439840	1445560	But my pages are numbered like 202.1a and that's my trip notes for the Colorado trail.
1445560	1452840	200 is hobbies, 202 is backpacking, 202.1 is trips, 202.1a the first trip Colorado trail.
1452840	1458400	This way the files organize themselves hierarchically by filename and each note has a unique ID.
1458400	1461760	But again personal note taking systems are nonsense.
1461760	1465880	You do things that I think are a pointless waste of time, I do things you think are incorrectly
1465880	1469920	structured and destroying my life, everyone has a personal system, all of us take notes
1469920	1470920	wrong.
1470920	1475760	Do your quote unquote modified Zettel Kasten system as if every note taking system ever
1475760	1479920	devised isn't just a slightly different way of organizing blurbs of text.
1479920	1482160	So is Neo Vim good?
1482160	1483400	Yeah?
1483400	1488080	Have I achieved my goal of distraction free fast simple notes that is obviously never
1488080	1490200	going to be commercialized?
1490200	1491200	Absolutely yes.
1491200	1494840	Does this mean this is the most productive software I could be using?
1494840	1495840	No.
1495840	1500680	I find Neo Vim harder to configure than Emacs and to be clear NV Chad and Doom Emacs which
1500680	1503380	are both text editor distributions for dummies.
1503380	1507320	There's been another learning curve and that means many more hours of tutorials and
1507320	1508320	troubleshooting.
1508320	1512840	Neo Vim does less out of the box than anything else so I have to find and configure more
1512840	1513840	plugins.
1513840	1515920	Things in Neo Vim also seem to change a lot.
1515920	1520120	Two years ago people were using Vim script configuration files, now everyone uses Lua
1520120	1521760	configuration files.
1521760	1526360	Vim plug used to be the package manager of choice then it was Packer and now it's lazy.
1526360	1530800	The organization plugin I use, Neorg, isn't even finished so I have to follow development
1530800	1535360	to see if I like any of the future features or if I stick my nose up at it, call it bloated
1535360	1537040	and have to go find something else.
1537040	1543080	So I have my perfect simple note system with a turbulent overly customizable piece of software.
1543080	1547040	But again, it's fun, life is short, we all have our weaknesses.
1547040	1548040	It's a weird trade off.
1548040	1552360	My first recommendation to someone off the street would probably just be to use Vim.
1552360	1557200	My mom is never going to wrap her head around Neo Vim and even if she does, she's not
1557200	1560160	going to keep up with it over time and something's going to break.
1560160	1565360	The search for perfect software when I already have perfectly fine software has never stopped.
1565360	1568000	You know how it goes, look at how long this video is.
1568000	1574120	Neo Vim is certainly as simple, fast and usable as I could ever want and Vim is super popular
1574120	1576840	and it will be supported in some form forever.
1576840	1580400	But when you have perfect, why not search for something better for no reason?
1580400	1584840	My next plan is getting rid of NVChad, which is a Neo Vim based config that I ended up not
1584840	1585840	really needing.
1585840	1589880	Emacs does not resemble software a human being would use out of the box.
1589880	1592600	Do Me Max makes Emacs totally sane and usable.
1592600	1597520	Neo Vim on the other hand already resembles a usable text editor and the NVChad configuration
1597520	1601080	directory structure is a lot more work and reading to understand.
1601080	1603120	For example, I don't need tabs.
1603120	1607840	In Do Me Max, I just open init.el, find the tabs module and comment it out.
1607840	1613560	In NVChad, I go to luacustomplugins.lua and I have to find wherever the exact name of
1613560	1618360	the plugin is documented in NVChad docs and then set enable to false.
1618360	1622640	So yeah, stupid user just has to read the docs, but I only used NVChad to begin with
1622640	1626000	because I found Do Me Max so incredibly useful.
1626000	1629800	And on Neo Vim, I think it would be easier to actually just roll my own config than to
1629800	1633320	turn off all the crap I don't need with one of these base configs.
1633320	1638280	I also looked at simpler editors that software developers seem to turn their nose up at simply
1638280	1639600	because it's not Vim.
1639600	1644600	Cocoon is a really interesting modal editor that's almost like if Vim normal and visual
1644600	1647880	modes were combined and the key mappings were reversed.
1647880	1651920	It emphasizes a limited scope so it doesn't include things like window management, file
1651920	1656520	management, or IDE features, but it does have a small wiki and table plugin.
1656520	1661120	I really like its philosophy of just being a text editor rather than an entire development
1661120	1662120	platform.
1662120	1665960	It's also Helix, which seems like Cocoon with some more developer crap built in, but
1665960	1669640	it doesn't support plugins yet so it's not really in consideration right now.
1669640	1674760	Learning and switching to such a similar yet unique program would certainly not pay productivity
1674760	1679040	dividends, but there's a part of my brain nagging me that Cocoon is part of a very small
1679040	1683560	class of text editor that actually sort of follows the Unix philosophy of doing one
1683560	1687480	thing well rather than becoming a shambling mass of features.
1687480	1692280	But to be clear, like Vim is a super useful and usable shambling mass of features.
1692280	1696880	And I even looked at Super Bear Bones' hipster editors like Viz and NeatVI.
1696880	1701720	NeatVI is something like 6,000 lines of C code and you could forget about unnecessary
1701720	1707080	features like mouse support or opening multiple files, but it does have a key mapping that
1707080	1712040	opens a file path under the cursor, and I mean, this sure isn't Vim wiki, but this
1712040	1715720	is dangerously close to the core of a really simple linked note system.
1715720	1718760	We have gone too far down the rabbit hole, I just kind of wanted to take you here for
1718760	1719760	the sake of it.
1719760	1724280	It's kind of hilarious that a video that started with the words I need a notion replacement
1724280	1729960	took us to the most hipster text editors out there like Cocoon and NeatVI, but if you want
1729960	1735560	to be the coolest, most suckless, most minimal-lit note-taking hacker out there, I don't know
1735560	1738240	how it's possible to get more minimal than NeatVI.
1738240	1742320	You'd just be using ED at that point, or God forbid, a notebook.
1742320	1745760	But, and this isn't engagement bait, just look at my channel, there's no subscribers,
1745760	1747600	this obviously is never getting monetized.
1747600	1752080	If you have gone some ultra-minimalist software route, that's not just like one text file,
1752080	1755200	I'm really interested to know what's actually usable for you.
1755200	1759800	Anyway, I hate software, I hate computers, I hate note-taking, the fact that I even like
1759800	1764240	four entire programs in a single category of software, and I didn't just end up as
1764240	1767920	one of those single giant text file people is astounding to me.
1767920	1772240	You should try and use any of these, or I don't know, leave an angry comment about me dismissing
1772240	1775760	LogSeek, this video is way too long, I know.
1775760	1781560	This script started months ago as an ode to QO notes being such an under-discussed note-taking
1781560	1782560	platform.
1782560	1787320	Then the script shifted to, wait, Emacs is actually a great piece of software for regular
1787320	1788760	people's script?
1788760	1793120	And now it ended up as a, I guess I'm just using Vim plugins like every other nerd to
1793120	1794560	take notes video.
1794560	1798560	Which is kind of a zazzle list finale because there's already tons of popular videos from
1798560	1801760	Linux nerds and software devs about how great Vim is.
1802120	1803960	Alright, bye.
1803960	1804960	Good luck in your search.
1804960	1805960	Do I have hope for you?
1805960	1806960	No.
1806960	1809240	If you've watched this whole video, you are lost.
1809240	1812560	You're just gonna click the sidebar and click another productivity video.
1812560	1814400	You're gonna tweak your system more.
1814400	1816880	You're not actually gonna use your notes and get things done.
1816880	1817880	Amir?
1817880	1819600	Yes, Amir, I'm talking to you.
1819600	1821200	This is your wake-up call.
1821200	1823040	Stop watching these YouTube videos.
1823040	1824160	Get some actual work done.
