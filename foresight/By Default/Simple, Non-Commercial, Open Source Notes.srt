00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
Last year, I finally decided I need a Notion replacement.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,520
I was sick of big tech stealing my data, their employees stealing my nudes, and feeding my

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,960
high quality, high value personal notes and documents to sell to advertisers or train

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:12,960
large language models.

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,120
They're all doing it, I don't care what their privacy policy says, one day they're

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:20,320
just gonna update it and it's, oh yeah, your data is yours, except psych, we're creating

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,400
personally identified consumer profiles of your internet activity, GPS data, and selling

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,760
it to advertisers.

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,160
And yes, even though you didn't upload them, Notion has your nudes, I don't make the

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,160
rules.

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,000
So before I waste your time, I need a Notion replacement for a personal wiki notes, to-dos

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,360
and documents, not the 400 other things that Notion tries to be.

13
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,000
So I needed a program that is free, non-commercial open source.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
This is philosophical, and most people don't care, so this might not be the right video

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
for you.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,280
I don't want development to be beholden to venture capital, prioritize monetizing a

17
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,520
cloud service, or, underrated reason, build on pointless checkbox features for the sake

18
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,600
of marketplace differentiation.

19
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,880
So if it's run by a business or has a pricing tab on the website, even if it's totally

20
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,600
free for personal use, it's probably not for me.

21
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,160
Like LogSeq is funded by $4 million in venture capital, cool, get that bag.

22
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:14,120
I just need to turn my text files into slightly more organized text files.

23
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:18,040
I think this is a problem that can be solved without incorporating a business to extract

24
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,880
value from the solution.

25
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,400
Local and self-hosted.

26
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,480
Privacy and data ownership is the biggest reason I needed to get off Notion, so there's

27
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,580
no sense in just giving my data over to another cloud service, no matter how private it currently

28
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:29,720
claims to be.

29
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,480
Storing notes as plain text.

30
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,320
I want zero vendor lock-in.

31
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,720
I want to sync my notes using whatever program I want, I want to use my own version control,

32
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:42,760
I want to be able to view my files on everything from a Commodore 64 to an Amazon Kindle without

33
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,480
worrying about client software.

34
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:48,380
When my new software inevitably dies, I just want to dump my notes folder into whatever

35
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,920
the new thing I'm using is.

36
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,920
And fast.

37
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,680
Notion is the slowest note-taking software I have ever used.

38
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,900
And while I said this bit, I was going to put in a little clip of me clicking a link

39
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,280
and it taking two seconds for the page to load.

40
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,040
But instead for dramatic effect, I went to click a database view and the page took 24

41
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,760
seconds to load.

42
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,760
Notion is garbage!

43
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:11,760
Alright, and some nice-to-haves, simple, I don't need a second brain, or dear god,

44
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:18,680
a life-operating system with databases, kanban charts, whatever endless features.

45
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,960
I just need to store notes, scripts, recipes, travel plans, whatever.

46
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,520
A bright future throwing this out there because Dendron suddenly ceased development in the

47
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,260
middle of my search.

48
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,260
Encrypted notes.

49
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,260
A lot of these projects are just like, oh, encrypt your entire hard drive, we're not

50
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,260
an encryption project.

51
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:36,340
Well, guess what, I do encrypt my hard drives, but I do this really weird thing called decrypting

52
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,100
them when I'm using my computer.

53
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,860
And I also sync and back up my notes to all sorts of devices.

54
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:46,140
Which yes, should be encrypted, but it's still nice to know if I accidentally sync or back

55
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,940
up my notes somewhere that's not encrypted that personal info and account numbers and

56
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,180
stuff would still be encrypted within my notes.

57
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:55,300
Alright, let's quickly run down everything that didn't make the cut so you don't think

58
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,560
I forgot about your favorite note app because you're just watching this video to see if

59
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,400
some guy on YouTube ended up using the same thing as you.

60
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:06,000
Leave a thumbs down when I get to your favorite proprietary or commercial software, Obsidian,

61
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,240
OneNote, Evernote, Rome, LogSeek, Taipora, BoostNote, StandardNote, SimpleNote, Notable

62
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:16,040
used to be open source, isn't anymore, mem.ai, NotesNook, and Google Keep.

63
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,760
Programs that don't store notes in plain text are CherryTree, Laverna, Tomboy, NG,

64
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,280
TiddlyWiki, I used to use that in college, TiddlyRome had no idea that existed, but that's

65
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,180
cool as hell.

66
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:30,420
And finally, Joplin and Trillium, which look like two nice options if you don't care

67
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,540
that notes are just stored in a SQLite database.

68
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:36,460
I did consider all of these though, and the case in point is Dendrin, which wouldn't

69
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:41,060
have made my cut anyway, but I loved how Dendrin stores notes via hierarchically organized

70
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,060
filenames in a flat directory.

71
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:47,300
This was my favorite method of any program I considered, and I adopted a similar system

72
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,300
myself.

73
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,580
Now, you may have noticed I just threw out almost every note app you ever considered

74
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:56,840
because yeah, the non-commercial open source plain text notes software scene is a little

75
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,840
bit niche.

76
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,600
I ended up with four programs that I really like that probably suit different people.

77
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,880
In the end, I don't think it matters what you use as long as you stick with it and use

78
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:08,960
it to the full potential, and get off the productivity treadmill that you're currently

79
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,360
on because it's a disaster, I promise.

80
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,800
Before that, real quick, ThreeRunnersUp did meet all of my criteria.

81
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,440
Zettler is a markdown editor with a really fancy editing window.

82
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:23,100
It's got these gooey tables which save as plain text, and yes, that is very fancy.

83
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,820
It has this little hidden folding bar on the left side of the editing window as you can

84
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,860
see everything, resizes and recolors itself.

85
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,700
It is a very beautiful program.

86
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:35,900
The only minor issue I even have with it is that sometimes it feels a little bit too fancy.

87
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,340
You've got this little window that pops up whenever you select text, and sometimes when

88
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:43,020
you try to select something, the text window just tries to guess what you're trying to

89
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,980
select rather than go where the cursor is.

90
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,220
I have no idea why programs ever do this.

91
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,800
You also have to control click links just because it's primarily an editing window.

92
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,000
But super minor nitpicks aside, if you were looking for like full-featured desktop software,

93
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,040
Zettler is by far the most beautiful program on the list.

94
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,560
There's also VNote, which wow, 10,000 stars on GitHub and I have never heard of this come

95
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,120
up anywhere once.

96
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,680
Maybe there's some cool feature, but this really just seems worse than Zettler to me.

97
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:13,280
This is also a markdown editor, and it has a toggle between editing mode and read mode.

98
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,600
Except on two separate computers, I couldn't get the read mode to work, and you can't

99
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:20,220
follow links from within edit mode, which kind of made it unusable.

100
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:24,340
I mean, this is Linux, so it's probably my fault for being a dumb user, but I'm just

101
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,740
saying my experience here.

102
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,980
And then there's also NB if you're a nerd.

103
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:32,300
This is a single bash script that runs from the terminal and organizes notes for you.

104
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,220
You can open and edit the notes in whatever text editor you want.

105
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:40,260
It even has fancy features like linked notes, encrypted notes, inserting images into notebooks.

106
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:43,980
The only reason it's not for me is because I can just use plugins from within a text

107
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,640
editor to do pretty much all of this, rather than having to run a separate script alongside

108
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,640
it.

109
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,640
Alright.

110
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,640
Zim.

111
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,400
Now we're getting to the really excellent stuff.

112
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,520
Zim is as simple as it gets, a hierarchical list of notes.

113
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,520
The editor doesn't support markdown, but instead it has a very snappy, rich text editor

114
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,720
where you use shortcuts like Ctrl 123 to make headings, or Ctrl I to italicize.

115
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,140
Attachments and pictures just drag into the editor like you'd expect.

116
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:13,920
The files themselves are stored as legible plain text, but it does have its own weird

117
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,600
syntax, and attachments and images are stored in a separate folder.

118
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,520
In Zim, each note is a parent node to the notes underneath it, meaning the notes organize

119
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,920
themselves hierarchically rather than having a folder structure on top of it.

120
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,560
Basically, each folder is also a note.

121
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:34,360
This is similar to Notion or Dendron, and I personally love it, but most apps seem to

122
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:39,440
use the folder or graph paradigms rather than just pure hierarchical notes for some reason.

123
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,180
It's also got all the features you might want, like tags, tables, task lists, journals,

124
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:48,420
encrypted notes, but by default it doesn't burden you with any of that crap.

125
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:52,340
All of those are available as plugins, and you don't have to dig through GitHub or Google

126
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:55,980
them, they're right in the menus and you just enable them with two clicks.

127
00:06:55,980 --> 00:07:00,140
My biggest gripe is that the table plugin, while it does allow gooey editing of tables

128
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:05,380
you can't tab between cells which makes it feel ridiculous and clunky, is also really

129
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,500
ugly with this default green theme.

130
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:12,640
You can change the theme with GTK3 themes, but especially on Windows computers I tried

131
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:17,840
a bunch and none of them looked good out of the box, so expect to do manual theming because

132
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,000
no one is making ZIM themes.

133
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,160
If you hate software in general, if you can't stand seeing a project that you like get bloated

134
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:30,200
over time with pointless features, if you use Microsoft Outlook at work and you don't

135
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:35,200
understand how an email client that you use to do three things can possibly have so many

136
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:40,180
tabs, menus, ribbons, and buttons, ZIM is probably the program for you.

137
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:44,740
It is purely what you need to take simple notes and anything else is hidden from you

138
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,020
until you specifically enable it.

139
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:51,620
ZIM genuinely makes me sad we live in a world without more software like ZIM.

140
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:55,060
Alright if you want something a little more featureful and a little bit nicer looking

141
00:07:55,060 --> 00:08:00,480
than ZIM, down from the heavens comes this traditional stupid markdown app with a double

142
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:08,100
pain view, fighting for first place with tomboy-ng to be the worst named application on this list,

143
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,700
cue own notes.

144
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:13,780
This software is so obscure in the productivity space you could barely find a YouTube video

145
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:18,180
where someone even talks about it, let alone an entire video dedicated to it.

146
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:22,180
The Linux experiment mentioned it for a whole minute once, which I'm positive is the most

147
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,960
exposure this has ever gotten.

148
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:29,460
The world has been so consumed by their notions and obsidians and vims that there is no room

149
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:34,120
in anyone's heart left for a simple native desktop markdown notes app.

150
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,040
But I love this program man.

151
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:41,000
It has the snappy editor with the markdown preview, there is no stupid javascript stuff

152
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,200
that pops up while you type, it doesn't try to organize your notes into logical blocks

153
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,780
or guess what you want to select, when you paste text in there's not going to be any

154
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:54,200
weird formatting, and it has a truly customizable interface that can be as dumb and bloated

155
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,240
or as minimalist as you want.

156
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,220
Again, I hate menus and buttons and panels and software that are constantly on screen

157
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:04,400
but I never use and you can literally turn all of it off in cue own notes.

158
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,780
For example, it has hierarchical tags, meaning you navigate to a folder and you've got all

159
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:13,420
your notes here, and then you can click through your tag hierarchy to narrow down which of

160
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,940
those notes you want to see.

161
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:18,940
This is apparently a killer feature to some people, I don't even use tags?

162
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,380
Not for me, it's gone.

163
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:25,100
The navigation has separate folder navigation and notes navigation pane, so first you go

164
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,400
to the folder that has notes within it and then in a separate panel you click the note

165
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,560
within that folder.

166
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,640
I'm more used to a single tree where everything appears in the same pane, but I guess I could

167
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,840
get used to this.

168
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:41,280
But then I go to settings and I go to experimental and there's literally one setting and it

169
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,560
makes the navigation look exactly how I want it to.

170
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,600
It's like the program is reading my mind.

171
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,720
Up top there's an incredibly convenient encrypted notes feature that's easier to use

172
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,040
than the vast majority of these apps.

173
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,040
Thank you.

174
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:58,140
Look at this, I'm synced to my next cloud server and I can just check and restore version

175
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,740
history for every note.

176
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,900
Does Obsidian even do this so nicely and if it does, don't tell me.

177
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:06,660
Yeah, you can use Git to do this manually, but this is so convenient.

178
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:10,900
And I mean, this is Linux, you can't dismiss a notification without opening the terminal

179
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:15,540
and checking stack overflow, but I just put in my server IP and credentials into settings

180
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:19,180
and all of this just worked automatically, no problems.

181
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:22,860
Maybe it's just years of software abuse that I've dealt with, but I just didn't expect

182
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,120
this feature to work with like one click.

183
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,920
And I know this is a minor thing, but this program, it's like whatever the opposite

184
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,080
of death by a thousand cuts is.

185
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,400
All these good themes are built right in.

186
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,440
It doesn't come with a crappy light and a crappy dark theme and like you have to go

187
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:41,040
to GitHub to go find a real theme, you can just pick Monokai, a real welcome change after

188
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,440
looking at Zim.

189
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:46,840
Like hey, I still love Zim, but I don't know guys, maybe build in like one dark theme

190
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,520
that's not green.

191
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,780
Nothing gets in my way with QO notes.

192
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:54,940
Nothing pops up, nothing slows down, nothing acts in an unexpected way.

193
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:57,940
There's nothing I don't want that I can't just simply hide.

194
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,580
If I right click a note, I can open it in my file manager.

195
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:03,060
V note has that, but Zim and Zettler don't.

196
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,820
It's not make or break, but it's a five second convenience.

197
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:09,780
If I press control and mouse wheel up and down, that increases or decreases the font

198
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:12,300
size, which is exactly what I would expect it to do.

199
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:16,380
For comparison, Zim does nothing, Zettler does nothing and V note works the same way,

200
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,800
but it scrolls the text at the same time, so it's annoying.

201
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,000
And yet guessing hotkeys is maybe not the best metric of software quality, but I don't

202
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,320
know man, when you download someone's bootleg free GitHub project and everything just works

203
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:31,040
exactly how you would expect, it just feels a little magical.

204
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,720
The minor issues I have with it are inherent to any Markdown editor.

205
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,240
The split view for Markdown editors just feels like a fundamental design problem with Markdown

206
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,800
in general, it is just this really weird thing.

207
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,440
The editor doesn't have as many fancy rich text features, it will change your font size

208
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,780
and colors, but you can't display images in line, so you will need to look at the preview

209
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,180
pane to see images.

210
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,780
It does have this little table editor though, and that's kind of nice.

211
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,580
I kind of feel like the same way as this reddit post.

212
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,860
Am I missing something?

213
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:02,540
Why don't the simple Markdown editors come up more in lists of productivity tools?

214
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:06,420
Surely there are people who just need to take some notes and don't need to spend their

215
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:11,260
lives optimizing productivity software into a life operating system.

216
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,340
What happened to those Apple notes people?

217
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:16,400
Surely there are people who have seen the light and they're overcomplicating their

218
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,680
productivity workflows, right?

219
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:23,120
Big thumbs up to QO Notes, I know it doesn't look very distinct from a lot of other Markdown

220
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,520
programs, but I can't emphasize enough how I never had to dig through documentation,

221
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:31,120
I never had to search the web to solve an issue, and everything worked exactly how I

222
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,480
expected it to.

223
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:38,680
Now before I continue, I'm about to talk about Emacs and NeoVim, and I very much believe

224
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:43,740
it's possible to cross the point where futzing with your productivity software outweighs

225
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,640
the benefit of doing so.

226
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,940
How much time have you wasted getting your Notion layout just right?

227
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:53,840
Background pictures here, columns just so cute icons, maybe you've wasted time refactoring

228
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:59,020
your Obsidian Graph, moving index pages around, fixing and changing backlinks, trying some

229
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:02,800
stupid new system you saw on YouTube that works for someone else.

230
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:09,360
You are wasting time right now, watching a video about productivity is not productivity.

231
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,720
I don't care that you're on your morning run and you just put this random video on

232
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,820
in the background.

233
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:17,040
The fact that you're here means you are prone to this.

234
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:22,100
If you genuinely care about being productive, Emacs and Vim are bullshit.

235
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:26,960
I have spent many, many hours doing random things like shaving a few milliseconds off

236
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:31,800
my boot up time, optimizing keybindings, or troubleshooting random GitHub extensions

237
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,320
that purport to make my life ever so slightly easier.

238
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,860
Literally while I was recording footage for this video, I found there was a breaking change

239
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:43,480
in Emacs org mode since I last used it, so I had to roll back to an earlier version of

240
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:47,880
org mode, which involves pinning the old version of org, deleting a directory, rerunning an

241
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:52,480
install script, thankfully smart people on GitHub already figured this out for me.

242
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,720
And this isn't common, but this is stupid troubleshooting crap that's not your fault

243
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,680
that you'll have to deal with if you don't just use QO notes.

244
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,440
And this is besides the initial investment of just learning how to use these if you're

245
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,960
not a software developer.

246
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:09,240
If you already live in these editors and you have your hyper-optimized configs, you're

247
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,640
probably already taking notes with them so you don't need my experience from this video.

248
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:17,640
Unlike probably most people watching this who care about things like free and open source

249
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:21,720
software, I'm not a software developer, so I'm coming from the perspective of someone

250
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:26,160
who mainly uses these text editors for notes and tasks rather than someone who completely

251
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,880
lives in them for their job.

252
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:32,280
So if you're a normal person who actually needs to be productive, you kinda don't want

253
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,280
none of this.

254
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:37,120
The learning curve, the troubleshooting, the endless tweaking, like seriously just use

255
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,120
Zim.

256
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:43,840
But that being said, these are obviously the most personal customizable and by far the

257
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,400
most fun pieces of software on this list.

258
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,440
Fun is not a productivity metric, but life is short.

259
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,280
Last year I had no idea what Emacs actually was.

260
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:57,400
I saw people on Hacker News touting org mode which just looked like a way to fold bulleted

261
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:02,600
lists, but otherwise I thought it was just some terminal text editor for boomer diehards

262
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,280
who use weird 1970s keybindings.

263
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:09,600
As someone who has never even considered Emacs a sensible piece of software to use in the

264
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,680
21st century, Emacs fucking rules!

265
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,440
Emacs is really everything.

266
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,480
It's both a terminal program and a GUI program, which I didn't even know because it's so

267
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,480
text based.

268
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,760
Mouse support is totally reasonable with Emacs and an intended feature, although your nerd

269
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,560
friends will still make fun of you for that.

270
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,560
But it works fine.

271
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:32,040
And the GUI allows for things like switching between fonts, font sizes, and inline images.

272
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,880
No stupid secondary markdown window required.

273
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,080
Having a terminal version of the app with most of the same features means I can SSH into

274
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,100
my home server and run it from any device.

275
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:46,920
Having the text based GUI but also a terminal version really gives you the best of both worlds.

276
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:52,360
Now I use Doom Emacs which basically gives you Vim keybindings, an easy to modify configuration,

277
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,440
and a nice theme.

278
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,180
Because I mean, I'm not crazy, Emacs kind of sucks, but Doom Emacs makes it super usable

279
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,180
out of the box.

280
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:03,560
I did watch like 10 hours of tutorials on how to set up Emacs from scratch and then

281
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:07,440
after all that I ditched my scratch config and kept using Doom Emacs.

282
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,000
So what is org mode?

283
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,920
I don't even know man, it's another rabbit hole on top of Emacs.

284
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:19,600
It has all the things you think it has, automatically bulleting lists, checkboxes, headings, folding.

285
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,120
Of course you can link between files into headings and other files.

286
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,800
It has its own scheduling and agenda system.

287
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:30,280
You can put dates and deadlines on tasks and it will show you your whole agenda.

288
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,960
This isn't some Emacs to-do list feature that's separate from your document.

289
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:39,060
Your agenda is built from the to-do list and deadline syntax in your document.

290
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:42,440
Everything in org mode is built from the plain text in the document.

291
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,520
It is like a dream come true.

292
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,400
From the tables, oh my god, the tables.

293
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:51,600
You just start typing your content and put bars around cells and it automatically formats

294
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,960
the table for you.

295
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:57,840
Tab and shift tab to move around, create separators with just two characters, just this super

296
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,440
intuitive syntax for things like alignment.

297
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:04,240
I said Zettler is the program for tables, but if you're committed to the way of plain

298
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,920
text I have never had a better time making tables.

299
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:12,480
And it's not just the formatting, you can evaluate expressions, you can run code, you

300
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,640
can crunch data from within your org document.

301
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,000
It's a programmable spreadsheet in text form.

302
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,040
This is where org mode went from, okay so it's basically a markdown editor with some

303
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:28,880
really nice tables to, org mode is a being of unlimited power and I'm staring into the

304
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,880
abyss of possibility and I don't even know where to start.

305
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,600
Like I realize these super fancy features like running code from within a text document

306
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,680
is totally defeating the purpose of vendor lock-in, but also Emacs has been around for

307
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,920
50 years so maybe this one program gets a pass.

308
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:49,080
And on top of all of this there's the plugin org roam as in roam research.

309
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:53,080
This gives you backlinks in your graph which I kind of question the true necessity of,

310
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,360
but maybe it's your thing.

311
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:58,720
But it also gives you this really convenient note capture buffer with different note templates.

312
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,880
I've got one template that puts hierarchical notes into the correct spot in the hierarchy

313
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,840
and then another template that stores unorganized notes in a separate directory.

314
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,960
My system is chaos, but you know, shut up your system is too.

315
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,240
You don't even have a system.

316
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,080
You're watching a YouTube video on notes apps.

317
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:19,560
Another thing I really like about org roam is it stores every note with a unique identifier.

318
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:24,800
This means that you can link to any file regardless of where it is in the directory structure

319
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,060
or its file name.

320
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:29,800
So if you'd like to organize your notes into directories or you find yourself renaming

321
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,120
them, it's never going to mess up your links.

322
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,320
And I guess if any plugin developers are watching this, just do this.

323
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:39,400
Why do I got to worry about what changing my file name or moving my file, messing up

324
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,280
all my links, just use this unique identifier?

325
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,720
It is so much better.

326
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,760
I've lamented complicated, overly featureful software earlier in this video and Emacs is

327
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,160
objectively complicated and overly featureful.

328
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,720
But it's also Willy Wonka's chocolate factory for editing text.

329
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,720
It just feels magical and unlimited because it's so text focused, but the GUI allows

330
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,160
for things that a terminal couldn't do.

331
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,600
And unexpectedly, it was totally not intimidating to get started with.

332
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:11,400
I found Doom Emacs relatively easy to pick up considering Emacs's reputation for stupid

333
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,720
keybindings and I was only one of those occasional Vim users before this.

334
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,140
It wasn't some grueling learning curve like switching your keyboard layout.

335
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:23,560
If you're this deep into YouTube watching a video about open source software, you either

336
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:27,500
know it already or you're motivated enough to learn how to use Emacs.

337
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:32,820
If Emacs has a main issue, it's not exactly snappy.

338
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:35,220
No issue on my high spec Linux desktop.

339
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,660
On Windows, a little bit chunkier.

340
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:42,820
On my underpowered work issued Lenovo Windows 11 laptop, it was slow.

341
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,340
There's no two ways about it.

342
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:48,340
Firefox can be slow, we all still love Firefox, but it wasn't great.

343
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,820
And on my phone, it sucked.

344
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:53,700
And I'm not talking about some app, I literally just installed Doom Emacs on my phone, which

345
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:57,580
surprisingly worked without any issue, except that it's garbage and you shouldn't do that.

346
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:02,060
So I figured my best bet was to install Doom Emacs on my home server so that if I'm on

347
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:06,300
a slow device, I could just SSH into my server and run it from there.

348
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,980
Except that it doesn't run well in a Raspberry Pi either.

349
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,700
Haha, now you think you see where this is going.

350
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,020
This is where he's going to say he switched to Vim because it's faster.

351
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,020
No!

352
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,020
No!

353
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:23,300
I bought a $500 Ryzen 7 mini PC alongside my Raspberry Pi and I specifically overspecied

354
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:26,940
it to make sure it would run Emacs as smooth as possible.

355
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,780
This thing can play AAA video games.

356
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,620
What did you buy your home server for?

357
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,940
Home automation, virtualization, storage?

358
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:37,860
Yeah, I bought it to run a heavyweight text editor.

359
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,940
Emacs rules!

360
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,060
I'm telling you guys.

361
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:45,940
It's not for old nerds, it is a totally cool program for normal people.

362
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:49,260
I realize that Outburst does not make me sound like a normal person.

363
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:53,260
Alright, as much as I love Emacs, I find myself using a way to make it work.

364
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:57,540
There's a wide variety of computers and I found myself SSH'd into that home server

365
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,540
a lot.

366
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:01,740
While it's super cool that there's a terminal version of Emacs that basically

367
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:07,140
has all the same features as the GUI version, when like 75% of the time I'm missing things

368
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:12,220
like images, fonts, and font sizes, I'm starting to wonder why I'm going through all this

369
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:16,540
effort to run basically a terminal program most of the time.

370
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:19,860
Which of course is what led me to NeoVim.

371
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:23,460
Ladies and gentlemen, we have officially reached the point in the video where I can

372
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:28,820
make the thumbnail, I switched from Emacs to NeoVim and 5000 people will watch it just

373
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,060
to have their pre-existing opinion validated.

374
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:36,260
NeoVim is of course just a text editor and it's as far from notion as we can get and

375
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:40,460
we're giving up fancy things like fonts and images off the bat now.

376
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:44,740
There's some workarounds to get some kind of image support like with NB but this is

377
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:48,860
a terminal program so that stuff is obviously not first class.

378
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:52,860
And another cool thing about Emacs is that you're probably not really deciding what

379
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:55,020
plugins you're going to use for notes.

380
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:58,980
You're going to use the built-in org mode or you're just going to get the org Rome

381
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,020
plugin that goes with org mode.

382
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:08,020
With Vim not only is there Vim versus NeoVim, but conservatively let's say VimWiki, WikiVim,

383
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:13,980
TaskWiki, VimWiki, Neuron.Vim, Neuron.NVim, different project, Vim2, Notoir, VimNotes,

384
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:18,700
VimTableMode, NeoVimOrgMode, NVimOrgMode, OrgVim, VimRome, VimSettle, VimZetalCache,

385
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:24,820
ZK-NVimZetal.Vim, the list goes on and on with projects that don't have as easily guessable

386
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:25,820
names.

387
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:29,820
And you've got markdown, org syntax, VimWiki syntax, Norx syntax.

388
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:34,860
There are a lot more options and a lot more partial implementations whereas org mode is

389
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,180
sort of this monolithic complete thing.

390
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:39,580
Anyway, my notes look like this now.

391
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:44,420
I have truly achieved my goal of turning my text files into slightly more organized text

392
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,420
files.

393
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:49,860
I don't want to pump any particular plugins because they share a lot of functionality.

394
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:55,100
What really matters is how easy it is to create link and search notes and basically all of

395
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:58,460
them are good at that with some differences in their accoutrements.

396
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:02,660
I ended up using Neorg which is not at all a very mature plugin.

397
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:07,220
And some might say needlessly reinventing the wheel by introducing its own syntax but

398
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:11,080
I really didn't want to use an org mode plugin that had like one or two missing features

399
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:15,960
or differences from Emacs and then just say well this sucks compared to really Emacs.

400
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,480
So instead I'm using an unfinished plugin so it's really easy to make excuses when

401
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,080
it's missing functionality.

402
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,080
Also it has the best logo by far.

403
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,880
You guys don't make your software choices based on logos.

404
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,880
Zim?

405
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,880
Ugh.

406
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,880
QO notes?

407
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,880
What year is it?

408
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,880
Log seek?

409
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,880
It looks like a paw print.

410
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,880
Stupid.

411
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,880
And obsidian?

412
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,880
Wait what?

413
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,360
This logo has reactive reflections?

414
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,600
Is that even legal in graphic design?

415
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,360
Alright screw the rest of this video.

416
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,840
I'm going back to obsidian.

417
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,540
But for real I think there are enough other YouTube videos going over what Vim plugins

418
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,360
make the greatest system ever.

419
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:52,000
I'm a big fan of hierarchically organized index pages with numeric identifiers.

420
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,160
You'll notice that what I was doing in Vim was simplified from the fancy table I tried

421
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,160
to make in Emacs.

422
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,840
I was really into Emacs tables when I was using that.

423
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:05,560
But my pages are numbered like 202.1a and that's my trip notes for the Colorado trail.

424
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:12,840
200 is hobbies, 202 is backpacking, 202.1 is trips, 202.1a the first trip Colorado trail.

425
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:18,400
This way the files organize themselves hierarchically by filename and each note has a unique ID.

426
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,760
But again personal note taking systems are nonsense.

427
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,880
You do things that I think are a pointless waste of time, I do things you think are incorrectly

428
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,920
structured and destroying my life, everyone has a personal system, all of us take notes

429
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,920
wrong.

430
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:35,760
Do your quote unquote modified Zettel Kasten system as if every note taking system ever

431
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,920
devised isn't just a slightly different way of organizing blurbs of text.

432
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,160
So is Neo Vim good?

433
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,400
Yeah?

434
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:48,080
Have I achieved my goal of distraction free fast simple notes that is obviously never

435
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,200
going to be commercialized?

436
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,200
Absolutely yes.

437
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,840
Does this mean this is the most productive software I could be using?

438
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,840
No.

439
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,680
I find Neo Vim harder to configure than Emacs and to be clear NV Chad and Doom Emacs which

440
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,380
are both text editor distributions for dummies.

441
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:07,320
There's been another learning curve and that means many more hours of tutorials and

442
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,320
troubleshooting.

443
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,840
Neo Vim does less out of the box than anything else so I have to find and configure more

444
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,840
plugins.

445
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,920
Things in Neo Vim also seem to change a lot.

446
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:20,120
Two years ago people were using Vim script configuration files, now everyone uses Lua

447
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,760
configuration files.

448
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:26,360
Vim plug used to be the package manager of choice then it was Packer and now it's lazy.

449
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:30,800
The organization plugin I use, Neorg, isn't even finished so I have to follow development

450
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:35,360
to see if I like any of the future features or if I stick my nose up at it, call it bloated

451
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,040
and have to go find something else.

452
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:43,080
So I have my perfect simple note system with a turbulent overly customizable piece of software.

453
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:47,040
But again, it's fun, life is short, we all have our weaknesses.

454
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,040
It's a weird trade off.

455
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:52,360
My first recommendation to someone off the street would probably just be to use Vim.

456
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:57,200
My mom is never going to wrap her head around Neo Vim and even if she does, she's not

457
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,160
going to keep up with it over time and something's going to break.

458
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:05,360
The search for perfect software when I already have perfectly fine software has never stopped.

459
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,000
You know how it goes, look at how long this video is.

460
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:14,120
Neo Vim is certainly as simple, fast and usable as I could ever want and Vim is super popular

461
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,840
and it will be supported in some form forever.

462
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:20,400
But when you have perfect, why not search for something better for no reason?

463
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,840
My next plan is getting rid of NVChad, which is a Neo Vim based config that I ended up not

464
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,840
really needing.

465
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,880
Emacs does not resemble software a human being would use out of the box.

466
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,600
Do Me Max makes Emacs totally sane and usable.

467
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:37,520
Neo Vim on the other hand already resembles a usable text editor and the NVChad configuration

468
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,080
directory structure is a lot more work and reading to understand.

469
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,120
For example, I don't need tabs.

470
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:47,840
In Do Me Max, I just open init.el, find the tabs module and comment it out.

471
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:53,560
In NVChad, I go to luacustomplugins.lua and I have to find wherever the exact name of

472
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:58,360
the plugin is documented in NVChad docs and then set enable to false.

473
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:02,640
So yeah, stupid user just has to read the docs, but I only used NVChad to begin with

474
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,000
because I found Do Me Max so incredibly useful.

475
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,800
And on Neo Vim, I think it would be easier to actually just roll my own config than to

476
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:13,320
turn off all the crap I don't need with one of these base configs.

477
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:18,280
I also looked at simpler editors that software developers seem to turn their nose up at simply

478
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,600
because it's not Vim.

479
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:24,600
Cocoon is a really interesting modal editor that's almost like if Vim normal and visual

480
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,880
modes were combined and the key mappings were reversed.

481
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:31,920
It emphasizes a limited scope so it doesn't include things like window management, file

482
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:36,520
management, or IDE features, but it does have a small wiki and table plugin.

483
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:41,120
I really like its philosophy of just being a text editor rather than an entire development

484
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,120
platform.

485
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,960
It's also Helix, which seems like Cocoon with some more developer crap built in, but

486
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:49,640
it doesn't support plugins yet so it's not really in consideration right now.

487
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:54,760
Learning and switching to such a similar yet unique program would certainly not pay productivity

488
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:59,040
dividends, but there's a part of my brain nagging me that Cocoon is part of a very small

489
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:03,560
class of text editor that actually sort of follows the Unix philosophy of doing one

490
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:07,480
thing well rather than becoming a shambling mass of features.

491
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:12,280
But to be clear, like Vim is a super useful and usable shambling mass of features.

492
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:16,880
And I even looked at Super Bear Bones' hipster editors like Viz and NeatVI.

493
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,720
NeatVI is something like 6,000 lines of C code and you could forget about unnecessary

494
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:27,080
features like mouse support or opening multiple files, but it does have a key mapping that

495
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:32,040
opens a file path under the cursor, and I mean, this sure isn't Vim wiki, but this

496
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:35,720
is dangerously close to the core of a really simple linked note system.

497
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,760
We have gone too far down the rabbit hole, I just kind of wanted to take you here for

498
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,760
the sake of it.

499
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:44,280
It's kind of hilarious that a video that started with the words I need a notion replacement

500
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:49,960
took us to the most hipster text editors out there like Cocoon and NeatVI, but if you want

501
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:55,560
to be the coolest, most suckless, most minimal-lit note-taking hacker out there, I don't know

502
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:58,240
how it's possible to get more minimal than NeatVI.

503
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,320
You'd just be using ED at that point, or God forbid, a notebook.

504
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,760
But, and this isn't engagement bait, just look at my channel, there's no subscribers,

505
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,600
this obviously is never getting monetized.

506
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:12,080
If you have gone some ultra-minimalist software route, that's not just like one text file,

507
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,200
I'm really interested to know what's actually usable for you.

508
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,800
Anyway, I hate software, I hate computers, I hate note-taking, the fact that I even like

509
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:24,240
four entire programs in a single category of software, and I didn't just end up as

510
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,920
one of those single giant text file people is astounding to me.

511
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:32,240
You should try and use any of these, or I don't know, leave an angry comment about me dismissing

512
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,760
LogSeek, this video is way too long, I know.

513
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:41,560
This script started months ago as an ode to QO notes being such an under-discussed note-taking

514
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,560
platform.

515
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:47,320
Then the script shifted to, wait, Emacs is actually a great piece of software for regular

516
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,760
people's script?

517
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:53,120
And now it ended up as a, I guess I'm just using Vim plugins like every other nerd to

518
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,560
take notes video.

519
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:58,560
Which is kind of a zazzle list finale because there's already tons of popular videos from

520
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,760
Linux nerds and software devs about how great Vim is.

521
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,960
Alright, bye.

522
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,960
Good luck in your search.

523
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,960
Do I have hope for you?

524
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,960
No.

525
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,240
If you've watched this whole video, you are lost.

526
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,560
You're just gonna click the sidebar and click another productivity video.

527
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,400
You're gonna tweak your system more.

528
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,880
You're not actually gonna use your notes and get things done.

529
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,880
Amir?

530
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,600
Yes, Amir, I'm talking to you.

531
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,200
This is your wake-up call.

532
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,040
Stop watching these YouTube videos.

533
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,160
Get some actual work done.
