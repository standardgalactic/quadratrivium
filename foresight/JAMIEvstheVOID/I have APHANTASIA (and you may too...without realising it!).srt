1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's do something a little against the grain.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I'd like to kick this video off with a quick little visual experiment.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So sit back, relax, close your eyes if you want to, and I want you to think of an apple.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So you're thinking of this apple in your mind. Where is this apple?

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Is it floating in space? Is it suspended on a tree? Is it in your hand? Is it in a fruit bowl?

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Are you seeing it in first person? Does it look like it has a stalk or a leaf attached?

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Now imagine changing colour of that apple. How does it feel? Can you imagine that? How shiny is it?

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Can you rotate it 180 degrees in your mind?

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Can you put it, say, in different lighting settings, like if it was in daytime, put it in a dark nighttime setting?

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
What would it look like if you took a bite out of it?

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Try to make these images in your head as bright and vivid as you can, and hold it there. Really see it.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Okay, if you did close your eyes you can open them now, although you may have missed out on some sick animation.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
No, you didn't, don't worry, you didn't miss much.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Okay, so on a scale of 0 to 10, 0 representing seeing absolutely no image in your head, and 10 being absolutely vivid, almost like it were real.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So, where do you personally fall on this scale?

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Giving you time to think or an answer.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Alright, if you survived that.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I ran this experiment with friends and colleagues. Admittedly, most of them are creative people as I work in the creative industry, and they all fell around the 8 to 10 mark.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So, that's pretty vivid.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Many of them stating that the image in their head was so clear, it could be real. Even superimposed into reality if they wanted to.

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Oh boy, here come the top of comments.

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I was chatting to an old colleague and friend of mine.

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,000
He's now living in Vancouver and working for a super cool company, often associated with dinosaurs and space.

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Very jealous.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:08,000
And even though his strengths are in the technical side rather than artistic, he said he can even create detailed 3D blueprints in his mind.

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Also, hi Dave, you big nerd.

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Alright, so you'd think the average person would be around, you know, 4 to 6 give or take on the visual clarity spectrum.

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Four shadowing aside, I'm showing you a little intrigue to know where I fall on the scale as a highly artistic and creative individual.

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You know, I mean, it's clearly a 9 to 10 for me, right?

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Oh, congratulations, you solved my visualization puzzle.

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Not.

32
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:46,000
If only mine was a 9, heck, I'd even take a 1 because I don't see anything.

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
My mind is blank.

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm at zero.

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And I only found out that this wasn't normal a few weeks ago.

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Imagine that.

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's not funny because it's actually quite traumatizing.

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It's called aphantasia, and it was first described by Francis Galton in back, well, not too long ago actually, in 1880.

39
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And it's been pretty much unstudied up until 2005.

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
This is really recent, folks.

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm not sure if I was born with it or whether it's been due to trauma or induced growing up or, but for whatever reason, I can't see images in my mind.

42
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And knowing this now, it's kind of flipped my view on the world.

43
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
All right, to quell those crying out fake news, you can draw from memory.

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Well, yeah, I have memories.

45
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I identify images.

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
How else would I recognize the people I know and love?

47
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
How would I know the way home from work?

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
How would I know how to recognize raisins instead of mistaking them for chocolate chips?

49
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What?

50
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
That is crucial knowledge, and you can't convince me otherwise.

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Raisins are obviously a construct from the depths of the underworld, sent to torture us.

52
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Okay, maybe that's just me.

53
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I really don't like raisins.

54
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:11,000
But it's so bizarre how a mind like mine can function compared to someone that can actually generate images in their head.

55
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I literally can't imagine what it's like.

56
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Literally.

57
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,000
To put what this is like in perspective for those of you that can visualize in your mind, let's return to the Apple example.

58
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Based on strong visualizers I've spoken to, the image seems to be there in your mind

59
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
and you can probably add to the level of detail by focusing more now, you know, concentrating.

60
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,000
For me, being unable to actually picture the Apple in my head, I have to rely on factual details alone

61
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
and the connections I've made to the object in the first place.

62
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I know what the color green is, but I can't see it in my head.

63
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So you can see kind of how my mind compensates for the lack of imagery

64
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
by relying on relationships, experiences, correlations and contrasts with the visuals or object in question.

65
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
To put it simply, if the brain is like a computer that can store and access data,

66
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
mind seemingly runs perfectly fine except for the fact that the screen is switched off.

67
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Which, although I seem to have led a relatively unencumbered life without my screen,

68
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
at the end of the day it has gone unnoticed until now.

69
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
The realization of what I'm missing out on has left me feeling a little empty, to be honest.

70
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Especially as a creative person.

71
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Whenever I'd read self-help books that required you to visualize your ideal self

72
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
or even guided meditations that are asked to imagine sitting on a private beach at sunset,

73
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I could understand the concept, but I couldn't believe that anybody could actually see a beach in their head.

74
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's just fantasy talk, right?

75
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Speaking of fantasy, same goes for fiction novels.

76
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Okay, admittedly I am dyslexic as well, but I tended to avoid them because

77
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I couldn't see the appeal of reading without being able to visualize the story of the characters.

78
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Avid fiction readers quite simply baffled me until now.

79
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I always wanted to be one of those people that could curl up on a cozy windowsill while it was raining

80
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
and get lost in a good book over a good cup of coffee.

81
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
But now I understand why it seemed like such a fantasy to me.

82
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
But um...

83
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Okay, I'm going. I'm out of here.

84
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,000
The only reason I finally realized that this wasn't normal was because, drumroll, I'd be going to hypnotherapy.

85
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Oh no, shock horror, I have anxiety issues, just like every other YouTuber, am I right?

86
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
But honestly, without going into too many details, it's a lot to do with my mummy issues.

87
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And that's for another video, folks.

88
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Anyway, without going into too many details, the hypnotherapist was asking me to build my own room in my head.

89
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
A safe space, if you will.

90
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:53,000
But instead of relaxing me, it unsurprisingly stressed me out because I couldn't for the life of me picture this room.

91
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I know elements that I'd like to see in my ideal room, like lots of plants, creative flair,

92
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
wooden earthy features combined with clean minimalism and a little bit of an industrial look.

93
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I can list those individual elements, and I know factually what they would look like alone.

94
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
But I can't construct them in a scene.

95
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And so you in the audience would say,

96
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Okay, well that's well and dandy, but it doesn't explain why you're able to sustain a career focused on creative visuals

97
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
when you can't even imagine the images in your head.

98
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Ha ha, got you now.

99
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Yeah, I've spent the last few weeks being boggled by this too, but I have gathered some explanations.

100
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
First of all, it can be incredibly frustrating for me to draw.

101
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Because I can't plan out what I want to draw in my head, and up until now I thought nobody could,

102
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I have to rely solely on what I put down through sketching.

103
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I have to do immense amounts of lines and assess what looks right or wrong and filter out the good from the bad by process of elimination.

104
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It just takes a long time and it looks messy before it looks good.

105
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
If I'm trying to create something new and imaginative, I have to look at copious amounts of reference,

106
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
which you know, you should do as an artist anyway, but I can't retain any of the images in my head,

107
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
which can make being visually creative an absolute chore.

108
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Characters are a little easier because I mainly rely on emotion and expression, which I contangibly feel,

109
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
but landscapes I find pretty difficult.

110
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Another suggestion from a creative friend of mine is that maybe my artistic ability developed as a result of having the lack of images in my head.

111
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Maybe translating from hand to canvas is my way to channel ideas that otherwise I wouldn't have been able to construct in my head.

112
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I don't know. It's still a bit of a mystery.

113
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Instead of leaving this video on a rather defeated note, especially for any of you watching this that may have only just realized that you also suffer from aphantasia

114
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:04,000
and are missing out on this rich, vibrant mind's eye world, I am working on a technique that may help me visualize and may help you too.

115
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And it's called image streaming.

116
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And it kind of involves you closing your eyes and rapidly describing whatever pops into your head,

117
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
which is pretty straightforward for those of you that can see images in your head, no matter what the level of clarity.

118
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
But for those of you that are completely blind in the mind's eye, like me,

119
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,000
you have to kind of concentrate on your closed eyelids and try to see or invent shapes from the blackness.

120
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
If you notice when you close your eyes, the darkness isn't completely uniform.

121
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You'll see blotches or speckles and you've just got to concentrate on these.

122
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And over time, you may start to be able to imagine actual shapes within these blotches.

123
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
And these have the potential to come images that you imagine.

124
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I've included a link in the description to a blog post from a photographer that managed to cure his aphantasia,

125
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
and he tells it better than me.

126
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
But it's not all doom and gloom.

127
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Learning that I have aphantasia has also been pretty liberating for me.

128
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Because now, rather than sitting there for hours trying to visualize a landscape I'm trying to draw and failing miserably,

129
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,000
and as a result beating myself up for being an incapable artist, I can now take alternative approaches.

130
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I could quickly mock up the depth of a scene with 3D software,

131
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
so that I'm not straining my brain to generate an idea that simply won't appear visually.

132
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You know, I can help my mind with external cues.

133
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Another interesting aspect is that I do dream vividly,

134
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
and I know I'm seeing images because I can recall them in the same way that I do with memories,

135
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
which are both curiously always in third person, which is kind of weird.

136
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
But once I'm out of the dream, I just can't replay the visuals.

137
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Only the experience remains and the memories of the specific details, but I know it happened in my dream.

138
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Actually, it's interesting that despite my imagery being close to non-existent while I'm conscious,

139
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
my senses of replicating sound, touch, smell, and taste in my mind is actually pretty vivid.

140
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
So I may not actually have full aphantasia.

141
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Maybe this means I can fix it.

142
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It does give me hope that one day I will be able to visualize again.

143
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I've got to make part two, right? We all want a happy ending for me.

144
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I'm hoping that this video has not only been enlightening for those of you that can visualize already,

145
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
you know, to not take it for granted, but also for those that can't imagine pictures

146
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
or even see in black and white or can't just struggle with this on a daily basis like I have,

147
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
you are not alone and you can work around it.

148
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Somehow, against many odds, I've managed to make a successful career out of my artistic ability,

149
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
despite a lack of a conscious mind's eye.

150
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:48,000
So let this be a lesson to any of you trying to make it in the creative world, thinking you can't do it.

151
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You know, sometimes it is just down to absolute persistence and hard work,

152
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
even in the face of huge difficulty and multiple failures.

153
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I now know I can support myself and work with what I have rather than fighting against myself constantly

154
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
if I'm never able to cure it, that is.

155
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Not being able to visualize is a massive bummer, but it's not necessarily held me back.

156
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Regardless of whether I'm able to fix it, and you know, I really hope I will,

157
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
but I know that I can still pursue my artistic goals,

158
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:27,000
but I'm just going to have to give my mind that extra helping hand along with a lot of patience.

159
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:34,000
So look out for future opportunities because I'm armed with inner insight now and not of the visual kind.

160
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Thank you for watching and thank you for supporting me.

161
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I'm really enjoying putting out my YouTube content as hard as it is around work,

162
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
but look forward to some more videos coming soon.

163
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
And also, live streaming on Twitch, that's going to be a thing soon.

164
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
So thanks a lot and I'll speak to you later.
