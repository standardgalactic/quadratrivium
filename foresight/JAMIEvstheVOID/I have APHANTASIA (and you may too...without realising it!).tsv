0	3000	Let's do something a little against the grain.
3000	7000	I'd like to kick this video off with a quick little visual experiment.
7000	15000	So sit back, relax, close your eyes if you want to, and I want you to think of an apple.
15000	19000	So you're thinking of this apple in your mind. Where is this apple?
19000	25000	Is it floating in space? Is it suspended on a tree? Is it in your hand? Is it in a fruit bowl?
25000	31000	Are you seeing it in first person? Does it look like it has a stalk or a leaf attached?
31000	38000	Now imagine changing colour of that apple. How does it feel? Can you imagine that? How shiny is it?
38000	41000	Can you rotate it 180 degrees in your mind?
41000	47000	Can you put it, say, in different lighting settings, like if it was in daytime, put it in a dark nighttime setting?
47000	50000	What would it look like if you took a bite out of it?
50000	57000	Try to make these images in your head as bright and vivid as you can, and hold it there. Really see it.
57000	62000	Okay, if you did close your eyes you can open them now, although you may have missed out on some sick animation.
62000	65000	No, you didn't, don't worry, you didn't miss much.
65000	76000	Okay, so on a scale of 0 to 10, 0 representing seeing absolutely no image in your head, and 10 being absolutely vivid, almost like it were real.
76000	79000	So, where do you personally fall on this scale?
79000	83000	Giving you time to think or an answer.
83000	85000	Alright, if you survived that.
85000	96000	I ran this experiment with friends and colleagues. Admittedly, most of them are creative people as I work in the creative industry, and they all fell around the 8 to 10 mark.
96000	98000	So, that's pretty vivid.
98000	106000	Many of them stating that the image in their head was so clear, it could be real. Even superimposed into reality if they wanted to.
106000	109000	Oh boy, here come the top of comments.
109000	111000	I was chatting to an old colleague and friend of mine.
111000	118000	He's now living in Vancouver and working for a super cool company, often associated with dinosaurs and space.
118000	119000	Very jealous.
119000	128000	And even though his strengths are in the technical side rather than artistic, he said he can even create detailed 3D blueprints in his mind.
128000	131000	Also, hi Dave, you big nerd.
131000	139000	Alright, so you'd think the average person would be around, you know, 4 to 6 give or take on the visual clarity spectrum.
139000	146000	Four shadowing aside, I'm showing you a little intrigue to know where I fall on the scale as a highly artistic and creative individual.
146000	150000	You know, I mean, it's clearly a 9 to 10 for me, right?
150000	155000	Oh, congratulations, you solved my visualization puzzle.
155000	156000	Not.
157000	166000	If only mine was a 9, heck, I'd even take a 1 because I don't see anything.
166000	168000	My mind is blank.
168000	170000	I'm at zero.
170000	175000	And I only found out that this wasn't normal a few weeks ago.
175000	177000	Imagine that.
177000	182000	It's not funny because it's actually quite traumatizing.
182000	191000	It's called aphantasia, and it was first described by Francis Galton in back, well, not too long ago actually, in 1880.
191000	194000	And it's been pretty much unstudied up until 2005.
194000	197000	This is really recent, folks.
197000	207000	I'm not sure if I was born with it or whether it's been due to trauma or induced growing up or, but for whatever reason, I can't see images in my mind.
207000	211000	And knowing this now, it's kind of flipped my view on the world.
211000	215000	All right, to quell those crying out fake news, you can draw from memory.
215000	218000	Well, yeah, I have memories.
218000	220000	I identify images.
220000	223000	How else would I recognize the people I know and love?
223000	225000	How would I know the way home from work?
225000	230000	How would I know how to recognize raisins instead of mistaking them for chocolate chips?
230000	231000	What?
231000	234000	That is crucial knowledge, and you can't convince me otherwise.
234000	239000	Raisins are obviously a construct from the depths of the underworld, sent to torture us.
239000	241000	Okay, maybe that's just me.
241000	243000	I really don't like raisins.
243000	251000	But it's so bizarre how a mind like mine can function compared to someone that can actually generate images in their head.
251000	255000	I literally can't imagine what it's like.
255000	256000	Literally.
256000	263000	To put what this is like in perspective for those of you that can visualize in your mind, let's return to the Apple example.
263000	268000	Based on strong visualizers I've spoken to, the image seems to be there in your mind
268000	274000	and you can probably add to the level of detail by focusing more now, you know, concentrating.
274000	281000	For me, being unable to actually picture the Apple in my head, I have to rely on factual details alone
281000	285000	and the connections I've made to the object in the first place.
285000	290000	I know what the color green is, but I can't see it in my head.
290000	294000	So you can see kind of how my mind compensates for the lack of imagery
294000	300000	by relying on relationships, experiences, correlations and contrasts with the visuals or object in question.
300000	305000	To put it simply, if the brain is like a computer that can store and access data,
305000	310000	mind seemingly runs perfectly fine except for the fact that the screen is switched off.
310000	315000	Which, although I seem to have led a relatively unencumbered life without my screen,
315000	318000	at the end of the day it has gone unnoticed until now.
318000	323000	The realization of what I'm missing out on has left me feeling a little empty, to be honest.
323000	325000	Especially as a creative person.
325000	330000	Whenever I'd read self-help books that required you to visualize your ideal self
330000	336000	or even guided meditations that are asked to imagine sitting on a private beach at sunset,
336000	342000	I could understand the concept, but I couldn't believe that anybody could actually see a beach in their head.
342000	344000	It's just fantasy talk, right?
344000	347000	Speaking of fantasy, same goes for fiction novels.
347000	352000	Okay, admittedly I am dyslexic as well, but I tended to avoid them because
352000	357000	I couldn't see the appeal of reading without being able to visualize the story of the characters.
357000	362000	Avid fiction readers quite simply baffled me until now.
362000	367000	I always wanted to be one of those people that could curl up on a cozy windowsill while it was raining
367000	370000	and get lost in a good book over a good cup of coffee.
370000	374000	But now I understand why it seemed like such a fantasy to me.
375000	376000	But um...
376000	378000	Okay, I'm going. I'm out of here.
378000	385000	The only reason I finally realized that this wasn't normal was because, drumroll, I'd be going to hypnotherapy.
385000	391000	Oh no, shock horror, I have anxiety issues, just like every other YouTuber, am I right?
391000	395000	But honestly, without going into too many details, it's a lot to do with my mummy issues.
395000	397000	And that's for another video, folks.
397000	403000	Anyway, without going into too many details, the hypnotherapist was asking me to build my own room in my head.
403000	405000	A safe space, if you will.
405000	413000	But instead of relaxing me, it unsurprisingly stressed me out because I couldn't for the life of me picture this room.
413000	419000	I know elements that I'd like to see in my ideal room, like lots of plants, creative flair,
419000	424000	wooden earthy features combined with clean minimalism and a little bit of an industrial look.
424000	430000	I can list those individual elements, and I know factually what they would look like alone.
430000	432000	But I can't construct them in a scene.
432000	434000	And so you in the audience would say,
434000	440000	Okay, well that's well and dandy, but it doesn't explain why you're able to sustain a career focused on creative visuals
440000	444000	when you can't even imagine the images in your head.
444000	445000	Ha ha, got you now.
445000	453000	Yeah, I've spent the last few weeks being boggled by this too, but I have gathered some explanations.
453000	458000	First of all, it can be incredibly frustrating for me to draw.
458000	463000	Because I can't plan out what I want to draw in my head, and up until now I thought nobody could,
463000	467000	I have to rely solely on what I put down through sketching.
467000	475000	I have to do immense amounts of lines and assess what looks right or wrong and filter out the good from the bad by process of elimination.
475000	478000	It just takes a long time and it looks messy before it looks good.
478000	484000	If I'm trying to create something new and imaginative, I have to look at copious amounts of reference,
484000	490000	which you know, you should do as an artist anyway, but I can't retain any of the images in my head,
490000	494000	which can make being visually creative an absolute chore.
494000	502000	Characters are a little easier because I mainly rely on emotion and expression, which I contangibly feel,
502000	505000	but landscapes I find pretty difficult.
505000	514000	Another suggestion from a creative friend of mine is that maybe my artistic ability developed as a result of having the lack of images in my head.
514000	524000	Maybe translating from hand to canvas is my way to channel ideas that otherwise I wouldn't have been able to construct in my head.
524000	527000	I don't know. It's still a bit of a mystery.
527000	536000	Instead of leaving this video on a rather defeated note, especially for any of you watching this that may have only just realized that you also suffer from aphantasia
536000	544000	and are missing out on this rich, vibrant mind's eye world, I am working on a technique that may help me visualize and may help you too.
544000	546000	And it's called image streaming.
546000	551000	And it kind of involves you closing your eyes and rapidly describing whatever pops into your head,
551000	556000	which is pretty straightforward for those of you that can see images in your head, no matter what the level of clarity.
556000	560000	But for those of you that are completely blind in the mind's eye, like me,
560000	566000	you have to kind of concentrate on your closed eyelids and try to see or invent shapes from the blackness.
566000	571000	If you notice when you close your eyes, the darkness isn't completely uniform.
571000	575000	You'll see blotches or speckles and you've just got to concentrate on these.
575000	580000	And over time, you may start to be able to imagine actual shapes within these blotches.
580000	584000	And these have the potential to come images that you imagine.
584000	590000	I've included a link in the description to a blog post from a photographer that managed to cure his aphantasia,
590000	592000	and he tells it better than me.
592000	594000	But it's not all doom and gloom.
594000	598000	Learning that I have aphantasia has also been pretty liberating for me.
598000	605000	Because now, rather than sitting there for hours trying to visualize a landscape I'm trying to draw and failing miserably,
605000	611000	and as a result beating myself up for being an incapable artist, I can now take alternative approaches.
611000	614000	I could quickly mock up the depth of a scene with 3D software,
614000	619000	so that I'm not straining my brain to generate an idea that simply won't appear visually.
619000	622000	You know, I can help my mind with external cues.
622000	626000	Another interesting aspect is that I do dream vividly,
626000	631000	and I know I'm seeing images because I can recall them in the same way that I do with memories,
631000	636000	which are both curiously always in third person, which is kind of weird.
636000	641000	But once I'm out of the dream, I just can't replay the visuals.
641000	647000	Only the experience remains and the memories of the specific details, but I know it happened in my dream.
647000	652000	Actually, it's interesting that despite my imagery being close to non-existent while I'm conscious,
652000	658000	my senses of replicating sound, touch, smell, and taste in my mind is actually pretty vivid.
658000	662000	So I may not actually have full aphantasia.
662000	664000	Maybe this means I can fix it.
664000	668000	It does give me hope that one day I will be able to visualize again.
668000	672000	I've got to make part two, right? We all want a happy ending for me.
672000	676000	I'm hoping that this video has not only been enlightening for those of you that can visualize already,
676000	681000	you know, to not take it for granted, but also for those that can't imagine pictures
681000	686000	or even see in black and white or can't just struggle with this on a daily basis like I have,
686000	690000	you are not alone and you can work around it.
690000	698000	Somehow, against many odds, I've managed to make a successful career out of my artistic ability,
698000	701000	despite a lack of a conscious mind's eye.
701000	708000	So let this be a lesson to any of you trying to make it in the creative world, thinking you can't do it.
708000	713000	You know, sometimes it is just down to absolute persistence and hard work,
713000	716000	even in the face of huge difficulty and multiple failures.
716000	724000	I now know I can support myself and work with what I have rather than fighting against myself constantly
724000	726000	if I'm never able to cure it, that is.
726000	733000	Not being able to visualize is a massive bummer, but it's not necessarily held me back.
733000	738000	Regardless of whether I'm able to fix it, and you know, I really hope I will,
738000	741000	but I know that I can still pursue my artistic goals,
741000	747000	but I'm just going to have to give my mind that extra helping hand along with a lot of patience.
747000	754000	So look out for future opportunities because I'm armed with inner insight now and not of the visual kind.
756000	758000	Thank you for watching and thank you for supporting me.
758000	763000	I'm really enjoying putting out my YouTube content as hard as it is around work,
763000	766000	but look forward to some more videos coming soon.
766000	770000	And also, live streaming on Twitch, that's going to be a thing soon.
770000	773000	So thanks a lot and I'll speak to you later.
