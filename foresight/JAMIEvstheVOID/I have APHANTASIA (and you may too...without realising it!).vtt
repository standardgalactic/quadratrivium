00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Let's do something a little against the grain.

00:03.000 --> 00:07.000
I'd like to kick this video off with a quick little visual experiment.

00:07.000 --> 00:15.000
So sit back, relax, close your eyes if you want to, and I want you to think of an apple.

00:15.000 --> 00:19.000
So you're thinking of this apple in your mind. Where is this apple?

00:19.000 --> 00:25.000
Is it floating in space? Is it suspended on a tree? Is it in your hand? Is it in a fruit bowl?

00:25.000 --> 00:31.000
Are you seeing it in first person? Does it look like it has a stalk or a leaf attached?

00:31.000 --> 00:38.000
Now imagine changing colour of that apple. How does it feel? Can you imagine that? How shiny is it?

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
Can you rotate it 180 degrees in your mind?

00:41.000 --> 00:47.000
Can you put it, say, in different lighting settings, like if it was in daytime, put it in a dark nighttime setting?

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
What would it look like if you took a bite out of it?

00:50.000 --> 00:57.000
Try to make these images in your head as bright and vivid as you can, and hold it there. Really see it.

00:57.000 --> 01:02.000
Okay, if you did close your eyes you can open them now, although you may have missed out on some sick animation.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
No, you didn't, don't worry, you didn't miss much.

01:05.000 --> 01:16.000
Okay, so on a scale of 0 to 10, 0 representing seeing absolutely no image in your head, and 10 being absolutely vivid, almost like it were real.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
So, where do you personally fall on this scale?

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
Giving you time to think or an answer.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
Alright, if you survived that.

01:25.000 --> 01:36.000
I ran this experiment with friends and colleagues. Admittedly, most of them are creative people as I work in the creative industry, and they all fell around the 8 to 10 mark.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
So, that's pretty vivid.

01:38.000 --> 01:46.000
Many of them stating that the image in their head was so clear, it could be real. Even superimposed into reality if they wanted to.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
Oh boy, here come the top of comments.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
I was chatting to an old colleague and friend of mine.

01:51.000 --> 01:58.000
He's now living in Vancouver and working for a super cool company, often associated with dinosaurs and space.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Very jealous.

01:59.000 --> 02:08.000
And even though his strengths are in the technical side rather than artistic, he said he can even create detailed 3D blueprints in his mind.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
Also, hi Dave, you big nerd.

02:11.000 --> 02:19.000
Alright, so you'd think the average person would be around, you know, 4 to 6 give or take on the visual clarity spectrum.

02:19.000 --> 02:26.000
Four shadowing aside, I'm showing you a little intrigue to know where I fall on the scale as a highly artistic and creative individual.

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
You know, I mean, it's clearly a 9 to 10 for me, right?

02:30.000 --> 02:35.000
Oh, congratulations, you solved my visualization puzzle.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
Not.

02:37.000 --> 02:46.000
If only mine was a 9, heck, I'd even take a 1 because I don't see anything.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
My mind is blank.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
I'm at zero.

02:50.000 --> 02:55.000
And I only found out that this wasn't normal a few weeks ago.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
Imagine that.

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
It's not funny because it's actually quite traumatizing.

03:02.000 --> 03:11.000
It's called aphantasia, and it was first described by Francis Galton in back, well, not too long ago actually, in 1880.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
And it's been pretty much unstudied up until 2005.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
This is really recent, folks.

03:17.000 --> 03:27.000
I'm not sure if I was born with it or whether it's been due to trauma or induced growing up or, but for whatever reason, I can't see images in my mind.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
And knowing this now, it's kind of flipped my view on the world.

03:31.000 --> 03:35.000
All right, to quell those crying out fake news, you can draw from memory.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
Well, yeah, I have memories.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
I identify images.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
How else would I recognize the people I know and love?

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
How would I know the way home from work?

03:45.000 --> 03:50.000
How would I know how to recognize raisins instead of mistaking them for chocolate chips?

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
What?

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
That is crucial knowledge, and you can't convince me otherwise.

03:54.000 --> 03:59.000
Raisins are obviously a construct from the depths of the underworld, sent to torture us.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
Okay, maybe that's just me.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
I really don't like raisins.

04:03.000 --> 04:11.000
But it's so bizarre how a mind like mine can function compared to someone that can actually generate images in their head.

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
I literally can't imagine what it's like.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
Literally.

04:16.000 --> 04:23.000
To put what this is like in perspective for those of you that can visualize in your mind, let's return to the Apple example.

04:23.000 --> 04:28.000
Based on strong visualizers I've spoken to, the image seems to be there in your mind

04:28.000 --> 04:34.000
and you can probably add to the level of detail by focusing more now, you know, concentrating.

04:34.000 --> 04:41.000
For me, being unable to actually picture the Apple in my head, I have to rely on factual details alone

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
and the connections I've made to the object in the first place.

04:45.000 --> 04:50.000
I know what the color green is, but I can't see it in my head.

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
So you can see kind of how my mind compensates for the lack of imagery

04:54.000 --> 05:00.000
by relying on relationships, experiences, correlations and contrasts with the visuals or object in question.

05:00.000 --> 05:05.000
To put it simply, if the brain is like a computer that can store and access data,

05:05.000 --> 05:10.000
mind seemingly runs perfectly fine except for the fact that the screen is switched off.

05:10.000 --> 05:15.000
Which, although I seem to have led a relatively unencumbered life without my screen,

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
at the end of the day it has gone unnoticed until now.

05:18.000 --> 05:23.000
The realization of what I'm missing out on has left me feeling a little empty, to be honest.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
Especially as a creative person.

05:25.000 --> 05:30.000
Whenever I'd read self-help books that required you to visualize your ideal self

05:30.000 --> 05:36.000
or even guided meditations that are asked to imagine sitting on a private beach at sunset,

05:36.000 --> 05:42.000
I could understand the concept, but I couldn't believe that anybody could actually see a beach in their head.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
It's just fantasy talk, right?

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
Speaking of fantasy, same goes for fiction novels.

05:47.000 --> 05:52.000
Okay, admittedly I am dyslexic as well, but I tended to avoid them because

05:52.000 --> 05:57.000
I couldn't see the appeal of reading without being able to visualize the story of the characters.

05:57.000 --> 06:02.000
Avid fiction readers quite simply baffled me until now.

06:02.000 --> 06:07.000
I always wanted to be one of those people that could curl up on a cozy windowsill while it was raining

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
and get lost in a good book over a good cup of coffee.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
But now I understand why it seemed like such a fantasy to me.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
But um...

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
Okay, I'm going. I'm out of here.

06:18.000 --> 06:25.000
The only reason I finally realized that this wasn't normal was because, drumroll, I'd be going to hypnotherapy.

06:25.000 --> 06:31.000
Oh no, shock horror, I have anxiety issues, just like every other YouTuber, am I right?

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
But honestly, without going into too many details, it's a lot to do with my mummy issues.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
And that's for another video, folks.

06:37.000 --> 06:43.000
Anyway, without going into too many details, the hypnotherapist was asking me to build my own room in my head.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
A safe space, if you will.

06:45.000 --> 06:53.000
But instead of relaxing me, it unsurprisingly stressed me out because I couldn't for the life of me picture this room.

06:53.000 --> 06:59.000
I know elements that I'd like to see in my ideal room, like lots of plants, creative flair,

06:59.000 --> 07:04.000
wooden earthy features combined with clean minimalism and a little bit of an industrial look.

07:04.000 --> 07:10.000
I can list those individual elements, and I know factually what they would look like alone.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
But I can't construct them in a scene.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
And so you in the audience would say,

07:14.000 --> 07:20.000
Okay, well that's well and dandy, but it doesn't explain why you're able to sustain a career focused on creative visuals

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
when you can't even imagine the images in your head.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
Ha ha, got you now.

07:25.000 --> 07:33.000
Yeah, I've spent the last few weeks being boggled by this too, but I have gathered some explanations.

07:33.000 --> 07:38.000
First of all, it can be incredibly frustrating for me to draw.

07:38.000 --> 07:43.000
Because I can't plan out what I want to draw in my head, and up until now I thought nobody could,

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
I have to rely solely on what I put down through sketching.

07:47.000 --> 07:55.000
I have to do immense amounts of lines and assess what looks right or wrong and filter out the good from the bad by process of elimination.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
It just takes a long time and it looks messy before it looks good.

07:58.000 --> 08:04.000
If I'm trying to create something new and imaginative, I have to look at copious amounts of reference,

08:04.000 --> 08:10.000
which you know, you should do as an artist anyway, but I can't retain any of the images in my head,

08:10.000 --> 08:14.000
which can make being visually creative an absolute chore.

08:14.000 --> 08:22.000
Characters are a little easier because I mainly rely on emotion and expression, which I contangibly feel,

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
but landscapes I find pretty difficult.

08:25.000 --> 08:34.000
Another suggestion from a creative friend of mine is that maybe my artistic ability developed as a result of having the lack of images in my head.

08:34.000 --> 08:44.000
Maybe translating from hand to canvas is my way to channel ideas that otherwise I wouldn't have been able to construct in my head.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
I don't know. It's still a bit of a mystery.

08:47.000 --> 08:56.000
Instead of leaving this video on a rather defeated note, especially for any of you watching this that may have only just realized that you also suffer from aphantasia

08:56.000 --> 09:04.000
and are missing out on this rich, vibrant mind's eye world, I am working on a technique that may help me visualize and may help you too.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
And it's called image streaming.

09:06.000 --> 09:11.000
And it kind of involves you closing your eyes and rapidly describing whatever pops into your head,

09:11.000 --> 09:16.000
which is pretty straightforward for those of you that can see images in your head, no matter what the level of clarity.

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
But for those of you that are completely blind in the mind's eye, like me,

09:20.000 --> 09:26.000
you have to kind of concentrate on your closed eyelids and try to see or invent shapes from the blackness.

09:26.000 --> 09:31.000
If you notice when you close your eyes, the darkness isn't completely uniform.

09:31.000 --> 09:35.000
You'll see blotches or speckles and you've just got to concentrate on these.

09:35.000 --> 09:40.000
And over time, you may start to be able to imagine actual shapes within these blotches.

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
And these have the potential to come images that you imagine.

09:44.000 --> 09:50.000
I've included a link in the description to a blog post from a photographer that managed to cure his aphantasia,

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
and he tells it better than me.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
But it's not all doom and gloom.

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
Learning that I have aphantasia has also been pretty liberating for me.

09:58.000 --> 10:05.000
Because now, rather than sitting there for hours trying to visualize a landscape I'm trying to draw and failing miserably,

10:05.000 --> 10:11.000
and as a result beating myself up for being an incapable artist, I can now take alternative approaches.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
I could quickly mock up the depth of a scene with 3D software,

10:14.000 --> 10:19.000
so that I'm not straining my brain to generate an idea that simply won't appear visually.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
You know, I can help my mind with external cues.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
Another interesting aspect is that I do dream vividly,

10:26.000 --> 10:31.000
and I know I'm seeing images because I can recall them in the same way that I do with memories,

10:31.000 --> 10:36.000
which are both curiously always in third person, which is kind of weird.

10:36.000 --> 10:41.000
But once I'm out of the dream, I just can't replay the visuals.

10:41.000 --> 10:47.000
Only the experience remains and the memories of the specific details, but I know it happened in my dream.

10:47.000 --> 10:52.000
Actually, it's interesting that despite my imagery being close to non-existent while I'm conscious,

10:52.000 --> 10:58.000
my senses of replicating sound, touch, smell, and taste in my mind is actually pretty vivid.

10:58.000 --> 11:02.000
So I may not actually have full aphantasia.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Maybe this means I can fix it.

11:04.000 --> 11:08.000
It does give me hope that one day I will be able to visualize again.

11:08.000 --> 11:12.000
I've got to make part two, right? We all want a happy ending for me.

11:12.000 --> 11:16.000
I'm hoping that this video has not only been enlightening for those of you that can visualize already,

11:16.000 --> 11:21.000
you know, to not take it for granted, but also for those that can't imagine pictures

11:21.000 --> 11:26.000
or even see in black and white or can't just struggle with this on a daily basis like I have,

11:26.000 --> 11:30.000
you are not alone and you can work around it.

11:30.000 --> 11:38.000
Somehow, against many odds, I've managed to make a successful career out of my artistic ability,

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
despite a lack of a conscious mind's eye.

11:41.000 --> 11:48.000
So let this be a lesson to any of you trying to make it in the creative world, thinking you can't do it.

11:48.000 --> 11:53.000
You know, sometimes it is just down to absolute persistence and hard work,

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
even in the face of huge difficulty and multiple failures.

11:56.000 --> 12:04.000
I now know I can support myself and work with what I have rather than fighting against myself constantly

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
if I'm never able to cure it, that is.

12:06.000 --> 12:13.000
Not being able to visualize is a massive bummer, but it's not necessarily held me back.

12:13.000 --> 12:18.000
Regardless of whether I'm able to fix it, and you know, I really hope I will,

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
but I know that I can still pursue my artistic goals,

12:21.000 --> 12:27.000
but I'm just going to have to give my mind that extra helping hand along with a lot of patience.

12:27.000 --> 12:34.000
So look out for future opportunities because I'm armed with inner insight now and not of the visual kind.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
Thank you for watching and thank you for supporting me.

12:38.000 --> 12:43.000
I'm really enjoying putting out my YouTube content as hard as it is around work,

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
but look forward to some more videos coming soon.

12:46.000 --> 12:50.000
And also, live streaming on Twitch, that's going to be a thing soon.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
So thanks a lot and I'll speak to you later.
