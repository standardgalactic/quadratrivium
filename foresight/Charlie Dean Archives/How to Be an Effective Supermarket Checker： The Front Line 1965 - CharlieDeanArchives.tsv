30000	53280	Some people call this a war, war or not, one thing is sure, a daily battle is being waged
53280	65200	in supermarkets all over this country, a battle for the customer's dollar.
65200	69520	If a store is to make a profit in the face of today's stiff competition, everyone in
69520	77080	it must give his full effort.
77080	91280	But like any battle, victory in this conflict is finally won or lost on the front line.
91280	98880	With literally millions of dollars at stake, success is measured in pennies.
98880	108000	The checker plays a key role in this daily struggle.
108000	112400	Methods of handling groceries and customers may vary from store to store, but the basic
112400	114760	objectives are the same.
114760	119620	Check the customer's purchases accurately, ring them up correctly and collect the money
119620	121120	for the store.
121120	123760	And there's more, much more.
123760	129000	Only no job in a supermarket affects the store's success more than that of a checker.
129000	133200	Her every action reflects on the store and its entire staff.
133200	138120	She is a shopper's last and often only personal contact with the store.
138120	141640	To the customer, the checker is very important.
141640	147040	Her responsibilities are great and varied, but with all of them, one of a checker's primary
147040	149960	obligation is to keep the traffic moving.
150560	154720	Sometimes a checkout lane begins to resemble a crowded thoroughfare.
154720	157720	When jams up form, they're hard to get rid of.
157720	160200	And the analogy goes much deeper.
160200	165640	The colors of traffic control, red, yellow and green, have a real relationship to the
165640	167680	science of good checking.
167680	171720	Naturally, the idea is to keep things moving, to keep that green light glowing.
179960	187400	Good checking really boils down to the same essentials, no matter what type of equipment
187400	189120	your store uses.
189120	194080	To demonstrate these essentials, here are three outstanding checkers, all former queens
194080	196920	in the Checker of the Year competition.
196920	200800	Meet Ruth Bussey at the B&B Supermarkets in Tampa, Florida.
200800	206200	A checker for 10 years now, Ruth was chosen International Checker of the Year in 1964.
210960	216240	Next to Ruth is Pat Hilton of the Alpha Beta Supermarkets in La Habra, California.
216240	221440	Pat has 18 years experience and was International Checker of the Year in 1962.
225120	227240	And this is Rose Scolovino.
227240	232200	Rose has four years experience and works for Star Market in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
232200	236280	Rose was Checker of the Year in 1963.
236280	238800	And here's another checker you should meet.
238800	243360	Miss Jones is not a checker of the year, but she hopes to be someday.
243360	249040	She's an intelligent, hard-working, charming young lady, still a little new to her job,
249040	251040	but learning fast.
251040	255440	Like most of us, she could learn a lot just by watching experts perform.
260040	266800	The first thing I do when I start the day is get my cash from the head checker.
266800	271160	In a busy week, $5,000 or more may pass through my register.
271160	275720	Handling it accurately is one of my biggest responsibilities.
275720	281800	Once I've got my money counted out and correct, I put my register through a daily inspection.
281800	283200	Is there enough tape?
283200	285360	Is it dated correctly?
285360	287480	Is the register plugged in?
287480	289560	Is it zeroed?
289560	294440	I always check supplies now when there's time to replace needed items.
294440	296360	Are there enough bags to last?
296400	299200	I don't want to run out later.
299200	303040	I always try to remember that I'm dealing with food.
303040	306000	That means that my stand has to be spotless.
306000	310960	My merchandise racks must also be in good order before the day begins.
310960	315560	The last thing I check is the most important, myself.
315560	318840	Appearance means a lot on this job.
318840	323000	Thorough preparation is a mark of every good checker.
323000	326840	When the day begins, Ms. Jones is ready.
326840	330800	The idea is to keep that green light on, to keep the lane moving.
330800	334800	But that's not as easy as it may sound.
334800	337800	There are times when caution is necessary.
337800	362800	And sometimes, sometimes you must stop altogether, the important things knowing the difference.
362800	376000	But so long as you observe the basics, things will keep moving smoothly.
376000	383000	Watch an expert.
383000	387160	The first order of business is to greet the customer.
387160	389560	Then comes an important moment of caution.
389560	391680	Is the bottom of the cart empty?
391680	396040	I always make certain there are no missed items that might get through unchecked.
396040	400280	And ring this up is a signal to myself that I've checked the cart.
400280	404280	And most importantly, I keep it pleasant in matter of fact.
404280	408320	No customer likes to think she is suspected of shoplifting.
408320	412480	Ring up the right price and press the right department key.
412480	416240	These keys are important to the store's records and planning.
416240	418840	Checkers are bookkeepers, too.
418840	422040	Multiple priced items should be checked together.
422040	429200	Try to hold the first items in this group until they can all be checked through at once.
429200	431480	Multiple pricing used to frighten me.
431480	433680	I'm not much on fractions.
433680	440560	Now when I see an incomplete group like this, I just slow down a second to be sure I've got the price right.
440560	444600	This is what the fraction chart is for, and I use it.
444600	448720	There's no such thing as an almost right in this business.
448720	451880	If I overcharge, I cheat the customer.
451880	455040	If I undercharge, I'm unfair to the store.
455040	458400	Fractions mean you charge the next penny.
458400	460920	Dropping the fraction can be costly.
460920	464680	It might well represent the entire profit on this order.
464680	466600	Here's another pricing problem.
466600	469600	A price smeared beyond recognition.
469600	471520	How do you decipher it?
474640	477360	This is one time I stop everything.
477360	478840	I don't guess.
478840	483880	I ring for my supervisor and set the smeared item aside until she comes.
483880	488000	In the meantime, I can continue putting the rest of the order through.
488000	496280	Although I study the prices and know the specials, I'm always on the lookout for certain booby traps.
496280	506480	Some items, like soups, have different prices for different types.
506520	510440	Others have identical package designs, but different prices.
510440	517960	For instance, pineapple chunks at 39 cents and crushed pineapple at 33 cents.
517960	522680	It sometimes seems like a lot of worry about a few pennies, but think a minute.
522680	526840	With a store's profit margin of about one and a quarter percent,
526840	533680	a checker error of only 30 cents means that about $25 worth of groceries must be sold
533680	536960	before the store regains the loss.
536960	538960	It's more than just pennies.
538960	542640	It's a question of your store's success or failure.
542640	547080	And once the order is checked, there are still some important jobs to be done.
547080	550600	Handling money is one of a checker's greatest responsibilities
550600	554080	and sometimes one of the most difficult.
564680	571680	Handling money is largely a matter of knowing the rules and following them to the letter.
574680	579680	There are many systems, but generally your stores will be similar to this.
579680	583680	Defer coupons until the order is paid for.
583680	587680	Know your store's policy on check cashing and follow it closely.
588680	595680	As you accept the customer's money, call the out-of-amount, such as $12.38 out of $20.
595680	602680	Put the check or bill onto the slab and count the change to yourself, then to your customer.
602680	605680	And never forget, thank you.
605680	612680	Lastly, put the money from the slab into the register and never leave your position with your register open.
613680	617680	Coupons are simple if you handle them right.
617680	625680	After the customer has paid the regular price for her order, check her coupons against the purchased items.
625680	630680	Sometimes people haven't actually bought the goods specified on the coupon.
630680	638680	Total the coupons, take the cash and refund it to the customer, remembering to do so with a smile.
639680	645680	This system makes your job easier and lets the customer know her coupons were credited.
645680	648680	Trading stamps are simple too.
648680	653680	Be accurate and remember, they are money.
653680	658680	Giving a customer more than she is entitled to costs the store.
658680	666680	The final job of the checker is one that most checkers like least, but it's also one of the most important.
689680	703680	I guess I can't say I've ever enjoyed packing an order, but I know how much depends on it.
703680	706680	It's one part of the store the customer takes home with her.
706680	710680	Beginning with the right size bag, I pack heavy to light.
710680	715680	That's also the way I'd send the order through if a bagger were working with me.
715680	721680	After a solid base is made up with cans and other heavy items, I build up the sides with flats,
721680	725680	putting glass and other fragile items in the center for protection.
725680	730680	Meat, frozen foods and ice cream should always be wrapped separately.
733680	736680	Finally, light crushables go on top.
737680	743680	Knowing the fundamentals makes the job easier and helps you to do it better.
743680	748680	But there's one area of checking where each girl brings something special to her job,
748680	751680	where there are no universal guidelines.
751680	755680	Personality is something every good checker develops on her own.
755680	759680	She learns to communicate a comfortable pleasantness to her customers,
759680	762680	making them feel that the store regards them as something special.
762680	765680	A smile is always part of the uniform.
765680	767680	The job is easier when you do it right
767680	771680	and people are generally nicer to deal with when you treat them right.
774680	777680	Checking is never going to be an easy job.
777680	779680	The responsibilities are too great.
779680	783680	Just consider how much work a good checker does on a busy day,
783680	788680	putting through up to 360 orders, checking some 7,000 separate items.
788680	792680	You have to be good and develop good habits such as maintaining space
792680	795680	between unchecked items and those that have been checked.
795680	797680	These girls are among the best.
797680	801680	It takes skill and practice to get this good.
801680	803680	And a lot of effort.
803680	805680	But the basics are simple.
805680	809680	Slow down when the situation calls for extra care.
809680	813680	Stop completely on those few occasions that require it
813680	816680	and keep the flow moving the rest of the time,
816680	819680	swiftly, accurately and pleasantly.
824680	829680	Remembering the fundamentals may make Miss Jones a checker of the year one day.
829680	832680	It might do the same for you.
837680	840680	This battle is won on the front line.
840680	845680	It's here that the customer has her last important contact with the store.
845680	850680	To a large extent, a checker's actions determine whether a shopper will be back.
850680	852680	It's a difficult job at times,
852680	857680	but learning the skills we've seen demonstrated will help assure that it's done right
857680	860680	and will make your task much easier.
863680	866680	In your store, you are a vital member of the team.
866680	868680	By always observing the fundamentals,
868680	872680	you'll be doing your part on the front line.
