1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:53,280
Some people call this a war, war or not, one thing is sure, a daily battle is being waged

2
00:00:53,280 --> 00:01:05,200
in supermarkets all over this country, a battle for the customer's dollar.

3
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,520
If a store is to make a profit in the face of today's stiff competition, everyone in

4
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:17,080
it must give his full effort.

5
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:31,280
But like any battle, victory in this conflict is finally won or lost on the front line.

6
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:38,880
With literally millions of dollars at stake, success is measured in pennies.

7
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:48,000
The checker plays a key role in this daily struggle.

8
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,400
Methods of handling groceries and customers may vary from store to store, but the basic

9
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,760
objectives are the same.

10
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:59,620
Check the customer's purchases accurately, ring them up correctly and collect the money

11
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,120
for the store.

12
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,760
And there's more, much more.

13
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:09,000
Only no job in a supermarket affects the store's success more than that of a checker.

14
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,200
Her every action reflects on the store and its entire staff.

15
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,120
She is a shopper's last and often only personal contact with the store.

16
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,640
To the customer, the checker is very important.

17
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:27,040
Her responsibilities are great and varied, but with all of them, one of a checker's primary

18
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,960
obligation is to keep the traffic moving.

19
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,720
Sometimes a checkout lane begins to resemble a crowded thoroughfare.

20
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,720
When jams up form, they're hard to get rid of.

21
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,200
And the analogy goes much deeper.

22
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:45,640
The colors of traffic control, red, yellow and green, have a real relationship to the

23
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,680
science of good checking.

24
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,720
Naturally, the idea is to keep things moving, to keep that green light glowing.

25
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:07,400
Good checking really boils down to the same essentials, no matter what type of equipment

26
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,120
your store uses.

27
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,080
To demonstrate these essentials, here are three outstanding checkers, all former queens

28
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,920
in the Checker of the Year competition.

29
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,800
Meet Ruth Bussey at the B&B Supermarkets in Tampa, Florida.

30
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,200
A checker for 10 years now, Ruth was chosen International Checker of the Year in 1964.

31
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:36,240
Next to Ruth is Pat Hilton of the Alpha Beta Supermarkets in La Habra, California.

32
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:41,440
Pat has 18 years experience and was International Checker of the Year in 1962.

33
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,240
And this is Rose Scolovino.

34
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:52,200
Rose has four years experience and works for Star Market in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

35
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,280
Rose was Checker of the Year in 1963.

36
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,800
And here's another checker you should meet.

37
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:03,360
Miss Jones is not a checker of the year, but she hopes to be someday.

38
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,040
She's an intelligent, hard-working, charming young lady, still a little new to her job,

39
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,040
but learning fast.

40
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,440
Like most of us, she could learn a lot just by watching experts perform.

41
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:26,800
The first thing I do when I start the day is get my cash from the head checker.

42
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,160
In a busy week, $5,000 or more may pass through my register.

43
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,720
Handling it accurately is one of my biggest responsibilities.

44
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:41,800
Once I've got my money counted out and correct, I put my register through a daily inspection.

45
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,200
Is there enough tape?

46
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,360
Is it dated correctly?

47
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,480
Is the register plugged in?

48
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,560
Is it zeroed?

49
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,440
I always check supplies now when there's time to replace needed items.

50
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,360
Are there enough bags to last?

51
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,200
I don't want to run out later.

52
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:03,040
I always try to remember that I'm dealing with food.

53
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,000
That means that my stand has to be spotless.

54
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,960
My merchandise racks must also be in good order before the day begins.

55
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,560
The last thing I check is the most important, myself.

56
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,840
Appearance means a lot on this job.

57
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,000
Thorough preparation is a mark of every good checker.

58
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,840
When the day begins, Ms. Jones is ready.

59
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,800
The idea is to keep that green light on, to keep the lane moving.

60
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,800
But that's not as easy as it may sound.

61
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,800
There are times when caution is necessary.

62
00:05:37,800 --> 00:06:02,800
And sometimes, sometimes you must stop altogether, the important things knowing the difference.

63
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:16,000
But so long as you observe the basics, things will keep moving smoothly.

64
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Watch an expert.

65
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,160
The first order of business is to greet the customer.

66
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,560
Then comes an important moment of caution.

67
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,680
Is the bottom of the cart empty?

68
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,040
I always make certain there are no missed items that might get through unchecked.

69
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:40,280
And ring this up is a signal to myself that I've checked the cart.

70
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:44,280
And most importantly, I keep it pleasant in matter of fact.

71
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:48,320
No customer likes to think she is suspected of shoplifting.

72
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:52,480
Ring up the right price and press the right department key.

73
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:56,240
These keys are important to the store's records and planning.

74
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,840
Checkers are bookkeepers, too.

75
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:02,040
Multiple priced items should be checked together.

76
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:09,200
Try to hold the first items in this group until they can all be checked through at once.

77
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,480
Multiple pricing used to frighten me.

78
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,680
I'm not much on fractions.

79
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:20,560
Now when I see an incomplete group like this, I just slow down a second to be sure I've got the price right.

80
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,600
This is what the fraction chart is for, and I use it.

81
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,720
There's no such thing as an almost right in this business.

82
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,880
If I overcharge, I cheat the customer.

83
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,040
If I undercharge, I'm unfair to the store.

84
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,400
Fractions mean you charge the next penny.

85
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,920
Dropping the fraction can be costly.

86
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,680
It might well represent the entire profit on this order.

87
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,600
Here's another pricing problem.

88
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,600
A price smeared beyond recognition.

89
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,520
How do you decipher it?

90
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,360
This is one time I stop everything.

91
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,840
I don't guess.

92
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:03,880
I ring for my supervisor and set the smeared item aside until she comes.

93
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:08,000
In the meantime, I can continue putting the rest of the order through.

94
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:16,280
Although I study the prices and know the specials, I'm always on the lookout for certain booby traps.

95
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:26,480
Some items, like soups, have different prices for different types.

96
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,440
Others have identical package designs, but different prices.

97
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:37,960
For instance, pineapple chunks at 39 cents and crushed pineapple at 33 cents.

98
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:42,680
It sometimes seems like a lot of worry about a few pennies, but think a minute.

99
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:46,840
With a store's profit margin of about one and a quarter percent,

100
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:53,680
a checker error of only 30 cents means that about $25 worth of groceries must be sold

101
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,960
before the store regains the loss.

102
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,960
It's more than just pennies.

103
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,640
It's a question of your store's success or failure.

104
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,080
And once the order is checked, there are still some important jobs to be done.

105
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,600
Handling money is one of a checker's greatest responsibilities

106
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,080
and sometimes one of the most difficult.

107
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:31,680
Handling money is largely a matter of knowing the rules and following them to the letter.

108
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:39,680
There are many systems, but generally your stores will be similar to this.

109
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,680
Defer coupons until the order is paid for.

110
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,680
Know your store's policy on check cashing and follow it closely.

111
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:55,680
As you accept the customer's money, call the out-of-amount, such as $12.38 out of $20.

112
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:02,680
Put the check or bill onto the slab and count the change to yourself, then to your customer.

113
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,680
And never forget, thank you.

114
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:12,680
Lastly, put the money from the slab into the register and never leave your position with your register open.

115
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,680
Coupons are simple if you handle them right.

116
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:25,680
After the customer has paid the regular price for her order, check her coupons against the purchased items.

117
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,680
Sometimes people haven't actually bought the goods specified on the coupon.

118
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:38,680
Total the coupons, take the cash and refund it to the customer, remembering to do so with a smile.

119
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:45,680
This system makes your job easier and lets the customer know her coupons were credited.

120
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,680
Trading stamps are simple too.

121
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,680
Be accurate and remember, they are money.

122
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,680
Giving a customer more than she is entitled to costs the store.

123
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:06,680
The final job of the checker is one that most checkers like least, but it's also one of the most important.

124
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:43,680
I guess I can't say I've ever enjoyed packing an order, but I know how much depends on it.

125
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,680
It's one part of the store the customer takes home with her.

126
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,680
Beginning with the right size bag, I pack heavy to light.

127
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:55,680
That's also the way I'd send the order through if a bagger were working with me.

128
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:01,680
After a solid base is made up with cans and other heavy items, I build up the sides with flats,

129
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,680
putting glass and other fragile items in the center for protection.

130
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,680
Meat, frozen foods and ice cream should always be wrapped separately.

131
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,680
Finally, light crushables go on top.

132
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:23,680
Knowing the fundamentals makes the job easier and helps you to do it better.

133
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,680
But there's one area of checking where each girl brings something special to her job,

134
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,680
where there are no universal guidelines.

135
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,680
Personality is something every good checker develops on her own.

136
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,680
She learns to communicate a comfortable pleasantness to her customers,

137
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,680
making them feel that the store regards them as something special.

138
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,680
A smile is always part of the uniform.

139
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,680
The job is easier when you do it right

140
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,680
and people are generally nicer to deal with when you treat them right.

141
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,680
Checking is never going to be an easy job.

142
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,680
The responsibilities are too great.

143
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,680
Just consider how much work a good checker does on a busy day,

144
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,680
putting through up to 360 orders, checking some 7,000 separate items.

145
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:12,680
You have to be good and develop good habits such as maintaining space

146
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,680
between unchecked items and those that have been checked.

147
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,680
These girls are among the best.

148
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,680
It takes skill and practice to get this good.

149
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,680
And a lot of effort.

150
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,680
But the basics are simple.

151
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,680
Slow down when the situation calls for extra care.

152
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,680
Stop completely on those few occasions that require it

153
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,680
and keep the flow moving the rest of the time,

154
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,680
swiftly, accurately and pleasantly.

155
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:49,680
Remembering the fundamentals may make Miss Jones a checker of the year one day.

156
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,680
It might do the same for you.

157
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,680
This battle is won on the front line.

158
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:05,680
It's here that the customer has her last important contact with the store.

159
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,680
To a large extent, a checker's actions determine whether a shopper will be back.

160
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,680
It's a difficult job at times,

161
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:17,680
but learning the skills we've seen demonstrated will help assure that it's done right

162
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,680
and will make your task much easier.

163
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,680
In your store, you are a vital member of the team.

164
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,680
By always observing the fundamentals,

165
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,680
you'll be doing your part on the front line.
