Checking Charlie Dean Archives/How to Be an Effective Supermarket Checkerï¼š The Front Line 1965 - CharlieDeanArchives.txt
1. **Importance of Checker Accuracy**: A checker error of just 30 cents can set back a store's profit by about $25. Thus, accuracy is crucial in handling money and checking items.

2. **Handling Money**: Follow the store's policy closely when handling money. Call out the amount tendered, count change to yourself first, then to the customer, and always thank them.

3. **Coupons and Rebates**: Process coupons only after the initial payment is made, ensuring that the items purchased match those on the coupon. Refund any excess change with a smile.

4. **Trading Stamps**: Treat trading stamps as you would cash because they are equivalent in value to the store.

5. **Packing Orders**: Use the right size bag, pack from heavy to light items, wrap perishables separately, and ensure glass and fragile items are well protected.

6. **Personality**: A checker's personality is key to providing a pleasant customer experience, which can greatly influence customer satisfaction and loyalty.

7. **Consistency and Efficiency**: Maintain space between checked and unchecked items, keep the flow moving while being accurate, and slow down only when extra care is needed.

8. **Team Contribution**: As a checker, you are part of the store's team, and your role on the front line significantly impacts customer satisfaction and the store's success.

9. **Developing Skills**: By mastering the fundamentals of checking, you can make your job easier, more efficient, and contribute positively to the store's operations and customer relations.
