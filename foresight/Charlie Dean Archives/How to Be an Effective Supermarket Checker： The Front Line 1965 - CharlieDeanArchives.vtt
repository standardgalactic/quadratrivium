00:30.000 --> 00:53.280
Some people call this a war, war or not, one thing is sure, a daily battle is being waged

00:53.280 --> 01:05.200
in supermarkets all over this country, a battle for the customer's dollar.

01:05.200 --> 01:09.520
If a store is to make a profit in the face of today's stiff competition, everyone in

01:09.520 --> 01:17.080
it must give his full effort.

01:17.080 --> 01:31.280
But like any battle, victory in this conflict is finally won or lost on the front line.

01:31.280 --> 01:38.880
With literally millions of dollars at stake, success is measured in pennies.

01:38.880 --> 01:48.000
The checker plays a key role in this daily struggle.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.400
Methods of handling groceries and customers may vary from store to store, but the basic

01:52.400 --> 01:54.760
objectives are the same.

01:54.760 --> 01:59.620
Check the customer's purchases accurately, ring them up correctly and collect the money

01:59.620 --> 02:01.120
for the store.

02:01.120 --> 02:03.760
And there's more, much more.

02:03.760 --> 02:09.000
Only no job in a supermarket affects the store's success more than that of a checker.

02:09.000 --> 02:13.200
Her every action reflects on the store and its entire staff.

02:13.200 --> 02:18.120
She is a shopper's last and often only personal contact with the store.

02:18.120 --> 02:21.640
To the customer, the checker is very important.

02:21.640 --> 02:27.040
Her responsibilities are great and varied, but with all of them, one of a checker's primary

02:27.040 --> 02:29.960
obligation is to keep the traffic moving.

02:30.560 --> 02:34.720
Sometimes a checkout lane begins to resemble a crowded thoroughfare.

02:34.720 --> 02:37.720
When jams up form, they're hard to get rid of.

02:37.720 --> 02:40.200
And the analogy goes much deeper.

02:40.200 --> 02:45.640
The colors of traffic control, red, yellow and green, have a real relationship to the

02:45.640 --> 02:47.680
science of good checking.

02:47.680 --> 02:51.720
Naturally, the idea is to keep things moving, to keep that green light glowing.

02:59.960 --> 03:07.400
Good checking really boils down to the same essentials, no matter what type of equipment

03:07.400 --> 03:09.120
your store uses.

03:09.120 --> 03:14.080
To demonstrate these essentials, here are three outstanding checkers, all former queens

03:14.080 --> 03:16.920
in the Checker of the Year competition.

03:16.920 --> 03:20.800
Meet Ruth Bussey at the B&B Supermarkets in Tampa, Florida.

03:20.800 --> 03:26.200
A checker for 10 years now, Ruth was chosen International Checker of the Year in 1964.

03:30.960 --> 03:36.240
Next to Ruth is Pat Hilton of the Alpha Beta Supermarkets in La Habra, California.

03:36.240 --> 03:41.440
Pat has 18 years experience and was International Checker of the Year in 1962.

03:45.120 --> 03:47.240
And this is Rose Scolovino.

03:47.240 --> 03:52.200
Rose has four years experience and works for Star Market in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

03:52.200 --> 03:56.280
Rose was Checker of the Year in 1963.

03:56.280 --> 03:58.800
And here's another checker you should meet.

03:58.800 --> 04:03.360
Miss Jones is not a checker of the year, but she hopes to be someday.

04:03.360 --> 04:09.040
She's an intelligent, hard-working, charming young lady, still a little new to her job,

04:09.040 --> 04:11.040
but learning fast.

04:11.040 --> 04:15.440
Like most of us, she could learn a lot just by watching experts perform.

04:20.040 --> 04:26.800
The first thing I do when I start the day is get my cash from the head checker.

04:26.800 --> 04:31.160
In a busy week, $5,000 or more may pass through my register.

04:31.160 --> 04:35.720
Handling it accurately is one of my biggest responsibilities.

04:35.720 --> 04:41.800
Once I've got my money counted out and correct, I put my register through a daily inspection.

04:41.800 --> 04:43.200
Is there enough tape?

04:43.200 --> 04:45.360
Is it dated correctly?

04:45.360 --> 04:47.480
Is the register plugged in?

04:47.480 --> 04:49.560
Is it zeroed?

04:49.560 --> 04:54.440
I always check supplies now when there's time to replace needed items.

04:54.440 --> 04:56.360
Are there enough bags to last?

04:56.400 --> 04:59.200
I don't want to run out later.

04:59.200 --> 05:03.040
I always try to remember that I'm dealing with food.

05:03.040 --> 05:06.000
That means that my stand has to be spotless.

05:06.000 --> 05:10.960
My merchandise racks must also be in good order before the day begins.

05:10.960 --> 05:15.560
The last thing I check is the most important, myself.

05:15.560 --> 05:18.840
Appearance means a lot on this job.

05:18.840 --> 05:23.000
Thorough preparation is a mark of every good checker.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.840
When the day begins, Ms. Jones is ready.

05:26.840 --> 05:30.800
The idea is to keep that green light on, to keep the lane moving.

05:30.800 --> 05:34.800
But that's not as easy as it may sound.

05:34.800 --> 05:37.800
There are times when caution is necessary.

05:37.800 --> 06:02.800
And sometimes, sometimes you must stop altogether, the important things knowing the difference.

06:02.800 --> 06:16.000
But so long as you observe the basics, things will keep moving smoothly.

06:16.000 --> 06:23.000
Watch an expert.

06:23.000 --> 06:27.160
The first order of business is to greet the customer.

06:27.160 --> 06:29.560
Then comes an important moment of caution.

06:29.560 --> 06:31.680
Is the bottom of the cart empty?

06:31.680 --> 06:36.040
I always make certain there are no missed items that might get through unchecked.

06:36.040 --> 06:40.280
And ring this up is a signal to myself that I've checked the cart.

06:40.280 --> 06:44.280
And most importantly, I keep it pleasant in matter of fact.

06:44.280 --> 06:48.320
No customer likes to think she is suspected of shoplifting.

06:48.320 --> 06:52.480
Ring up the right price and press the right department key.

06:52.480 --> 06:56.240
These keys are important to the store's records and planning.

06:56.240 --> 06:58.840
Checkers are bookkeepers, too.

06:58.840 --> 07:02.040
Multiple priced items should be checked together.

07:02.040 --> 07:09.200
Try to hold the first items in this group until they can all be checked through at once.

07:09.200 --> 07:11.480
Multiple pricing used to frighten me.

07:11.480 --> 07:13.680
I'm not much on fractions.

07:13.680 --> 07:20.560
Now when I see an incomplete group like this, I just slow down a second to be sure I've got the price right.

07:20.560 --> 07:24.600
This is what the fraction chart is for, and I use it.

07:24.600 --> 07:28.720
There's no such thing as an almost right in this business.

07:28.720 --> 07:31.880
If I overcharge, I cheat the customer.

07:31.880 --> 07:35.040
If I undercharge, I'm unfair to the store.

07:35.040 --> 07:38.400
Fractions mean you charge the next penny.

07:38.400 --> 07:40.920
Dropping the fraction can be costly.

07:40.920 --> 07:44.680
It might well represent the entire profit on this order.

07:44.680 --> 07:46.600
Here's another pricing problem.

07:46.600 --> 07:49.600
A price smeared beyond recognition.

07:49.600 --> 07:51.520
How do you decipher it?

07:54.640 --> 07:57.360
This is one time I stop everything.

07:57.360 --> 07:58.840
I don't guess.

07:58.840 --> 08:03.880
I ring for my supervisor and set the smeared item aside until she comes.

08:03.880 --> 08:08.000
In the meantime, I can continue putting the rest of the order through.

08:08.000 --> 08:16.280
Although I study the prices and know the specials, I'm always on the lookout for certain booby traps.

08:16.280 --> 08:26.480
Some items, like soups, have different prices for different types.

08:26.520 --> 08:30.440
Others have identical package designs, but different prices.

08:30.440 --> 08:37.960
For instance, pineapple chunks at 39 cents and crushed pineapple at 33 cents.

08:37.960 --> 08:42.680
It sometimes seems like a lot of worry about a few pennies, but think a minute.

08:42.680 --> 08:46.840
With a store's profit margin of about one and a quarter percent,

08:46.840 --> 08:53.680
a checker error of only 30 cents means that about $25 worth of groceries must be sold

08:53.680 --> 08:56.960
before the store regains the loss.

08:56.960 --> 08:58.960
It's more than just pennies.

08:58.960 --> 09:02.640
It's a question of your store's success or failure.

09:02.640 --> 09:07.080
And once the order is checked, there are still some important jobs to be done.

09:07.080 --> 09:10.600
Handling money is one of a checker's greatest responsibilities

09:10.600 --> 09:14.080
and sometimes one of the most difficult.

09:24.680 --> 09:31.680
Handling money is largely a matter of knowing the rules and following them to the letter.

09:34.680 --> 09:39.680
There are many systems, but generally your stores will be similar to this.

09:39.680 --> 09:43.680
Defer coupons until the order is paid for.

09:43.680 --> 09:47.680
Know your store's policy on check cashing and follow it closely.

09:48.680 --> 09:55.680
As you accept the customer's money, call the out-of-amount, such as $12.38 out of $20.

09:55.680 --> 10:02.680
Put the check or bill onto the slab and count the change to yourself, then to your customer.

10:02.680 --> 10:05.680
And never forget, thank you.

10:05.680 --> 10:12.680
Lastly, put the money from the slab into the register and never leave your position with your register open.

10:13.680 --> 10:17.680
Coupons are simple if you handle them right.

10:17.680 --> 10:25.680
After the customer has paid the regular price for her order, check her coupons against the purchased items.

10:25.680 --> 10:30.680
Sometimes people haven't actually bought the goods specified on the coupon.

10:30.680 --> 10:38.680
Total the coupons, take the cash and refund it to the customer, remembering to do so with a smile.

10:39.680 --> 10:45.680
This system makes your job easier and lets the customer know her coupons were credited.

10:45.680 --> 10:48.680
Trading stamps are simple too.

10:48.680 --> 10:53.680
Be accurate and remember, they are money.

10:53.680 --> 10:58.680
Giving a customer more than she is entitled to costs the store.

10:58.680 --> 11:06.680
The final job of the checker is one that most checkers like least, but it's also one of the most important.

11:29.680 --> 11:43.680
I guess I can't say I've ever enjoyed packing an order, but I know how much depends on it.

11:43.680 --> 11:46.680
It's one part of the store the customer takes home with her.

11:46.680 --> 11:50.680
Beginning with the right size bag, I pack heavy to light.

11:50.680 --> 11:55.680
That's also the way I'd send the order through if a bagger were working with me.

11:55.680 --> 12:01.680
After a solid base is made up with cans and other heavy items, I build up the sides with flats,

12:01.680 --> 12:05.680
putting glass and other fragile items in the center for protection.

12:05.680 --> 12:10.680
Meat, frozen foods and ice cream should always be wrapped separately.

12:13.680 --> 12:16.680
Finally, light crushables go on top.

12:17.680 --> 12:23.680
Knowing the fundamentals makes the job easier and helps you to do it better.

12:23.680 --> 12:28.680
But there's one area of checking where each girl brings something special to her job,

12:28.680 --> 12:31.680
where there are no universal guidelines.

12:31.680 --> 12:35.680
Personality is something every good checker develops on her own.

12:35.680 --> 12:39.680
She learns to communicate a comfortable pleasantness to her customers,

12:39.680 --> 12:42.680
making them feel that the store regards them as something special.

12:42.680 --> 12:45.680
A smile is always part of the uniform.

12:45.680 --> 12:47.680
The job is easier when you do it right

12:47.680 --> 12:51.680
and people are generally nicer to deal with when you treat them right.

12:54.680 --> 12:57.680
Checking is never going to be an easy job.

12:57.680 --> 12:59.680
The responsibilities are too great.

12:59.680 --> 13:03.680
Just consider how much work a good checker does on a busy day,

13:03.680 --> 13:08.680
putting through up to 360 orders, checking some 7,000 separate items.

13:08.680 --> 13:12.680
You have to be good and develop good habits such as maintaining space

13:12.680 --> 13:15.680
between unchecked items and those that have been checked.

13:15.680 --> 13:17.680
These girls are among the best.

13:17.680 --> 13:21.680
It takes skill and practice to get this good.

13:21.680 --> 13:23.680
And a lot of effort.

13:23.680 --> 13:25.680
But the basics are simple.

13:25.680 --> 13:29.680
Slow down when the situation calls for extra care.

13:29.680 --> 13:33.680
Stop completely on those few occasions that require it

13:33.680 --> 13:36.680
and keep the flow moving the rest of the time,

13:36.680 --> 13:39.680
swiftly, accurately and pleasantly.

13:44.680 --> 13:49.680
Remembering the fundamentals may make Miss Jones a checker of the year one day.

13:49.680 --> 13:52.680
It might do the same for you.

13:57.680 --> 14:00.680
This battle is won on the front line.

14:00.680 --> 14:05.680
It's here that the customer has her last important contact with the store.

14:05.680 --> 14:10.680
To a large extent, a checker's actions determine whether a shopper will be back.

14:10.680 --> 14:12.680
It's a difficult job at times,

14:12.680 --> 14:17.680
but learning the skills we've seen demonstrated will help assure that it's done right

14:17.680 --> 14:20.680
and will make your task much easier.

14:23.680 --> 14:26.680
In your store, you are a vital member of the team.

14:26.680 --> 14:28.680
By always observing the fundamentals,

14:28.680 --> 14:32.680
you'll be doing your part on the front line.
