Processing Overview for Meth Meth Method
============================
Checking Meth Meth Method/WTF is Cobol.txt
🎓 **Learning Outcome:** You've successfully created a COBOL program that multiplies a series of numbers (up to four in this case) by initializing the product variable to one and iteratively multiplying it by each new factor entered.

🚀 **Program Functionality:**
1. The program accepts up to four integers from the user.
2. Each integer is stored as a factor.
3. The product starts at one (initialized before the loop).
4. The program multiplies the current product by the current factor.
5. This process repeats for each factor until all factors have been included in the calculation.
6. The final result, which is the product of all factors, is then displayed.

🛠️ **Code Improvements:**
- Fixed an off-by-one error by correctly initializing and incrementing the `step current` variable within the loop.
- Used the `perform times` statement to execute the calculation loop a specified number of times (two, in this case).
- Updated the metadata of the program to accurately reflect the use of COBOL language constructs like `accept`, `perform until`, and `multiply`.

💼 **Real-World Application:**
This program could be used as a simple calculator for various applications, such as in banking for compound interest calculations or in retail for discount calculations.

🎉 **Next Steps:**
- Further refine the code to handle more than four factors if needed.
- Add error handling to ensure that only valid inputs (integers) are accepted.
- Optimize memory usage and performance based on specific requirements.

🌐 **Sharing the Code:**
The program has been shared in a public GitHub repository for others to learn from or use as a starting point for their own COBOL projects.

👏 **Accomplishment:**
You've demonstrated the ability to write a COBOL program, which is a valuable skill, especially for legacy system maintenance and modernization projects. Keep practicing, and you'll become even more proficient in COBOL!
