1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,500
In my previous video, I used commonly available materials to do photolithography on silicon.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:10,800
Today, I'm going to combine photolithography and one of my all-time favorite chemical reactions

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,500
to create the conductive metal wires used to connect devices in an integrated circuit.

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,500
I've already talked at length about the development of the integrated circuit

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,000
and how humanity went from being able to produce a single transistor

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
to billions of transistors on the same chip.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,500
However, billions of unconnected transistors on their own won't do anything

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,000
unless we can wire them together in a circuit.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,500
A cheap, reliable, and scalable method for producing metal wires on the surface of a silicon chip

10
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,000
is therefore a top priority in integrated circuit fabrication.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,500
To accomplish this task, we want to deposit a layer of solid conductive metal

12
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,500
such as aluminum, copper, silver, or gold,

13
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,000
and then use photolithography to remove the metal that we don't want,

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,500
leaving behind a bunch of thin wires that connect individual devices together in a circuit.

15
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,500
There are two common ways to accomplish this task.

16
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,500
The first is an etching process.

17
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:10,000
In this process, you deposit a layer of metal onto the chip and then apply photoresist over that.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,500
Then you expose and develop the resist, which removes portions of the photoresist layer.

19
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,500
Then you immerse the chip in an etching solution that dissolves the exposed metal,

20
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:22,000
leaving behind metal only where the photoresist is still protecting it.

21
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,500
Then you immerse the chip in a solvent that dissolves the photoresist,

22
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,000
which gives you your final product.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The second method is called lift-off.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,500
In this method, you put the photoresist layer down first.

25
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:38,000
You again expose and develop the resist, which removes portions of the photoresist layer.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,500
Then you deposit metal on top of that.

27
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,000
Notice that the metal layer sticks to the whole surface,

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,500
regardless of whether the surface is the chip itself or the photoresist layer above.

29
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:51,000
Then you immerse the chip in a solvent that dissolves the resist.

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,500
As the resist dissolves, any metal on top lifts off the chip and is carried away.

31
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:01,000
The metal that was in direct contact with the chip is unaffected by the solvent and sticks around,

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
giving you your final product.

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,500
Now, regardless of which method we choose,

34
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:11,500
we still need some way of depositing an even layer of metal on the surface of a silicon wafer.

35
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,500
In modern semiconductor fabs,

36
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,500
metal layers are deposited onto the surface of the chip in a process called thermal evaporation.

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,500
This process is carried out in a vacuum chamber,

38
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,000
and a small sample of metal is heated until it vaporizes.

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Just as boiling water produces steam,

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
vaporizing metal produces a cloud of metal particles,

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
which condenses or deposits onto the surface of a chip in a smooth uniform layer.

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
This process is nice because it's reliable, controllable, and clean.

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The downside of this process for the hobbyist

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
is that it requires the construction of a dedicated machine

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
with expensive parts in order to make it work.

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It would be nice if a method were available

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
to produce conductive layers on a chip without the need

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
to spend a bunch of time and money building a thermal evaporator.

49
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I sat down and thought about the problem for a while,

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
and realized there might be an easier way.

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Whatever method we use needs to meet the following requirements.

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
First, the layer needs to be conductive.

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Traces ideally should be less than 10 ohms or so.

54
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,500
Second, the layer needs to be durable.

55
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,500
Traces shouldn't fall off or deteriorate over time.

56
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,500
Third, the process needs to be reliable.

57
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,500
We don't want to have to try over and over again to get good results.

58
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,500
Fourth, the process needs to be quick.

59
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,500
We don't want the step to take too long,

60
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,500
or it will dramatically slow down the whole fabrication process.

61
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,500
Fifth, the process needs to be compatible with photolithography.

62
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,500
Otherwise, we won't be able to create accurate connections to devices on the chip.

63
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,500
And last, the process needs to be as cheap and easy as possible.

64
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,500
Otherwise, it's better to just spend the time building the thermal evaporator.

65
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,500
My first idea was to use conductive paint.

66
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,500
I think most hobbyists who have played with circuits have probably seen stuff like this.

67
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:58,500
Little pens that dispense ink that contains enough graphite or silver particles to conduct electricity,

68
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,500
allowing you to literally draw circuits on paper.

69
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:06,500
Most conductive paint is designed to be applied to paper and not glass, silicon dioxide.

70
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,500
However, I did find this product from Permatex.

71
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,500
It's a conductive paint used to repair vehicle defoggers.

72
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:17,500
If you've never noticed them, they are those little metal wires you see on your rear window.

73
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:21,500
Electric current is passed through them and it causes those wires to heat up,

74
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,500
which heats the glass and defogs your window.

75
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:28,500
What's nice about this product is that it's specifically formulated to stick to glass.

76
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,500
It's a bit expensive, about $20 for this tiny bottle.

77
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:38,500
I tested it on a microscope slide and used tape to make a small line about 5 centimeters long

78
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,500
and a couple of millimeters wide.

79
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,500
I tested its conductivity with a meter and I was pleased by the results.

80
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,500
However, I realized a major problem.

81
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,500
This paint is not compatible with our photolithography process.

82
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,500
I exposed the paint to acetone, which is used to strip photoresist, and it came right off.

83
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,500
I also tested it by exposing it to developer solution,

84
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:08,500
and while it was a little bit more resilient, it still weakened the paint to such a degree that it rubbed off quite easily.

85
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,500
I could have tested other paints, but I'm fairly confident that other types of conductive paint

86
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,500
will suffer the same problems with solvent resistance that we saw here.

87
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,500
This means that this method is probably not suitable for making chips.

88
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,500
I also briefly considered conductive epoxy.

89
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:30,500
Unfortunately, all of the conductive epoxy I found required long cure times, hours or days instead of minutes.

90
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:36,500
It also can't be easily etched away, and I suspect it will probably not work too well with liftoff either.

91
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,500
So it's probably not very compatible with our photolithography process.

92
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,500
Moving on.

93
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,500
A chemical process was my next idea.

94
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,500
One of the most common chemistry demos in high school is the silver mirror reaction,

95
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,500
which produces a thin layer of silver on glass.

96
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,500
The silver mirror reaction requires the following chemicals.

97
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,500
Sodium hydroxide and ammonia are readily available from hardware stores,

98
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,500
and silver nitrate and glucose are easy enough to find online.

99
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:06,500
Rather than working out the math myself, I'm going to use the same formulation I found in a chemistry demo kit.

100
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,500
It calls for the following solutions.

101
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,500
First, we prepare a 0.6 molar solution of silver nitrate.

102
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:17,500
That corresponds to 1 gram of silver nitrate and 10 milliliters of distilled water.

103
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,500
The solution is light sensitive, so I'm storing it in an amber vial.

104
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,500
Do your best to keep it out of direct sunlight.

105
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:27,500
Next, we need a 2.5 molar solution of sodium hydroxide.

106
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:32,500
That is, coincidentally, 1 gram of sodium hydroxide and 10 milliliters of water.

107
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:36,500
Make sure to add the sodium hydroxide to water and not the other way around.

108
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:41,500
Sodium hydroxide can heat up a lot when it dissolves, so go slow and be careful.

109
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,500
Now we need a 2 molar ammonia solution.

110
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:50,500
This ammonia is 10%, which is about 6 molar, so I used 1 part ammonia and 2 parts water for my solution.

111
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,500
Lastly, we need glucose.

112
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,500
Note that you cannot use regular table sugar for this reaction.

113
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,500
It has to be glucose specifically.

114
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:04,500
We need a 10% glucose solution, which is 1 gram of glucose plus 10 milliliters of water.

115
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,500
Shake until dissolved.

116
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:13,500
I've labeled each vial and also labeled a pipette corresponding to each chemical, so I don't accidentally contaminate them.

117
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,500
Alright, I think I'm ready to see if this works.

118
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,500
The procedure is simple.

119
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:24,500
We start with 5 drops of the silver nitrate solution, then we add 3 drops of the sodium hydroxide solution.

120
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:31,500
This causes the silver nitrate to react and form silver oxide, which forms this dark brown precipitate.

121
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:37,500
Next, we add 15 drops of the ammonia solution and swirl or shake the vial.

122
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,500
This forms an ammonia complex that dissolves back into the solution.

123
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:45,500
Last, we add 2 drops of the glucose solution.

124
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,500
This is actually my first time seeing this reaction happen in person.

125
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:57,500
The solution started out clear, but quickly developed a slight dark tint as small amounts of silver precipitated out of solution.

126
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:05,500
I slowly twisted the vial in my hands in order to distribute the small amount of solution as evenly as possible on the walls of the vial.

127
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:11,500
After about a minute, it became obvious that some kind of coating was developing on the inner wall of the vial,

128
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:16,500
and after about 3 minutes, that coating became a brilliant silver mirror.

129
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,500
I was honestly impressed it was this easy.

130
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,500
I ran the test several more times and never had any issues with the reliability.

131
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,500
It just works.

132
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:31,500
Once I was satisfied that the solution was used up, I needed to deal with the liquid remaining in the vial.

133
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,500
Apparently, you should make sure not to let the solution dry out,

134
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:39,500
as it is possible for it to form silver fulminate, an explosive compound.

135
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:44,500
Now, I seriously doubt the amount I have is any danger,

136
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:48,500
but just to be safe, I'm going to pour it into a solution of sodium chloride.

137
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,500
Once that's done, it can be safely disposed of.

138
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,500
And there we have it.

139
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,500
A nice silver coating on the inside of our vial.

140
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,500
Since it's opaque, it's got to be at least 100 nanometers or so thick,

141
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,500
but I have no real way to measure its thickness accurately.

142
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:10,500
Now, silver is a fantastic electrical conductor, but this silver layer isn't solid.

143
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,500
It's actually tons and tons of tiny particles all stuck together.

144
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:18,500
It should be electrically conductive though, so let's measure that.

145
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:24,500
Good news, I'm reading a resistance of less than one ohm on this piece of glass, so it's definitely conductive.

146
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,500
Alright, now let's see if we can get a good layer on this silicon chip.

147
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,500
I grew an oxide on it and made sure it was nice and clean.

148
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:36,500
I prepared the silver solution and added it to the vial along with the chip.

149
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,500
I shook the vial to distribute the solution in an attempt to evenly coat the chip,

150
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:45,500
and, once again, waited about three minutes for the silver mirror to form.

151
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:50,500
Once that was done, I extracted the chip and washed it with distilled water and dried it.

152
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:54,500
Wow, I clearly damaged the chip from all that shaking.

153
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,500
It's missing chunks out of the corners, but at least it's coated relatively evenly,

154
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,500
and the layer is indeed conductive.

155
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:06,500
The only problem is that the coating is not adhering super well.

156
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:11,500
It's pretty easy to rub the silver layer off with something like a paper towel.

157
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,500
Maybe we can make it stronger by annealing it in the tube furnace.

158
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:19,500
I put the chip in my quartz boat and slid it into the furnace a few times at various temperatures,

159
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:24,500
from 500 Celsius to 1000 Celsius to see if it had any effect.

160
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:30,500
It's hard to tell, but I think the higher temperatures did improve the durability slightly,

161
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:35,500
but when I went back and tested the resistance, the silver layer was no longer conductive.

162
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:42,500
I found this odd because silver is a noble metal and doesn't really react with oxygen or nitrogen in the air,

163
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,500
even at high temperatures.

164
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:48,500
Unlike metals such as iron or aluminum, which readily react with air to form oxides,

165
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:53,500
silver compounds actually decompose at high temperatures back into silver metal.

166
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,500
So it's not really likely that this layer is anything but pure silver,

167
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,500
so why is it no longer conductive?

168
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,500
I scratched my head for a while trying to figure this one out,

169
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,500
and eventually found this research paper that gave me the answer.

170
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:13,500
Thin silver layers, when heated, beat up and separate into a bunch of tiny silver dots.

171
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,500
They are still elemental silver, but since they are no longer connected to each other,

172
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,500
they cannot conduct electricity.

173
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:24,500
This effect happens even if the silver is heated to temperatures well below its melting point,

174
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:30,500
which means that we cannot use the furnace to anneal the layer without risking the layer becoming non-conductive.

175
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:35,500
This is a bit of a disappointment, but as long as we're careful not to scratch the silver layer,

176
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,500
it should still be durable enough for our purposes.

177
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:43,500
Now that I was sure I could use this chemical method to create a usable silver layer,

178
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:48,500
I charged ahead and attempted to combine it with photolithography in the liftoff process described earlier.

179
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:53,500
This is the one where you apply the photoresist first, and then the silver layer on top of that.

180
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,500
I applied the photoresist to the chip using the laminator,

181
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:02,500
and then exposed and developed it using the same mask from the previous video.

182
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:07,500
Once I verified the chip was clean, I went ahead and prepared the silver solution as before.

183
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:14,500
This time, though, I used twice as much, just to make it a little easier to swirl and ensure it actually gets all over the chip.

184
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:20,500
I mixed the silver nitrate, sodium hydroxide, and ammonia solutions first, then put the chip in,

185
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,500
then added the glucose to start the reaction.

186
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:29,500
It was right about here that I started realizing that something went terribly, terribly wrong.

187
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:37,500
Three minutes later, I once again got a beautiful silver mirror and extracted the chip when I realized I had made a serious mistake.

188
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,500
The photoresist was completely gone.

189
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,500
What happened?

190
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,500
Here's the problem.

191
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:49,500
The developer solution is sodium carbonate, and if we measure the pH at somewhere between 10 and 11,

192
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:54,500
I measured the pH of the silver mirror solution and found that it had a pH of at least 12,

193
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:59,500
which is no surprise considering that sodium hydroxide and ammonia are strongly alkaline.

194
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:04,500
We know from the previous video that basic solutions will damage the photoresist over time,

195
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:10,500
and it looks like the pH of the silver solution is high enough to cause the photoresist layer to disintegrate completely.

196
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:15,500
I had a moment of panic because I thought this meant that the whole project was dead in the water.

197
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:20,500
Then I realized that the situation wasn't quite as dire as I had feared.

198
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,500
Yes, the silver plating solution is incompatible with the photoresist,

199
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:29,500
but that just means that we can't apply the silver after we apply the photoresist.

200
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,500
We can still apply the silver before.

201
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:36,500
This means that we can't use liftoff, but we can use the etching method.

202
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:41,500
In order to make this method work, we'll need to develop and test an etching solution for silver.

203
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,500
Fortunately, I have just the thing.

204
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,500
These are the vials left over from all the previous reactions.

205
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:51,500
I can use them to test any etching solutions we come up with.

206
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:55,500
Speaking of etching, we sort of backed ourselves into a bit of a corner.

207
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:02,500
You see, the fact that silver is a noble metal means that silver much prefers to be an element instead of a compound.

208
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:06,500
This is why our silver mirror reaction is so easy.

209
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:12,500
It takes very little persuasion to convert the dissolved silver ions back into elemental silver metal.

210
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:19,500
However, this means that the reverse, converting the silver metal into silver ions, is hard.

211
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,500
Even strong acids like sulfuric and hydrochloric acid alone won't do the job.

212
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:29,500
The usual method for dissolving silver is to use nitric acid, but I don't have any of that.

213
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:33,500
Fortunately, there is a cheat code when it comes to acids.

214
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:39,500
You can add a small amount of peroxide to an acid to allow it to react with metals that it normally wouldn't be able to.

215
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:46,500
I added about 10 milliliters of concentrated sulfuric acid to about 10 milliliters of 12% hydrogen peroxide,

216
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,500
making a slightly diluted version of something called piranha etch.

217
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:56,500
This stuff will react aggressively with organic material, so it's important to keep yourself safe and protected.

218
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:01,500
I poured the piranha solution into the silver vial and waited.

219
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:09,500
It does indeed strip the silver off, but it's not exactly what I'd call a nice or even process.

220
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:14,500
It seems like the silver is sort of flaking off in an uncontrolled manner.

221
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:21,500
I tried the same thing with hydrochloric acid and peroxide, hoping for better results, but the outcome was exactly the same.

222
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,500
Just this slow flaking of the silver layer.

223
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,500
It took a bit of thinking, but I realized the problem.

224
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:32,500
In order for the silver etching process to work, you need two different things.

225
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:40,500
First, you need the etchant to react with the silver, and second, you need the product of the reaction to be soluble.

226
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:49,500
You see, when we reacted the silver layer with sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid, the silver converted to silver sulfate and silver chloride respectively.

227
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:56,500
Both of these compounds are insoluble in water, so the surface silver atoms reacted, but they didn't go into solution.

228
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:01,500
Instead, they just stayed there, blocking the remaining silver atoms from reacting.

229
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:10,500
If instead we chose an acid that produced a soluble silver compound, the silver would react and then dissolve, going into solution and exposing the remaining silver,

230
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:16,500
allowing the subsequent layers to react, eventually removing all of the silver in a reliable fashion.

231
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,500
This is why nitric acid is the preferred etchant for silver.

232
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,500
Here's a list of silver compounds sorted by solubility.

233
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:31,500
You can see here that silver nitrate has an insane solubility of almost 3 kilograms per liter of water.

234
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:38,500
The next on the list is silver fluoride, so it's possible that we could use HF to edge the silver.

235
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:43,500
However, we really shouldn't be using HF for anything we don't absolutely have to.

236
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:51,500
Well, the next compound on the list is silver acetate, which is just about two orders of magnitude less soluble,

237
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,500
about 11 grams per liter of water.

238
00:16:54,500 --> 00:17:02,500
Still, this might just be enough, and better yet, silver acetate is formed by acetic acid and peroxide,

239
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:07,500
which is a much, much less scary combo than hydrofluoric acid and peroxide.

240
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:11,500
I stole some vinegar from the kitchen, which is about 5% acetic acid,

241
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:18,500
and I mixed it with an equal amount of 12% peroxide and poured it into one of the silver vials and waited.

242
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,500
Hey, that's more like it.

243
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:29,500
The etching process is much quicker and a lot more consistent than with either the sulfuric or hydrochloric acid.

244
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:36,500
Just goes to show that sometimes the best solution is not the strongest chemical, but the right chemical.

245
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:43,500
I used my hot plate to warm the vinegar peroxide solution to about 50 Celsius and the results were even better.

246
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,500
The silver layer was stripped bare in only a few seconds.

247
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,500
Looks like we've found a suitable etchant for silver.

248
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:54,500
Now that we have our etchant, let's try the photolithography again using the etching process.

249
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:58,500
I once again prepared the silver mirror solution and added my silicon chip.

250
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:06,500
This time, to avoid damaging the chip, I'm using a narrow vial and rocking it back and forth rather than shaking it to pieces like last time.

251
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:14,500
This method has the added benefit of allowing you to see what's going on as the layer deposits, assuming you're careful and don't rotate the vial.

252
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:21,500
I rinsed and dried the chip and once again peeled the protective plastic layer off the photoresist and ran it through the laminator.

253
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:29,500
I made a new mask that is just three traces or wires of varying width to more quantitatively test the resistance of the silver layer.

254
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,500
Looks like the exposure was successful.

255
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:36,500
Now I just need to remove the final protective plastic layer from the photoresist and develop it.

256
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,500
Wait a minute, what just happened?

257
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,500
Well, there's the problem.

258
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:45,500
Instead of peeling the protective plastic layer off the photoresist,

259
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:50,500
everything, the plastic, photoresist, and silver layer, peeled completely off the chip.

260
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:55,500
It looks like the silver layer is not very well adhered to the silicon dioxide surface of the chip.

261
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:00,500
I thought this might just be a cleanliness problem, so I tried again several more times.

262
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:05,500
I tried baking the chip to remove any traces of moisture adsorbed to the surface,

263
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:13,500
as well as using piranha solution to destroy any trace of organic material like oils that might have been a problem, but nothing worked.

264
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,500
Each attempt produced the exact same results.

265
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:21,500
Now, I'm sure that some of you are yelling at your screen telling me I have to use a plasma cleaner,

266
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:26,500
and that probably would help, but sadly I don't have one.

267
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:30,500
Also, even a pristine surface wouldn't really improve things very much.

268
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:36,500
The reason for this is that silver just doesn't adhere well to silicon dioxide. Period.

269
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:43,500
This is one of the reasons that silver isn't very commonly used to make integrated circuits, even though it's the most conductive metal.

270
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,500
When the need arises and silver absolutely has to be used,

271
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:52,500
it's often deposited on top of a thin layer of something else that has better adhesion to glass.

272
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,500
Really, the main problem here is the photoresist itself.

273
00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:00,500
The photoresist I'm using is a very thin layer in between two pieces of protective plastic.

274
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:08,500
Unfortunately, though, this plastic layer is sticking to the photoresist better than the silver is sticking to the chip, causing our silver layer to delaminate.

275
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:13,500
Now, it's tempting to just remove the plastic at the start of the process,

276
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:18,500
but without the protective plastic, the photoresist will surely be destroyed when it runs through the laminator.

277
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,500
Curses.

278
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:25,500
If only the manufacturer had considered my ridiculous out-of-spec use case for their product and designed it better.

279
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:31,500
If only the plastic layer were something more slippery, something like... wait a minute.

280
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:38,500
Actually, there's nothing stopping me from replacing the clear plastic layer with a more suitable material.

281
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,500
And I know just the thing.

282
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:45,500
PTFE, or Teflon, is extremely slippery because of its carbon fluorine bonds,

283
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,500
and it's readily available as thread sealing tape.

284
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,500
Let's see if this works.

285
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:53,500
I used tape as normal to remove the first piece of plastic from the photoresist.

286
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:59,500
Then, I stuck another piece of tape directly to the edge of the photoresist and peeled the second layer of plastic off,

287
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:03,500
leaving me with the very thin, fragile resist layer only.

288
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:08,500
I placed that on top of the silver layer on a new chip and carefully applied the Teflon tape,

289
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:12,500
then used a piece of index card to encase the whole thing and ran it through the laminator.

290
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:19,500
Well, it was a little tricky, but I did manage to separate the PTFE from the photoresist without peeling the silver layer off.

291
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:23,500
I found that it helps to turn the temperature of the laminator down slightly.

292
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:28,500
Don't turn the temperature too far down, though, or you'll get bubbles like I did in this other chip.

293
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,500
This one should be fine, though.

294
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:33,500
I once again exposed the photoresist and developed it as normal.

295
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,500
Now, it's finally time to use the silver etching solution.

296
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,500
Man, that is so satisfying.

297
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,500
The results are excellent.

298
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:47,500
Now that the silver layer is gone, we just need to remove the remaining photoresist with acetone.

299
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:54,500
This is the last step, and I'm basically holding my breath at this point, hoping I don't run into any more problems.

300
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:59,500
Fortunately, the photoresist layer separated and the silver remained undamaged.

301
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,500
I checked the resistance of each of the traces with a multimeter.

302
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:10,500
It looks like the narrow trace is about 20 ohms, the medium trace is about 10 ohms, and the fat trace is 5 ohms,

303
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,500
which I think is acceptable for now.

304
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:18,500
I might be able to tweak the process and get a thicker silver layer for better conductivity, but I'm not going to bother right now.

305
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:22,500
What is bothering me is the durability of the silver layer.

306
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:28,500
The probes aren't really sharp, but they are more than enough to scrape away material from the landing pads I made.

307
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:32,500
You know what? I think I have just the thing to fix this.

308
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,500
Remember the conductive paint from earlier?

309
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:40,500
Well, it may not work with photoresist, but I can still paint it on manually to protect the pads a little.

310
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:44,500
That was a little sloppy, but nothing an exacto knife can't fix.

311
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,500
Let's see if that makes an improvement.

312
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:51,500
Well, it's not perfect, but it's clearly protecting the silver layer a little bit.

313
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:57,500
In the future, I'll have to do more tests and see if something like conductive epoxy would be a better choice for this.

314
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,500
For now, though, I'm pretty satisfied.

315
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:03,500
The last thing I want to do is test the resolution of the process.

316
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:11,500
I used the mask from the last video and ran through the same process of depositing the silver, doing the photolithography, and etching the silver away.

317
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:16,500
The results look great. I don't really see any major issues with undercutting.

318
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:22,500
I expect that the resolution of the metal layer is limited by the photolithography, which is what we want.

319
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:29,500
Well, I think I've set a record for the number of nearly insurmountable problems that I had to overcome to make this process work.

320
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,500
But work it does.

321
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:35,500
I made a bunch of copies of the chip, and the results were all pretty consistent.

322
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:40,500
I'm sure there is work to be done in the future to improve the process, but I'm going to call this here.

323
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:47,500
I'm very pleased that I was able to make metallization work using a simple chemical process that requires no fancy equipment whatsoever.

324
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:55,500
I think in the future, I'll still want to make a thermal evaporator for increased flexibility, but for now, this silvering process should suffice.

325
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,500
I just want to thank everyone for making it to the end of this video.

326
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:03,500
I also want to thank everyone who emailed me after my last video with photoresist information.

327
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:08,500
I'm making some good progress on that front, and I'm super excited to share it soon.

328
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:13,500
I also want to thank my patrons who funded this project and bought all of these random chemicals.

329
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,500
Thank you so much. I'll see you next time.
