0	5500	In my previous video, I used commonly available materials to do photolithography on silicon.
5500	10800	Today, I'm going to combine photolithography and one of my all-time favorite chemical reactions
10800	15500	to create the conductive metal wires used to connect devices in an integrated circuit.
17800	21500	I've already talked at length about the development of the integrated circuit
21500	25000	and how humanity went from being able to produce a single transistor
25000	28000	to billions of transistors on the same chip.
28000	32500	However, billions of unconnected transistors on their own won't do anything
32500	35000	unless we can wire them together in a circuit.
35000	40500	A cheap, reliable, and scalable method for producing metal wires on the surface of a silicon chip
40500	44000	is therefore a top priority in integrated circuit fabrication.
44000	48500	To accomplish this task, we want to deposit a layer of solid conductive metal
48500	51500	such as aluminum, copper, silver, or gold,
51500	55000	and then use photolithography to remove the metal that we don't want,
55000	59500	leaving behind a bunch of thin wires that connect individual devices together in a circuit.
59500	62500	There are two common ways to accomplish this task.
62500	64500	The first is an etching process.
64500	70000	In this process, you deposit a layer of metal onto the chip and then apply photoresist over that.
70000	74500	Then you expose and develop the resist, which removes portions of the photoresist layer.
74500	78500	Then you immerse the chip in an etching solution that dissolves the exposed metal,
78500	82000	leaving behind metal only where the photoresist is still protecting it.
82500	85500	Then you immerse the chip in a solvent that dissolves the photoresist,
85500	88000	which gives you your final product.
88000	90000	The second method is called lift-off.
90000	93500	In this method, you put the photoresist layer down first.
93500	98000	You again expose and develop the resist, which removes portions of the photoresist layer.
98000	100500	Then you deposit metal on top of that.
100500	103000	Notice that the metal layer sticks to the whole surface,
103000	107500	regardless of whether the surface is the chip itself or the photoresist layer above.
107500	111000	Then you immerse the chip in a solvent that dissolves the resist.
111000	116500	As the resist dissolves, any metal on top lifts off the chip and is carried away.
116500	121000	The metal that was in direct contact with the chip is unaffected by the solvent and sticks around,
121000	123000	giving you your final product.
123000	125500	Now, regardless of which method we choose,
125500	131500	we still need some way of depositing an even layer of metal on the surface of a silicon wafer.
131500	133500	In modern semiconductor fabs,
133500	138500	metal layers are deposited onto the surface of the chip in a process called thermal evaporation.
139000	141500	This process is carried out in a vacuum chamber,
141500	145000	and a small sample of metal is heated until it vaporizes.
145000	147000	Just as boiling water produces steam,
147000	150000	vaporizing metal produces a cloud of metal particles,
150000	155000	which condenses or deposits onto the surface of a chip in a smooth uniform layer.
155000	160000	This process is nice because it's reliable, controllable, and clean.
160000	162000	The downside of this process for the hobbyist
162000	165000	is that it requires the construction of a dedicated machine
165000	167000	with expensive parts in order to make it work.
167000	169000	It would be nice if a method were available
169000	172000	to produce conductive layers on a chip without the need
172000	175000	to spend a bunch of time and money building a thermal evaporator.
175000	178000	I sat down and thought about the problem for a while,
178000	180000	and realized there might be an easier way.
180000	184000	Whatever method we use needs to meet the following requirements.
184000	187000	First, the layer needs to be conductive.
187000	191000	Traces ideally should be less than 10 ohms or so.
191000	193500	Second, the layer needs to be durable.
193500	196500	Traces shouldn't fall off or deteriorate over time.
197500	200500	Third, the process needs to be reliable.
200500	203500	We don't want to have to try over and over again to get good results.
203500	206500	Fourth, the process needs to be quick.
206500	208500	We don't want the step to take too long,
208500	211500	or it will dramatically slow down the whole fabrication process.
211500	215500	Fifth, the process needs to be compatible with photolithography.
215500	219500	Otherwise, we won't be able to create accurate connections to devices on the chip.
219500	223500	And last, the process needs to be as cheap and easy as possible.
223500	227500	Otherwise, it's better to just spend the time building the thermal evaporator.
227500	229500	My first idea was to use conductive paint.
229500	233500	I think most hobbyists who have played with circuits have probably seen stuff like this.
233500	238500	Little pens that dispense ink that contains enough graphite or silver particles to conduct electricity,
238500	241500	allowing you to literally draw circuits on paper.
241500	246500	Most conductive paint is designed to be applied to paper and not glass, silicon dioxide.
246500	249500	However, I did find this product from Permatex.
249500	252500	It's a conductive paint used to repair vehicle defoggers.
252500	257500	If you've never noticed them, they are those little metal wires you see on your rear window.
257500	261500	Electric current is passed through them and it causes those wires to heat up,
261500	263500	which heats the glass and defogs your window.
263500	268500	What's nice about this product is that it's specifically formulated to stick to glass.
268500	272500	It's a bit expensive, about $20 for this tiny bottle.
272500	278500	I tested it on a microscope slide and used tape to make a small line about 5 centimeters long
278500	280500	and a couple of millimeters wide.
280500	284500	I tested its conductivity with a meter and I was pleased by the results.
284500	288500	However, I realized a major problem.
288500	292500	This paint is not compatible with our photolithography process.
292500	297500	I exposed the paint to acetone, which is used to strip photoresist, and it came right off.
297500	301500	I also tested it by exposing it to developer solution,
301500	308500	and while it was a little bit more resilient, it still weakened the paint to such a degree that it rubbed off quite easily.
308500	312500	I could have tested other paints, but I'm fairly confident that other types of conductive paint
312500	316500	will suffer the same problems with solvent resistance that we saw here.
316500	320500	This means that this method is probably not suitable for making chips.
320500	323500	I also briefly considered conductive epoxy.
323500	330500	Unfortunately, all of the conductive epoxy I found required long cure times, hours or days instead of minutes.
330500	336500	It also can't be easily etched away, and I suspect it will probably not work too well with liftoff either.
336500	340500	So it's probably not very compatible with our photolithography process.
340500	342500	Moving on.
342500	344500	A chemical process was my next idea.
344500	348500	One of the most common chemistry demos in high school is the silver mirror reaction,
348500	350500	which produces a thin layer of silver on glass.
350500	353500	The silver mirror reaction requires the following chemicals.
353500	357500	Sodium hydroxide and ammonia are readily available from hardware stores,
357500	361500	and silver nitrate and glucose are easy enough to find online.
361500	366500	Rather than working out the math myself, I'm going to use the same formulation I found in a chemistry demo kit.
366500	368500	It calls for the following solutions.
368500	372500	First, we prepare a 0.6 molar solution of silver nitrate.
372500	377500	That corresponds to 1 gram of silver nitrate and 10 milliliters of distilled water.
377500	381500	The solution is light sensitive, so I'm storing it in an amber vial.
381500	383500	Do your best to keep it out of direct sunlight.
383500	387500	Next, we need a 2.5 molar solution of sodium hydroxide.
387500	392500	That is, coincidentally, 1 gram of sodium hydroxide and 10 milliliters of water.
392500	396500	Make sure to add the sodium hydroxide to water and not the other way around.
396500	401500	Sodium hydroxide can heat up a lot when it dissolves, so go slow and be careful.
401500	404500	Now we need a 2 molar ammonia solution.
404500	410500	This ammonia is 10%, which is about 6 molar, so I used 1 part ammonia and 2 parts water for my solution.
410500	412500	Lastly, we need glucose.
412500	415500	Note that you cannot use regular table sugar for this reaction.
415500	418500	It has to be glucose specifically.
418500	424500	We need a 10% glucose solution, which is 1 gram of glucose plus 10 milliliters of water.
424500	426500	Shake until dissolved.
426500	433500	I've labeled each vial and also labeled a pipette corresponding to each chemical, so I don't accidentally contaminate them.
433500	435500	Alright, I think I'm ready to see if this works.
435500	437500	The procedure is simple.
437500	444500	We start with 5 drops of the silver nitrate solution, then we add 3 drops of the sodium hydroxide solution.
444500	451500	This causes the silver nitrate to react and form silver oxide, which forms this dark brown precipitate.
451500	457500	Next, we add 15 drops of the ammonia solution and swirl or shake the vial.
457500	461500	This forms an ammonia complex that dissolves back into the solution.
461500	465500	Last, we add 2 drops of the glucose solution.
465500	469500	This is actually my first time seeing this reaction happen in person.
469500	477500	The solution started out clear, but quickly developed a slight dark tint as small amounts of silver precipitated out of solution.
477500	485500	I slowly twisted the vial in my hands in order to distribute the small amount of solution as evenly as possible on the walls of the vial.
485500	491500	After about a minute, it became obvious that some kind of coating was developing on the inner wall of the vial,
491500	496500	and after about 3 minutes, that coating became a brilliant silver mirror.
496500	499500	I was honestly impressed it was this easy.
499500	503500	I ran the test several more times and never had any issues with the reliability.
503500	505500	It just works.
505500	511500	Once I was satisfied that the solution was used up, I needed to deal with the liquid remaining in the vial.
511500	515500	Apparently, you should make sure not to let the solution dry out,
515500	519500	as it is possible for it to form silver fulminate, an explosive compound.
519500	524500	Now, I seriously doubt the amount I have is any danger,
524500	528500	but just to be safe, I'm going to pour it into a solution of sodium chloride.
528500	531500	Once that's done, it can be safely disposed of.
531500	533500	And there we have it.
533500	536500	A nice silver coating on the inside of our vial.
536500	540500	Since it's opaque, it's got to be at least 100 nanometers or so thick,
540500	544500	but I have no real way to measure its thickness accurately.
544500	550500	Now, silver is a fantastic electrical conductor, but this silver layer isn't solid.
550500	553500	It's actually tons and tons of tiny particles all stuck together.
553500	558500	It should be electrically conductive though, so let's measure that.
558500	564500	Good news, I'm reading a resistance of less than one ohm on this piece of glass, so it's definitely conductive.
564500	568500	Alright, now let's see if we can get a good layer on this silicon chip.
568500	572500	I grew an oxide on it and made sure it was nice and clean.
572500	576500	I prepared the silver solution and added it to the vial along with the chip.
576500	580500	I shook the vial to distribute the solution in an attempt to evenly coat the chip,
580500	585500	and, once again, waited about three minutes for the silver mirror to form.
585500	590500	Once that was done, I extracted the chip and washed it with distilled water and dried it.
590500	594500	Wow, I clearly damaged the chip from all that shaking.
594500	598500	It's missing chunks out of the corners, but at least it's coated relatively evenly,
598500	601500	and the layer is indeed conductive.
601500	606500	The only problem is that the coating is not adhering super well.
606500	611500	It's pretty easy to rub the silver layer off with something like a paper towel.
611500	614500	Maybe we can make it stronger by annealing it in the tube furnace.
614500	619500	I put the chip in my quartz boat and slid it into the furnace a few times at various temperatures,
619500	624500	from 500 Celsius to 1000 Celsius to see if it had any effect.
624500	630500	It's hard to tell, but I think the higher temperatures did improve the durability slightly,
630500	635500	but when I went back and tested the resistance, the silver layer was no longer conductive.
635500	642500	I found this odd because silver is a noble metal and doesn't really react with oxygen or nitrogen in the air,
642500	643500	even at high temperatures.
643500	648500	Unlike metals such as iron or aluminum, which readily react with air to form oxides,
648500	653500	silver compounds actually decompose at high temperatures back into silver metal.
653500	657500	So it's not really likely that this layer is anything but pure silver,
657500	660500	so why is it no longer conductive?
660500	663500	I scratched my head for a while trying to figure this one out,
663500	667500	and eventually found this research paper that gave me the answer.
667500	673500	Thin silver layers, when heated, beat up and separate into a bunch of tiny silver dots.
673500	677500	They are still elemental silver, but since they are no longer connected to each other,
677500	679500	they cannot conduct electricity.
679500	684500	This effect happens even if the silver is heated to temperatures well below its melting point,
684500	690500	which means that we cannot use the furnace to anneal the layer without risking the layer becoming non-conductive.
690500	695500	This is a bit of a disappointment, but as long as we're careful not to scratch the silver layer,
695500	698500	it should still be durable enough for our purposes.
698500	703500	Now that I was sure I could use this chemical method to create a usable silver layer,
703500	708500	I charged ahead and attempted to combine it with photolithography in the liftoff process described earlier.
708500	713500	This is the one where you apply the photoresist first, and then the silver layer on top of that.
714500	717500	I applied the photoresist to the chip using the laminator,
717500	722500	and then exposed and developed it using the same mask from the previous video.
722500	727500	Once I verified the chip was clean, I went ahead and prepared the silver solution as before.
727500	734500	This time, though, I used twice as much, just to make it a little easier to swirl and ensure it actually gets all over the chip.
734500	740500	I mixed the silver nitrate, sodium hydroxide, and ammonia solutions first, then put the chip in,
740500	743500	then added the glucose to start the reaction.
743500	749500	It was right about here that I started realizing that something went terribly, terribly wrong.
749500	757500	Three minutes later, I once again got a beautiful silver mirror and extracted the chip when I realized I had made a serious mistake.
757500	760500	The photoresist was completely gone.
760500	761500	What happened?
761500	763500	Here's the problem.
763500	769500	The developer solution is sodium carbonate, and if we measure the pH at somewhere between 10 and 11,
769500	774500	I measured the pH of the silver mirror solution and found that it had a pH of at least 12,
774500	779500	which is no surprise considering that sodium hydroxide and ammonia are strongly alkaline.
779500	784500	We know from the previous video that basic solutions will damage the photoresist over time,
784500	790500	and it looks like the pH of the silver solution is high enough to cause the photoresist layer to disintegrate completely.
790500	795500	I had a moment of panic because I thought this meant that the whole project was dead in the water.
795500	800500	Then I realized that the situation wasn't quite as dire as I had feared.
800500	804500	Yes, the silver plating solution is incompatible with the photoresist,
804500	809500	but that just means that we can't apply the silver after we apply the photoresist.
809500	811500	We can still apply the silver before.
811500	816500	This means that we can't use liftoff, but we can use the etching method.
816500	821500	In order to make this method work, we'll need to develop and test an etching solution for silver.
821500	824500	Fortunately, I have just the thing.
824500	827500	These are the vials left over from all the previous reactions.
827500	831500	I can use them to test any etching solutions we come up with.
831500	835500	Speaking of etching, we sort of backed ourselves into a bit of a corner.
835500	842500	You see, the fact that silver is a noble metal means that silver much prefers to be an element instead of a compound.
842500	846500	This is why our silver mirror reaction is so easy.
846500	852500	It takes very little persuasion to convert the dissolved silver ions back into elemental silver metal.
852500	859500	However, this means that the reverse, converting the silver metal into silver ions, is hard.
859500	863500	Even strong acids like sulfuric and hydrochloric acid alone won't do the job.
863500	869500	The usual method for dissolving silver is to use nitric acid, but I don't have any of that.
869500	873500	Fortunately, there is a cheat code when it comes to acids.
873500	879500	You can add a small amount of peroxide to an acid to allow it to react with metals that it normally wouldn't be able to.
879500	886500	I added about 10 milliliters of concentrated sulfuric acid to about 10 milliliters of 12% hydrogen peroxide,
886500	890500	making a slightly diluted version of something called piranha etch.
890500	896500	This stuff will react aggressively with organic material, so it's important to keep yourself safe and protected.
896500	901500	I poured the piranha solution into the silver vial and waited.
902500	909500	It does indeed strip the silver off, but it's not exactly what I'd call a nice or even process.
909500	914500	It seems like the silver is sort of flaking off in an uncontrolled manner.
914500	921500	I tried the same thing with hydrochloric acid and peroxide, hoping for better results, but the outcome was exactly the same.
921500	924500	Just this slow flaking of the silver layer.
924500	927500	It took a bit of thinking, but I realized the problem.
927500	932500	In order for the silver etching process to work, you need two different things.
932500	940500	First, you need the etchant to react with the silver, and second, you need the product of the reaction to be soluble.
940500	949500	You see, when we reacted the silver layer with sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid, the silver converted to silver sulfate and silver chloride respectively.
949500	956500	Both of these compounds are insoluble in water, so the surface silver atoms reacted, but they didn't go into solution.
956500	961500	Instead, they just stayed there, blocking the remaining silver atoms from reacting.
961500	970500	If instead we chose an acid that produced a soluble silver compound, the silver would react and then dissolve, going into solution and exposing the remaining silver,
970500	976500	allowing the subsequent layers to react, eventually removing all of the silver in a reliable fashion.
976500	980500	This is why nitric acid is the preferred etchant for silver.
980500	983500	Here's a list of silver compounds sorted by solubility.
984500	991500	You can see here that silver nitrate has an insane solubility of almost 3 kilograms per liter of water.
991500	998500	The next on the list is silver fluoride, so it's possible that we could use HF to edge the silver.
998500	1003500	However, we really shouldn't be using HF for anything we don't absolutely have to.
1003500	1011500	Well, the next compound on the list is silver acetate, which is just about two orders of magnitude less soluble,
1011500	1014500	about 11 grams per liter of water.
1014500	1022500	Still, this might just be enough, and better yet, silver acetate is formed by acetic acid and peroxide,
1022500	1027500	which is a much, much less scary combo than hydrofluoric acid and peroxide.
1027500	1031500	I stole some vinegar from the kitchen, which is about 5% acetic acid,
1031500	1038500	and I mixed it with an equal amount of 12% peroxide and poured it into one of the silver vials and waited.
1038500	1041500	Hey, that's more like it.
1041500	1049500	The etching process is much quicker and a lot more consistent than with either the sulfuric or hydrochloric acid.
1049500	1056500	Just goes to show that sometimes the best solution is not the strongest chemical, but the right chemical.
1056500	1063500	I used my hot plate to warm the vinegar peroxide solution to about 50 Celsius and the results were even better.
1063500	1066500	The silver layer was stripped bare in only a few seconds.
1066500	1069500	Looks like we've found a suitable etchant for silver.
1069500	1074500	Now that we have our etchant, let's try the photolithography again using the etching process.
1074500	1078500	I once again prepared the silver mirror solution and added my silicon chip.
1078500	1086500	This time, to avoid damaging the chip, I'm using a narrow vial and rocking it back and forth rather than shaking it to pieces like last time.
1086500	1094500	This method has the added benefit of allowing you to see what's going on as the layer deposits, assuming you're careful and don't rotate the vial.
1094500	1101500	I rinsed and dried the chip and once again peeled the protective plastic layer off the photoresist and ran it through the laminator.
1101500	1109500	I made a new mask that is just three traces or wires of varying width to more quantitatively test the resistance of the silver layer.
1109500	1111500	Looks like the exposure was successful.
1111500	1116500	Now I just need to remove the final protective plastic layer from the photoresist and develop it.
1116500	1119500	Wait a minute, what just happened?
1119500	1121500	Well, there's the problem.
1121500	1125500	Instead of peeling the protective plastic layer off the photoresist,
1125500	1130500	everything, the plastic, photoresist, and silver layer, peeled completely off the chip.
1130500	1135500	It looks like the silver layer is not very well adhered to the silicon dioxide surface of the chip.
1135500	1140500	I thought this might just be a cleanliness problem, so I tried again several more times.
1140500	1145500	I tried baking the chip to remove any traces of moisture adsorbed to the surface,
1145500	1153500	as well as using piranha solution to destroy any trace of organic material like oils that might have been a problem, but nothing worked.
1153500	1156500	Each attempt produced the exact same results.
1156500	1161500	Now, I'm sure that some of you are yelling at your screen telling me I have to use a plasma cleaner,
1161500	1166500	and that probably would help, but sadly I don't have one.
1166500	1170500	Also, even a pristine surface wouldn't really improve things very much.
1170500	1176500	The reason for this is that silver just doesn't adhere well to silicon dioxide. Period.
1176500	1183500	This is one of the reasons that silver isn't very commonly used to make integrated circuits, even though it's the most conductive metal.
1183500	1186500	When the need arises and silver absolutely has to be used,
1186500	1192500	it's often deposited on top of a thin layer of something else that has better adhesion to glass.
1192500	1195500	Really, the main problem here is the photoresist itself.
1195500	1200500	The photoresist I'm using is a very thin layer in between two pieces of protective plastic.
1200500	1208500	Unfortunately, though, this plastic layer is sticking to the photoresist better than the silver is sticking to the chip, causing our silver layer to delaminate.
1208500	1213500	Now, it's tempting to just remove the plastic at the start of the process,
1213500	1218500	but without the protective plastic, the photoresist will surely be destroyed when it runs through the laminator.
1218500	1219500	Curses.
1219500	1225500	If only the manufacturer had considered my ridiculous out-of-spec use case for their product and designed it better.
1225500	1231500	If only the plastic layer were something more slippery, something like... wait a minute.
1232500	1238500	Actually, there's nothing stopping me from replacing the clear plastic layer with a more suitable material.
1238500	1240500	And I know just the thing.
1240500	1245500	PTFE, or Teflon, is extremely slippery because of its carbon fluorine bonds,
1245500	1248500	and it's readily available as thread sealing tape.
1248500	1249500	Let's see if this works.
1249500	1253500	I used tape as normal to remove the first piece of plastic from the photoresist.
1253500	1259500	Then, I stuck another piece of tape directly to the edge of the photoresist and peeled the second layer of plastic off,
1259500	1263500	leaving me with the very thin, fragile resist layer only.
1263500	1268500	I placed that on top of the silver layer on a new chip and carefully applied the Teflon tape,
1268500	1272500	then used a piece of index card to encase the whole thing and ran it through the laminator.
1272500	1279500	Well, it was a little tricky, but I did manage to separate the PTFE from the photoresist without peeling the silver layer off.
1279500	1283500	I found that it helps to turn the temperature of the laminator down slightly.
1283500	1288500	Don't turn the temperature too far down, though, or you'll get bubbles like I did in this other chip.
1288500	1289500	This one should be fine, though.
1289500	1293500	I once again exposed the photoresist and developed it as normal.
1293500	1296500	Now, it's finally time to use the silver etching solution.
1297500	1299500	Man, that is so satisfying.
1300500	1301500	The results are excellent.
1302500	1307500	Now that the silver layer is gone, we just need to remove the remaining photoresist with acetone.
1307500	1314500	This is the last step, and I'm basically holding my breath at this point, hoping I don't run into any more problems.
1314500	1319500	Fortunately, the photoresist layer separated and the silver remained undamaged.
1320500	1323500	I checked the resistance of each of the traces with a multimeter.
1323500	1330500	It looks like the narrow trace is about 20 ohms, the medium trace is about 10 ohms, and the fat trace is 5 ohms,
1330500	1332500	which I think is acceptable for now.
1332500	1338500	I might be able to tweak the process and get a thicker silver layer for better conductivity, but I'm not going to bother right now.
1338500	1342500	What is bothering me is the durability of the silver layer.
1342500	1348500	The probes aren't really sharp, but they are more than enough to scrape away material from the landing pads I made.
1348500	1352500	You know what? I think I have just the thing to fix this.
1352500	1354500	Remember the conductive paint from earlier?
1355500	1360500	Well, it may not work with photoresist, but I can still paint it on manually to protect the pads a little.
1360500	1364500	That was a little sloppy, but nothing an exacto knife can't fix.
1364500	1366500	Let's see if that makes an improvement.
1366500	1371500	Well, it's not perfect, but it's clearly protecting the silver layer a little bit.
1371500	1377500	In the future, I'll have to do more tests and see if something like conductive epoxy would be a better choice for this.
1377500	1379500	For now, though, I'm pretty satisfied.
1379500	1383500	The last thing I want to do is test the resolution of the process.
1383500	1391500	I used the mask from the last video and ran through the same process of depositing the silver, doing the photolithography, and etching the silver away.
1391500	1396500	The results look great. I don't really see any major issues with undercutting.
1396500	1402500	I expect that the resolution of the metal layer is limited by the photolithography, which is what we want.
1402500	1409500	Well, I think I've set a record for the number of nearly insurmountable problems that I had to overcome to make this process work.
1409500	1411500	But work it does.
1411500	1415500	I made a bunch of copies of the chip, and the results were all pretty consistent.
1415500	1420500	I'm sure there is work to be done in the future to improve the process, but I'm going to call this here.
1420500	1427500	I'm very pleased that I was able to make metallization work using a simple chemical process that requires no fancy equipment whatsoever.
1427500	1435500	I think in the future, I'll still want to make a thermal evaporator for increased flexibility, but for now, this silvering process should suffice.
1435500	1438500	I just want to thank everyone for making it to the end of this video.
1438500	1443500	I also want to thank everyone who emailed me after my last video with photoresist information.
1443500	1448500	I'm making some good progress on that front, and I'm super excited to share it soon.
1448500	1453500	I also want to thank my patrons who funded this project and bought all of these random chemicals.
1453500	1456500	Thank you so much. I'll see you next time.
