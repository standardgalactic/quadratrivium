1. **Objective**: To create a homemade metallization process for a DIY PCB without specialized equipment.
   
2. **Materials Used**:
   - Silver nitrate solution (for depositing silver on the substrate)
   - Photoresist (to protect certain areas from being etched)
   - PTFE/Teflon tape (as an alternative to the clear plastic layer for separating photoresist and substrate)
   - Acetone (for developing the photoresist)
   - Copper clad board (as the base substrate)

3. **Process**:
   - Deposit a thin layer of silver on the copper clad board using the silver nitrate solution.
   - Apply and expose photoresist to light through a mask, hardening it where it's exposed.
   - Develop the photoresist, which reveals the silver in the unexposed areas.
   - Etch away the unwanted silver with an appropriate etching solution (in this case, ferric chloride).
   - Remove the remaining photoresist with acetone.

4. **Challenges and Solutions**:
   - The clear plastic layer used in previous methods was prone to tearing during development. To solve this, the experimenter replaced it with PTFE/Teflon tape, which proved to be more durable and easier to handle.
   - The silver layer was susceptible to damage from probes, so a conductive paint was applied manually to protect the landing pads.

5. **Results**:
   - Successfully created a patterned metallization layer on a PCB with high resolution and consistency.
   - Demonstrated that it's possible to create a functional DIY PCB without expensive equipment by using chemical processes and common materials.

6. **Future Improvements**:
   - The experimenter plans to explore the use of conductive epoxy for better protection of the silver layer.
   - A thermal evaporator might be built in the future for more flexibility and control over the process.

7. **Acknowledgements**:
   - The experimenter thanks viewers, patrons, and those who provided photoresist advice for their support and assistance.

8. **Conclusion**:
   - The experiment was a success in creating a metallization layer on a DIY PCB using only basic chemicals and materials, proving that complex processes can be replicated at home with creativity and resourcefulness.
