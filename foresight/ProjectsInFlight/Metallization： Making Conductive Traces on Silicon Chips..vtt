00:00.000 --> 00:05.500
In my previous video, I used commonly available materials to do photolithography on silicon.

00:05.500 --> 00:10.800
Today, I'm going to combine photolithography and one of my all-time favorite chemical reactions

00:10.800 --> 00:15.500
to create the conductive metal wires used to connect devices in an integrated circuit.

00:17.800 --> 00:21.500
I've already talked at length about the development of the integrated circuit

00:21.500 --> 00:25.000
and how humanity went from being able to produce a single transistor

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
to billions of transistors on the same chip.

00:28.000 --> 00:32.500
However, billions of unconnected transistors on their own won't do anything

00:32.500 --> 00:35.000
unless we can wire them together in a circuit.

00:35.000 --> 00:40.500
A cheap, reliable, and scalable method for producing metal wires on the surface of a silicon chip

00:40.500 --> 00:44.000
is therefore a top priority in integrated circuit fabrication.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.500
To accomplish this task, we want to deposit a layer of solid conductive metal

00:48.500 --> 00:51.500
such as aluminum, copper, silver, or gold,

00:51.500 --> 00:55.000
and then use photolithography to remove the metal that we don't want,

00:55.000 --> 00:59.500
leaving behind a bunch of thin wires that connect individual devices together in a circuit.

00:59.500 --> 01:02.500
There are two common ways to accomplish this task.

01:02.500 --> 01:04.500
The first is an etching process.

01:04.500 --> 01:10.000
In this process, you deposit a layer of metal onto the chip and then apply photoresist over that.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.500
Then you expose and develop the resist, which removes portions of the photoresist layer.

01:14.500 --> 01:18.500
Then you immerse the chip in an etching solution that dissolves the exposed metal,

01:18.500 --> 01:22.000
leaving behind metal only where the photoresist is still protecting it.

01:22.500 --> 01:25.500
Then you immerse the chip in a solvent that dissolves the photoresist,

01:25.500 --> 01:28.000
which gives you your final product.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
The second method is called lift-off.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.500
In this method, you put the photoresist layer down first.

01:33.500 --> 01:38.000
You again expose and develop the resist, which removes portions of the photoresist layer.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.500
Then you deposit metal on top of that.

01:40.500 --> 01:43.000
Notice that the metal layer sticks to the whole surface,

01:43.000 --> 01:47.500
regardless of whether the surface is the chip itself or the photoresist layer above.

01:47.500 --> 01:51.000
Then you immerse the chip in a solvent that dissolves the resist.

01:51.000 --> 01:56.500
As the resist dissolves, any metal on top lifts off the chip and is carried away.

01:56.500 --> 02:01.000
The metal that was in direct contact with the chip is unaffected by the solvent and sticks around,

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
giving you your final product.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.500
Now, regardless of which method we choose,

02:05.500 --> 02:11.500
we still need some way of depositing an even layer of metal on the surface of a silicon wafer.

02:11.500 --> 02:13.500
In modern semiconductor fabs,

02:13.500 --> 02:18.500
metal layers are deposited onto the surface of the chip in a process called thermal evaporation.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.500
This process is carried out in a vacuum chamber,

02:21.500 --> 02:25.000
and a small sample of metal is heated until it vaporizes.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
Just as boiling water produces steam,

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
vaporizing metal produces a cloud of metal particles,

02:30.000 --> 02:35.000
which condenses or deposits onto the surface of a chip in a smooth uniform layer.

02:35.000 --> 02:40.000
This process is nice because it's reliable, controllable, and clean.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
The downside of this process for the hobbyist

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
is that it requires the construction of a dedicated machine

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
with expensive parts in order to make it work.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
It would be nice if a method were available

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
to produce conductive layers on a chip without the need

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
to spend a bunch of time and money building a thermal evaporator.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
I sat down and thought about the problem for a while,

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
and realized there might be an easier way.

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
Whatever method we use needs to meet the following requirements.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
First, the layer needs to be conductive.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
Traces ideally should be less than 10 ohms or so.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.500
Second, the layer needs to be durable.

03:13.500 --> 03:16.500
Traces shouldn't fall off or deteriorate over time.

03:17.500 --> 03:20.500
Third, the process needs to be reliable.

03:20.500 --> 03:23.500
We don't want to have to try over and over again to get good results.

03:23.500 --> 03:26.500
Fourth, the process needs to be quick.

03:26.500 --> 03:28.500
We don't want the step to take too long,

03:28.500 --> 03:31.500
or it will dramatically slow down the whole fabrication process.

03:31.500 --> 03:35.500
Fifth, the process needs to be compatible with photolithography.

03:35.500 --> 03:39.500
Otherwise, we won't be able to create accurate connections to devices on the chip.

03:39.500 --> 03:43.500
And last, the process needs to be as cheap and easy as possible.

03:43.500 --> 03:47.500
Otherwise, it's better to just spend the time building the thermal evaporator.

03:47.500 --> 03:49.500
My first idea was to use conductive paint.

03:49.500 --> 03:53.500
I think most hobbyists who have played with circuits have probably seen stuff like this.

03:53.500 --> 03:58.500
Little pens that dispense ink that contains enough graphite or silver particles to conduct electricity,

03:58.500 --> 04:01.500
allowing you to literally draw circuits on paper.

04:01.500 --> 04:06.500
Most conductive paint is designed to be applied to paper and not glass, silicon dioxide.

04:06.500 --> 04:09.500
However, I did find this product from Permatex.

04:09.500 --> 04:12.500
It's a conductive paint used to repair vehicle defoggers.

04:12.500 --> 04:17.500
If you've never noticed them, they are those little metal wires you see on your rear window.

04:17.500 --> 04:21.500
Electric current is passed through them and it causes those wires to heat up,

04:21.500 --> 04:23.500
which heats the glass and defogs your window.

04:23.500 --> 04:28.500
What's nice about this product is that it's specifically formulated to stick to glass.

04:28.500 --> 04:32.500
It's a bit expensive, about $20 for this tiny bottle.

04:32.500 --> 04:38.500
I tested it on a microscope slide and used tape to make a small line about 5 centimeters long

04:38.500 --> 04:40.500
and a couple of millimeters wide.

04:40.500 --> 04:44.500
I tested its conductivity with a meter and I was pleased by the results.

04:44.500 --> 04:48.500
However, I realized a major problem.

04:48.500 --> 04:52.500
This paint is not compatible with our photolithography process.

04:52.500 --> 04:57.500
I exposed the paint to acetone, which is used to strip photoresist, and it came right off.

04:57.500 --> 05:01.500
I also tested it by exposing it to developer solution,

05:01.500 --> 05:08.500
and while it was a little bit more resilient, it still weakened the paint to such a degree that it rubbed off quite easily.

05:08.500 --> 05:12.500
I could have tested other paints, but I'm fairly confident that other types of conductive paint

05:12.500 --> 05:16.500
will suffer the same problems with solvent resistance that we saw here.

05:16.500 --> 05:20.500
This means that this method is probably not suitable for making chips.

05:20.500 --> 05:23.500
I also briefly considered conductive epoxy.

05:23.500 --> 05:30.500
Unfortunately, all of the conductive epoxy I found required long cure times, hours or days instead of minutes.

05:30.500 --> 05:36.500
It also can't be easily etched away, and I suspect it will probably not work too well with liftoff either.

05:36.500 --> 05:40.500
So it's probably not very compatible with our photolithography process.

05:40.500 --> 05:42.500
Moving on.

05:42.500 --> 05:44.500
A chemical process was my next idea.

05:44.500 --> 05:48.500
One of the most common chemistry demos in high school is the silver mirror reaction,

05:48.500 --> 05:50.500
which produces a thin layer of silver on glass.

05:50.500 --> 05:53.500
The silver mirror reaction requires the following chemicals.

05:53.500 --> 05:57.500
Sodium hydroxide and ammonia are readily available from hardware stores,

05:57.500 --> 06:01.500
and silver nitrate and glucose are easy enough to find online.

06:01.500 --> 06:06.500
Rather than working out the math myself, I'm going to use the same formulation I found in a chemistry demo kit.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.500
It calls for the following solutions.

06:08.500 --> 06:12.500
First, we prepare a 0.6 molar solution of silver nitrate.

06:12.500 --> 06:17.500
That corresponds to 1 gram of silver nitrate and 10 milliliters of distilled water.

06:17.500 --> 06:21.500
The solution is light sensitive, so I'm storing it in an amber vial.

06:21.500 --> 06:23.500
Do your best to keep it out of direct sunlight.

06:23.500 --> 06:27.500
Next, we need a 2.5 molar solution of sodium hydroxide.

06:27.500 --> 06:32.500
That is, coincidentally, 1 gram of sodium hydroxide and 10 milliliters of water.

06:32.500 --> 06:36.500
Make sure to add the sodium hydroxide to water and not the other way around.

06:36.500 --> 06:41.500
Sodium hydroxide can heat up a lot when it dissolves, so go slow and be careful.

06:41.500 --> 06:44.500
Now we need a 2 molar ammonia solution.

06:44.500 --> 06:50.500
This ammonia is 10%, which is about 6 molar, so I used 1 part ammonia and 2 parts water for my solution.

06:50.500 --> 06:52.500
Lastly, we need glucose.

06:52.500 --> 06:55.500
Note that you cannot use regular table sugar for this reaction.

06:55.500 --> 06:58.500
It has to be glucose specifically.

06:58.500 --> 07:04.500
We need a 10% glucose solution, which is 1 gram of glucose plus 10 milliliters of water.

07:04.500 --> 07:06.500
Shake until dissolved.

07:06.500 --> 07:13.500
I've labeled each vial and also labeled a pipette corresponding to each chemical, so I don't accidentally contaminate them.

07:13.500 --> 07:15.500
Alright, I think I'm ready to see if this works.

07:15.500 --> 07:17.500
The procedure is simple.

07:17.500 --> 07:24.500
We start with 5 drops of the silver nitrate solution, then we add 3 drops of the sodium hydroxide solution.

07:24.500 --> 07:31.500
This causes the silver nitrate to react and form silver oxide, which forms this dark brown precipitate.

07:31.500 --> 07:37.500
Next, we add 15 drops of the ammonia solution and swirl or shake the vial.

07:37.500 --> 07:41.500
This forms an ammonia complex that dissolves back into the solution.

07:41.500 --> 07:45.500
Last, we add 2 drops of the glucose solution.

07:45.500 --> 07:49.500
This is actually my first time seeing this reaction happen in person.

07:49.500 --> 07:57.500
The solution started out clear, but quickly developed a slight dark tint as small amounts of silver precipitated out of solution.

07:57.500 --> 08:05.500
I slowly twisted the vial in my hands in order to distribute the small amount of solution as evenly as possible on the walls of the vial.

08:05.500 --> 08:11.500
After about a minute, it became obvious that some kind of coating was developing on the inner wall of the vial,

08:11.500 --> 08:16.500
and after about 3 minutes, that coating became a brilliant silver mirror.

08:16.500 --> 08:19.500
I was honestly impressed it was this easy.

08:19.500 --> 08:23.500
I ran the test several more times and never had any issues with the reliability.

08:23.500 --> 08:25.500
It just works.

08:25.500 --> 08:31.500
Once I was satisfied that the solution was used up, I needed to deal with the liquid remaining in the vial.

08:31.500 --> 08:35.500
Apparently, you should make sure not to let the solution dry out,

08:35.500 --> 08:39.500
as it is possible for it to form silver fulminate, an explosive compound.

08:39.500 --> 08:44.500
Now, I seriously doubt the amount I have is any danger,

08:44.500 --> 08:48.500
but just to be safe, I'm going to pour it into a solution of sodium chloride.

08:48.500 --> 08:51.500
Once that's done, it can be safely disposed of.

08:51.500 --> 08:53.500
And there we have it.

08:53.500 --> 08:56.500
A nice silver coating on the inside of our vial.

08:56.500 --> 09:00.500
Since it's opaque, it's got to be at least 100 nanometers or so thick,

09:00.500 --> 09:04.500
but I have no real way to measure its thickness accurately.

09:04.500 --> 09:10.500
Now, silver is a fantastic electrical conductor, but this silver layer isn't solid.

09:10.500 --> 09:13.500
It's actually tons and tons of tiny particles all stuck together.

09:13.500 --> 09:18.500
It should be electrically conductive though, so let's measure that.

09:18.500 --> 09:24.500
Good news, I'm reading a resistance of less than one ohm on this piece of glass, so it's definitely conductive.

09:24.500 --> 09:28.500
Alright, now let's see if we can get a good layer on this silicon chip.

09:28.500 --> 09:32.500
I grew an oxide on it and made sure it was nice and clean.

09:32.500 --> 09:36.500
I prepared the silver solution and added it to the vial along with the chip.

09:36.500 --> 09:40.500
I shook the vial to distribute the solution in an attempt to evenly coat the chip,

09:40.500 --> 09:45.500
and, once again, waited about three minutes for the silver mirror to form.

09:45.500 --> 09:50.500
Once that was done, I extracted the chip and washed it with distilled water and dried it.

09:50.500 --> 09:54.500
Wow, I clearly damaged the chip from all that shaking.

09:54.500 --> 09:58.500
It's missing chunks out of the corners, but at least it's coated relatively evenly,

09:58.500 --> 10:01.500
and the layer is indeed conductive.

10:01.500 --> 10:06.500
The only problem is that the coating is not adhering super well.

10:06.500 --> 10:11.500
It's pretty easy to rub the silver layer off with something like a paper towel.

10:11.500 --> 10:14.500
Maybe we can make it stronger by annealing it in the tube furnace.

10:14.500 --> 10:19.500
I put the chip in my quartz boat and slid it into the furnace a few times at various temperatures,

10:19.500 --> 10:24.500
from 500 Celsius to 1000 Celsius to see if it had any effect.

10:24.500 --> 10:30.500
It's hard to tell, but I think the higher temperatures did improve the durability slightly,

10:30.500 --> 10:35.500
but when I went back and tested the resistance, the silver layer was no longer conductive.

10:35.500 --> 10:42.500
I found this odd because silver is a noble metal and doesn't really react with oxygen or nitrogen in the air,

10:42.500 --> 10:43.500
even at high temperatures.

10:43.500 --> 10:48.500
Unlike metals such as iron or aluminum, which readily react with air to form oxides,

10:48.500 --> 10:53.500
silver compounds actually decompose at high temperatures back into silver metal.

10:53.500 --> 10:57.500
So it's not really likely that this layer is anything but pure silver,

10:57.500 --> 11:00.500
so why is it no longer conductive?

11:00.500 --> 11:03.500
I scratched my head for a while trying to figure this one out,

11:03.500 --> 11:07.500
and eventually found this research paper that gave me the answer.

11:07.500 --> 11:13.500
Thin silver layers, when heated, beat up and separate into a bunch of tiny silver dots.

11:13.500 --> 11:17.500
They are still elemental silver, but since they are no longer connected to each other,

11:17.500 --> 11:19.500
they cannot conduct electricity.

11:19.500 --> 11:24.500
This effect happens even if the silver is heated to temperatures well below its melting point,

11:24.500 --> 11:30.500
which means that we cannot use the furnace to anneal the layer without risking the layer becoming non-conductive.

11:30.500 --> 11:35.500
This is a bit of a disappointment, but as long as we're careful not to scratch the silver layer,

11:35.500 --> 11:38.500
it should still be durable enough for our purposes.

11:38.500 --> 11:43.500
Now that I was sure I could use this chemical method to create a usable silver layer,

11:43.500 --> 11:48.500
I charged ahead and attempted to combine it with photolithography in the liftoff process described earlier.

11:48.500 --> 11:53.500
This is the one where you apply the photoresist first, and then the silver layer on top of that.

11:54.500 --> 11:57.500
I applied the photoresist to the chip using the laminator,

11:57.500 --> 12:02.500
and then exposed and developed it using the same mask from the previous video.

12:02.500 --> 12:07.500
Once I verified the chip was clean, I went ahead and prepared the silver solution as before.

12:07.500 --> 12:14.500
This time, though, I used twice as much, just to make it a little easier to swirl and ensure it actually gets all over the chip.

12:14.500 --> 12:20.500
I mixed the silver nitrate, sodium hydroxide, and ammonia solutions first, then put the chip in,

12:20.500 --> 12:23.500
then added the glucose to start the reaction.

12:23.500 --> 12:29.500
It was right about here that I started realizing that something went terribly, terribly wrong.

12:29.500 --> 12:37.500
Three minutes later, I once again got a beautiful silver mirror and extracted the chip when I realized I had made a serious mistake.

12:37.500 --> 12:40.500
The photoresist was completely gone.

12:40.500 --> 12:41.500
What happened?

12:41.500 --> 12:43.500
Here's the problem.

12:43.500 --> 12:49.500
The developer solution is sodium carbonate, and if we measure the pH at somewhere between 10 and 11,

12:49.500 --> 12:54.500
I measured the pH of the silver mirror solution and found that it had a pH of at least 12,

12:54.500 --> 12:59.500
which is no surprise considering that sodium hydroxide and ammonia are strongly alkaline.

12:59.500 --> 13:04.500
We know from the previous video that basic solutions will damage the photoresist over time,

13:04.500 --> 13:10.500
and it looks like the pH of the silver solution is high enough to cause the photoresist layer to disintegrate completely.

13:10.500 --> 13:15.500
I had a moment of panic because I thought this meant that the whole project was dead in the water.

13:15.500 --> 13:20.500
Then I realized that the situation wasn't quite as dire as I had feared.

13:20.500 --> 13:24.500
Yes, the silver plating solution is incompatible with the photoresist,

13:24.500 --> 13:29.500
but that just means that we can't apply the silver after we apply the photoresist.

13:29.500 --> 13:31.500
We can still apply the silver before.

13:31.500 --> 13:36.500
This means that we can't use liftoff, but we can use the etching method.

13:36.500 --> 13:41.500
In order to make this method work, we'll need to develop and test an etching solution for silver.

13:41.500 --> 13:44.500
Fortunately, I have just the thing.

13:44.500 --> 13:47.500
These are the vials left over from all the previous reactions.

13:47.500 --> 13:51.500
I can use them to test any etching solutions we come up with.

13:51.500 --> 13:55.500
Speaking of etching, we sort of backed ourselves into a bit of a corner.

13:55.500 --> 14:02.500
You see, the fact that silver is a noble metal means that silver much prefers to be an element instead of a compound.

14:02.500 --> 14:06.500
This is why our silver mirror reaction is so easy.

14:06.500 --> 14:12.500
It takes very little persuasion to convert the dissolved silver ions back into elemental silver metal.

14:12.500 --> 14:19.500
However, this means that the reverse, converting the silver metal into silver ions, is hard.

14:19.500 --> 14:23.500
Even strong acids like sulfuric and hydrochloric acid alone won't do the job.

14:23.500 --> 14:29.500
The usual method for dissolving silver is to use nitric acid, but I don't have any of that.

14:29.500 --> 14:33.500
Fortunately, there is a cheat code when it comes to acids.

14:33.500 --> 14:39.500
You can add a small amount of peroxide to an acid to allow it to react with metals that it normally wouldn't be able to.

14:39.500 --> 14:46.500
I added about 10 milliliters of concentrated sulfuric acid to about 10 milliliters of 12% hydrogen peroxide,

14:46.500 --> 14:50.500
making a slightly diluted version of something called piranha etch.

14:50.500 --> 14:56.500
This stuff will react aggressively with organic material, so it's important to keep yourself safe and protected.

14:56.500 --> 15:01.500
I poured the piranha solution into the silver vial and waited.

15:02.500 --> 15:09.500
It does indeed strip the silver off, but it's not exactly what I'd call a nice or even process.

15:09.500 --> 15:14.500
It seems like the silver is sort of flaking off in an uncontrolled manner.

15:14.500 --> 15:21.500
I tried the same thing with hydrochloric acid and peroxide, hoping for better results, but the outcome was exactly the same.

15:21.500 --> 15:24.500
Just this slow flaking of the silver layer.

15:24.500 --> 15:27.500
It took a bit of thinking, but I realized the problem.

15:27.500 --> 15:32.500
In order for the silver etching process to work, you need two different things.

15:32.500 --> 15:40.500
First, you need the etchant to react with the silver, and second, you need the product of the reaction to be soluble.

15:40.500 --> 15:49.500
You see, when we reacted the silver layer with sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid, the silver converted to silver sulfate and silver chloride respectively.

15:49.500 --> 15:56.500
Both of these compounds are insoluble in water, so the surface silver atoms reacted, but they didn't go into solution.

15:56.500 --> 16:01.500
Instead, they just stayed there, blocking the remaining silver atoms from reacting.

16:01.500 --> 16:10.500
If instead we chose an acid that produced a soluble silver compound, the silver would react and then dissolve, going into solution and exposing the remaining silver,

16:10.500 --> 16:16.500
allowing the subsequent layers to react, eventually removing all of the silver in a reliable fashion.

16:16.500 --> 16:20.500
This is why nitric acid is the preferred etchant for silver.

16:20.500 --> 16:23.500
Here's a list of silver compounds sorted by solubility.

16:24.500 --> 16:31.500
You can see here that silver nitrate has an insane solubility of almost 3 kilograms per liter of water.

16:31.500 --> 16:38.500
The next on the list is silver fluoride, so it's possible that we could use HF to edge the silver.

16:38.500 --> 16:43.500
However, we really shouldn't be using HF for anything we don't absolutely have to.

16:43.500 --> 16:51.500
Well, the next compound on the list is silver acetate, which is just about two orders of magnitude less soluble,

16:51.500 --> 16:54.500
about 11 grams per liter of water.

16:54.500 --> 17:02.500
Still, this might just be enough, and better yet, silver acetate is formed by acetic acid and peroxide,

17:02.500 --> 17:07.500
which is a much, much less scary combo than hydrofluoric acid and peroxide.

17:07.500 --> 17:11.500
I stole some vinegar from the kitchen, which is about 5% acetic acid,

17:11.500 --> 17:18.500
and I mixed it with an equal amount of 12% peroxide and poured it into one of the silver vials and waited.

17:18.500 --> 17:21.500
Hey, that's more like it.

17:21.500 --> 17:29.500
The etching process is much quicker and a lot more consistent than with either the sulfuric or hydrochloric acid.

17:29.500 --> 17:36.500
Just goes to show that sometimes the best solution is not the strongest chemical, but the right chemical.

17:36.500 --> 17:43.500
I used my hot plate to warm the vinegar peroxide solution to about 50 Celsius and the results were even better.

17:43.500 --> 17:46.500
The silver layer was stripped bare in only a few seconds.

17:46.500 --> 17:49.500
Looks like we've found a suitable etchant for silver.

17:49.500 --> 17:54.500
Now that we have our etchant, let's try the photolithography again using the etching process.

17:54.500 --> 17:58.500
I once again prepared the silver mirror solution and added my silicon chip.

17:58.500 --> 18:06.500
This time, to avoid damaging the chip, I'm using a narrow vial and rocking it back and forth rather than shaking it to pieces like last time.

18:06.500 --> 18:14.500
This method has the added benefit of allowing you to see what's going on as the layer deposits, assuming you're careful and don't rotate the vial.

18:14.500 --> 18:21.500
I rinsed and dried the chip and once again peeled the protective plastic layer off the photoresist and ran it through the laminator.

18:21.500 --> 18:29.500
I made a new mask that is just three traces or wires of varying width to more quantitatively test the resistance of the silver layer.

18:29.500 --> 18:31.500
Looks like the exposure was successful.

18:31.500 --> 18:36.500
Now I just need to remove the final protective plastic layer from the photoresist and develop it.

18:36.500 --> 18:39.500
Wait a minute, what just happened?

18:39.500 --> 18:41.500
Well, there's the problem.

18:41.500 --> 18:45.500
Instead of peeling the protective plastic layer off the photoresist,

18:45.500 --> 18:50.500
everything, the plastic, photoresist, and silver layer, peeled completely off the chip.

18:50.500 --> 18:55.500
It looks like the silver layer is not very well adhered to the silicon dioxide surface of the chip.

18:55.500 --> 19:00.500
I thought this might just be a cleanliness problem, so I tried again several more times.

19:00.500 --> 19:05.500
I tried baking the chip to remove any traces of moisture adsorbed to the surface,

19:05.500 --> 19:13.500
as well as using piranha solution to destroy any trace of organic material like oils that might have been a problem, but nothing worked.

19:13.500 --> 19:16.500
Each attempt produced the exact same results.

19:16.500 --> 19:21.500
Now, I'm sure that some of you are yelling at your screen telling me I have to use a plasma cleaner,

19:21.500 --> 19:26.500
and that probably would help, but sadly I don't have one.

19:26.500 --> 19:30.500
Also, even a pristine surface wouldn't really improve things very much.

19:30.500 --> 19:36.500
The reason for this is that silver just doesn't adhere well to silicon dioxide. Period.

19:36.500 --> 19:43.500
This is one of the reasons that silver isn't very commonly used to make integrated circuits, even though it's the most conductive metal.

19:43.500 --> 19:46.500
When the need arises and silver absolutely has to be used,

19:46.500 --> 19:52.500
it's often deposited on top of a thin layer of something else that has better adhesion to glass.

19:52.500 --> 19:55.500
Really, the main problem here is the photoresist itself.

19:55.500 --> 20:00.500
The photoresist I'm using is a very thin layer in between two pieces of protective plastic.

20:00.500 --> 20:08.500
Unfortunately, though, this plastic layer is sticking to the photoresist better than the silver is sticking to the chip, causing our silver layer to delaminate.

20:08.500 --> 20:13.500
Now, it's tempting to just remove the plastic at the start of the process,

20:13.500 --> 20:18.500
but without the protective plastic, the photoresist will surely be destroyed when it runs through the laminator.

20:18.500 --> 20:19.500
Curses.

20:19.500 --> 20:25.500
If only the manufacturer had considered my ridiculous out-of-spec use case for their product and designed it better.

20:25.500 --> 20:31.500
If only the plastic layer were something more slippery, something like... wait a minute.

20:32.500 --> 20:38.500
Actually, there's nothing stopping me from replacing the clear plastic layer with a more suitable material.

20:38.500 --> 20:40.500
And I know just the thing.

20:40.500 --> 20:45.500
PTFE, or Teflon, is extremely slippery because of its carbon fluorine bonds,

20:45.500 --> 20:48.500
and it's readily available as thread sealing tape.

20:48.500 --> 20:49.500
Let's see if this works.

20:49.500 --> 20:53.500
I used tape as normal to remove the first piece of plastic from the photoresist.

20:53.500 --> 20:59.500
Then, I stuck another piece of tape directly to the edge of the photoresist and peeled the second layer of plastic off,

20:59.500 --> 21:03.500
leaving me with the very thin, fragile resist layer only.

21:03.500 --> 21:08.500
I placed that on top of the silver layer on a new chip and carefully applied the Teflon tape,

21:08.500 --> 21:12.500
then used a piece of index card to encase the whole thing and ran it through the laminator.

21:12.500 --> 21:19.500
Well, it was a little tricky, but I did manage to separate the PTFE from the photoresist without peeling the silver layer off.

21:19.500 --> 21:23.500
I found that it helps to turn the temperature of the laminator down slightly.

21:23.500 --> 21:28.500
Don't turn the temperature too far down, though, or you'll get bubbles like I did in this other chip.

21:28.500 --> 21:29.500
This one should be fine, though.

21:29.500 --> 21:33.500
I once again exposed the photoresist and developed it as normal.

21:33.500 --> 21:36.500
Now, it's finally time to use the silver etching solution.

21:37.500 --> 21:39.500
Man, that is so satisfying.

21:40.500 --> 21:41.500
The results are excellent.

21:42.500 --> 21:47.500
Now that the silver layer is gone, we just need to remove the remaining photoresist with acetone.

21:47.500 --> 21:54.500
This is the last step, and I'm basically holding my breath at this point, hoping I don't run into any more problems.

21:54.500 --> 21:59.500
Fortunately, the photoresist layer separated and the silver remained undamaged.

22:00.500 --> 22:03.500
I checked the resistance of each of the traces with a multimeter.

22:03.500 --> 22:10.500
It looks like the narrow trace is about 20 ohms, the medium trace is about 10 ohms, and the fat trace is 5 ohms,

22:10.500 --> 22:12.500
which I think is acceptable for now.

22:12.500 --> 22:18.500
I might be able to tweak the process and get a thicker silver layer for better conductivity, but I'm not going to bother right now.

22:18.500 --> 22:22.500
What is bothering me is the durability of the silver layer.

22:22.500 --> 22:28.500
The probes aren't really sharp, but they are more than enough to scrape away material from the landing pads I made.

22:28.500 --> 22:32.500
You know what? I think I have just the thing to fix this.

22:32.500 --> 22:34.500
Remember the conductive paint from earlier?

22:35.500 --> 22:40.500
Well, it may not work with photoresist, but I can still paint it on manually to protect the pads a little.

22:40.500 --> 22:44.500
That was a little sloppy, but nothing an exacto knife can't fix.

22:44.500 --> 22:46.500
Let's see if that makes an improvement.

22:46.500 --> 22:51.500
Well, it's not perfect, but it's clearly protecting the silver layer a little bit.

22:51.500 --> 22:57.500
In the future, I'll have to do more tests and see if something like conductive epoxy would be a better choice for this.

22:57.500 --> 22:59.500
For now, though, I'm pretty satisfied.

22:59.500 --> 23:03.500
The last thing I want to do is test the resolution of the process.

23:03.500 --> 23:11.500
I used the mask from the last video and ran through the same process of depositing the silver, doing the photolithography, and etching the silver away.

23:11.500 --> 23:16.500
The results look great. I don't really see any major issues with undercutting.

23:16.500 --> 23:22.500
I expect that the resolution of the metal layer is limited by the photolithography, which is what we want.

23:22.500 --> 23:29.500
Well, I think I've set a record for the number of nearly insurmountable problems that I had to overcome to make this process work.

23:29.500 --> 23:31.500
But work it does.

23:31.500 --> 23:35.500
I made a bunch of copies of the chip, and the results were all pretty consistent.

23:35.500 --> 23:40.500
I'm sure there is work to be done in the future to improve the process, but I'm going to call this here.

23:40.500 --> 23:47.500
I'm very pleased that I was able to make metallization work using a simple chemical process that requires no fancy equipment whatsoever.

23:47.500 --> 23:55.500
I think in the future, I'll still want to make a thermal evaporator for increased flexibility, but for now, this silvering process should suffice.

23:55.500 --> 23:58.500
I just want to thank everyone for making it to the end of this video.

23:58.500 --> 24:03.500
I also want to thank everyone who emailed me after my last video with photoresist information.

24:03.500 --> 24:08.500
I'm making some good progress on that front, and I'm super excited to share it soon.

24:08.500 --> 24:13.500
I also want to thank my patrons who funded this project and bought all of these random chemicals.

24:13.500 --> 24:16.500
Thank you so much. I'll see you next time.
