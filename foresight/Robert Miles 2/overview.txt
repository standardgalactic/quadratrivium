1. Fiction can significantly influence people's perception of reality, especially when it comes to predicting or understanding future events or technologies like AI. People often treat fictional narratives as if they hold some truth about the world, even though these stories are purely imaginative and did not actually occur in reality.

2. When discussing real-world issues, such as the potential risks of AI, people tend to reference fictional scenarios from movies like "2001: A Space Odyssey" or "iRobot" as if they were evidence of what could happen. However, these examples are not empirical data and should not be treated as such.

3. There is a cognitive dissonance where people believe both that bad things can happen with AI but also that humanity will always find a way to overcome any problem presented by such technologies. This dual belief comes from the influence of fictional narratives, which often show characters overcoming insurmountable odds.

4. The difficulty in conveying the genuine risks associated with existential threats like AI or asteroid impacts lies in the fact that we have no historical evidence of humanity being wiped out, either in fiction or reality. This makes it challenging to instill a sense of urgency about potential catastrophic events.

5. The human race is currently in an unprecedented situation where we face global risks without any prior experience or guidance on how to navigate them successfully. We have one shot at getting this right, with no second chances if we fail to address the critical challenges before us. It is imperative that we tackle these issues head-on and recognize the importance of preparing for potential worst-case scenarios.
