0	7440	So there's a thing that I see people routinely fail to get and it's a little hard to express.
9120	9920	I'm just going to try.
12320	19760	There's no rule which says that we make it. There's no rule which says that humanity has
19760	24160	to survive this century or even this decade. There's no rule that says that everything's going
24160	29200	to be okay. And when I say this to people they generally accept it. Most of the people I talk
29360	33280	to anyway. They say, yeah of course. Of course there's no rule that says that we have to make it.
33280	37280	Of course humanity could fail. We could go extinct. It could happen.
39920	46320	It's like they know it, but they don't feel it. They don't take it seriously as an actual
46320	51200	possibility. They kind of think, okay we have these things that we have to do. We have these
51200	58720	challenges we have to overcome and so we'll do that. We'll rise to the occasion. We'll figure out
58800	65520	what we need to do and we'll do it. But okay, this is a related concept. There's no rule which
65520	70800	says that the challenges we're faced with are challenges that we are capable of meeting.
72560	76800	Think about something like an asteroid strike. If a big enough asteroid hits earth we're pretty
76800	80240	much done for, right? And I'm not saying that this is something we should day to day be concerned
80240	85760	about because we're dealing with geological periods of time, right? Regularly asteroids hit
85760	93120	earth. We're sort of due for one, but what does that really mean? Sometime in the next
93920	98000	million years or whatever it is. So we have more pressing concerns, but
99680	104480	when people are prepared to take seriously the possibility of an asteroid strike,
105040	109520	usually it's because they're thinking about it like, oh interesting. Okay, so we have good
109520	114720	telescopes. We would spot the thing. I wonder how long we would have. Would that be enough warning?
114720	119280	Would that be enough time for us to build whatever it is that we needed to build to go up there
119280	124320	and redirect it or blow it up or whatever? So they're willing to think about the possibility
125440	132240	from the perspective of tackling the challenge. But the thing is, as I said, the periods of time
132240	138400	that pass between asteroid strikes are so large that human-scale time periods don't really matter.
138400	142080	The chance of an asteroid strike 200 years from now is more or less the same as it is now.
142720	146960	And similarly, the chance of an asteroid strike 200 years ago is about the same as it is now.
149040	155600	And if you go back a few hundred years, the question becomes very different.
157440	162320	Could we see the asteroid coming? Maybe. Could we do anything about it?
163440	168080	No. I mean, pretty much just flatly no. We didn't have the technology. We didn't have
168080	171840	the understanding of the thing necessary to build something that could deal with that.
174160	179120	If an asteroid were headed for Earth a few hundred years ago, that would just be it.
180080	185840	Just game over. Humanity's done. Shame. You know, you didn't quite develop your technology fast
185840	190560	enough to have anything that could deal with asteroids before one happened to hit you. Oh, well.
191280	199920	There is no rule which says that the challenges the universe faces us with are challenges we can face.
201920	205680	And I hope that kind of gives some taste of what I'm talking about,
205680	211040	of like understanding the possibility that we could be currently faced with challenges
211040	216160	that we will not rise to. That we actually could fail.
216160	222320	But people just have a very hard time taking seriously the possibility that we could fail.
223680	229600	I think it comes from a few different places. One place obviously is religion, right? If we
229600	235600	were created deliberately by the creator of the universe, we are important in the universe.
236880	240880	And so we're not going to be wiped out by some asteroid or whatever. We're not going to be wiped
240880	249120	out in some boring way. Religions, they're often okay with the idea of an apocalypse,
249120	255680	of humanity or of the world ending. But they're not okay with an accidental apocalypse.
255680	260160	They have a very hard time taking that kind of thing seriously. In a religious apocalypse,
260160	263760	it's always part of the plan.
264720	271440	And so someone with a religious mindset, when faced with a scenario in which humanity is wiped
271440	280400	out in a way which is not part of the plan, they have a very hard time taking that seriously.
281200	286080	And I would posit that anyone raised in a society that's primarily religious probably has a lot
286080	292880	of this as well. A lot of this kind of feeling that maybe we face a lot of challenges.
292880	298480	Maybe we face very difficult challenges, but we'll deal with them. And if we don't,
298480	304960	then that's okay because it's all part of the plan. Even if they would not explicitly endorse
304960	311920	this idea, even if they claim to recognize the reality that there is no plan, I think those
311920	316880	lingering ideas don't just immediately disappear when you give up on the supernatural parts of
316880	322000	your religious beliefs and your upbringing. And it's not just capital R religion either, right?
322000	328880	Like anyone who believes that human beings have souls or that human beings are in some way
328880	334800	special, like fundamentally special, that the universe itself has like a separate category
334800	340160	for human beings. Because again, there's this sense in which the universe on some level cares
340160	346480	about us or even just recognizes us or acknowledges us as a thing. And if you believe that, again,
347280	354560	it's difficult to think about the situations in which we're wiped out in some boring way with no
355680	366080	dramatic final test, no heroic last stands, no judgments, no thrilling story to tell,
368240	373920	and nobody to tell it to. So religion is one place that I think this comes from. The other
373920	378640	place that it comes from, I think, is fiction, especially Hollywood and especially science
378640	383120	fiction. And I'm not saying that people can't tell the difference between fiction and reality.
386160	389200	I'm kind of saying that. I mean, on a conscious level, people can tell the difference between
389200	396800	fiction and reality. But I think on some level, it's like people understand that whatever this
396800	402720	fictional thing is, it didn't happen to us. It didn't happen here on earth. But it sort of
402720	407600	happened somewhere. It happened in the world of the story, and that still feels real.
409680	415920	It's kind of like, say you have two people, A and B. In person A says, you know, alcohol is
415920	421680	actually a really harmful drug. I think we should ban alcohol in the UK. In person B might reply,
421680	428160	well, they did try banning alcohol in the USA in the 1920s, and that didn't really work out
428240	432560	at all the way they hoped it would. In person A would reply, well, yeah, but that was a different
432560	437360	time. It was a different place. You know, modern Britain is very different from 1920s America,
437360	441840	and we could implement it differently and so on. In person B would say, yeah, I mean,
441840	446560	maybe there are important differences. But still, the fact that something similar was tried and
446560	451600	failed is evidence against the idea, right? That's useful information to take into consideration.
452880	457440	And that doesn't seem like an unreasonable position to take. But then people would do the
457440	463280	same thing where somebody expresses something about AI, and somebody else says, yeah, but think
463280	470080	about what happened in 2001, a space odyssey or iRobot or something. And you say to them, well,
470080	475680	that was fiction. That didn't happen, right? That's a fictional example. It's different from the real
475680	482000	world. It doesn't really make sense to use that. And they'll say, oh, I know, I know that it's
482000	487120	fictional. But still, there's some sense in which this is like evidence, right?
489200	496000	And no, it's not. I mean, it's, at best, it's one dude's best guess. And usually it's not even that,
496000	500320	because usually the person is not trying to be as accurate as possible. They're trying to be entertaining.
502480	505360	So clearly fiction affects the way people think about this.
507200	511440	It's interesting. It seems like it increases the probabilities people assign to bad things
511440	517360	happening with AI, but it also decreases the probabilities they assign to really, really
517360	523520	bad things happening with AI. In the sense that they have in some part of their mind a whole
523520	530080	bunch of examples in which bad things happened, but then we were able to overcome them, right?
530080	533920	And this is not just with AI. This is any existential risk. Even asteroids, for example,
534720	540480	coming back to them. Even though people often won't explicitly endorse this idea,
541200	546320	I think there's a part of people which says, oh, well, I've seen the world threatened hundreds of
546320	554560	times, right? And every time it works out. There's some, there's a brave hero or a plucky
554560	559200	band of misfits or something comes along. We figure out what we need to do and then we do it.
559200	564720	And I guess that's where we are, you know? And some of those people are even potentially
564720	569840	helpful because they offer to join your plucky band of misfits. But they're still not able to
569840	577200	take seriously the possibility that we might lose because they've never seen that happen,
578080	581200	right? I mean, they've never seen it happen in fiction or very rarely seen it happen in fiction.
581760	587200	And furthermore, they've never seen it happen in reality, obviously. That's kind of a difficult
587200	594480	one because I feel like you should be able to use reality as evidence. But I mean, of course,
594480	599600	we've never observed humanity being wiped out. Wouldn't be here talking about it if we had.
599920	608800	And so it's hard to get people to really feel the reality of the situation,
610000	615600	which is that we, the whole of humanity, we are up here on this tightrope.
617760	626880	We've had no practice, no dry run, no rehearsal. We get one shot and there is no parachute.
626880	633200	There's no safety net. There is no rule that says that we have to make it. We absolutely
633200	641440	can fail. And we will if we don't successfully tackle a series of hard problems. And there's no
641440	647280	rule that says that we're actually capable of tackling those problems. And there's no rule
647280	652240	that says that we have enough time to do so. So we'd better get to work.
