00:00.000 --> 00:07.440
So there's a thing that I see people routinely fail to get and it's a little hard to express.

00:09.120 --> 00:09.920
I'm just going to try.

00:12.320 --> 00:19.760
There's no rule which says that we make it. There's no rule which says that humanity has

00:19.760 --> 00:24.160
to survive this century or even this decade. There's no rule that says that everything's going

00:24.160 --> 00:29.200
to be okay. And when I say this to people they generally accept it. Most of the people I talk

00:29.360 --> 00:33.280
to anyway. They say, yeah of course. Of course there's no rule that says that we have to make it.

00:33.280 --> 00:37.280
Of course humanity could fail. We could go extinct. It could happen.

00:39.920 --> 00:46.320
It's like they know it, but they don't feel it. They don't take it seriously as an actual

00:46.320 --> 00:51.200
possibility. They kind of think, okay we have these things that we have to do. We have these

00:51.200 --> 00:58.720
challenges we have to overcome and so we'll do that. We'll rise to the occasion. We'll figure out

00:58.800 --> 01:05.520
what we need to do and we'll do it. But okay, this is a related concept. There's no rule which

01:05.520 --> 01:10.800
says that the challenges we're faced with are challenges that we are capable of meeting.

01:12.560 --> 01:16.800
Think about something like an asteroid strike. If a big enough asteroid hits earth we're pretty

01:16.800 --> 01:20.240
much done for, right? And I'm not saying that this is something we should day to day be concerned

01:20.240 --> 01:25.760
about because we're dealing with geological periods of time, right? Regularly asteroids hit

01:25.760 --> 01:33.120
earth. We're sort of due for one, but what does that really mean? Sometime in the next

01:33.920 --> 01:38.000
million years or whatever it is. So we have more pressing concerns, but

01:39.680 --> 01:44.480
when people are prepared to take seriously the possibility of an asteroid strike,

01:45.040 --> 01:49.520
usually it's because they're thinking about it like, oh interesting. Okay, so we have good

01:49.520 --> 01:54.720
telescopes. We would spot the thing. I wonder how long we would have. Would that be enough warning?

01:54.720 --> 01:59.280
Would that be enough time for us to build whatever it is that we needed to build to go up there

01:59.280 --> 02:04.320
and redirect it or blow it up or whatever? So they're willing to think about the possibility

02:05.440 --> 02:12.240
from the perspective of tackling the challenge. But the thing is, as I said, the periods of time

02:12.240 --> 02:18.400
that pass between asteroid strikes are so large that human-scale time periods don't really matter.

02:18.400 --> 02:22.080
The chance of an asteroid strike 200 years from now is more or less the same as it is now.

02:22.720 --> 02:26.960
And similarly, the chance of an asteroid strike 200 years ago is about the same as it is now.

02:29.040 --> 02:35.600
And if you go back a few hundred years, the question becomes very different.

02:37.440 --> 02:42.320
Could we see the asteroid coming? Maybe. Could we do anything about it?

02:43.440 --> 02:48.080
No. I mean, pretty much just flatly no. We didn't have the technology. We didn't have

02:48.080 --> 02:51.840
the understanding of the thing necessary to build something that could deal with that.

02:54.160 --> 02:59.120
If an asteroid were headed for Earth a few hundred years ago, that would just be it.

03:00.080 --> 03:05.840
Just game over. Humanity's done. Shame. You know, you didn't quite develop your technology fast

03:05.840 --> 03:10.560
enough to have anything that could deal with asteroids before one happened to hit you. Oh, well.

03:11.280 --> 03:19.920
There is no rule which says that the challenges the universe faces us with are challenges we can face.

03:21.920 --> 03:25.680
And I hope that kind of gives some taste of what I'm talking about,

03:25.680 --> 03:31.040
of like understanding the possibility that we could be currently faced with challenges

03:31.040 --> 03:36.160
that we will not rise to. That we actually could fail.

03:36.160 --> 03:42.320
But people just have a very hard time taking seriously the possibility that we could fail.

03:43.680 --> 03:49.600
I think it comes from a few different places. One place obviously is religion, right? If we

03:49.600 --> 03:55.600
were created deliberately by the creator of the universe, we are important in the universe.

03:56.880 --> 04:00.880
And so we're not going to be wiped out by some asteroid or whatever. We're not going to be wiped

04:00.880 --> 04:09.120
out in some boring way. Religions, they're often okay with the idea of an apocalypse,

04:09.120 --> 04:15.680
of humanity or of the world ending. But they're not okay with an accidental apocalypse.

04:15.680 --> 04:20.160
They have a very hard time taking that kind of thing seriously. In a religious apocalypse,

04:20.160 --> 04:23.760
it's always part of the plan.

04:24.720 --> 04:31.440
And so someone with a religious mindset, when faced with a scenario in which humanity is wiped

04:31.440 --> 04:40.400
out in a way which is not part of the plan, they have a very hard time taking that seriously.

04:41.200 --> 04:46.080
And I would posit that anyone raised in a society that's primarily religious probably has a lot

04:46.080 --> 04:52.880
of this as well. A lot of this kind of feeling that maybe we face a lot of challenges.

04:52.880 --> 04:58.480
Maybe we face very difficult challenges, but we'll deal with them. And if we don't,

04:58.480 --> 05:04.960
then that's okay because it's all part of the plan. Even if they would not explicitly endorse

05:04.960 --> 05:11.920
this idea, even if they claim to recognize the reality that there is no plan, I think those

05:11.920 --> 05:16.880
lingering ideas don't just immediately disappear when you give up on the supernatural parts of

05:16.880 --> 05:22.000
your religious beliefs and your upbringing. And it's not just capital R religion either, right?

05:22.000 --> 05:28.880
Like anyone who believes that human beings have souls or that human beings are in some way

05:28.880 --> 05:34.800
special, like fundamentally special, that the universe itself has like a separate category

05:34.800 --> 05:40.160
for human beings. Because again, there's this sense in which the universe on some level cares

05:40.160 --> 05:46.480
about us or even just recognizes us or acknowledges us as a thing. And if you believe that, again,

05:47.280 --> 05:54.560
it's difficult to think about the situations in which we're wiped out in some boring way with no

05:55.680 --> 06:06.080
dramatic final test, no heroic last stands, no judgments, no thrilling story to tell,

06:08.240 --> 06:13.920
and nobody to tell it to. So religion is one place that I think this comes from. The other

06:13.920 --> 06:18.640
place that it comes from, I think, is fiction, especially Hollywood and especially science

06:18.640 --> 06:23.120
fiction. And I'm not saying that people can't tell the difference between fiction and reality.

06:26.160 --> 06:29.200
I'm kind of saying that. I mean, on a conscious level, people can tell the difference between

06:29.200 --> 06:36.800
fiction and reality. But I think on some level, it's like people understand that whatever this

06:36.800 --> 06:42.720
fictional thing is, it didn't happen to us. It didn't happen here on earth. But it sort of

06:42.720 --> 06:47.600
happened somewhere. It happened in the world of the story, and that still feels real.

06:49.680 --> 06:55.920
It's kind of like, say you have two people, A and B. In person A says, you know, alcohol is

06:55.920 --> 07:01.680
actually a really harmful drug. I think we should ban alcohol in the UK. In person B might reply,

07:01.680 --> 07:08.160
well, they did try banning alcohol in the USA in the 1920s, and that didn't really work out

07:08.240 --> 07:12.560
at all the way they hoped it would. In person A would reply, well, yeah, but that was a different

07:12.560 --> 07:17.360
time. It was a different place. You know, modern Britain is very different from 1920s America,

07:17.360 --> 07:21.840
and we could implement it differently and so on. In person B would say, yeah, I mean,

07:21.840 --> 07:26.560
maybe there are important differences. But still, the fact that something similar was tried and

07:26.560 --> 07:31.600
failed is evidence against the idea, right? That's useful information to take into consideration.

07:32.880 --> 07:37.440
And that doesn't seem like an unreasonable position to take. But then people would do the

07:37.440 --> 07:43.280
same thing where somebody expresses something about AI, and somebody else says, yeah, but think

07:43.280 --> 07:50.080
about what happened in 2001, a space odyssey or iRobot or something. And you say to them, well,

07:50.080 --> 07:55.680
that was fiction. That didn't happen, right? That's a fictional example. It's different from the real

07:55.680 --> 08:02.000
world. It doesn't really make sense to use that. And they'll say, oh, I know, I know that it's

08:02.000 --> 08:07.120
fictional. But still, there's some sense in which this is like evidence, right?

08:09.200 --> 08:16.000
And no, it's not. I mean, it's, at best, it's one dude's best guess. And usually it's not even that,

08:16.000 --> 08:20.320
because usually the person is not trying to be as accurate as possible. They're trying to be entertaining.

08:22.480 --> 08:25.360
So clearly fiction affects the way people think about this.

08:27.200 --> 08:31.440
It's interesting. It seems like it increases the probabilities people assign to bad things

08:31.440 --> 08:37.360
happening with AI, but it also decreases the probabilities they assign to really, really

08:37.360 --> 08:43.520
bad things happening with AI. In the sense that they have in some part of their mind a whole

08:43.520 --> 08:50.080
bunch of examples in which bad things happened, but then we were able to overcome them, right?

08:50.080 --> 08:53.920
And this is not just with AI. This is any existential risk. Even asteroids, for example,

08:54.720 --> 09:00.480
coming back to them. Even though people often won't explicitly endorse this idea,

09:01.200 --> 09:06.320
I think there's a part of people which says, oh, well, I've seen the world threatened hundreds of

09:06.320 --> 09:14.560
times, right? And every time it works out. There's some, there's a brave hero or a plucky

09:14.560 --> 09:19.200
band of misfits or something comes along. We figure out what we need to do and then we do it.

09:19.200 --> 09:24.720
And I guess that's where we are, you know? And some of those people are even potentially

09:24.720 --> 09:29.840
helpful because they offer to join your plucky band of misfits. But they're still not able to

09:29.840 --> 09:37.200
take seriously the possibility that we might lose because they've never seen that happen,

09:38.080 --> 09:41.200
right? I mean, they've never seen it happen in fiction or very rarely seen it happen in fiction.

09:41.760 --> 09:47.200
And furthermore, they've never seen it happen in reality, obviously. That's kind of a difficult

09:47.200 --> 09:54.480
one because I feel like you should be able to use reality as evidence. But I mean, of course,

09:54.480 --> 09:59.600
we've never observed humanity being wiped out. Wouldn't be here talking about it if we had.

09:59.920 --> 10:08.800
And so it's hard to get people to really feel the reality of the situation,

10:10.000 --> 10:15.600
which is that we, the whole of humanity, we are up here on this tightrope.

10:17.760 --> 10:26.880
We've had no practice, no dry run, no rehearsal. We get one shot and there is no parachute.

10:26.880 --> 10:33.200
There's no safety net. There is no rule that says that we have to make it. We absolutely

10:33.200 --> 10:41.440
can fail. And we will if we don't successfully tackle a series of hard problems. And there's no

10:41.440 --> 10:47.280
rule that says that we're actually capable of tackling those problems. And there's no rule

10:47.280 --> 10:52.240
that says that we have enough time to do so. So we'd better get to work.
