00:00.000 --> 00:27.080
Welcome to Topcast and to the long-awaited, or at least often mentioned, Episode 100.

00:27.080 --> 00:32.000
This here is finally my interview with David in full, unabridged form.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.920
It contains all my questions for David and multiple more questions.

00:35.920 --> 00:39.800
This is basically an audio-only podcast, there are no visuals today.

00:39.800 --> 00:43.960
My friend recently told me that he doesn't like it when I say to audio-only listeners

00:43.960 --> 00:48.480
that the YouTube version is sometimes better because I put lots of pretty visuals in it.

00:48.480 --> 00:52.800
He says that he listens while he's out walking or jogging and can't look at a screen.

00:52.800 --> 00:55.720
Well today, Adam, you don't need to worry about that.

00:55.720 --> 00:59.920
And to all the other Adams out there who I think outnumber the YouTube viewers by about

00:59.920 --> 01:06.560
a 10 to 1 ratio, I'll keep in mind, moving forward as we say, that so many of you only

01:06.560 --> 01:09.560
listen and don't watch screens.

01:09.560 --> 01:15.440
Perhaps it would be more fair if it was a 10 to 1 ratio of audio-only to visually important

01:15.440 --> 01:17.600
podcast from now on, we'll see.

01:17.600 --> 01:23.480
So this episode is, I have to say up front, rather an astonishing personal accomplishment

01:23.480 --> 01:24.640
for me.

01:24.640 --> 01:26.840
Everyone has people they admire growing up.

01:26.840 --> 01:31.440
Among my peer group, like any group of school kids I guess, the common thing was looking

01:31.440 --> 01:35.160
up to famous sports stars or music idols or movie stars.

01:35.160 --> 01:37.960
I know I idolized Arnold Schwarzenegger.

01:37.960 --> 01:42.160
This was back in his early days of doing movies, not his more recent political stuff.

01:42.160 --> 01:47.560
Back then he was quite the optimist and his personal story was easily as heroic as any

01:47.720 --> 01:49.800
of his on-screen characters.

01:49.800 --> 01:52.240
Nevertheless, I was never under any illusions.

01:52.240 --> 01:56.240
I'd ever get to meet Arnold, much less have a conversation with him.

01:56.240 --> 01:59.240
I lived in Australia in the southwestern suburbs of Sydney.

01:59.240 --> 02:03.880
It's not the place to come across movie stars, sports celebrities, singers or accomplished

02:03.880 --> 02:06.120
scientists for the most part.

02:06.120 --> 02:12.000
But happily for me, some intellectual heroes of mine were accessible by pure chance and

02:12.000 --> 02:13.760
circumstance in some cases.

02:13.760 --> 02:18.000
I've mentioned before on this podcast that Professor Paul Davies, author of The Mind

02:18.000 --> 02:24.000
of God and many other books, produced a couple of physics documentary series here in Australia

02:24.000 --> 02:25.760
called The Big Questions.

02:25.760 --> 02:30.840
He also used to write articles for local news outlets and he appeared on TV here rather regularly

02:30.840 --> 02:33.400
when he did live here in Australia for a time.

02:33.400 --> 02:38.160
I read, listened to and watched anything and everything Professor Davies ever put out there

02:38.160 --> 02:44.000
that I could find and early on he was the guy, my scientific hero so to speak.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.400
He seemed to know everything for some reason, so it was an amazing stroke of luck when one

02:48.400 --> 02:51.320
day he just happened to turn up, unannounced.

02:51.320 --> 02:56.240
At an event I was helping to host at university, I got his autograph, I actually got his autograph

02:56.240 --> 02:59.400
on my philosophy uni notes as it turned out.

02:59.400 --> 03:00.640
Not one of his books.

03:00.640 --> 03:05.720
The name of the subject in which the uni notes were compiled was called God, Life, the Universe

03:05.760 --> 03:09.880
and everything which was right up his alley and the lecture notes actually had excerpts

03:09.880 --> 03:12.080
from one of his books that I proudly showed him.

03:12.080 --> 03:14.640
I was literally studying his stuff at the time.

03:14.640 --> 03:18.800
So I ended up having a brief conversation with Paul Davies, winner of the Templeton Prize

03:18.800 --> 03:22.440
and I kind of thought that in my early 20s this was a pretty good accomplishment for

03:22.440 --> 03:26.640
an undergrad physics student still living with their parents in an exceedingly typical

03:26.640 --> 03:32.160
home on a typical street and a typical suburb, one among hundreds in greater Sydney, Australia.

03:32.160 --> 03:37.600
I guess to put it in perspective it would have been rather like an aspiring pop singer

03:37.600 --> 03:42.760
just happening to bump into Michael Jackson or Madonna or for younger listeners Justin

03:42.760 --> 03:43.760
Bieber.

03:43.760 --> 03:48.640
So that was the late 90s by which time I'd already read The Fabric of Reality by David

03:48.640 --> 03:53.920
Deutsch multiple times and the remarkable thing about having read that book was that

03:53.920 --> 03:56.280
I just had to talk about it with someone.

03:56.280 --> 04:00.480
I think many people who read the book end up feeling that way, it's kind of unique

04:00.480 --> 04:01.480
in that respect.

04:01.480 --> 04:02.800
It doesn't happen often.

04:02.800 --> 04:07.040
As much as I loved Paul Davies books I never really felt a need to disgust them with groups

04:07.040 --> 04:10.160
of people but David's book was different.

04:10.160 --> 04:12.760
But sadly there was no one to really talk to about it.

04:12.760 --> 04:17.480
At university the people around me, even in my physics lectures, just didn't seem to

04:17.480 --> 04:18.840
get the significance of it.

04:18.840 --> 04:21.200
Well of course they hadn't read it to begin with.

04:21.200 --> 04:26.480
At the same time I was reformulating my own thoughts from decades of schooling and some

04:26.480 --> 04:31.920
years of tertiary education in light of what The Fabric of Reality was saying about the

04:31.920 --> 04:33.360
nature of knowledge and so on.

04:33.360 --> 04:38.200
I was converted by that book to the many worlds interpretation of quantum theory.

04:38.200 --> 04:39.520
In other words, realism.

04:39.520 --> 04:41.920
I was converted to popurian epistemology.

04:41.920 --> 04:47.200
In other words, I had some insight into what knowledge actually was and how it was created.

04:47.200 --> 04:52.120
But whenever I mentioned either of those things, let's say many worlds to a physics tutor

04:52.120 --> 04:57.600
or professor or popper to a philosophy tutor or professor, I barely ever got more than

04:57.600 --> 05:02.480
a shrug or maybe a hint that I should go and read about Bohmian mechanics or maybe take

05:02.480 --> 05:07.400
more seriously what Feynman had to say about understanding quantum theory or in the case

05:07.400 --> 05:12.760
of popper to look more deeply into the Vienna circle and what Wittgenstein had to say on

05:12.760 --> 05:14.800
the matters that Popper was writing about.

05:14.800 --> 05:18.800
In other words, in both cases there were not many sympathetic ears.

05:18.800 --> 05:23.760
Now I cannot remember exactly how it happened, and this is in the era before Google, but

05:23.760 --> 05:28.800
some search engine or other allowed me to eventually find myself online in the late

05:28.800 --> 05:35.400
90s and the early 2000s able to, now and again, fire a question to David Deutch himself via

05:35.400 --> 05:37.960
email about The Fabric of Reality.

05:37.960 --> 05:42.960
I was astonished that he was the guy, the inventor of quantum computation, that seemingly

05:42.960 --> 05:47.920
no one much knew about, but seemed to know a heck of a lot more and make considerably

05:47.920 --> 05:54.400
more sense than anyone else I'd ever encountered in academia or intellectual circles.

05:54.400 --> 06:00.600
I was one of the privileged few in retrospect who knew a second book was on the way, though

06:00.600 --> 06:05.120
we never knew what it would be called nor when it would arrive, but the anticipation

06:05.120 --> 06:08.680
grew over the decade until finally it was published.

06:08.680 --> 06:14.480
I think perhaps only Star Wars fans waiting for the next canonic film to drop know exactly

06:14.480 --> 06:15.480
that same feeling.

06:15.560 --> 06:17.600
Well, even in that case they don't really.

06:17.600 --> 06:23.120
Films are a transient thing, but a book, like The Beginning of Infinity, is kind of bottomless

06:23.120 --> 06:26.760
in a way that no other consumable content quite is.

06:26.760 --> 06:31.880
So I've been a fan of David Deutch for decades now, so it still blows my mind that I could

06:31.880 --> 06:37.600
be in a position to actually just have a chat with him as we do here, albeit from the other

06:37.600 --> 06:43.520
side of the world, and on that, me being far closer to Antarctica than most of the population

06:43.520 --> 06:48.040
of the planet, and most people who are listening to this will be far closer to the Arctic,

06:48.040 --> 06:53.720
the finiteness of the speed of light did catch David and I out on more than one occasion,

06:53.720 --> 06:59.360
making this episode, in some places, a little bit disjointed so editing was required for

06:59.360 --> 07:03.600
listenability in some places, but hopefully I've done a good enough job that you don't

07:03.600 --> 07:04.600
notice.

07:04.600 --> 07:06.200
I'm not a polished interviewer, of course.

07:06.200 --> 07:11.440
This seemed to be half conversation, half interview, and I have learned now on putting

07:11.440 --> 07:16.080
this together to not speak over the person I am talking to, or try to fill pauses with

07:16.080 --> 07:17.840
noises of agreement.

07:17.840 --> 07:22.320
I have learned those lessons now, but I did not know them beforehand, which means there

07:22.320 --> 07:27.080
are some places where I do seem to forget I am being recorded.

07:27.080 --> 07:32.320
As this is episode 100, a sort of announcement is in order, that being that Topcast will

07:32.320 --> 07:38.280
continue to go from strength to strength in a space of podcast that seems to expand continuously,

07:38.280 --> 07:42.080
but I think there is a nice little niche here that needs to be filled, so I'll continue

07:42.080 --> 07:47.440
doing what I do, but with more energy thanks to the support of Patreons, and especially

07:47.440 --> 07:53.120
of course to Navarre Ravacart, who's own worldview and wisdom aligns so closely with

07:53.120 --> 07:58.000
the optimism, view of progress, and wealth of David Deutsch, and what I am trying to

07:58.000 --> 07:59.120
promote here.

07:59.120 --> 08:04.720
So I'll continue doing what I do, which is long form podcasts, especially on Deutsch's

08:04.720 --> 08:09.600
The Fabric of Reality, Marletto's The Science of Can and Can't, and Pinker's Rationality

08:09.600 --> 08:10.600
for now.

08:10.600 --> 08:16.040
But I'll also be broadening out and refining things, making lots more stand alone episodes

08:16.040 --> 08:21.360
and really tightening things up on some of the ideas we like to talk about here, and making

08:21.360 --> 08:25.400
far more brief podcasts as well.

08:25.400 --> 08:29.160
And maybe now and again I'll do the odd recorded conversation once in a while.

08:29.160 --> 08:34.680
So look forward to that in the coming weeks and months and years if you're a fan.

08:34.680 --> 08:38.360
This introduction is already longer than I hoped for, but I actually haven't done a

08:38.360 --> 08:43.200
job of introduction, which I should do in an episode like this, I need to introduce

08:43.200 --> 08:44.200
my guest.

08:44.200 --> 08:47.760
But of course David needs no introduction, especially if you're listening to this as

08:47.760 --> 08:55.600
a subscriber of Topcast, because Topcast is largely a podcast devoted to the work and

08:55.600 --> 09:00.880
worldview of David Deutsch, the inventor of the theory of quantum computation, author

09:00.880 --> 09:05.600
of the first quantum algorithm, intellectual successor to the epistemology and philosophy

09:05.600 --> 09:10.480
of Karl Popper, author of The Fabric of Reality and The Beginning of Infinity, creator of

09:10.480 --> 09:15.440
Constructor Theory, David is a Fellow of the Royal Society, winner of the Dirac Prize

09:15.440 --> 09:22.560
in 1998 for quote, pioneering work in quantum computation leading to the concept of a quantum

09:22.560 --> 09:27.960
computer and for contributing to the understanding of how such devices might be constructed from

09:28.040 --> 09:30.880
quantum gates in quantum networks.

09:30.880 --> 09:37.360
And he was also the co-winner of the Dirac Medal in 2017 for quote, building the foundations

09:37.360 --> 09:39.960
of quantum information science.

09:39.960 --> 09:43.680
His books have won prizes and he has won other prizes as well.

09:43.680 --> 09:47.960
Go to his website and the about me section to find out more about all that.

09:47.960 --> 09:53.040
But as I record this, I've just learned that this week, the final week of November 2021,

09:53.040 --> 09:57.760
David has won the Isaac Newton Medal from the Institute of Physics in the United Kingdom

09:57.760 --> 10:05.320
for quote, founding the discipline named quantum computation and establishing quantum computations

10:05.320 --> 10:10.280
fundamental idea now known as the qubit or quantum bit end quote.

10:10.280 --> 10:14.200
He has now also been elected a Fellow of that Institute of Physics.

10:14.200 --> 10:19.880
Prizes, accolades and accomplishments aside, the impact of David Deutsch on the world is

10:19.880 --> 10:25.760
yet to be fully realized, but it is going to become perhaps something like that of an

10:25.760 --> 10:30.760
Einstein or a Newton or a Darwin in my opinion, which is why we're so lucky to be able to

10:30.760 --> 10:33.560
interrogate him once in a while.

10:33.560 --> 10:38.000
Once the first fully functional universal quantum computer is built, the landscape of

10:38.000 --> 10:39.280
the world will change.

10:39.280 --> 10:43.640
When the average person understands and appreciates that its function can only be explained by

10:43.640 --> 10:47.520
recourse to a multiverse, the intellectual world will change.

10:47.520 --> 10:52.080
When people look back in retrospect and realize he was right all along in what he said about

10:52.080 --> 10:58.760
quantum computation and therefore about explanations and hence popper, the world will be changed.

10:58.760 --> 11:03.760
We can only hope that that change goes deeper still into how the education of young people

11:03.760 --> 11:09.160
is handled, how we deal with problems both known and unknown and why progress, optimism

11:09.160 --> 11:14.040
and wealth need to motivate us all individually and as a civilization.

11:14.040 --> 11:18.360
The world will be changed and we will see that what I've just said about putting David

11:18.360 --> 11:23.400
alongside the biggest names in science and philosophy is neither hyperbole or hubris.

11:23.400 --> 11:24.600
It is a serious claim.

11:24.600 --> 11:27.880
I just wish it would all happen far sooner.

11:27.880 --> 11:29.720
But that's enough of an introduction.

11:29.720 --> 11:32.920
I'll have a few brief remarks at the end of this.

11:32.920 --> 11:38.880
But for now, I present to you my interview, my discussion, my conversation with David

11:38.880 --> 11:42.880
Dodge.

11:42.880 --> 11:45.960
Okay, well thanks very much anyway for doing this David.

11:45.960 --> 11:52.040
It's a real honor to talk to you and be able to record this conversation.

11:52.040 --> 11:59.120
And this book that I've spent the last few years exploring now is unlike just about any

11:59.120 --> 12:03.680
other to my mind and I've said this a few times that it's unlike other popular science

12:03.680 --> 12:06.960
books because it's not really a popular science book.

12:06.960 --> 12:11.560
One thing that it contains within it that is different to other science books is what

12:11.560 --> 12:17.120
I might say are sort of discoveries in philosophy and physics or at the very least new ways

12:17.120 --> 12:22.680
of refining and explaining material you've put out there elsewhere in other forms perhaps.

12:22.680 --> 12:27.280
The first time this seems to crop up actually is in chapter one, the reach of explanations

12:27.280 --> 12:32.520
and there we get the concept of good explanations, good explanations being actual explanations

12:32.520 --> 12:35.400
that account for what is out there in the world and how it works.

12:35.400 --> 12:39.400
That are hard to vary, these hard to vary explanations.

12:39.400 --> 12:45.040
Now I'm convinced and most people who hear about it become convinced over time but I

12:45.040 --> 12:49.200
think there's a lot of people who think well science isn't it just about testable theories?

12:49.200 --> 12:51.960
Why isn't testable theories enough?

12:51.960 --> 12:59.880
So there was a lot about explanations even in my first book and some careful readers

13:00.240 --> 13:08.280
pointed out that I'd never actually explained what an explanation is in Fabrica reality.

13:08.280 --> 13:15.160
In fact I seem to have taken a bit of a cop out path by saying just saying about explanations

13:15.160 --> 13:22.720
that there isn't any closed list of attributes that an explanation must have and that's because

13:22.720 --> 13:28.200
it seemed to me that and I think it does seem to many people that the difference between

13:28.200 --> 13:39.200
an explanation and a prediction is obvious but to most people it was quite opaque.

13:39.200 --> 13:44.600
So I thought about it and this is indeed one of the few things that I will acknowledge

13:44.600 --> 13:51.040
is kind of a bit of an innovation in the beginning of infinity.

13:51.040 --> 14:00.200
I thought about what exactly makes the difference and I thought of some examples such as the

14:00.200 --> 14:05.560
explanation of the seasons as opposed to predicting them and then I think that the example that

14:05.560 --> 14:15.160
I like best although again not everyone does is the example of the conjurer where you go

14:15.320 --> 14:23.920
in and you go in to see this conjuring performance and you see some cups and balls and the conjurer

14:23.920 --> 14:30.960
puts the ball under the cup and after a while you begin to predict that the cup where he

14:30.960 --> 14:33.960
puts the ball under is not going to be the one where it ends up.

14:33.960 --> 14:37.640
But that doesn't mean you can explain what's going on in the trick.

14:37.640 --> 14:44.760
Yeah exactly so you can predict quite confidently that the ball isn't there and there you are

14:44.840 --> 14:51.000
it's vindicated but that's not what you mean by how is the trick done.

14:51.000 --> 15:00.520
What you mean is what has happened to bring about the thing you saw and so you're not asking for

15:00.520 --> 15:06.600
an account of the thing you saw even a perfect prediction of the thing you saw you're asking

15:06.600 --> 15:08.600
about the thing you didn't see.

15:08.600 --> 15:14.680
Yes and this comes up so often throughout the book really and I think it's a subtle

15:14.680 --> 15:21.400
point easily missed and of course the other example that you use and that you often go to is

15:21.400 --> 15:27.320
this idea of dinosaurs the one thing that you actually can't observe is indeed the one thing

15:27.320 --> 15:31.800
that you're invoking as actually existing and causing the phenomena that you do observe.

15:33.640 --> 15:37.800
And in all these cases that unobserved thing is the thing that you're really interested in.

15:37.800 --> 15:42.040
It's the only reason you're interested in any kind of prediction at all.

15:42.040 --> 15:49.720
Yes and now this concept of then hard to vary where all the parts of the explanation have some

15:49.720 --> 15:55.560
functional role and this is really what makes the explanation a good explanation as opposed to

15:56.200 --> 16:01.640
any arbitrary account that could be easily varied mythological accounts and so on magical accounts.

16:02.360 --> 16:07.480
Did that come to you did you have that in mind during the fabric of reality writing it then or

16:07.480 --> 16:12.280
did it only come later in light of people saying you know can you sharpen up what you mean by

16:12.280 --> 16:19.480
explanation. It's the latter I like I said while I was writing fabric of reality I kind of thought

16:19.480 --> 16:25.560
that these were rather foolishly I thought that these were words that had an uncontroversial

16:25.560 --> 16:34.520
meaning and it didn't occur to me that that that most people would not have this meaning in mind

16:34.600 --> 16:40.920
although many people did so in that sense it wasn't something I invented

16:41.640 --> 16:49.480
something that I realized needs to be elaborated to be written down more clearly

16:50.200 --> 16:54.680
and then I started to think about well things that are explanations and things that aren't explanations

16:55.480 --> 17:01.400
and like the ancient myths and so on and and then I thought with the with the conjurer

17:02.360 --> 17:09.800
there are circumstances where the conjurer did it is the explanation that the person wants

17:09.800 --> 17:18.440
yes you can imagine a person who believes in magic and is is sort of slowly coming out of that

17:18.440 --> 17:27.320
state of mind like like James Randi's family when the historian when he was a teenager and when he

17:27.320 --> 17:35.560
first exposed a fake psychic and and was horrified to find that most of the people in the audience

17:35.560 --> 17:40.840
didn't want to know the truth yeah right yeah that happened more than once there was a famous I don't

17:40.840 --> 17:44.760
know if you know the famous story that he was on Australian television he did the same to the

17:44.760 --> 17:51.400
spoon bender Yuri Geller on one of our daytime lunchtime talk back television shows and the

17:51.400 --> 17:55.800
audience was very upset with him and indeed the host was as well and stormed off the set he did

17:55.800 --> 18:04.840
the same thing to Randy wow right so there there you have it I mean that that anger would happen

18:05.560 --> 18:12.360
I suppose whether or not he revealed how he did it it was the fact that he was revealing that he

18:12.360 --> 18:19.640
did do it that was the thing that angered them and that that was the relevant explanation in context

18:19.640 --> 18:27.080
so that's why I have to say it's an explanation is hard to vary while still solving the problem

18:27.080 --> 18:32.840
that it purports to solve yes which might be different for different people as well in the same

18:32.840 --> 18:38.360
situation okay so you mentioned that that piece of sort of prosaic terminology explanation that

18:39.400 --> 18:44.200
we all use but I think that you've put a spin on it that is is quite helpful but

18:44.280 --> 18:49.320
turning to another word a word that you in fact don't use and it brings me to chapter two

18:49.960 --> 18:53.320
and that's called and don't worry I'm not going to go through every single chapter chronologically

18:53.320 --> 18:59.880
but uh then just a few of them um but chapter two is titled closer to reality but Karl Popper

18:59.880 --> 19:06.040
had this term very silamitude which means something like closer to truth and it seems to me you've

19:06.040 --> 19:12.040
deliberately avoided that word but why is it because it contains a misconception it's misleading or

19:12.040 --> 19:17.480
it's a needless neologism what would be the reason to avoid such a word I think all of those things

19:17.480 --> 19:22.040
and I think even even Popper I don't know the history of this very well but I think even Popper

19:22.040 --> 19:31.320
went off it Popper in general was very into logic uh this is I think partly uh a sign of the times

19:31.320 --> 19:38.120
that that uh the people who were uh doing the prevailing philosophy of science at the time

19:38.200 --> 19:43.880
and positivism and logical positivism many of them were logicians and mathematical logicians

19:43.880 --> 19:51.320
even Popper wanted a Popper originally uh didn't want to even to mention truth at all

19:51.960 --> 19:57.960
and then he got converted by by Tarski and he tells a story uh about how they were sitting

19:57.960 --> 20:03.160
on a park bench in Vienna and Tarski explained the correspondence theory of truth to him and he

20:03.160 --> 20:10.440
realized that this is this is in fact a useful concept after all but I wonder what logical

20:10.440 --> 20:15.320
scientific discovery would have looked like if he had in fact written the whole of it without

20:15.320 --> 20:22.440
ever mentioning truth I think it it would have been worse in some ways in that it's it's difficult

20:22.440 --> 20:28.920
to make the case for realism if you don't have a concept of truth and Popper was very keen to

20:28.920 --> 20:35.480
formulate a realistic philosophy of science but on the other hand when you do introduce truth and

20:35.480 --> 20:43.000
especially verisimilitude then the idea is that somehow we can utter truth or at least we can

20:43.000 --> 20:48.360
utter something that's 90 true or something like that and we'd have thereby a method of measuring

20:48.360 --> 20:53.400
that 90 percent I think verisimilitude was was not intended to be something you could measure

20:53.480 --> 21:00.280
right but uh if if you can't measure it then its only use is a sort of philosophical

21:01.160 --> 21:10.600
regulating principle and uh I think knowledge and problems are much better concepts probably

21:10.600 --> 21:18.200
Popper's fundamental concept the way the way it turned out when when after all these experiments

21:18.200 --> 21:23.800
with different conceptual frameworks or whatever well it is the idea of a problem because that

21:23.800 --> 21:30.920
comes up not only in his philosophy of science but in his political philosophy as well and more

21:30.920 --> 21:41.960
generally he he he generalizes it to even the problem situation of a gene now I'm not sure even

21:41.960 --> 21:49.400
I would go that far but it's a very unifying concept and on the other hand I don't think

21:49.400 --> 21:58.920
verisimilitude is useful at all and as I said even truth one has to be very careful to to use the

21:58.920 --> 22:07.160
concept of truth only as a property of abstractions and never as something you can actually measure

22:07.160 --> 22:15.960
or or know have have a direct access to so therefore would you avoid even saying that

22:16.920 --> 22:21.960
scientific explanations or indeed explanations in any domain that we happen to be interested in

22:21.960 --> 22:28.040
would even be approximately true because that would also entail some kind of quantitative

22:28.040 --> 22:33.080
claim about how close we are or can we still use that word can we still say it's approximately true

22:33.080 --> 22:40.200
or it's a it's there's some degree of accuracy in this claim about I think we we can use it

22:40.200 --> 22:47.560
because again depending on the problem situation if one is speaking informally then one can use

22:48.120 --> 22:54.840
imprecise terminology I just caught myself just a moment ago saying probably so you know I'm

22:54.840 --> 23:01.480
generally opposed to the whole concept of probability I think it's a scam yes but but that

23:01.480 --> 23:06.680
doesn't mean that in in everyday life we don't know what we mean when we're saying some

23:07.960 --> 23:13.960
proper was probably meant so and so I don't mean that there was a stochastic process where he

23:14.680 --> 23:21.400
where he could have meant something else with with the probability 0.15 yeah I often find

23:21.400 --> 23:27.880
myself catching myself precisely the same way that you said generally it kind of has left my

23:27.880 --> 23:33.960
vocabulary in just in day-to-day life using the word probably but I at the same time I don't

23:34.600 --> 23:39.080
you know chastise myself too much because in order to communicate normally you know people

23:39.080 --> 23:45.480
are going to use this word they understand I think yes what we mean and there is no such thing as a

23:45.480 --> 23:52.680
perfectly precise language yes so we want to use terms and ways of understanding things that are

23:52.680 --> 24:00.680
suitable to the problem that would bring me to my next question describing people for example as

24:00.680 --> 24:05.000
chemical scum might be a very loose way of understanding what people are but Hawking did it

24:05.000 --> 24:12.680
and you have an excellent refutation of this claim that Stephen Hawking did make which seems to be

24:12.680 --> 24:19.320
the reasonably scientific way of understanding our place in the universe he said that we are just a

24:19.320 --> 24:24.920
chemical scum on the surface of a typical planet orbiting a typical star and so on but you say

24:24.920 --> 24:32.040
this place is not typical is it in in what sense isn't it typical I think the the the description of

24:32.040 --> 24:40.200
humans as a chemical scum on earth is not accurate in the problem situation in which Hawking used

24:40.200 --> 24:50.760
that term it's we are certainly made of chemicals but so is the rest of the earth and so so is all

24:50.760 --> 25:01.320
other so is all other matter in the universe so to single us out as a scum in in these if you're

25:01.320 --> 25:09.320
going to take these terms in the context of trying to describe something purely in terms in reductionist

25:09.320 --> 25:17.960
terms of their constituents then it is simply false to add a pejorative term that pejorative

25:17.960 --> 25:26.120
term comes from a different problem situation and a different vocabulary is needed it would be enough

25:26.120 --> 25:33.080
to say we are chemicals like everything else in the universe and then you see that it would be

25:33.080 --> 25:38.760
silly to call the earth a chemical scum or the sun or the solar system or the milky way galaxy

25:39.480 --> 25:47.000
as as a chemical scum though in the sense in which we are it is too so we are a a special a

25:47.000 --> 25:54.840
very special kind of chemical but then would that entail that the earth is special by virtue of the

25:54.840 --> 26:02.920
fact that it is uniquely suited to ensuring that this set of chemicals called us is able to survive

26:03.240 --> 26:10.680
off into some future that we are only sustained by the existence of this planet and we'll only

26:10.680 --> 26:14.840
continue to be sustained by this planet so therefore we better look after the environment or else

26:15.400 --> 26:22.840
we're going to go extinct yeah so you're putting that in a in a deliberately exaggerated way that

26:22.840 --> 26:28.680
makes it much more wrong you could have said that with one tenth the emphasis and it would still be

26:28.680 --> 26:37.640
wrong now it's true that the earth is is that living things can exist on earth only by virtue of

26:37.640 --> 26:46.600
the fact that the earth provides by astronomical standards a very unusual set of circumstances

26:46.600 --> 26:54.200
which if if they were to vary by astronomical standards by only a few percent then without

26:54.280 --> 27:00.920
a lot of technology we would die and living things in general would die without technological

27:00.920 --> 27:10.520
help but that doesn't at all mean that the earth is adapted to human existence or even to life but

27:10.520 --> 27:19.640
especially to human existence very accurately it it it would be more true to say that the earth

27:19.640 --> 27:31.160
is barely suitable for life it it provides a relatively stable temperature and sunlight

27:31.160 --> 27:38.760
and living things manage to use that even though it's not very conveniently provided

27:38.760 --> 27:47.400
and that that took it hundreds of millions of years to work out and the rest was provided by

27:47.400 --> 27:56.680
life itself and most of the rest as far as humans go was provided by humans there there are very

27:56.680 --> 28:06.680
very few places on earth that humans can live comfortably without technology that is without

28:07.240 --> 28:14.840
ideas provided by them and not provided by the earth so i don't know maybe some south sea islands

28:15.640 --> 28:22.680
with suitable coconuts or whatever they have there and even that would be a trap

28:22.680 --> 28:30.280
because we are so constituted that if we did live in such an environment for some generations

28:30.280 --> 28:36.440
our numbers would increase to the point when we will live it where we were living in misery again

28:37.000 --> 28:46.120
so the earth is where living on earth what has been provided is really just the bare

28:46.120 --> 28:52.440
necessities for us to live somewhere originally the great lift rift valley or something and the

28:52.440 --> 29:01.320
rest has to be provided by us yes so the earth is not adapted to life but life can adapt itself to

29:01.320 --> 29:08.040
the earth but the only thing that is going to survive in the long run in terms of regular life

29:08.040 --> 29:11.960
not intelligent life like ourselves are the genes the genes are going to want to try and

29:11.960 --> 29:18.840
make themselves survive and the animals won't care or the other species don't have this concept of

29:18.840 --> 29:26.600
caring into the infinite future about their own survival however we do so we want to adapt ourselves

29:26.600 --> 29:33.720
to the earth in some way or if not the earth and something far larger we want to adapt ourselves

29:33.720 --> 29:39.000
to the universe in which we find ourselves and the one thing that enables us to do that is of

29:39.000 --> 29:45.320
course solving our problems continually to create the knowledge in order to enable us to do so and

29:45.320 --> 29:52.600
you have the great dichotomy of saying problems are inevitable but problems are soluble and here

29:53.160 --> 29:58.840
i have heard over the years people push back against this especially the second part that

29:58.840 --> 30:06.040
problems are soluble for example they argue we can't know everything and they will invoke

30:06.040 --> 30:11.160
that it's provably the case that given girdle's result there are true statements we cannot prove

30:11.160 --> 30:16.440
are true so there is some and there are some mathematics that's not decidable so some problems

30:16.440 --> 30:21.960
are not soluble isn't isn't that correct what's the what's the argument against that line of

30:21.960 --> 30:32.120
reasoning i i think that the this line of reasoning is reaching for a standard of knowing

30:32.120 --> 30:39.080
that is impossible for anything it's it's not possible to know even provable things by the

30:39.080 --> 30:44.760
standard that they're asking to know unprovable things when we say that something is provable

30:45.320 --> 30:53.640
we mean that it's provable from certain axioms and girdle's theorem is about provability which

30:53.640 --> 31:01.320
means provability from axioms now if you if you have an undecidable statement in some formal system

31:01.320 --> 31:07.560
and if it was true you could always add that as another axiom and then it would be provable

31:08.280 --> 31:13.480
so you might ask yeah but but how do we know that that statement you're adding is true

31:14.120 --> 31:21.560
if we can't prove it well unfortunately that objection applies to any set of axioms and it

31:21.560 --> 31:29.560
applies to the original set of axioms as well and uh this is this is uh a mistake that has been made

31:29.560 --> 31:36.600
by many mathematicians even after girdle i think it was made by virtually all mathematicians before

31:36.600 --> 31:46.280
girdle but even after mathematicians tend to think that there is a class of axioms that don't

31:46.280 --> 31:53.480
need proof or something that that they are self proving or self self evident or they come from

31:53.480 --> 32:00.680
mathematical intuition which is infallible or something like that but in fact the the axioms

32:00.680 --> 32:09.000
the rules of inference in logic that for example if the proposition a and b is true then it is

32:09.000 --> 32:17.560
necessarily the case that b is also true now it seems self-evident but uh it is not provable

32:17.560 --> 32:24.920
so uh what are you going to do are you going to say that this is a problem that is insoluble

32:24.920 --> 32:30.520
and therefore it's not true that problems are soluble no people don't don't bother saying it with

32:31.080 --> 32:37.240
with axioms because they have this misconception that axioms are somehow enshrined by god or

32:37.240 --> 32:43.880
something and we can know for sure that they are true yes but that's not what knowledge is about

32:43.880 --> 32:49.800
we are trying to solve problems we're not trying to establish truths and uh girdle's

32:49.880 --> 32:55.480
yes uh theorem is not about establishing truth either it's about deriving things from other

32:55.480 --> 33:04.040
things yes yes and these some one uh line of discussion i often pursue here and correct me

33:04.040 --> 33:12.680
if i'm wrong but this vast class of undecidable or unprovable statements which must vastly out

33:12.680 --> 33:20.360
number the number that are provable statements they're in a sense uninteresting because that's

33:20.360 --> 33:27.800
not what the claims of science physics for example consist of and so they don't have

33:27.800 --> 33:33.080
and again i would i would appeal to your better knowledge on this they don't have any they can't

33:33.080 --> 33:40.280
possibly have any effects on our world they're not going to help us to solve problems as we would

33:40.280 --> 33:46.280
say we know they exist but beyond that what are they interesting in any way um well they're

33:46.280 --> 33:51.160
certainly interesting because mathematics is interesting and and uh where we are interested

33:51.160 --> 34:00.040
in abstractions as well as in physical problems um and the reason that that uh it seems implausible

34:00.040 --> 34:07.560
at the moment that that um undecidable propositions might be relevant to some practical problem like

34:07.560 --> 34:15.720
how to how to feed the world or how to eliminate viruses and and so on is that the undecidable

34:15.720 --> 34:23.320
propositions are all about infinite sets infinite sets of things like the set of all numbers and

34:23.320 --> 34:31.720
that kind of thing and uh physics as we currently conceive of it the the infinite sets that appear

34:31.720 --> 34:38.840
in physics are very tame and don't have these problems in them but that's that's like you know

34:38.840 --> 34:45.160
i can conceive that that maybe one day somebody invents a different physical theory where the

34:45.160 --> 34:52.600
the undecidability of certain propositions about the real numbers would tell you something about

34:52.600 --> 34:59.880
whether well about how to do and how not to do certain things that you want there i think roger

34:59.880 --> 35:07.480
penrose once pointed out that certain theories of quantum gravity do depend on turing undecidable

35:07.480 --> 35:15.560
propositions basically it's it's like you if you're working out a Feynman diagram to work out how

35:16.200 --> 35:21.480
what the probability is that a certain gravitational wave will interact with another gravitational

35:21.480 --> 35:26.760
wave you know this is very far from ordinary experience then if you want to work that out

35:26.760 --> 35:33.400
accurately you have to do a sum you have to sum the amplitudes for for all possible processes

35:33.400 --> 35:43.160
over all geometries and for all possible topologies and to enumerate all possible topologies in the

35:43.160 --> 35:48.600
relevant sense i mean i'm not a mathematician i don't know about this stuff but but apparently

35:48.600 --> 35:55.880
that's that's an undecidable task and therefore you couldn't work out this probability amplitude

35:55.880 --> 36:02.120
for the gravitational wave doing something or other because you would have to have a mathematical

36:02.120 --> 36:09.240
expression for all topologies in a in a given sense so that's an example of how in principle

36:09.240 --> 36:17.080
laws of physics might have undecidable consequences yes and therefore that the undecidable consequences

36:17.080 --> 36:23.480
are actually interesting well it would be physically interesting yes it you know in principle

36:23.480 --> 36:31.800
something that you wanted to do might depend on working out this thing but i don't see any

36:31.800 --> 36:37.640
particular reason for making a distance as long as we have the necessities of life and comfort

36:38.600 --> 36:45.880
i don't see any reason for making a distinction between problems in engineering and in physics

36:45.880 --> 36:51.400
and in pure mathematics i mean they're they're all problems they're all conflicts between theories

36:51.400 --> 36:57.160
that that interest people people want to know what the resolution is one thing i say in in the

36:57.160 --> 37:05.240
book about pure mathematical problems is that sometimes discovering that something is undecidable

37:05.800 --> 37:11.800
is the solution to the problem in in the sense that it's the it's what you wanted to know

37:12.440 --> 37:20.040
because you you have in mind some some prima facie argument that it that a certain proposition is

37:20.040 --> 37:27.080
true and another prima facie argument that it that it's false and then you discover that it's

37:27.080 --> 37:34.680
actually undecidable and that explains why you could have these two conflicting intuitions

37:34.680 --> 37:41.000
about it and then right you can go and criticize your intuitions in other ways because you know

37:41.000 --> 37:47.240
that you're not going to be able to resolve it by proving one of them true or false now you mentioned

37:47.240 --> 37:52.760
in that answer there the concept of abstractions and you actually invoked abstractions in in talking

37:52.760 --> 37:57.320
about it of course pure mathematics is about abstractions and i don't know what might be the

37:57.320 --> 38:03.320
most controversial chapter in the book but i think among intellectual types to at least some extent

38:03.320 --> 38:08.840
it would be chapter five if it's not going to be the white flowers a beautiful chapter it's going to

38:08.840 --> 38:15.880
be the one that claims there is a reality to abstractions because to some people this seems

38:15.880 --> 38:21.320
weirdly enough you know not to me i think not to most people listening to this but it can sound

38:21.320 --> 38:28.200
like an appeal to the supernatural or some sort of woo because some people are physicalists they

38:28.200 --> 38:33.960
think that everything just has to come down to the behavior of atoms but i wanted to ask you if

38:33.960 --> 38:39.400
you distinguish between kinds of abstractions rather than defending the thesis that abstractions are

38:39.400 --> 38:45.000
real i know this is not necessarily a well-defined area but for example something like numbers

38:45.000 --> 38:52.120
they're abstractions are they different in kind to let's say knowledge because after all there may

38:52.120 --> 38:57.000
be infinitely well there are infinitely many prime numbers and not all of those prime numbers ever

38:57.000 --> 39:02.520
need to be instantiated in a physical substrate anywhere nevertheless they still exist but knowledge

39:02.520 --> 39:09.560
to be knowledge has to be extantiae instantiated in a physical substrate it's also abstract but

39:10.200 --> 39:15.720
well i might pull the brakes there can you explain if there are these different species of

39:15.720 --> 39:23.880
abstractions and if so how do we understand the differences in their existence yes there are

39:23.880 --> 39:30.680
different species of abstractions i mean maybe it's better to say there there is a classification

39:30.680 --> 39:38.680
of abstractions and some classifications are quite useful because abstractions within the same

39:38.760 --> 39:43.160
category of classification have similar properties and can be understood with

39:43.160 --> 39:47.720
similar explanations or the same explanation but then with the different problem situations you

39:47.720 --> 39:53.320
might want to classify things differently like you know just like in biology we may wish to

39:54.440 --> 40:00.600
sometimes we want to classify things as mammals and birds and reptiles and so on and on other

40:00.600 --> 40:08.200
occasions we may want to classify them as aquatic creatures and terrestrial creatures and aerial

40:08.200 --> 40:15.240
creatures and so on so classifications are useful relative to the problems that they are

40:15.240 --> 40:21.400
that you want to talk about and it's the same with abstractions it's definitely true that

40:21.400 --> 40:27.960
some abstractions as you say like knowledge and information more generally don't exist unless

40:27.960 --> 40:34.920
they're instantiated so they have to have this extra element of being instantiated but that's

40:34.920 --> 40:41.480
also true of there are there are more classifications than that even even among pure abstractions

40:41.480 --> 40:48.680
there there are abstractions that it seems to be important in mathematics to like i said to

40:49.400 --> 40:55.880
distinguish between abstractions that involve infinite sets and abstractions that don't and then

40:56.600 --> 41:03.640
the whole idea of a set is is not universally applicable so the set of all sets it famously

41:03.720 --> 41:09.640
turned out even before girdle it turned out that this from russell that it turned out that the

41:10.280 --> 41:17.160
set of all sets isn't a set um so you then you have to invoke a class it's it's just a class of

41:17.160 --> 41:23.160
things or the set of all sets that don't contain itself so there's that's right so there's but

41:23.160 --> 41:27.880
it doesn't help because there's it doesn't help with everything because there's no such thing as

41:27.880 --> 41:34.680
the class of all classes either right so uh yes there there are different kinds of things and

41:34.680 --> 41:40.600
another thing which which i think is still slightly mysterious is what kind of an abstraction the laws

41:40.600 --> 41:46.920
of physics are some people think precisely by arguments such as such as you've mentioned that

41:47.480 --> 41:53.960
there really are no laws of physics all there are are physical events and physical processes

41:53.960 --> 41:59.880
and laws are just a kind of way of summarizing physical events and processes they just are

41:59.880 --> 42:06.520
so because i see that that looking out of the window i can see that the sky is cloudless at the

42:06.520 --> 42:15.400
moment that is some kind of emergent consequence of the laws of physics but it if it's true then

42:17.240 --> 42:22.120
people who deny that there are laws of physics will say well that's just a fact about the universe

42:22.120 --> 42:28.200
and you could you could summarize it and say that on three of the four days of this week the sky was

42:28.200 --> 42:35.320
clear and that's not a law of nature so why should we why why should there be anything special

42:35.960 --> 42:43.640
about the statement that nothing can exceed the speed of light well it's because the statement

42:43.640 --> 42:50.280
that nothing exceeds the speed of light is not just a prediction it is an explanation it's an

42:50.280 --> 42:57.560
explanation of how the universe is that the universe is a four-dimensional pseudo-rimanian

42:57.560 --> 43:05.240
manifold with a metric and and and so on and so on and the fact that the speed of light is finite

43:06.040 --> 43:15.960
emerges from that explanation and you could write down all the predictions that follow from that

43:16.760 --> 43:23.000
uh in a sort of infinitely long list of things like like this dog can't run faster than light and

43:23.000 --> 43:28.360
this car can't travel faster than light and what once you've made that uh infinitely long list or

43:28.360 --> 43:34.600
maybe just very long very very long list you would have written down everything that can be deduced

43:34.600 --> 43:43.560
about what happens in nature but you wouldn't have ever listed that law and you wouldn't have

43:43.560 --> 43:50.440
ever mentioned manifolds and four-dimensional or anything like that well you'd have some

43:50.440 --> 43:55.480
significant explaining to do wouldn't you uh it well if you wanted explanations you'd have a

43:55.480 --> 44:00.920
lot of explaining to do you would in fact have all the explaining to do at the end of that huge

44:00.920 --> 44:07.240
process that you had at the beginning you wouldn't have explained anything we were we were just talking

44:07.240 --> 44:14.760
about how um the nature of physical laws and whether or not and to what extent they might be

44:15.400 --> 44:20.760
pure abstractions or a kind of abstraction of some kind and I was just thinking to myself that

44:20.760 --> 44:27.880
for anyone who denies the existence of physical laws in their own right laws of physics and to

44:27.880 --> 44:34.360
just say well there are just facts of matter about the universe for example the orbits of

44:34.840 --> 44:41.160
planets going around stars are approximately circular or elliptical then those facts of the

44:41.160 --> 44:47.320
matter those regularities in nature seem to be crying out for an explanation so to deny that

44:47.320 --> 44:53.240
there would be really existing physical laws behind those regularities in nature seems to me to be

44:53.240 --> 44:58.360
going to a lot of work to avoid what might otherwise be called Occam's razor well isn't

44:58.360 --> 45:03.960
the simple explanation there are physical laws out there governing these things yes uh of course

45:03.960 --> 45:11.880
if somebody insists on the non-existence of explanations like exactly like insistence on

45:11.880 --> 45:22.280
the non-existence of anything you can't be proved wrong but I think the motivation for

45:22.280 --> 45:31.000
denying the existence of laws is the old mistake of empiricism it is the assumption

45:31.960 --> 45:42.520
that raw facts or raw sensory impressions have a privileged status in that in that we can access

45:42.520 --> 45:49.400
them directly and this is this people contrast this with things like laws and explanations in

45:49.400 --> 45:55.480
general which they say we can't access directly so so they are they have some kind of a lesser

45:55.560 --> 46:03.720
reality and we can in principle not insist on there being real one can insist on there not

46:03.720 --> 46:08.040
being real and it doesn't make any difference but the trouble with that is that exactly the

46:08.040 --> 46:15.880
same is true of sense impressions as well and so this argument that abstractions don't really

46:15.880 --> 46:23.080
exist or that laws don't really exist and so on are hidden in there is the assumption that

46:23.080 --> 46:30.040
sense impressions or that kind of thing do really exist in some sense of really which is itself a

46:30.040 --> 46:37.880
mistake that all knowledge is conjectural all observations are theory laden there is nothing

46:37.880 --> 46:43.880
that is an authoritative source of knowledge everything is conjecture and so what once you've

46:43.880 --> 46:49.160
realized that everything is conjecture but that knowledge can still exist then the reason for

46:49.240 --> 46:55.240
making a distinction between different kinds of existence well no there is a distinction between

46:55.240 --> 47:02.040
different kinds of existence but the justification the motivation for denying that certain things

47:02.040 --> 47:11.640
exist even if we need them in our explanations goes away and this once one becomes at least

47:11.640 --> 47:17.640
somewhat familiar with the worldview that you've presented in your books and with poppers worldview

47:17.640 --> 47:25.640
it's it's very difficult to try and reimagine what people mean by directly observe i i struggle

47:25.640 --> 47:30.920
now to try and conceive of what one really means when they say well there are certain things you

47:30.920 --> 47:37.640
can just observe you can just see but on explaining to them well let's think about what that whole

47:37.640 --> 47:44.600
process of seeing actually consists of of photons you know being absorbed and then re-emitted back

47:44.600 --> 47:48.920
towards the eye and then being converted into electrical signals which then go into your brain

47:48.920 --> 47:57.240
this this whole concept of direct observation actually itself vanishes into a cloud of explanation

47:57.240 --> 48:04.040
not so much a cloud but a a kind of way of understanding the world that denies the possibility

48:04.040 --> 48:10.200
of direct observation i don't even know what someone really intends by this terminology this

48:10.200 --> 48:16.280
why of denying the reality of things which we don't have direct observe don't have direct

48:16.280 --> 48:23.240
access to when we don't have direct access to anything even i would tentatively argue that

48:23.240 --> 48:30.600
even the contents of our own minds i agree in a way the contents of our own minds are are quite a

48:30.600 --> 48:37.880
highly sophisticated kind of knowledge that we only know through an extensive chain of interpretations

48:37.880 --> 48:45.720
some of which are notoriously unreliable you know even in everyday language we we we know

48:45.720 --> 48:54.760
what we mean when we say you're just fooling yourself or the content of those ideas is incompatible

48:54.760 --> 49:01.880
with empiricism with the idea that knowledge reliable knowledge comes from the senses and

49:01.880 --> 49:07.640
i think people regard that as just one of those things you know it's it's it's one of the mysteries

49:07.640 --> 49:14.440
of nature it's it's the problem of induction or something like that and you say it's hard to imagine

49:15.160 --> 49:21.960
what people mean when they when they talk about direct observation it's interesting that that

49:21.960 --> 49:28.760
concept of direct observation also had to be invented at one time and in fact it was quite a

49:28.760 --> 49:35.640
liberation when it was first invented like in various stages there was there was empiricism

49:35.640 --> 49:43.720
in in the john lock sense is relatively recent but but the idea that we can gain knowledge

49:43.720 --> 49:51.000
by looking at the world which is false was these concepts of knowledge and looking and reliable

49:51.000 --> 49:57.240
and that kind of thing they're not built into our genes somebody invented those concepts and at

49:57.240 --> 50:03.000
the time when they invented them they were an improvement on on something that was more vague

50:03.000 --> 50:09.480
and more false than that trust the authority or something for example yes but there was a time

50:09.480 --> 50:15.800
when you didn't even have to say trust the authorities when uh trusting the authorities

50:15.800 --> 50:21.080
was just the way that the world was and nobody bothered to put that into words that reminds

50:21.080 --> 50:28.840
me of the divine right of kings which is a concept that was invented only after the authority of kings

50:28.840 --> 50:36.520
was questioned yes well this all raises the fact that there is this creativity going on this creation

50:36.520 --> 50:44.200
of concepts in order to try and come to better understand the world that is the uniquely creative

50:44.200 --> 50:50.920
capacity of the human mind and mind itself how do you understand the nature of mind i sometimes

50:50.920 --> 50:56.360
think of it as this abstraction i think you've said this to me it's a it's a it's a it's a funny

50:56.360 --> 51:02.520
kind of abstraction it's an abstraction that itself needs to be instantiated in matter but also

51:02.520 --> 51:07.960
needs to be running it can't just be like any other piece of knowledge which you can transmit

51:07.960 --> 51:13.000
from one place to another in different physical forms and that's one way of understanding what

51:13.000 --> 51:18.120
knowledge is it allows itself to continue to persist over time and to get itself copied to get

51:18.120 --> 51:25.000
itself replicated but our mind a human mind this thing that is enabling the creation of this knowledge

51:25.000 --> 51:32.440
it itself it is an unusual kind of abstraction how do you think of it at the moment yes so it's

51:32.440 --> 51:39.400
an unusual kind of knowledge so we have yet another classification uh a mind is a kind of a

51:39.400 --> 51:45.240
kind of knowledge you might say but it's a kind of knowledge that doesn't only have to be instantiated

51:45.240 --> 51:52.840
but as you have just said it has to be running now what does that mean running how fast running in

51:52.840 --> 52:01.640
what because uh running in the wrong kind of computer would make it gibberish or in a kind of

52:01.640 --> 52:07.400
computer that has the wrong mapping to to reality we don't know how it works we don't know how the

52:07.400 --> 52:13.160
mind so the mind is characterized by creativity i think we can go that far at least the human

52:13.160 --> 52:18.840
mind is characterized by creativity but we don't know what creativity is we don't know what

52:18.840 --> 52:24.920
the distinction is between a computer program that is running creatively and one that is not

52:24.920 --> 52:31.800
running creatively uh one day we will know but we don't know yet i i think also there are and again

52:31.800 --> 52:38.200
minds that minds exist is common sense even though we don't know how they work or what specifically

52:38.200 --> 52:47.400
they are so more recent ideas that maybe minds don't exist that had to be invented too uh it is

52:47.400 --> 52:53.080
not at all common sense and it doesn't at all follow from any good philosophy but we don't know

52:53.960 --> 53:01.240
and uh one of the things i think that that is a misconception that dates from a very long time

53:01.240 --> 53:09.720
ago is is that a mind is like mostly consistent that it consists of uh the ideas in the mind

53:10.440 --> 53:17.400
are mostly consistent and when they're inconsistent that's a kind of emergency and and we have to

53:17.400 --> 53:22.840
fix that because we have because that does that that means that it's not a proper mind really

53:23.560 --> 53:30.280
um it's it's uh contains inconsistencies rather and therefore that's no different from

53:31.000 --> 53:38.280
uh a load of propositions written down on a piece of paper i don't think that's true at all i i i think

53:38.920 --> 53:46.040
a better way to think of the mind is as a set of problems and a problem consists of conflicting

53:46.040 --> 53:53.560
theories so uh or rather a problem is is more like some conflicting theories that we have noticed

53:53.560 --> 53:59.080
because we don't really think of something as a problem unless it's giving rise to some thought

53:59.080 --> 54:05.320
so uh but but there must be ideas that are conflicting with each other before we have noticed

54:05.320 --> 54:13.080
it and so the mind i i think of it as sort of massive tangled ideas which are largely inconsistent

54:13.160 --> 54:20.120
the parts of it which we have sorted out into a kind of consistency are a minority

54:21.320 --> 54:27.160
that are currently not uh giving rise to any thought they might be invoked in some

54:27.960 --> 54:34.360
thought that's about some other inconsistency but the part of the mind that is thinking is

54:34.360 --> 54:41.880
full of inconsistency and so therefore a model of the mind that thinks of the mind as a set of

54:41.880 --> 54:51.000
consistent propositions with occasional inconsistencies that we then fix it is uh i i i think very far

54:51.000 --> 54:59.240
from the truth it's it's not a set of consistent ideas and it's not a set of propositions because

54:59.240 --> 55:06.120
propositions have a definite truth value they each proposition is either true or false and it has a

55:06.120 --> 55:13.160
perfectly definite meaning if it has a meaning uh whereas the ideas in minds don't have a definite

55:13.160 --> 55:20.600
meaning and they're not precisely true or false we can make them have as sharp a meaning as our

55:20.600 --> 55:26.920
current problem situation requires that's what we should be aiming for and we can make them as

55:26.920 --> 55:34.600
consistent as the current problem situation requires and we're striving you talked earlier about

55:34.600 --> 55:41.160
about uh truth we're striving to make them as true as the current problem situation requires

55:41.160 --> 55:48.520
yes so it sounds that whatever the nature of the mind is in a computational sense has to be

55:49.160 --> 55:56.840
radically different to any other kind of program that we've hitherto encountered because all those

55:56.840 --> 56:03.160
other programs are written in such a way that it's proposition after proposition perhaps one

56:03.160 --> 56:09.640
following from another it's an algorithm of a kind and these statements need to be consistent

56:09.640 --> 56:14.840
or the computer program itself isn't going to run but you're saying that it's possibly the case that

56:15.560 --> 56:21.160
underlying this uniquely creative capacity of the human mind is something that is quite the

56:21.160 --> 56:27.400
mirror image of that in in at least some respects and maybe this is this is what is needed in order

56:27.400 --> 56:33.960
to uh go some way to explaining what's going on here with um uh creativity or another way

56:34.760 --> 56:41.000
that you've put that in the beginning infinity is of course um explanatory universality this idea

56:41.000 --> 56:49.880
that even if there were other kinds of creativity prior to us what we have is a kind of creativity

56:49.880 --> 56:56.840
which allows us to create knowledge which is going to be able to solve problems in principle

56:56.840 --> 57:01.480
about anything that exists in the physical universe which brings me to one of my little

57:01.480 --> 57:08.280
hobby horses which is this uh concept that people sometimes raise that well there might be snalions

57:08.280 --> 57:13.800
out there the super advanced aliens who are going to have uh some successor to the successor to the

57:13.800 --> 57:18.600
successor of the unification of quantum theory in general relativity and even if they could bring it

57:18.600 --> 57:24.280
to us we wouldn't understand it it would be written in a mathematics that's too complicated

57:24.280 --> 57:31.080
for us or consists of concepts that are beyond our puny human minds to understand either that or

57:31.080 --> 57:35.640
you know the super intelligence is going to come along at some point in the future and it too is

57:35.640 --> 57:41.000
going to recognize that it's so much smarter than us and we probably all deserve to be exterminated

57:41.000 --> 57:48.280
something like that um what's wrong with these I think quite commonly held views about other

57:48.280 --> 57:53.560
kinds of minds super advanced alien minds or super intelligent artificial intelligences

57:53.560 --> 57:59.880
again of course we can't prove that such things don't exist uh there's there's a very famous one

57:59.880 --> 58:08.280
called god which there have been disputes about um uh for many centuries they have

58:11.640 --> 58:18.120
yes I I mean uh even the bible speaks of unbelievers so they they must have existed at

58:18.120 --> 58:27.400
right yes um and to be a believer in that kind of entity means that you're you're believing in an

58:27.400 --> 58:36.200
entity whose mind whose mental processes are first of all not embedded in physics not instantiated

58:36.200 --> 58:42.840
in physics in in the same way that ours are and also that they can reach further they can understand

58:42.840 --> 58:49.400
things that things embedded in mere physics can never understand and you can't prove that's false

58:50.120 --> 58:58.200
but it is a bad explanation as I as I point out in the beginning of infinity and so one thing is that

58:58.200 --> 59:03.720
that there are many such theories and there are there are many theories about such entities

59:04.440 --> 59:12.520
whether they be snalians or gods or devils or demons or artificial general intelligences

59:13.000 --> 59:19.560
those theories since they're bad explanations they have the property that uh if two people

59:19.560 --> 59:26.920
such believers in different ones come to persuade me of their view then there's nothing I can do

59:26.920 --> 59:33.400
to choose between them it's it's uh like they are invoking some non-understandable thing

59:33.400 --> 59:39.480
and the two of them are invoking some two non-understandable things with a non-understandable

59:39.480 --> 59:45.320
difference between them so uh I would like to you know put both those people into a sack

59:45.960 --> 59:51.800
and tie it shut and then only have to debate with the survivor just for efficiency

59:53.400 --> 01:00:00.200
very good so that that that's related to this idea that again problems are soluble and what I

01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:06.200
would suggest is that a kind of a special case of that almost is that the all evils are due to

01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:10.920
lack of knowledge principle of optimism that you have but here it's really interesting the

01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:17.000
principle of optimism this claim that all evils are due to a lack of knowledge seems to be linking

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:24.200
quite strongly epistemology stuff about knowledge to evil stuff about morality isn't that a big

01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:30.760
leap surely people who do evil things are doing evil things because of their ideas which is to say

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:36.360
what they know it's not a lack of knowledge is it it's it's a it is the presence of some knowledge

01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:43.240
oh well that's the same thing uh they they they are doing it because their knowledge is inadequate

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:51.880
is false in in some relevant way and even the the good guys their knowledge is better than the

01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:58.200
bad guys but it's still not true it's not perfect it can be improved the good in fact the good guys

01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:04.360
are characterized to a large extent by the fact that they are open to correcting their existing

01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:11.400
knowledge and to adopting better ideas that they previously didn't know yes I think it it's the

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:18.840
it's the natural thing it should be one's first guess that moral knowledge is included in in the

01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:26.200
same epistemology as physical or mathematical knowledge because as I've said the arguments

01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:31.080
that there are different kinds of knowledge depending on some kind of privilege access to

01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:37.400
one or the other is just a mistake it's it's uh you know empiricism or something of the kind

01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:46.520
that that is is just a not understanding the conjectural nature of all ideas yes and that

01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:53.000
include must include moral ones and mathematical ones and physical ones and and so on and the

01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:58.520
uniformly the way to get better ideas is to try to get better explanations in the light of the

01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:04.200
problems that one has with those ideas there might be I think there's even another way that

01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:12.200
the beginning of infinity does create a strong link in one's mind between epistemology and

01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:17.560
morality and that would be in the moral injunction do not destroy the means of error correction so

01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:23.160
there we have you know error correction that's epistemology and do not do this thing okay so

01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:29.960
there's a moral claim now I wanted to focus on this for a minute because this might raise an issue

01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:35.640
within constructor theory and that this is your new physics along with your new theory of physics

01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:40.840
along with Chiara Marletto about the physics of the possible and the impossible or the possible

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:46.440
and impossible transformations I think is one way it might be described and among many things to be

01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:52.040
excited about with this approach is the link it seems to me between physics and epistemology and

01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:58.040
we already know some of this story we we know that what can be proven in mathematics depends

01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:01.880
on what we know about what the laws of physics are and how the laws of physics operate and

01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:06.040
because we know that proofs in mathematics are a kind of computation computation requires a

01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:09.800
computer the computer has to be made out of something they made out of matter the matter

01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:14.760
obeys laws of physics so we can only prove things that the laws of physics say it is possible to

01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:20.600
prove but constructor theory seems to be generalizing this further I'm not sure if that'd be fair to say

01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:26.040
so we're going beyond mathematics now and perhaps into realms where we are saying look some things

01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:30.840
are not possible to know and some things are possible to know even outside of mathematics but

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:35.800
there may be things impossible to know in history for example or in science because there'll be no

01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:41.720
transformation allowing us to actually construct the knowledge that solves the problem there but

01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:47.080
this if I've just gone way off the rails in my reasoning here would seem to contradict the

01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:53.560
problems a soluble claim in the beginning infinity though the one example I want to call on I think

01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:57.560
you might have mentioned this in the fabric of reality I can't remember but it's something to

01:03:57.560 --> 01:04:04.360
the effect of let's say you wanted to know what Augustus Caesar 8 on his 13th birthday that's a

01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:10.360
reasonable scientific question but it might also be unknowable but it's not going to be a problem

01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:15.000
for our understanding because it's going to be inherently uninteresting it's not going to solve

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:21.880
any actual historical problems but is this way of thinking about how constructor theory comes to

01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:31.480
bear on morality and epistemology at all valid I think that one can address that issue without

01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:37.560
using constructor theory directly if constructor theory works then there will be a theory of

01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:42.040
knowledge within constructor theory just like there'll be a theory of quantum mechanics within

01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:49.080
constructor theory we don't know how these subsidiary theories whether these subsidiary

01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:54.280
theories will be changed or if they have to be changed to what extent they have to be our theory

01:04:54.280 --> 01:05:01.800
of knowledge is nowhere near as as precise and accurate as theories about physics I don't quite

01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:10.040
understand your question because suppose we had a problem about Caesar's what Caesar 8 on his 13th

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:16.680
birthday I think the example I usually use is Julius Caesar's last meal ah yes yes never mind I mean

01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:25.160
Augustus Caesar's 13th birthday meal is just as good um if some problem depended on knowing that

01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:35.640
as a as a solution then it's not accurate to cast this this problem in terms of having to have

01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:42.200
evidence of what it was you know this is this is not necessarily a question of which observables

01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:49.000
can be observed in physics we know that most of the observables the detailed observables

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:55.560
of the past are have been randomized to such an extent that it would require an infeasible

01:05:55.560 --> 01:06:03.000
amount of collection of knowledge an infeasible amount of measurement shall we say to to reconstitute

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:10.360
it and that might well be true I mean if it isn't true of of these Caesar meal events it'll be true

01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:19.080
of some lots of events it'll be true of most events at the time so assume that that it is

01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:25.480
infeasible because of the laws of physics and this could be expressed precisely in constructive theory

01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:32.040
to measure Julius Caesar's last meal that doesn't mean that we can't solve the problem that gave rise

01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:37.960
to this question because it can't be a question about physics from from the point of view of

01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:44.040
physics this is a very uninteresting question so it would be a thing it would be a question about

01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:49.800
history or about sociology yes or about you know some subject that hasn't been invented yet in which

01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:56.840
there would be explanations that rival explanations both of which had reasonable arguments in their

01:06:56.840 --> 01:07:02.360
favor and which somebody decided could be resolved by making this measurement and then it turns out

01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:06.760
this measurement is impossible well that doesn't mean that it can't be resolved in other ways

01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:13.960
yes I mean we we know that that last meal was not a cheeseburger

01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:23.000
and that is not because we have measurements to that effect it's because we have high level theories

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:30.840
about the development of human culture and the problem about what he ate etc would have come

01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:39.080
out of that kind of field yes precisely if we may well come out of that kind of field as well

01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:46.440
yeah I can only imagine that the question would arise if there was a problem about how and why

01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:51.880
he died so if it was Julius Caesar and there was some concern that maybe he'd been poisoned

01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:58.600
just before he died well then there would presumably be theories about you know existing

01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:03.800
historical documents about how various other people living with him at the time didn't particularly

01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:08.200
like him and then presumably although we might not be able to tell what his final meal was

01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:13.560
some very smart forensic scientist might be able to detect some kind of toxin in

01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:19.240
where his stomach used to be so I imagine that even a problem like this it wouldn't be framed and

01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:25.640
exactly those words what was his last meal but it might be you know some some some other kind of

01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:30.520
historical question exactly it would arise out of some problem that wasn't a physics problem for

01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:37.080
sure yes but by the way there is this problem with Napoleon you know did did he die of wallpaper

01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:45.240
right because you know it's it's controversial how Napoleon died he wasn't that old

01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:54.360
and he had some symptoms which are consistent with arsenic poisoning and there were people

01:08:54.440 --> 01:09:00.040
who who would would have preferred to see him dead and then other people have said well yes it was

01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:07.000
arsenic poisoning but it was because of the wallpaper the the color of the wallpaper was

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:13.880
was caused by arsenic paint and other people who said yes so there was arsenic in the wallpaper

01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:19.720
but not enough to kill him and so on and so on and this problem is eminently addressable

01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:27.560
not by going and finding video evidence of the poisoner okay so the following popper and like

01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:32.520
myself and I was in that tradition we don't place any real currency on the source of an idea

01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:36.200
because any idea can be evaluated utterly independent of its source or its author

01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:41.240
and I can take all that on board I think you go even further in this that you're not even interested

01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:46.680
much in the origin of ideas or the history of ideas and this is actually encapsulated in what

01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:51.800
Naval has been at pains to point out in his podcast with me anyway but he's not much interested

01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:56.280
in names who said what and so on it's basically about the ideas and I think that's quite right

01:09:56.280 --> 01:10:00.840
nevertheless personally and I guess there's a point of indulgence for than anything else

01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:05.400
I am interested in the history of ideas to some extent so you know I like to know the fact that

01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:09.800
Einstein really was the prime originator of general relativity but it's interesting to know

01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:15.240
that Marcel Grausman for example helped him and you know I think one or more of his wives might

01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:19.800
have helped him as well with the mathematics on general relativity um so it's it's interesting

01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:26.680
historically about how these great theories kind of came to us what the lineage is now that brings

01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:32.680
me to this question about quantum computation I'm interested in this because you were inspired

01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:40.920
obviously by Turing and your paper as of I think it was last week anyway it's now been cited 6122

01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:46.680
times which is no small feat that that paper being titled quantum theory the church Turing

01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:52.600
principle in the universal quantum computer what I wanted to ask you about that is as you wrote it

01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:57.160
because I think when Turing wrote his paper on the Turing machine he was thinking well it's an

01:10:57.160 --> 01:11:02.920
abstract mathematical object this isn't going to have much I don't know did did he think it was

01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:09.480
going to have much in the way of a huge industry of engineering these things was going to follow I

01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:14.360
don't know if that was in his mind but did you have any sense in writing the paper about quantum

01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:20.760
computation that it would have spawned an industry a multi-billion dollar at the moment industry of

01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:31.160
racing to build these things did that enter your mind at the time no I was entirely concerned with

01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:40.840
the laws of physics and that this was a hitherto unsuspected facet of quantum theory that it had

01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:49.640
this intimate relationship with computation so I had in the back of my mind that maybe this could

01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:55.800
be built a quantum computer could be built for the purpose of demonstrating or testing

01:11:56.280 --> 01:12:01.000
properties of the laws of physics of quantum theory but I wasn't concerned with

01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:09.240
with practical uses of it at all and not even other laboratory uses of it and by the way

01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:16.200
I think I'm not a so I'm not a historian of science I don't know much about the history of ideas in

01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:25.560
general yes only certain very narrow facets but I think that history in general is an extremely

01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:31.640
important worthwhile subject and the history of ideas in particular is I think the most

01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:39.560
important aspect of history it's just that I happen you know to to have studied other things

01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:47.560
mostly but I think that Turing was also not interested at the time when he wrote that paper

01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:57.240
in making anything useful Babbage interestingly was yes and the for him

01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:05.720
the again I'm going by TV documentaries rather than any real research of my own

01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:13.720
but it seems that that he was initially concerned with a very practical application of computers

01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:20.200
namely the autumn automation of the printing of mathematical tables which had to do with

01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:28.760
navigation and and so on and that he he even when he conceived of the universal version of

01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:35.320
this machine which was then called the analytical engine he still wasn't then what he saw was this

01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:41.800
this was a universal machine for arithmetic and for algebra but or not even for algebra I'm not

01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:49.720
sure for arithmetic at least and it was Lovelace who saw that that this machine would be universal

01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:57.080
in the sense that we mean today yes yes and so that then that leads me to the question that

01:13:57.080 --> 01:14:02.280
I don't want it to be too uncomfortable but there is this question about was it church was it

01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:07.160
Turing and now of course you bring in Babbage as well and Lovelace she says was the first to figure

01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:13.640
out that these machines could be universal well to what extent do you think Feynman understood

01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:21.000
the universality of a quantum computation did he have a conception of it at all around the

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:27.160
time when you were writing this paper or was it only in light of you telling him about the proof

01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:34.520
that he then sort of got what you were going on about I don't know I only met him once and we

01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:43.480
had a long conversation only part of which was about quantum computation and and I was not at all

01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:52.600
focused on finding out what he knows right okay yes so I don't know but I know that in in his

01:14:52.600 --> 01:15:00.680
published work there is no real hint of the thing that is now called a universal quantum computer

01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:06.280
or actually it's now more often called the universal quantum Turing machine which is a very

01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:15.080
bad bad terminology but there's although he again he was aware that quantum computation

01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:21.800
could be more powerful than classical computation and he was aware of a certain level of universality

01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:32.040
but his idea for how to how to make one of these was itself to put on some kind of circuit board

01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:40.440
a quantum system that had specially tuned Hamiltonians whereas in the real quantum computer

01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:47.960
the special tuning is itself a quantum program it's there is a single machine you don't have to

01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:56.600
change the hardware to make to make to to compute a new quantum computation there is a single machine

01:15:56.600 --> 01:16:03.080
that can be programmed to enact any quantum computation and I I don't think in I don't

01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:09.400
think there's any hint of that in Feynman's published work although the speed with which

01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:17.000
he cottoned on to the algorithm that I explained to him suggests that he was on the verge of that

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:25.160
either before I spoke to him or just after okay two final just purely for fun questions

01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:33.240
as you said who cares this is this is true this is true except for historians of science I'm sure

01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:39.080
in the in the years and decades to come this will be a certainly a point of interest maybe in

01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:47.080
future they'll analyze the wallpaper and find out yes okay this question is just purely for fun

01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:52.040
um do you have any opinion on tic-tacs that's a big thing going on at the moment and do you

01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:59.320
know what I'm talking about no I don't know what it is oh okay so this is the the American military

01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:06.760
specifically I think the navy who've released these videos of what they say are unidentified

01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:12.280
objects of some kind and I know this is ridiculous they say things like they're

01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:18.760
violating laws of physics or at least they are evidence of technology which is not

01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:25.400
explicable given the current state of technology you haven't heard about these things seen anything

01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:29.560
about these things nor have any opinion on these things well now that you mention it I I've seen

01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:37.320
things on twitter right which are now explicable in the light of is it the the American military

01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:46.680
or something having having said something about UFOs yes I see okay well the opportunities for

01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:58.200
error are enormous and to perform a scientific experiment that is is a crucial test of sophisticated

01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:06.200
scientific theories is very very difficult and and universally almost universally underestimated

01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:12.120
it's sort of taken for granted that that einstein did a very difficult thing but it's not so much

01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:18.200
understood the stern and gullach who who uh did experiments on quantum superpositions of

01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:25.160
particles in different positions but they did an amazing thing as well yes good experiments are

01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:34.440
rare and they require usually a great deal of skill and creativity and it's not the kind of thing

01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:48.440
that military pilots or policemen are typically cognizant of yes so I think when people like that

01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:56.680
report a thing that quote violates the laws of physics I would consider it unreasonable

01:18:57.320 --> 01:19:03.880
to go for any explanation of that other than human error yes yes and of course when you do

01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:09.400
look at the the footage there is no apparent violation laws of physics even if you grant

01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:14.760
that this thing is moving at a high velocity beyond anything that we might be capable of that's still

01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:21.160
sub light speed so it hasn't violated relativity on the one hand and by the way even if you

01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:25.960
don't have an answer for what's going on there well that's kind of where you might have to

01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:31.560
stop you don't immediately leap to its uh aliens from the other side of the galaxy um my last question

01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:38.360
is from my father and I I'll just ask you this before I go it's about dark energy and uh we know

01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:45.320
the universe is accelerating in its expansion it's behaving as if there is negative pressure

01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:51.400
on the outside of the observable universe isn't this evidence that the observable universe is

01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:59.960
actually inside of a much larger region itself of lower density but magnificently greater size

01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:04.760
perhaps infinite in size and perhaps it's actually got zero density perhaps this void beyond our

01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:09.800
universe is the thing into which the universe is necessarily expanding because we've got positive

01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:13.720
pressure inside of our universe and outside of that outside of our universe that's negative

01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:19.960
pressure could this be a solution so first of all dark energy is just the name given to this

01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:25.720
anomalous expansion in which we haven't explained yes so I think the reason that dark energy was

01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:34.280
chosen as a name is because of dark matter where the all reasonable theories of it so far have

01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:39.480
postulated that it's a kind of matter and it's dark because because it doesn't interact with

01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:45.480
with photons and so on with dark energy we don't have such a thing we we don't know that there

01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:51.080
is a source of pressure or that these observations are caused by something pushing on the universe

01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:59.000
and so on but with the prevailing theories of what dark energy does never mind what it is but

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:08.200
what it does the universe is not expanding into anything the universe is is the length scales in

01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:17.000
the universe are increasing intrinsically and this is the same the same as was the case with the

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:24.440
with the prevailing theories before dark energy that the universe initially had well at any rate

01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:30.120
very near to the big bang it was very small there was a time when it was only the size of an atom

01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:35.880
there was a time when it was only the size of a neutron and so on and at that time and now it's

01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:42.520
much bigger the difference between then and now is not that it has expanded to fill a void it has

01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:50.200
just expanded intrinsically yes and some of the present theories say that it is in fact infinitely

01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:57.560
large and that it is infinite infinitely large and homogeneous so that the the total amount of

01:21:57.560 --> 01:22:04.680
matter in it is infinite i don't think that there are any theories i mean one could easily write

01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:11.720
down a theory in which the universe was inhomogeneous and we are in the only place in it that has

01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:17.400
matter right yes that wouldn't help in any way with any of the existing theories and more generally

01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:25.480
by the way theories of inhomogeneity in the universe as far as i know i'm not an expert on this but i

01:22:25.480 --> 01:22:30.760
think they've only been invoked by people who want to say that there is no dark energy that it's just

01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:37.800
a coincidence caused by inhomogeneities excellent okay i think that absolutely answered the question

01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:41.880
i think that will do for now but i hope not for the last time i make my way through the fabric

01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:47.000
of reality after all now at the moment so perhaps at the end of that we can speak again if not

01:22:47.800 --> 01:22:54.920
sooner so thank you very much for writing the books i think they've been well the explanations

01:22:54.920 --> 01:22:59.560
that transform the world i think they've been life transforming for many people so it's been

01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:05.160
wonderful to talk to you very gratifying today to have this conversation so have a wonderful

01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:09.320
remainder of the day yourself same to you it's always fun chatting

01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:20.200
so there we go i hope you enjoyed that i certainly did as i say i'm working on what might be called

01:23:20.200 --> 01:23:26.040
interview technique it's a steep learning curve the content of deutch and poppers oevoir is deep

01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:31.800
and subtle enough but adding to that how to run a podcast and being surrounded by new upgraded

01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:37.640
podcast hardware and software that i'm struggling to learn to use is a whole other thing but hopefully

01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:42.280
will improve rapidly over the coming weeks and months if you're a new listener i'd encourage

01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:47.160
you to go out and to listen to all of the david deutch content that is out there here's ted

01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:52.200
talks and other interviews of course buy his books subscribe to my podcast here wherever

01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:56.920
you're listening there is a youtube version as i say if you are on audio only which sometimes

01:23:56.920 --> 01:24:02.840
has those pretty visuals subscribe to the neval podcast where we are exploring all the major

01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:09.560
themes in the fabric of reality and the beginning of infinity and neval is broadening all that content

01:24:09.560 --> 01:24:18.760
out into the realms of wealth wisdom and life and finally if you're so inclined go to www.bretthall.org

01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:23.240
and follow the links there to support this podcast there are lots of great podcasts out there all

01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:29.960
about science and philosophy and even thinking but i think here we have a small community uniquely

01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:37.080
devoted to a particularly special kind of clear thinking about life informed by the best that

01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:42.520
science and philosophy can teach us we'd like to grow so the ideas can reach into places where the

01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:48.120
errors need correcting so i'll keep doing my bit until next time let me steal a line from neval

01:24:48.120 --> 01:25:01.800
and say stay optimistic bye

01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:29.800
