0	27080	Welcome to Topcast and to the long-awaited, or at least often mentioned, Episode 100.
27080	32000	This here is finally my interview with David in full, unabridged form.
32000	35920	It contains all my questions for David and multiple more questions.
35920	39800	This is basically an audio-only podcast, there are no visuals today.
39800	43960	My friend recently told me that he doesn't like it when I say to audio-only listeners
43960	48480	that the YouTube version is sometimes better because I put lots of pretty visuals in it.
48480	52800	He says that he listens while he's out walking or jogging and can't look at a screen.
52800	55720	Well today, Adam, you don't need to worry about that.
55720	59920	And to all the other Adams out there who I think outnumber the YouTube viewers by about
59920	66560	a 10 to 1 ratio, I'll keep in mind, moving forward as we say, that so many of you only
66560	69560	listen and don't watch screens.
69560	75440	Perhaps it would be more fair if it was a 10 to 1 ratio of audio-only to visually important
75440	77600	podcast from now on, we'll see.
77600	83480	So this episode is, I have to say up front, rather an astonishing personal accomplishment
83480	84640	for me.
84640	86840	Everyone has people they admire growing up.
86840	91440	Among my peer group, like any group of school kids I guess, the common thing was looking
91440	95160	up to famous sports stars or music idols or movie stars.
95160	97960	I know I idolized Arnold Schwarzenegger.
97960	102160	This was back in his early days of doing movies, not his more recent political stuff.
102160	107560	Back then he was quite the optimist and his personal story was easily as heroic as any
107720	109800	of his on-screen characters.
109800	112240	Nevertheless, I was never under any illusions.
112240	116240	I'd ever get to meet Arnold, much less have a conversation with him.
116240	119240	I lived in Australia in the southwestern suburbs of Sydney.
119240	123880	It's not the place to come across movie stars, sports celebrities, singers or accomplished
123880	126120	scientists for the most part.
126120	132000	But happily for me, some intellectual heroes of mine were accessible by pure chance and
132000	133760	circumstance in some cases.
133760	138000	I've mentioned before on this podcast that Professor Paul Davies, author of The Mind
138000	144000	of God and many other books, produced a couple of physics documentary series here in Australia
144000	145760	called The Big Questions.
145760	150840	He also used to write articles for local news outlets and he appeared on TV here rather regularly
150840	153400	when he did live here in Australia for a time.
153400	158160	I read, listened to and watched anything and everything Professor Davies ever put out there
158160	164000	that I could find and early on he was the guy, my scientific hero so to speak.
164000	168400	He seemed to know everything for some reason, so it was an amazing stroke of luck when one
168400	171320	day he just happened to turn up, unannounced.
171320	176240	At an event I was helping to host at university, I got his autograph, I actually got his autograph
176240	179400	on my philosophy uni notes as it turned out.
179400	180640	Not one of his books.
180640	185720	The name of the subject in which the uni notes were compiled was called God, Life, the Universe
185760	189880	and everything which was right up his alley and the lecture notes actually had excerpts
189880	192080	from one of his books that I proudly showed him.
192080	194640	I was literally studying his stuff at the time.
194640	198800	So I ended up having a brief conversation with Paul Davies, winner of the Templeton Prize
198800	202440	and I kind of thought that in my early 20s this was a pretty good accomplishment for
202440	206640	an undergrad physics student still living with their parents in an exceedingly typical
206640	212160	home on a typical street and a typical suburb, one among hundreds in greater Sydney, Australia.
212160	217600	I guess to put it in perspective it would have been rather like an aspiring pop singer
217600	222760	just happening to bump into Michael Jackson or Madonna or for younger listeners Justin
222760	223760	Bieber.
223760	228640	So that was the late 90s by which time I'd already read The Fabric of Reality by David
228640	233920	Deutsch multiple times and the remarkable thing about having read that book was that
233920	236280	I just had to talk about it with someone.
236280	240480	I think many people who read the book end up feeling that way, it's kind of unique
240480	241480	in that respect.
241480	242800	It doesn't happen often.
242800	247040	As much as I loved Paul Davies books I never really felt a need to disgust them with groups
247040	250160	of people but David's book was different.
250160	252760	But sadly there was no one to really talk to about it.
252760	257480	At university the people around me, even in my physics lectures, just didn't seem to
257480	258840	get the significance of it.
258840	261200	Well of course they hadn't read it to begin with.
261200	266480	At the same time I was reformulating my own thoughts from decades of schooling and some
266480	271920	years of tertiary education in light of what The Fabric of Reality was saying about the
271920	273360	nature of knowledge and so on.
273360	278200	I was converted by that book to the many worlds interpretation of quantum theory.
278200	279520	In other words, realism.
279520	281920	I was converted to popurian epistemology.
281920	287200	In other words, I had some insight into what knowledge actually was and how it was created.
287200	292120	But whenever I mentioned either of those things, let's say many worlds to a physics tutor
292120	297600	or professor or popper to a philosophy tutor or professor, I barely ever got more than
297600	302480	a shrug or maybe a hint that I should go and read about Bohmian mechanics or maybe take
302480	307400	more seriously what Feynman had to say about understanding quantum theory or in the case
307400	312760	of popper to look more deeply into the Vienna circle and what Wittgenstein had to say on
312760	314800	the matters that Popper was writing about.
314800	318800	In other words, in both cases there were not many sympathetic ears.
318800	323760	Now I cannot remember exactly how it happened, and this is in the era before Google, but
323760	328800	some search engine or other allowed me to eventually find myself online in the late
328800	335400	90s and the early 2000s able to, now and again, fire a question to David Deutch himself via
335400	337960	email about The Fabric of Reality.
337960	342960	I was astonished that he was the guy, the inventor of quantum computation, that seemingly
342960	347920	no one much knew about, but seemed to know a heck of a lot more and make considerably
347920	354400	more sense than anyone else I'd ever encountered in academia or intellectual circles.
354400	360600	I was one of the privileged few in retrospect who knew a second book was on the way, though
360600	365120	we never knew what it would be called nor when it would arrive, but the anticipation
365120	368680	grew over the decade until finally it was published.
368680	374480	I think perhaps only Star Wars fans waiting for the next canonic film to drop know exactly
374480	375480	that same feeling.
375560	377600	Well, even in that case they don't really.
377600	383120	Films are a transient thing, but a book, like The Beginning of Infinity, is kind of bottomless
383120	386760	in a way that no other consumable content quite is.
386760	391880	So I've been a fan of David Deutch for decades now, so it still blows my mind that I could
391880	397600	be in a position to actually just have a chat with him as we do here, albeit from the other
397600	403520	side of the world, and on that, me being far closer to Antarctica than most of the population
403520	408040	of the planet, and most people who are listening to this will be far closer to the Arctic,
408040	413720	the finiteness of the speed of light did catch David and I out on more than one occasion,
413720	419360	making this episode, in some places, a little bit disjointed so editing was required for
419360	423600	listenability in some places, but hopefully I've done a good enough job that you don't
423600	424600	notice.
424600	426200	I'm not a polished interviewer, of course.
426200	431440	This seemed to be half conversation, half interview, and I have learned now on putting
431440	436080	this together to not speak over the person I am talking to, or try to fill pauses with
436080	437840	noises of agreement.
437840	442320	I have learned those lessons now, but I did not know them beforehand, which means there
442320	447080	are some places where I do seem to forget I am being recorded.
447080	452320	As this is episode 100, a sort of announcement is in order, that being that Topcast will
452320	458280	continue to go from strength to strength in a space of podcast that seems to expand continuously,
458280	462080	but I think there is a nice little niche here that needs to be filled, so I'll continue
462080	467440	doing what I do, but with more energy thanks to the support of Patreons, and especially
467440	473120	of course to Navarre Ravacart, who's own worldview and wisdom aligns so closely with
473120	478000	the optimism, view of progress, and wealth of David Deutsch, and what I am trying to
478000	479120	promote here.
479120	484720	So I'll continue doing what I do, which is long form podcasts, especially on Deutsch's
484720	489600	The Fabric of Reality, Marletto's The Science of Can and Can't, and Pinker's Rationality
489600	490600	for now.
490600	496040	But I'll also be broadening out and refining things, making lots more stand alone episodes
496040	501360	and really tightening things up on some of the ideas we like to talk about here, and making
501360	505400	far more brief podcasts as well.
505400	509160	And maybe now and again I'll do the odd recorded conversation once in a while.
509160	514680	So look forward to that in the coming weeks and months and years if you're a fan.
514680	518360	This introduction is already longer than I hoped for, but I actually haven't done a
518360	523200	job of introduction, which I should do in an episode like this, I need to introduce
523200	524200	my guest.
524200	527760	But of course David needs no introduction, especially if you're listening to this as
527760	535600	a subscriber of Topcast, because Topcast is largely a podcast devoted to the work and
535600	540880	worldview of David Deutsch, the inventor of the theory of quantum computation, author
540880	545600	of the first quantum algorithm, intellectual successor to the epistemology and philosophy
545600	550480	of Karl Popper, author of The Fabric of Reality and The Beginning of Infinity, creator of
550480	555440	Constructor Theory, David is a Fellow of the Royal Society, winner of the Dirac Prize
555440	562560	in 1998 for quote, pioneering work in quantum computation leading to the concept of a quantum
562560	567960	computer and for contributing to the understanding of how such devices might be constructed from
568040	570880	quantum gates in quantum networks.
570880	577360	And he was also the co-winner of the Dirac Medal in 2017 for quote, building the foundations
577360	579960	of quantum information science.
579960	583680	His books have won prizes and he has won other prizes as well.
583680	587960	Go to his website and the about me section to find out more about all that.
587960	593040	But as I record this, I've just learned that this week, the final week of November 2021,
593040	597760	David has won the Isaac Newton Medal from the Institute of Physics in the United Kingdom
597760	605320	for quote, founding the discipline named quantum computation and establishing quantum computations
605320	610280	fundamental idea now known as the qubit or quantum bit end quote.
610280	614200	He has now also been elected a Fellow of that Institute of Physics.
614200	619880	Prizes, accolades and accomplishments aside, the impact of David Deutsch on the world is
619880	625760	yet to be fully realized, but it is going to become perhaps something like that of an
625760	630760	Einstein or a Newton or a Darwin in my opinion, which is why we're so lucky to be able to
630760	633560	interrogate him once in a while.
633560	638000	Once the first fully functional universal quantum computer is built, the landscape of
638000	639280	the world will change.
639280	643640	When the average person understands and appreciates that its function can only be explained by
643640	647520	recourse to a multiverse, the intellectual world will change.
647520	652080	When people look back in retrospect and realize he was right all along in what he said about
652080	658760	quantum computation and therefore about explanations and hence popper, the world will be changed.
658760	663760	We can only hope that that change goes deeper still into how the education of young people
663760	669160	is handled, how we deal with problems both known and unknown and why progress, optimism
669160	674040	and wealth need to motivate us all individually and as a civilization.
674040	678360	The world will be changed and we will see that what I've just said about putting David
678360	683400	alongside the biggest names in science and philosophy is neither hyperbole or hubris.
683400	684600	It is a serious claim.
684600	687880	I just wish it would all happen far sooner.
687880	689720	But that's enough of an introduction.
689720	692920	I'll have a few brief remarks at the end of this.
692920	698880	But for now, I present to you my interview, my discussion, my conversation with David
698880	702880	Dodge.
702880	705960	Okay, well thanks very much anyway for doing this David.
705960	712040	It's a real honor to talk to you and be able to record this conversation.
712040	719120	And this book that I've spent the last few years exploring now is unlike just about any
719120	723680	other to my mind and I've said this a few times that it's unlike other popular science
723680	726960	books because it's not really a popular science book.
726960	731560	One thing that it contains within it that is different to other science books is what
731560	737120	I might say are sort of discoveries in philosophy and physics or at the very least new ways
737120	742680	of refining and explaining material you've put out there elsewhere in other forms perhaps.
742680	747280	The first time this seems to crop up actually is in chapter one, the reach of explanations
747280	752520	and there we get the concept of good explanations, good explanations being actual explanations
752520	755400	that account for what is out there in the world and how it works.
755400	759400	That are hard to vary, these hard to vary explanations.
759400	765040	Now I'm convinced and most people who hear about it become convinced over time but I
765040	769200	think there's a lot of people who think well science isn't it just about testable theories?
769200	771960	Why isn't testable theories enough?
771960	779880	So there was a lot about explanations even in my first book and some careful readers
780240	788280	pointed out that I'd never actually explained what an explanation is in Fabrica reality.
788280	795160	In fact I seem to have taken a bit of a cop out path by saying just saying about explanations
795160	802720	that there isn't any closed list of attributes that an explanation must have and that's because
802720	808200	it seemed to me that and I think it does seem to many people that the difference between
808200	819200	an explanation and a prediction is obvious but to most people it was quite opaque.
819200	824600	So I thought about it and this is indeed one of the few things that I will acknowledge
824600	831040	is kind of a bit of an innovation in the beginning of infinity.
831040	840200	I thought about what exactly makes the difference and I thought of some examples such as the
840200	845560	explanation of the seasons as opposed to predicting them and then I think that the example that
845560	855160	I like best although again not everyone does is the example of the conjurer where you go
855320	863920	in and you go in to see this conjuring performance and you see some cups and balls and the conjurer
863920	870960	puts the ball under the cup and after a while you begin to predict that the cup where he
870960	873960	puts the ball under is not going to be the one where it ends up.
873960	877640	But that doesn't mean you can explain what's going on in the trick.
877640	884760	Yeah exactly so you can predict quite confidently that the ball isn't there and there you are
884840	891000	it's vindicated but that's not what you mean by how is the trick done.
891000	900520	What you mean is what has happened to bring about the thing you saw and so you're not asking for
900520	906600	an account of the thing you saw even a perfect prediction of the thing you saw you're asking
906600	908600	about the thing you didn't see.
908600	914680	Yes and this comes up so often throughout the book really and I think it's a subtle
914680	921400	point easily missed and of course the other example that you use and that you often go to is
921400	927320	this idea of dinosaurs the one thing that you actually can't observe is indeed the one thing
927320	931800	that you're invoking as actually existing and causing the phenomena that you do observe.
933640	937800	And in all these cases that unobserved thing is the thing that you're really interested in.
937800	942040	It's the only reason you're interested in any kind of prediction at all.
942040	949720	Yes and now this concept of then hard to vary where all the parts of the explanation have some
949720	955560	functional role and this is really what makes the explanation a good explanation as opposed to
956200	961640	any arbitrary account that could be easily varied mythological accounts and so on magical accounts.
962360	967480	Did that come to you did you have that in mind during the fabric of reality writing it then or
967480	972280	did it only come later in light of people saying you know can you sharpen up what you mean by
972280	979480	explanation. It's the latter I like I said while I was writing fabric of reality I kind of thought
979480	985560	that these were rather foolishly I thought that these were words that had an uncontroversial
985560	994520	meaning and it didn't occur to me that that that most people would not have this meaning in mind
994600	1000920	although many people did so in that sense it wasn't something I invented
1001640	1009480	something that I realized needs to be elaborated to be written down more clearly
1010200	1014680	and then I started to think about well things that are explanations and things that aren't explanations
1015480	1021400	and like the ancient myths and so on and and then I thought with the with the conjurer
1022360	1029800	there are circumstances where the conjurer did it is the explanation that the person wants
1029800	1038440	yes you can imagine a person who believes in magic and is is sort of slowly coming out of that
1038440	1047320	state of mind like like James Randi's family when the historian when he was a teenager and when he
1047320	1055560	first exposed a fake psychic and and was horrified to find that most of the people in the audience
1055560	1060840	didn't want to know the truth yeah right yeah that happened more than once there was a famous I don't
1060840	1064760	know if you know the famous story that he was on Australian television he did the same to the
1064760	1071400	spoon bender Yuri Geller on one of our daytime lunchtime talk back television shows and the
1071400	1075800	audience was very upset with him and indeed the host was as well and stormed off the set he did
1075800	1084840	the same thing to Randy wow right so there there you have it I mean that that anger would happen
1085560	1092360	I suppose whether or not he revealed how he did it it was the fact that he was revealing that he
1092360	1099640	did do it that was the thing that angered them and that that was the relevant explanation in context
1099640	1107080	so that's why I have to say it's an explanation is hard to vary while still solving the problem
1107080	1112840	that it purports to solve yes which might be different for different people as well in the same
1112840	1118360	situation okay so you mentioned that that piece of sort of prosaic terminology explanation that
1119400	1124200	we all use but I think that you've put a spin on it that is is quite helpful but
1124280	1129320	turning to another word a word that you in fact don't use and it brings me to chapter two
1129960	1133320	and that's called and don't worry I'm not going to go through every single chapter chronologically
1133320	1139880	but uh then just a few of them um but chapter two is titled closer to reality but Karl Popper
1139880	1146040	had this term very silamitude which means something like closer to truth and it seems to me you've
1146040	1152040	deliberately avoided that word but why is it because it contains a misconception it's misleading or
1152040	1157480	it's a needless neologism what would be the reason to avoid such a word I think all of those things
1157480	1162040	and I think even even Popper I don't know the history of this very well but I think even Popper
1162040	1171320	went off it Popper in general was very into logic uh this is I think partly uh a sign of the times
1171320	1178120	that that uh the people who were uh doing the prevailing philosophy of science at the time
1178200	1183880	and positivism and logical positivism many of them were logicians and mathematical logicians
1183880	1191320	even Popper wanted a Popper originally uh didn't want to even to mention truth at all
1191960	1197960	and then he got converted by by Tarski and he tells a story uh about how they were sitting
1197960	1203160	on a park bench in Vienna and Tarski explained the correspondence theory of truth to him and he
1203160	1210440	realized that this is this is in fact a useful concept after all but I wonder what logical
1210440	1215320	scientific discovery would have looked like if he had in fact written the whole of it without
1215320	1222440	ever mentioning truth I think it it would have been worse in some ways in that it's it's difficult
1222440	1228920	to make the case for realism if you don't have a concept of truth and Popper was very keen to
1228920	1235480	formulate a realistic philosophy of science but on the other hand when you do introduce truth and
1235480	1243000	especially verisimilitude then the idea is that somehow we can utter truth or at least we can
1243000	1248360	utter something that's 90 true or something like that and we'd have thereby a method of measuring
1248360	1253400	that 90 percent I think verisimilitude was was not intended to be something you could measure
1253480	1260280	right but uh if if you can't measure it then its only use is a sort of philosophical
1261160	1270600	regulating principle and uh I think knowledge and problems are much better concepts probably
1270600	1278200	Popper's fundamental concept the way the way it turned out when when after all these experiments
1278200	1283800	with different conceptual frameworks or whatever well it is the idea of a problem because that
1283800	1290920	comes up not only in his philosophy of science but in his political philosophy as well and more
1290920	1301960	generally he he he generalizes it to even the problem situation of a gene now I'm not sure even
1301960	1309400	I would go that far but it's a very unifying concept and on the other hand I don't think
1309400	1318920	verisimilitude is useful at all and as I said even truth one has to be very careful to to use the
1318920	1327160	concept of truth only as a property of abstractions and never as something you can actually measure
1327160	1335960	or or know have have a direct access to so therefore would you avoid even saying that
1336920	1341960	scientific explanations or indeed explanations in any domain that we happen to be interested in
1341960	1348040	would even be approximately true because that would also entail some kind of quantitative
1348040	1353080	claim about how close we are or can we still use that word can we still say it's approximately true
1353080	1360200	or it's a it's there's some degree of accuracy in this claim about I think we we can use it
1360200	1367560	because again depending on the problem situation if one is speaking informally then one can use
1368120	1374840	imprecise terminology I just caught myself just a moment ago saying probably so you know I'm
1374840	1381480	generally opposed to the whole concept of probability I think it's a scam yes but but that
1381480	1386680	doesn't mean that in in everyday life we don't know what we mean when we're saying some
1387960	1393960	proper was probably meant so and so I don't mean that there was a stochastic process where he
1394680	1401400	where he could have meant something else with with the probability 0.15 yeah I often find
1401400	1407880	myself catching myself precisely the same way that you said generally it kind of has left my
1407880	1413960	vocabulary in just in day-to-day life using the word probably but I at the same time I don't
1414600	1419080	you know chastise myself too much because in order to communicate normally you know people
1419080	1425480	are going to use this word they understand I think yes what we mean and there is no such thing as a
1425480	1432680	perfectly precise language yes so we want to use terms and ways of understanding things that are
1432680	1440680	suitable to the problem that would bring me to my next question describing people for example as
1440680	1445000	chemical scum might be a very loose way of understanding what people are but Hawking did it
1445000	1452680	and you have an excellent refutation of this claim that Stephen Hawking did make which seems to be
1452680	1459320	the reasonably scientific way of understanding our place in the universe he said that we are just a
1459320	1464920	chemical scum on the surface of a typical planet orbiting a typical star and so on but you say
1464920	1472040	this place is not typical is it in in what sense isn't it typical I think the the the description of
1472040	1480200	humans as a chemical scum on earth is not accurate in the problem situation in which Hawking used
1480200	1490760	that term it's we are certainly made of chemicals but so is the rest of the earth and so so is all
1490760	1501320	other so is all other matter in the universe so to single us out as a scum in in these if you're
1501320	1509320	going to take these terms in the context of trying to describe something purely in terms in reductionist
1509320	1517960	terms of their constituents then it is simply false to add a pejorative term that pejorative
1517960	1526120	term comes from a different problem situation and a different vocabulary is needed it would be enough
1526120	1533080	to say we are chemicals like everything else in the universe and then you see that it would be
1533080	1538760	silly to call the earth a chemical scum or the sun or the solar system or the milky way galaxy
1539480	1547000	as as a chemical scum though in the sense in which we are it is too so we are a a special a
1547000	1554840	very special kind of chemical but then would that entail that the earth is special by virtue of the
1554840	1562920	fact that it is uniquely suited to ensuring that this set of chemicals called us is able to survive
1563240	1570680	off into some future that we are only sustained by the existence of this planet and we'll only
1570680	1574840	continue to be sustained by this planet so therefore we better look after the environment or else
1575400	1582840	we're going to go extinct yeah so you're putting that in a in a deliberately exaggerated way that
1582840	1588680	makes it much more wrong you could have said that with one tenth the emphasis and it would still be
1588680	1597640	wrong now it's true that the earth is is that living things can exist on earth only by virtue of
1597640	1606600	the fact that the earth provides by astronomical standards a very unusual set of circumstances
1606600	1614200	which if if they were to vary by astronomical standards by only a few percent then without
1614280	1620920	a lot of technology we would die and living things in general would die without technological
1620920	1630520	help but that doesn't at all mean that the earth is adapted to human existence or even to life but
1630520	1639640	especially to human existence very accurately it it it would be more true to say that the earth
1639640	1651160	is barely suitable for life it it provides a relatively stable temperature and sunlight
1651160	1658760	and living things manage to use that even though it's not very conveniently provided
1658760	1667400	and that that took it hundreds of millions of years to work out and the rest was provided by
1667400	1676680	life itself and most of the rest as far as humans go was provided by humans there there are very
1676680	1686680	very few places on earth that humans can live comfortably without technology that is without
1687240	1694840	ideas provided by them and not provided by the earth so i don't know maybe some south sea islands
1695640	1702680	with suitable coconuts or whatever they have there and even that would be a trap
1702680	1710280	because we are so constituted that if we did live in such an environment for some generations
1710280	1716440	our numbers would increase to the point when we will live it where we were living in misery again
1717000	1726120	so the earth is where living on earth what has been provided is really just the bare
1726120	1732440	necessities for us to live somewhere originally the great lift rift valley or something and the
1732440	1741320	rest has to be provided by us yes so the earth is not adapted to life but life can adapt itself to
1741320	1748040	the earth but the only thing that is going to survive in the long run in terms of regular life
1748040	1751960	not intelligent life like ourselves are the genes the genes are going to want to try and
1751960	1758840	make themselves survive and the animals won't care or the other species don't have this concept of
1758840	1766600	caring into the infinite future about their own survival however we do so we want to adapt ourselves
1766600	1773720	to the earth in some way or if not the earth and something far larger we want to adapt ourselves
1773720	1779000	to the universe in which we find ourselves and the one thing that enables us to do that is of
1779000	1785320	course solving our problems continually to create the knowledge in order to enable us to do so and
1785320	1792600	you have the great dichotomy of saying problems are inevitable but problems are soluble and here
1793160	1798840	i have heard over the years people push back against this especially the second part that
1798840	1806040	problems are soluble for example they argue we can't know everything and they will invoke
1806040	1811160	that it's provably the case that given girdle's result there are true statements we cannot prove
1811160	1816440	are true so there is some and there are some mathematics that's not decidable so some problems
1816440	1821960	are not soluble isn't isn't that correct what's the what's the argument against that line of
1821960	1832120	reasoning i i think that the this line of reasoning is reaching for a standard of knowing
1832120	1839080	that is impossible for anything it's it's not possible to know even provable things by the
1839080	1844760	standard that they're asking to know unprovable things when we say that something is provable
1845320	1853640	we mean that it's provable from certain axioms and girdle's theorem is about provability which
1853640	1861320	means provability from axioms now if you if you have an undecidable statement in some formal system
1861320	1867560	and if it was true you could always add that as another axiom and then it would be provable
1868280	1873480	so you might ask yeah but but how do we know that that statement you're adding is true
1874120	1881560	if we can't prove it well unfortunately that objection applies to any set of axioms and it
1881560	1889560	applies to the original set of axioms as well and uh this is this is uh a mistake that has been made
1889560	1896600	by many mathematicians even after girdle i think it was made by virtually all mathematicians before
1896600	1906280	girdle but even after mathematicians tend to think that there is a class of axioms that don't
1906280	1913480	need proof or something that that they are self proving or self self evident or they come from
1913480	1920680	mathematical intuition which is infallible or something like that but in fact the the axioms
1920680	1929000	the rules of inference in logic that for example if the proposition a and b is true then it is
1929000	1937560	necessarily the case that b is also true now it seems self-evident but uh it is not provable
1937560	1944920	so uh what are you going to do are you going to say that this is a problem that is insoluble
1944920	1950520	and therefore it's not true that problems are soluble no people don't don't bother saying it with
1951080	1957240	with axioms because they have this misconception that axioms are somehow enshrined by god or
1957240	1963880	something and we can know for sure that they are true yes but that's not what knowledge is about
1963880	1969800	we are trying to solve problems we're not trying to establish truths and uh girdle's
1969880	1975480	yes uh theorem is not about establishing truth either it's about deriving things from other
1975480	1984040	things yes yes and these some one uh line of discussion i often pursue here and correct me
1984040	1992680	if i'm wrong but this vast class of undecidable or unprovable statements which must vastly out
1992680	2000360	number the number that are provable statements they're in a sense uninteresting because that's
2000360	2007800	not what the claims of science physics for example consist of and so they don't have
2007800	2013080	and again i would i would appeal to your better knowledge on this they don't have any they can't
2013080	2020280	possibly have any effects on our world they're not going to help us to solve problems as we would
2020280	2026280	say we know they exist but beyond that what are they interesting in any way um well they're
2026280	2031160	certainly interesting because mathematics is interesting and and uh where we are interested
2031160	2040040	in abstractions as well as in physical problems um and the reason that that uh it seems implausible
2040040	2047560	at the moment that that um undecidable propositions might be relevant to some practical problem like
2047560	2055720	how to how to feed the world or how to eliminate viruses and and so on is that the undecidable
2055720	2063320	propositions are all about infinite sets infinite sets of things like the set of all numbers and
2063320	2071720	that kind of thing and uh physics as we currently conceive of it the the infinite sets that appear
2071720	2078840	in physics are very tame and don't have these problems in them but that's that's like you know
2078840	2085160	i can conceive that that maybe one day somebody invents a different physical theory where the
2085160	2092600	the undecidability of certain propositions about the real numbers would tell you something about
2092600	2099880	whether well about how to do and how not to do certain things that you want there i think roger
2099880	2107480	penrose once pointed out that certain theories of quantum gravity do depend on turing undecidable
2107480	2115560	propositions basically it's it's like you if you're working out a Feynman diagram to work out how
2116200	2121480	what the probability is that a certain gravitational wave will interact with another gravitational
2121480	2126760	wave you know this is very far from ordinary experience then if you want to work that out
2126760	2133400	accurately you have to do a sum you have to sum the amplitudes for for all possible processes
2133400	2143160	over all geometries and for all possible topologies and to enumerate all possible topologies in the
2143160	2148600	relevant sense i mean i'm not a mathematician i don't know about this stuff but but apparently
2148600	2155880	that's that's an undecidable task and therefore you couldn't work out this probability amplitude
2155880	2162120	for the gravitational wave doing something or other because you would have to have a mathematical
2162120	2169240	expression for all topologies in a in a given sense so that's an example of how in principle
2169240	2177080	laws of physics might have undecidable consequences yes and therefore that the undecidable consequences
2177080	2183480	are actually interesting well it would be physically interesting yes it you know in principle
2183480	2191800	something that you wanted to do might depend on working out this thing but i don't see any
2191800	2197640	particular reason for making a distance as long as we have the necessities of life and comfort
2198600	2205880	i don't see any reason for making a distinction between problems in engineering and in physics
2205880	2211400	and in pure mathematics i mean they're they're all problems they're all conflicts between theories
2211400	2217160	that that interest people people want to know what the resolution is one thing i say in in the
2217160	2225240	book about pure mathematical problems is that sometimes discovering that something is undecidable
2225800	2231800	is the solution to the problem in in the sense that it's the it's what you wanted to know
2232440	2240040	because you you have in mind some some prima facie argument that it that a certain proposition is
2240040	2247080	true and another prima facie argument that it that it's false and then you discover that it's
2247080	2254680	actually undecidable and that explains why you could have these two conflicting intuitions
2254680	2261000	about it and then right you can go and criticize your intuitions in other ways because you know
2261000	2267240	that you're not going to be able to resolve it by proving one of them true or false now you mentioned
2267240	2272760	in that answer there the concept of abstractions and you actually invoked abstractions in in talking
2272760	2277320	about it of course pure mathematics is about abstractions and i don't know what might be the
2277320	2283320	most controversial chapter in the book but i think among intellectual types to at least some extent
2283320	2288840	it would be chapter five if it's not going to be the white flowers a beautiful chapter it's going to
2288840	2295880	be the one that claims there is a reality to abstractions because to some people this seems
2295880	2301320	weirdly enough you know not to me i think not to most people listening to this but it can sound
2301320	2308200	like an appeal to the supernatural or some sort of woo because some people are physicalists they
2308200	2313960	think that everything just has to come down to the behavior of atoms but i wanted to ask you if
2313960	2319400	you distinguish between kinds of abstractions rather than defending the thesis that abstractions are
2319400	2325000	real i know this is not necessarily a well-defined area but for example something like numbers
2325000	2332120	they're abstractions are they different in kind to let's say knowledge because after all there may
2332120	2337000	be infinitely well there are infinitely many prime numbers and not all of those prime numbers ever
2337000	2342520	need to be instantiated in a physical substrate anywhere nevertheless they still exist but knowledge
2342520	2349560	to be knowledge has to be extantiae instantiated in a physical substrate it's also abstract but
2350200	2355720	well i might pull the brakes there can you explain if there are these different species of
2355720	2363880	abstractions and if so how do we understand the differences in their existence yes there are
2363880	2370680	different species of abstractions i mean maybe it's better to say there there is a classification
2370680	2378680	of abstractions and some classifications are quite useful because abstractions within the same
2378760	2383160	category of classification have similar properties and can be understood with
2383160	2387720	similar explanations or the same explanation but then with the different problem situations you
2387720	2393320	might want to classify things differently like you know just like in biology we may wish to
2394440	2400600	sometimes we want to classify things as mammals and birds and reptiles and so on and on other
2400600	2408200	occasions we may want to classify them as aquatic creatures and terrestrial creatures and aerial
2408200	2415240	creatures and so on so classifications are useful relative to the problems that they are
2415240	2421400	that you want to talk about and it's the same with abstractions it's definitely true that
2421400	2427960	some abstractions as you say like knowledge and information more generally don't exist unless
2427960	2434920	they're instantiated so they have to have this extra element of being instantiated but that's
2434920	2441480	also true of there are there are more classifications than that even even among pure abstractions
2441480	2448680	there there are abstractions that it seems to be important in mathematics to like i said to
2449400	2455880	distinguish between abstractions that involve infinite sets and abstractions that don't and then
2456600	2463640	the whole idea of a set is is not universally applicable so the set of all sets it famously
2463720	2469640	turned out even before girdle it turned out that this from russell that it turned out that the
2470280	2477160	set of all sets isn't a set um so you then you have to invoke a class it's it's just a class of
2477160	2483160	things or the set of all sets that don't contain itself so there's that's right so there's but
2483160	2487880	it doesn't help because there's it doesn't help with everything because there's no such thing as
2487880	2494680	the class of all classes either right so uh yes there there are different kinds of things and
2494680	2500600	another thing which which i think is still slightly mysterious is what kind of an abstraction the laws
2500600	2506920	of physics are some people think precisely by arguments such as such as you've mentioned that
2507480	2513960	there really are no laws of physics all there are are physical events and physical processes
2513960	2519880	and laws are just a kind of way of summarizing physical events and processes they just are
2519880	2526520	so because i see that that looking out of the window i can see that the sky is cloudless at the
2526520	2535400	moment that is some kind of emergent consequence of the laws of physics but it if it's true then
2537240	2542120	people who deny that there are laws of physics will say well that's just a fact about the universe
2542120	2548200	and you could you could summarize it and say that on three of the four days of this week the sky was
2548200	2555320	clear and that's not a law of nature so why should we why why should there be anything special
2555960	2563640	about the statement that nothing can exceed the speed of light well it's because the statement
2563640	2570280	that nothing exceeds the speed of light is not just a prediction it is an explanation it's an
2570280	2577560	explanation of how the universe is that the universe is a four-dimensional pseudo-rimanian
2577560	2585240	manifold with a metric and and and so on and so on and the fact that the speed of light is finite
2586040	2595960	emerges from that explanation and you could write down all the predictions that follow from that
2596760	2603000	uh in a sort of infinitely long list of things like like this dog can't run faster than light and
2603000	2608360	this car can't travel faster than light and what once you've made that uh infinitely long list or
2608360	2614600	maybe just very long very very long list you would have written down everything that can be deduced
2614600	2623560	about what happens in nature but you wouldn't have ever listed that law and you wouldn't have
2623560	2630440	ever mentioned manifolds and four-dimensional or anything like that well you'd have some
2630440	2635480	significant explaining to do wouldn't you uh it well if you wanted explanations you'd have a
2635480	2640920	lot of explaining to do you would in fact have all the explaining to do at the end of that huge
2640920	2647240	process that you had at the beginning you wouldn't have explained anything we were we were just talking
2647240	2654760	about how um the nature of physical laws and whether or not and to what extent they might be
2655400	2660760	pure abstractions or a kind of abstraction of some kind and I was just thinking to myself that
2660760	2667880	for anyone who denies the existence of physical laws in their own right laws of physics and to
2667880	2674360	just say well there are just facts of matter about the universe for example the orbits of
2674840	2681160	planets going around stars are approximately circular or elliptical then those facts of the
2681160	2687320	matter those regularities in nature seem to be crying out for an explanation so to deny that
2687320	2693240	there would be really existing physical laws behind those regularities in nature seems to me to be
2693240	2698360	going to a lot of work to avoid what might otherwise be called Occam's razor well isn't
2698360	2703960	the simple explanation there are physical laws out there governing these things yes uh of course
2703960	2711880	if somebody insists on the non-existence of explanations like exactly like insistence on
2711880	2722280	the non-existence of anything you can't be proved wrong but I think the motivation for
2722280	2731000	denying the existence of laws is the old mistake of empiricism it is the assumption
2731960	2742520	that raw facts or raw sensory impressions have a privileged status in that in that we can access
2742520	2749400	them directly and this is this people contrast this with things like laws and explanations in
2749400	2755480	general which they say we can't access directly so so they are they have some kind of a lesser
2755560	2763720	reality and we can in principle not insist on there being real one can insist on there not
2763720	2768040	being real and it doesn't make any difference but the trouble with that is that exactly the
2768040	2775880	same is true of sense impressions as well and so this argument that abstractions don't really
2775880	2783080	exist or that laws don't really exist and so on are hidden in there is the assumption that
2783080	2790040	sense impressions or that kind of thing do really exist in some sense of really which is itself a
2790040	2797880	mistake that all knowledge is conjectural all observations are theory laden there is nothing
2797880	2803880	that is an authoritative source of knowledge everything is conjecture and so what once you've
2803880	2809160	realized that everything is conjecture but that knowledge can still exist then the reason for
2809240	2815240	making a distinction between different kinds of existence well no there is a distinction between
2815240	2822040	different kinds of existence but the justification the motivation for denying that certain things
2822040	2831640	exist even if we need them in our explanations goes away and this once one becomes at least
2831640	2837640	somewhat familiar with the worldview that you've presented in your books and with poppers worldview
2837640	2845640	it's it's very difficult to try and reimagine what people mean by directly observe i i struggle
2845640	2850920	now to try and conceive of what one really means when they say well there are certain things you
2850920	2857640	can just observe you can just see but on explaining to them well let's think about what that whole
2857640	2864600	process of seeing actually consists of of photons you know being absorbed and then re-emitted back
2864600	2868920	towards the eye and then being converted into electrical signals which then go into your brain
2868920	2877240	this this whole concept of direct observation actually itself vanishes into a cloud of explanation
2877240	2884040	not so much a cloud but a a kind of way of understanding the world that denies the possibility
2884040	2890200	of direct observation i don't even know what someone really intends by this terminology this
2890200	2896280	why of denying the reality of things which we don't have direct observe don't have direct
2896280	2903240	access to when we don't have direct access to anything even i would tentatively argue that
2903240	2910600	even the contents of our own minds i agree in a way the contents of our own minds are are quite a
2910600	2917880	highly sophisticated kind of knowledge that we only know through an extensive chain of interpretations
2917880	2925720	some of which are notoriously unreliable you know even in everyday language we we we know
2925720	2934760	what we mean when we say you're just fooling yourself or the content of those ideas is incompatible
2934760	2941880	with empiricism with the idea that knowledge reliable knowledge comes from the senses and
2941880	2947640	i think people regard that as just one of those things you know it's it's it's one of the mysteries
2947640	2954440	of nature it's it's the problem of induction or something like that and you say it's hard to imagine
2955160	2961960	what people mean when they when they talk about direct observation it's interesting that that
2961960	2968760	concept of direct observation also had to be invented at one time and in fact it was quite a
2968760	2975640	liberation when it was first invented like in various stages there was there was empiricism
2975640	2983720	in in the john lock sense is relatively recent but but the idea that we can gain knowledge
2983720	2991000	by looking at the world which is false was these concepts of knowledge and looking and reliable
2991000	2997240	and that kind of thing they're not built into our genes somebody invented those concepts and at
2997240	3003000	the time when they invented them they were an improvement on on something that was more vague
3003000	3009480	and more false than that trust the authority or something for example yes but there was a time
3009480	3015800	when you didn't even have to say trust the authorities when uh trusting the authorities
3015800	3021080	was just the way that the world was and nobody bothered to put that into words that reminds
3021080	3028840	me of the divine right of kings which is a concept that was invented only after the authority of kings
3028840	3036520	was questioned yes well this all raises the fact that there is this creativity going on this creation
3036520	3044200	of concepts in order to try and come to better understand the world that is the uniquely creative
3044200	3050920	capacity of the human mind and mind itself how do you understand the nature of mind i sometimes
3050920	3056360	think of it as this abstraction i think you've said this to me it's a it's a it's a it's a funny
3056360	3062520	kind of abstraction it's an abstraction that itself needs to be instantiated in matter but also
3062520	3067960	needs to be running it can't just be like any other piece of knowledge which you can transmit
3067960	3073000	from one place to another in different physical forms and that's one way of understanding what
3073000	3078120	knowledge is it allows itself to continue to persist over time and to get itself copied to get
3078120	3085000	itself replicated but our mind a human mind this thing that is enabling the creation of this knowledge
3085000	3092440	it itself it is an unusual kind of abstraction how do you think of it at the moment yes so it's
3092440	3099400	an unusual kind of knowledge so we have yet another classification uh a mind is a kind of a
3099400	3105240	kind of knowledge you might say but it's a kind of knowledge that doesn't only have to be instantiated
3105240	3112840	but as you have just said it has to be running now what does that mean running how fast running in
3112840	3121640	what because uh running in the wrong kind of computer would make it gibberish or in a kind of
3121640	3127400	computer that has the wrong mapping to to reality we don't know how it works we don't know how the
3127400	3133160	mind so the mind is characterized by creativity i think we can go that far at least the human
3133160	3138840	mind is characterized by creativity but we don't know what creativity is we don't know what
3138840	3144920	the distinction is between a computer program that is running creatively and one that is not
3144920	3151800	running creatively uh one day we will know but we don't know yet i i think also there are and again
3151800	3158200	minds that minds exist is common sense even though we don't know how they work or what specifically
3158200	3167400	they are so more recent ideas that maybe minds don't exist that had to be invented too uh it is
3167400	3173080	not at all common sense and it doesn't at all follow from any good philosophy but we don't know
3173960	3181240	and uh one of the things i think that that is a misconception that dates from a very long time
3181240	3189720	ago is is that a mind is like mostly consistent that it consists of uh the ideas in the mind
3190440	3197400	are mostly consistent and when they're inconsistent that's a kind of emergency and and we have to
3197400	3202840	fix that because we have because that does that that means that it's not a proper mind really
3203560	3210280	um it's it's uh contains inconsistencies rather and therefore that's no different from
3211000	3218280	uh a load of propositions written down on a piece of paper i don't think that's true at all i i i think
3218920	3226040	a better way to think of the mind is as a set of problems and a problem consists of conflicting
3226040	3233560	theories so uh or rather a problem is is more like some conflicting theories that we have noticed
3233560	3239080	because we don't really think of something as a problem unless it's giving rise to some thought
3239080	3245320	so uh but but there must be ideas that are conflicting with each other before we have noticed
3245320	3253080	it and so the mind i i think of it as sort of massive tangled ideas which are largely inconsistent
3253160	3260120	the parts of it which we have sorted out into a kind of consistency are a minority
3261320	3267160	that are currently not uh giving rise to any thought they might be invoked in some
3267960	3274360	thought that's about some other inconsistency but the part of the mind that is thinking is
3274360	3281880	full of inconsistency and so therefore a model of the mind that thinks of the mind as a set of
3281880	3291000	consistent propositions with occasional inconsistencies that we then fix it is uh i i i think very far
3291000	3299240	from the truth it's it's not a set of consistent ideas and it's not a set of propositions because
3299240	3306120	propositions have a definite truth value they each proposition is either true or false and it has a
3306120	3313160	perfectly definite meaning if it has a meaning uh whereas the ideas in minds don't have a definite
3313160	3320600	meaning and they're not precisely true or false we can make them have as sharp a meaning as our
3320600	3326920	current problem situation requires that's what we should be aiming for and we can make them as
3326920	3334600	consistent as the current problem situation requires and we're striving you talked earlier about
3334600	3341160	about uh truth we're striving to make them as true as the current problem situation requires
3341160	3348520	yes so it sounds that whatever the nature of the mind is in a computational sense has to be
3349160	3356840	radically different to any other kind of program that we've hitherto encountered because all those
3356840	3363160	other programs are written in such a way that it's proposition after proposition perhaps one
3363160	3369640	following from another it's an algorithm of a kind and these statements need to be consistent
3369640	3374840	or the computer program itself isn't going to run but you're saying that it's possibly the case that
3375560	3381160	underlying this uniquely creative capacity of the human mind is something that is quite the
3381160	3387400	mirror image of that in in at least some respects and maybe this is this is what is needed in order
3387400	3393960	to uh go some way to explaining what's going on here with um uh creativity or another way
3394760	3401000	that you've put that in the beginning infinity is of course um explanatory universality this idea
3401000	3409880	that even if there were other kinds of creativity prior to us what we have is a kind of creativity
3409880	3416840	which allows us to create knowledge which is going to be able to solve problems in principle
3416840	3421480	about anything that exists in the physical universe which brings me to one of my little
3421480	3428280	hobby horses which is this uh concept that people sometimes raise that well there might be snalions
3428280	3433800	out there the super advanced aliens who are going to have uh some successor to the successor to the
3433800	3438600	successor of the unification of quantum theory in general relativity and even if they could bring it
3438600	3444280	to us we wouldn't understand it it would be written in a mathematics that's too complicated
3444280	3451080	for us or consists of concepts that are beyond our puny human minds to understand either that or
3451080	3455640	you know the super intelligence is going to come along at some point in the future and it too is
3455640	3461000	going to recognize that it's so much smarter than us and we probably all deserve to be exterminated
3461000	3468280	something like that um what's wrong with these I think quite commonly held views about other
3468280	3473560	kinds of minds super advanced alien minds or super intelligent artificial intelligences
3473560	3479880	again of course we can't prove that such things don't exist uh there's there's a very famous one
3479880	3488280	called god which there have been disputes about um uh for many centuries they have
3491640	3498120	yes I I mean uh even the bible speaks of unbelievers so they they must have existed at
3498120	3507400	right yes um and to be a believer in that kind of entity means that you're you're believing in an
3507400	3516200	entity whose mind whose mental processes are first of all not embedded in physics not instantiated
3516200	3522840	in physics in in the same way that ours are and also that they can reach further they can understand
3522840	3529400	things that things embedded in mere physics can never understand and you can't prove that's false
3530120	3538200	but it is a bad explanation as I as I point out in the beginning of infinity and so one thing is that
3538200	3543720	that there are many such theories and there are there are many theories about such entities
3544440	3552520	whether they be snalians or gods or devils or demons or artificial general intelligences
3553000	3559560	those theories since they're bad explanations they have the property that uh if two people
3559560	3566920	such believers in different ones come to persuade me of their view then there's nothing I can do
3566920	3573400	to choose between them it's it's uh like they are invoking some non-understandable thing
3573400	3579480	and the two of them are invoking some two non-understandable things with a non-understandable
3579480	3585320	difference between them so uh I would like to you know put both those people into a sack
3585960	3591800	and tie it shut and then only have to debate with the survivor just for efficiency
3593400	3600200	very good so that that that's related to this idea that again problems are soluble and what I
3600200	3606200	would suggest is that a kind of a special case of that almost is that the all evils are due to
3606200	3610920	lack of knowledge principle of optimism that you have but here it's really interesting the
3610920	3617000	principle of optimism this claim that all evils are due to a lack of knowledge seems to be linking
3617000	3624200	quite strongly epistemology stuff about knowledge to evil stuff about morality isn't that a big
3624200	3630760	leap surely people who do evil things are doing evil things because of their ideas which is to say
3630760	3636360	what they know it's not a lack of knowledge is it it's it's a it is the presence of some knowledge
3636360	3643240	oh well that's the same thing uh they they they are doing it because their knowledge is inadequate
3643240	3651880	is false in in some relevant way and even the the good guys their knowledge is better than the
3651880	3658200	bad guys but it's still not true it's not perfect it can be improved the good in fact the good guys
3658200	3664360	are characterized to a large extent by the fact that they are open to correcting their existing
3664360	3671400	knowledge and to adopting better ideas that they previously didn't know yes I think it it's the
3671400	3678840	it's the natural thing it should be one's first guess that moral knowledge is included in in the
3678840	3686200	same epistemology as physical or mathematical knowledge because as I've said the arguments
3686280	3691080	that there are different kinds of knowledge depending on some kind of privilege access to
3691080	3697400	one or the other is just a mistake it's it's uh you know empiricism or something of the kind
3698040	3706520	that that is is just a not understanding the conjectural nature of all ideas yes and that
3706520	3713000	include must include moral ones and mathematical ones and physical ones and and so on and the
3713080	3718520	uniformly the way to get better ideas is to try to get better explanations in the light of the
3718520	3724200	problems that one has with those ideas there might be I think there's even another way that
3724840	3732200	the beginning of infinity does create a strong link in one's mind between epistemology and
3732200	3737560	morality and that would be in the moral injunction do not destroy the means of error correction so
3737560	3743160	there we have you know error correction that's epistemology and do not do this thing okay so
3743160	3749960	there's a moral claim now I wanted to focus on this for a minute because this might raise an issue
3749960	3755640	within constructor theory and that this is your new physics along with your new theory of physics
3755640	3760840	along with Chiara Marletto about the physics of the possible and the impossible or the possible
3760840	3766440	and impossible transformations I think is one way it might be described and among many things to be
3766440	3772040	excited about with this approach is the link it seems to me between physics and epistemology and
3772040	3778040	we already know some of this story we we know that what can be proven in mathematics depends
3778040	3781880	on what we know about what the laws of physics are and how the laws of physics operate and
3781880	3786040	because we know that proofs in mathematics are a kind of computation computation requires a
3786040	3789800	computer the computer has to be made out of something they made out of matter the matter
3789800	3794760	obeys laws of physics so we can only prove things that the laws of physics say it is possible to
3794760	3800600	prove but constructor theory seems to be generalizing this further I'm not sure if that'd be fair to say
3800600	3806040	so we're going beyond mathematics now and perhaps into realms where we are saying look some things
3806040	3810840	are not possible to know and some things are possible to know even outside of mathematics but
3810840	3815800	there may be things impossible to know in history for example or in science because there'll be no
3815800	3821720	transformation allowing us to actually construct the knowledge that solves the problem there but
3821720	3827080	this if I've just gone way off the rails in my reasoning here would seem to contradict the
3827080	3833560	problems a soluble claim in the beginning infinity though the one example I want to call on I think
3833560	3837560	you might have mentioned this in the fabric of reality I can't remember but it's something to
3837560	3844360	the effect of let's say you wanted to know what Augustus Caesar 8 on his 13th birthday that's a
3844360	3850360	reasonable scientific question but it might also be unknowable but it's not going to be a problem
3850360	3855000	for our understanding because it's going to be inherently uninteresting it's not going to solve
3855000	3861880	any actual historical problems but is this way of thinking about how constructor theory comes to
3861880	3871480	bear on morality and epistemology at all valid I think that one can address that issue without
3871480	3877560	using constructor theory directly if constructor theory works then there will be a theory of
3877560	3882040	knowledge within constructor theory just like there'll be a theory of quantum mechanics within
3882040	3889080	constructor theory we don't know how these subsidiary theories whether these subsidiary
3889080	3894280	theories will be changed or if they have to be changed to what extent they have to be our theory
3894280	3901800	of knowledge is nowhere near as as precise and accurate as theories about physics I don't quite
3901800	3910040	understand your question because suppose we had a problem about Caesar's what Caesar 8 on his 13th
3910040	3916680	birthday I think the example I usually use is Julius Caesar's last meal ah yes yes never mind I mean
3916680	3925160	Augustus Caesar's 13th birthday meal is just as good um if some problem depended on knowing that
3925240	3935640	as a as a solution then it's not accurate to cast this this problem in terms of having to have
3935640	3942200	evidence of what it was you know this is this is not necessarily a question of which observables
3942200	3949000	can be observed in physics we know that most of the observables the detailed observables
3949000	3955560	of the past are have been randomized to such an extent that it would require an infeasible
3955560	3963000	amount of collection of knowledge an infeasible amount of measurement shall we say to to reconstitute
3963000	3970360	it and that might well be true I mean if it isn't true of of these Caesar meal events it'll be true
3970360	3979080	of some lots of events it'll be true of most events at the time so assume that that it is
3979080	3985480	infeasible because of the laws of physics and this could be expressed precisely in constructive theory
3985480	3992040	to measure Julius Caesar's last meal that doesn't mean that we can't solve the problem that gave rise
3992040	3997960	to this question because it can't be a question about physics from from the point of view of
3997960	4004040	physics this is a very uninteresting question so it would be a thing it would be a question about
4004040	4009800	history or about sociology yes or about you know some subject that hasn't been invented yet in which
4009800	4016840	there would be explanations that rival explanations both of which had reasonable arguments in their
4016840	4022360	favor and which somebody decided could be resolved by making this measurement and then it turns out
4022360	4026760	this measurement is impossible well that doesn't mean that it can't be resolved in other ways
4027320	4033960	yes I mean we we know that that last meal was not a cheeseburger
4035400	4043000	and that is not because we have measurements to that effect it's because we have high level theories
4043000	4050840	about the development of human culture and the problem about what he ate etc would have come
4050840	4059080	out of that kind of field yes precisely if we may well come out of that kind of field as well
4059880	4066440	yeah I can only imagine that the question would arise if there was a problem about how and why
4066440	4071880	he died so if it was Julius Caesar and there was some concern that maybe he'd been poisoned
4071880	4078600	just before he died well then there would presumably be theories about you know existing
4078600	4083800	historical documents about how various other people living with him at the time didn't particularly
4083800	4088200	like him and then presumably although we might not be able to tell what his final meal was
4088200	4093560	some very smart forensic scientist might be able to detect some kind of toxin in
4093560	4099240	where his stomach used to be so I imagine that even a problem like this it wouldn't be framed and
4099240	4105640	exactly those words what was his last meal but it might be you know some some some other kind of
4105720	4110520	historical question exactly it would arise out of some problem that wasn't a physics problem for
4110520	4117080	sure yes but by the way there is this problem with Napoleon you know did did he die of wallpaper
4117800	4125240	right because you know it's it's controversial how Napoleon died he wasn't that old
4126600	4134360	and he had some symptoms which are consistent with arsenic poisoning and there were people
4134440	4140040	who who would would have preferred to see him dead and then other people have said well yes it was
4140040	4147000	arsenic poisoning but it was because of the wallpaper the the color of the wallpaper was
4147000	4153880	was caused by arsenic paint and other people who said yes so there was arsenic in the wallpaper
4153880	4159720	but not enough to kill him and so on and so on and this problem is eminently addressable
4160360	4167560	not by going and finding video evidence of the poisoner okay so the following popper and like
4167560	4172520	myself and I was in that tradition we don't place any real currency on the source of an idea
4172520	4176200	because any idea can be evaluated utterly independent of its source or its author
4176200	4181240	and I can take all that on board I think you go even further in this that you're not even interested
4181240	4186680	much in the origin of ideas or the history of ideas and this is actually encapsulated in what
4187480	4191800	Naval has been at pains to point out in his podcast with me anyway but he's not much interested
4191800	4196280	in names who said what and so on it's basically about the ideas and I think that's quite right
4196280	4200840	nevertheless personally and I guess there's a point of indulgence for than anything else
4200840	4205400	I am interested in the history of ideas to some extent so you know I like to know the fact that
4205400	4209800	Einstein really was the prime originator of general relativity but it's interesting to know
4209800	4215240	that Marcel Grausman for example helped him and you know I think one or more of his wives might
4215240	4219800	have helped him as well with the mathematics on general relativity um so it's it's interesting
4219800	4226680	historically about how these great theories kind of came to us what the lineage is now that brings
4226680	4232680	me to this question about quantum computation I'm interested in this because you were inspired
4232680	4240920	obviously by Turing and your paper as of I think it was last week anyway it's now been cited 6122
4240920	4246680	times which is no small feat that that paper being titled quantum theory the church Turing
4246680	4252600	principle in the universal quantum computer what I wanted to ask you about that is as you wrote it
4252600	4257160	because I think when Turing wrote his paper on the Turing machine he was thinking well it's an
4257160	4262920	abstract mathematical object this isn't going to have much I don't know did did he think it was
4262920	4269480	going to have much in the way of a huge industry of engineering these things was going to follow I
4269480	4274360	don't know if that was in his mind but did you have any sense in writing the paper about quantum
4274360	4280760	computation that it would have spawned an industry a multi-billion dollar at the moment industry of
4280760	4291160	racing to build these things did that enter your mind at the time no I was entirely concerned with
4291160	4300840	the laws of physics and that this was a hitherto unsuspected facet of quantum theory that it had
4300840	4309640	this intimate relationship with computation so I had in the back of my mind that maybe this could
4309640	4315800	be built a quantum computer could be built for the purpose of demonstrating or testing
4316280	4321000	properties of the laws of physics of quantum theory but I wasn't concerned with
4322280	4329240	with practical uses of it at all and not even other laboratory uses of it and by the way
4329240	4336200	I think I'm not a so I'm not a historian of science I don't know much about the history of ideas in
4336200	4345560	general yes only certain very narrow facets but I think that history in general is an extremely
4345640	4351640	important worthwhile subject and the history of ideas in particular is I think the most
4351640	4359560	important aspect of history it's just that I happen you know to to have studied other things
4360280	4367560	mostly but I think that Turing was also not interested at the time when he wrote that paper
4368280	4377240	in making anything useful Babbage interestingly was yes and the for him
4378280	4385720	the again I'm going by TV documentaries rather than any real research of my own
4385720	4393720	but it seems that that he was initially concerned with a very practical application of computers
4393800	4400200	namely the autumn automation of the printing of mathematical tables which had to do with
4400200	4408760	navigation and and so on and that he he even when he conceived of the universal version of
4408760	4415320	this machine which was then called the analytical engine he still wasn't then what he saw was this
4415320	4421800	this was a universal machine for arithmetic and for algebra but or not even for algebra I'm not
4421800	4429720	sure for arithmetic at least and it was Lovelace who saw that that this machine would be universal
4429720	4437080	in the sense that we mean today yes yes and so that then that leads me to the question that
4437080	4442280	I don't want it to be too uncomfortable but there is this question about was it church was it
4442280	4447160	Turing and now of course you bring in Babbage as well and Lovelace she says was the first to figure
4447160	4453640	out that these machines could be universal well to what extent do you think Feynman understood
4454200	4461000	the universality of a quantum computation did he have a conception of it at all around the
4461000	4467160	time when you were writing this paper or was it only in light of you telling him about the proof
4467160	4474520	that he then sort of got what you were going on about I don't know I only met him once and we
4474520	4483480	had a long conversation only part of which was about quantum computation and and I was not at all
4483480	4492600	focused on finding out what he knows right okay yes so I don't know but I know that in in his
4492600	4500680	published work there is no real hint of the thing that is now called a universal quantum computer
4500680	4506280	or actually it's now more often called the universal quantum Turing machine which is a very
4506280	4515080	bad bad terminology but there's although he again he was aware that quantum computation
4515080	4521800	could be more powerful than classical computation and he was aware of a certain level of universality
4522760	4532040	but his idea for how to how to make one of these was itself to put on some kind of circuit board
4532600	4540440	a quantum system that had specially tuned Hamiltonians whereas in the real quantum computer
4541560	4547960	the special tuning is itself a quantum program it's there is a single machine you don't have to
4547960	4556600	change the hardware to make to make to to compute a new quantum computation there is a single machine
4556600	4563080	that can be programmed to enact any quantum computation and I I don't think in I don't
4563080	4569400	think there's any hint of that in Feynman's published work although the speed with which
4569400	4577000	he cottoned on to the algorithm that I explained to him suggests that he was on the verge of that
4577000	4585160	either before I spoke to him or just after okay two final just purely for fun questions
4586600	4593240	as you said who cares this is this is true this is true except for historians of science I'm sure
4593240	4599080	in the in the years and decades to come this will be a certainly a point of interest maybe in
4599160	4607080	future they'll analyze the wallpaper and find out yes okay this question is just purely for fun
4607080	4612040	um do you have any opinion on tic-tacs that's a big thing going on at the moment and do you
4612040	4619320	know what I'm talking about no I don't know what it is oh okay so this is the the American military
4619320	4626760	specifically I think the navy who've released these videos of what they say are unidentified
4626760	4632280	objects of some kind and I know this is ridiculous they say things like they're
4632920	4638760	violating laws of physics or at least they are evidence of technology which is not
4639320	4645400	explicable given the current state of technology you haven't heard about these things seen anything
4645400	4649560	about these things nor have any opinion on these things well now that you mention it I I've seen
4649560	4657320	things on twitter right which are now explicable in the light of is it the the American military
4657320	4666680	or something having having said something about UFOs yes I see okay well the opportunities for
4666680	4678200	error are enormous and to perform a scientific experiment that is is a crucial test of sophisticated
4678200	4686200	scientific theories is very very difficult and and universally almost universally underestimated
4686200	4692120	it's sort of taken for granted that that einstein did a very difficult thing but it's not so much
4692120	4698200	understood the stern and gullach who who uh did experiments on quantum superpositions of
4698200	4705160	particles in different positions but they did an amazing thing as well yes good experiments are
4705320	4714440	rare and they require usually a great deal of skill and creativity and it's not the kind of thing
4714440	4728440	that military pilots or policemen are typically cognizant of yes so I think when people like that
4729400	4736680	report a thing that quote violates the laws of physics I would consider it unreasonable
4737320	4743880	to go for any explanation of that other than human error yes yes and of course when you do
4743880	4749400	look at the the footage there is no apparent violation laws of physics even if you grant
4749400	4754760	that this thing is moving at a high velocity beyond anything that we might be capable of that's still
4755480	4761160	sub light speed so it hasn't violated relativity on the one hand and by the way even if you
4761960	4765960	don't have an answer for what's going on there well that's kind of where you might have to
4765960	4771560	stop you don't immediately leap to its uh aliens from the other side of the galaxy um my last question
4771560	4778360	is from my father and I I'll just ask you this before I go it's about dark energy and uh we know
4778440	4785320	the universe is accelerating in its expansion it's behaving as if there is negative pressure
4785320	4791400	on the outside of the observable universe isn't this evidence that the observable universe is
4791400	4799960	actually inside of a much larger region itself of lower density but magnificently greater size
4799960	4804760	perhaps infinite in size and perhaps it's actually got zero density perhaps this void beyond our
4804760	4809800	universe is the thing into which the universe is necessarily expanding because we've got positive
4809800	4813720	pressure inside of our universe and outside of that outside of our universe that's negative
4813720	4819960	pressure could this be a solution so first of all dark energy is just the name given to this
4819960	4825720	anomalous expansion in which we haven't explained yes so I think the reason that dark energy was
4825720	4834280	chosen as a name is because of dark matter where the all reasonable theories of it so far have
4834280	4839480	postulated that it's a kind of matter and it's dark because because it doesn't interact with
4839480	4845480	with photons and so on with dark energy we don't have such a thing we we don't know that there
4845480	4851080	is a source of pressure or that these observations are caused by something pushing on the universe
4851080	4859000	and so on but with the prevailing theories of what dark energy does never mind what it is but
4859000	4868200	what it does the universe is not expanding into anything the universe is is the length scales in
4868200	4877000	the universe are increasing intrinsically and this is the same the same as was the case with the
4877000	4884440	with the prevailing theories before dark energy that the universe initially had well at any rate
4884440	4890120	very near to the big bang it was very small there was a time when it was only the size of an atom
4890120	4895880	there was a time when it was only the size of a neutron and so on and at that time and now it's
4895880	4902520	much bigger the difference between then and now is not that it has expanded to fill a void it has
4902520	4910200	just expanded intrinsically yes and some of the present theories say that it is in fact infinitely
4910200	4917560	large and that it is infinite infinitely large and homogeneous so that the the total amount of
4917560	4924680	matter in it is infinite i don't think that there are any theories i mean one could easily write
4924680	4931720	down a theory in which the universe was inhomogeneous and we are in the only place in it that has
4931720	4937400	matter right yes that wouldn't help in any way with any of the existing theories and more generally
4937400	4945480	by the way theories of inhomogeneity in the universe as far as i know i'm not an expert on this but i
4945480	4950760	think they've only been invoked by people who want to say that there is no dark energy that it's just
4950760	4957800	a coincidence caused by inhomogeneities excellent okay i think that absolutely answered the question
4957800	4961880	i think that will do for now but i hope not for the last time i make my way through the fabric
4961880	4967000	of reality after all now at the moment so perhaps at the end of that we can speak again if not
4967800	4974920	sooner so thank you very much for writing the books i think they've been well the explanations
4974920	4979560	that transform the world i think they've been life transforming for many people so it's been
4979560	4985160	wonderful to talk to you very gratifying today to have this conversation so have a wonderful
4985160	4989320	remainder of the day yourself same to you it's always fun chatting
4990200	5000200	so there we go i hope you enjoyed that i certainly did as i say i'm working on what might be called
5000200	5006040	interview technique it's a steep learning curve the content of deutch and poppers oevoir is deep
5006040	5011800	and subtle enough but adding to that how to run a podcast and being surrounded by new upgraded
5011800	5017640	podcast hardware and software that i'm struggling to learn to use is a whole other thing but hopefully
5017720	5022280	will improve rapidly over the coming weeks and months if you're a new listener i'd encourage
5022280	5027160	you to go out and to listen to all of the david deutch content that is out there here's ted
5027160	5032200	talks and other interviews of course buy his books subscribe to my podcast here wherever
5032200	5036920	you're listening there is a youtube version as i say if you are on audio only which sometimes
5036920	5042840	has those pretty visuals subscribe to the neval podcast where we are exploring all the major
5042840	5049560	themes in the fabric of reality and the beginning of infinity and neval is broadening all that content
5049560	5058760	out into the realms of wealth wisdom and life and finally if you're so inclined go to www.bretthall.org
5058760	5063240	and follow the links there to support this podcast there are lots of great podcasts out there all
5063240	5069960	about science and philosophy and even thinking but i think here we have a small community uniquely
5069960	5077080	devoted to a particularly special kind of clear thinking about life informed by the best that
5077080	5082520	science and philosophy can teach us we'd like to grow so the ideas can reach into places where the
5082520	5088120	errors need correcting so i'll keep doing my bit until next time let me steal a line from neval
5088120	5101800	and say stay optimistic bye
5118120	5129800	do
