Processing Overview for Arthur Gleckler
============================
Checking Arthur Gleckler/Roger Corman, author of Corman Common Lisp (long-form talk).txt
1. The speaker has been using Lisp since the 90s, starting with Common Lisp.
2. He initially struggled with Clojure due to its immutability and lack of mutable variables but appreciated its functional paradigm and rich data structures.
3. Clojure's integration with Java and .NET is beneficial for interfacing with other systems, although it can be cumbersome at times.
4. The speaker has recently been exploring continuations in Clojure, which he hadn't used before due to perceived complexity and efficiency concerns.
5. He implemented a language called Fuzzy that uses Arden 2.9 for fuzzy logic and requires control flow mechanisms like backtracking or continuations.
6. Continuations can be challenging in Java VM or CLR environments because they require saving and restoring the stack, which these platforms do not natively support.
7. The speaker is considering alternative algorithms to handle his current problem with continuations but is open to suggestions from others.
8. He is grateful for the opportunity to share his experience with like-minded Lisp enthusiasts and hopes that the attendees have found the discussion valuable.
