00:00.000 --> 00:14.640
In the early morning hours over Gondwana, the air is calm and still, as the stars gradually

00:14.640 --> 00:18.520
fade away in the rapidly lightening sky.

00:18.520 --> 00:26.040
A few clouds high in the atmosphere catch a glimpse of the sunrise to come, reflecting

00:26.040 --> 00:34.480
the same pink that now grows through the sky's lower reaches.

00:34.480 --> 00:40.480
Suddenly and silently, without a warning or fanfare, a flaring brightness pierces the horizon,

00:40.480 --> 00:45.320
and the orb of the sun emerges shimmering, appearing improbably large reflected in the

00:45.320 --> 00:51.520
ocean's surface.

00:51.520 --> 00:57.760
The world turns, and as the sun's light washes over the eastern shore of Gondwana, the landscape

00:57.760 --> 01:02.000
of the stevanian world is transformed.

01:02.000 --> 01:07.280
Lands surfaces that were dimly lit by diffuse and hazy pre-dawn glow mere moments ago are

01:07.280 --> 01:13.360
now cast into sharp and eerie contrast as the sun's impossibly low angle projects elongated

01:13.360 --> 01:19.640
shadows from every hillside, bluff and living thing.

01:19.640 --> 01:26.600
Under this bizarre lighting, the reality of a 400 million-year-old terrestrial world

01:26.600 --> 01:29.320
is revealed.

01:29.320 --> 01:34.000
Gone are the days of the barren, lifeless supercontinent.

01:34.000 --> 01:45.000
This immense land surface is now covered from shore to shore with terrestrial life.

01:45.000 --> 01:57.800
And it is still early days for the organisms who have forsaken the safety of the ocean.

01:57.800 --> 02:04.120
Insects and worms inch, crawl and clamber, but none have yet taken to the skies.

02:04.120 --> 02:11.240
Plants, alien and strange to our eyes, only recognizable as such by their green coloration,

02:11.240 --> 02:16.680
spread haphazardly over the reddish soil.

02:16.680 --> 02:21.800
There are few of the leaves, stalks, seeds and roots that will come to characterize later

02:21.800 --> 02:25.000
vascular plants and trees.

02:25.000 --> 02:32.000
Instead, these early colonizers creep and extend, occasionally projecting a fragile,

02:32.000 --> 02:39.200
rubbery stem a few tens of centimeters above the earth.

02:39.200 --> 02:44.720
And under the low morning sun, the shadows of these plants are, like the primitive plants

02:44.720 --> 02:48.160
themselves, stunted.

02:48.160 --> 03:00.120
But occasionally, huge, slender shadows extend many meters across the rolling landscape.

03:00.120 --> 03:07.400
Immense, organic but otherwise featureless towers, the largest of which reaches eight

03:07.400 --> 03:16.120
meters in height and one meter across.

03:16.120 --> 03:21.680
In an early terrestrial world dominated by primitive plants no more than a meter high,

03:21.680 --> 03:32.840
these monumental columns are huge and bizarre.

03:32.840 --> 03:37.640
But they are not plants, neither have they been wrought by the might of the earth or

03:37.640 --> 03:42.240
the craft of any sentient life as we know it.

03:42.240 --> 03:50.400
They are fungi, unimaginably huge mushroom skyscrapers that dwarf all other life on the

03:50.400 --> 03:53.320
surface of the Devonian earth.

03:53.320 --> 04:02.280
It is strange enough to consider a fungus reaching such mammoth proportions today, but

04:02.280 --> 04:15.160
it is even more remarkable in the relatively young terrestrial niche.

04:15.160 --> 04:21.640
The first fossils of these mysterious organic structures, recovered from Gaspe Bay in Quebec,

04:21.640 --> 04:29.200
were described more than 160 years ago by Canadian geologist John William Dawson.

04:29.200 --> 04:33.840
As was not uncommon at the time, John Dawson was a creationist, believing that all living

04:33.840 --> 04:40.960
things bestowed upon the earth were of the great creators making, arguing vehemently

04:40.960 --> 04:46.400
against Charles Darwin's new and radical theory of evolution.

04:46.400 --> 04:53.640
It is perhaps not surprising then, when faced with these bizarre Devonian fossils, Dawson's

04:53.640 --> 04:59.440
explanation erred on the side of the familiar.

04:59.440 --> 05:07.160
They were, he claimed, the remains of partially rotten, giant conifers.

05:07.160 --> 05:17.280
And he named them proto-taxities, roughly translating as first U.

05:17.280 --> 05:21.760
But Dawson's supposedly rotten specimens weren't even the first proto-taxities fossils

05:21.760 --> 05:25.680
to be collected.

05:25.680 --> 05:31.400
Some 17 years earlier, one of Darwin's friends and colleagues, Joseph Hooker, recovered similar

05:31.400 --> 05:34.560
remnants from Devonian rocks in Scotland.

05:34.560 --> 05:44.760
Unfortunately, the samples being mislaid until 2012.

05:44.760 --> 05:49.880
In the intervening years, many other examples of proto-taxities were found, from terrestrial

05:49.880 --> 05:53.200
rocks all over the world.

05:53.200 --> 05:58.120
Now they can be found in abundance in deposits from the mid-Ordovician, 470 million years

05:58.120 --> 06:03.440
old, to the late Devonian aged 360 million years.

06:03.440 --> 06:08.320
These mysterious living monuments existed for 20 times the length of humanity's own

06:08.320 --> 06:10.880
reign.

06:10.880 --> 06:16.200
Given the immense diversity of fungi today, from slime molds, fungal infections to edible

06:16.200 --> 06:18.400
oyster mushrooms.

06:18.400 --> 06:24.520
The bizarre morphology of proto-taxities has attracted many alternative explanations.

06:24.520 --> 06:30.200
From that of a stringy alga, like seaweed, to a fortuitously rolled-up bundle of non-vascular

06:30.200 --> 06:32.360
plants like liverwort.

06:32.360 --> 06:38.920
But the scientific consensus of the 21st century is that these seemingly impossible structures

06:38.920 --> 06:44.360
are in fact members of a long overlooked but nevertheless omnipresent kingdom.

06:44.360 --> 06:48.880
The Fungi

06:48.880 --> 06:53.960
Prototaxity's large size and widespread habitat throughout the Devonian is a clear implication

06:53.960 --> 07:00.240
that they were successful, and likely owed that success to a long and prosperous evolutionary

07:00.240 --> 07:02.600
line.

07:02.600 --> 07:07.280
The humble Fungi, which lived our lives practically out of sight and without which many of our

07:07.280 --> 07:13.640
modern ecosystems would not be able to survive, have been lurking in the background for longer

07:13.640 --> 07:16.560
than we may imagine.

07:16.560 --> 07:23.880
So, as we rewind the evolutionary clock from this curious age when vast mushrooms towered

07:23.880 --> 07:34.000
over all life on Earth, how far must we go to find their beginnings?

07:34.000 --> 07:41.200
What were the first Fungi on the planet and how did they come to shape our modern world?

07:41.200 --> 07:47.720
The answer might just be more amazing than we could have possibly imagined.

07:47.720 --> 08:01.040
The implications stretching far into our future, as well as our past.

08:01.040 --> 08:05.720
The history of our world spans more than four billion years, that's a lot of ground

08:05.720 --> 08:07.080
to cover.

08:07.080 --> 08:12.600

09:02.720 --> 09:12.760
In the blue mountains of eastern Oregon, bright alpine lakes shine like gemstones amidst

09:12.760 --> 09:16.800
the mountain meadows.

09:16.800 --> 09:27.520
Marching pine forests stretch off into the distance.

09:27.520 --> 09:34.320
The Malur National Forest is a peaceful, natural wilderness, popular with hunters, herders

09:34.320 --> 09:37.440
and hikers alike.

09:37.440 --> 09:43.840
And yet, unlikely as it seems, this forest is home to the largest and one of the oldest

09:43.840 --> 09:53.040
living beings on Earth.

09:53.040 --> 09:56.720
Like the mythical Sasquatch, it hides from sight.

09:56.720 --> 10:01.160
This enigmatic organism can only be spotted at certain times of the year and then only

10:01.160 --> 10:04.040
if you know where to look.

10:04.040 --> 10:10.760
However, unlike Bigfoot, once glimpsed, this elusive entity is unable to make good its

10:10.760 --> 10:16.400
escape, since it is rooted, quite literally, beneath the ground.

10:23.320 --> 10:29.240
In 1998, a team of scientists set out to map the distribution of a deadly pathogenic fungus

10:29.240 --> 10:31.440
in eastern Oregon.

10:31.440 --> 10:36.480
In the moist autumns of the US Pacific coast, dark honey mushrooms sprout all around the

10:36.480 --> 10:44.000
bases of ailing pine trees.

10:44.000 --> 10:49.400
Named for the golden colour of their caps, they are certainly attractive specimens.

10:49.520 --> 10:56.720
They are a symptom of a much more sinister phenomenon unfolding beneath the surface.

10:56.720 --> 11:03.000
For the honey mushrooms are only the fruiting bodies of the armillaria fungus, which survives

11:03.000 --> 11:12.040
by infecting and attacking the roots and trunks of living trees.

11:12.040 --> 11:18.760
It is a parasite feared by foresters all over the world, and by the time its mushrooms emerge,

11:18.760 --> 11:24.600
it is typically too late for the luckless tree, which has been eaten away from the inside

11:24.600 --> 11:31.240
by the insinuating fungal fibres.

11:31.240 --> 11:35.000
In order to investigate the spread of this fungal parasite throughout the idyllic woodland

11:35.000 --> 11:41.080
of Malur, the scientists combined traditional, mycological techniques with the latest in

11:41.080 --> 11:44.920
20th century genetic fingerprinting.

11:45.000 --> 11:49.240
In the following samples of the fungal fibres from separate afflicted trees, they combined

11:49.240 --> 11:53.520
them in a petri dish to see if they would grow together and fuse, implying that they

11:53.520 --> 11:58.360
were of compatible genetic stock.

11:58.360 --> 12:04.120
And by extracting and analysing their DNA, the similarities and differences in their

12:04.120 --> 12:09.160
genes could be compared side by side.

12:09.160 --> 12:14.120
The results of this analysis were astounding.

12:14.120 --> 12:21.960
At every tree they sampled over a 10 square kilometre area, the armillaria fungus was genetically

12:21.960 --> 12:26.600
identical.

12:26.600 --> 12:31.960
Just as the cells in our own bodies are genetic clones of one another, so too were these fungal

12:31.960 --> 12:34.320
fibres.

12:34.320 --> 12:41.320
And just as our genetic makeup defines our individuality from other members of our species,

12:41.320 --> 12:49.320
so the fibres of armillaria were all part of one immense fungal individual.

12:53.320 --> 13:03.400
Here, just beneath the forest floor, was the largest individual organism on earth.

13:03.400 --> 13:08.480
Nicknamed the humongous fungus for good reason.

13:08.480 --> 13:20.040
Three metres beneath the surface, it extends over an area of some 2,384 acres.

13:20.040 --> 13:27.240
It dwarfs the largest living animal, the 33 metre long blue whale, and even trumps the

13:27.240 --> 13:37.880
largest plant colony, the 107 acre quaking aspen of Utah, named Pando.

13:37.880 --> 13:45.680
And yet this monstrous fungus could easily be missed, if not for its golden mushrooms

13:45.680 --> 13:52.760
and the dying trees it leaves in its wake.

13:52.760 --> 14:00.000
Because the immense body of armillaria is actually made of a network of gossamer fibres, which

14:00.000 --> 14:06.280
even at their densest look little more than white moldy fur.

14:06.280 --> 14:13.680
And yet this mycelial network, the true vegetative form of many fungi all over the world, is

14:13.680 --> 14:19.880
much greater than the sum of its diminutive parts.

14:19.880 --> 14:34.320
Not as an individual, per se, but a collective.

14:34.360 --> 14:43.480
The armillaria of eastern Oregon is not only remarkable in its size, but also its age.

14:43.480 --> 14:50.280
Based on its rate of growth, scientists estimate this humongous fungus to be at least 2,400

14:50.280 --> 14:59.120
years old, and possibly almost twice that.

14:59.240 --> 15:04.800
It has seen the rise and fall of civilisations and religions.

15:04.800 --> 15:15.440
The lives and deaths of almost 100 human generations.

15:15.440 --> 15:19.400
But this ancient organism is far from dormant.

15:19.400 --> 15:25.200
It, like all mycelia, is vibrantly alive, continually shifting and migrating through

15:25.200 --> 15:27.760
the forest soil.

15:27.760 --> 15:32.160
Much faster and stranger than the roots of a plant.

15:32.160 --> 15:40.480
For as we now know from roots discovered in 2017, mycelium itself seems to have been around

15:40.480 --> 15:50.560
for far longer, perhaps for more than 2 billion years, roughly half of Earth's history.

15:58.760 --> 16:04.440
The mycelial network stretching beneath the forest floor is composed of countless fungal

16:04.440 --> 16:11.520
fibres known as hyphae, each five times thinner than a human herb.

16:11.520 --> 16:17.280
But with the capacity to branch and fuse to create a woven mesh.

16:17.280 --> 16:22.840
This three-dimensional net can be so dense that a single teaspoon of mycelium can contain

16:22.840 --> 16:29.720
as much as 10 kilometres of ultrafine hyphae.

16:29.720 --> 16:34.040
Each fungal individual defines and expands its borders through the probing growth of

16:34.040 --> 16:40.760
hyphal tips, similar to the exploratory hairs of plants' roots and shoots, yet far more

16:40.760 --> 16:41.760
numerous.

16:41.760 --> 16:46.960
A large mycelial network may contain billions of hyphal tips whose exploration through the

16:46.960 --> 16:55.880
soil helps to locate food sources, grow and renew the fungal body.

16:55.880 --> 17:00.360
Hyphae may be small, but they are mighty.

17:00.360 --> 17:05.640
Despite being only one cell thick, they can nevertheless knit together to create solid

17:05.640 --> 17:10.440
three-dimensional structures.

17:10.440 --> 17:16.560
Like the golden edible mushroom caps of Armillaria, the rigid shelves of the polypore bracket

17:16.560 --> 17:27.080
fungus and even the towering columns of proto-taxities.

17:27.080 --> 17:32.120
There have been documented cases of newly surfaced roads being ripped open by the growth

17:32.120 --> 17:40.040
of mushrooms through the tarmac, and experiments have shown that growing hyphae can summon

17:40.040 --> 17:47.360
enough force to penetrate Kevlar.

17:47.360 --> 17:51.560
Of course the main purpose of these mycelial hyphae is not to pierce armour and ravage

17:51.560 --> 17:54.120
our infrastructure.

17:54.120 --> 17:58.160
When they're not assembling elaborate fruiting bodies, hyphae are primarily occupied with

17:58.160 --> 18:07.400
the all-consuming task of feeding the voracious fungal entity.

18:07.400 --> 18:12.520
Oozing digestive enzymes out into the space around them, they supervise the breakdown

18:12.520 --> 18:22.960
of organic matter, then reabsorb the products.

18:22.960 --> 18:27.120
But they are capable of much more than just devouring.

18:27.120 --> 18:34.160
The probing behaviour of millions of hyphal tips is like that of an immense swarm, acquiring

18:34.160 --> 18:41.120
and integrating information simultaneously on a massively parallel basis and on a scale

18:41.120 --> 18:54.280
that rivals most home computers.

18:54.280 --> 19:00.000
Recent experiments have proven that mycelium can navigate its way through mazes to find

19:00.000 --> 19:11.760
the quickest route to the end.

19:11.760 --> 19:17.680
Deciding whether to pursue or abandon a path of exploration relies on communication between

19:17.680 --> 19:25.840
distant reaches of the mycelial network.

19:25.840 --> 19:31.160
Although scientists are still unsure precisely how such communication takes place, they have

19:31.160 --> 19:38.200
observed it to be lightning fast, much faster for example than the chemical discourse of

19:38.200 --> 19:52.120
plants and perhaps more similar to the electrical signalling along our own nerve cells.

19:52.120 --> 19:56.480
As the hyphae grow, sever or reinforce their links dynamically based on the information

19:56.480 --> 20:10.360
they receive, the mycelial network on the whole may be likened to a brain.

20:10.360 --> 20:16.640
Are mycelial fungi therefore capable of decision making?

20:16.640 --> 20:21.040
Problem solving?

20:21.040 --> 20:28.580
Like octopi, lacking a conventional nervous system, yet seeming to think with their tentacles.

20:28.580 --> 20:32.880
Do they possess a spark of intelligence in that hyphal brain, a composition of many life

20:32.880 --> 20:38.320
forms coming together to create a larger, more formidable whole?

20:38.480 --> 20:49.280
If so, it is unlike any intelligence that we are accustomed to recognizing.

20:49.280 --> 20:54.560
And yet, it was Charles Darwin who wrote that intelligence is based on how efficient a species

20:54.560 --> 21:01.560
becomes at doing the things they need to survive.

21:01.560 --> 21:06.280
Given the monumental success of the giant armillaria and all other fungi whose bodies

21:06.280 --> 21:12.720
are composed of shifting, entwining hyphal nets, it's not hard to appreciate their efficiency,

21:12.720 --> 21:20.920
even if acknowledging intelligence is a step too far.

21:20.920 --> 21:26.120
Though bizarrely they do seem to exhibit traits of memory on occasion, without the need for

21:26.120 --> 21:32.440
a brain as we would recognize it, in truth we still know very little of fungi and their

21:32.440 --> 21:38.160
strange collective lives.

21:38.160 --> 21:43.280
By themselves mycelial networks are forced to be reckoned with, and yet their power to

21:43.280 --> 21:49.040
shape and transform a living ecosystem is even more formidable.

21:49.040 --> 21:54.160
The inexorable growth of hyphae and the enzyme cocktail they excrete is enough to shatter

21:54.160 --> 22:01.960
rock over and over, creating the first soils in a bare landscape, and then, through their

22:01.960 --> 22:07.160
dense organic net, holding the ground in place.

22:07.160 --> 22:14.680
It is fungi who help pave the way for modern plants and animals to colonize virgin ground,

22:14.680 --> 22:20.040
and it was likely fungi who helped plants to make the leap onto land in the first place,

22:20.040 --> 22:24.960
470 million years ago.

22:24.960 --> 22:29.280
For those first colonizing plants did not yet have the root systems that would allow

22:29.280 --> 22:36.440
them to access nutrients from the thin or division soil.

22:36.440 --> 22:43.160
And so, researchers think that mycelial networks stepped up and fulfilled that role, at least

22:43.160 --> 22:47.680
for a few tens of millions of years.

22:47.680 --> 22:54.800
A role they continue to be an integral part of in forests all over the world.

22:54.800 --> 23:01.000
In this way, it was fungi who have enabled, shaped and guided the course of terrestrial

23:01.000 --> 23:05.960
evolution.

23:05.960 --> 23:13.920
Fungi make mushrooms, but first, they have to unmake something else.

23:13.920 --> 23:19.360
In this great recycling of organic matter that keeps our world moving, keeps evolution ever

23:19.360 --> 23:24.360
pushing onwards, they are the main players.

23:24.360 --> 23:31.040
And yet, still now, despite decades of research, we still know so little about these creatures

23:31.040 --> 23:35.400
with whom we share, a common ancestor.

23:35.400 --> 23:40.720
Modern science is still delving deep to find out just how far these inscrutable fungal

23:40.720 --> 24:02.440
lives are entwined with our own, and with every other living thing on earth.

24:02.440 --> 24:09.800
In the year 1487, so says the Spanish friar Diego Durán, writing two generations later,

24:09.800 --> 24:18.240
a particularly significant occasion took place at the Mexico Aztec capital of Tenochtitlán,

24:18.240 --> 24:23.840
one of the largest cities the world had ever seen, the beating heart of the most powerful

24:23.840 --> 24:29.800
of all Mesoamerican empires.

24:29.800 --> 24:35.080
An early anthropologist of sorts, Durán sought to preserve the history of the rapidly disappearing

24:35.080 --> 24:37.580
Aztecs.

24:37.580 --> 24:43.800
By his day, subject to Christianity and harsh Spanish colonial rule, he did this by doing

24:43.800 --> 24:51.920
what many refused to do, by talking and engaging with the surviving elders, recording for posterity,

24:51.920 --> 24:54.120
what they told.

24:54.120 --> 25:03.760
On this particular occasion, in 1487, Durán records a particularly grisly event.

25:03.760 --> 25:07.800
The new emperor, Ahuid Sotl, one of the most formidable military leaders in the entire

25:07.800 --> 25:16.360
history of the new world, did things on a grand scale.

25:16.360 --> 25:22.000
Following his accession and successful conquests into new lands, over the course of four days,

25:22.240 --> 25:33.000
tens of thousands of captive warriors ascended the templo mayor at the heart of the city.

25:33.000 --> 25:38.580
One by one, their beating hearts were cut from their chests.

25:38.580 --> 25:47.920
Sacrificial blood offered to the gods as part of the ceremonial rededication of the empire.

25:48.000 --> 25:54.200
Yet for those not taking part in the orgy of human sacrifice, the extended coronation

25:54.200 --> 25:59.320
festival is cause for uninhibited celebration.

25:59.320 --> 26:06.200
Chocolate is drunk, songs are sung and a very special delicacy is enjoyed.

26:06.200 --> 26:12.120
Known locally as Teonana cattle, the flesh of the gods is a small spindly mushroom with

26:12.120 --> 26:17.880
a white stem and golden cap.

26:17.960 --> 26:26.600
Veterans eat it raw, all with a little honey, and are instantly transformed.

26:26.600 --> 26:30.760
Some find themselves laughing and dancing uncontrollably.

26:30.760 --> 26:38.920
Others experience strange and disturbing visions of war, demons, or even their own deaths.

26:38.920 --> 26:45.120
Some are overcome, weeping openly, while others take quietly to their houses in a meditative

26:45.120 --> 26:51.080
mood.

26:51.080 --> 27:00.040
And after these journeys and visions, they come together to discuss what they saw.

27:00.040 --> 27:06.640
They believe that the mushrooms were gifted to the Aztec people by this serpent god Quetzalcoatl,

27:06.640 --> 27:14.680
and that consuming them gives them the power to commune with their gods.

27:14.680 --> 27:20.560
They are a frequent component of celebrations, healing, and religious rituals.

27:20.560 --> 27:25.760
Whether Jurán or subsequent Spanish colonizers also sample the sacred mushrooms, we do not

27:25.760 --> 27:31.600
know, and later conquistadors made great efforts to erase all records of the mind-altering

27:31.600 --> 27:40.720
substances, as well as the culture of the pre-Columbian Americas.

27:40.720 --> 27:44.480
After the fall of the Aztec Empire, it was difficult to learn more about the supposedly

27:44.480 --> 27:52.000
psychedelic fungi, or even identify the individual mushrooms responsible.

27:52.000 --> 27:59.080
Their very existence became controversial.

27:59.080 --> 28:03.800
Was the flesh of the gods little more than a myth itself invented by a traumatized chronicler

28:03.800 --> 28:10.680
to distance from the horrors of human sacrifice?

28:11.640 --> 28:38.800
Now, of course, we know these transcendental fungi as magic mushrooms, containing a chemical

28:38.800 --> 28:43.840
compound called psilocybin that can produce a psychedelic trip and hallucinations like

28:43.840 --> 28:50.840
that of the drug LSD.

28:50.840 --> 28:54.920
In fact, LSD itself was first synthesized from the chemicals produced by a different

28:54.920 --> 29:01.880
kind of fungus, and there are many such mushrooms capable of inducing similar experiences.

29:09.280 --> 29:13.040
While Diego Durán might have been one of the first westerners to hear of the ritual

29:13.040 --> 29:24.480
consumption of these mushrooms, the 15th-century Aztecs were by no means the first partake.

29:24.480 --> 29:29.080
Ancient manuscripts that predate the Spanish conquest depict feathered deities holding

29:29.080 --> 29:34.800
and eating mushrooms, and mushroom-shaped statues have been discovered from Mesoamerica

29:34.800 --> 29:46.360
stretching back to the 2nd millennium BC.

29:46.360 --> 29:52.360
Elsewhere in the world, reverence for the spiritual mushroom extends back even further.

29:52.360 --> 29:58.520
Cave paintings in Algeria created between 7000 and 9000 BCE depict a godly figure with

29:58.520 --> 30:06.920
an animal's head and mushroom-like figures sprouting from its shoulders and arms.

30:06.920 --> 30:12.240
In Classical Greece, a secretive ceremonial meeting known as the Eleusinian Mysteries,

30:12.240 --> 30:17.720
frequented by the likes of Plato, has long been theorized to involve the use of the psychedelic

30:17.720 --> 30:25.160
ergot fungi.

30:25.160 --> 30:31.200
It is the kind of bizarre image that the straight-minded might find hard to interpret, but which makes

30:31.200 --> 30:38.600
ultimate sense to a psilocybin connoisseur.

30:38.600 --> 30:43.120
The deep, interlinked history of humans and psychedelic fungi has even given rise to a

30:43.120 --> 30:48.960
controversial theory, that it is the mushrooms themselves that are the architects of our

30:48.960 --> 30:52.960
humanity.

30:53.800 --> 30:57.720
Anthropologists have long grappled with the puzzling speed by which human culture, social

30:57.720 --> 31:04.160
structure, commerce and art seem to appear among the human species 50-70,000 years ago

31:04.160 --> 31:21.720
during the Paleolithic era.

31:21.720 --> 31:26.960
Scars on fossilized leaves from 48 million years ago indicative of infection by the Cordyceps

31:26.960 --> 31:33.120
fungus suggests fungi may have been manipulating minds for as long as there have been minds

31:33.120 --> 31:38.720
to manipulate.

31:38.720 --> 31:43.920
Witnessing the transformative effects of psilocybin on the human mind today, and the uncanny

31:43.920 --> 31:49.480
ability of certain fungi to influence their life forms around them, certain fringe scholars

31:49.480 --> 31:54.120
have suggested it was the hallucinogenic effects of these mushrooms that allowed our

31:54.120 --> 32:02.680
ancestors to expand their minds in the first place.

32:02.680 --> 32:07.640
This so-called stoned ape theory of human evolution certainly sits at the fringes of

32:07.640 --> 32:13.360
science, and with little tangible evidence from that time, unfortunately we may simply

32:13.360 --> 32:23.120
never know how much of our modern civilization we owe to the psychedelic trips of our forebears.

32:23.120 --> 32:29.440
But even if hallucinogenic mushrooms have played a marginal role, fungi in general have

32:29.440 --> 32:38.400
had a potent connection with humans for at least as long as there have been humans.

32:38.400 --> 32:43.080
Certain yeasts in particular that live on our bodies have adapted so much that they can't

32:43.320 --> 32:47.640
without us.

32:47.640 --> 32:52.200
Neanderthal remains have been found with traces of penicillin producing moulds ground into

32:52.200 --> 32:57.600
their teeth, thought to be a treatment for dental problems, in a practice similar to

32:57.600 --> 33:02.600
that known from indigenous Australians and ancient Egyptians.

33:02.600 --> 33:08.880
More recently, Otzi, the Iceman, the 5,000-year-old mummy found frozen in the ice of the Austro-Italian

33:08.880 --> 33:15.520
Alps, carried with him pieces of the polypore fungus, which he likely used as tinder for

33:15.520 --> 33:19.200
starting a fire.

33:19.200 --> 33:24.720
Ink caps were used by medieval chroniclers to record words on parchment, and untold

33:24.720 --> 33:30.120
amounts of edible mushrooms have been invaluable allies throughout history, despite being feared

33:30.120 --> 33:34.160
and shunned in many cultures.

33:35.120 --> 33:41.360
Eventually, penicillin would be rediscovered accidentally and isolated into a powerful

33:41.360 --> 33:51.840
antimicrobial medicine, just in time to turn the tide of the Second World War.

33:51.840 --> 33:59.000
Doubtless, we are at least part of our success as a species to the humble fungus.

33:59.000 --> 34:03.080
And humans are far from the only organisms that benefit from the diverse capabilities

34:03.080 --> 34:05.480
of the fungal kingdom.

34:05.480 --> 34:10.480
As has become better understood for the last decade or so, the mycelial networks that spread

34:10.480 --> 34:20.400
ubiquitously through forest floors all over the world do more than merely feed themselves.

34:20.400 --> 34:29.400
They also act as a vital communication network for the plants in the forest.

34:29.400 --> 34:34.360
It has been likened to a social network for the woodland, penetrating the roots of trees

34:34.360 --> 34:42.240
and weaving them together and providing vital nutrients that support their growth.

34:42.240 --> 34:47.240
Some scholars have gone so far as to liken this activity to trees talking to one another

34:47.240 --> 34:54.680
via underground fungal webs.

34:54.680 --> 34:59.440
Much more akin to cooperation, rather than competition.

34:59.440 --> 35:03.880
For this, wood-wide web is capable of so much more.

35:03.880 --> 35:09.600
It can transmit warnings between individual trees.

35:09.600 --> 35:13.920
If one comes under insect attack, the fungal network beneath the ground carries the warning

35:13.920 --> 35:22.480
to nearby vegetation, allowing them to mount a chemical defense before the threat arrives.

35:22.480 --> 35:27.080
And in a strange altruistic tendency, carbon is moved from areas of abundance to those

35:27.080 --> 35:29.520
of scarcity.

35:29.520 --> 35:39.880
This is biological cooperation or symbiosis on the scale of entire ecosystems.

35:39.880 --> 35:48.800
But fungi are also capable of collaborating on a much more individual and intimate level.

35:48.800 --> 35:54.120
Carbon are strange, plant-like growth that can be found on rocky surfaces, man-made monuments

35:54.120 --> 36:01.720
and even certain slow-moving animals.

36:01.720 --> 36:07.200
The crusted, scaly or feathered lifeforms are thought to encrust as much as 8% of the Earth's

36:07.200 --> 36:14.760
surface, often in places where no other living thing can survive.

36:14.760 --> 36:26.420
They can even withstand the freezing, desiccated and irradiated environment of space.

36:26.420 --> 36:31.000
But lichens are not actually a single organism.

36:31.000 --> 36:39.920
Rather they are an intimate symbiosis between photosynthesizing algae and fungus.

36:39.920 --> 36:46.800
Many different species of algae and fungi can come together and lichenize, the specific

36:46.800 --> 36:55.360
individuals determining the lichen's ultimate appearance and capabilities.

36:55.360 --> 37:00.320
Their relationship was actually one of the first symbioses to be described in the natural

37:00.320 --> 37:01.320
world.

37:01.320 --> 37:09.960
A Swiss botanist Simon Schrendener put forward his dual hypothesis of lichens in 1869.

37:09.960 --> 37:15.520
In this, he posited that the fungi were enslaving parasites that had forced the photosynthetic

37:15.520 --> 37:21.720
algae into service to reduce sugar and energy for them, albeit with the promise of harbour

37:21.720 --> 37:24.320
and nutrients in return.

37:24.320 --> 37:30.920
Today, however, we know the relationship between the two lichen partners to be much more equitable,

37:30.920 --> 37:38.760
although the deeper scientists probe, the more complex the picture becomes.

37:38.760 --> 37:45.320
In most lichens, there are more than two co-operating organisms, as several different fungal species

37:45.320 --> 37:50.920
work together in a way that mutually benefits all parties.

37:50.920 --> 37:59.880
Indeed, lichen scholars have yet to find how deep the symbiotic rabbit hole goes.

37:59.880 --> 38:04.800
Together with algae and lichens, with trees in the wood-wide web, or with humanity in

38:04.800 --> 38:14.720
modern civilisations, fungi have made themselves invaluable partners in many of Earth's ecosystems.

38:14.720 --> 38:19.360
Their integration and interaction with nearly every living thing on the planet ultimately

38:19.360 --> 38:26.400
blurs the line of where fungi end and everything else begins.

38:26.400 --> 38:34.200
A collection of organisms, not just master and slave, not just individual singers, but

38:34.200 --> 38:41.160
a song.

38:41.160 --> 38:48.640
And so, tracing the origins of these remarkable organisms requires that we first understand

38:48.640 --> 39:02.000
exactly what they are.

39:02.000 --> 39:06.440
Chernobyl, 1986

39:06.440 --> 39:12.240
A catastrophic explosion at a nuclear plant in what is now northern Ukraine sees radioactive

39:12.240 --> 39:17.320
waste spread across much of Europe.

39:17.320 --> 39:22.000
For many kilometres around the leaking plant, contamination levels are high enough to cause

39:22.000 --> 39:29.480
radiation poisoning and deadly cancers.

39:29.480 --> 39:34.480
Inarguably the worst nuclear disaster the world has ever seen, a 10 square kilometre area

39:34.480 --> 39:40.160
of the surrounding forest is killed outright by radioactive material amounting to 20 times

39:40.160 --> 39:48.840
that of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

39:48.840 --> 39:58.320
The region becomes known as the Red Forest, after the colour of its dead and dying trees.

39:58.320 --> 40:08.680
Every animal that couldn't flee ultimately perishing from the overwhelming corruption.

40:08.680 --> 40:14.240
After the disaster the Chernobyl plant itself was closed down, but the radioactive fuel

40:14.240 --> 40:17.800
it still contained was left in situ.

40:17.800 --> 40:22.280
In order to prevent any further reaction and to protect the immediate area from the effects

40:22.280 --> 40:30.600
of radiation, the fuel is stored in huge vats of water.

40:30.600 --> 40:37.920
The clear water itself glows with unearthly blue Cherenkov radiation, generated as the

40:37.920 --> 40:46.760
decaying fuel splits water molecules, releasing energy in the form of light.

40:46.760 --> 40:54.240
Only the water isn't clear anymore.

40:54.240 --> 40:59.960
Over the years it has become blackened.

40:59.960 --> 41:12.160
And the agent of this darkening is, remarkably, a fungus.

41:12.160 --> 41:16.440
Many species of fungi are known to be extremer files.

41:16.440 --> 41:20.440
They are able to tolerate conditions well beyond the limits of what we would consider

41:20.440 --> 41:23.840
a comfortable existence.

41:23.840 --> 41:30.600
Beyond such tolerance is the ability to withstand high levels of radioactivity.

41:30.600 --> 41:36.240
The same levels that were enough to ravage the planets and animals of the Red Forest.

41:36.240 --> 41:41.800
And so here, in the intensely radioactive waters of the abandoned Chernobyl plant, the

41:41.800 --> 41:48.120
radio-resistant fungi have found a way to survive.

41:48.120 --> 41:54.080
And more surprisingly, these hardy organisms seem to be doing more than merely surviving

41:54.080 --> 41:57.080
here.

41:57.080 --> 42:02.640
Scientists have found them growing towards the hot radioactive particles, and using the

42:02.640 --> 42:08.360
energy from radioactive decay in much the same way as plants use the light energy from

42:08.360 --> 42:12.320
the sun.

42:12.320 --> 42:20.520
Despite unimaginable dangers, these fungal organisms have found a way to feed on radioactivity,

42:20.520 --> 42:25.280
perhaps digging deep in their primordial genetic makeup to find a new niche in the wake of

42:25.280 --> 42:29.080
radioactive devastation.

42:29.080 --> 42:32.760
The discovery has staggering implications.

42:32.760 --> 42:38.520
If a mushroom can adapt to eat nuclear waste, then surely other waste products can be consumed

42:38.520 --> 42:49.960
too, perhaps most importantly, plastics.

42:49.960 --> 42:55.240
The remarkable colonisers of Chernobyl comprise just a single variety among a staggering diversity

42:55.240 --> 43:03.720
of fungal species, with seemingly endless adaptations to a wide range of habitats,

43:03.720 --> 43:08.000
lifestyles and symbiotic association.

43:08.000 --> 43:14.320
There are single-celled yeasts, vast mycorrhizal networks, fungi that build mushrooms of every

43:14.320 --> 43:19.960
conceivable shape and size, fungi that are cultured exclusively inside the nests of leaf

43:19.960 --> 43:28.480
cutarans, fungi that live only on and in the human body, and not to mention the countless

43:28.480 --> 43:37.440
lichenized forms hiding in plain sight.

43:37.440 --> 43:43.480
Although only 150,000 species have been formally described, scientists estimate there may be

43:43.480 --> 43:57.280
as many as 3.8 million species here on Earth, outnumbering plants by roughly 10 to 1.

43:57.280 --> 44:04.600
They have been incredibly successful, and are incredibly old, 500 million years at the

44:04.600 --> 44:06.360
very least.

44:06.360 --> 44:12.040
If close enough in evolution, mycelium from some fungi can blend seamlessly with other

44:12.040 --> 44:13.040
species.

44:13.040 --> 44:19.760
Of course, given this cross-species breeding and being, fungi are almost the very definition

44:19.760 --> 44:25.440
of other.

44:25.440 --> 44:34.440
The polyphonic way they experience the world is immensely different to our monophony.

44:34.440 --> 44:40.760
With so much diversity, it can become difficult to identify the features that unite fungi,

44:40.760 --> 44:44.600
rather than set them apart from one another.

44:44.600 --> 44:50.000
One mycological idea is that we should abandon dividing them into species altogether, due

44:50.000 --> 44:59.560
to the inadequate categorizations given to them for hundreds, if not thousands of years.

44:59.560 --> 45:05.080
Thought to be merely parasites until very recently, for influential Swedish botanist Carl

45:05.080 --> 45:09.360
Linnaeus, they were chaos incarnate.

45:09.360 --> 45:14.640
Others genuinely thought them caused by lightning strikes.

45:14.640 --> 45:19.520
By the 19th century, they were categorized as plants, and only in the mid-1960s were

45:19.520 --> 45:30.120
they granted an entire kingdom of their own, for in reality, fungi are closer to animals.

45:30.120 --> 45:34.800
They are eukaryotes, set apart from their bacterial cousins through the presence of a

45:34.800 --> 45:41.360
nucleus and other membrane-bound machinery inside their cells.

45:41.360 --> 45:46.120
They lack the photosynthetic chloroplasts that plants possess, and despite being historically

45:46.120 --> 45:51.040
grouped among plants on account of their vegetative lifestyle, fungi actually share

45:51.040 --> 45:54.320
more in common with animals than with any other kingdom.

45:54.320 --> 46:00.320
Indeed, many fungi contain the same light-sensitive pigments as can be found in our own eyes,

46:00.320 --> 46:04.720
and their compatible biochemistry is what makes them such potent allies in the field

46:04.720 --> 46:08.840
of human medicine.

46:08.840 --> 46:13.560
Together with animals and single-celled protists, the fungi are part of a larger group, known

46:13.560 --> 46:18.640
as epistakons, but justify their own kingdom through the possession of unique features shared

46:18.640 --> 46:24.680
by neither animal or protist.

46:24.680 --> 46:32.160
They are defined in part by their unique mode of growth, from probing hyphal tips, and the

46:32.160 --> 46:37.680
ability of these hyphae to digest their food outside the fungal body rather than an internal

46:37.680 --> 46:39.960
stomach.

46:39.960 --> 46:47.840
Typically, hyphae can be recognized by their ability to branch, often at right angles and

46:47.840 --> 46:53.720
to converge and fuse again further down the line.

46:53.720 --> 46:57.960
And fungal cells, regardless of their habitat, are all strengthened by a specific kind of

46:57.960 --> 47:02.480
biological polymer, known as chitin.

47:02.480 --> 47:06.080
Some animals also make use of chitin for protection.

47:06.080 --> 47:12.520
This is especially common in the ecosystems of arthropods like insects and crabs.

47:12.520 --> 47:18.160
But only in fungi is it ubiquitous around each and every cell.

47:18.160 --> 47:23.720
This toolkit of classifying features allows paleontologists to trace the fungal kingdom

47:23.720 --> 47:32.800
back through the mists of time, and to begin to search for the origins of fungi on Earth.

47:32.800 --> 47:38.160
That is the uniquely hyphal microstructure found in fossil specimens of proto-taxities

47:38.160 --> 47:43.840
that best supports its fungal interpretation.

47:43.840 --> 47:49.800
But an absence of corroborating biochemistry makes the conclusion of giant fungi 470 million

47:49.800 --> 47:53.160
years ago a somewhat tentative one.

47:53.160 --> 47:59.520
Instead, paleontologists consider the oldest uncontested fungal fossils to be those preserved

47:59.520 --> 48:07.240
in intricate cellular detail in the 410 million-year-old glassy shirts of Reiny, Scotland.

48:07.240 --> 48:14.600
Here, a wide diversity of fungal types are preserved as if in crystal-clear resin, painting

48:14.600 --> 48:20.480
a picture of a terrestrial Devonian world in which fungi have already found and exploited

48:20.480 --> 48:24.440
many of their modern-day niches.

48:24.440 --> 48:28.840
These specimens are by no means the first of their kind, appearing as they do already

48:28.840 --> 48:35.520
adapted to their chosen lifestyles.

48:35.520 --> 48:42.360
But they do serve an important purpose in modern paleontological analysis.

48:42.360 --> 48:47.320
Genetic and physiological analysis of fungi alive today allow them to be plotted onto an

48:47.320 --> 48:54.360
evolutionary family tree, with more recently derived species forming the most distant twigs

48:54.360 --> 49:02.880
and more ancestral forms branching closer to the root.

49:02.880 --> 49:07.120
Finding and plotting the fossil specimens onto this family tree helps to orient those

49:07.120 --> 49:14.800
relationships in time as well as in evolutionary space, and to calibrate estimates on the rate

49:14.800 --> 49:20.560
of fungal evolution on the basis of genetic transformation.

49:20.560 --> 49:26.080
Using these statistical tools, modern paleontologists have estimated that the origins of the fungal

49:26.080 --> 49:32.280
kingdom extend back long before the age of giant proto-taxities.

49:32.280 --> 49:41.520
Indeed, they suggest that we should be searching for the first fungi back in the Neo-proto-Rzoic

49:41.520 --> 49:50.400
between 1,750 million years ago, before even plants or animals have made a definitive appearance.

49:50.400 --> 50:01.720
Long before the green abundance of the Devonian, when the terrestrial earth was still a wasteland.

50:01.720 --> 50:08.560
With no soil to speak of, all nutrients trapped within rocks, it seems at least possible that

50:08.560 --> 50:13.900
algae and fungus made it onto the land together.

50:13.900 --> 50:19.840
Like the aftermath of Chernobyl and countless mass extinction events before, early pioneers

50:19.840 --> 50:41.360
leading the way for more life to follow.

50:41.360 --> 50:45.800
Just outside the thriving city of Mbunji Mai in the heart of the Democratic Republic of

50:45.800 --> 50:57.960
Congo, rolling tropical grasslands are pushed aside by the inexorable advance of industry.

50:57.960 --> 51:02.920
Ever since the discovery of diamonds here in 1909, the gentle hillsides have been torn

51:02.920 --> 51:08.400
open, exposing wounds of bright red soil and filling the rivers with the same blood red

51:08.400 --> 51:11.400
silt.

51:12.400 --> 51:18.720
Today, though one of the most troubled regions on the planet, the area supplies some 10%

51:18.720 --> 51:22.360
of the world's diamonds.

51:22.360 --> 51:27.760
Respecting geologists continue to search for more in the ancient rocks beneath the surface,

51:27.760 --> 51:32.520
there is no other material like it.

51:32.520 --> 51:38.320
In the absence of any great mountains or sharp rocky escarpments in this part of the country,

51:38.320 --> 51:42.920
geologists must actively drill down into the rocks beneath their feet.

51:42.920 --> 51:48.560
And one such drill core, not far from the bustle of the DRC's second city, has revealed

51:48.560 --> 51:55.200
hidden treasures, although not the kind that will bring economic geologists running.

51:55.200 --> 52:01.800
The Kanshi B-13 core penetrates limestone and shaley rocks that are neoproterozoic in

52:01.800 --> 52:08.440
age, and which were likely deposited in a warm perennial lake.

52:08.440 --> 52:16.720
Here, as in so many rocks of this age, paleontologists have found spherical microfossils that are

52:16.720 --> 52:22.040
thought to belong to primitive eukaryotic algae.

52:22.040 --> 52:30.280
But at a depth of more than 100 meters, the extracted core contains something else, something

52:30.280 --> 52:37.000
much more remarkable for the time.

52:37.000 --> 52:43.800
In a layer aged between 810 and 715 million years old, an international team of scientists

52:43.800 --> 52:49.640
have identified curious filamentous fossils preserved in three dimensions by crystalline

52:49.640 --> 52:54.880
limestone.

52:54.880 --> 53:00.440
Each filament is less than 10 microns, 100th of a millimetre across and up to a millimetre

53:00.440 --> 53:04.720
in length.

53:04.720 --> 53:12.120
But together they pack densely into an interconnected mesh of branching and fusing strands.

53:12.120 --> 53:22.640
In shape and arrangement alone, they are surprisingly similar to the hyphae of modern mycelial network.

53:22.640 --> 53:30.640
But at an age almost double that of the oldest confirmed fungi, it will take more than morphology

53:30.640 --> 53:36.400
to make a case for these supposed neoproterozoic fungi.

53:36.400 --> 53:43.000
Fortunately, these filaments are preserved in such a way that allow scientists to search

53:43.000 --> 53:48.800
for other strengthening strands of evidence to support the fungal conclusion.

53:48.800 --> 53:53.440
Using a technique called Raman spectroscopy, which uses laser light to reveal the nature

53:53.440 --> 53:59.000
of chemical bonds in a structure, they found the filaments to be composed of organic material

53:59.000 --> 54:06.440
that had undergone the same heating and compression as the surrounding rock.

54:06.440 --> 54:11.160
This implies that they are just as ancient as the limestone that surrounds them, and

54:11.160 --> 54:15.000
not the result of some secondary infiltration.

54:16.000 --> 54:20.240
Next, the researchers employed a kind of chemical straining that's typically used

54:20.240 --> 54:23.800
to identify fungi in modern soils.

54:23.800 --> 54:29.080
The stain clings to the chitin that uniquely makes up fungal cell walls and not to anything

54:29.080 --> 54:36.920
else, causing the fungal members of the community to glow green under specific microscopic light.

54:36.920 --> 54:42.400
And sure enough, when the fossil filaments were treated with the stain, they glowed the

54:42.400 --> 54:50.320
characteristic green, suggesting that chitin was a significant part of their original organic structure.

54:53.320 --> 54:59.040
These multiple lines of evidence from morphology to chemical composition are necessary to substantiate

54:59.040 --> 55:06.120
what is ultimately a remarkable claim, that recognizable fungal mycelia had already evolved

55:06.120 --> 55:12.960
at least 715 million years ago.

55:12.960 --> 55:17.680
This mycelium would have lived within the sediment, just under the water or at the shore of the

55:17.680 --> 55:25.600
neoprotozoic lake, feeding on decaying organic matter from algae and bacteria.

55:25.600 --> 55:31.640
It is a lifestyle almost identical to that of many mycelia today, and these fossils suggest

55:31.640 --> 55:40.280
it has an origin deeper in the past than we might imagine, but even these are not the

55:40.280 --> 55:46.000
oldest fungal candidates found to date.

55:46.000 --> 55:50.400
In the far north of the Canadian Northwest Territories, on the desolate frosted shores

55:50.400 --> 55:58.240
of the Arctic Ocean, dark-coloured shales have been dated to around 1 billion years old,

55:58.240 --> 56:05.360
around 2 or 300 million years older than the limestones of the DRC.

56:05.360 --> 56:12.040
Here, traditional micro paleontological methods, which involve dissolving away the solid rock

56:12.040 --> 56:17.200
to leave behind the organic material trapped within, has yielded micro fossils with a unique

56:17.200 --> 56:23.000
shape and structure that hints at a fungal affinity.

56:23.000 --> 56:27.080
Large spheres between 3 and 8 hundredths of a millimetre across are attached to narrow

56:27.080 --> 56:33.160
filaments which branch at right angles to one another.

56:33.160 --> 56:36.880
Researchers have interpreted these structures as the reproductive spores and connective

56:36.880 --> 56:41.960
hyphae of fungi.

56:41.960 --> 56:47.320
And while the wealth of analytical data is not as great as the younger African specimens,

56:47.320 --> 56:51.920
chemical analysis of these Canadian examples does seem to suggest the presence of fungal

56:51.920 --> 56:57.880
chitin within the walls as well.

56:57.880 --> 57:02.200
Although these conclusions are more tentative, the possible appearance of already distinct

57:02.200 --> 57:07.480
fungal structures at this earlier point in time does seem to be honing in on the earliest

57:07.480 --> 57:15.040
origins of the fungal kingdom.

57:15.040 --> 57:20.480
Elsewhere around the world, fossils reveal some of the earliest possible holozoans,

57:20.480 --> 57:23.920
their precursors to true animals.

57:23.920 --> 57:27.520
That the fossil evidence of fungi seems to be consistent with genetic estimates of their

57:27.520 --> 57:33.000
appearance too, helps to build a picture of microbial diversity at the very beginning

57:33.000 --> 57:39.560
of the neoproterozoic, perhaps due in part to the stability and worldwide strife of the

57:39.560 --> 57:42.560
boring billion.

57:42.560 --> 57:49.480
This then could be the age where our ancestors and the fungi went their separate ways, diverging

57:49.480 --> 57:55.880
on very different evolutionary paths.

57:55.880 --> 58:03.600
However, there is one more fungal fossil candidate, which seems to blow this neatly

58:03.600 --> 58:08.520
converging picture apart.

58:08.520 --> 58:14.440
In 2017, paleontologists from Sweden and Australia found structures inside the bubbles of ancient

58:14.440 --> 58:24.120
lava flows that also seem to show a curiously fungal habit.

58:24.120 --> 58:33.240
The key difference is that these samples from South Africa are 2.4 billion years old.

58:33.240 --> 58:37.080
Inside these basaltic bubbles, which form naturally as gases attempt to escape through

58:37.080 --> 58:42.880
sticky liquid magma, the researchers have found filaments, the typical dimensions of

58:42.880 --> 58:51.040
fungal hyphae, which branch and fuse in a compellingly mycelial way.

58:51.040 --> 58:55.800
The morphology argument may be strong, but the unique preservation and extreme antiquity

58:55.800 --> 59:04.400
of these specimens renders any supporting chemical analysis impossible.

59:04.400 --> 59:08.400
And at more than a billion years older than when the fungal genome is thought to have

59:09.400 --> 59:14.920
The fungal interpretation is perhaps too extraordinary a claim.

59:14.920 --> 59:19.880
Yet even if they are not true fungi as we have come to define them, there is no denying

59:19.880 --> 59:25.280
the mycelial habit.

59:25.280 --> 59:30.520
Perhaps more primitive organisms, whether bacteria or some of the first eukaryotes,

59:30.520 --> 59:37.320
experimented with a mesh-like mycelium long before the fungal kingdom made it their own.

59:37.400 --> 59:43.640
All of these ancient fungal and mycelial discoveries have been made within the last 5 years, highlighting

59:43.640 --> 59:51.160
just how immature the science of fungal paleontology is, much like mycology in general, which hovers

59:51.160 --> 59:55.040
awkwardly somewhere between plant and animal studies.

59:55.040 --> 01:00:00.920
Indeed, it is only in the last few decades that ecologists have come to realize the staggering

01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:06.840
diversity and vital importance of fungi in modern ecosystems.

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:11.200
Catching glimpses of them within the fossil record, whether in their monumental success

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:17.400
as Devonian proto-taxities, their understated diversity in the rhiney-chert, or in their

01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:25.240
earliest microbial manifestations in the neoprotozoic, reveals just how influential fungi have been

01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:28.840
through much of life's history.

01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:33.760
They have played a crucial role in cycling nutrients and shaping ecosystems for much

01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:36.680
longer than we may have imagined.

01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:41.920
Perhaps creating soil in the first place, and certainly keeping it healthy for other

01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:44.680
forms of life.

01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:49.760
It is very likely that it was fungi that supported and enabled the success of other kingdoms

01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:56.520
of life throughout the neoprotozoic and beyond, just as it was fungi who facilitated the colonization

01:00:56.520 --> 01:01:00.520
of land some 450 million years ago.

01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:09.520
As well as the re-colonization of blasted landscapes after mass extinction events.

01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:20.520
For as much as a billion years or more, it seems, everywhere life seeks to explore,

01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:26.520
fungi have been one step ahead, preparing the way.

01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:38.520
And with the development of so-called mycotechture, being investigated for space travel and habitation,

01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:43.520
it is a role that may just continue long into the future.

01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:50.520
