0	14640	In the early morning hours over Gondwana, the air is calm and still, as the stars gradually
14640	18520	fade away in the rapidly lightening sky.
18520	26040	A few clouds high in the atmosphere catch a glimpse of the sunrise to come, reflecting
26040	34480	the same pink that now grows through the sky's lower reaches.
34480	40480	Suddenly and silently, without a warning or fanfare, a flaring brightness pierces the horizon,
40480	45320	and the orb of the sun emerges shimmering, appearing improbably large reflected in the
45320	51520	ocean's surface.
51520	57760	The world turns, and as the sun's light washes over the eastern shore of Gondwana, the landscape
57760	62000	of the stevanian world is transformed.
62000	67280	Lands surfaces that were dimly lit by diffuse and hazy pre-dawn glow mere moments ago are
67280	73360	now cast into sharp and eerie contrast as the sun's impossibly low angle projects elongated
73360	79640	shadows from every hillside, bluff and living thing.
79640	86600	Under this bizarre lighting, the reality of a 400 million-year-old terrestrial world
86600	89320	is revealed.
89320	94000	Gone are the days of the barren, lifeless supercontinent.
94000	105000	This immense land surface is now covered from shore to shore with terrestrial life.
105000	117800	And it is still early days for the organisms who have forsaken the safety of the ocean.
117800	124120	Insects and worms inch, crawl and clamber, but none have yet taken to the skies.
124120	131240	Plants, alien and strange to our eyes, only recognizable as such by their green coloration,
131240	136680	spread haphazardly over the reddish soil.
136680	141800	There are few of the leaves, stalks, seeds and roots that will come to characterize later
141800	145000	vascular plants and trees.
145000	152000	Instead, these early colonizers creep and extend, occasionally projecting a fragile,
152000	159200	rubbery stem a few tens of centimeters above the earth.
159200	164720	And under the low morning sun, the shadows of these plants are, like the primitive plants
164720	168160	themselves, stunted.
168160	180120	But occasionally, huge, slender shadows extend many meters across the rolling landscape.
180120	187400	Immense, organic but otherwise featureless towers, the largest of which reaches eight
187400	196120	meters in height and one meter across.
196120	201680	In an early terrestrial world dominated by primitive plants no more than a meter high,
201680	212840	these monumental columns are huge and bizarre.
212840	217640	But they are not plants, neither have they been wrought by the might of the earth or
217640	222240	the craft of any sentient life as we know it.
222240	230400	They are fungi, unimaginably huge mushroom skyscrapers that dwarf all other life on the
230400	233320	surface of the Devonian earth.
233320	242280	It is strange enough to consider a fungus reaching such mammoth proportions today, but
242280	255160	it is even more remarkable in the relatively young terrestrial niche.
255160	261640	The first fossils of these mysterious organic structures, recovered from Gaspe Bay in Quebec,
261640	269200	were described more than 160 years ago by Canadian geologist John William Dawson.
269200	273840	As was not uncommon at the time, John Dawson was a creationist, believing that all living
273840	280960	things bestowed upon the earth were of the great creators making, arguing vehemently
280960	286400	against Charles Darwin's new and radical theory of evolution.
286400	293640	It is perhaps not surprising then, when faced with these bizarre Devonian fossils, Dawson's
293640	299440	explanation erred on the side of the familiar.
299440	307160	They were, he claimed, the remains of partially rotten, giant conifers.
307160	317280	And he named them proto-taxities, roughly translating as first U.
317280	321760	But Dawson's supposedly rotten specimens weren't even the first proto-taxities fossils
321760	325680	to be collected.
325680	331400	Some 17 years earlier, one of Darwin's friends and colleagues, Joseph Hooker, recovered similar
331400	334560	remnants from Devonian rocks in Scotland.
334560	344760	Unfortunately, the samples being mislaid until 2012.
344760	349880	In the intervening years, many other examples of proto-taxities were found, from terrestrial
349880	353200	rocks all over the world.
353200	358120	Now they can be found in abundance in deposits from the mid-Ordovician, 470 million years
358120	363440	old, to the late Devonian aged 360 million years.
363440	368320	These mysterious living monuments existed for 20 times the length of humanity's own
368320	370880	reign.
370880	376200	Given the immense diversity of fungi today, from slime molds, fungal infections to edible
376200	378400	oyster mushrooms.
378400	384520	The bizarre morphology of proto-taxities has attracted many alternative explanations.
384520	390200	From that of a stringy alga, like seaweed, to a fortuitously rolled-up bundle of non-vascular
390200	392360	plants like liverwort.
392360	398920	But the scientific consensus of the 21st century is that these seemingly impossible structures
398920	404360	are in fact members of a long overlooked but nevertheless omnipresent kingdom.
404360	408880	The Fungi
408880	413960	Prototaxity's large size and widespread habitat throughout the Devonian is a clear implication
413960	420240	that they were successful, and likely owed that success to a long and prosperous evolutionary
420240	422600	line.
422600	427280	The humble Fungi, which lived our lives practically out of sight and without which many of our
427280	433640	modern ecosystems would not be able to survive, have been lurking in the background for longer
433640	436560	than we may imagine.
436560	443880	So, as we rewind the evolutionary clock from this curious age when vast mushrooms towered
443880	454000	over all life on Earth, how far must we go to find their beginnings?
454000	461200	What were the first Fungi on the planet and how did they come to shape our modern world?
461200	467720	The answer might just be more amazing than we could have possibly imagined.
467720	481040	The implications stretching far into our future, as well as our past.
481040	485720	The history of our world spans more than four billion years, that's a lot of ground
485720	487080	to cover.

542720	552760	In the blue mountains of eastern Oregon, bright alpine lakes shine like gemstones amidst
552760	556800	the mountain meadows.
556800	567520	Marching pine forests stretch off into the distance.
567520	574320	The Malur National Forest is a peaceful, natural wilderness, popular with hunters, herders
574320	577440	and hikers alike.
577440	583840	And yet, unlikely as it seems, this forest is home to the largest and one of the oldest
583840	593040	living beings on Earth.
593040	596720	Like the mythical Sasquatch, it hides from sight.
596720	601160	This enigmatic organism can only be spotted at certain times of the year and then only
601160	604040	if you know where to look.
604040	610760	However, unlike Bigfoot, once glimpsed, this elusive entity is unable to make good its
610760	616400	escape, since it is rooted, quite literally, beneath the ground.
623320	629240	In 1998, a team of scientists set out to map the distribution of a deadly pathogenic fungus
629240	631440	in eastern Oregon.
631440	636480	In the moist autumns of the US Pacific coast, dark honey mushrooms sprout all around the
636480	644000	bases of ailing pine trees.
644000	649400	Named for the golden colour of their caps, they are certainly attractive specimens.
649520	656720	They are a symptom of a much more sinister phenomenon unfolding beneath the surface.
656720	663000	For the honey mushrooms are only the fruiting bodies of the armillaria fungus, which survives
663000	672040	by infecting and attacking the roots and trunks of living trees.
672040	678760	It is a parasite feared by foresters all over the world, and by the time its mushrooms emerge,
678760	684600	it is typically too late for the luckless tree, which has been eaten away from the inside
684600	691240	by the insinuating fungal fibres.
691240	695000	In order to investigate the spread of this fungal parasite throughout the idyllic woodland
695000	701080	of Malur, the scientists combined traditional, mycological techniques with the latest in
701080	704920	20th century genetic fingerprinting.
705000	709240	In the following samples of the fungal fibres from separate afflicted trees, they combined
709240	713520	them in a petri dish to see if they would grow together and fuse, implying that they
713520	718360	were of compatible genetic stock.
718360	724120	And by extracting and analysing their DNA, the similarities and differences in their
724120	729160	genes could be compared side by side.
729160	734120	The results of this analysis were astounding.
734120	741960	At every tree they sampled over a 10 square kilometre area, the armillaria fungus was genetically
741960	746600	identical.
746600	751960	Just as the cells in our own bodies are genetic clones of one another, so too were these fungal
751960	754320	fibres.
754320	761320	And just as our genetic makeup defines our individuality from other members of our species,
761320	769320	so the fibres of armillaria were all part of one immense fungal individual.
773320	783400	Here, just beneath the forest floor, was the largest individual organism on earth.
783400	788480	Nicknamed the humongous fungus for good reason.
788480	800040	Three metres beneath the surface, it extends over an area of some 2,384 acres.
800040	807240	It dwarfs the largest living animal, the 33 metre long blue whale, and even trumps the
807240	817880	largest plant colony, the 107 acre quaking aspen of Utah, named Pando.
817880	825680	And yet this monstrous fungus could easily be missed, if not for its golden mushrooms
825680	832760	and the dying trees it leaves in its wake.
832760	840000	Because the immense body of armillaria is actually made of a network of gossamer fibres, which
840000	846280	even at their densest look little more than white moldy fur.
846280	853680	And yet this mycelial network, the true vegetative form of many fungi all over the world, is
853680	859880	much greater than the sum of its diminutive parts.
859880	874320	Not as an individual, per se, but a collective.
874360	883480	The armillaria of eastern Oregon is not only remarkable in its size, but also its age.
883480	890280	Based on its rate of growth, scientists estimate this humongous fungus to be at least 2,400
890280	899120	years old, and possibly almost twice that.
899240	904800	It has seen the rise and fall of civilisations and religions.
904800	915440	The lives and deaths of almost 100 human generations.
915440	919400	But this ancient organism is far from dormant.
919400	925200	It, like all mycelia, is vibrantly alive, continually shifting and migrating through
925200	927760	the forest soil.
927760	932160	Much faster and stranger than the roots of a plant.
932160	940480	For as we now know from roots discovered in 2017, mycelium itself seems to have been around
940480	950560	for far longer, perhaps for more than 2 billion years, roughly half of Earth's history.
958760	964440	The mycelial network stretching beneath the forest floor is composed of countless fungal
964440	971520	fibres known as hyphae, each five times thinner than a human herb.
971520	977280	But with the capacity to branch and fuse to create a woven mesh.
977280	982840	This three-dimensional net can be so dense that a single teaspoon of mycelium can contain
982840	989720	as much as 10 kilometres of ultrafine hyphae.
989720	994040	Each fungal individual defines and expands its borders through the probing growth of
994040	1000760	hyphal tips, similar to the exploratory hairs of plants' roots and shoots, yet far more
1000760	1001760	numerous.
1001760	1006960	A large mycelial network may contain billions of hyphal tips whose exploration through the
1006960	1015880	soil helps to locate food sources, grow and renew the fungal body.
1015880	1020360	Hyphae may be small, but they are mighty.
1020360	1025640	Despite being only one cell thick, they can nevertheless knit together to create solid
1025640	1030440	three-dimensional structures.
1030440	1036560	Like the golden edible mushroom caps of Armillaria, the rigid shelves of the polypore bracket
1036560	1047080	fungus and even the towering columns of proto-taxities.
1047080	1052120	There have been documented cases of newly surfaced roads being ripped open by the growth
1052120	1060040	of mushrooms through the tarmac, and experiments have shown that growing hyphae can summon
1060040	1067360	enough force to penetrate Kevlar.
1067360	1071560	Of course the main purpose of these mycelial hyphae is not to pierce armour and ravage
1071560	1074120	our infrastructure.
1074120	1078160	When they're not assembling elaborate fruiting bodies, hyphae are primarily occupied with
1078160	1087400	the all-consuming task of feeding the voracious fungal entity.
1087400	1092520	Oozing digestive enzymes out into the space around them, they supervise the breakdown
1092520	1102960	of organic matter, then reabsorb the products.
1102960	1107120	But they are capable of much more than just devouring.
1107120	1114160	The probing behaviour of millions of hyphal tips is like that of an immense swarm, acquiring
1114160	1121120	and integrating information simultaneously on a massively parallel basis and on a scale
1121120	1134280	that rivals most home computers.
1134280	1140000	Recent experiments have proven that mycelium can navigate its way through mazes to find
1140000	1151760	the quickest route to the end.
1151760	1157680	Deciding whether to pursue or abandon a path of exploration relies on communication between
1157680	1165840	distant reaches of the mycelial network.
1165840	1171160	Although scientists are still unsure precisely how such communication takes place, they have
1171160	1178200	observed it to be lightning fast, much faster for example than the chemical discourse of
1178200	1192120	plants and perhaps more similar to the electrical signalling along our own nerve cells.
1192120	1196480	As the hyphae grow, sever or reinforce their links dynamically based on the information
1196480	1210360	they receive, the mycelial network on the whole may be likened to a brain.
1210360	1216640	Are mycelial fungi therefore capable of decision making?
1216640	1221040	Problem solving?
1221040	1228580	Like octopi, lacking a conventional nervous system, yet seeming to think with their tentacles.
1228580	1232880	Do they possess a spark of intelligence in that hyphal brain, a composition of many life
1232880	1238320	forms coming together to create a larger, more formidable whole?
1238480	1249280	If so, it is unlike any intelligence that we are accustomed to recognizing.
1249280	1254560	And yet, it was Charles Darwin who wrote that intelligence is based on how efficient a species
1254560	1261560	becomes at doing the things they need to survive.
1261560	1266280	Given the monumental success of the giant armillaria and all other fungi whose bodies
1266280	1272720	are composed of shifting, entwining hyphal nets, it's not hard to appreciate their efficiency,
1272720	1280920	even if acknowledging intelligence is a step too far.
1280920	1286120	Though bizarrely they do seem to exhibit traits of memory on occasion, without the need for
1286120	1292440	a brain as we would recognize it, in truth we still know very little of fungi and their
1292440	1298160	strange collective lives.
1298160	1303280	By themselves mycelial networks are forced to be reckoned with, and yet their power to
1303280	1309040	shape and transform a living ecosystem is even more formidable.
1309040	1314160	The inexorable growth of hyphae and the enzyme cocktail they excrete is enough to shatter
1314160	1321960	rock over and over, creating the first soils in a bare landscape, and then, through their
1321960	1327160	dense organic net, holding the ground in place.
1327160	1334680	It is fungi who help pave the way for modern plants and animals to colonize virgin ground,
1334680	1340040	and it was likely fungi who helped plants to make the leap onto land in the first place,
1340040	1344960	470 million years ago.
1344960	1349280	For those first colonizing plants did not yet have the root systems that would allow
1349280	1356440	them to access nutrients from the thin or division soil.
1356440	1363160	And so, researchers think that mycelial networks stepped up and fulfilled that role, at least
1363160	1367680	for a few tens of millions of years.
1367680	1374800	A role they continue to be an integral part of in forests all over the world.
1374800	1381000	In this way, it was fungi who have enabled, shaped and guided the course of terrestrial
1381000	1385960	evolution.
1385960	1393920	Fungi make mushrooms, but first, they have to unmake something else.
1393920	1399360	In this great recycling of organic matter that keeps our world moving, keeps evolution ever
1399360	1404360	pushing onwards, they are the main players.
1404360	1411040	And yet, still now, despite decades of research, we still know so little about these creatures
1411040	1415400	with whom we share, a common ancestor.
1415400	1420720	Modern science is still delving deep to find out just how far these inscrutable fungal
1420720	1442440	lives are entwined with our own, and with every other living thing on earth.
1442440	1449800	In the year 1487, so says the Spanish friar Diego Durán, writing two generations later,
1449800	1458240	a particularly significant occasion took place at the Mexico Aztec capital of Tenochtitlán,
1458240	1463840	one of the largest cities the world had ever seen, the beating heart of the most powerful
1463840	1469800	of all Mesoamerican empires.
1469800	1475080	An early anthropologist of sorts, Durán sought to preserve the history of the rapidly disappearing
1475080	1477580	Aztecs.
1477580	1483800	By his day, subject to Christianity and harsh Spanish colonial rule, he did this by doing
1483800	1491920	what many refused to do, by talking and engaging with the surviving elders, recording for posterity,
1491920	1494120	what they told.
1494120	1503760	On this particular occasion, in 1487, Durán records a particularly grisly event.
1503760	1507800	The new emperor, Ahuid Sotl, one of the most formidable military leaders in the entire
1507800	1516360	history of the new world, did things on a grand scale.
1516360	1522000	Following his accession and successful conquests into new lands, over the course of four days,
1522240	1533000	tens of thousands of captive warriors ascended the templo mayor at the heart of the city.
1533000	1538580	One by one, their beating hearts were cut from their chests.
1538580	1547920	Sacrificial blood offered to the gods as part of the ceremonial rededication of the empire.
1548000	1554200	Yet for those not taking part in the orgy of human sacrifice, the extended coronation
1554200	1559320	festival is cause for uninhibited celebration.
1559320	1566200	Chocolate is drunk, songs are sung and a very special delicacy is enjoyed.
1566200	1572120	Known locally as Teonana cattle, the flesh of the gods is a small spindly mushroom with
1572120	1577880	a white stem and golden cap.
1577960	1586600	Veterans eat it raw, all with a little honey, and are instantly transformed.
1586600	1590760	Some find themselves laughing and dancing uncontrollably.
1590760	1598920	Others experience strange and disturbing visions of war, demons, or even their own deaths.
1598920	1605120	Some are overcome, weeping openly, while others take quietly to their houses in a meditative
1605120	1611080	mood.
1611080	1620040	And after these journeys and visions, they come together to discuss what they saw.
1620040	1626640	They believe that the mushrooms were gifted to the Aztec people by this serpent god Quetzalcoatl,
1626640	1634680	and that consuming them gives them the power to commune with their gods.
1634680	1640560	They are a frequent component of celebrations, healing, and religious rituals.
1640560	1645760	Whether Jurán or subsequent Spanish colonizers also sample the sacred mushrooms, we do not
1645760	1651600	know, and later conquistadors made great efforts to erase all records of the mind-altering
1651600	1660720	substances, as well as the culture of the pre-Columbian Americas.
1660720	1664480	After the fall of the Aztec Empire, it was difficult to learn more about the supposedly
1664480	1672000	psychedelic fungi, or even identify the individual mushrooms responsible.
1672000	1679080	Their very existence became controversial.
1679080	1683800	Was the flesh of the gods little more than a myth itself invented by a traumatized chronicler
1683800	1690680	to distance from the horrors of human sacrifice?
1691640	1718800	Now, of course, we know these transcendental fungi as magic mushrooms, containing a chemical
1718800	1723840	compound called psilocybin that can produce a psychedelic trip and hallucinations like
1723840	1730840	that of the drug LSD.
1730840	1734920	In fact, LSD itself was first synthesized from the chemicals produced by a different
1734920	1741880	kind of fungus, and there are many such mushrooms capable of inducing similar experiences.
1749280	1753040	While Diego Durán might have been one of the first westerners to hear of the ritual
1753040	1764480	consumption of these mushrooms, the 15th-century Aztecs were by no means the first partake.
1764480	1769080	Ancient manuscripts that predate the Spanish conquest depict feathered deities holding
1769080	1774800	and eating mushrooms, and mushroom-shaped statues have been discovered from Mesoamerica
1774800	1786360	stretching back to the 2nd millennium BC.
1786360	1792360	Elsewhere in the world, reverence for the spiritual mushroom extends back even further.
1792360	1798520	Cave paintings in Algeria created between 7000 and 9000 BCE depict a godly figure with
1798520	1806920	an animal's head and mushroom-like figures sprouting from its shoulders and arms.
1806920	1812240	In Classical Greece, a secretive ceremonial meeting known as the Eleusinian Mysteries,
1812240	1817720	frequented by the likes of Plato, has long been theorized to involve the use of the psychedelic
1817720	1825160	ergot fungi.
1825160	1831200	It is the kind of bizarre image that the straight-minded might find hard to interpret, but which makes
1831200	1838600	ultimate sense to a psilocybin connoisseur.
1838600	1843120	The deep, interlinked history of humans and psychedelic fungi has even given rise to a
1843120	1848960	controversial theory, that it is the mushrooms themselves that are the architects of our
1848960	1852960	humanity.
1853800	1857720	Anthropologists have long grappled with the puzzling speed by which human culture, social
1857720	1864160	structure, commerce and art seem to appear among the human species 50-70,000 years ago
1864160	1881720	during the Paleolithic era.
1881720	1886960	Scars on fossilized leaves from 48 million years ago indicative of infection by the Cordyceps
1886960	1893120	fungus suggests fungi may have been manipulating minds for as long as there have been minds
1893120	1898720	to manipulate.
1898720	1903920	Witnessing the transformative effects of psilocybin on the human mind today, and the uncanny
1903920	1909480	ability of certain fungi to influence their life forms around them, certain fringe scholars
1909480	1914120	have suggested it was the hallucinogenic effects of these mushrooms that allowed our
1914120	1922680	ancestors to expand their minds in the first place.
1922680	1927640	This so-called stoned ape theory of human evolution certainly sits at the fringes of
1927640	1933360	science, and with little tangible evidence from that time, unfortunately we may simply
1933360	1943120	never know how much of our modern civilization we owe to the psychedelic trips of our forebears.
1943120	1949440	But even if hallucinogenic mushrooms have played a marginal role, fungi in general have
1949440	1958400	had a potent connection with humans for at least as long as there have been humans.
1958400	1963080	Certain yeasts in particular that live on our bodies have adapted so much that they can't
1963320	1967640	without us.
1967640	1972200	Neanderthal remains have been found with traces of penicillin producing moulds ground into
1972200	1977600	their teeth, thought to be a treatment for dental problems, in a practice similar to
1977600	1982600	that known from indigenous Australians and ancient Egyptians.
1982600	1988880	More recently, Otzi, the Iceman, the 5,000-year-old mummy found frozen in the ice of the Austro-Italian
1988880	1995520	Alps, carried with him pieces of the polypore fungus, which he likely used as tinder for
1995520	1999200	starting a fire.
1999200	2004720	Ink caps were used by medieval chroniclers to record words on parchment, and untold
2004720	2010120	amounts of edible mushrooms have been invaluable allies throughout history, despite being feared
2010120	2014160	and shunned in many cultures.
2015120	2021360	Eventually, penicillin would be rediscovered accidentally and isolated into a powerful
2021360	2031840	antimicrobial medicine, just in time to turn the tide of the Second World War.
2031840	2039000	Doubtless, we are at least part of our success as a species to the humble fungus.
2039000	2043080	And humans are far from the only organisms that benefit from the diverse capabilities
2043080	2045480	of the fungal kingdom.
2045480	2050480	As has become better understood for the last decade or so, the mycelial networks that spread
2050480	2060400	ubiquitously through forest floors all over the world do more than merely feed themselves.
2060400	2069400	They also act as a vital communication network for the plants in the forest.
2069400	2074360	It has been likened to a social network for the woodland, penetrating the roots of trees
2074360	2082240	and weaving them together and providing vital nutrients that support their growth.
2082240	2087240	Some scholars have gone so far as to liken this activity to trees talking to one another
2087240	2094680	via underground fungal webs.
2094680	2099440	Much more akin to cooperation, rather than competition.
2099440	2103880	For this, wood-wide web is capable of so much more.
2103880	2109600	It can transmit warnings between individual trees.
2109600	2113920	If one comes under insect attack, the fungal network beneath the ground carries the warning
2113920	2122480	to nearby vegetation, allowing them to mount a chemical defense before the threat arrives.
2122480	2127080	And in a strange altruistic tendency, carbon is moved from areas of abundance to those
2127080	2129520	of scarcity.
2129520	2139880	This is biological cooperation or symbiosis on the scale of entire ecosystems.
2139880	2148800	But fungi are also capable of collaborating on a much more individual and intimate level.
2148800	2154120	Carbon are strange, plant-like growth that can be found on rocky surfaces, man-made monuments
2154120	2161720	and even certain slow-moving animals.
2161720	2167200	The crusted, scaly or feathered lifeforms are thought to encrust as much as 8% of the Earth's
2167200	2174760	surface, often in places where no other living thing can survive.
2174760	2186420	They can even withstand the freezing, desiccated and irradiated environment of space.
2186420	2191000	But lichens are not actually a single organism.
2191000	2199920	Rather they are an intimate symbiosis between photosynthesizing algae and fungus.
2199920	2206800	Many different species of algae and fungi can come together and lichenize, the specific
2206800	2215360	individuals determining the lichen's ultimate appearance and capabilities.
2215360	2220320	Their relationship was actually one of the first symbioses to be described in the natural
2220320	2221320	world.
2221320	2229960	A Swiss botanist Simon Schrendener put forward his dual hypothesis of lichens in 1869.
2229960	2235520	In this, he posited that the fungi were enslaving parasites that had forced the photosynthetic
2235520	2241720	algae into service to reduce sugar and energy for them, albeit with the promise of harbour
2241720	2244320	and nutrients in return.
2244320	2250920	Today, however, we know the relationship between the two lichen partners to be much more equitable,
2250920	2258760	although the deeper scientists probe, the more complex the picture becomes.
2258760	2265320	In most lichens, there are more than two co-operating organisms, as several different fungal species
2265320	2270920	work together in a way that mutually benefits all parties.
2270920	2279880	Indeed, lichen scholars have yet to find how deep the symbiotic rabbit hole goes.
2279880	2284800	Together with algae and lichens, with trees in the wood-wide web, or with humanity in
2284800	2294720	modern civilisations, fungi have made themselves invaluable partners in many of Earth's ecosystems.
2294720	2299360	Their integration and interaction with nearly every living thing on the planet ultimately
2299360	2306400	blurs the line of where fungi end and everything else begins.
2306400	2314200	A collection of organisms, not just master and slave, not just individual singers, but
2314200	2321160	a song.
2321160	2328640	And so, tracing the origins of these remarkable organisms requires that we first understand
2328640	2342000	exactly what they are.
2342000	2346440	Chernobyl, 1986
2346440	2352240	A catastrophic explosion at a nuclear plant in what is now northern Ukraine sees radioactive
2352240	2357320	waste spread across much of Europe.
2357320	2362000	For many kilometres around the leaking plant, contamination levels are high enough to cause
2362000	2369480	radiation poisoning and deadly cancers.
2369480	2374480	Inarguably the worst nuclear disaster the world has ever seen, a 10 square kilometre area
2374480	2380160	of the surrounding forest is killed outright by radioactive material amounting to 20 times
2380160	2388840	that of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
2388840	2398320	The region becomes known as the Red Forest, after the colour of its dead and dying trees.
2398320	2408680	Every animal that couldn't flee ultimately perishing from the overwhelming corruption.
2408680	2414240	After the disaster the Chernobyl plant itself was closed down, but the radioactive fuel
2414240	2417800	it still contained was left in situ.
2417800	2422280	In order to prevent any further reaction and to protect the immediate area from the effects
2422280	2430600	of radiation, the fuel is stored in huge vats of water.
2430600	2437920	The clear water itself glows with unearthly blue Cherenkov radiation, generated as the
2437920	2446760	decaying fuel splits water molecules, releasing energy in the form of light.
2446760	2454240	Only the water isn't clear anymore.
2454240	2459960	Over the years it has become blackened.
2459960	2472160	And the agent of this darkening is, remarkably, a fungus.
2472160	2476440	Many species of fungi are known to be extremer files.
2476440	2480440	They are able to tolerate conditions well beyond the limits of what we would consider
2480440	2483840	a comfortable existence.
2483840	2490600	Beyond such tolerance is the ability to withstand high levels of radioactivity.
2490600	2496240	The same levels that were enough to ravage the planets and animals of the Red Forest.
2496240	2501800	And so here, in the intensely radioactive waters of the abandoned Chernobyl plant, the
2501800	2508120	radio-resistant fungi have found a way to survive.
2508120	2514080	And more surprisingly, these hardy organisms seem to be doing more than merely surviving
2514080	2517080	here.
2517080	2522640	Scientists have found them growing towards the hot radioactive particles, and using the
2522640	2528360	energy from radioactive decay in much the same way as plants use the light energy from
2528360	2532320	the sun.
2532320	2540520	Despite unimaginable dangers, these fungal organisms have found a way to feed on radioactivity,
2540520	2545280	perhaps digging deep in their primordial genetic makeup to find a new niche in the wake of
2545280	2549080	radioactive devastation.
2549080	2552760	The discovery has staggering implications.
2552760	2558520	If a mushroom can adapt to eat nuclear waste, then surely other waste products can be consumed
2558520	2569960	too, perhaps most importantly, plastics.
2569960	2575240	The remarkable colonisers of Chernobyl comprise just a single variety among a staggering diversity
2575240	2583720	of fungal species, with seemingly endless adaptations to a wide range of habitats,
2583720	2588000	lifestyles and symbiotic association.
2588000	2594320	There are single-celled yeasts, vast mycorrhizal networks, fungi that build mushrooms of every
2594320	2599960	conceivable shape and size, fungi that are cultured exclusively inside the nests of leaf
2599960	2608480	cutarans, fungi that live only on and in the human body, and not to mention the countless
2608480	2617440	lichenized forms hiding in plain sight.
2617440	2623480	Although only 150,000 species have been formally described, scientists estimate there may be
2623480	2637280	as many as 3.8 million species here on Earth, outnumbering plants by roughly 10 to 1.
2637280	2644600	They have been incredibly successful, and are incredibly old, 500 million years at the
2644600	2646360	very least.
2646360	2652040	If close enough in evolution, mycelium from some fungi can blend seamlessly with other
2652040	2653040	species.
2653040	2659760	Of course, given this cross-species breeding and being, fungi are almost the very definition
2659760	2665440	of other.
2665440	2674440	The polyphonic way they experience the world is immensely different to our monophony.
2674440	2680760	With so much diversity, it can become difficult to identify the features that unite fungi,
2680760	2684600	rather than set them apart from one another.
2684600	2690000	One mycological idea is that we should abandon dividing them into species altogether, due
2690000	2699560	to the inadequate categorizations given to them for hundreds, if not thousands of years.
2699560	2705080	Thought to be merely parasites until very recently, for influential Swedish botanist Carl
2705080	2709360	Linnaeus, they were chaos incarnate.
2709360	2714640	Others genuinely thought them caused by lightning strikes.
2714640	2719520	By the 19th century, they were categorized as plants, and only in the mid-1960s were
2719520	2730120	they granted an entire kingdom of their own, for in reality, fungi are closer to animals.
2730120	2734800	They are eukaryotes, set apart from their bacterial cousins through the presence of a
2734800	2741360	nucleus and other membrane-bound machinery inside their cells.
2741360	2746120	They lack the photosynthetic chloroplasts that plants possess, and despite being historically
2746120	2751040	grouped among plants on account of their vegetative lifestyle, fungi actually share
2751040	2754320	more in common with animals than with any other kingdom.
2754320	2760320	Indeed, many fungi contain the same light-sensitive pigments as can be found in our own eyes,
2760320	2764720	and their compatible biochemistry is what makes them such potent allies in the field
2764720	2768840	of human medicine.
2768840	2773560	Together with animals and single-celled protists, the fungi are part of a larger group, known
2773560	2778640	as epistakons, but justify their own kingdom through the possession of unique features shared
2778640	2784680	by neither animal or protist.
2784680	2792160	They are defined in part by their unique mode of growth, from probing hyphal tips, and the
2792160	2797680	ability of these hyphae to digest their food outside the fungal body rather than an internal
2797680	2799960	stomach.
2799960	2807840	Typically, hyphae can be recognized by their ability to branch, often at right angles and
2807840	2813720	to converge and fuse again further down the line.
2813720	2817960	And fungal cells, regardless of their habitat, are all strengthened by a specific kind of
2817960	2822480	biological polymer, known as chitin.
2822480	2826080	Some animals also make use of chitin for protection.
2826080	2832520	This is especially common in the ecosystems of arthropods like insects and crabs.
2832520	2838160	But only in fungi is it ubiquitous around each and every cell.
2838160	2843720	This toolkit of classifying features allows paleontologists to trace the fungal kingdom
2843720	2852800	back through the mists of time, and to begin to search for the origins of fungi on Earth.
2852800	2858160	That is the uniquely hyphal microstructure found in fossil specimens of proto-taxities
2858160	2863840	that best supports its fungal interpretation.
2863840	2869800	But an absence of corroborating biochemistry makes the conclusion of giant fungi 470 million
2869800	2873160	years ago a somewhat tentative one.
2873160	2879520	Instead, paleontologists consider the oldest uncontested fungal fossils to be those preserved
2879520	2887240	in intricate cellular detail in the 410 million-year-old glassy shirts of Reiny, Scotland.
2887240	2894600	Here, a wide diversity of fungal types are preserved as if in crystal-clear resin, painting
2894600	2900480	a picture of a terrestrial Devonian world in which fungi have already found and exploited
2900480	2904440	many of their modern-day niches.
2904440	2908840	These specimens are by no means the first of their kind, appearing as they do already
2908840	2915520	adapted to their chosen lifestyles.
2915520	2922360	But they do serve an important purpose in modern paleontological analysis.
2922360	2927320	Genetic and physiological analysis of fungi alive today allow them to be plotted onto an
2927320	2934360	evolutionary family tree, with more recently derived species forming the most distant twigs
2934360	2942880	and more ancestral forms branching closer to the root.
2942880	2947120	Finding and plotting the fossil specimens onto this family tree helps to orient those
2947120	2954800	relationships in time as well as in evolutionary space, and to calibrate estimates on the rate
2954800	2960560	of fungal evolution on the basis of genetic transformation.
2960560	2966080	Using these statistical tools, modern paleontologists have estimated that the origins of the fungal
2966080	2972280	kingdom extend back long before the age of giant proto-taxities.
2972280	2981520	Indeed, they suggest that we should be searching for the first fungi back in the Neo-proto-Rzoic
2981520	2990400	between 1,750 million years ago, before even plants or animals have made a definitive appearance.
2990400	3001720	Long before the green abundance of the Devonian, when the terrestrial earth was still a wasteland.
3001720	3008560	With no soil to speak of, all nutrients trapped within rocks, it seems at least possible that
3008560	3013900	algae and fungus made it onto the land together.
3013900	3019840	Like the aftermath of Chernobyl and countless mass extinction events before, early pioneers
3019840	3041360	leading the way for more life to follow.
3041360	3045800	Just outside the thriving city of Mbunji Mai in the heart of the Democratic Republic of
3045800	3057960	Congo, rolling tropical grasslands are pushed aside by the inexorable advance of industry.
3057960	3062920	Ever since the discovery of diamonds here in 1909, the gentle hillsides have been torn
3062920	3068400	open, exposing wounds of bright red soil and filling the rivers with the same blood red
3068400	3071400	silt.
3072400	3078720	Today, though one of the most troubled regions on the planet, the area supplies some 10%
3078720	3082360	of the world's diamonds.
3082360	3087760	Respecting geologists continue to search for more in the ancient rocks beneath the surface,
3087760	3092520	there is no other material like it.
3092520	3098320	In the absence of any great mountains or sharp rocky escarpments in this part of the country,
3098320	3102920	geologists must actively drill down into the rocks beneath their feet.
3102920	3108560	And one such drill core, not far from the bustle of the DRC's second city, has revealed
3108560	3115200	hidden treasures, although not the kind that will bring economic geologists running.
3115200	3121800	The Kanshi B-13 core penetrates limestone and shaley rocks that are neoproterozoic in
3121800	3128440	age, and which were likely deposited in a warm perennial lake.
3128440	3136720	Here, as in so many rocks of this age, paleontologists have found spherical microfossils that are
3136720	3142040	thought to belong to primitive eukaryotic algae.
3142040	3150280	But at a depth of more than 100 meters, the extracted core contains something else, something
3150280	3157000	much more remarkable for the time.
3157000	3163800	In a layer aged between 810 and 715 million years old, an international team of scientists
3163800	3169640	have identified curious filamentous fossils preserved in three dimensions by crystalline
3169640	3174880	limestone.
3174880	3180440	Each filament is less than 10 microns, 100th of a millimetre across and up to a millimetre
3180440	3184720	in length.
3184720	3192120	But together they pack densely into an interconnected mesh of branching and fusing strands.
3192120	3202640	In shape and arrangement alone, they are surprisingly similar to the hyphae of modern mycelial network.
3202640	3210640	But at an age almost double that of the oldest confirmed fungi, it will take more than morphology
3210640	3216400	to make a case for these supposed neoproterozoic fungi.
3216400	3223000	Fortunately, these filaments are preserved in such a way that allow scientists to search
3223000	3228800	for other strengthening strands of evidence to support the fungal conclusion.
3228800	3233440	Using a technique called Raman spectroscopy, which uses laser light to reveal the nature
3233440	3239000	of chemical bonds in a structure, they found the filaments to be composed of organic material
3239000	3246440	that had undergone the same heating and compression as the surrounding rock.
3246440	3251160	This implies that they are just as ancient as the limestone that surrounds them, and
3251160	3255000	not the result of some secondary infiltration.
3256000	3260240	Next, the researchers employed a kind of chemical straining that's typically used
3260240	3263800	to identify fungi in modern soils.
3263800	3269080	The stain clings to the chitin that uniquely makes up fungal cell walls and not to anything
3269080	3276920	else, causing the fungal members of the community to glow green under specific microscopic light.
3276920	3282400	And sure enough, when the fossil filaments were treated with the stain, they glowed the
3282400	3290320	characteristic green, suggesting that chitin was a significant part of their original organic structure.
3293320	3299040	These multiple lines of evidence from morphology to chemical composition are necessary to substantiate
3299040	3306120	what is ultimately a remarkable claim, that recognizable fungal mycelia had already evolved
3306120	3312960	at least 715 million years ago.
3312960	3317680	This mycelium would have lived within the sediment, just under the water or at the shore of the
3317680	3325600	neoprotozoic lake, feeding on decaying organic matter from algae and bacteria.
3325600	3331640	It is a lifestyle almost identical to that of many mycelia today, and these fossils suggest
3331640	3340280	it has an origin deeper in the past than we might imagine, but even these are not the
3340280	3346000	oldest fungal candidates found to date.
3346000	3350400	In the far north of the Canadian Northwest Territories, on the desolate frosted shores
3350400	3358240	of the Arctic Ocean, dark-coloured shales have been dated to around 1 billion years old,
3358240	3365360	around 2 or 300 million years older than the limestones of the DRC.
3365360	3372040	Here, traditional micro paleontological methods, which involve dissolving away the solid rock
3372040	3377200	to leave behind the organic material trapped within, has yielded micro fossils with a unique
3377200	3383000	shape and structure that hints at a fungal affinity.
3383000	3387080	Large spheres between 3 and 8 hundredths of a millimetre across are attached to narrow
3387080	3393160	filaments which branch at right angles to one another.
3393160	3396880	Researchers have interpreted these structures as the reproductive spores and connective
3396880	3401960	hyphae of fungi.
3401960	3407320	And while the wealth of analytical data is not as great as the younger African specimens,
3407320	3411920	chemical analysis of these Canadian examples does seem to suggest the presence of fungal
3411920	3417880	chitin within the walls as well.
3417880	3422200	Although these conclusions are more tentative, the possible appearance of already distinct
3422200	3427480	fungal structures at this earlier point in time does seem to be honing in on the earliest
3427480	3435040	origins of the fungal kingdom.
3435040	3440480	Elsewhere around the world, fossils reveal some of the earliest possible holozoans,
3440480	3443920	their precursors to true animals.
3443920	3447520	That the fossil evidence of fungi seems to be consistent with genetic estimates of their
3447520	3453000	appearance too, helps to build a picture of microbial diversity at the very beginning
3453000	3459560	of the neoproterozoic, perhaps due in part to the stability and worldwide strife of the
3459560	3462560	boring billion.
3462560	3469480	This then could be the age where our ancestors and the fungi went their separate ways, diverging
3469480	3475880	on very different evolutionary paths.
3475880	3483600	However, there is one more fungal fossil candidate, which seems to blow this neatly
3483600	3488520	converging picture apart.
3488520	3494440	In 2017, paleontologists from Sweden and Australia found structures inside the bubbles of ancient
3494440	3504120	lava flows that also seem to show a curiously fungal habit.
3504120	3513240	The key difference is that these samples from South Africa are 2.4 billion years old.
3513240	3517080	Inside these basaltic bubbles, which form naturally as gases attempt to escape through
3517080	3522880	sticky liquid magma, the researchers have found filaments, the typical dimensions of
3522880	3531040	fungal hyphae, which branch and fuse in a compellingly mycelial way.
3531040	3535800	The morphology argument may be strong, but the unique preservation and extreme antiquity
3535800	3544400	of these specimens renders any supporting chemical analysis impossible.
3544400	3548400	And at more than a billion years older than when the fungal genome is thought to have
3549400	3554920	The fungal interpretation is perhaps too extraordinary a claim.
3554920	3559880	Yet even if they are not true fungi as we have come to define them, there is no denying
3559880	3565280	the mycelial habit.
3565280	3570520	Perhaps more primitive organisms, whether bacteria or some of the first eukaryotes,
3570520	3577320	experimented with a mesh-like mycelium long before the fungal kingdom made it their own.
3577400	3583640	All of these ancient fungal and mycelial discoveries have been made within the last 5 years, highlighting
3583640	3591160	just how immature the science of fungal paleontology is, much like mycology in general, which hovers
3591160	3595040	awkwardly somewhere between plant and animal studies.
3595040	3600920	Indeed, it is only in the last few decades that ecologists have come to realize the staggering
3600920	3606840	diversity and vital importance of fungi in modern ecosystems.
3606880	3611200	Catching glimpses of them within the fossil record, whether in their monumental success
3611200	3617400	as Devonian proto-taxities, their understated diversity in the rhiney-chert, or in their
3617400	3625240	earliest microbial manifestations in the neoprotozoic, reveals just how influential fungi have been
3625240	3628840	through much of life's history.
3628840	3633760	They have played a crucial role in cycling nutrients and shaping ecosystems for much
3633760	3636680	longer than we may have imagined.
3636680	3641920	Perhaps creating soil in the first place, and certainly keeping it healthy for other
3641920	3644680	forms of life.
3644680	3649760	It is very likely that it was fungi that supported and enabled the success of other kingdoms
3649760	3656520	of life throughout the neoprotozoic and beyond, just as it was fungi who facilitated the colonization
3656520	3660520	of land some 450 million years ago.
3661520	3669520	As well as the re-colonization of blasted landscapes after mass extinction events.
3672520	3680520	For as much as a billion years or more, it seems, everywhere life seeks to explore,
3680520	3686520	fungi have been one step ahead, preparing the way.
3691520	3698520	And with the development of so-called mycotechture, being investigated for space travel and habitation,
3698520	3703520	it is a role that may just continue long into the future.
