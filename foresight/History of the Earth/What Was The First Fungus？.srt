1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,640
In the early morning hours over Gondwana, the air is calm and still, as the stars gradually

2
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,520
fade away in the rapidly lightening sky.

3
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:26,040
A few clouds high in the atmosphere catch a glimpse of the sunrise to come, reflecting

4
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:34,480
the same pink that now grows through the sky's lower reaches.

5
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:40,480
Suddenly and silently, without a warning or fanfare, a flaring brightness pierces the horizon,

6
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,320
and the orb of the sun emerges shimmering, appearing improbably large reflected in the

7
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:51,520
ocean's surface.

8
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:57,760
The world turns, and as the sun's light washes over the eastern shore of Gondwana, the landscape

9
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,000
of the stevanian world is transformed.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,280
Lands surfaces that were dimly lit by diffuse and hazy pre-dawn glow mere moments ago are

11
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:13,360
now cast into sharp and eerie contrast as the sun's impossibly low angle projects elongated

12
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:19,640
shadows from every hillside, bluff and living thing.

13
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:26,600
Under this bizarre lighting, the reality of a 400 million-year-old terrestrial world

14
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,320
is revealed.

15
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:34,000
Gone are the days of the barren, lifeless supercontinent.

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:45,000
This immense land surface is now covered from shore to shore with terrestrial life.

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:57,800
And it is still early days for the organisms who have forsaken the safety of the ocean.

18
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:04,120
Insects and worms inch, crawl and clamber, but none have yet taken to the skies.

19
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:11,240
Plants, alien and strange to our eyes, only recognizable as such by their green coloration,

20
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:16,680
spread haphazardly over the reddish soil.

21
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,800
There are few of the leaves, stalks, seeds and roots that will come to characterize later

22
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,000
vascular plants and trees.

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Instead, these early colonizers creep and extend, occasionally projecting a fragile,

24
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,200
rubbery stem a few tens of centimeters above the earth.

25
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,720
And under the low morning sun, the shadows of these plants are, like the primitive plants

26
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,160
themselves, stunted.

27
00:02:48,160 --> 00:03:00,120
But occasionally, huge, slender shadows extend many meters across the rolling landscape.

28
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:07,400
Immense, organic but otherwise featureless towers, the largest of which reaches eight

29
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:16,120
meters in height and one meter across.

30
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:21,680
In an early terrestrial world dominated by primitive plants no more than a meter high,

31
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:32,840
these monumental columns are huge and bizarre.

32
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,640
But they are not plants, neither have they been wrought by the might of the earth or

33
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:42,240
the craft of any sentient life as we know it.

34
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:50,400
They are fungi, unimaginably huge mushroom skyscrapers that dwarf all other life on the

35
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,320
surface of the Devonian earth.

36
00:03:53,320 --> 00:04:02,280
It is strange enough to consider a fungus reaching such mammoth proportions today, but

37
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:15,160
it is even more remarkable in the relatively young terrestrial niche.

38
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:21,640
The first fossils of these mysterious organic structures, recovered from Gaspe Bay in Quebec,

39
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:29,200
were described more than 160 years ago by Canadian geologist John William Dawson.

40
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,840
As was not uncommon at the time, John Dawson was a creationist, believing that all living

41
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:40,960
things bestowed upon the earth were of the great creators making, arguing vehemently

42
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,400
against Charles Darwin's new and radical theory of evolution.

43
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:53,640
It is perhaps not surprising then, when faced with these bizarre Devonian fossils, Dawson's

44
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:59,440
explanation erred on the side of the familiar.

45
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:07,160
They were, he claimed, the remains of partially rotten, giant conifers.

46
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:17,280
And he named them proto-taxities, roughly translating as first U.

47
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,760
But Dawson's supposedly rotten specimens weren't even the first proto-taxities fossils

48
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:25,680
to be collected.

49
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,400
Some 17 years earlier, one of Darwin's friends and colleagues, Joseph Hooker, recovered similar

50
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,560
remnants from Devonian rocks in Scotland.

51
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:44,760
Unfortunately, the samples being mislaid until 2012.

52
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:49,880
In the intervening years, many other examples of proto-taxities were found, from terrestrial

53
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,200
rocks all over the world.

54
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:58,120
Now they can be found in abundance in deposits from the mid-Ordovician, 470 million years

55
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:03,440
old, to the late Devonian aged 360 million years.

56
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,320
These mysterious living monuments existed for 20 times the length of humanity's own

57
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,880
reign.

58
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:16,200
Given the immense diversity of fungi today, from slime molds, fungal infections to edible

59
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,400
oyster mushrooms.

60
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:24,520
The bizarre morphology of proto-taxities has attracted many alternative explanations.

61
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:30,200
From that of a stringy alga, like seaweed, to a fortuitously rolled-up bundle of non-vascular

62
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,360
plants like liverwort.

63
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:38,920
But the scientific consensus of the 21st century is that these seemingly impossible structures

64
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:44,360
are in fact members of a long overlooked but nevertheless omnipresent kingdom.

65
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,880
The Fungi

66
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,960
Prototaxity's large size and widespread habitat throughout the Devonian is a clear implication

67
00:06:53,960 --> 00:07:00,240
that they were successful, and likely owed that success to a long and prosperous evolutionary

68
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,600
line.

69
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:07,280
The humble Fungi, which lived our lives practically out of sight and without which many of our

70
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:13,640
modern ecosystems would not be able to survive, have been lurking in the background for longer

71
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,560
than we may imagine.

72
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:23,880
So, as we rewind the evolutionary clock from this curious age when vast mushrooms towered

73
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:34,000
over all life on Earth, how far must we go to find their beginnings?

74
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:41,200
What were the first Fungi on the planet and how did they come to shape our modern world?

75
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:47,720
The answer might just be more amazing than we could have possibly imagined.

76
00:07:47,720 --> 00:08:01,040
The implications stretching far into our future, as well as our past.

77
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,720
The history of our world spans more than four billion years, that's a lot of ground

78
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,080
to cover.

79
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:12,600

87
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:12,760
In the blue mountains of eastern Oregon, bright alpine lakes shine like gemstones amidst

88
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,800
the mountain meadows.

89
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:27,520
Marching pine forests stretch off into the distance.

90
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:34,320
The Malur National Forest is a peaceful, natural wilderness, popular with hunters, herders

91
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,440
and hikers alike.

92
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:43,840
And yet, unlikely as it seems, this forest is home to the largest and one of the oldest

93
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:53,040
living beings on Earth.

94
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,720
Like the mythical Sasquatch, it hides from sight.

95
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,160
This enigmatic organism can only be spotted at certain times of the year and then only

96
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,040
if you know where to look.

97
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:10,760
However, unlike Bigfoot, once glimpsed, this elusive entity is unable to make good its

98
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:16,400
escape, since it is rooted, quite literally, beneath the ground.

99
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:29,240
In 1998, a team of scientists set out to map the distribution of a deadly pathogenic fungus

100
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,440
in eastern Oregon.

101
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,480
In the moist autumns of the US Pacific coast, dark honey mushrooms sprout all around the

102
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:44,000
bases of ailing pine trees.

103
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,400
Named for the golden colour of their caps, they are certainly attractive specimens.

104
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:56,720
They are a symptom of a much more sinister phenomenon unfolding beneath the surface.

105
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:03,000
For the honey mushrooms are only the fruiting bodies of the armillaria fungus, which survives

106
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:12,040
by infecting and attacking the roots and trunks of living trees.

107
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:18,760
It is a parasite feared by foresters all over the world, and by the time its mushrooms emerge,

108
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:24,600
it is typically too late for the luckless tree, which has been eaten away from the inside

109
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:31,240
by the insinuating fungal fibres.

110
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:35,000
In order to investigate the spread of this fungal parasite throughout the idyllic woodland

111
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,080
of Malur, the scientists combined traditional, mycological techniques with the latest in

112
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,920
20th century genetic fingerprinting.

113
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,240
In the following samples of the fungal fibres from separate afflicted trees, they combined

114
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,520
them in a petri dish to see if they would grow together and fuse, implying that they

115
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:58,360
were of compatible genetic stock.

116
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:04,120
And by extracting and analysing their DNA, the similarities and differences in their

117
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:09,160
genes could be compared side by side.

118
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:14,120
The results of this analysis were astounding.

119
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:21,960
At every tree they sampled over a 10 square kilometre area, the armillaria fungus was genetically

120
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:26,600
identical.

121
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:31,960
Just as the cells in our own bodies are genetic clones of one another, so too were these fungal

122
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,320
fibres.

123
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:41,320
And just as our genetic makeup defines our individuality from other members of our species,

124
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:49,320
so the fibres of armillaria were all part of one immense fungal individual.

125
00:12:53,320 --> 00:13:03,400
Here, just beneath the forest floor, was the largest individual organism on earth.

126
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:08,480
Nicknamed the humongous fungus for good reason.

127
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:20,040
Three metres beneath the surface, it extends over an area of some 2,384 acres.

128
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:27,240
It dwarfs the largest living animal, the 33 metre long blue whale, and even trumps the

129
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:37,880
largest plant colony, the 107 acre quaking aspen of Utah, named Pando.

130
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:45,680
And yet this monstrous fungus could easily be missed, if not for its golden mushrooms

131
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:52,760
and the dying trees it leaves in its wake.

132
00:13:52,760 --> 00:14:00,000
Because the immense body of armillaria is actually made of a network of gossamer fibres, which

133
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,280
even at their densest look little more than white moldy fur.

134
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:13,680
And yet this mycelial network, the true vegetative form of many fungi all over the world, is

135
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:19,880
much greater than the sum of its diminutive parts.

136
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:34,320
Not as an individual, per se, but a collective.

137
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:43,480
The armillaria of eastern Oregon is not only remarkable in its size, but also its age.

138
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:50,280
Based on its rate of growth, scientists estimate this humongous fungus to be at least 2,400

139
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:59,120
years old, and possibly almost twice that.

140
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:04,800
It has seen the rise and fall of civilisations and religions.

141
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:15,440
The lives and deaths of almost 100 human generations.

142
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,400
But this ancient organism is far from dormant.

143
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:25,200
It, like all mycelia, is vibrantly alive, continually shifting and migrating through

144
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,760
the forest soil.

145
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:32,160
Much faster and stranger than the roots of a plant.

146
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:40,480
For as we now know from roots discovered in 2017, mycelium itself seems to have been around

147
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:50,560
for far longer, perhaps for more than 2 billion years, roughly half of Earth's history.

148
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:04,440
The mycelial network stretching beneath the forest floor is composed of countless fungal

149
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:11,520
fibres known as hyphae, each five times thinner than a human herb.

150
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:17,280
But with the capacity to branch and fuse to create a woven mesh.

151
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:22,840
This three-dimensional net can be so dense that a single teaspoon of mycelium can contain

152
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:29,720
as much as 10 kilometres of ultrafine hyphae.

153
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:34,040
Each fungal individual defines and expands its borders through the probing growth of

154
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:40,760
hyphal tips, similar to the exploratory hairs of plants' roots and shoots, yet far more

155
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,760
numerous.

156
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:46,960
A large mycelial network may contain billions of hyphal tips whose exploration through the

157
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:55,880
soil helps to locate food sources, grow and renew the fungal body.

158
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:00,360
Hyphae may be small, but they are mighty.

159
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:05,640
Despite being only one cell thick, they can nevertheless knit together to create solid

160
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:10,440
three-dimensional structures.

161
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:16,560
Like the golden edible mushroom caps of Armillaria, the rigid shelves of the polypore bracket

162
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:27,080
fungus and even the towering columns of proto-taxities.

163
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:32,120
There have been documented cases of newly surfaced roads being ripped open by the growth

164
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:40,040
of mushrooms through the tarmac, and experiments have shown that growing hyphae can summon

165
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:47,360
enough force to penetrate Kevlar.

166
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,560
Of course the main purpose of these mycelial hyphae is not to pierce armour and ravage

167
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,120
our infrastructure.

168
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:58,160
When they're not assembling elaborate fruiting bodies, hyphae are primarily occupied with

169
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:07,400
the all-consuming task of feeding the voracious fungal entity.

170
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:12,520
Oozing digestive enzymes out into the space around them, they supervise the breakdown

171
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:22,960
of organic matter, then reabsorb the products.

172
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,120
But they are capable of much more than just devouring.

173
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:34,160
The probing behaviour of millions of hyphal tips is like that of an immense swarm, acquiring

174
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:41,120
and integrating information simultaneously on a massively parallel basis and on a scale

175
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:54,280
that rivals most home computers.

176
00:18:54,280 --> 00:19:00,000
Recent experiments have proven that mycelium can navigate its way through mazes to find

177
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:11,760
the quickest route to the end.

178
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:17,680
Deciding whether to pursue or abandon a path of exploration relies on communication between

179
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:25,840
distant reaches of the mycelial network.

180
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:31,160
Although scientists are still unsure precisely how such communication takes place, they have

181
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:38,200
observed it to be lightning fast, much faster for example than the chemical discourse of

182
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:52,120
plants and perhaps more similar to the electrical signalling along our own nerve cells.

183
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:56,480
As the hyphae grow, sever or reinforce their links dynamically based on the information

184
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:10,360
they receive, the mycelial network on the whole may be likened to a brain.

185
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:16,640
Are mycelial fungi therefore capable of decision making?

186
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,040
Problem solving?

187
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:28,580
Like octopi, lacking a conventional nervous system, yet seeming to think with their tentacles.

188
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:32,880
Do they possess a spark of intelligence in that hyphal brain, a composition of many life

189
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:38,320
forms coming together to create a larger, more formidable whole?

190
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:49,280
If so, it is unlike any intelligence that we are accustomed to recognizing.

191
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:54,560
And yet, it was Charles Darwin who wrote that intelligence is based on how efficient a species

192
00:20:54,560 --> 00:21:01,560
becomes at doing the things they need to survive.

193
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:06,280
Given the monumental success of the giant armillaria and all other fungi whose bodies

194
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:12,720
are composed of shifting, entwining hyphal nets, it's not hard to appreciate their efficiency,

195
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:20,920
even if acknowledging intelligence is a step too far.

196
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:26,120
Though bizarrely they do seem to exhibit traits of memory on occasion, without the need for

197
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:32,440
a brain as we would recognize it, in truth we still know very little of fungi and their

198
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:38,160
strange collective lives.

199
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:43,280
By themselves mycelial networks are forced to be reckoned with, and yet their power to

200
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:49,040
shape and transform a living ecosystem is even more formidable.

201
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:54,160
The inexorable growth of hyphae and the enzyme cocktail they excrete is enough to shatter

202
00:21:54,160 --> 00:22:01,960
rock over and over, creating the first soils in a bare landscape, and then, through their

203
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:07,160
dense organic net, holding the ground in place.

204
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:14,680
It is fungi who help pave the way for modern plants and animals to colonize virgin ground,

205
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:20,040
and it was likely fungi who helped plants to make the leap onto land in the first place,

206
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:24,960
470 million years ago.

207
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,280
For those first colonizing plants did not yet have the root systems that would allow

208
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:36,440
them to access nutrients from the thin or division soil.

209
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:43,160
And so, researchers think that mycelial networks stepped up and fulfilled that role, at least

210
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:47,680
for a few tens of millions of years.

211
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:54,800
A role they continue to be an integral part of in forests all over the world.

212
00:22:54,800 --> 00:23:01,000
In this way, it was fungi who have enabled, shaped and guided the course of terrestrial

213
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,960
evolution.

214
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:13,920
Fungi make mushrooms, but first, they have to unmake something else.

215
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:19,360
In this great recycling of organic matter that keeps our world moving, keeps evolution ever

216
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:24,360
pushing onwards, they are the main players.

217
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:31,040
And yet, still now, despite decades of research, we still know so little about these creatures

218
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:35,400
with whom we share, a common ancestor.

219
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:40,720
Modern science is still delving deep to find out just how far these inscrutable fungal

220
00:23:40,720 --> 00:24:02,440
lives are entwined with our own, and with every other living thing on earth.

221
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:09,800
In the year 1487, so says the Spanish friar Diego Durán, writing two generations later,

222
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:18,240
a particularly significant occasion took place at the Mexico Aztec capital of Tenochtitlán,

223
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:23,840
one of the largest cities the world had ever seen, the beating heart of the most powerful

224
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:29,800
of all Mesoamerican empires.

225
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:35,080
An early anthropologist of sorts, Durán sought to preserve the history of the rapidly disappearing

226
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,580
Aztecs.

227
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:43,800
By his day, subject to Christianity and harsh Spanish colonial rule, he did this by doing

228
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:51,920
what many refused to do, by talking and engaging with the surviving elders, recording for posterity,

229
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,120
what they told.

230
00:24:54,120 --> 00:25:03,760
On this particular occasion, in 1487, Durán records a particularly grisly event.

231
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,800
The new emperor, Ahuid Sotl, one of the most formidable military leaders in the entire

232
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:16,360
history of the new world, did things on a grand scale.

233
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:22,000
Following his accession and successful conquests into new lands, over the course of four days,

234
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:33,000
tens of thousands of captive warriors ascended the templo mayor at the heart of the city.

235
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,580
One by one, their beating hearts were cut from their chests.

236
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:47,920
Sacrificial blood offered to the gods as part of the ceremonial rededication of the empire.

237
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:54,200
Yet for those not taking part in the orgy of human sacrifice, the extended coronation

238
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:59,320
festival is cause for uninhibited celebration.

239
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:06,200
Chocolate is drunk, songs are sung and a very special delicacy is enjoyed.

240
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:12,120
Known locally as Teonana cattle, the flesh of the gods is a small spindly mushroom with

241
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:17,880
a white stem and golden cap.

242
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:26,600
Veterans eat it raw, all with a little honey, and are instantly transformed.

243
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,760
Some find themselves laughing and dancing uncontrollably.

244
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:38,920
Others experience strange and disturbing visions of war, demons, or even their own deaths.

245
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:45,120
Some are overcome, weeping openly, while others take quietly to their houses in a meditative

246
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:51,080
mood.

247
00:26:51,080 --> 00:27:00,040
And after these journeys and visions, they come together to discuss what they saw.

248
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:06,640
They believe that the mushrooms were gifted to the Aztec people by this serpent god Quetzalcoatl,

249
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:14,680
and that consuming them gives them the power to commune with their gods.

250
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:20,560
They are a frequent component of celebrations, healing, and religious rituals.

251
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:25,760
Whether Jurán or subsequent Spanish colonizers also sample the sacred mushrooms, we do not

252
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:31,600
know, and later conquistadors made great efforts to erase all records of the mind-altering

253
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:40,720
substances, as well as the culture of the pre-Columbian Americas.

254
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,480
After the fall of the Aztec Empire, it was difficult to learn more about the supposedly

255
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:52,000
psychedelic fungi, or even identify the individual mushrooms responsible.

256
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:59,080
Their very existence became controversial.

257
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:03,800
Was the flesh of the gods little more than a myth itself invented by a traumatized chronicler

258
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:10,680
to distance from the horrors of human sacrifice?

259
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:38,800
Now, of course, we know these transcendental fungi as magic mushrooms, containing a chemical

260
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:43,840
compound called psilocybin that can produce a psychedelic trip and hallucinations like

261
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:50,840
that of the drug LSD.

262
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:54,920
In fact, LSD itself was first synthesized from the chemicals produced by a different

263
00:28:54,920 --> 00:29:01,880
kind of fungus, and there are many such mushrooms capable of inducing similar experiences.

264
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:13,040
While Diego Durán might have been one of the first westerners to hear of the ritual

265
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:24,480
consumption of these mushrooms, the 15th-century Aztecs were by no means the first partake.

266
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:29,080
Ancient manuscripts that predate the Spanish conquest depict feathered deities holding

267
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:34,800
and eating mushrooms, and mushroom-shaped statues have been discovered from Mesoamerica

268
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:46,360
stretching back to the 2nd millennium BC.

269
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:52,360
Elsewhere in the world, reverence for the spiritual mushroom extends back even further.

270
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:58,520
Cave paintings in Algeria created between 7000 and 9000 BCE depict a godly figure with

271
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:06,920
an animal's head and mushroom-like figures sprouting from its shoulders and arms.

272
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:12,240
In Classical Greece, a secretive ceremonial meeting known as the Eleusinian Mysteries,

273
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:17,720
frequented by the likes of Plato, has long been theorized to involve the use of the psychedelic

274
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:25,160
ergot fungi.

275
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:31,200
It is the kind of bizarre image that the straight-minded might find hard to interpret, but which makes

276
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:38,600
ultimate sense to a psilocybin connoisseur.

277
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:43,120
The deep, interlinked history of humans and psychedelic fungi has even given rise to a

278
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:48,960
controversial theory, that it is the mushrooms themselves that are the architects of our

279
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,960
humanity.

280
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:57,720
Anthropologists have long grappled with the puzzling speed by which human culture, social

281
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:04,160
structure, commerce and art seem to appear among the human species 50-70,000 years ago

282
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:21,720
during the Paleolithic era.

283
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:26,960
Scars on fossilized leaves from 48 million years ago indicative of infection by the Cordyceps

284
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:33,120
fungus suggests fungi may have been manipulating minds for as long as there have been minds

285
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:38,720
to manipulate.

286
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,920
Witnessing the transformative effects of psilocybin on the human mind today, and the uncanny

287
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:49,480
ability of certain fungi to influence their life forms around them, certain fringe scholars

288
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:54,120
have suggested it was the hallucinogenic effects of these mushrooms that allowed our

289
00:31:54,120 --> 00:32:02,680
ancestors to expand their minds in the first place.

290
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:07,640
This so-called stoned ape theory of human evolution certainly sits at the fringes of

291
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:13,360
science, and with little tangible evidence from that time, unfortunately we may simply

292
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:23,120
never know how much of our modern civilization we owe to the psychedelic trips of our forebears.

293
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:29,440
But even if hallucinogenic mushrooms have played a marginal role, fungi in general have

294
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:38,400
had a potent connection with humans for at least as long as there have been humans.

295
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:43,080
Certain yeasts in particular that live on our bodies have adapted so much that they can't

296
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:47,640
without us.

297
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:52,200
Neanderthal remains have been found with traces of penicillin producing moulds ground into

298
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:57,600
their teeth, thought to be a treatment for dental problems, in a practice similar to

299
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,600
that known from indigenous Australians and ancient Egyptians.

300
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:08,880
More recently, Otzi, the Iceman, the 5,000-year-old mummy found frozen in the ice of the Austro-Italian

301
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:15,520
Alps, carried with him pieces of the polypore fungus, which he likely used as tinder for

302
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:19,200
starting a fire.

303
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:24,720
Ink caps were used by medieval chroniclers to record words on parchment, and untold

304
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:30,120
amounts of edible mushrooms have been invaluable allies throughout history, despite being feared

305
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:34,160
and shunned in many cultures.

306
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:41,360
Eventually, penicillin would be rediscovered accidentally and isolated into a powerful

307
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:51,840
antimicrobial medicine, just in time to turn the tide of the Second World War.

308
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:59,000
Doubtless, we are at least part of our success as a species to the humble fungus.

309
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,080
And humans are far from the only organisms that benefit from the diverse capabilities

310
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,480
of the fungal kingdom.

311
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:10,480
As has become better understood for the last decade or so, the mycelial networks that spread

312
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:20,400
ubiquitously through forest floors all over the world do more than merely feed themselves.

313
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:29,400
They also act as a vital communication network for the plants in the forest.

314
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:34,360
It has been likened to a social network for the woodland, penetrating the roots of trees

315
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:42,240
and weaving them together and providing vital nutrients that support their growth.

316
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:47,240
Some scholars have gone so far as to liken this activity to trees talking to one another

317
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:54,680
via underground fungal webs.

318
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:59,440
Much more akin to cooperation, rather than competition.

319
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,880
For this, wood-wide web is capable of so much more.

320
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:09,600
It can transmit warnings between individual trees.

321
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:13,920
If one comes under insect attack, the fungal network beneath the ground carries the warning

322
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:22,480
to nearby vegetation, allowing them to mount a chemical defense before the threat arrives.

323
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:27,080
And in a strange altruistic tendency, carbon is moved from areas of abundance to those

324
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,520
of scarcity.

325
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:39,880
This is biological cooperation or symbiosis on the scale of entire ecosystems.

326
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:48,800
But fungi are also capable of collaborating on a much more individual and intimate level.

327
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:54,120
Carbon are strange, plant-like growth that can be found on rocky surfaces, man-made monuments

328
00:35:54,120 --> 00:36:01,720
and even certain slow-moving animals.

329
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:07,200
The crusted, scaly or feathered lifeforms are thought to encrust as much as 8% of the Earth's

330
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:14,760
surface, often in places where no other living thing can survive.

331
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:26,420
They can even withstand the freezing, desiccated and irradiated environment of space.

332
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:31,000
But lichens are not actually a single organism.

333
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:39,920
Rather they are an intimate symbiosis between photosynthesizing algae and fungus.

334
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:46,800
Many different species of algae and fungi can come together and lichenize, the specific

335
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:55,360
individuals determining the lichen's ultimate appearance and capabilities.

336
00:36:55,360 --> 00:37:00,320
Their relationship was actually one of the first symbioses to be described in the natural

337
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,320
world.

338
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:09,960
A Swiss botanist Simon Schrendener put forward his dual hypothesis of lichens in 1869.

339
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:15,520
In this, he posited that the fungi were enslaving parasites that had forced the photosynthetic

340
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:21,720
algae into service to reduce sugar and energy for them, albeit with the promise of harbour

341
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:24,320
and nutrients in return.

342
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:30,920
Today, however, we know the relationship between the two lichen partners to be much more equitable,

343
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:38,760
although the deeper scientists probe, the more complex the picture becomes.

344
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:45,320
In most lichens, there are more than two co-operating organisms, as several different fungal species

345
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:50,920
work together in a way that mutually benefits all parties.

346
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:59,880
Indeed, lichen scholars have yet to find how deep the symbiotic rabbit hole goes.

347
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:04,800
Together with algae and lichens, with trees in the wood-wide web, or with humanity in

348
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:14,720
modern civilisations, fungi have made themselves invaluable partners in many of Earth's ecosystems.

349
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:19,360
Their integration and interaction with nearly every living thing on the planet ultimately

350
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:26,400
blurs the line of where fungi end and everything else begins.

351
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:34,200
A collection of organisms, not just master and slave, not just individual singers, but

352
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:41,160
a song.

353
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:48,640
And so, tracing the origins of these remarkable organisms requires that we first understand

354
00:38:48,640 --> 00:39:02,000
exactly what they are.

355
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,440
Chernobyl, 1986

356
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:12,240
A catastrophic explosion at a nuclear plant in what is now northern Ukraine sees radioactive

357
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:17,320
waste spread across much of Europe.

358
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:22,000
For many kilometres around the leaking plant, contamination levels are high enough to cause

359
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:29,480
radiation poisoning and deadly cancers.

360
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:34,480
Inarguably the worst nuclear disaster the world has ever seen, a 10 square kilometre area

361
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:40,160
of the surrounding forest is killed outright by radioactive material amounting to 20 times

362
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:48,840
that of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

363
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:58,320
The region becomes known as the Red Forest, after the colour of its dead and dying trees.

364
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:08,680
Every animal that couldn't flee ultimately perishing from the overwhelming corruption.

365
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:14,240
After the disaster the Chernobyl plant itself was closed down, but the radioactive fuel

366
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,800
it still contained was left in situ.

367
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:22,280
In order to prevent any further reaction and to protect the immediate area from the effects

368
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:30,600
of radiation, the fuel is stored in huge vats of water.

369
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:37,920
The clear water itself glows with unearthly blue Cherenkov radiation, generated as the

370
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:46,760
decaying fuel splits water molecules, releasing energy in the form of light.

371
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:54,240
Only the water isn't clear anymore.

372
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:59,960
Over the years it has become blackened.

373
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:12,160
And the agent of this darkening is, remarkably, a fungus.

374
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:16,440
Many species of fungi are known to be extremer files.

375
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:20,440
They are able to tolerate conditions well beyond the limits of what we would consider

376
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,840
a comfortable existence.

377
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:30,600
Beyond such tolerance is the ability to withstand high levels of radioactivity.

378
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:36,240
The same levels that were enough to ravage the planets and animals of the Red Forest.

379
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:41,800
And so here, in the intensely radioactive waters of the abandoned Chernobyl plant, the

380
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:48,120
radio-resistant fungi have found a way to survive.

381
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:54,080
And more surprisingly, these hardy organisms seem to be doing more than merely surviving

382
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:57,080
here.

383
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:02,640
Scientists have found them growing towards the hot radioactive particles, and using the

384
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:08,360
energy from radioactive decay in much the same way as plants use the light energy from

385
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:12,320
the sun.

386
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:20,520
Despite unimaginable dangers, these fungal organisms have found a way to feed on radioactivity,

387
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:25,280
perhaps digging deep in their primordial genetic makeup to find a new niche in the wake of

388
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:29,080
radioactive devastation.

389
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:32,760
The discovery has staggering implications.

390
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:38,520
If a mushroom can adapt to eat nuclear waste, then surely other waste products can be consumed

391
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:49,960
too, perhaps most importantly, plastics.

392
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:55,240
The remarkable colonisers of Chernobyl comprise just a single variety among a staggering diversity

393
00:42:55,240 --> 00:43:03,720
of fungal species, with seemingly endless adaptations to a wide range of habitats,

394
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:08,000
lifestyles and symbiotic association.

395
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:14,320
There are single-celled yeasts, vast mycorrhizal networks, fungi that build mushrooms of every

396
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:19,960
conceivable shape and size, fungi that are cultured exclusively inside the nests of leaf

397
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:28,480
cutarans, fungi that live only on and in the human body, and not to mention the countless

398
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:37,440
lichenized forms hiding in plain sight.

399
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:43,480
Although only 150,000 species have been formally described, scientists estimate there may be

400
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:57,280
as many as 3.8 million species here on Earth, outnumbering plants by roughly 10 to 1.

401
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:04,600
They have been incredibly successful, and are incredibly old, 500 million years at the

402
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,360
very least.

403
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:12,040
If close enough in evolution, mycelium from some fungi can blend seamlessly with other

404
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:13,040
species.

405
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:19,760
Of course, given this cross-species breeding and being, fungi are almost the very definition

406
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:25,440
of other.

407
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:34,440
The polyphonic way they experience the world is immensely different to our monophony.

408
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:40,760
With so much diversity, it can become difficult to identify the features that unite fungi,

409
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:44,600
rather than set them apart from one another.

410
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:50,000
One mycological idea is that we should abandon dividing them into species altogether, due

411
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:59,560
to the inadequate categorizations given to them for hundreds, if not thousands of years.

412
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:05,080
Thought to be merely parasites until very recently, for influential Swedish botanist Carl

413
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:09,360
Linnaeus, they were chaos incarnate.

414
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:14,640
Others genuinely thought them caused by lightning strikes.

415
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:19,520
By the 19th century, they were categorized as plants, and only in the mid-1960s were

416
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:30,120
they granted an entire kingdom of their own, for in reality, fungi are closer to animals.

417
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:34,800
They are eukaryotes, set apart from their bacterial cousins through the presence of a

418
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:41,360
nucleus and other membrane-bound machinery inside their cells.

419
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:46,120
They lack the photosynthetic chloroplasts that plants possess, and despite being historically

420
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:51,040
grouped among plants on account of their vegetative lifestyle, fungi actually share

421
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,320
more in common with animals than with any other kingdom.

422
00:45:54,320 --> 00:46:00,320
Indeed, many fungi contain the same light-sensitive pigments as can be found in our own eyes,

423
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:04,720
and their compatible biochemistry is what makes them such potent allies in the field

424
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:08,840
of human medicine.

425
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:13,560
Together with animals and single-celled protists, the fungi are part of a larger group, known

426
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:18,640
as epistakons, but justify their own kingdom through the possession of unique features shared

427
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:24,680
by neither animal or protist.

428
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:32,160
They are defined in part by their unique mode of growth, from probing hyphal tips, and the

429
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:37,680
ability of these hyphae to digest their food outside the fungal body rather than an internal

430
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,960
stomach.

431
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:47,840
Typically, hyphae can be recognized by their ability to branch, often at right angles and

432
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:53,720
to converge and fuse again further down the line.

433
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:57,960
And fungal cells, regardless of their habitat, are all strengthened by a specific kind of

434
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:02,480
biological polymer, known as chitin.

435
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:06,080
Some animals also make use of chitin for protection.

436
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:12,520
This is especially common in the ecosystems of arthropods like insects and crabs.

437
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:18,160
But only in fungi is it ubiquitous around each and every cell.

438
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:23,720
This toolkit of classifying features allows paleontologists to trace the fungal kingdom

439
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:32,800
back through the mists of time, and to begin to search for the origins of fungi on Earth.

440
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:38,160
That is the uniquely hyphal microstructure found in fossil specimens of proto-taxities

441
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:43,840
that best supports its fungal interpretation.

442
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:49,800
But an absence of corroborating biochemistry makes the conclusion of giant fungi 470 million

443
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:53,160
years ago a somewhat tentative one.

444
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:59,520
Instead, paleontologists consider the oldest uncontested fungal fossils to be those preserved

445
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:07,240
in intricate cellular detail in the 410 million-year-old glassy shirts of Reiny, Scotland.

446
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:14,600
Here, a wide diversity of fungal types are preserved as if in crystal-clear resin, painting

447
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:20,480
a picture of a terrestrial Devonian world in which fungi have already found and exploited

448
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,440
many of their modern-day niches.

449
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:28,840
These specimens are by no means the first of their kind, appearing as they do already

450
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:35,520
adapted to their chosen lifestyles.

451
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:42,360
But they do serve an important purpose in modern paleontological analysis.

452
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:47,320
Genetic and physiological analysis of fungi alive today allow them to be plotted onto an

453
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:54,360
evolutionary family tree, with more recently derived species forming the most distant twigs

454
00:48:54,360 --> 00:49:02,880
and more ancestral forms branching closer to the root.

455
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:07,120
Finding and plotting the fossil specimens onto this family tree helps to orient those

456
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:14,800
relationships in time as well as in evolutionary space, and to calibrate estimates on the rate

457
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:20,560
of fungal evolution on the basis of genetic transformation.

458
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:26,080
Using these statistical tools, modern paleontologists have estimated that the origins of the fungal

459
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:32,280
kingdom extend back long before the age of giant proto-taxities.

460
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:41,520
Indeed, they suggest that we should be searching for the first fungi back in the Neo-proto-Rzoic

461
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:50,400
between 1,750 million years ago, before even plants or animals have made a definitive appearance.

462
00:49:50,400 --> 00:50:01,720
Long before the green abundance of the Devonian, when the terrestrial earth was still a wasteland.

463
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:08,560
With no soil to speak of, all nutrients trapped within rocks, it seems at least possible that

464
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:13,900
algae and fungus made it onto the land together.

465
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:19,840
Like the aftermath of Chernobyl and countless mass extinction events before, early pioneers

466
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:41,360
leading the way for more life to follow.

467
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:45,800
Just outside the thriving city of Mbunji Mai in the heart of the Democratic Republic of

468
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:57,960
Congo, rolling tropical grasslands are pushed aside by the inexorable advance of industry.

469
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:02,920
Ever since the discovery of diamonds here in 1909, the gentle hillsides have been torn

470
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:08,400
open, exposing wounds of bright red soil and filling the rivers with the same blood red

471
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:11,400
silt.

472
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:18,720
Today, though one of the most troubled regions on the planet, the area supplies some 10%

473
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:22,360
of the world's diamonds.

474
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:27,760
Respecting geologists continue to search for more in the ancient rocks beneath the surface,

475
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:32,520
there is no other material like it.

476
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:38,320
In the absence of any great mountains or sharp rocky escarpments in this part of the country,

477
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:42,920
geologists must actively drill down into the rocks beneath their feet.

478
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:48,560
And one such drill core, not far from the bustle of the DRC's second city, has revealed

479
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:55,200
hidden treasures, although not the kind that will bring economic geologists running.

480
00:51:55,200 --> 00:52:01,800
The Kanshi B-13 core penetrates limestone and shaley rocks that are neoproterozoic in

481
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:08,440
age, and which were likely deposited in a warm perennial lake.

482
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:16,720
Here, as in so many rocks of this age, paleontologists have found spherical microfossils that are

483
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:22,040
thought to belong to primitive eukaryotic algae.

484
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:30,280
But at a depth of more than 100 meters, the extracted core contains something else, something

485
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:37,000
much more remarkable for the time.

486
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:43,800
In a layer aged between 810 and 715 million years old, an international team of scientists

487
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:49,640
have identified curious filamentous fossils preserved in three dimensions by crystalline

488
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:54,880
limestone.

489
00:52:54,880 --> 00:53:00,440
Each filament is less than 10 microns, 100th of a millimetre across and up to a millimetre

490
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:04,720
in length.

491
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:12,120
But together they pack densely into an interconnected mesh of branching and fusing strands.

492
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:22,640
In shape and arrangement alone, they are surprisingly similar to the hyphae of modern mycelial network.

493
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:30,640
But at an age almost double that of the oldest confirmed fungi, it will take more than morphology

494
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:36,400
to make a case for these supposed neoproterozoic fungi.

495
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:43,000
Fortunately, these filaments are preserved in such a way that allow scientists to search

496
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:48,800
for other strengthening strands of evidence to support the fungal conclusion.

497
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:53,440
Using a technique called Raman spectroscopy, which uses laser light to reveal the nature

498
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:59,000
of chemical bonds in a structure, they found the filaments to be composed of organic material

499
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:06,440
that had undergone the same heating and compression as the surrounding rock.

500
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:11,160
This implies that they are just as ancient as the limestone that surrounds them, and

501
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:15,000
not the result of some secondary infiltration.

502
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,240
Next, the researchers employed a kind of chemical straining that's typically used

503
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:23,800
to identify fungi in modern soils.

504
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:29,080
The stain clings to the chitin that uniquely makes up fungal cell walls and not to anything

505
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:36,920
else, causing the fungal members of the community to glow green under specific microscopic light.

506
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:42,400
And sure enough, when the fossil filaments were treated with the stain, they glowed the

507
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:50,320
characteristic green, suggesting that chitin was a significant part of their original organic structure.

508
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:59,040
These multiple lines of evidence from morphology to chemical composition are necessary to substantiate

509
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:06,120
what is ultimately a remarkable claim, that recognizable fungal mycelia had already evolved

510
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:12,960
at least 715 million years ago.

511
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:17,680
This mycelium would have lived within the sediment, just under the water or at the shore of the

512
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:25,600
neoprotozoic lake, feeding on decaying organic matter from algae and bacteria.

513
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:31,640
It is a lifestyle almost identical to that of many mycelia today, and these fossils suggest

514
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:40,280
it has an origin deeper in the past than we might imagine, but even these are not the

515
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:46,000
oldest fungal candidates found to date.

516
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,400
In the far north of the Canadian Northwest Territories, on the desolate frosted shores

517
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:58,240
of the Arctic Ocean, dark-coloured shales have been dated to around 1 billion years old,

518
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:05,360
around 2 or 300 million years older than the limestones of the DRC.

519
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:12,040
Here, traditional micro paleontological methods, which involve dissolving away the solid rock

520
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:17,200
to leave behind the organic material trapped within, has yielded micro fossils with a unique

521
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:23,000
shape and structure that hints at a fungal affinity.

522
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:27,080
Large spheres between 3 and 8 hundredths of a millimetre across are attached to narrow

523
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:33,160
filaments which branch at right angles to one another.

524
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:36,880
Researchers have interpreted these structures as the reproductive spores and connective

525
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:41,960
hyphae of fungi.

526
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:47,320
And while the wealth of analytical data is not as great as the younger African specimens,

527
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:51,920
chemical analysis of these Canadian examples does seem to suggest the presence of fungal

528
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:57,880
chitin within the walls as well.

529
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:02,200
Although these conclusions are more tentative, the possible appearance of already distinct

530
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:07,480
fungal structures at this earlier point in time does seem to be honing in on the earliest

531
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:15,040
origins of the fungal kingdom.

532
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:20,480
Elsewhere around the world, fossils reveal some of the earliest possible holozoans,

533
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:23,920
their precursors to true animals.

534
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:27,520
That the fossil evidence of fungi seems to be consistent with genetic estimates of their

535
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:33,000
appearance too, helps to build a picture of microbial diversity at the very beginning

536
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:39,560
of the neoproterozoic, perhaps due in part to the stability and worldwide strife of the

537
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:42,560
boring billion.

538
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:49,480
This then could be the age where our ancestors and the fungi went their separate ways, diverging

539
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:55,880
on very different evolutionary paths.

540
00:57:55,880 --> 00:58:03,600
However, there is one more fungal fossil candidate, which seems to blow this neatly

541
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:08,520
converging picture apart.

542
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:14,440
In 2017, paleontologists from Sweden and Australia found structures inside the bubbles of ancient

543
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:24,120
lava flows that also seem to show a curiously fungal habit.

544
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:33,240
The key difference is that these samples from South Africa are 2.4 billion years old.

545
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:37,080
Inside these basaltic bubbles, which form naturally as gases attempt to escape through

546
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:42,880
sticky liquid magma, the researchers have found filaments, the typical dimensions of

547
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:51,040
fungal hyphae, which branch and fuse in a compellingly mycelial way.

548
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:55,800
The morphology argument may be strong, but the unique preservation and extreme antiquity

549
00:58:55,800 --> 00:59:04,400
of these specimens renders any supporting chemical analysis impossible.

550
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:08,400
And at more than a billion years older than when the fungal genome is thought to have

551
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:14,920
The fungal interpretation is perhaps too extraordinary a claim.

552
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:19,880
Yet even if they are not true fungi as we have come to define them, there is no denying

553
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:25,280
the mycelial habit.

554
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:30,520
Perhaps more primitive organisms, whether bacteria or some of the first eukaryotes,

555
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:37,320
experimented with a mesh-like mycelium long before the fungal kingdom made it their own.

556
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:43,640
All of these ancient fungal and mycelial discoveries have been made within the last 5 years, highlighting

557
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:51,160
just how immature the science of fungal paleontology is, much like mycology in general, which hovers

558
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:55,040
awkwardly somewhere between plant and animal studies.

559
00:59:55,040 --> 01:00:00,920
Indeed, it is only in the last few decades that ecologists have come to realize the staggering

560
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:06,840
diversity and vital importance of fungi in modern ecosystems.

561
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:11,200
Catching glimpses of them within the fossil record, whether in their monumental success

562
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:17,400
as Devonian proto-taxities, their understated diversity in the rhiney-chert, or in their

563
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:25,240
earliest microbial manifestations in the neoprotozoic, reveals just how influential fungi have been

564
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:28,840
through much of life's history.

565
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:33,760
They have played a crucial role in cycling nutrients and shaping ecosystems for much

566
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:36,680
longer than we may have imagined.

567
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:41,920
Perhaps creating soil in the first place, and certainly keeping it healthy for other

568
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:44,680
forms of life.

569
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:49,760
It is very likely that it was fungi that supported and enabled the success of other kingdoms

570
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:56,520
of life throughout the neoprotozoic and beyond, just as it was fungi who facilitated the colonization

571
01:00:56,520 --> 01:01:00,520
of land some 450 million years ago.

572
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:09,520
As well as the re-colonization of blasted landscapes after mass extinction events.

573
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:20,520
For as much as a billion years or more, it seems, everywhere life seeks to explore,

574
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:26,520
fungi have been one step ahead, preparing the way.

575
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:38,520
And with the development of so-called mycotechture, being investigated for space travel and habitation,

576
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:43,520
it is a role that may just continue long into the future.

577
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:50,520
