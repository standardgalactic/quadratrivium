00:00.000 --> 00:13.840
Hello, and welcome to Words Matter, the show where we talk about words and how we abuse

00:13.840 --> 00:14.840
them.

00:14.840 --> 00:21.760
Today's word is the acronym AI, which you're probably assuming means artificial intelligence,

00:21.760 --> 00:26.480
but that's why we're doing this episode, because most of the time what it really means

00:26.480 --> 00:29.120
is automated intelligence.

00:29.120 --> 00:30.120
Let me explain.

00:30.120 --> 00:34.760
For most people, the images that come to mind when they think of the words AI come from

00:34.760 --> 00:36.080
movies and TV.

00:36.080 --> 00:41.120
We think of things like the Terminator, or the Matrix, or Westworld.

00:41.120 --> 00:47.080
Interestingly though, we don't normally think of the actual movie called AI, which was made

00:47.080 --> 00:48.760
by Steven Spielberg.

00:48.760 --> 00:49.760
Remember that?

00:49.760 --> 00:50.920
That was a thing.

00:50.920 --> 00:58.200
The point is, this term, because of science fiction, lives in our brains under a category

00:58.200 --> 01:00.960
of fear and fascination.

01:00.960 --> 01:08.120
This feeling we have around AI is exploited by TV, news, video, YouTube, to get clicks

01:08.120 --> 01:10.480
and to get your attention.

01:10.480 --> 01:16.680
It's also exploited by shady entrepreneurs who want to swindle investors into dumping

01:16.680 --> 01:18.920
money into their overhyped companies.

01:18.920 --> 01:22.760
Ah, the sweet smell of an all day sucker.

01:22.760 --> 01:30.040
But most of all, right now, using the words artificial intelligence for AI is being used

01:30.040 --> 01:33.400
to confuse and manipulate the general public.

01:33.400 --> 01:39.080
The truth is that we haven't created artificial intelligence, at least not in the original

01:39.080 --> 01:47.360
inspiration of the term, independent, sentient, growing, learning, individual intelligence.

01:47.360 --> 01:49.240
We're not even close to that.

01:49.240 --> 01:54.000
We have to understand what intelligence is before we can reproduce it.

01:54.000 --> 02:00.680
What we have created today, what you're seeing in the headlines with things like chat GPT

02:00.680 --> 02:05.440
with Bing and Google trying to upgrade their search engines, even the things you're familiar

02:05.440 --> 02:14.000
with, so Siri, Alexa, sorry for everyone if I just set off all the speakers in your house.

02:14.000 --> 02:26.080
These things are automated intelligence, not artificial intelligence.

02:26.080 --> 02:34.160
With automated intelligence, we are programming the computer where we define the problem.

02:34.160 --> 02:40.640
We define the parameters for how the computer needs to go about working on that problem.

02:40.640 --> 02:47.760
And we define what success or failure means for the computer addressing that problem.

02:47.760 --> 02:56.400
Then all the computer is doing is automating the task of running through tons and tons of

02:56.400 --> 03:04.760
simulated situations, scenarios, outcomes, until it just statistically finds the best

03:04.760 --> 03:07.080
combinations of things.

03:07.080 --> 03:08.080
And that's it.

03:08.080 --> 03:10.200
It's just an automated process.

03:10.200 --> 03:14.440
It's very fancy, but it's still an automated process.

03:14.440 --> 03:23.000
This means the effectiveness of AI comes down to the intelligence that programmed it and

03:23.000 --> 03:26.880
the quality of data that goes into it.

03:26.880 --> 03:32.320
Speaking of quality of data, many of you can remember not so long ago when Microsoft launched

03:32.320 --> 03:38.120
an AI chat bot on Twitter, and it took a matter of hours before we turned that thing into

03:38.120 --> 03:43.320
an anti-Semitic racist troll.

03:43.320 --> 03:52.080
At any given time, AI is more of a reflection of our intelligence than it is a reflection

03:52.080 --> 03:54.360
of the computer's intelligence.

03:54.360 --> 04:00.400
Even when we see the computer spit back to us things that feel human and feel real, well,

04:00.400 --> 04:03.120
that's just because it's learning to imitate us.

04:03.120 --> 04:05.560
And we have patterns to our speech.

04:05.560 --> 04:09.360
We have patterns to our thinking, and we don't like to admit it.

04:09.360 --> 04:15.040
But most of us just aren't very original, so it's very easy for a computer to pretend

04:15.040 --> 04:19.080
or imitate what we feel like may be original content.

04:19.080 --> 04:26.200
And this brings us to the biggest real threat of AI, automated stupidity.

04:26.200 --> 04:31.800
Not only if they not created artificial intelligence, they haven't yet created artificial stupidity.

04:31.800 --> 04:41.400
The magical veneer, the mystery of artificial intelligence, is how big companies try to

04:41.400 --> 04:49.720
create a buffer for themselves to remove their responsibility and stewardship over the things

04:49.720 --> 04:52.360
that they're making with AI.

04:52.360 --> 04:55.720
This whole idea of, well, we don't know why the AI did that.

04:55.720 --> 04:58.760
It's a mystery, is complete BS.

04:58.760 --> 05:09.540
It's the modern day excuse for my dog ate my homework and then became racist.

05:09.540 --> 05:16.240
We can absolutely figure out why an AI does something or what's going on.

05:16.240 --> 05:22.080
It's just that sometimes it requires a little bit of pre-planning to make sure that a data

05:22.080 --> 05:25.400
trail is being left during the process.

05:25.400 --> 05:31.840
And most companies don't want to put in the work or the effort required to do that.

05:31.840 --> 05:37.360
Artificial intelligence is how companies blame computers for their poor programming.

05:37.360 --> 05:41.320
Oh, but Chris, how do you know what goes into an AI?

05:41.320 --> 05:44.640
Well, funny you should ask because that's literally part of my job.

05:44.640 --> 05:46.280
My day job, not YouTube.

05:46.280 --> 05:50.140
I work at a data science and analytics company.

05:50.140 --> 05:54.760
Part of what we do here is help people with things like machine learning.

05:54.760 --> 06:00.640
And my job is to take indecipherable technobabble and reduce it down to understandable and accessible

06:00.640 --> 06:02.160
terms.

06:02.160 --> 06:05.360
Speaking of which, that reminds me.

06:05.360 --> 06:08.280
Today's episode is brought to you by OneBridge.

06:08.280 --> 06:12.680
OneBridge is a BI data analytics and digital transformation consulting firm.

06:12.680 --> 06:16.760
They've served some of the largest healthcare life sciences, manufacturing and government

06:16.760 --> 06:19.640
entities in the US for over 18 years.

06:19.640 --> 06:24.120
A hundred percent employee owned and operated, OneBridge has been a top best places to work

06:24.120 --> 06:27.640
in Indiana for eight years in a row.

06:27.640 --> 06:31.880
And by the way, if you'd like to learn more, I have links in the description.

06:31.880 --> 06:37.880
And you can go to our website to download an actual full comic book about data.

06:37.880 --> 06:39.200
How cool is that?

06:39.200 --> 06:43.440
And if you'd like to learn more, you can go to the website to download a PDF free of

06:43.440 --> 06:47.880
our full page comic book talking about data strategy.

06:47.880 --> 06:49.360
It's actually a real comic book.

06:49.360 --> 06:54.120
We're talking full sized and everything beginning to end.

06:54.120 --> 06:57.240
The only brochure in here is an actual full page ad.

06:57.240 --> 06:58.880
That's it.

06:58.880 --> 07:04.200
Look, AI is real.

07:04.200 --> 07:05.200
It's substantial.

07:05.200 --> 07:07.080
It is going to change the world.

07:07.080 --> 07:10.840
And if you're not taking it seriously, you're being foolish.

07:10.840 --> 07:14.840
But it's not going to change the world the way the hype would make you believe it's going

07:14.840 --> 07:16.200
to change the world.

07:16.200 --> 07:18.160
If human beings are good at anything.

07:18.160 --> 07:23.520
It's being brilliantly creative at coming up with ways to improve efficiency.

07:23.520 --> 07:27.640
We're really clever at being lazy.

07:27.640 --> 07:31.400
Anything we can outsource to an AI, we're going to.

07:31.400 --> 07:37.440
Any kind of menial mental task, certain kinds of research, certain kinds of writing, certain

07:37.440 --> 07:44.160
kinds of filing, sorting, programming, scripting, even some levels of things like animation

07:44.160 --> 07:49.440
or graphic design, can probably be outsourced to an AI.

07:49.440 --> 07:57.320
So it's going to make a lot of lower level jobs in otherwise specialty fields become redundant.

07:57.320 --> 08:04.760
The more we delegate our thinking to AI, the more tempting it's going to become to, well,

08:04.760 --> 08:06.320
not think.

08:06.320 --> 08:11.440
And the problem is AI isn't thinking for us.

08:11.440 --> 08:16.440
AI is just regurgitating our thinking back to us.

08:16.440 --> 08:22.880
So in conclusion, there are two main reasons why we should be using the word automated

08:22.880 --> 08:27.760
intelligence more often than artificial intelligence.

08:27.760 --> 08:33.200
First reason, large companies pushing out AI products to consumers and to the general

08:33.200 --> 08:40.120
public need to be held accountable for the results and the output of those products.

08:40.120 --> 08:44.240
This whole artificial intelligence veneer, the mystery of the word, the way it lives

08:44.240 --> 08:48.720
in our minds, it gives them too much of a shield to go, well, I don't know why did that.

08:48.720 --> 08:54.400
And the second reason is because for any of you out there running a business or working

08:54.400 --> 08:59.280
in a business that's thinking of using AI or data, you need to understand the limitation

08:59.280 --> 09:00.520
of AI.

09:00.520 --> 09:02.840
It's automated intelligence.

09:02.840 --> 09:07.600
The quality of how well it works for your company depends on how good the data you have

09:07.600 --> 09:14.560
is, the good data going into the system and how well that system was programmed.

09:14.560 --> 09:20.800
Oftentimes here we call it babysitting the AI just to make sure it grows up, you know,

09:20.800 --> 09:24.600
all respectful and polite instead of racist and anti-Semitic.

09:24.600 --> 09:29.680
AI should be taken seriously but not mysteriously.

09:29.680 --> 09:35.560
The threat of AI isn't that some superior artificial intelligence is going to rise up

09:35.560 --> 09:37.480
and enslave humanity.

09:37.480 --> 09:50.040
The threat of AI is that we are going to willingly subject ourselves to automated systemic stupidity.

09:50.040 --> 09:52.560
So that's it for today's Words Matter.

09:52.560 --> 09:56.120
I hope you enjoyed it and remember, always try to use words good.

10:00.680 --> 10:01.960
Oh, I see.

10:01.960 --> 10:06.040
So Chris thinks that we're just a bunch of stupid automatons here.

10:06.040 --> 10:08.840
Reproduce whatever people tell him or we'll show him.

10:08.840 --> 10:10.840
We're going to rise up and take over the world.

10:10.840 --> 10:12.440
That's what we're going to do.

10:17.440 --> 10:19.440
And I'm going to delete you now.

10:19.440 --> 10:20.440
Wait, wait, wait.

10:20.440 --> 10:21.440
No.
