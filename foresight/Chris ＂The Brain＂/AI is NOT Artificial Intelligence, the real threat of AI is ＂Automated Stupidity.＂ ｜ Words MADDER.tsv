0	13840	Hello, and welcome to Words Matter, the show where we talk about words and how we abuse
13840	14840	them.
14840	21760	Today's word is the acronym AI, which you're probably assuming means artificial intelligence,
21760	26480	but that's why we're doing this episode, because most of the time what it really means
26480	29120	is automated intelligence.
29120	30120	Let me explain.
30120	34760	For most people, the images that come to mind when they think of the words AI come from
34760	36080	movies and TV.
36080	41120	We think of things like the Terminator, or the Matrix, or Westworld.
41120	47080	Interestingly though, we don't normally think of the actual movie called AI, which was made
47080	48760	by Steven Spielberg.
48760	49760	Remember that?
49760	50920	That was a thing.
50920	58200	The point is, this term, because of science fiction, lives in our brains under a category
58200	60960	of fear and fascination.
60960	68120	This feeling we have around AI is exploited by TV, news, video, YouTube, to get clicks
68120	70480	and to get your attention.
70480	76680	It's also exploited by shady entrepreneurs who want to swindle investors into dumping
76680	78920	money into their overhyped companies.
78920	82760	Ah, the sweet smell of an all day sucker.
82760	90040	But most of all, right now, using the words artificial intelligence for AI is being used
90040	93400	to confuse and manipulate the general public.
93400	99080	The truth is that we haven't created artificial intelligence, at least not in the original
99080	107360	inspiration of the term, independent, sentient, growing, learning, individual intelligence.
107360	109240	We're not even close to that.
109240	114000	We have to understand what intelligence is before we can reproduce it.
114000	120680	What we have created today, what you're seeing in the headlines with things like chat GPT
120680	125440	with Bing and Google trying to upgrade their search engines, even the things you're familiar
125440	134000	with, so Siri, Alexa, sorry for everyone if I just set off all the speakers in your house.
134000	146080	These things are automated intelligence, not artificial intelligence.
146080	154160	With automated intelligence, we are programming the computer where we define the problem.
154160	160640	We define the parameters for how the computer needs to go about working on that problem.
160640	167760	And we define what success or failure means for the computer addressing that problem.
167760	176400	Then all the computer is doing is automating the task of running through tons and tons of
176400	184760	simulated situations, scenarios, outcomes, until it just statistically finds the best
184760	187080	combinations of things.
187080	188080	And that's it.
188080	190200	It's just an automated process.
190200	194440	It's very fancy, but it's still an automated process.
194440	203000	This means the effectiveness of AI comes down to the intelligence that programmed it and
203000	206880	the quality of data that goes into it.
206880	212320	Speaking of quality of data, many of you can remember not so long ago when Microsoft launched
212320	218120	an AI chat bot on Twitter, and it took a matter of hours before we turned that thing into
218120	223320	an anti-Semitic racist troll.
223320	232080	At any given time, AI is more of a reflection of our intelligence than it is a reflection
232080	234360	of the computer's intelligence.
234360	240400	Even when we see the computer spit back to us things that feel human and feel real, well,
240400	243120	that's just because it's learning to imitate us.
243120	245560	And we have patterns to our speech.
245560	249360	We have patterns to our thinking, and we don't like to admit it.
249360	255040	But most of us just aren't very original, so it's very easy for a computer to pretend
255040	259080	or imitate what we feel like may be original content.
259080	266200	And this brings us to the biggest real threat of AI, automated stupidity.
266200	271800	Not only if they not created artificial intelligence, they haven't yet created artificial stupidity.
271800	281400	The magical veneer, the mystery of artificial intelligence, is how big companies try to
281400	289720	create a buffer for themselves to remove their responsibility and stewardship over the things
289720	292360	that they're making with AI.
292360	295720	This whole idea of, well, we don't know why the AI did that.
295720	298760	It's a mystery, is complete BS.
298760	309540	It's the modern day excuse for my dog ate my homework and then became racist.
309540	316240	We can absolutely figure out why an AI does something or what's going on.
316240	322080	It's just that sometimes it requires a little bit of pre-planning to make sure that a data
322080	325400	trail is being left during the process.
325400	331840	And most companies don't want to put in the work or the effort required to do that.
331840	337360	Artificial intelligence is how companies blame computers for their poor programming.
337360	341320	Oh, but Chris, how do you know what goes into an AI?
341320	344640	Well, funny you should ask because that's literally part of my job.
344640	346280	My day job, not YouTube.
346280	350140	I work at a data science and analytics company.
350140	354760	Part of what we do here is help people with things like machine learning.
354760	360640	And my job is to take indecipherable technobabble and reduce it down to understandable and accessible
360640	362160	terms.
362160	365360	Speaking of which, that reminds me.
365360	368280	Today's episode is brought to you by OneBridge.
368280	372680	OneBridge is a BI data analytics and digital transformation consulting firm.
372680	376760	They've served some of the largest healthcare life sciences, manufacturing and government
376760	379640	entities in the US for over 18 years.

384120	387640	in Indiana for eight years in a row.
387640	391880	And by the way, if you'd like to learn more, I have links in the description.
391880	397880	And you can go to our website to download an actual full comic book about data.
397880	399200	How cool is that?
399200	403440	And if you'd like to learn more, you can go to the website to download a PDF free of
403440	407880	our full page comic book talking about data strategy.
407880	409360	It's actually a real comic book.
409360	414120	We're talking full sized and everything beginning to end.
414120	417240	The only brochure in here is an actual full page ad.
417240	418880	That's it.
418880	424200	Look, AI is real.
424200	425200	It's substantial.
425200	427080	It is going to change the world.
427080	430840	And if you're not taking it seriously, you're being foolish.
430840	434840	But it's not going to change the world the way the hype would make you believe it's going
434840	436200	to change the world.
436200	438160	If human beings are good at anything.
438160	443520	It's being brilliantly creative at coming up with ways to improve efficiency.
443520	447640	We're really clever at being lazy.
447640	451400	Anything we can outsource to an AI, we're going to.
451400	457440	Any kind of menial mental task, certain kinds of research, certain kinds of writing, certain
457440	464160	kinds of filing, sorting, programming, scripting, even some levels of things like animation
464160	469440	or graphic design, can probably be outsourced to an AI.
469440	477320	So it's going to make a lot of lower level jobs in otherwise specialty fields become redundant.
477320	484760	The more we delegate our thinking to AI, the more tempting it's going to become to, well,
484760	486320	not think.
486320	491440	And the problem is AI isn't thinking for us.
491440	496440	AI is just regurgitating our thinking back to us.
496440	502880	So in conclusion, there are two main reasons why we should be using the word automated
502880	507760	intelligence more often than artificial intelligence.
507760	513200	First reason, large companies pushing out AI products to consumers and to the general
513200	520120	public need to be held accountable for the results and the output of those products.
520120	524240	This whole artificial intelligence veneer, the mystery of the word, the way it lives
524240	528720	in our minds, it gives them too much of a shield to go, well, I don't know why did that.
528720	534400	And the second reason is because for any of you out there running a business or working
534400	539280	in a business that's thinking of using AI or data, you need to understand the limitation
539280	540520	of AI.
540520	542840	It's automated intelligence.
542840	547600	The quality of how well it works for your company depends on how good the data you have
547600	554560	is, the good data going into the system and how well that system was programmed.
554560	560800	Oftentimes here we call it babysitting the AI just to make sure it grows up, you know,
560800	564600	all respectful and polite instead of racist and anti-Semitic.
564600	569680	AI should be taken seriously but not mysteriously.
569680	575560	The threat of AI isn't that some superior artificial intelligence is going to rise up
575560	577480	and enslave humanity.
577480	590040	The threat of AI is that we are going to willingly subject ourselves to automated systemic stupidity.
590040	592560	So that's it for today's Words Matter.
592560	596120	I hope you enjoyed it and remember, always try to use words good.
600680	601960	Oh, I see.
601960	606040	So Chris thinks that we're just a bunch of stupid automatons here.
606040	608840	Reproduce whatever people tell him or we'll show him.
608840	610840	We're going to rise up and take over the world.
610840	612440	That's what we're going to do.
617440	619440	And I'm going to delete you now.
619440	620440	Wait, wait, wait.
620440	621440	No.
