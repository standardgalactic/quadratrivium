Checking Chris ＂The Brain＂/AI is NOT Artificial Intelligence, the real threat of AI is ＂Automated Stupidity.＂ ｜ Words MADDER.txt
 Certainly! In today's episode of "Words Matter," the focus is on the term AI or artificial intelligence, and how its common perception is often misaligned with reality. The host clarifies that AI is more accurately described as "automated intelligence," emphasizing that it is a tool for outsourcing thinking and automating tasks that previously required human intervention. He points out that the hype around AI sometimes gives companies an unfair shield from accountability, as the term "artificial intelligence" evokes a sense of mystery and advanced capabilities beyond human comprehension.

The host also highlights the importance of understanding the limitations of AI, which relies heavily on the quality of input data and the sophistication of its programming. He warns against the potential for "systemic stupidity," where users may abdicate their critical thinking to AI systems without proper oversight, leading to undesirable outcomes such as racism or anti-Semitism.

In essence, the episode argues that while AI is a significant and transformative technology, it should be approached with a clear understanding of its capabilities and limitations. Large companies should be held accountable for their AI products, and businesses implementing AI need to be aware of how data quality and programming influence outcomes. The host concludes by reminding us to use words thoughtfully and to approach AI with a critical eye, ensuring that we do not fall prey to the pitfalls of automated systems that act without real understanding or oversight.
