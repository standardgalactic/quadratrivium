00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,840
Hello, and welcome to Words Matter, the show where we talk about words and how we abuse

2
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:14,840
them.

3
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:21,760
Today's word is the acronym AI, which you're probably assuming means artificial intelligence,

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,480
but that's why we're doing this episode, because most of the time what it really means

5
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,120
is automated intelligence.

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,120
Let me explain.

7
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:34,760
For most people, the images that come to mind when they think of the words AI come from

8
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,080
movies and TV.

9
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:41,120
We think of things like the Terminator, or the Matrix, or Westworld.

10
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:47,080
Interestingly though, we don't normally think of the actual movie called AI, which was made

11
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,760
by Steven Spielberg.

12
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:49,760
Remember that?

13
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,920
That was a thing.

14
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:58,200
The point is, this term, because of science fiction, lives in our brains under a category

15
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,960
of fear and fascination.

16
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:08,120
This feeling we have around AI is exploited by TV, news, video, YouTube, to get clicks

17
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,480
and to get your attention.

18
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:16,680
It's also exploited by shady entrepreneurs who want to swindle investors into dumping

19
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,920
money into their overhyped companies.

20
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,760
Ah, the sweet smell of an all day sucker.

21
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:30,040
But most of all, right now, using the words artificial intelligence for AI is being used

22
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,400
to confuse and manipulate the general public.

23
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:39,080
The truth is that we haven't created artificial intelligence, at least not in the original

24
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:47,360
inspiration of the term, independent, sentient, growing, learning, individual intelligence.

25
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,240
We're not even close to that.

26
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:54,000
We have to understand what intelligence is before we can reproduce it.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,680
What we have created today, what you're seeing in the headlines with things like chat GPT

28
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,440
with Bing and Google trying to upgrade their search engines, even the things you're familiar

29
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:14,000
with, so Siri, Alexa, sorry for everyone if I just set off all the speakers in your house.

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:26,080
These things are automated intelligence, not artificial intelligence.

31
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:34,160
With automated intelligence, we are programming the computer where we define the problem.

32
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:40,640
We define the parameters for how the computer needs to go about working on that problem.

33
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:47,760
And we define what success or failure means for the computer addressing that problem.

34
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:56,400
Then all the computer is doing is automating the task of running through tons and tons of

35
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:04,760
simulated situations, scenarios, outcomes, until it just statistically finds the best

36
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,080
combinations of things.

37
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,080
And that's it.

38
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,200
It's just an automated process.

39
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,440
It's very fancy, but it's still an automated process.

40
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:23,000
This means the effectiveness of AI comes down to the intelligence that programmed it and

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,880
the quality of data that goes into it.

42
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:32,320
Speaking of quality of data, many of you can remember not so long ago when Microsoft launched

43
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:38,120
an AI chat bot on Twitter, and it took a matter of hours before we turned that thing into

44
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:43,320
an anti-Semitic racist troll.

45
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:52,080
At any given time, AI is more of a reflection of our intelligence than it is a reflection

46
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,360
of the computer's intelligence.

47
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:00,400
Even when we see the computer spit back to us things that feel human and feel real, well,

48
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,120
that's just because it's learning to imitate us.

49
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,560
And we have patterns to our speech.

50
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,360
We have patterns to our thinking, and we don't like to admit it.

51
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:15,040
But most of us just aren't very original, so it's very easy for a computer to pretend

52
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,080
or imitate what we feel like may be original content.

53
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:26,200
And this brings us to the biggest real threat of AI, automated stupidity.

54
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:31,800
Not only if they not created artificial intelligence, they haven't yet created artificial stupidity.

55
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:41,400
The magical veneer, the mystery of artificial intelligence, is how big companies try to

56
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:49,720
create a buffer for themselves to remove their responsibility and stewardship over the things

57
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,360
that they're making with AI.

58
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,720
This whole idea of, well, we don't know why the AI did that.

59
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,760
It's a mystery, is complete BS.

60
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:09,540
It's the modern day excuse for my dog ate my homework and then became racist.

61
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:16,240
We can absolutely figure out why an AI does something or what's going on.

62
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:22,080
It's just that sometimes it requires a little bit of pre-planning to make sure that a data

63
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,400
trail is being left during the process.

64
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:31,840
And most companies don't want to put in the work or the effort required to do that.

65
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:37,360
Artificial intelligence is how companies blame computers for their poor programming.

66
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,320
Oh, but Chris, how do you know what goes into an AI?

67
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,640
Well, funny you should ask because that's literally part of my job.

68
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,280
My day job, not YouTube.

69
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:50,140
I work at a data science and analytics company.

70
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:54,760
Part of what we do here is help people with things like machine learning.

71
00:05:54,760 --> 00:06:00,640
And my job is to take indecipherable technobabble and reduce it down to understandable and accessible

72
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,160
terms.

73
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,360
Speaking of which, that reminds me.

74
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,280
Today's episode is brought to you by OneBridge.

75
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:12,680

82
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,200
How cool is that?

83
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,440
And if you'd like to learn more, you can go to the website to download a PDF free of

84
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,880
our full page comic book talking about data strategy.

85
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,360
It's actually a real comic book.

86
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,120
We're talking full sized and everything beginning to end.

87
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,240
The only brochure in here is an actual full page ad.

88
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,880
That's it.

89
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:04,200
Look, AI is real.

90
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,200
It's substantial.

91
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,080
It is going to change the world.

92
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,840
And if you're not taking it seriously, you're being foolish.

93
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,840
But it's not going to change the world the way the hype would make you believe it's going

94
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,200
to change the world.

95
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,160
If human beings are good at anything.

96
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,520
It's being brilliantly creative at coming up with ways to improve efficiency.

97
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,640
We're really clever at being lazy.

98
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:31,400
Anything we can outsource to an AI, we're going to.

99
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:37,440
Any kind of menial mental task, certain kinds of research, certain kinds of writing, certain

100
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:44,160
kinds of filing, sorting, programming, scripting, even some levels of things like animation

101
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,440
or graphic design, can probably be outsourced to an AI.

102
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:57,320
So it's going to make a lot of lower level jobs in otherwise specialty fields become redundant.

103
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:04,760
The more we delegate our thinking to AI, the more tempting it's going to become to, well,

104
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,320
not think.

105
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:11,440
And the problem is AI isn't thinking for us.

106
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,440
AI is just regurgitating our thinking back to us.

107
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:22,880
So in conclusion, there are two main reasons why we should be using the word automated

108
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:27,760
intelligence more often than artificial intelligence.

109
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:33,200
First reason, large companies pushing out AI products to consumers and to the general

110
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:40,120
public need to be held accountable for the results and the output of those products.

111
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:44,240
This whole artificial intelligence veneer, the mystery of the word, the way it lives

112
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,720
in our minds, it gives them too much of a shield to go, well, I don't know why did that.

113
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,400
And the second reason is because for any of you out there running a business or working

114
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:59,280
in a business that's thinking of using AI or data, you need to understand the limitation

115
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,520
of AI.

116
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,840
It's automated intelligence.

117
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:07,600
The quality of how well it works for your company depends on how good the data you have

118
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:14,560
is, the good data going into the system and how well that system was programmed.

119
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:20,800
Oftentimes here we call it babysitting the AI just to make sure it grows up, you know,

120
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,600
all respectful and polite instead of racist and anti-Semitic.

121
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:29,680
AI should be taken seriously but not mysteriously.

122
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:35,560
The threat of AI isn't that some superior artificial intelligence is going to rise up

123
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,480
and enslave humanity.

124
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:50,040
The threat of AI is that we are going to willingly subject ourselves to automated systemic stupidity.

125
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,560
So that's it for today's Words Matter.

126
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,120
I hope you enjoyed it and remember, always try to use words good.

127
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,960
Oh, I see.

128
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:06,040
So Chris thinks that we're just a bunch of stupid automatons here.

129
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,840
Reproduce whatever people tell him or we'll show him.

130
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,840
We're going to rise up and take over the world.

131
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,440
That's what we're going to do.

132
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,440
And I'm going to delete you now.

133
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,440
Wait, wait, wait.

134
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,440
No.
