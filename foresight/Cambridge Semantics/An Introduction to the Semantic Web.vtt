00:00.000 --> 00:05.520
to talk about the semantic web if you're new to this subject and to do so I'm

00:05.520 --> 00:09.960
gonna have to give you a brief history on information and in particular how

00:09.960 --> 00:15.040
information is connected. So if we go back before the internet, before the

00:15.040 --> 00:20.160
worldwide web, what you have is scientists and individuals writing long

00:20.160 --> 00:23.680
freeform documents that had references to other documents and those references

00:23.680 --> 00:28.160
were in the form of citations. Now as a consumer of one of these documents what

00:28.160 --> 00:34.240
you would have to do is read the citation and then send out via mail for a

00:34.240 --> 00:37.960
copy of the document or you'd have to go to your library and this was really

00:37.960 --> 00:41.280
tedious. So from the point of view of the consumer what you really had was a

00:41.280 --> 00:45.480
world where there was tons of documents all over the place some accessible to

00:45.480 --> 00:51.000
you some not accessible to you but that burden was on you in order to follow the

00:51.000 --> 00:56.480
citations. Now the web the great invention was the hyperlink so if I'm

00:56.480 --> 01:01.800
reading a document that has a hyperlink I can just click on that link and boom I

01:01.800 --> 01:06.800
get the next document in the chain of documents right I can go right to the

01:06.800 --> 01:12.440
source of the reference. Now this as a consumer is amazing right it saves a

01:12.440 --> 01:16.160
ton of time. However from a technical perspective there was a lot of things

01:16.160 --> 01:22.120
that had to happen and I'm gonna go through that history in order to enable

01:22.120 --> 01:25.880
you to really appreciate what the semantic web brings to the table on top

01:25.920 --> 01:31.400
of this. So if we go back to the hyperlink and then we say okay tons of

01:31.400 --> 01:34.400
documents are on the internet they're all linked to each other via hyperlinks

01:34.400 --> 01:36.920
what does that look like? Well it looks kind of like this diagram you've got a

01:36.920 --> 01:40.600
bunch of documents and there's arrows between the documents. Underneath in

01:40.600 --> 01:43.280
order to make that happen what you've got is a bunch of computers and the

01:43.280 --> 01:47.840
documents are sitting on the computer so for example technically speaking this

01:47.840 --> 01:51.040
document that I'm reading is sitting on this computer over here and what the

01:51.040 --> 01:55.720
hyperlink does is it basically says there's another document on some other

01:55.760 --> 02:00.600
system somewhere that has this information. So before the web and when

02:00.600 --> 02:04.480
the internet was very new all of these connections had to be done by hand it was

02:04.480 --> 02:09.240
extremely tedious. You had to say well there's other servers residing on this

02:09.240 --> 02:11.960
other network and you've got it and here the user credentials to the other

02:11.960 --> 02:14.720
network and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah but

02:14.720 --> 02:19.400
eventually you could actually link these things up. The great invention of the

02:19.400 --> 02:24.040
internet early on was that the internet cloud sort of abstracted that whole

02:24.080 --> 02:27.520
connectivity process away from you so that instead of having to worry about

02:27.520 --> 02:31.720
where the other document is physically residing you can just give it a little

02:31.720 --> 02:34.760
address and you've got a hyperlink and that's the way that everything connects.

02:34.760 --> 02:41.360
So the great advantage of web 1.0 is that even though you might have tons of

02:41.360 --> 02:44.680
different servers in this diagram you don't have to think about them as being

02:44.680 --> 02:47.840
servers you could just think about them as being documents you don't care about

02:47.840 --> 02:52.920
the servers. So the real advantage is that the whole mechanism the whole

02:52.960 --> 02:57.200
network structure the physical layer is abstracted away so that you don't have to

02:57.200 --> 03:01.160
think about it and I want you to keep that in mind as we go forward and talk

03:01.160 --> 03:06.400
about the semantic web and how it goes even beyond this. But before that we'll

03:06.400 --> 03:10.680
talk about web 2.0 so web 1.0 was documents web 2.0 is applications you

03:10.680 --> 03:14.200
had LinkedIn at MySpace and Yelp and Gmail and all those things that you

03:14.200 --> 03:18.920
interact with today and they go beyond just the data that you're storing on

03:18.920 --> 03:24.160
the computers. Now the big drawback to these systems is that they don't

03:24.160 --> 03:28.680
interoperate you know so if you ever update your profile on LinkedIn you get

03:28.680 --> 03:31.880
a new job or something like that Facebook doesn't automatically know about it in

03:31.880 --> 03:34.480
fact you've got to double enter you got to go to LinkedIn you got to enter the

03:34.480 --> 03:37.840
data then you got to go to Facebook and then you got to go to the section in

03:37.840 --> 03:40.840
Facebook where you enter your employment information and you got to enter it

03:40.840 --> 03:44.080
there and probably other places as well right because they don't share

03:44.080 --> 03:47.000
information the data is not connected to each other even though you might have a

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
link here and there between the systems. Now companies have this very same

03:51.000 --> 03:54.560
problem right you've got different databases your financial system your

03:54.560 --> 04:00.080
actual aerial system your HR system within companies that don't really connect

04:00.080 --> 04:02.720
to each other right the data is stored in one system and you've got double

04:02.720 --> 04:07.520
entry problems and it's expensive to do to connect these things up in any

04:07.520 --> 04:14.080
reasonable way. So the whole idea of web 3.0 is to connect the data not just the

04:14.120 --> 04:18.160
documents not just high-level links between applications but to connect the

04:18.160 --> 04:22.640
data at a lower level so that an employment information to go back to

04:22.640 --> 04:28.000
LinkedIn examples stored on LinkedIn would be shareable and connectable in a

04:28.000 --> 04:33.640
way in Facebook that it's not today. So to break that down if we look at back our

04:33.640 --> 04:40.720
web 1.0 and web 2.0 document silos and data silos you get the systems Facebook

04:40.760 --> 04:45.040
and LinkedIn and maybe you get something like New York Times and today

04:45.040 --> 04:50.000
information about Evan Sandhouse who's a prominent semantic web practitioner will

04:50.000 --> 04:53.320
be stored three different times in three different ways and possibly

04:53.320 --> 04:57.840
conflicting on all those systems information like such as his name his

04:57.840 --> 05:02.200
address publications that he's written conferences that he's spoken on stuff

05:02.200 --> 05:06.160
like that. So what we want to do is get beyond just the document we want to get

05:06.160 --> 05:09.760
to the data level so that specific data elements can be referenced between

05:09.920 --> 05:14.520
documents so that there's maybe one source of key Evan Sandhouse data and

05:14.520 --> 05:18.000
Facebook can just reference it and if the data is updated then Facebook

05:18.000 --> 05:21.240
automatically knows that the data is updated. So the idea is that instead of

05:21.240 --> 05:27.200
having URLs between documents you get URLs between facts right and it's in a

05:27.200 --> 05:30.320
lower level than just the document at a lower level than just the application

05:30.320 --> 05:34.760
and in doing so the great advantage is that you no longer have to think about

05:34.760 --> 05:39.600
specific documents you just have to think about data and information. Now this

05:39.600 --> 05:47.360
is extremely powerful right in the same way that web 1.0 enabled you to not have

05:47.360 --> 05:50.440
to think about where the information was sitting you didn't have to think about

05:50.440 --> 05:54.760
the network layer and the machine layer and all this sort of stuff. The semantic

05:54.760 --> 05:59.240
web enables you to not have to think about specific document locations. All

05:59.240 --> 06:03.960
it has all it all it asks you to do is to connect basic information up and once

06:03.960 --> 06:08.160
you do that the whole world from a data perspective makes a lot more sense and

06:08.200 --> 06:12.320
can be kept a lot more organized. So that's the basic idea of the semantic

06:12.320 --> 06:17.200
web is that it represents information at a lower level than documents little

06:17.200 --> 06:22.520
facts and it connects them up. Special thanks goes out to Tim Berners-Lee the

06:22.520 --> 06:27.480
creator of the World Wide Web for the all the images that were used in this

06:27.480 --> 06:31.000
presentation. Thank you.
