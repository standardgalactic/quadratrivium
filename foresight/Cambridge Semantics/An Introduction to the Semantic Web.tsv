0	5520	to talk about the semantic web if you're new to this subject and to do so I'm
5520	9960	gonna have to give you a brief history on information and in particular how
9960	15040	information is connected. So if we go back before the internet, before the
15040	20160	worldwide web, what you have is scientists and individuals writing long
20160	23680	freeform documents that had references to other documents and those references
23680	28160	were in the form of citations. Now as a consumer of one of these documents what
28160	34240	you would have to do is read the citation and then send out via mail for a
34240	37960	copy of the document or you'd have to go to your library and this was really
37960	41280	tedious. So from the point of view of the consumer what you really had was a
41280	45480	world where there was tons of documents all over the place some accessible to
45480	51000	you some not accessible to you but that burden was on you in order to follow the
51000	56480	citations. Now the web the great invention was the hyperlink so if I'm
56480	61800	reading a document that has a hyperlink I can just click on that link and boom I
61800	66800	get the next document in the chain of documents right I can go right to the
66800	72440	source of the reference. Now this as a consumer is amazing right it saves a
72440	76160	ton of time. However from a technical perspective there was a lot of things
76160	82120	that had to happen and I'm gonna go through that history in order to enable
82120	85880	you to really appreciate what the semantic web brings to the table on top
85920	91400	of this. So if we go back to the hyperlink and then we say okay tons of
91400	94400	documents are on the internet they're all linked to each other via hyperlinks
94400	96920	what does that look like? Well it looks kind of like this diagram you've got a
96920	100600	bunch of documents and there's arrows between the documents. Underneath in
100600	103280	order to make that happen what you've got is a bunch of computers and the
103280	107840	documents are sitting on the computer so for example technically speaking this
107840	111040	document that I'm reading is sitting on this computer over here and what the
111040	115720	hyperlink does is it basically says there's another document on some other
115760	120600	system somewhere that has this information. So before the web and when
120600	124480	the internet was very new all of these connections had to be done by hand it was
124480	129240	extremely tedious. You had to say well there's other servers residing on this
129240	131960	other network and you've got it and here the user credentials to the other
131960	134720	network and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah but
134720	139400	eventually you could actually link these things up. The great invention of the
139400	144040	internet early on was that the internet cloud sort of abstracted that whole
144080	147520	connectivity process away from you so that instead of having to worry about
147520	151720	where the other document is physically residing you can just give it a little
151720	154760	address and you've got a hyperlink and that's the way that everything connects.
154760	161360	So the great advantage of web 1.0 is that even though you might have tons of
161360	164680	different servers in this diagram you don't have to think about them as being
164680	167840	servers you could just think about them as being documents you don't care about
167840	172920	the servers. So the real advantage is that the whole mechanism the whole
172960	177200	network structure the physical layer is abstracted away so that you don't have to
177200	181160	think about it and I want you to keep that in mind as we go forward and talk
181160	186400	about the semantic web and how it goes even beyond this. But before that we'll
186400	190680	talk about web 2.0 so web 1.0 was documents web 2.0 is applications you
190680	194200	had LinkedIn at MySpace and Yelp and Gmail and all those things that you
194200	198920	interact with today and they go beyond just the data that you're storing on
198920	204160	the computers. Now the big drawback to these systems is that they don't
204160	208680	interoperate you know so if you ever update your profile on LinkedIn you get
208680	211880	a new job or something like that Facebook doesn't automatically know about it in
211880	214480	fact you've got to double enter you got to go to LinkedIn you got to enter the
214480	217840	data then you got to go to Facebook and then you got to go to the section in
217840	220840	Facebook where you enter your employment information and you got to enter it
220840	224080	there and probably other places as well right because they don't share
224080	227000	information the data is not connected to each other even though you might have a
227000	231000	link here and there between the systems. Now companies have this very same
231000	234560	problem right you've got different databases your financial system your
234560	240080	actual aerial system your HR system within companies that don't really connect
240080	242720	to each other right the data is stored in one system and you've got double
242720	247520	entry problems and it's expensive to do to connect these things up in any
247520	254080	reasonable way. So the whole idea of web 3.0 is to connect the data not just the
254120	258160	documents not just high-level links between applications but to connect the
258160	262640	data at a lower level so that an employment information to go back to
262640	268000	LinkedIn examples stored on LinkedIn would be shareable and connectable in a
268000	273640	way in Facebook that it's not today. So to break that down if we look at back our
273640	280720	web 1.0 and web 2.0 document silos and data silos you get the systems Facebook
280760	285040	and LinkedIn and maybe you get something like New York Times and today
285040	290000	information about Evan Sandhouse who's a prominent semantic web practitioner will
290000	293320	be stored three different times in three different ways and possibly
293320	297840	conflicting on all those systems information like such as his name his
297840	302200	address publications that he's written conferences that he's spoken on stuff
302200	306160	like that. So what we want to do is get beyond just the document we want to get
306160	309760	to the data level so that specific data elements can be referenced between
309920	314520	documents so that there's maybe one source of key Evan Sandhouse data and
314520	318000	Facebook can just reference it and if the data is updated then Facebook
318000	321240	automatically knows that the data is updated. So the idea is that instead of
321240	327200	having URLs between documents you get URLs between facts right and it's in a
327200	330320	lower level than just the document at a lower level than just the application
330320	334760	and in doing so the great advantage is that you no longer have to think about
334760	339600	specific documents you just have to think about data and information. Now this
339600	347360	is extremely powerful right in the same way that web 1.0 enabled you to not have
347360	350440	to think about where the information was sitting you didn't have to think about
350440	354760	the network layer and the machine layer and all this sort of stuff. The semantic
354760	359240	web enables you to not have to think about specific document locations. All
359240	363960	it has all it all it asks you to do is to connect basic information up and once
363960	368160	you do that the whole world from a data perspective makes a lot more sense and
368200	372320	can be kept a lot more organized. So that's the basic idea of the semantic
372320	377200	web is that it represents information at a lower level than documents little
377200	382520	facts and it connects them up. Special thanks goes out to Tim Berners-Lee the
382520	387480	creator of the World Wide Web for the all the images that were used in this
387480	391000	presentation. Thank you.
