1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
to talk about the semantic web if you're new to this subject and to do so I'm

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,960
gonna have to give you a brief history on information and in particular how

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:15,040
information is connected. So if we go back before the internet, before the

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,160
worldwide web, what you have is scientists and individuals writing long

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,680
freeform documents that had references to other documents and those references

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,160
were in the form of citations. Now as a consumer of one of these documents what

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,240
you would have to do is read the citation and then send out via mail for a

8
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,960
copy of the document or you'd have to go to your library and this was really

9
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,280
tedious. So from the point of view of the consumer what you really had was a

10
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,480
world where there was tons of documents all over the place some accessible to

11
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:51,000
you some not accessible to you but that burden was on you in order to follow the

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,480
citations. Now the web the great invention was the hyperlink so if I'm

13
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,800
reading a document that has a hyperlink I can just click on that link and boom I

14
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,800
get the next document in the chain of documents right I can go right to the

15
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:12,440
source of the reference. Now this as a consumer is amazing right it saves a

16
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:16,160
ton of time. However from a technical perspective there was a lot of things

17
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:22,120
that had to happen and I'm gonna go through that history in order to enable

18
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,880
you to really appreciate what the semantic web brings to the table on top

19
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,400
of this. So if we go back to the hyperlink and then we say okay tons of

20
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,400
documents are on the internet they're all linked to each other via hyperlinks

21
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,920
what does that look like? Well it looks kind of like this diagram you've got a

22
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,600
bunch of documents and there's arrows between the documents. Underneath in

23
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,280
order to make that happen what you've got is a bunch of computers and the

24
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,840
documents are sitting on the computer so for example technically speaking this

25
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,040
document that I'm reading is sitting on this computer over here and what the

26
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,720
hyperlink does is it basically says there's another document on some other

27
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:00,600
system somewhere that has this information. So before the web and when

28
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,480
the internet was very new all of these connections had to be done by hand it was

29
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:09,240
extremely tedious. You had to say well there's other servers residing on this

30
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,960
other network and you've got it and here the user credentials to the other

31
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,720
network and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah but

32
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,400
eventually you could actually link these things up. The great invention of the

33
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:24,040
internet early on was that the internet cloud sort of abstracted that whole

34
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,520
connectivity process away from you so that instead of having to worry about

35
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,720
where the other document is physically residing you can just give it a little

36
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,760
address and you've got a hyperlink and that's the way that everything connects.

37
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:41,360
So the great advantage of web 1.0 is that even though you might have tons of

38
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,680
different servers in this diagram you don't have to think about them as being

39
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,840
servers you could just think about them as being documents you don't care about

40
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,920
the servers. So the real advantage is that the whole mechanism the whole

41
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:57,200
network structure the physical layer is abstracted away so that you don't have to

42
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,160
think about it and I want you to keep that in mind as we go forward and talk

43
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:06,400
about the semantic web and how it goes even beyond this. But before that we'll

44
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,680
talk about web 2.0 so web 1.0 was documents web 2.0 is applications you

45
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,200
had LinkedIn at MySpace and Yelp and Gmail and all those things that you

46
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,920
interact with today and they go beyond just the data that you're storing on

47
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:24,160
the computers. Now the big drawback to these systems is that they don't

48
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:28,680
interoperate you know so if you ever update your profile on LinkedIn you get

49
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,880
a new job or something like that Facebook doesn't automatically know about it in

50
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,480
fact you've got to double enter you got to go to LinkedIn you got to enter the

51
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,840
data then you got to go to Facebook and then you got to go to the section in

52
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,840
Facebook where you enter your employment information and you got to enter it

53
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,080
there and probably other places as well right because they don't share

54
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,000
information the data is not connected to each other even though you might have a

55
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
link here and there between the systems. Now companies have this very same

56
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,560
problem right you've got different databases your financial system your

57
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,080
actual aerial system your HR system within companies that don't really connect

58
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,720
to each other right the data is stored in one system and you've got double

59
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,520
entry problems and it's expensive to do to connect these things up in any

60
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:14,080
reasonable way. So the whole idea of web 3.0 is to connect the data not just the

61
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:18,160
documents not just high-level links between applications but to connect the

62
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,640
data at a lower level so that an employment information to go back to

63
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:28,000
LinkedIn examples stored on LinkedIn would be shareable and connectable in a

64
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,640
way in Facebook that it's not today. So to break that down if we look at back our

65
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:40,720
web 1.0 and web 2.0 document silos and data silos you get the systems Facebook

66
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:45,040
and LinkedIn and maybe you get something like New York Times and today

67
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,000
information about Evan Sandhouse who's a prominent semantic web practitioner will

68
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,320
be stored three different times in three different ways and possibly

69
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,840
conflicting on all those systems information like such as his name his

70
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,200
address publications that he's written conferences that he's spoken on stuff

71
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,160
like that. So what we want to do is get beyond just the document we want to get

72
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,760
to the data level so that specific data elements can be referenced between

73
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:14,520
documents so that there's maybe one source of key Evan Sandhouse data and

74
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,000
Facebook can just reference it and if the data is updated then Facebook

75
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,240
automatically knows that the data is updated. So the idea is that instead of

76
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:27,200
having URLs between documents you get URLs between facts right and it's in a

77
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,320
lower level than just the document at a lower level than just the application

78
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,760
and in doing so the great advantage is that you no longer have to think about

79
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:39,600
specific documents you just have to think about data and information. Now this

80
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:47,360
is extremely powerful right in the same way that web 1.0 enabled you to not have

81
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,440
to think about where the information was sitting you didn't have to think about

82
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:54,760
the network layer and the machine layer and all this sort of stuff. The semantic

83
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:59,240
web enables you to not have to think about specific document locations. All

84
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,960
it has all it all it asks you to do is to connect basic information up and once

85
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,160
you do that the whole world from a data perspective makes a lot more sense and

86
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:12,320
can be kept a lot more organized. So that's the basic idea of the semantic

87
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:17,200
web is that it represents information at a lower level than documents little

88
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:22,520
facts and it connects them up. Special thanks goes out to Tim Berners-Lee the

89
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:27,480
creator of the World Wide Web for the all the images that were used in this

90
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:31,000
presentation. Thank you.
