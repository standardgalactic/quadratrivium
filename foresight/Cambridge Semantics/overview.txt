Checking Cambridge Semantics/An Introduction to the Semantic Web.txt
 The Semantic Web is an extension of the current web, which aims to enable machines to understand and respond to human data on the web with a level of intelligence equivalent to human understanding. Here's a summary of the history and evolution leading up to the concept of the Semantic Web:

1. **Before the Internet and World Wide Web**: Scientists and individuals used to write documents referencing other documents through citations, which required manual retrieval of the cited documents via mail or library visits.

2. **The Invention of the Hyperlink**: With the advent of the web, hyperlinks allowed users to navigate directly from one document to another, significantly improving the accessibility and usability of information.

3. **Web 1.0**: This era was characterized by static documents linked together. The technical complexities of connecting different systems were abstracted away, allowing users to focus on the content rather than the infrastructure.

4. **Web 2.0**: Introduced interactive and user-generated content through applications like LinkedIn, MySpace, Yelp, Gmail, etc. However, these systems were siloed, meaning that data wasn't easily shareable or interoperable across different platforms.

5. **Data Silos and the Need for Connectivity**: Companies and individuals often have to manage data redundancy because their different systems (financial, HR, etc.) don't natively connect with each other. This leads to inefficiencies and inconsistencies in data.

6. **Semantic Web**: The Semantic Web envisions a future where data is connected at the fact level rather than at the document or application level. It aims to enable interoperability between different systems, allowing data updates in one place to automatically reflect across all systems that use that data. This would mean that specific pieces of information (like Evan Sandhouse's employment details) would have a single source of truth, referenced and updated across various platforms without redundancy.

7. **The Advantage of the Semantic Web**: By connecting data at a fundamental level, the Semantic Web would eliminate the need for users to worry about which document contains specific information, as machines could intelligently manage and update this information across the web.

In essence, the Semantic Web is about creating a more intelligent, interconnected, and automated web ecosystem where data speaks for itself and is easily understood and utilized by both humans and machines. It's a vision that builds upon the original intent of the web as a means to share knowledge and make information universally accessible and useful.
