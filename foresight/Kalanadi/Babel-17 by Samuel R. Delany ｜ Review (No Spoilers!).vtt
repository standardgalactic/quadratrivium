Hello everybody! My name is Rachel and welcome to my channel Kalanadi. Today I am reviewing

00:05.120 --> 00:09.760
Battle 17 by Samuel R. Delaney. This is a classic science fiction novel originally published in

00:09.760 --> 00:15.200
1966 and it won the Nebula Award for that year, though actually it tied for the award but they

00:15.200 --> 00:21.520
both won. And bottom line, if you don't go any farther in this review, this is a classic sci-fi

00:21.520 --> 00:27.040
novel that I was really impressed by. The plot of this book is based on the Saper Warp Hypothesis

00:27.120 --> 00:34.320
an idea that the structure of a language can influence or even dictate the way that its

00:34.320 --> 00:39.920
speakers think or behave. I was surprised to discover that this particular theory was a lot

00:39.920 --> 00:44.960
older than I thought it was. I first heard about it in a linguistics course almost 10 years ago

00:44.960 --> 00:49.120
and for some reason I thought that it had been disproven. That does not appear to be the case.

00:50.400 --> 00:56.480
People don't think that it so drastically affects the way that people think but it hasn't been

00:56.480 --> 01:03.440
disproven either. It's had its heyday but it's not been abandoned. And this book written in the 1960s

01:03.440 --> 01:10.480
when the hypothesis was kind of I think on its way out really explores the extreme possibilities

01:10.480 --> 01:16.080
of that linguistic idea of language kind of controlling people. In this future humanity

01:16.080 --> 01:20.720
has spread throughout the galaxy and they are currently engaged in a war with the invaders.

01:20.720 --> 01:25.600
There have been a series of attacks and infiltrations on the good guys outposts

01:25.600 --> 01:31.120
and during these they intercept radio chatter which is in a code that they can't break. They

01:31.120 --> 01:37.360
turn to a woman named Raidra Wong. She is a poet with a background in cryptography and amazing

01:37.360 --> 01:42.480
linguistic skills and they ask her to break this code for them. They call it Babel 17.

01:43.040 --> 01:47.680
Raidra discovers that this isn't actually a code. It's a full-blown language making it

01:47.680 --> 01:52.720
much more complex and she also discovers that it seems to have a interesting effect

01:53.520 --> 01:58.160
on people's behavior or the way that they think when they learn how to speak it.

01:58.160 --> 02:05.200
And she goes off on a quest to discover where the language came from, what it can do, and ultimately

02:05.200 --> 02:12.480
try to stop the war and the attacks. I'll be honest I set my expectations really low for this book

02:13.200 --> 02:17.600
not because I thought it was going to be bad but because I've heard various things about

02:17.600 --> 02:23.200
Delaney's writing style, some of the weirder concepts he puts into books, and I just wasn't

02:23.200 --> 02:27.680
sure that it was going to be my kind of thing. I was expecting it to be like a super psychedelic

02:27.680 --> 02:37.280
weird 60s trip and it wasn't. It has a 60s vibe but it's not as far out as I expected it to be.

02:37.280 --> 02:43.600
And I think that a lot of my enjoyment of this book comes from the fact that it avoids some of

02:43.600 --> 02:50.400
the cliches of 60s and 70s classic sci-fi that are really beginning to annoy me these days.

02:50.400 --> 02:56.800
This is a book written in the 1960s by a gay african-american man which explores

02:56.800 --> 03:04.080
non-straight sexuality and has a female asian protagonist.

03:04.080 --> 03:10.560
Redra is described as being very beautiful but she's also talented and intelligent.

03:10.560 --> 03:17.360
She has mental and physical strengths. She is not a cardboard cut out of a female character

03:17.360 --> 03:24.000
shoved into scenes to be pretty and to have sex with the male characters. She is a person.

03:24.000 --> 03:29.760
As a character she stands on her own and she is more highly valued by the other characters in this

03:29.760 --> 03:36.720
book for what's inside of her head rather than what's on her face. This is very refreshing.

03:36.720 --> 03:43.120
Thank you Delaney for proving that someone could do this back in the 60s. I'm gonna have a really

03:43.120 --> 03:51.680
hard time giving any other classic sff books a pass for lack of diversity when obviously Delaney

03:51.680 --> 03:57.440
has proved that it could have been done back then. He did it! Why didn't anybody else do it too?

03:57.440 --> 04:01.600
The other thing that I really enjoyed about this book is that it's based on a linguistic

04:01.600 --> 04:08.640
theory whereas a lot of the sf that I read from this time period and modern is often really based

04:08.640 --> 04:16.000
around a hard scientific concept often to the detriment of character development but this

04:16.000 --> 04:24.320
is a book about language and about how language affects people and you really can't have a linguistic

04:24.320 --> 04:30.720
theory or a language without the people that speak it. Now there are some jarring elements of this

04:30.720 --> 04:37.680
book mainly because it is old and it is one of Delaney's earlier novels. As far as the science goes

04:37.680 --> 04:43.280
I think that Babel 17 is quite typical of a lot of books written before we went digital. A lot of

04:43.280 --> 04:50.720
the terminology and the technology is out of date. We've conquered the galaxy but we're still using

04:50.720 --> 04:56.720
punch card machines to run our computers and tape recorders. I didn't find it that bad though.

04:56.720 --> 05:01.520
Sometimes I can be really pulled out of a science fiction book when it becomes obvious to me that

05:01.520 --> 05:06.880
these science is flawed or incredibly wrong but I didn't get that sense during this book. It just

05:06.880 --> 05:13.040
it feels a bit old. The other thing is the writing style. The introduction to my sf masterworks

05:13.040 --> 05:21.360
edition does discuss the exuberant language. This book has the feel of a young writer discovering

05:21.360 --> 05:27.680
the treasure trove that is the English language and just spewing vibrant words and experimental

05:27.680 --> 05:33.200
language across the page. But once again it wasn't too much for me. It certainly felt like the work

05:33.200 --> 05:40.320
of a young writer but even though I have a low tolerance for experimental language and poetry

05:40.320 --> 05:46.400
and so on it still worked for me and I actually found that it contributed to a certain atmosphere

05:46.400 --> 05:52.560
in this book. The upshot of my review is that I really enjoyed babble 17 despite my very low

05:52.560 --> 05:58.160
expectations. I really enjoyed reading this book and if you are interested in reading classic

05:58.160 --> 06:03.760
science fiction you could do a lot worse than to pick up this book. I definitely think it is one of

06:03.760 --> 06:09.600
the best classic sci-fi novels I have read so far. I haven't read that many let's be honest here but

06:10.240 --> 06:18.720
I have been underwhelmed by quite a few and this and rendezvous with Rama by Arthur C Clark are

06:19.280 --> 06:23.840
really the only two classic sci-fi novels that I think I would reread at some point.

06:23.840 --> 06:27.600
And that's it for my review. I hope you found this helpful. If you're interested in reading

06:27.600 --> 06:33.280
babble 17 or another book by Samuel R. Delaney I definitely am going to be picking up Dolgren

06:33.280 --> 06:40.400
or Nova by him pretty soon. Thank you for watching and until my next video, bye!
