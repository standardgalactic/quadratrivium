0	5120	Hello everybody! My name is Rachel and welcome to my channel Kalanadi. Today I am reviewing
5120	9760	Battle 17 by Samuel R. Delaney. This is a classic science fiction novel originally published in
9760	15200	1966 and it won the Nebula Award for that year, though actually it tied for the award but they
15200	21520	both won. And bottom line, if you don't go any farther in this review, this is a classic sci-fi
21520	27040	novel that I was really impressed by. The plot of this book is based on the Saper Warp Hypothesis
27120	34320	an idea that the structure of a language can influence or even dictate the way that its
34320	39920	speakers think or behave. I was surprised to discover that this particular theory was a lot
39920	44960	older than I thought it was. I first heard about it in a linguistics course almost 10 years ago
44960	49120	and for some reason I thought that it had been disproven. That does not appear to be the case.
50400	56480	People don't think that it so drastically affects the way that people think but it hasn't been
56480	63440	disproven either. It's had its heyday but it's not been abandoned. And this book written in the 1960s
63440	70480	when the hypothesis was kind of I think on its way out really explores the extreme possibilities
70480	76080	of that linguistic idea of language kind of controlling people. In this future humanity
76080	80720	has spread throughout the galaxy and they are currently engaged in a war with the invaders.
80720	85600	There have been a series of attacks and infiltrations on the good guys outposts
85600	91120	and during these they intercept radio chatter which is in a code that they can't break. They
91120	97360	turn to a woman named Raidra Wong. She is a poet with a background in cryptography and amazing
97360	102480	linguistic skills and they ask her to break this code for them. They call it Babel 17.
103040	107680	Raidra discovers that this isn't actually a code. It's a full-blown language making it
107680	112720	much more complex and she also discovers that it seems to have a interesting effect
113520	118160	on people's behavior or the way that they think when they learn how to speak it.
118160	125200	And she goes off on a quest to discover where the language came from, what it can do, and ultimately
125200	132480	try to stop the war and the attacks. I'll be honest I set my expectations really low for this book
133200	137600	not because I thought it was going to be bad but because I've heard various things about
137600	143200	Delaney's writing style, some of the weirder concepts he puts into books, and I just wasn't
143200	147680	sure that it was going to be my kind of thing. I was expecting it to be like a super psychedelic
147680	157280	weird 60s trip and it wasn't. It has a 60s vibe but it's not as far out as I expected it to be.
157280	163600	And I think that a lot of my enjoyment of this book comes from the fact that it avoids some of
163600	170400	the cliches of 60s and 70s classic sci-fi that are really beginning to annoy me these days.
170400	176800	This is a book written in the 1960s by a gay african-american man which explores
176800	184080	non-straight sexuality and has a female asian protagonist.
184080	190560	Redra is described as being very beautiful but she's also talented and intelligent.
190560	197360	She has mental and physical strengths. She is not a cardboard cut out of a female character
197360	204000	shoved into scenes to be pretty and to have sex with the male characters. She is a person.
204000	209760	As a character she stands on her own and she is more highly valued by the other characters in this
209760	216720	book for what's inside of her head rather than what's on her face. This is very refreshing.
216720	223120	Thank you Delaney for proving that someone could do this back in the 60s. I'm gonna have a really
223120	231680	hard time giving any other classic sff books a pass for lack of diversity when obviously Delaney
231680	237440	has proved that it could have been done back then. He did it! Why didn't anybody else do it too?
237440	241600	The other thing that I really enjoyed about this book is that it's based on a linguistic
241600	248640	theory whereas a lot of the sf that I read from this time period and modern is often really based
248640	256000	around a hard scientific concept often to the detriment of character development but this
256000	264320	is a book about language and about how language affects people and you really can't have a linguistic
264320	270720	theory or a language without the people that speak it. Now there are some jarring elements of this
270720	277680	book mainly because it is old and it is one of Delaney's earlier novels. As far as the science goes
277680	283280	I think that Babel 17 is quite typical of a lot of books written before we went digital. A lot of
283280	290720	the terminology and the technology is out of date. We've conquered the galaxy but we're still using
290720	296720	punch card machines to run our computers and tape recorders. I didn't find it that bad though.
296720	301520	Sometimes I can be really pulled out of a science fiction book when it becomes obvious to me that
301520	306880	these science is flawed or incredibly wrong but I didn't get that sense during this book. It just
306880	313040	it feels a bit old. The other thing is the writing style. The introduction to my sf masterworks
313040	321360	edition does discuss the exuberant language. This book has the feel of a young writer discovering
321360	327680	the treasure trove that is the English language and just spewing vibrant words and experimental
327680	333200	language across the page. But once again it wasn't too much for me. It certainly felt like the work
333200	340320	of a young writer but even though I have a low tolerance for experimental language and poetry
340320	346400	and so on it still worked for me and I actually found that it contributed to a certain atmosphere
346400	352560	in this book. The upshot of my review is that I really enjoyed babble 17 despite my very low
352560	358160	expectations. I really enjoyed reading this book and if you are interested in reading classic
358160	363760	science fiction you could do a lot worse than to pick up this book. I definitely think it is one of
363760	369600	the best classic sci-fi novels I have read so far. I haven't read that many let's be honest here but
370240	378720	I have been underwhelmed by quite a few and this and rendezvous with Rama by Arthur C Clark are
379280	383840	really the only two classic sci-fi novels that I think I would reread at some point.
383840	387600	And that's it for my review. I hope you found this helpful. If you're interested in reading
387600	393280	babble 17 or another book by Samuel R. Delaney I definitely am going to be picking up Dolgren
393280	400400	or Nova by him pretty soon. Thank you for watching and until my next video, bye!
