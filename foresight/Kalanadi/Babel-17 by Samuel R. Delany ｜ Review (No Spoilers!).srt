00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
Hello everybody! My name is Rachel and welcome to my channel Kalanadi. Today I am reviewing

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,760
Battle 17 by Samuel R. Delaney. This is a classic science fiction novel originally published in

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:15,200
1966 and it won the Nebula Award for that year, though actually it tied for the award but they

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:21,520
both won. And bottom line, if you don't go any farther in this review, this is a classic sci-fi

5
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:27,040
novel that I was really impressed by. The plot of this book is based on the Saper Warp Hypothesis

6
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:34,320
an idea that the structure of a language can influence or even dictate the way that its

7
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,920
speakers think or behave. I was surprised to discover that this particular theory was a lot

8
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,960
older than I thought it was. I first heard about it in a linguistics course almost 10 years ago

9
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,120
and for some reason I thought that it had been disproven. That does not appear to be the case.

10
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:56,480
People don't think that it so drastically affects the way that people think but it hasn't been

11
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:03,440
disproven either. It's had its heyday but it's not been abandoned. And this book written in the 1960s

12
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:10,480
when the hypothesis was kind of I think on its way out really explores the extreme possibilities

13
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:16,080
of that linguistic idea of language kind of controlling people. In this future humanity

14
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,720
has spread throughout the galaxy and they are currently engaged in a war with the invaders.

15
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,600
There have been a series of attacks and infiltrations on the good guys outposts

16
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:31,120
and during these they intercept radio chatter which is in a code that they can't break. They

17
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:37,360
turn to a woman named Raidra Wong. She is a poet with a background in cryptography and amazing

18
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,480
linguistic skills and they ask her to break this code for them. They call it Babel 17.

19
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,680
Raidra discovers that this isn't actually a code. It's a full-blown language making it

20
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,720
much more complex and she also discovers that it seems to have a interesting effect

21
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,160
on people's behavior or the way that they think when they learn how to speak it.

22
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:05,200
And she goes off on a quest to discover where the language came from, what it can do, and ultimately

23
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:12,480
try to stop the war and the attacks. I'll be honest I set my expectations really low for this book

24
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,600
not because I thought it was going to be bad but because I've heard various things about

25
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:23,200
Delaney's writing style, some of the weirder concepts he puts into books, and I just wasn't

26
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,680
sure that it was going to be my kind of thing. I was expecting it to be like a super psychedelic

27
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:37,280
weird 60s trip and it wasn't. It has a 60s vibe but it's not as far out as I expected it to be.

28
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:43,600
And I think that a lot of my enjoyment of this book comes from the fact that it avoids some of

29
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:50,400
the cliches of 60s and 70s classic sci-fi that are really beginning to annoy me these days.

30
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:56,800
This is a book written in the 1960s by a gay african-american man which explores

31
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:04,080
non-straight sexuality and has a female asian protagonist.

32
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,560
Redra is described as being very beautiful but she's also talented and intelligent.

33
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:17,360
She has mental and physical strengths. She is not a cardboard cut out of a female character

34
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:24,000
shoved into scenes to be pretty and to have sex with the male characters. She is a person.

35
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,760
As a character she stands on her own and she is more highly valued by the other characters in this

36
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:36,720
book for what's inside of her head rather than what's on her face. This is very refreshing.

37
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:43,120
Thank you Delaney for proving that someone could do this back in the 60s. I'm gonna have a really

38
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:51,680
hard time giving any other classic sff books a pass for lack of diversity when obviously Delaney

39
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,440
has proved that it could have been done back then. He did it! Why didn't anybody else do it too?

40
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,600
The other thing that I really enjoyed about this book is that it's based on a linguistic

41
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:08,640
theory whereas a lot of the sf that I read from this time period and modern is often really based

42
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:16,000
around a hard scientific concept often to the detriment of character development but this

43
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:24,320
is a book about language and about how language affects people and you really can't have a linguistic

44
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:30,720
theory or a language without the people that speak it. Now there are some jarring elements of this

45
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:37,680
book mainly because it is old and it is one of Delaney's earlier novels. As far as the science goes

46
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,280
I think that Babel 17 is quite typical of a lot of books written before we went digital. A lot of

47
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:50,720
the terminology and the technology is out of date. We've conquered the galaxy but we're still using

48
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:56,720
punch card machines to run our computers and tape recorders. I didn't find it that bad though.

49
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,520
Sometimes I can be really pulled out of a science fiction book when it becomes obvious to me that

50
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,880
these science is flawed or incredibly wrong but I didn't get that sense during this book. It just

51
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:13,040
it feels a bit old. The other thing is the writing style. The introduction to my sf masterworks

52
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:21,360
edition does discuss the exuberant language. This book has the feel of a young writer discovering

53
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:27,680
the treasure trove that is the English language and just spewing vibrant words and experimental

54
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:33,200
language across the page. But once again it wasn't too much for me. It certainly felt like the work

55
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:40,320
of a young writer but even though I have a low tolerance for experimental language and poetry

56
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:46,400
and so on it still worked for me and I actually found that it contributed to a certain atmosphere

57
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:52,560
in this book. The upshot of my review is that I really enjoyed babble 17 despite my very low

58
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,160
expectations. I really enjoyed reading this book and if you are interested in reading classic

59
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,760
science fiction you could do a lot worse than to pick up this book. I definitely think it is one of

60
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:09,600
the best classic sci-fi novels I have read so far. I haven't read that many let's be honest here but

61
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:18,720
I have been underwhelmed by quite a few and this and rendezvous with Rama by Arthur C Clark are

62
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,840
really the only two classic sci-fi novels that I think I would reread at some point.

63
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,600
And that's it for my review. I hope you found this helpful. If you're interested in reading

64
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:33,280
babble 17 or another book by Samuel R. Delaney I definitely am going to be picking up Dolgren

65
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:40,400
or Nova by him pretty soon. Thank you for watching and until my next video, bye!
