0	5040	Welcome to the stage, Optimist, Author, and Founder of the Curve, Simon Sinek.
7520	16640	Yes. Thank you. Thank you very much. So obviously you're all here for Scott Galloway.
20560	26320	Scott is one of those people who pushes you to see the world differently. It's one of the reasons
26320	32400	I love him and love his work. He also puts himself out there in a way that I think very,
32400	40240	very few others can or want to. He's so vulnerable and shares with us the struggles that he's going
40240	46880	through that we can relate to. But more important, his views on the world, his perspective on how it
46880	51200	works are different than everybody else, which is why we have to listen to Scott. He doesn't always get
51200	57600	his predictions right, but we have to listen. Ladies and gentlemen, Scott Galloway.
60880	68160	Thanks. Thank you. My name is Scott Galloway. I teach at NYU. I have 147 slides and
70800	74560	2400 seconds, so let's light this candle. So in the spirit of transparency,
75680	80160	I don't know Simon how well I don't like him very much, but it's a power move to have him introduce
80160	90240	me. Okay, so I got home pretty late last night and decided to reorient the slides. I fiddled with
90240	94560	the slides up until the time I present them, and I thought given that we're on a cruise ship,
95200	98880	and I met a lot of people last night who are in the business of travel that we would try and talk
98880	103600	about. Travel, I'll make some predictions around tech. It's kind of around the world
103600	108240	towards basically whatever I just wanted to talk about tonight. And then hopefully we'll leave
108240	111760	some time for my favorite part, Q&A. We have a pretty intimate crowd here tonight,
111760	116560	so I'm going to try and leave some time for Q&A. Okay, we're going to talk about the economy,
117600	121760	travel, transportation, what else, because we didn't get enough of that today,
123200	129280	income inequality. I'm worried about the shit I've created after I've made tens of millions of dollars,
130400	136880	but I'm Dr. Frankenstein, and I think Frank might have some violent tendencies. I'm concerned.
136880	141680	Yeah, fuck you, figure out what we do. I'm going to talk about loneliness,
143280	146000	and then I'm going to try and wrap up with, quote unquote, some perspective.
147520	151120	So if you weren't reading every day that we were about to have a recession,
151120	157200	where would the evidence of any recession be? I think that inflation is going to come down
157200	163760	as quickly as it went up. AI, the rider's strike, which will end in tears for the riders.
164720	169600	For the first time, people are not as confident negotiating pet bereavement leave and the growth
169600	175200	economy. I think you're about to see wage pressure come way down, and you're about to see inflation
176160	184160	come way down, back to historic or more normal levels. And I'm not sure. I studied economics,
184160	191440	but I don't consider myself an economist, but I don't see any signs of a recession. As I said,
191520	198800	inflation is coming way down. Unemployment is at historic lows. Now, some people would argue,
198800	204160	well, there's discouraged workers, you have the wrong denominator here, but we essentially have
204800	210000	historically low unemployment, retail sales are strong. We've ripped through about four to five
210000	213920	trillion dollars we handed out during the pandemic, and we're ripping through another
213920	218400	hundred billion a month. So there is some credence to the argument. I'm trying to stand over here,
218480	222800	that in about 10 months, people are going to run out of money. But right now, it doesn't appear
223360	228400	unless you were looking at the media that you'd see any real signals that were going into a
228400	233680	recession. All of a sudden, we're starting to see people talk about earnings calls or in earnings
233680	238800	calls use the term soft landing as opposed to recession. They're even starting to soften their
238800	245280	tone. There's an effect that when you worry about something or the moment you really begin to start
245280	249840	worrying about something, the odds of it happening go way down, right? It's the shit you don't see
249840	254880	coming that gets you. None of us really saw the pandemic coming. Remember Greek sovereign debt
254880	258480	that was supposedly going to collapse and take down all of Europe or that all elevators were
258480	265280	going to start stop working New Year's 2000. It's a general survival instinct that if you worry about
265280	271040	something long enough, you unconsciously prepare for it and you avoid it. So we have been talking
271040	275120	so much about the recession that I wonder if we're probably not going to, it's not going to
275120	280560	register. Where we are seeing a recession is what I call the Patagonia vest recession.
284800	290480	I have two entries. I'm credited with two entries in the urban dictionary. The first is yoga babble,
290480	297040	which is how I describe the we work prospectus. And then I just got my second one and that is the
297040	304160	Patagonia vest recession. And that is the growth economy has had so many calories stuffed down.
304240	309840	It's esophagus that it's built up fatty deposits everywhere. And if you understand
309840	314880	balance sheet economics, essentially, if you have gross margins of 20%, which is great gross
314880	321120	margins or operating margins, excuse me, of 20%, you can either add $5 a new income of new revenue
321120	326000	to your company, or you can cut a dollar of expenses. And you have the same net effect on
326000	332160	shareholder value. So the most actionable or significant on the ground impact or strategy
332160	339040	of 2023 isn't AI, it isn't supply chain. It's everybody in every boardroom has seen what Elon
339040	345040	Musk has done. Specifically, he's fired 80% of his staff. He's taken the step down from 7500
345040	350640	people to 1800, he's going to 1000. And there really isn't from the consumer in any discernible
350640	356880	impact on the product. Now, he's lost about 80% of us or 60 to 80% of his advertising revenue,
356880	361520	but people would argue that's a self inflicted wound. So in every board, people are asking
361520	368080	themselves how do we have the great taste of reduced costs without the calories of losing
368080	373440	revenue. So the business strategy circulating the majority of the growth economy is could we
373440	379600	lay out 10, 20, 30% of our employees, but manage to hold on to the majority of our revenues. That
379600	384480	is the easiest way to add shareholder value and the markets like it every time a company announces
384480	390000	layoffs, the stock goes up. The majority of people in this room have never really seen that type of
390000	395040	economy before. When I graduated from business school, 40% of my class had a job. So in other
395040	399920	words, 60%, two thirds of the class did not have a single job. My kids now when I say kids,
399920	404880	I mean my students on average have between three and five job offers out of NYU Stern,
404880	410560	average salary $212,000. Meaning if someone goes to work for a nonprofit for 100th grand,
410560	418720	there's somebody who's accepted a job at 330 or $350,000. That is much different. That is no one
418720	423360	ever feels overpaid. The majority of us in this room right now are overpaid.
426240	431600	Oh, I do have sound. If in the back, if you can hear this video, this video does have sound.
431600	435760	This is one of my favorite videos to kind of summarize the growth economy.
448720	470480	Can you imagine the fight over who would get to fire this person?
478960	488320	I have 300 kids in my class, about 30 or 40 of them go to work for Amazon, about 20 Google.
488320	493840	Literally big tech was coming in every year and hoovering up all human capital. It was a fight.
493840	497840	Like every manager's job usually at the end of the year, and I run growth companies,
497840	504720	is how do we keep the young people happy, right? It was just a constant question. How do we keep
504720	512320	people with us? How do we attract new people? That has flipped. I love these TikToks now of
512320	518320	people getting fired that day. My first piece of advice, because I don't think many of you have
518320	525280	been fired before. I've been fired from every job I've ever had. It's not about you. It's not a
526720	531200	statement on your character. It's not about the condition of your soul. It's usually about things
531200	536000	outside of your control. I think the tech community and the labor force was lying to you when they
536000	540320	said, bring your full self to work. Don't bring your politics to work. No one gives a shit about
540320	546000	your politics. Corporations are a platform to build economic security for you and your family,
546000	551040	and they might have pretended that they cared, but they don't. Don't think that when you get
551040	555840	fired or laid off, it's an assessment on you. No, it's not. It's about what's happening at the
555840	562000	time in the economy, almost always. You've got to put these layoffs in context, though. They make
562000	569680	for great headlines. Huge headlines. Amazon, Meta lays off 8,000 people from page. But this is how
569680	574720	many people they've hired since the beginning of the pandemic. So all these, quote, unquote,
574720	579520	mass firings are just taking them back to employment levels of 12 or 18 months ago.
580160	584880	This is still just a fraction of the people that human capital that they have brought into their
584880	592320	organizations in the last 36 months. The layoffs here, despite all the headlines, represent about
592320	598720	1% of non-farm payroll employment. We're obsessed with big tech, but it relates to the economy in
598720	602800	terms of market capitalization. It's big, but it's employment. It actually doesn't employ that many
602800	611520	people. 2023, the year of experiences. So if you looked at most things, most structural trends,
611520	616480	whether it's e-commerce, even teen depression. And you didn't know the pandemic had happened,
616480	620880	and it just maintained its current slope. Teen depression has been going up steadily since the
620880	625840	introduction of social on mobile. E-commerce has been growing high, single, low, double digits per
625840	630880	year. They've all kind of returned to where they would have been around the pandemic. The only thing
630880	636720	that appears to be the enduring change is work from home. That appears to be very, very sticky.
636720	640560	That's kind of the enduring change coming out of COVID, where if someone showed up and said,
640560	645280	how is the world different? How do we know something happened here? It would be remote work.
645280	650960	And the really disappointing work, or the Gene Twanging and Jonathan High just came out with,
650960	656320	is that we've been blaming depression of kids on COVID. And the reality is, if you look at the
656320	663040	trends of teen depression, what they found is, it wasn't COVID. It was social media that was doing
663040	668720	it. And some social distancing didn't create depression among teens. Social media did.
671120	675360	Ton of revenge travel, right? One of the wonderful things about coming out of COVID is people seem
675360	681360	to have a renewed sense of what's important, the finite nature of life, and people are going big
681360	687520	in terms of travel. Travel sites traffic up dramatically. New record for passports that
687520	693120	have been issued in the United States. China's returning to the tourism market. So that's new
693120	698640	wind in the sails. And people are spending a greater proportion of their disposable income
699440	707520	on travel. And then we're seeing huge demand returning. For the most part, the travel industry
707520	713120	is taking advantage of this. And using COVID as an excuse not to restore previous service levels,
713120	717040	I get to stay in very nice places, mostly because someone else is paying. And the way I would describe
717040	723280	luxury travel right now is six star prices with four star service. And as a result, their margins
723280	727840	have never been bigger. They're making up for the revenues that they were, that they lost through
727840	730400	COVID. It's a great time to be in the travel business.
733360	737680	Live entertainment is surging. People want to be around each other, which is a wonderful thing.
738640	743440	And also people have a renewed sense of the value of time versus money.
745600	750720	Okay, so everything in its own way is retail. And I would argue that the worst retail experiences
750720	756480	are grocery stores, airports and gas stations. Tesla didn't disrupt the auto industry, it disrupted
756480	763120	the gas station. If you spent 15 minutes a week in a gas station, that's 12 and a half hours a year
763120	768480	pulling in, smelling those carcinogens, worrying about getting shot. That is literally the worst
768480	775680	retail experience in America. How much would someone have to pay you to get up at six, get to the
775680	781360	gas station at seven in the morning, fill up, drive around the block and do that until seven
781360	788000	30 at night? You would probably pay a lot of money to avoid that. In addition, this industry
788000	793040	was so disruptible, mostly because of charging stations or mostly because of the gas stations.
793040	796720	I think disruption is more a function of how ripe an industry is to be disrupted
796720	800640	as opposed to the disrupting technology. It wasn't immediately obvious that Google was
800640	805360	going to disrupt the advertising industry, but the advertising industry had basically said,
805360	810640	we're going to triple our costs every 10 years, even despite the fact that our audiences are
810640	816400	shrinking, more expensive for less reach. It stuck out its chin. Grocery stores and department
816400	822240	stores really hadn't changed in about 30 or 40 years in the fists of stone of Amazon came for it.
822240	829120	Ad-supported cable television got worse and worse, but more and more expensive. Netflix came in at
829120	835360	12 bucks a month and disrupted that industry. The question then becomes, what industry is most
835360	841760	ripe for disruption? AI is clearly the technology, but more important than the technology is what
841760	847040	industry has an enormous chin sticking out right now. I'll come back and try and answer that.
849120	853600	Lines, we spent a lot of time in lines. I think that essentially, if you want to build a company
853600	858720	that's worth over $100 billion, you've got to build a time machine. If you just let your kids
858720	863760	watch Netflix and not broadcast television, that kid says it's 12 days a year in commercials.
864560	870640	Amazon has given you six days back at a spending time in department stores and grocery stores.
870640	875600	The majority of companies that get past $100 billion have effectively built time machines.
877600	883120	I love the company clear. I'm obsessed with trying to expedite everything. In terms of time,
883120	888240	you get that way as you get older. Most of these high-end luxury items are pretty much focused on
888240	896960	saving time. Peter Drucker, who is sort of my role model, an economist in the 60s, basically
896960	901440	said that every major business trend can be predicted by demographics. If you were to try
901440	905280	and find a demographic trend that's going to wag the tail, that it's a good thing to get behind,
905280	910560	and I did get behind this in 2010, I started a company doing business intelligence and analytics
910560	914960	for luxury brands because what I saw was that income inequality was about to become income
914960	920400	insanity. History repeats itself. Essentially, you have an economy that starts off as a collective.
920400	925360	Everybody wants to help each other. Wealthy people weaponize government, become more productive,
925360	930560	leverage technology, and slowly but surely figure out a way to lower their taxes and figure out a
930560	935280	way to engage in massive tax avoidance, to create more and more power, and will wring their hands
935280	939600	and be very concerned about what's going on. In the next year, the tax rate goes down.
940480	944560	Eventually, there's a revolution, and it starts all over again. We're at a point
944560	949200	right now where it's literally gone parabolic, and you've seen all this data about the 0.1%.
950320	953760	But if I were to say to people constantly coming to me and say, what industry would you be in,
953760	960400	I'm like, if I were just going to any industry serving the 0.1%, because the amount of disposable
960400	965680	income there, it's like that very basic adage that people used to tell young professionals,
965680	970080	get as close to the biggest pile of money, stand as close as you can to the biggest pile of money,
970080	974880	and everything will work out. And that pile of money is increasingly accreting to fewer and fewer
975520	983040	people. So social clubs, the 1% is now sequestering from everybody else, right? We allow visitors in
983040	987280	based on being super interesting or super hot as tourists. We give them a day pass,
987280	992480	but mostly we've decided we no longer want to hang out with the other 99%, even when we're socializing.
995200	998240	Anyone done one of these private tours at Disney? Disney just announced
999200	1006240	pretty terrible earnings, but they were saved by one thing, the parks. What they didn't publish
1006240	1011440	was the thing driving a ton of incremental spend there is these private VIP tours,
1012240	1016240	where you pay somewhere between, I think, seven and 900 bucks an hour, a minimum of five hours.
1016240	1021920	So for about five to seven grand, you and five friends get to cut the line. I did this for the
1021920	1027040	first time last year. And it's physically uncomfortable when you get to the Avatar ride,
1027040	1033760	and they could hand out an iPad when you get in the line. And you could watch Avatar before
1033760	1039440	you actually get on the ride. The wait time is three hours if you only paid 160 bucks.
1040160	1046320	But if you paid 7,000, you and your kids get to cut the line, it's about three minutes,
1046320	1050400	and they give you a hand signal in case you want to go on it a second or a third time.
1051280	1056480	And this is the fastest growing part of the park's business. Think about the profits there,
1056480	1064800	a very high EQ, really nice young man from Kansas shows you around, takes you to a golf cart
1064800	1070080	behind the bowels of the three parks, so you can go on the two or three best rides at each of the
1070080	1080800	three parks. It's getting worse. And most of you have probably seen this on TikTok,
1080880	1086800	but this is where this is socialism, right? You start off thinking everyone should be equal.
1086800	1092320	It doesn't work, right? People engage in their own self-interest. That's what capitalism is,
1092320	1096160	taps into one of the most powerful motivators, and that is our own self-interest.
1097040	1101200	What we want, most people agree that the most productive, hardest-working people should make
1101200	1107040	more money. And then it's just gone absolutely insane. People really don't recognize just how
1107040	1112000	insane it's gotten. By the way, wealthy people usually don't talk about money because they see
1112000	1116960	this uncouth, which is really nothing but an attempt to keep poor people down by ensuring
1116960	1121120	they don't know how much money they actually are making and have relative to them. So they've
1121120	1126560	created this social dogma around talking about money. I think everyone should talk about how
1126560	1131600	much money they make. I think it's healthy because you're going to find out just how outrageous it
1132320	1137440	is about how some people at a certain level in your company or in society how much money they're
1137440	1146640	making. So for every $100 created in the past 10 years, 54 bucks went to the top 1%. That's globally.
1146640	1153200	It's actually much worse than that in G7 nations and even much worse in the U.S. 70 cents of it
1153200	1159600	went to the bottom half. So about $100, an incremental value created over the last 10 years,
1159600	1166560	70 cents of it went to the bottom half. It used to take 26 billionaires equal to bottom half of
1166560	1173520	America. Now it takes, excuse me, used to take 380 billionaires. Now it takes 26. By the end of next
1173520	1177280	year, there's probably going to be three people in the United States that are worth more than the
1177280	1185520	bottom half of America. That's the bad news. The good news is that incremental quality is usually
1185520	1191200	self-correcting. More bad news is the means of self-correction are usually war, famine, or revolution.
1194400	1198560	Don't you find it unusual that all of these rich people have their go-bags and their bunkers in
1198560	1205280	New Zealand or in Sonoma? I find it so nihilistic and disappointing that the wealthiest, most
1205280	1210880	resource and arguably the most intelligent among us decide to devote their resources to colonizing
1210880	1215440	other planets or taking us into another universe. As opposed to just trying to break this place
1215440	1230080	a little bit more fucking habitable. This is the wealthy weaponizing government. These are tax rates.
1231920	1236000	The greatest innovation in history wasn't the iPhone, wasn't chips, it was the middle class.
1236800	1242640	And that is we had 7 million men coming back from war and we decided to give them money to buy houses
1242640	1248640	and give them jobs, $500 billion infrastructure act, and that made them more attractive to potential
1248640	1257360	mates and we had the baby boom. The tax rate on the top 1% in 1945 was 92% because to sustain
1257360	1262800	the middle class, the greatest innovation in history took a lot of money. And so we recognized
1262800	1267440	that if we wanted a really progressive tax structure, we would have to tax people at a higher
1267440	1271680	rate. And in the spirit of transparency, just to give you a sense of how ridiculous things have
1271680	1278000	gotten, I buy or I start companies, I got very lucky. I sold one of my companies a few years ago.
1278000	1285040	The first $10 million to me, the founder, were tax free. I've invested in another company. I invested
1285040	1290560	two and a half million bucks in another company that just got purchased. The first $25 million to me
1290560	1297120	because of QSB will be tax free, zero tax rate on the first $10 million when you're an entrepreneur
1297760	1303120	or when you make a large capital investment in a small company. And people will say, well, okay,
1303120	1309600	but you're a productive citizen. You wouldn't start companies unless you had these tax breaks.
1309600	1312880	No entrepreneur knows the tax rates when they start a business.
1315120	1321200	My effective tax rate for the last decade has been 17%. That's my effect of tax rate,
1321200	1325760	and I'm very public about that. And there's another myth, and that is that lower and middle
1325760	1329840	income people are paying all the taxes. Actually, they're not. They pay a lot in consumption and
1329840	1335680	sales tax, but they actually pay very little federal income tax. The people who get most
1335680	1342000	screwed by our tax code are what I refer to as the workhorses. And that is they make between
1342000	1348560	$150,000 and a million a year. And it's all reportable. It's all current income. And they're
1348560	1352560	usually in order to make that kind of money have to live in an urban center that's usually a blue
1352560	1356960	state. And they're usually paying an effective tax rate of somewhere between 45% and 50%.
1357920	1362720	And they make enough money to live well. No one feels sorry for them. But until they have enough
1362720	1368400	money to start making investments where they register capital gains, they're paying tax rates of 45%
1368400	1374560	or 50%. Now, if they really start to live large and make a lot of money and can afford to put that
1374560	1380160	money into investments, then they make the jump to light speed. And their tax rate, once they get
1380240	1386720	to about the 99th percentile, starts to plummet. So we've effectively decided that if you win a
1386720	1391760	gold medal, we're going to take the silver and the bronze and give it to you too. Your tax rate
1391760	1398080	goes parabolic. Once you go over six figures, keeps going higher and higher until about a million.
1398640	1402720	And then it absolutely plummets once you get into the top 1%.
1403120	1412960	Luxury is the best business in the world. Wealthiest man in the world
1413680	1419120	didn't invent a search engine or a social media network. He basically creates artificial scarcity.
1420320	1424160	He creates desire. Wealthiest man in the world is, of course, Bernard Arnaud.
1424720	1428080	And these three guys now have wealth greater than the GDP of a bunch of nations.
1428560	1432160	Private flight, private travel won't bore you with this is up. This is an interesting stat and
1432160	1437760	that private luxury usually gains some popularity before an economic crash because people become
1438480	1444400	self-conscious about their wealth. I'm obsessed with succession and this kind of defines sort of
1444400	1450800	quiet luxury. No logos, just very expensive, beautifully crafted things that aren't very flashy.
1451760	1456560	Now, you might say, well, where do billionaires come from? The industry that's created the second
1456560	1460720	most billionaires is actually luxury. Tech has created more.
1464240	1469520	This is the best business in the world and that is creating artificial scarcity. And artificial
1469520	1475280	scarcity is essentially the strategy that unfortunately America has adopted. The strongest
1475840	1483440	brands in the world aren't Apple or Hermes or Nike. They're MIT and Stanford and Harvard.
1484160	1488320	And every day, me and my colleagues wake up and we ask ourselves one question.
1489360	1495200	How can I increase my compensation while reducing my accountability? And the way we do that,
1497760	1504320	the way we do that is we've adopted the ultimate strategy. We target the 0.1% and we adopt this
1504320	1510480	rejectionist exclusionary luxury positioning. And despite the fact we sit on endowments, again,
1510480	1517440	the size of some Latin American GDPs, we don't expand freshman seats. So we can take admissions
1517440	1523600	rates and take them way, way down and turn into a Birkenbag as opposed to public servants.
1525120	1530320	It makes alumni feel good. The value of your degree goes up when it gets harder to get into
1530320	1534960	your institution. The moment you have a house, you start taking an interest in the local review
1534960	1540000	board and basically come up with thoughtful ways to ensure that new housing never gets built.
1541200	1547680	Meaning that housing costs in the US have accelerated about the same price as a luxury
1547680	1551840	good. Once I have a tech company and it works, I'm going to weaponize government to make sure
1551840	1558560	new companies can't get born. Our entire economy has moved to a luxury artificial scarcity economy
1559280	1564800	where we create artificial scarcity to drive up prices that drive value to the incumbents and the
1564800	1576000	entrenched. This is how I explain it. For most of history, our species hasn't had access to
1576000	1580800	sugar, salt, or your fatty foods, so diabetes, right? Our instincts haven't caught up with industrial
1580800	1585600	production. So if you can create something that feels scarce, if you can convince people that
1585600	1591520	a Panerai watch is scarce, right, they artificially choke supply. So if I see one, I think I got to
1591520	1596720	buy one because I want to signal masculinity and strength. I'm dying soon, so I need to signal
1596720	1604240	this type of success, right? And they do a great job of creating art. This is not a difficult thing
1604240	1611680	to produce. It's about 1500 bucks of movement, plastic, glass, and leather that they sell for
1611680	1617920	about 12,000 bucks by creating this illusion of scarcity. When there's a scarcity of food,
1617920	1624000	a scarcity of mating opportunities, and now a scarcity of luxury items or scarcity of education
1624000	1628880	at an elite university, you can raise prices faster than inflation and aggregate a great
1628880	1640080	deal of wealth. And this is the only video I could come up with last night to explain it.
1640080	1657280	Three times last night, somebody here, that gets a plus.
1658080	1660800	Three times last night, someone offered me mushroom chocolates.
1662640	1666240	And I don't know, I don't know if that says something about you or something about me.
1667120	1672320	And the third time I said yes, and I just went back to my room and I watched this video about 80 times.
1679440	1681840	It was a pretty nice way to spend the night. I opened the window,
1682720	1691520	opened the window, kept asking myself, how high am I now? It was really nice. So you're out there and
1691520	1702640	thank you. It's the ultimate marketing strategy, create artificial scarcity, right?
1706000	1710880	And luxury has outperformed every other industry, again, all footing back to a demographic shift,
1710880	1716400	and that is the .1% are aggregating more and more wealth. And you may not feel rich. Every person
1716400	1722480	in this room is probably in the top 10% in their G7 economy. And if you make more than $40,000,
1722480	1729680	you're in the top of 1% globally in terms of income. Tremendous growth potential. This status
1729680	1734960	blew my mind. Hermes now has a larger market capitalization than Nike. Can you believe that?
1737040	1742320	Because most companies, if you can create artificial scarcity, you literally create a cash
1742320	1747680	picket. And I've worked with all of these companies that I'm talking about. I'm going to do a ton
1747680	1754160	of name dropping because I'm deeply insecure and desperate for your affirmation. But essentially,
1754160	1758800	Hermes, go into an Hermes store and say, yeah, I'll take that back. And they're like, oh, sir,
1759760	1767200	that's a three-year waiting list. This shit is not hard to make. These bags are not hard to make,
1767200	1771920	but they have done a genius job of creating a sense of artificial scarcity. So as a result,
1771920	1778160	if the CFO walks into the COO's office in Hermes and says, I need another literally
1778160	1785120	billion dollars in revenue over the next three months, the COO can do it. No problem. Just produce
1785120	1791520	another $15,000 average price point bag. We'll produce another 600,000 bags. There's your billion
1791520	1798480	dollars, 80 points of gross margin, $800 million in gross margin, $400 million in EBITDA. And the
1798480	1804240	analysts know that. So they can perfectly predict and calibrate. They make their projections because
1804240	1809280	if they're about to miss their projections, they just turn on the tap. There's very few companies
1809280	1814320	that are able to establish that type of scarcity or create a cash tap where all they need to do is
1814320	1823360	just open or throttle the spigot. So we've gone from luxury to ultra luxury. I love to travel. I
1823360	1828080	don't travel to cities or countries. I travel to hotels. I find hotels that look great. And that's
1828160	1834080	where I go on vacation. And you have seen basically the Ritz-Carlton, the Four Seasons,
1834080	1839200	which used to be sort of the top luxury brands, be bested. They were sort of for the top three or
1839200	1846320	four percent, but now 0.1 percent brands have come in because that's where a ton of incremental income
1846320	1852320	has happened. So you're seeing hotels where the average price point, the average price point is
1852400	1859840	$7,000 or $9,000 a night. And they're full. So you just have the Four Seasons, the Mandarin
1859840	1866960	Oriental and the Ritz-Carlton. And now you have Cheval and Blanc, Amen, Rosewood, Six Senses have
1866960	1874240	all come in and said no. The opportunity is in the 0.1 percent. So a weird prediction, but I'm
1874240	1878720	obsessed with football. You're going to see a massive increase in the value of sports teams
1879280	1885440	over the next 10 years. One, because as long as we're producing more and more billionaires
1885440	1890880	who happen to be in the midst of the midlife crisis, you're going to see a massive increase
1891600	1897040	in the value of these teams. And you're seeing it now. You're seeing an acceleration of the value
1897760	1905600	of sports teams. One, they actually benefit from some secular trends or structural trends.
1905680	1912400	The only content that doesn't look to be disrupted by, it's the only content we watch live now that
1912400	1919280	advertising still works. And it's also taps into people's emotions. You also have an entire region,
1919280	1926880	the Gulf, that has decided, okay, we need to improve our image. We have to pivot to a non-fossil fuels
1926880	1932160	based economy. We have 30 to 50 years to do that. We have infinite capital. So how do we do that?
1932160	1936000	How do we create a perception such that the most talented people in the world
1936000	1941840	want to come work, live, and be educated here? We have to upgrade our image. There's a smart
1941840	1946960	people they figured out, unlimited resources. So they used to advertise on Bloomberg and CNN and say,
1946960	1953360	invest in Malaysia, Qatar, a great place to live. And what they figured out is if they buy a football
1953360	1959600	team, they get some of that positive brand imagery. And they'll probably break even on a cash flow
1959600	1965440	basis, maybe lose some money. And then in 10, 20, or 30 years, the asset has increased in terminal
1965440	1971840	value. So this is the ultimate brand ROI expenditure if you're trying to upgrade the perception
1972400	1977680	of a country. So we're going to start to see the Gulf nations come into every league, buy leagues,
1977680	1983840	buy teams, because it's as if they could run a commercial. But then in 10 years, they get three
1983840	1992240	times the cost of the commercial back. It's also a fantastic way to cross over celebrity,
1992240	1997600	media, and the value of these things. I would imagine that Ryan Reynolds and Rob are probably
1997600	2001920	going to make five to 10x on their investment just over 24 months on rexom.
2002000	2010480	A little awkward being on his boat.
2014000	2018960	It's the bottom line. Billionaires as they, billionaire Republicans as they realize they're
2018960	2023840	not going to live forever, start buying football teams and billionaire Democrats by media companies.
2024560	2029120	This is kind of the ultimate expression of like you haven't wrapped your head around death yet.
2032320	2036880	I just like to slide.
2042880	2047200	And I'm here to announce that at some point, if I have another 30 or 40 exits, I'm going to buy
2047200	2053280	Rangers FC and Glasgow. I'm going to take my boys. I'm going to be really into the community
2053280	2062480	and they will love me. Okay. So the values of these sports teams is already accelerating.
2063280	2068240	There's going to be investor groups, SPACs. This is going to be kind of a new accelerating
2068240	2073040	luxury item. You're going to see all sorts of new investment opportunities. Someone
2073040	2077520	enterprising will put together a DAO and start buying teams and people like us will have the
2077520	2083040	opportunity to participate. And then I think you're especially going to see it in football.
2083840	2088640	Again, I'm biased here, but I think that these, this league or these teams appear to be global
2088640	2093360	brands or I think they're going to accelerate faster than any other global brands. You're going
2093360	2101040	to start hearing terms like, you know, Arsenal and Inter Milan that you didn't hear before or
2101040	2106800	that most people didn't hear before. These brands are going global. This is shocker. I'm really going
2106800	2114080	on a limb here. I said this a year ago. I have this kind of secret weapon for figuring out if
2114080	2119680	the technology is enduring. And that is I look at the amount of citations in academic journals.
2120560	2128000	And typically what you have is in academia, the whole academic research is really, it's a
2128000	2131280	wonderful thing. It sounds very basic, but it's really a wonderful thing. And that is you put
2131280	2136080	out, you publish something, you say, wow, I think I'm onto something about AI. And you publish it
2136080	2140480	and you publish your thesis and your research. And then someone, a colleague from Carnegie
2140480	2144400	Mellon or Tulane says, this is what you got right. And this is what you got wrong. And I'm going to
2144400	2148880	refute it. And if they can refute it, we actually celebrate them as long as they add value to it.
2148880	2152800	And we congratulate them. We still don't start shit posting each other on Twitter. We say,
2152800	2157840	okay, what you're saying is right. You've made my research better. And we have an enduring build
2157840	2162640	of intellectual property that ideally then floats into the private sector. And as you can see in
2162640	2168160	mobile and GPS, that build was slow and steady. And I would argue the mobile and GPS are probably
2168160	2174880	the most enduring technology of the last 30 years. Now, in contrast, let's look at the academic
2174880	2184560	research and citations of the metaverse and crypto. Right? Me and my colleagues, oh, the metaverse is
2184560	2193600	hot. Right? Oh, crypto, it's hot. Right? And then this is what happens. It just dies.
2196560	2204000	Look at the curve and artificial intelligence. It's very similar to the curve of mobile and GPS.
2204960	2210800	And I can't find any other technology that has the same citations or the same curve
2211360	2220480	of this, the most enduring technology other than AI. So every academic journal entry
2222160	2226400	has been improved upon. We've been thinking and talking and writing about this for a long time
2226400	2232400	and researching it. And it continues to get better and better and better in this, in my view, is in
2232400	2238160	fact an enduring technology. Every year, I'm a glass half empty kind of guy. I'm better at predicting
2238160	2243120	when technologies don't work. I have every year kind of the most ridiculous technology award.
2243120	2249280	Two years ago, it was the metaverse. Right? 40% of people who put on that headset feel nauseous
2249280	2256640	within 30 minutes. No one wants to go into an in cell panic room. These things, I think big tech
2256640	2262720	is a net positive for the world. I do not believe that of meta. And I could not have invented a
2262720	2270080	better strategy than to convince a young man to spend $1.2 billion a month on his big go
2270080	2274720	by a wasca dreams that people are going to want to go into a legless universe and hang out with
2274720	2281360	him and other people. I think we all have an obligation. If you, like me, think the people
2281360	2287920	who run meta are mendacious fox, I think that you have an obligation to talk up the metaverse.
2288640	2294320	Because my fear is they wake up from this consensual hallucination and start reducing the spend.
2295200	2296960	So I think it has real potential.
2307520	2313360	Five days to one million users, right? The curve on adoption and AI is blowing away everything.
2313920	2322400	We are in the fear-mongering part of the cycle. I am actually quite optimistic about AI,
2322400	2329280	which stands out, I think. And by the way, I trust on who I adore and have a lot of respect for,
2329280	2333840	is worried about this and I purposely wanted to go to his talk yesterday to get insight into why
2333840	2338800	he is worried about it. But what I see is that every new technology, it is easier to understand
2338800	2344320	the downsides, right? We knew that automation was going to fire a lot of people on the factory
2344320	2349120	floor and it did in the short term. But we did not anticipate heated seats or car stereos and
2349120	2353680	net employment in the automobile industry actually went up. And so, yeah, I think there is going
2353680	2358000	to be some job destruction. I think there will be some security risks. But the amount of new
2358000	2363360	businesses and opportunities by feeding your health records or spending patterns into these
2363360	2367360	LLMs, you are going to come up with all sorts of new businesses and new ideas.
2371760	2377680	Okay. I am going to skip this. Obviously, we had kind of peak hype cycle.
2379200	2383520	Everyone is talking about AI, right? It kind of reminds me of 99 when you just said,
2383520	2390720	Williamsonoma.com and your stock price went up. And everyone is trying to figure out on the dark
2390720	2396880	side here what industries it really destroys. So the Czech CEO made the mistake of saying that
2396880	2402560	he felt some pressure from chat GPT in the stock loss, 40% of its value in five minutes in the
2402560	2408240	aftermarket. So investor relations has really now become a story of spin. The number of journalists
2408240	2413440	over the last 30 years has been cut in half. The number of corporate PR executives, the number
2413440	2419920	of comms people at companies has gone up six-fold. So the ratio of bullshit to journalism has gone
2419920	2426240	the wrong way, 12X. The reason why is that three out of four companies that went public 30 years
2426240	2431280	ago were profitable. And we would assign a multiple within a fairly narrow range to get the valuation.
2432000	2437120	Now three and four companies that go public are not profitable, or at least over the last 10 years,
2437120	2442880	which means the narrative is more important than the numbers. So the core competence of every CEO
2442880	2448000	is to be a great storyteller and capture people's imagination, pull cheap capital forward such that
2448000	2454480	he or she can overinvest and run away from the competition. So as a result, the PR and comms
2454480	2460240	people manicuring Zuckerberg's image at Facebook now outnumber the number of journalists at the
2460240	2467760	Washington Post. Think about that. There's more people trying to kind of put wallpaper over these
2467760	2473120	lies that delay an obfuscation that is meta than there are journalists at the Washington Post.
2473520	2480960	Typically, technology is easy to create a bunch of new winners or they accrete to the existing
2480960	2486880	players, right? Search, socially commerce went to new players, mobile went to existing players,
2486880	2492000	you would argue cloud kind of went to existing players. So far it looks like the big bursts
2492000	2495920	of market capitalization are going to existing players because it requires substantial
2495920	2498800	infrastructure, specifically massive processing power.
2499360	2507680	Coming back to travel, I think there's enormous opportunities in travel and AI. I'm going to the
2507680	2513360	Eurofinals with my 12-year-old and we're playing with AI to try and create the ultimate weekend.
2513360	2519120	But you can see how this would be a tremendous time savings. Again, going back to time machines
2519680	2527280	to plan a great weekend. Give me a great weekend with six of my friends, all women in our 30s.
2527280	2531360	We want to go to Mexico. This is our economic weight class. These are our priorities and it
2531360	2535520	comes back with an itinerary. And then a series of questions. What else can I answer for you?
2536080	2540720	Do you want me to make reservations? Confirm now. Do you want me to send emails out to the six
2540720	2545360	friends? I mean, you can just see this is going to get really exciting, very fast in travel.
2546080	2558640	Okay. I had my first AI moment at LAX when I was coming in and I went to global entry and I
2558640	2563360	started putting my passport in and I heard Galloway and I'm a narcissist so I thought,
2563360	2570560	oh, it's a fan. And it was a woman from TSA saying, you're good. And so they're doing
2570560	2576000	facial recognition and learning on AI such that you can get right through the airport. I think
2576000	2581760	that's fantastic. By the way, I'm all for privacy violation as long as we have strong courts and
2581760	2586560	people to oversee or punish companies when they abuse that data. But the notion that if you give
2586560	2591360	a flying fuck about privacy is hilarious. As you'll tell everybody exactly what you're doing
2591360	2597520	everywhere. With a thin layer of AI, if Uber gets hacked, we're going to know if you're having an
2597520	2603920	affair, your HIV status, and if you terminated a pregnancy. It is going to be, you have given up
2603920	2612240	all privacy. This is the industry that AI will disrupt. And it's because it's the most disruptable
2612240	2618800	industry. The way to describe American healthcare is expensive and bad. It's outpaced inflation.
2619440	2626160	It is now the largest industry in our economy and only 20% of healthcare consumers are happy
2626160	2630160	with their healthcare. Think about that. It's raised prices faster than inflation for 30 or 40
2630160	2637440	years, and only one in five consumers are happy with their healthcare. We spend $12,000 per person
2637440	2646720	on healthcare. I mean, about Australia spends less than five. And yet we die much earlier. Think
2646720	2653520	about that. Mostly through death of despair, opioid addiction, suicide, right? But think about
2653520	2659360	just how ridiculous it is and also obesity, but that we have a nation that spends a lot
2659360	2665040	more than anyone else, and yet we're dying earlier. And again, terrible satisfaction.
2666240	2671120	So again, it's more about how disruptable an industry is than the technology itself. And I
2671120	2677520	think you're going to see, if I just was an economic animal, strong certification, some decent
2678240	2682720	options professionally, and I thought, where is the most wind going to be in my sail?
2682720	2689120	I would try and position myself somewhere between AI and healthcare, right? Where you feed in your
2689120	2696080	workouts, your nutrition, here's just my grocery bills. Here's my fitness app. Here's my AmEx receipts.
2696720	2701760	And here's my blood work. And I want this AI model to start managing my healthcare
2702480	2707440	and making recommendations and take healthcare from a defensive on your heels disease driven
2708400	2713600	application to an offensive health driven. And I think there's going to be all sorts of costs.
2713600	2720000	I don't have health insurance. And people hear that and they go, whoa, no health insurance.
2720800	2725840	Because health insurance for me and my family for the health insurance I want is $50,000 a year.
2727200	2732560	And because I have some economic security, I can absorb a big health scare. I could absorb almost
2732560	2738720	any health scare. And so I decided, all right, about 50% of our healthcare costs are not being
2738720	2744560	reimbursed. So I'm going to go without health insurance. I did that five years ago, a quarter
2744560	2749120	of a million dollars will buy a lot of healthcare. So what the healthcare industry has done,
2749120	2752480	especially the health insurance, the insurance part of the industry, which I think is the most
2752480	2758880	vulnerable 45% of all insurance costs in healthcare go to profits and administration,
2758880	2764320	meaning if you spent $100 on health insurance, you're getting $55 back. If you're a younger person,
2764320	2769840	you don't get $55, you get more like 25 or 35, because you're subsidizing people my age and older.
2771200	2776560	But we scare you. You're irresponsible. And what if you get really sick?
2778160	2783840	So again, it's another example of a very elegant transfer of wealth from young people to old people.
2784640	2791120	Under the same auspices of rejectionism or capital gains tax that rewards money more than sweat.
2791760	2795920	Who makes money off money? People my age. Who makes money off sweat? People your age.
2796800	2802560	Second biggest tax deduction in America, mortgage interest. Who owns homes? People my age. Who rents?
2802560	2809440	People your age. People over the age of 70 are 72% wealthier than they were 40 years ago. People
2809440	2815760	under the age of 40 in America are 24% less wealthy. Almost everything we do in America
2815760	2822000	is an elegant transfer of wealth from young people to old people. And we wonder why there's a birth
2822000	2827600	birth rates are off 20% in the last five years. And everyone's staring at their navels saying,
2827600	2830480	why young people having kids? It's because they can't afford them.
2837280	2838160	Want to see that again?
2841280	2848080	All right. We need a time machine in healthcare. Whoever builds it is going to make billions.
2848080	2852960	Right now it takes two hours for an in-person visit. A telehealth visit takes 13 to 15 minutes.
2852960	2857280	This is an enormous on-line. The mother of a child with diabetes, and let's be honest,
2857280	2862960	it's always the mom, spends five months of her year managing that child's healthcare. Think
2862960	2867920	about that. If a child with diabetes between the referrals, the applications, the insurance,
2867920	2870640	you spend five months of your year managing that child's healthcare.
2873200	2880960	The pandemic did bring an acceleration in remote healthcare. Only about less than 3% of visits
2881520	2888000	were remote. It went almost to 40% during the pandemic. It's come down, but it's still an enduring
2888000	2895920	part of our healthcare system remote visits. 38%. It's a huge unlock in mental health.
2897200	2902240	This is especially dominant or as seen as a real innovation in the mental health sector.
2903440	2906240	I think it's going to be big in fitness. I'm going to spend a lot of time there.
2907200	2913360	I'm going to cut to the end. I decided it would be fun to talk about space tourism being on a
2913360	2921280	Virgin boat. I think this is the most ridiculous business anywhere. Virgin Galactic was nothing
2921280	2926560	but an elegant transfer of wealth from retail investors who wanted to participate in the
2926560	2931040	FOMO tech economy such that Richard Branson could keep this ship operating during COVID.
2932000	2941040	We spent more time just got very awkward in here. We spent more time watching Jeff Bezos go
2941040	2949440	up in a dildo than talking about climate change in 2022. When Bob from accounting gets
2949440	2955360	emulated on the launch pad, this entire industry goes away. It is supposed to apply constraint and
2955360	2960480	demand constraint. There aren't that many people want to spend $400,000 to go three times as high
2960480	2968480	as you'll go on your way home. Space is really, really difficult. There's a reason they call it
2968480	2975840	space. It doesn't want you there. It immediately begins destroying material and basically attacking
2975840	2984880	any organism. It's a terrible business. Space exploration, another ridiculous business,
2984960	2990720	ridiculous idea. You've got to hand it to them. The view on Mars will take your breath away.
2991920	2994480	Literally, it will take your breath away. You can't breathe there.
2996960	2999200	This is the weather here. This is the weather on Mars.
3004240	3010320	Also, if you're a responsible person, you should absolutely take up base jumping before you go
3010320	3015760	into space. 550 people have gone into space. 11 have not come back. It has about 10 times the
3015760	3021280	mortality rate of base jumping. It's a very dangerous business. The part of space that
3021280	3028160	does make sense is space hauling, specifically space hacks. We need to get more defense and
3028160	3033120	communication equipment. It's essentially who can get things up reliably and cheaply. I think
3033120	3039680	space hacks is going to be more valuable than Tesla, mostly because Tesla's value will implode.
3039680	3045680	It's a car company, not a software or an energy company, but space hacks has figured out a way
3045680	3053120	to get heavy materials into orbit much more cost-effectively. I'm going to skip through this.
3054400	3059520	Loneliness. You've heard a lot about this this weekend. I'm working with Surgeon General Vivek
3059520	3068000	Murti, who is a very impressive and lovely man. Anytime you take one substance and transfer it
3068640	3073120	or transition it to another, there's externalities. Anytime you take X and turn it into Y for
3073120	3077840	economic gain, you're going to get externalities. We turn plant-based calories into beef-based
3077840	3083840	calories. We get methane and deforestation. We take fossil fuels and we turn them into petroleum.
3083840	3090320	Obviously, we get externalities in the form of carbon. I do not believe that carbon emissions
3090320	3094960	and climate change are the most serious threat facing humanity. I think there's another
3094960	3099840	externality that has arisen because of a conversion of one substance to another that is a
3099840	3107600	bigger threat. That is the conversion from advertising into dollars or specifically from
3107600	3114400	attention into advertising into dollars. Because what we figured out in the 50s, 60s, and 70s,
3114400	3119840	we thought it was sex that would keep you glued to your screen. What we have found out is that the
3119840	3126960	real sex that sells isn't sex, it's rage. As a result, the companies that are now
3129680	3134240	building the most shareholder value are the ones that basically are in the business of polarizing
3134240	3139600	and dividing and depressing. Why do I think it's the most dangerous emission? If we all hate each
3139600	3144800	other, we're never going to figure out a way to come to any sort of agreement or action plan around
3144800	3149520	the other things that ale us because we don't trust each other. The moment one group takes a
3149520	3155520	position on something, there's reason for the other group to suspect them and gas like them
3155520	3161120	or basically not believe it. It doesn't matter what it is. We used to be bipartisan around science,
3161920	3167760	but I know the algorithms like it when I say mRNA vaccines all to your DNA. We like that,
3167760	3173360	elevate that content because it pisses people off. We'll get more comments, more engagement,
3173360	3178880	more enragement, more engagement, more Nissan ads. The result is depression.
3182160	3190000	One in three teenage girls have contemplated suicide. One in five LGBTQ youth have attempted
3190000	3195760	suicide. I went back to my old high school, university high school in West Los Angeles a few
3195760	3202720	weeks ago, 2,000 kids, assuming somewhere between five and 10% identify as LGBTQ. It's 200. That
3202720	3207280	means 40 kids over the next three years are going to try and kill themselves.
3208640	3212640	When I was in high school, we had a memorial almost every weekend or every week we come in.
3212640	3218400	We'd say, oh no, we'd see a picture of somebody and a bunch of flowers and it was from almost always
3218400	3223760	it was from drunk driving. When I grew up, I lived in LA. There was no public transportation, huge
3223760	3229120	alcohol abuse, no airbags, mothers against drunk driving really hadn't kicked in and kids would
3229120	3236000	take to Sunset Avenue totally fucked up and get in an accident with no collapsible steering wheel
3236000	3243200	shaft or airbags and we had death all the time. Now it's no longer drunkenness or cars, it's depression.
3248000	3254080	The fear I do have around AI is that I worry that young people are entering into a series
3254640	3260560	of low risk, low payoff relationships. I'm going to convince myself I'm learning and that I'm
3260560	3265600	investing and I'm going to go on Coinbase. I'm going to convince myself I'm politically engaged
3265600	3271520	by going on Twitter. I'm going to convince myself I have friends but I'm not really experiencing
3271520	3277360	friendship and I think slowly but surely especially young men who have very few mating opportunities
3277440	3284480	because online dating is kind of consolidated mating where the top 5% of males get 80% of
3284480	3292400	the opportunities. They're going to engage in a low risk, easy, low barrier of relationships
3293120	3300640	with sex bots and AI trained girlfriends and I think this ultimately over time makes us depressed
3301440	3305280	that the reason we're happy, the reason we're joyous is we engage in victory.
3306160	3312480	We have obstacles that make the destination or the relationship more rewarding. There's a reason
3312480	3320320	the romantic comedies are 2 hours not 10 minutes. Supposedly if you or there's new research showing
3320320	3327360	if you smoked and had friends right or didn't smoke and had no friends you would live longer
3327360	3335040	if you smoked a pack a day and had friends and now 1 in 7 males don't have a single friend.
3336720	3340560	Now I mean think about that. Think about the amount of joy, think about the
3340560	3346160	prosperity, just a sense of self-worth, the laughter you've experienced with friends and 1
3346160	3352160	in 7 males in America doesn't have a single friend. I'm not going to play the clip on her
3353040	3358000	so I'm worried that slowly but surely we're going to start to replace human touch and what it means
3358000	3365200	to be a mammal and decide that you know trying to meet people is hard. Having the confidence to
3365200	3370640	approach someone and express romantic relationship while making them feel safe is a skill that young
3370640	3377600	men aren't establishing and so they'll turn to AI and slowly but surely they'll sequester themselves
3378160	3381360	from the rest of the world which I think leads to depression.
3384000	3388000	There's a woman who's now turned herself into a scalable girlfriend and she expects to make
3388000	3396240	five million dollars a month charging a buck a minute. I love this quote right it kind of
3396240	3401920	summarizes it all what is love if it's not grief persevering most of my philosophy I get from Disney
3402000	3412080	plus okay this is my last thing I'm a bit of a downer so let's try to end with some up note if
3412080	3417520	you look at our catastrophizing and how down we become about the world and how bad things
3417520	3422640	become a lot of it is the cadence of the news cycle news used to be 22 minutes once a day
3423200	3428800	then it turned into 20 hours and now that it's every 20 seconds on your phone with notifications
3428800	3435200	the only way to keep you on your screen is to catastrophize right things marginally better
3435200	3440560	today is not a good headline that doesn't work right so we want to create we have to create a
3440560	3445600	situation for the situation room so we constantly catastrophize and make ourselves feel worse about
3445600	3450640	the world in each other so if you looked and just took if you just took the perspective back and said
3450640	3455440	all right last year here's where the biggest headlines any headline you get every 20 seconds
3455440	3460080	is usually not a good headline but what if you went back five years still kind of bad
3461760	3466960	can anyone hear that or am I having a stroke it's like a rumbling thanks for that
3470560	3476400	if you went if you went back 50 years if you went one five ten the news if you had to pick
3476400	3480320	headlines the news gets progressively better the more perspective you have perspective is a
3480320	3485280	photographic term and the more you create the angle wider the better the news gets because the
3485280	3489200	reality is if you're honest with yourself and you look at anything from a long-term perspective
3489200	3494080	the news just gets hard to hard to deny it's pretty good what would the news be if you had one headline
3494080	3500800	for the last 50 years probably be unprecedented prosperity led by china in the us or that abject
3500800	3505600	poverty has been cut by 80 percent if you could only pick one or two headlines you'd have no choice
3505600	3509200	but probably to make them positive and if you could only have one headline for the last hundred
3509200	3517520	years what would it be that's a very good one life expectancy in china since the year i was
3517520	3523520	born has gone from 46 to now 76 and 500 million people have been bought out brought out of poverty
3523520	3528080	in china over the last 30 years but still i think that probably the headline for the last
3528080	3532800	hundred years would be that the west turned back fascism which is a great headline so as the cadence
3532800	3538160	of news has increased our sentiment has gone further and further down and we need some means of
3538240	3543840	self-correcting around all this negativity okay i'm not going to talk about how great it is to be
3543840	3553680	an american i think a lot about regrets in time and how fast it's barreling the majority of our
3553680	3560720	existence as a species we didn't live past 34 for about 99.9 percent of our time as homo sapiens
3560720	3567280	we lived to be about 30 or 34 we died in childbirth died in war conflict a broken bone or a bad cut
3567520	3574640	death so our brains literally can't process us past the age of 35 or 40 by the way by the time you
3574640	3581520	hit 38 you have trouble adapting to the way you look after that every day you look in the mirror
3581520	3588240	you're like shit because you can't process it because you're not supposed to be here in addition
3588960	3596160	you can't you can't get your mind around time and ask anyone in this audience over the age of 40
3596160	3603120	time literally begins to fall off a cliff years become seasons and i'm fascinated with what are
3603120	3606960	the biggest regrets at the end of your life my colleague adam alters done great work on this
3606960	3611920	and i only got another minute or so here and he does he spends a lot of time with people at the
3611920	3617200	end in palliative care and their regrets basically boil down to three things i wish i'd live the
3617200	3622160	life i wanted to live not the life that others wanted me to live i wish i'd stayed in touch with
3622160	3626880	friends and most importantly i wish i'd been less hard on myself i wish i'd forgiven myself
3628160	3632880	i think about this a lot is i'm barreling towards the end i'm an atheist i think at some point
3632880	3636400	i'll look into my kids eyes and know that our relationship is coming to an end and i find
3636400	3641840	it a source of power but if you're successful you live a lot in the past you call on your
3641840	3646720	credentials and your experience to try and inform your current actions and if you're like me and you
3646720	3651520	suffer from depression and anger you spend the majority of your waking hours in the past
3652160	3656080	god i can't believe what a fucking idiot i am i can't believe i did that i can't believe i said
3656080	3663680	that you're constantly beating yourself up right can't can't get past this immutable thing called
3663680	3670320	the past just can't get past it and if you're successful also also like me you're a lot in
3670320	3675120	the future you're constantly trading off the short term you're constantly planning i got on this
3675120	3680640	boat yesterday because i was supposed to speak at 330 i don't like boats i've never been on one
3680640	3686960	before i'm agoraphobic i don't like people much and so when i saw the boat was still docked i thought
3686960	3691920	i'm going to do this talk and bomb to miami airport get home and i was already planning
3691920	3696880	the tottenham spurs brentford game with my sons and what i was going to do with my free time i was
3696880	3701760	already in the future planning how to be more productive and chances are if i'd made that
3701760	3707040	football game i would have been on my phone virtue signaling that i was with my son checking the
3707040	3713600	amount of likes i got thinking about what i was going to do the next day never really there right
3713600	3719200	never you know always in the future always in the past never really there i like what sam harris
3719200	3724960	says the past is the most immutable thing in the world the future is the most mutable thing
3724960	3730640	unfortunately we don't have a lot of we don't have a lot of control over it but this is it this is
3730720	3735600	what we this is it this is the only really the only thing we have is the here and the now
3736400	3743200	and my biggest fear and i think about this a lot is that i'll be at the end and i'll look back and
3743200	3751760	i'll go oh my god unbelievable blessings staggering prosperity that i didn't expect people i love and
3751760	3758640	love me immensely right but i was never really there for it
3761440	3768240	and did my life happen so i leave us with a question
3769200	3774160	and it's something i ask myself all the time now are you here
3778960	3779600	that's all i got
3781760	3782660	you
