Welcome to the stage, Optimist, Author, and Founder of the Curve, Simon Sinek.

00:07.520 --> 00:16.640
Yes. Thank you. Thank you very much. So obviously you're all here for Scott Galloway.

00:20.560 --> 00:26.320
Scott is one of those people who pushes you to see the world differently. It's one of the reasons

00:26.320 --> 00:32.400
I love him and love his work. He also puts himself out there in a way that I think very,

00:32.400 --> 00:40.240
very few others can or want to. He's so vulnerable and shares with us the struggles that he's going

00:40.240 --> 00:46.880
through that we can relate to. But more important, his views on the world, his perspective on how it

00:46.880 --> 00:51.200
works are different than everybody else, which is why we have to listen to Scott. He doesn't always get

00:51.200 --> 00:57.600
his predictions right, but we have to listen. Ladies and gentlemen, Scott Galloway.

01:00.880 --> 01:08.160
Thanks. Thank you. My name is Scott Galloway. I teach at NYU. I have 147 slides and

01:10.800 --> 01:14.560
2400 seconds, so let's light this candle. So in the spirit of transparency,

01:15.680 --> 01:20.160
I don't know Simon how well I don't like him very much, but it's a power move to have him introduce

01:20.160 --> 01:30.240
me. Okay, so I got home pretty late last night and decided to reorient the slides. I fiddled with

01:30.240 --> 01:34.560
the slides up until the time I present them, and I thought given that we're on a cruise ship,

01:35.200 --> 01:38.880
and I met a lot of people last night who are in the business of travel that we would try and talk

01:38.880 --> 01:43.600
about. Travel, I'll make some predictions around tech. It's kind of around the world

01:43.600 --> 01:48.240
towards basically whatever I just wanted to talk about tonight. And then hopefully we'll leave

01:48.240 --> 01:51.760
some time for my favorite part, Q&A. We have a pretty intimate crowd here tonight,

01:51.760 --> 01:56.560
so I'm going to try and leave some time for Q&A. Okay, we're going to talk about the economy,

01:57.600 --> 02:01.760
travel, transportation, what else, because we didn't get enough of that today,

02:03.200 --> 02:09.280
income inequality. I'm worried about the shit I've created after I've made tens of millions of dollars,

02:10.400 --> 02:16.880
but I'm Dr. Frankenstein, and I think Frank might have some violent tendencies. I'm concerned.

02:16.880 --> 02:21.680
Yeah, fuck you, figure out what we do. I'm going to talk about loneliness,

02:23.280 --> 02:26.000
and then I'm going to try and wrap up with, quote unquote, some perspective.

02:27.520 --> 02:31.120
So if you weren't reading every day that we were about to have a recession,

02:31.120 --> 02:37.200
where would the evidence of any recession be? I think that inflation is going to come down

02:37.200 --> 02:43.760
as quickly as it went up. AI, the rider's strike, which will end in tears for the riders.

02:44.720 --> 02:49.600
For the first time, people are not as confident negotiating pet bereavement leave and the growth

02:49.600 --> 02:55.200
economy. I think you're about to see wage pressure come way down, and you're about to see inflation

02:56.160 --> 03:04.160
come way down, back to historic or more normal levels. And I'm not sure. I studied economics,

03:04.160 --> 03:11.440
but I don't consider myself an economist, but I don't see any signs of a recession. As I said,

03:11.520 --> 03:18.800
inflation is coming way down. Unemployment is at historic lows. Now, some people would argue,

03:18.800 --> 03:24.160
well, there's discouraged workers, you have the wrong denominator here, but we essentially have

03:24.800 --> 03:30.000
historically low unemployment, retail sales are strong. We've ripped through about four to five

03:30.000 --> 03:33.920
trillion dollars we handed out during the pandemic, and we're ripping through another

03:33.920 --> 03:38.400
hundred billion a month. So there is some credence to the argument. I'm trying to stand over here,

03:38.480 --> 03:42.800
that in about 10 months, people are going to run out of money. But right now, it doesn't appear

03:43.360 --> 03:48.400
unless you were looking at the media that you'd see any real signals that were going into a

03:48.400 --> 03:53.680
recession. All of a sudden, we're starting to see people talk about earnings calls or in earnings

03:53.680 --> 03:58.800
calls use the term soft landing as opposed to recession. They're even starting to soften their

03:58.800 --> 04:05.280
tone. There's an effect that when you worry about something or the moment you really begin to start

04:05.280 --> 04:09.840
worrying about something, the odds of it happening go way down, right? It's the shit you don't see

04:09.840 --> 04:14.880
coming that gets you. None of us really saw the pandemic coming. Remember Greek sovereign debt

04:14.880 --> 04:18.480
that was supposedly going to collapse and take down all of Europe or that all elevators were

04:18.480 --> 04:25.280
going to start stop working New Year's 2000. It's a general survival instinct that if you worry about

04:25.280 --> 04:31.040
something long enough, you unconsciously prepare for it and you avoid it. So we have been talking

04:31.040 --> 04:35.120
so much about the recession that I wonder if we're probably not going to, it's not going to

04:35.120 --> 04:40.560
register. Where we are seeing a recession is what I call the Patagonia vest recession.

04:44.800 --> 04:50.480
I have two entries. I'm credited with two entries in the urban dictionary. The first is yoga babble,

04:50.480 --> 04:57.040
which is how I describe the we work prospectus. And then I just got my second one and that is the

04:57.040 --> 05:04.160
Patagonia vest recession. And that is the growth economy has had so many calories stuffed down.

05:04.240 --> 05:09.840
It's esophagus that it's built up fatty deposits everywhere. And if you understand

05:09.840 --> 05:14.880
balance sheet economics, essentially, if you have gross margins of 20%, which is great gross

05:14.880 --> 05:21.120
margins or operating margins, excuse me, of 20%, you can either add $5 a new income of new revenue

05:21.120 --> 05:26.000
to your company, or you can cut a dollar of expenses. And you have the same net effect on

05:26.000 --> 05:32.160
shareholder value. So the most actionable or significant on the ground impact or strategy

05:32.160 --> 05:39.040
of 2023 isn't AI, it isn't supply chain. It's everybody in every boardroom has seen what Elon

05:39.040 --> 05:45.040
Musk has done. Specifically, he's fired 80% of his staff. He's taken the step down from 7500

05:45.040 --> 05:50.640
people to 1800, he's going to 1000. And there really isn't from the consumer in any discernible

05:50.640 --> 05:56.880
impact on the product. Now, he's lost about 80% of us or 60 to 80% of his advertising revenue,

05:56.880 --> 06:01.520
but people would argue that's a self inflicted wound. So in every board, people are asking

06:01.520 --> 06:08.080
themselves how do we have the great taste of reduced costs without the calories of losing

06:08.080 --> 06:13.440
revenue. So the business strategy circulating the majority of the growth economy is could we

06:13.440 --> 06:19.600
lay out 10, 20, 30% of our employees, but manage to hold on to the majority of our revenues. That

06:19.600 --> 06:24.480
is the easiest way to add shareholder value and the markets like it every time a company announces

06:24.480 --> 06:30.000
layoffs, the stock goes up. The majority of people in this room have never really seen that type of

06:30.000 --> 06:35.040
economy before. When I graduated from business school, 40% of my class had a job. So in other

06:35.040 --> 06:39.920
words, 60%, two thirds of the class did not have a single job. My kids now when I say kids,

06:39.920 --> 06:44.880
I mean my students on average have between three and five job offers out of NYU Stern,

06:44.880 --> 06:50.560
average salary $212,000. Meaning if someone goes to work for a nonprofit for 100th grand,

06:50.560 --> 06:58.720
there's somebody who's accepted a job at 330 or $350,000. That is much different. That is no one

06:58.720 --> 07:03.360
ever feels overpaid. The majority of us in this room right now are overpaid.

07:06.240 --> 07:11.600
Oh, I do have sound. If in the back, if you can hear this video, this video does have sound.

07:11.600 --> 07:15.760
This is one of my favorite videos to kind of summarize the growth economy.

07:28.720 --> 07:50.480
Can you imagine the fight over who would get to fire this person?

07:58.960 --> 08:08.320
I have 300 kids in my class, about 30 or 40 of them go to work for Amazon, about 20 Google.

08:08.320 --> 08:13.840
Literally big tech was coming in every year and hoovering up all human capital. It was a fight.

08:13.840 --> 08:17.840
Like every manager's job usually at the end of the year, and I run growth companies,

08:17.840 --> 08:24.720
is how do we keep the young people happy, right? It was just a constant question. How do we keep

08:24.720 --> 08:32.320
people with us? How do we attract new people? That has flipped. I love these TikToks now of

08:32.320 --> 08:38.320
people getting fired that day. My first piece of advice, because I don't think many of you have

08:38.320 --> 08:45.280
been fired before. I've been fired from every job I've ever had. It's not about you. It's not a

08:46.720 --> 08:51.200
statement on your character. It's not about the condition of your soul. It's usually about things

08:51.200 --> 08:56.000
outside of your control. I think the tech community and the labor force was lying to you when they

08:56.000 --> 09:00.320
said, bring your full self to work. Don't bring your politics to work. No one gives a shit about

09:00.320 --> 09:06.000
your politics. Corporations are a platform to build economic security for you and your family,

09:06.000 --> 09:11.040
and they might have pretended that they cared, but they don't. Don't think that when you get

09:11.040 --> 09:15.840
fired or laid off, it's an assessment on you. No, it's not. It's about what's happening at the

09:15.840 --> 09:22.000
time in the economy, almost always. You've got to put these layoffs in context, though. They make

09:22.000 --> 09:29.680
for great headlines. Huge headlines. Amazon, Meta lays off 8,000 people from page. But this is how

09:29.680 --> 09:34.720
many people they've hired since the beginning of the pandemic. So all these, quote, unquote,

09:34.720 --> 09:39.520
mass firings are just taking them back to employment levels of 12 or 18 months ago.

09:40.160 --> 09:44.880
This is still just a fraction of the people that human capital that they have brought into their

09:44.880 --> 09:52.320
organizations in the last 36 months. The layoffs here, despite all the headlines, represent about

09:52.320 --> 09:58.720
1% of non-farm payroll employment. We're obsessed with big tech, but it relates to the economy in

09:58.720 --> 10:02.800
terms of market capitalization. It's big, but it's employment. It actually doesn't employ that many

10:02.800 --> 10:11.520
people. 2023, the year of experiences. So if you looked at most things, most structural trends,

10:11.520 --> 10:16.480
whether it's e-commerce, even teen depression. And you didn't know the pandemic had happened,

10:16.480 --> 10:20.880
and it just maintained its current slope. Teen depression has been going up steadily since the

10:20.880 --> 10:25.840
introduction of social on mobile. E-commerce has been growing high, single, low, double digits per

10:25.840 --> 10:30.880
year. They've all kind of returned to where they would have been around the pandemic. The only thing

10:30.880 --> 10:36.720
that appears to be the enduring change is work from home. That appears to be very, very sticky.

10:36.720 --> 10:40.560
That's kind of the enduring change coming out of COVID, where if someone showed up and said,

10:40.560 --> 10:45.280
how is the world different? How do we know something happened here? It would be remote work.

10:45.280 --> 10:50.960
And the really disappointing work, or the Gene Twanging and Jonathan High just came out with,

10:50.960 --> 10:56.320
is that we've been blaming depression of kids on COVID. And the reality is, if you look at the

10:56.320 --> 11:03.040
trends of teen depression, what they found is, it wasn't COVID. It was social media that was doing

11:03.040 --> 11:08.720
it. And some social distancing didn't create depression among teens. Social media did.

11:11.120 --> 11:15.360
Ton of revenge travel, right? One of the wonderful things about coming out of COVID is people seem

11:15.360 --> 11:21.360
to have a renewed sense of what's important, the finite nature of life, and people are going big

11:21.360 --> 11:27.520
in terms of travel. Travel sites traffic up dramatically. New record for passports that

11:27.520 --> 11:33.120
have been issued in the United States. China's returning to the tourism market. So that's new

11:33.120 --> 11:38.640
wind in the sails. And people are spending a greater proportion of their disposable income

11:39.440 --> 11:47.520
on travel. And then we're seeing huge demand returning. For the most part, the travel industry

11:47.520 --> 11:53.120
is taking advantage of this. And using COVID as an excuse not to restore previous service levels,

11:53.120 --> 11:57.040
I get to stay in very nice places, mostly because someone else is paying. And the way I would describe

11:57.040 --> 12:03.280
luxury travel right now is six star prices with four star service. And as a result, their margins

12:03.280 --> 12:07.840
have never been bigger. They're making up for the revenues that they were, that they lost through

12:07.840 --> 12:10.400
COVID. It's a great time to be in the travel business.

12:13.360 --> 12:17.680
Live entertainment is surging. People want to be around each other, which is a wonderful thing.

12:18.640 --> 12:23.440
And also people have a renewed sense of the value of time versus money.

12:25.600 --> 12:30.720
Okay, so everything in its own way is retail. And I would argue that the worst retail experiences

12:30.720 --> 12:36.480
are grocery stores, airports and gas stations. Tesla didn't disrupt the auto industry, it disrupted

12:36.480 --> 12:43.120
the gas station. If you spent 15 minutes a week in a gas station, that's 12 and a half hours a year

12:43.120 --> 12:48.480
pulling in, smelling those carcinogens, worrying about getting shot. That is literally the worst

12:48.480 --> 12:55.680
retail experience in America. How much would someone have to pay you to get up at six, get to the

12:55.680 --> 13:01.360
gas station at seven in the morning, fill up, drive around the block and do that until seven

13:01.360 --> 13:08.000
30 at night? You would probably pay a lot of money to avoid that. In addition, this industry

13:08.000 --> 13:13.040
was so disruptible, mostly because of charging stations or mostly because of the gas stations.

13:13.040 --> 13:16.720
I think disruption is more a function of how ripe an industry is to be disrupted

13:16.720 --> 13:20.640
as opposed to the disrupting technology. It wasn't immediately obvious that Google was

13:20.640 --> 13:25.360
going to disrupt the advertising industry, but the advertising industry had basically said,

13:25.360 --> 13:30.640
we're going to triple our costs every 10 years, even despite the fact that our audiences are

13:30.640 --> 13:36.400
shrinking, more expensive for less reach. It stuck out its chin. Grocery stores and department

13:36.400 --> 13:42.240
stores really hadn't changed in about 30 or 40 years in the fists of stone of Amazon came for it.

13:42.240 --> 13:49.120
Ad-supported cable television got worse and worse, but more and more expensive. Netflix came in at

13:49.120 --> 13:55.360
12 bucks a month and disrupted that industry. The question then becomes, what industry is most

13:55.360 --> 14:01.760
ripe for disruption? AI is clearly the technology, but more important than the technology is what

14:01.760 --> 14:07.040
industry has an enormous chin sticking out right now. I'll come back and try and answer that.

14:09.120 --> 14:13.600
Lines, we spent a lot of time in lines. I think that essentially, if you want to build a company

14:13.600 --> 14:18.720
that's worth over $100 billion, you've got to build a time machine. If you just let your kids

14:18.720 --> 14:23.760
watch Netflix and not broadcast television, that kid says it's 12 days a year in commercials.

14:24.560 --> 14:30.640
Amazon has given you six days back at a spending time in department stores and grocery stores.

14:30.640 --> 14:35.600
The majority of companies that get past $100 billion have effectively built time machines.

14:37.600 --> 14:43.120
I love the company clear. I'm obsessed with trying to expedite everything. In terms of time,

14:43.120 --> 14:48.240
you get that way as you get older. Most of these high-end luxury items are pretty much focused on

14:48.240 --> 14:56.960
saving time. Peter Drucker, who is sort of my role model, an economist in the 60s, basically

14:56.960 --> 15:01.440
said that every major business trend can be predicted by demographics. If you were to try

15:01.440 --> 15:05.280
and find a demographic trend that's going to wag the tail, that it's a good thing to get behind,

15:05.280 --> 15:10.560
and I did get behind this in 2010, I started a company doing business intelligence and analytics

15:10.560 --> 15:14.960
for luxury brands because what I saw was that income inequality was about to become income

15:14.960 --> 15:20.400
insanity. History repeats itself. Essentially, you have an economy that starts off as a collective.

15:20.400 --> 15:25.360
Everybody wants to help each other. Wealthy people weaponize government, become more productive,

15:25.360 --> 15:30.560
leverage technology, and slowly but surely figure out a way to lower their taxes and figure out a

15:30.560 --> 15:35.280
way to engage in massive tax avoidance, to create more and more power, and will wring their hands

15:35.280 --> 15:39.600
and be very concerned about what's going on. In the next year, the tax rate goes down.

15:40.480 --> 15:44.560
Eventually, there's a revolution, and it starts all over again. We're at a point

15:44.560 --> 15:49.200
right now where it's literally gone parabolic, and you've seen all this data about the 0.1%.

15:50.320 --> 15:53.760
But if I were to say to people constantly coming to me and say, what industry would you be in,

15:53.760 --> 16:00.400
I'm like, if I were just going to any industry serving the 0.1%, because the amount of disposable

16:00.400 --> 16:05.680
income there, it's like that very basic adage that people used to tell young professionals,

16:05.680 --> 16:10.080
get as close to the biggest pile of money, stand as close as you can to the biggest pile of money,

16:10.080 --> 16:14.880
and everything will work out. And that pile of money is increasingly accreting to fewer and fewer

16:15.520 --> 16:23.040
people. So social clubs, the 1% is now sequestering from everybody else, right? We allow visitors in

16:23.040 --> 16:27.280
based on being super interesting or super hot as tourists. We give them a day pass,

16:27.280 --> 16:32.480
but mostly we've decided we no longer want to hang out with the other 99%, even when we're socializing.

16:35.200 --> 16:38.240
Anyone done one of these private tours at Disney? Disney just announced

16:39.200 --> 16:46.240
pretty terrible earnings, but they were saved by one thing, the parks. What they didn't publish

16:46.240 --> 16:51.440
was the thing driving a ton of incremental spend there is these private VIP tours,

16:52.240 --> 16:56.240
where you pay somewhere between, I think, seven and 900 bucks an hour, a minimum of five hours.

16:56.240 --> 17:01.920
So for about five to seven grand, you and five friends get to cut the line. I did this for the

17:01.920 --> 17:07.040
first time last year. And it's physically uncomfortable when you get to the Avatar ride,

17:07.040 --> 17:13.760
and they could hand out an iPad when you get in the line. And you could watch Avatar before

17:13.760 --> 17:19.440
you actually get on the ride. The wait time is three hours if you only paid 160 bucks.

17:20.160 --> 17:26.320
But if you paid 7,000, you and your kids get to cut the line, it's about three minutes,

17:26.320 --> 17:30.400
and they give you a hand signal in case you want to go on it a second or a third time.

17:31.280 --> 17:36.480
And this is the fastest growing part of the park's business. Think about the profits there,

17:36.480 --> 17:44.800
a very high EQ, really nice young man from Kansas shows you around, takes you to a golf cart

17:44.800 --> 17:50.080
behind the bowels of the three parks, so you can go on the two or three best rides at each of the

17:50.080 --> 18:00.800
three parks. It's getting worse. And most of you have probably seen this on TikTok,

18:00.880 --> 18:06.800
but this is where this is socialism, right? You start off thinking everyone should be equal.

18:06.800 --> 18:12.320
It doesn't work, right? People engage in their own self-interest. That's what capitalism is,

18:12.320 --> 18:16.160
taps into one of the most powerful motivators, and that is our own self-interest.

18:17.040 --> 18:21.200
What we want, most people agree that the most productive, hardest-working people should make

18:21.200 --> 18:27.040
more money. And then it's just gone absolutely insane. People really don't recognize just how

18:27.040 --> 18:32.000
insane it's gotten. By the way, wealthy people usually don't talk about money because they see

18:32.000 --> 18:36.960
this uncouth, which is really nothing but an attempt to keep poor people down by ensuring

18:36.960 --> 18:41.120
they don't know how much money they actually are making and have relative to them. So they've

18:41.120 --> 18:46.560
created this social dogma around talking about money. I think everyone should talk about how

18:46.560 --> 18:51.600
much money they make. I think it's healthy because you're going to find out just how outrageous it

18:52.320 --> 18:57.440
is about how some people at a certain level in your company or in society how much money they're

18:57.440 --> 19:06.640
making. So for every $100 created in the past 10 years, 54 bucks went to the top 1%. That's globally.

19:06.640 --> 19:13.200
It's actually much worse than that in G7 nations and even much worse in the U.S. 70 cents of it

19:13.200 --> 19:19.600
went to the bottom half. So about $100, an incremental value created over the last 10 years,

19:19.600 --> 19:26.560
70 cents of it went to the bottom half. It used to take 26 billionaires equal to bottom half of

19:26.560 --> 19:33.520
America. Now it takes, excuse me, used to take 380 billionaires. Now it takes 26. By the end of next

19:33.520 --> 19:37.280
year, there's probably going to be three people in the United States that are worth more than the

19:37.280 --> 19:45.520
bottom half of America. That's the bad news. The good news is that incremental quality is usually

19:45.520 --> 19:51.200
self-correcting. More bad news is the means of self-correction are usually war, famine, or revolution.

19:54.400 --> 19:58.560
Don't you find it unusual that all of these rich people have their go-bags and their bunkers in

19:58.560 --> 20:05.280
New Zealand or in Sonoma? I find it so nihilistic and disappointing that the wealthiest, most

20:05.280 --> 20:10.880
resource and arguably the most intelligent among us decide to devote their resources to colonizing

20:10.880 --> 20:15.440
other planets or taking us into another universe. As opposed to just trying to break this place

20:15.440 --> 20:30.080
a little bit more fucking habitable. This is the wealthy weaponizing government. These are tax rates.

20:31.920 --> 20:36.000
The greatest innovation in history wasn't the iPhone, wasn't chips, it was the middle class.

20:36.800 --> 20:42.640
And that is we had 7 million men coming back from war and we decided to give them money to buy houses

20:42.640 --> 20:48.640
and give them jobs, $500 billion infrastructure act, and that made them more attractive to potential

20:48.640 --> 20:57.360
mates and we had the baby boom. The tax rate on the top 1% in 1945 was 92% because to sustain

20:57.360 --> 21:02.800
the middle class, the greatest innovation in history took a lot of money. And so we recognized

21:02.800 --> 21:07.440
that if we wanted a really progressive tax structure, we would have to tax people at a higher

21:07.440 --> 21:11.680
rate. And in the spirit of transparency, just to give you a sense of how ridiculous things have

21:11.680 --> 21:18.000
gotten, I buy or I start companies, I got very lucky. I sold one of my companies a few years ago.

21:18.000 --> 21:25.040
The first $10 million to me, the founder, were tax free. I've invested in another company. I invested

21:25.040 --> 21:30.560
two and a half million bucks in another company that just got purchased. The first $25 million to me

21:30.560 --> 21:37.120
because of QSB will be tax free, zero tax rate on the first $10 million when you're an entrepreneur

21:37.760 --> 21:43.120
or when you make a large capital investment in a small company. And people will say, well, okay,

21:43.120 --> 21:49.600
but you're a productive citizen. You wouldn't start companies unless you had these tax breaks.

21:49.600 --> 21:52.880
No entrepreneur knows the tax rates when they start a business.

21:55.120 --> 22:01.200
My effective tax rate for the last decade has been 17%. That's my effect of tax rate,

22:01.200 --> 22:05.760
and I'm very public about that. And there's another myth, and that is that lower and middle

22:05.760 --> 22:09.840
income people are paying all the taxes. Actually, they're not. They pay a lot in consumption and

22:09.840 --> 22:15.680
sales tax, but they actually pay very little federal income tax. The people who get most

22:15.680 --> 22:22.000
screwed by our tax code are what I refer to as the workhorses. And that is they make between

22:22.000 --> 22:28.560
$150,000 and a million a year. And it's all reportable. It's all current income. And they're

22:28.560 --> 22:32.560
usually in order to make that kind of money have to live in an urban center that's usually a blue

22:32.560 --> 22:36.960
state. And they're usually paying an effective tax rate of somewhere between 45% and 50%.

22:37.920 --> 22:42.720
And they make enough money to live well. No one feels sorry for them. But until they have enough

22:42.720 --> 22:48.400
money to start making investments where they register capital gains, they're paying tax rates of 45%

22:48.400 --> 22:54.560
or 50%. Now, if they really start to live large and make a lot of money and can afford to put that

22:54.560 --> 23:00.160
money into investments, then they make the jump to light speed. And their tax rate, once they get

23:00.240 --> 23:06.720
to about the 99th percentile, starts to plummet. So we've effectively decided that if you win a

23:06.720 --> 23:11.760
gold medal, we're going to take the silver and the bronze and give it to you too. Your tax rate

23:11.760 --> 23:18.080
goes parabolic. Once you go over six figures, keeps going higher and higher until about a million.

23:18.640 --> 23:22.720
And then it absolutely plummets once you get into the top 1%.

23:23.120 --> 23:32.960
Luxury is the best business in the world. Wealthiest man in the world

23:33.680 --> 23:39.120
didn't invent a search engine or a social media network. He basically creates artificial scarcity.

23:40.320 --> 23:44.160
He creates desire. Wealthiest man in the world is, of course, Bernard Arnaud.

23:44.720 --> 23:48.080
And these three guys now have wealth greater than the GDP of a bunch of nations.

23:48.560 --> 23:52.160
Private flight, private travel won't bore you with this is up. This is an interesting stat and

23:52.160 --> 23:57.760
that private luxury usually gains some popularity before an economic crash because people become

23:58.480 --> 24:04.400
self-conscious about their wealth. I'm obsessed with succession and this kind of defines sort of

24:04.400 --> 24:10.800
quiet luxury. No logos, just very expensive, beautifully crafted things that aren't very flashy.

24:11.760 --> 24:16.560
Now, you might say, well, where do billionaires come from? The industry that's created the second

24:16.560 --> 24:20.720
most billionaires is actually luxury. Tech has created more.

24:24.240 --> 24:29.520
This is the best business in the world and that is creating artificial scarcity. And artificial

24:29.520 --> 24:35.280
scarcity is essentially the strategy that unfortunately America has adopted. The strongest

24:35.840 --> 24:43.440
brands in the world aren't Apple or Hermes or Nike. They're MIT and Stanford and Harvard.

24:44.160 --> 24:48.320
And every day, me and my colleagues wake up and we ask ourselves one question.

24:49.360 --> 24:55.200
How can I increase my compensation while reducing my accountability? And the way we do that,

24:57.760 --> 25:04.320
the way we do that is we've adopted the ultimate strategy. We target the 0.1% and we adopt this

25:04.320 --> 25:10.480
rejectionist exclusionary luxury positioning. And despite the fact we sit on endowments, again,

25:10.480 --> 25:17.440
the size of some Latin American GDPs, we don't expand freshman seats. So we can take admissions

25:17.440 --> 25:23.600
rates and take them way, way down and turn into a Birkenbag as opposed to public servants.

25:25.120 --> 25:30.320
It makes alumni feel good. The value of your degree goes up when it gets harder to get into

25:30.320 --> 25:34.960
your institution. The moment you have a house, you start taking an interest in the local review

25:34.960 --> 25:40.000
board and basically come up with thoughtful ways to ensure that new housing never gets built.

25:41.200 --> 25:47.680
Meaning that housing costs in the US have accelerated about the same price as a luxury

25:47.680 --> 25:51.840
good. Once I have a tech company and it works, I'm going to weaponize government to make sure

25:51.840 --> 25:58.560
new companies can't get born. Our entire economy has moved to a luxury artificial scarcity economy

25:59.280 --> 26:04.800
where we create artificial scarcity to drive up prices that drive value to the incumbents and the

26:04.800 --> 26:16.000
entrenched. This is how I explain it. For most of history, our species hasn't had access to

26:16.000 --> 26:20.800
sugar, salt, or your fatty foods, so diabetes, right? Our instincts haven't caught up with industrial

26:20.800 --> 26:25.600
production. So if you can create something that feels scarce, if you can convince people that

26:25.600 --> 26:31.520
a Panerai watch is scarce, right, they artificially choke supply. So if I see one, I think I got to

26:31.520 --> 26:36.720
buy one because I want to signal masculinity and strength. I'm dying soon, so I need to signal

26:36.720 --> 26:44.240
this type of success, right? And they do a great job of creating art. This is not a difficult thing

26:44.240 --> 26:51.680
to produce. It's about 1500 bucks of movement, plastic, glass, and leather that they sell for

26:51.680 --> 26:57.920
about 12,000 bucks by creating this illusion of scarcity. When there's a scarcity of food,

26:57.920 --> 27:04.000
a scarcity of mating opportunities, and now a scarcity of luxury items or scarcity of education

27:04.000 --> 27:08.880
at an elite university, you can raise prices faster than inflation and aggregate a great

27:08.880 --> 27:20.080
deal of wealth. And this is the only video I could come up with last night to explain it.

27:20.080 --> 27:37.280
Three times last night, somebody here, that gets a plus.

27:38.080 --> 27:40.800
Three times last night, someone offered me mushroom chocolates.

27:42.640 --> 27:46.240
And I don't know, I don't know if that says something about you or something about me.

27:47.120 --> 27:52.320
And the third time I said yes, and I just went back to my room and I watched this video about 80 times.

27:59.440 --> 28:01.840
It was a pretty nice way to spend the night. I opened the window,

28:02.720 --> 28:11.520
opened the window, kept asking myself, how high am I now? It was really nice. So you're out there and

28:11.520 --> 28:22.640
thank you. It's the ultimate marketing strategy, create artificial scarcity, right?

28:26.000 --> 28:30.880
And luxury has outperformed every other industry, again, all footing back to a demographic shift,

28:30.880 --> 28:36.400
and that is the .1% are aggregating more and more wealth. And you may not feel rich. Every person

28:36.400 --> 28:42.480
in this room is probably in the top 10% in their G7 economy. And if you make more than $40,000,

28:42.480 --> 28:49.680
you're in the top of 1% globally in terms of income. Tremendous growth potential. This status

28:49.680 --> 28:54.960
blew my mind. Hermes now has a larger market capitalization than Nike. Can you believe that?

28:57.040 --> 29:02.320
Because most companies, if you can create artificial scarcity, you literally create a cash

29:02.320 --> 29:07.680
picket. And I've worked with all of these companies that I'm talking about. I'm going to do a ton

29:07.680 --> 29:14.160
of name dropping because I'm deeply insecure and desperate for your affirmation. But essentially,

29:14.160 --> 29:18.800
Hermes, go into an Hermes store and say, yeah, I'll take that back. And they're like, oh, sir,

29:19.760 --> 29:27.200
that's a three-year waiting list. This shit is not hard to make. These bags are not hard to make,

29:27.200 --> 29:31.920
but they have done a genius job of creating a sense of artificial scarcity. So as a result,

29:31.920 --> 29:38.160
if the CFO walks into the COO's office in Hermes and says, I need another literally

29:38.160 --> 29:45.120
billion dollars in revenue over the next three months, the COO can do it. No problem. Just produce

29:45.120 --> 29:51.520
another $15,000 average price point bag. We'll produce another 600,000 bags. There's your billion

29:51.520 --> 29:58.480
dollars, 80 points of gross margin, $800 million in gross margin, $400 million in EBITDA. And the

29:58.480 --> 30:04.240
analysts know that. So they can perfectly predict and calibrate. They make their projections because

30:04.240 --> 30:09.280
if they're about to miss their projections, they just turn on the tap. There's very few companies

30:09.280 --> 30:14.320
that are able to establish that type of scarcity or create a cash tap where all they need to do is

30:14.320 --> 30:23.360
just open or throttle the spigot. So we've gone from luxury to ultra luxury. I love to travel. I

30:23.360 --> 30:28.080
don't travel to cities or countries. I travel to hotels. I find hotels that look great. And that's

30:28.160 --> 30:34.080
where I go on vacation. And you have seen basically the Ritz-Carlton, the Four Seasons,

30:34.080 --> 30:39.200
which used to be sort of the top luxury brands, be bested. They were sort of for the top three or

30:39.200 --> 30:46.320
four percent, but now 0.1 percent brands have come in because that's where a ton of incremental income

30:46.320 --> 30:52.320
has happened. So you're seeing hotels where the average price point, the average price point is

30:52.400 --> 30:59.840
$7,000 or $9,000 a night. And they're full. So you just have the Four Seasons, the Mandarin

30:59.840 --> 31:06.960
Oriental and the Ritz-Carlton. And now you have Cheval and Blanc, Amen, Rosewood, Six Senses have

31:06.960 --> 31:14.240
all come in and said no. The opportunity is in the 0.1 percent. So a weird prediction, but I'm

31:14.240 --> 31:18.720
obsessed with football. You're going to see a massive increase in the value of sports teams

31:19.280 --> 31:25.440
over the next 10 years. One, because as long as we're producing more and more billionaires

31:25.440 --> 31:30.880
who happen to be in the midst of the midlife crisis, you're going to see a massive increase

31:31.600 --> 31:37.040
in the value of these teams. And you're seeing it now. You're seeing an acceleration of the value

31:37.760 --> 31:45.600
of sports teams. One, they actually benefit from some secular trends or structural trends.

31:45.680 --> 31:52.400
The only content that doesn't look to be disrupted by, it's the only content we watch live now that

31:52.400 --> 31:59.280
advertising still works. And it's also taps into people's emotions. You also have an entire region,

31:59.280 --> 32:06.880
the Gulf, that has decided, okay, we need to improve our image. We have to pivot to a non-fossil fuels

32:06.880 --> 32:12.160
based economy. We have 30 to 50 years to do that. We have infinite capital. So how do we do that?

32:12.160 --> 32:16.000
How do we create a perception such that the most talented people in the world

32:16.000 --> 32:21.840
want to come work, live, and be educated here? We have to upgrade our image. There's a smart

32:21.840 --> 32:26.960
people they figured out, unlimited resources. So they used to advertise on Bloomberg and CNN and say,

32:26.960 --> 32:33.360
invest in Malaysia, Qatar, a great place to live. And what they figured out is if they buy a football

32:33.360 --> 32:39.600
team, they get some of that positive brand imagery. And they'll probably break even on a cash flow

32:39.600 --> 32:45.440
basis, maybe lose some money. And then in 10, 20, or 30 years, the asset has increased in terminal

32:45.440 --> 32:51.840
value. So this is the ultimate brand ROI expenditure if you're trying to upgrade the perception

32:52.400 --> 32:57.680
of a country. So we're going to start to see the Gulf nations come into every league, buy leagues,

32:57.680 --> 33:03.840
buy teams, because it's as if they could run a commercial. But then in 10 years, they get three

33:03.840 --> 33:12.240
times the cost of the commercial back. It's also a fantastic way to cross over celebrity,

33:12.240 --> 33:17.600
media, and the value of these things. I would imagine that Ryan Reynolds and Rob are probably

33:17.600 --> 33:21.920
going to make five to 10x on their investment just over 24 months on rexom.

33:22.000 --> 33:30.480
A little awkward being on his boat.

33:34.000 --> 33:38.960
It's the bottom line. Billionaires as they, billionaire Republicans as they realize they're

33:38.960 --> 33:43.840
not going to live forever, start buying football teams and billionaire Democrats by media companies.

33:44.560 --> 33:49.120
This is kind of the ultimate expression of like you haven't wrapped your head around death yet.

33:52.320 --> 33:56.880
I just like to slide.

34:02.880 --> 34:07.200
And I'm here to announce that at some point, if I have another 30 or 40 exits, I'm going to buy

34:07.200 --> 34:13.280
Rangers FC and Glasgow. I'm going to take my boys. I'm going to be really into the community

34:13.280 --> 34:22.480
and they will love me. Okay. So the values of these sports teams is already accelerating.

34:23.280 --> 34:28.240
There's going to be investor groups, SPACs. This is going to be kind of a new accelerating

34:28.240 --> 34:33.040
luxury item. You're going to see all sorts of new investment opportunities. Someone

34:33.040 --> 34:37.520
enterprising will put together a DAO and start buying teams and people like us will have the

34:37.520 --> 34:43.040
opportunity to participate. And then I think you're especially going to see it in football.

34:43.840 --> 34:48.640
Again, I'm biased here, but I think that these, this league or these teams appear to be global

34:48.640 --> 34:53.360
brands or I think they're going to accelerate faster than any other global brands. You're going

34:53.360 --> 35:01.040
to start hearing terms like, you know, Arsenal and Inter Milan that you didn't hear before or

35:01.040 --> 35:06.800
that most people didn't hear before. These brands are going global. This is shocker. I'm really going

35:06.800 --> 35:14.080
on a limb here. I said this a year ago. I have this kind of secret weapon for figuring out if

35:14.080 --> 35:19.680
the technology is enduring. And that is I look at the amount of citations in academic journals.

35:20.560 --> 35:28.000
And typically what you have is in academia, the whole academic research is really, it's a

35:28.000 --> 35:31.280
wonderful thing. It sounds very basic, but it's really a wonderful thing. And that is you put

35:31.280 --> 35:36.080
out, you publish something, you say, wow, I think I'm onto something about AI. And you publish it

35:36.080 --> 35:40.480
and you publish your thesis and your research. And then someone, a colleague from Carnegie

35:40.480 --> 35:44.400
Mellon or Tulane says, this is what you got right. And this is what you got wrong. And I'm going to

35:44.400 --> 35:48.880
refute it. And if they can refute it, we actually celebrate them as long as they add value to it.

35:48.880 --> 35:52.800
And we congratulate them. We still don't start shit posting each other on Twitter. We say,

35:52.800 --> 35:57.840
okay, what you're saying is right. You've made my research better. And we have an enduring build

35:57.840 --> 36:02.640
of intellectual property that ideally then floats into the private sector. And as you can see in

36:02.640 --> 36:08.160
mobile and GPS, that build was slow and steady. And I would argue the mobile and GPS are probably

36:08.160 --> 36:14.880
the most enduring technology of the last 30 years. Now, in contrast, let's look at the academic

36:14.880 --> 36:24.560
research and citations of the metaverse and crypto. Right? Me and my colleagues, oh, the metaverse is

36:24.560 --> 36:33.600
hot. Right? Oh, crypto, it's hot. Right? And then this is what happens. It just dies.

36:36.560 --> 36:44.000
Look at the curve and artificial intelligence. It's very similar to the curve of mobile and GPS.

36:44.960 --> 36:50.800
And I can't find any other technology that has the same citations or the same curve

36:51.360 --> 37:00.480
of this, the most enduring technology other than AI. So every academic journal entry

37:02.160 --> 37:06.400
has been improved upon. We've been thinking and talking and writing about this for a long time

37:06.400 --> 37:12.400
and researching it. And it continues to get better and better and better in this, in my view, is in

37:12.400 --> 37:18.160
fact an enduring technology. Every year, I'm a glass half empty kind of guy. I'm better at predicting

37:18.160 --> 37:23.120
when technologies don't work. I have every year kind of the most ridiculous technology award.

37:23.120 --> 37:29.280
Two years ago, it was the metaverse. Right? 40% of people who put on that headset feel nauseous

37:29.280 --> 37:36.640
within 30 minutes. No one wants to go into an in cell panic room. These things, I think big tech

37:36.640 --> 37:42.720
is a net positive for the world. I do not believe that of meta. And I could not have invented a

37:42.720 --> 37:50.080
better strategy than to convince a young man to spend $1.2 billion a month on his big go

37:50.080 --> 37:54.720
by a wasca dreams that people are going to want to go into a legless universe and hang out with

37:54.720 --> 38:01.360
him and other people. I think we all have an obligation. If you, like me, think the people

38:01.360 --> 38:07.920
who run meta are mendacious fox, I think that you have an obligation to talk up the metaverse.

38:08.640 --> 38:14.320
Because my fear is they wake up from this consensual hallucination and start reducing the spend.

38:15.200 --> 38:16.960
So I think it has real potential.

38:27.520 --> 38:33.360
Five days to one million users, right? The curve on adoption and AI is blowing away everything.

38:33.920 --> 38:42.400
We are in the fear-mongering part of the cycle. I am actually quite optimistic about AI,

38:42.400 --> 38:49.280
which stands out, I think. And by the way, I trust on who I adore and have a lot of respect for,

38:49.280 --> 38:53.840
is worried about this and I purposely wanted to go to his talk yesterday to get insight into why

38:53.840 --> 38:58.800
he is worried about it. But what I see is that every new technology, it is easier to understand

38:58.800 --> 39:04.320
the downsides, right? We knew that automation was going to fire a lot of people on the factory

39:04.320 --> 39:09.120
floor and it did in the short term. But we did not anticipate heated seats or car stereos and

39:09.120 --> 39:13.680
net employment in the automobile industry actually went up. And so, yeah, I think there is going

39:13.680 --> 39:18.000
to be some job destruction. I think there will be some security risks. But the amount of new

39:18.000 --> 39:23.360
businesses and opportunities by feeding your health records or spending patterns into these

39:23.360 --> 39:27.360
LLMs, you are going to come up with all sorts of new businesses and new ideas.

39:31.760 --> 39:37.680
Okay. I am going to skip this. Obviously, we had kind of peak hype cycle.

39:39.200 --> 39:43.520
Everyone is talking about AI, right? It kind of reminds me of 99 when you just said,

39:43.520 --> 39:50.720
Williamsonoma.com and your stock price went up. And everyone is trying to figure out on the dark

39:50.720 --> 39:56.880
side here what industries it really destroys. So the Czech CEO made the mistake of saying that

39:56.880 --> 40:02.560
he felt some pressure from chat GPT in the stock loss, 40% of its value in five minutes in the

40:02.560 --> 40:08.240
aftermarket. So investor relations has really now become a story of spin. The number of journalists

40:08.240 --> 40:13.440
over the last 30 years has been cut in half. The number of corporate PR executives, the number

40:13.440 --> 40:19.920
of comms people at companies has gone up six-fold. So the ratio of bullshit to journalism has gone

40:19.920 --> 40:26.240
the wrong way, 12X. The reason why is that three out of four companies that went public 30 years

40:26.240 --> 40:31.280
ago were profitable. And we would assign a multiple within a fairly narrow range to get the valuation.

40:32.000 --> 40:37.120
Now three and four companies that go public are not profitable, or at least over the last 10 years,

40:37.120 --> 40:42.880
which means the narrative is more important than the numbers. So the core competence of every CEO

40:42.880 --> 40:48.000
is to be a great storyteller and capture people's imagination, pull cheap capital forward such that

40:48.000 --> 40:54.480
he or she can overinvest and run away from the competition. So as a result, the PR and comms

40:54.480 --> 41:00.240
people manicuring Zuckerberg's image at Facebook now outnumber the number of journalists at the

41:00.240 --> 41:07.760
Washington Post. Think about that. There's more people trying to kind of put wallpaper over these

41:07.760 --> 41:13.120
lies that delay an obfuscation that is meta than there are journalists at the Washington Post.

41:13.520 --> 41:20.960
Typically, technology is easy to create a bunch of new winners or they accrete to the existing

41:20.960 --> 41:26.880
players, right? Search, socially commerce went to new players, mobile went to existing players,

41:26.880 --> 41:32.000
you would argue cloud kind of went to existing players. So far it looks like the big bursts

41:32.000 --> 41:35.920
of market capitalization are going to existing players because it requires substantial

41:35.920 --> 41:38.800
infrastructure, specifically massive processing power.

41:39.360 --> 41:47.680
Coming back to travel, I think there's enormous opportunities in travel and AI. I'm going to the

41:47.680 --> 41:53.360
Eurofinals with my 12-year-old and we're playing with AI to try and create the ultimate weekend.

41:53.360 --> 41:59.120
But you can see how this would be a tremendous time savings. Again, going back to time machines

41:59.680 --> 42:07.280
to plan a great weekend. Give me a great weekend with six of my friends, all women in our 30s.

42:07.280 --> 42:11.360
We want to go to Mexico. This is our economic weight class. These are our priorities and it

42:11.360 --> 42:15.520
comes back with an itinerary. And then a series of questions. What else can I answer for you?

42:16.080 --> 42:20.720
Do you want me to make reservations? Confirm now. Do you want me to send emails out to the six

42:20.720 --> 42:25.360
friends? I mean, you can just see this is going to get really exciting, very fast in travel.

42:26.080 --> 42:38.640
Okay. I had my first AI moment at LAX when I was coming in and I went to global entry and I

42:38.640 --> 42:43.360
started putting my passport in and I heard Galloway and I'm a narcissist so I thought,

42:43.360 --> 42:50.560
oh, it's a fan. And it was a woman from TSA saying, you're good. And so they're doing

42:50.560 --> 42:56.000
facial recognition and learning on AI such that you can get right through the airport. I think

42:56.000 --> 43:01.760
that's fantastic. By the way, I'm all for privacy violation as long as we have strong courts and

43:01.760 --> 43:06.560
people to oversee or punish companies when they abuse that data. But the notion that if you give

43:06.560 --> 43:11.360
a flying fuck about privacy is hilarious. As you'll tell everybody exactly what you're doing

43:11.360 --> 43:17.520
everywhere. With a thin layer of AI, if Uber gets hacked, we're going to know if you're having an

43:17.520 --> 43:23.920
affair, your HIV status, and if you terminated a pregnancy. It is going to be, you have given up

43:23.920 --> 43:32.240
all privacy. This is the industry that AI will disrupt. And it's because it's the most disruptable

43:32.240 --> 43:38.800
industry. The way to describe American healthcare is expensive and bad. It's outpaced inflation.

43:39.440 --> 43:46.160
It is now the largest industry in our economy and only 20% of healthcare consumers are happy

43:46.160 --> 43:50.160
with their healthcare. Think about that. It's raised prices faster than inflation for 30 or 40

43:50.160 --> 43:57.440
years, and only one in five consumers are happy with their healthcare. We spend $12,000 per person

43:57.440 --> 44:06.720
on healthcare. I mean, about Australia spends less than five. And yet we die much earlier. Think

44:06.720 --> 44:13.520
about that. Mostly through death of despair, opioid addiction, suicide, right? But think about

44:13.520 --> 44:19.360
just how ridiculous it is and also obesity, but that we have a nation that spends a lot

44:19.360 --> 44:25.040
more than anyone else, and yet we're dying earlier. And again, terrible satisfaction.

44:26.240 --> 44:31.120
So again, it's more about how disruptable an industry is than the technology itself. And I

44:31.120 --> 44:37.520
think you're going to see, if I just was an economic animal, strong certification, some decent

44:38.240 --> 44:42.720
options professionally, and I thought, where is the most wind going to be in my sail?

44:42.720 --> 44:49.120
I would try and position myself somewhere between AI and healthcare, right? Where you feed in your

44:49.120 --> 44:56.080
workouts, your nutrition, here's just my grocery bills. Here's my fitness app. Here's my AmEx receipts.

44:56.720 --> 45:01.760
And here's my blood work. And I want this AI model to start managing my healthcare

45:02.480 --> 45:07.440
and making recommendations and take healthcare from a defensive on your heels disease driven

45:08.400 --> 45:13.600
application to an offensive health driven. And I think there's going to be all sorts of costs.

45:13.600 --> 45:20.000
I don't have health insurance. And people hear that and they go, whoa, no health insurance.

45:20.800 --> 45:25.840
Because health insurance for me and my family for the health insurance I want is $50,000 a year.

45:27.200 --> 45:32.560
And because I have some economic security, I can absorb a big health scare. I could absorb almost

45:32.560 --> 45:38.720
any health scare. And so I decided, all right, about 50% of our healthcare costs are not being

45:38.720 --> 45:44.560
reimbursed. So I'm going to go without health insurance. I did that five years ago, a quarter

45:44.560 --> 45:49.120
of a million dollars will buy a lot of healthcare. So what the healthcare industry has done,

45:49.120 --> 45:52.480
especially the health insurance, the insurance part of the industry, which I think is the most

45:52.480 --> 45:58.880
vulnerable 45% of all insurance costs in healthcare go to profits and administration,

45:58.880 --> 46:04.320
meaning if you spent $100 on health insurance, you're getting $55 back. If you're a younger person,

46:04.320 --> 46:09.840
you don't get $55, you get more like 25 or 35, because you're subsidizing people my age and older.

46:11.200 --> 46:16.560
But we scare you. You're irresponsible. And what if you get really sick?

46:18.160 --> 46:23.840
So again, it's another example of a very elegant transfer of wealth from young people to old people.

46:24.640 --> 46:31.120
Under the same auspices of rejectionism or capital gains tax that rewards money more than sweat.

46:31.760 --> 46:35.920
Who makes money off money? People my age. Who makes money off sweat? People your age.

46:36.800 --> 46:42.560
Second biggest tax deduction in America, mortgage interest. Who owns homes? People my age. Who rents?

46:42.560 --> 46:49.440
People your age. People over the age of 70 are 72% wealthier than they were 40 years ago. People

46:49.440 --> 46:55.760
under the age of 40 in America are 24% less wealthy. Almost everything we do in America

46:55.760 --> 47:02.000
is an elegant transfer of wealth from young people to old people. And we wonder why there's a birth

47:02.000 --> 47:07.600
birth rates are off 20% in the last five years. And everyone's staring at their navels saying,

47:07.600 --> 47:10.480
why young people having kids? It's because they can't afford them.

47:17.280 --> 47:18.160
Want to see that again?

47:21.280 --> 47:28.080
All right. We need a time machine in healthcare. Whoever builds it is going to make billions.

47:28.080 --> 47:32.960
Right now it takes two hours for an in-person visit. A telehealth visit takes 13 to 15 minutes.

47:32.960 --> 47:37.280
This is an enormous on-line. The mother of a child with diabetes, and let's be honest,

47:37.280 --> 47:42.960
it's always the mom, spends five months of her year managing that child's healthcare. Think

47:42.960 --> 47:47.920
about that. If a child with diabetes between the referrals, the applications, the insurance,

47:47.920 --> 47:50.640
you spend five months of your year managing that child's healthcare.

47:53.200 --> 48:00.960
The pandemic did bring an acceleration in remote healthcare. Only about less than 3% of visits

48:01.520 --> 48:08.000
were remote. It went almost to 40% during the pandemic. It's come down, but it's still an enduring

48:08.000 --> 48:15.920
part of our healthcare system remote visits. 38%. It's a huge unlock in mental health.

48:17.200 --> 48:22.240
This is especially dominant or as seen as a real innovation in the mental health sector.

48:23.440 --> 48:26.240
I think it's going to be big in fitness. I'm going to spend a lot of time there.

48:27.200 --> 48:33.360
I'm going to cut to the end. I decided it would be fun to talk about space tourism being on a

48:33.360 --> 48:41.280
Virgin boat. I think this is the most ridiculous business anywhere. Virgin Galactic was nothing

48:41.280 --> 48:46.560
but an elegant transfer of wealth from retail investors who wanted to participate in the

48:46.560 --> 48:51.040
FOMO tech economy such that Richard Branson could keep this ship operating during COVID.

48:52.000 --> 49:01.040
We spent more time just got very awkward in here. We spent more time watching Jeff Bezos go

49:01.040 --> 49:09.440
up in a dildo than talking about climate change in 2022. When Bob from accounting gets

49:09.440 --> 49:15.360
emulated on the launch pad, this entire industry goes away. It is supposed to apply constraint and

49:15.360 --> 49:20.480
demand constraint. There aren't that many people want to spend $400,000 to go three times as high

49:20.480 --> 49:28.480
as you'll go on your way home. Space is really, really difficult. There's a reason they call it

49:28.480 --> 49:35.840
space. It doesn't want you there. It immediately begins destroying material and basically attacking

49:35.840 --> 49:44.880
any organism. It's a terrible business. Space exploration, another ridiculous business,

49:44.960 --> 49:50.720
ridiculous idea. You've got to hand it to them. The view on Mars will take your breath away.

49:51.920 --> 49:54.480
Literally, it will take your breath away. You can't breathe there.

49:56.960 --> 49:59.200
This is the weather here. This is the weather on Mars.

50:04.240 --> 50:10.320
Also, if you're a responsible person, you should absolutely take up base jumping before you go

50:10.320 --> 50:15.760
into space. 550 people have gone into space. 11 have not come back. It has about 10 times the

50:15.760 --> 50:21.280
mortality rate of base jumping. It's a very dangerous business. The part of space that

50:21.280 --> 50:28.160
does make sense is space hauling, specifically space hacks. We need to get more defense and

50:28.160 --> 50:33.120
communication equipment. It's essentially who can get things up reliably and cheaply. I think

50:33.120 --> 50:39.680
space hacks is going to be more valuable than Tesla, mostly because Tesla's value will implode.

50:39.680 --> 50:45.680
It's a car company, not a software or an energy company, but space hacks has figured out a way

50:45.680 --> 50:53.120
to get heavy materials into orbit much more cost-effectively. I'm going to skip through this.

50:54.400 --> 50:59.520
Loneliness. You've heard a lot about this this weekend. I'm working with Surgeon General Vivek

50:59.520 --> 51:08.000
Murti, who is a very impressive and lovely man. Anytime you take one substance and transfer it

51:08.640 --> 51:13.120
or transition it to another, there's externalities. Anytime you take X and turn it into Y for

51:13.120 --> 51:17.840
economic gain, you're going to get externalities. We turn plant-based calories into beef-based

51:17.840 --> 51:23.840
calories. We get methane and deforestation. We take fossil fuels and we turn them into petroleum.

51:23.840 --> 51:30.320
Obviously, we get externalities in the form of carbon. I do not believe that carbon emissions

51:30.320 --> 51:34.960
and climate change are the most serious threat facing humanity. I think there's another

51:34.960 --> 51:39.840
externality that has arisen because of a conversion of one substance to another that is a

51:39.840 --> 51:47.600
bigger threat. That is the conversion from advertising into dollars or specifically from

51:47.600 --> 51:54.400
attention into advertising into dollars. Because what we figured out in the 50s, 60s, and 70s,

51:54.400 --> 51:59.840
we thought it was sex that would keep you glued to your screen. What we have found out is that the

51:59.840 --> 52:06.960
real sex that sells isn't sex, it's rage. As a result, the companies that are now

52:09.680 --> 52:14.240
building the most shareholder value are the ones that basically are in the business of polarizing

52:14.240 --> 52:19.600
and dividing and depressing. Why do I think it's the most dangerous emission? If we all hate each

52:19.600 --> 52:24.800
other, we're never going to figure out a way to come to any sort of agreement or action plan around

52:24.800 --> 52:29.520
the other things that ale us because we don't trust each other. The moment one group takes a

52:29.520 --> 52:35.520
position on something, there's reason for the other group to suspect them and gas like them

52:35.520 --> 52:41.120
or basically not believe it. It doesn't matter what it is. We used to be bipartisan around science,

52:41.920 --> 52:47.760
but I know the algorithms like it when I say mRNA vaccines all to your DNA. We like that,

52:47.760 --> 52:53.360
elevate that content because it pisses people off. We'll get more comments, more engagement,

52:53.360 --> 52:58.880
more enragement, more engagement, more Nissan ads. The result is depression.

53:02.160 --> 53:10.000
One in three teenage girls have contemplated suicide. One in five LGBTQ youth have attempted

53:10.000 --> 53:15.760
suicide. I went back to my old high school, university high school in West Los Angeles a few

53:15.760 --> 53:22.720
weeks ago, 2,000 kids, assuming somewhere between five and 10% identify as LGBTQ. It's 200. That

53:22.720 --> 53:27.280
means 40 kids over the next three years are going to try and kill themselves.

53:28.640 --> 53:32.640
When I was in high school, we had a memorial almost every weekend or every week we come in.

53:32.640 --> 53:38.400
We'd say, oh no, we'd see a picture of somebody and a bunch of flowers and it was from almost always

53:38.400 --> 53:43.760
it was from drunk driving. When I grew up, I lived in LA. There was no public transportation, huge

53:43.760 --> 53:49.120
alcohol abuse, no airbags, mothers against drunk driving really hadn't kicked in and kids would

53:49.120 --> 53:56.000
take to Sunset Avenue totally fucked up and get in an accident with no collapsible steering wheel

53:56.000 --> 54:03.200
shaft or airbags and we had death all the time. Now it's no longer drunkenness or cars, it's depression.

54:08.000 --> 54:14.080
The fear I do have around AI is that I worry that young people are entering into a series

54:14.640 --> 54:20.560
of low risk, low payoff relationships. I'm going to convince myself I'm learning and that I'm

54:20.560 --> 54:25.600
investing and I'm going to go on Coinbase. I'm going to convince myself I'm politically engaged

54:25.600 --> 54:31.520
by going on Twitter. I'm going to convince myself I have friends but I'm not really experiencing

54:31.520 --> 54:37.360
friendship and I think slowly but surely especially young men who have very few mating opportunities

54:37.440 --> 54:44.480
because online dating is kind of consolidated mating where the top 5% of males get 80% of

54:44.480 --> 54:52.400
the opportunities. They're going to engage in a low risk, easy, low barrier of relationships

54:53.120 --> 55:00.640
with sex bots and AI trained girlfriends and I think this ultimately over time makes us depressed

55:01.440 --> 55:05.280
that the reason we're happy, the reason we're joyous is we engage in victory.

55:06.160 --> 55:12.480
We have obstacles that make the destination or the relationship more rewarding. There's a reason

55:12.480 --> 55:20.320
the romantic comedies are 2 hours not 10 minutes. Supposedly if you or there's new research showing

55:20.320 --> 55:27.360
if you smoked and had friends right or didn't smoke and had no friends you would live longer

55:27.360 --> 55:35.040
if you smoked a pack a day and had friends and now 1 in 7 males don't have a single friend.

55:36.720 --> 55:40.560
Now I mean think about that. Think about the amount of joy, think about the

55:40.560 --> 55:46.160
prosperity, just a sense of self-worth, the laughter you've experienced with friends and 1

55:46.160 --> 55:52.160
in 7 males in America doesn't have a single friend. I'm not going to play the clip on her

55:53.040 --> 55:58.000
so I'm worried that slowly but surely we're going to start to replace human touch and what it means

55:58.000 --> 56:05.200
to be a mammal and decide that you know trying to meet people is hard. Having the confidence to

56:05.200 --> 56:10.640
approach someone and express romantic relationship while making them feel safe is a skill that young

56:10.640 --> 56:17.600
men aren't establishing and so they'll turn to AI and slowly but surely they'll sequester themselves

56:18.160 --> 56:21.360
from the rest of the world which I think leads to depression.

56:24.000 --> 56:28.000
There's a woman who's now turned herself into a scalable girlfriend and she expects to make

56:28.000 --> 56:36.240
five million dollars a month charging a buck a minute. I love this quote right it kind of

56:36.240 --> 56:41.920
summarizes it all what is love if it's not grief persevering most of my philosophy I get from Disney

56:42.000 --> 56:52.080
plus okay this is my last thing I'm a bit of a downer so let's try to end with some up note if

56:52.080 --> 56:57.520
you look at our catastrophizing and how down we become about the world and how bad things

56:57.520 --> 57:02.640
become a lot of it is the cadence of the news cycle news used to be 22 minutes once a day

57:03.200 --> 57:08.800
then it turned into 20 hours and now that it's every 20 seconds on your phone with notifications

57:08.800 --> 57:15.200
the only way to keep you on your screen is to catastrophize right things marginally better

57:15.200 --> 57:20.560
today is not a good headline that doesn't work right so we want to create we have to create a

57:20.560 --> 57:25.600
situation for the situation room so we constantly catastrophize and make ourselves feel worse about

57:25.600 --> 57:30.640
the world in each other so if you looked and just took if you just took the perspective back and said

57:30.640 --> 57:35.440
all right last year here's where the biggest headlines any headline you get every 20 seconds

57:35.440 --> 57:40.080
is usually not a good headline but what if you went back five years still kind of bad

57:41.760 --> 57:46.960
can anyone hear that or am I having a stroke it's like a rumbling thanks for that

57:50.560 --> 57:56.400
if you went if you went back 50 years if you went one five ten the news if you had to pick

57:56.400 --> 58:00.320
headlines the news gets progressively better the more perspective you have perspective is a

58:00.320 --> 58:05.280
photographic term and the more you create the angle wider the better the news gets because the

58:05.280 --> 58:09.200
reality is if you're honest with yourself and you look at anything from a long-term perspective

58:09.200 --> 58:14.080
the news just gets hard to hard to deny it's pretty good what would the news be if you had one headline

58:14.080 --> 58:20.800
for the last 50 years probably be unprecedented prosperity led by china in the us or that abject

58:20.800 --> 58:25.600
poverty has been cut by 80 percent if you could only pick one or two headlines you'd have no choice

58:25.600 --> 58:29.200
but probably to make them positive and if you could only have one headline for the last hundred

58:29.200 --> 58:37.520
years what would it be that's a very good one life expectancy in china since the year i was

58:37.520 --> 58:43.520
born has gone from 46 to now 76 and 500 million people have been bought out brought out of poverty

58:43.520 --> 58:48.080
in china over the last 30 years but still i think that probably the headline for the last

58:48.080 --> 58:52.800
hundred years would be that the west turned back fascism which is a great headline so as the cadence

58:52.800 --> 58:58.160
of news has increased our sentiment has gone further and further down and we need some means of

58:58.240 --> 59:03.840
self-correcting around all this negativity okay i'm not going to talk about how great it is to be

59:03.840 --> 59:13.680
an american i think a lot about regrets in time and how fast it's barreling the majority of our

59:13.680 --> 59:20.720
existence as a species we didn't live past 34 for about 99.9 percent of our time as homo sapiens

59:20.720 --> 59:27.280
we lived to be about 30 or 34 we died in childbirth died in war conflict a broken bone or a bad cut

59:27.520 --> 59:34.640
death so our brains literally can't process us past the age of 35 or 40 by the way by the time you

59:34.640 --> 59:41.520
hit 38 you have trouble adapting to the way you look after that every day you look in the mirror

59:41.520 --> 59:48.240
you're like shit because you can't process it because you're not supposed to be here in addition

59:48.960 --> 59:56.160
you can't you can't get your mind around time and ask anyone in this audience over the age of 40

59:56.160 --> 01:00:03.120
time literally begins to fall off a cliff years become seasons and i'm fascinated with what are

01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:06.960
the biggest regrets at the end of your life my colleague adam alters done great work on this

01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:11.920
and i only got another minute or so here and he does he spends a lot of time with people at the

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:17.200
end in palliative care and their regrets basically boil down to three things i wish i'd live the

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:22.160
life i wanted to live not the life that others wanted me to live i wish i'd stayed in touch with

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:26.880
friends and most importantly i wish i'd been less hard on myself i wish i'd forgiven myself

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:32.880
i think about this a lot is i'm barreling towards the end i'm an atheist i think at some point

01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:36.400
i'll look into my kids eyes and know that our relationship is coming to an end and i find

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:41.840
it a source of power but if you're successful you live a lot in the past you call on your

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:46.720
credentials and your experience to try and inform your current actions and if you're like me and you

01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:51.520
suffer from depression and anger you spend the majority of your waking hours in the past

01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:56.080
god i can't believe what a fucking idiot i am i can't believe i did that i can't believe i said

01:00:56.080 --> 01:01:03.680
that you're constantly beating yourself up right can't can't get past this immutable thing called

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:10.320
the past just can't get past it and if you're successful also also like me you're a lot in

01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:15.120
the future you're constantly trading off the short term you're constantly planning i got on this

01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:20.640
boat yesterday because i was supposed to speak at 330 i don't like boats i've never been on one

01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:26.960
before i'm agoraphobic i don't like people much and so when i saw the boat was still docked i thought

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:31.920
i'm going to do this talk and bomb to miami airport get home and i was already planning

01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:36.880
the tottenham spurs brentford game with my sons and what i was going to do with my free time i was

01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:41.760
already in the future planning how to be more productive and chances are if i'd made that

01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:47.040
football game i would have been on my phone virtue signaling that i was with my son checking the

01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:53.600
amount of likes i got thinking about what i was going to do the next day never really there right

01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:59.200
never you know always in the future always in the past never really there i like what sam harris

01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:04.960
says the past is the most immutable thing in the world the future is the most mutable thing

01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:10.640
unfortunately we don't have a lot of we don't have a lot of control over it but this is it this is

01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:15.600
what we this is it this is the only really the only thing we have is the here and the now

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:23.200
and my biggest fear and i think about this a lot is that i'll be at the end and i'll look back and

01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:31.760
i'll go oh my god unbelievable blessings staggering prosperity that i didn't expect people i love and

01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:38.640
love me immensely right but i was never really there for it

01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:48.240
and did my life happen so i leave us with a question

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:54.160
and it's something i ask myself all the time now are you here

01:02:58.960 --> 01:02:59.600
that's all i got

01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:02.660
you
