1. **One Step Samplers in Diffusion Models**: The talk discusses the importance of defining one step samplers for diffusion models, which can significantly reduce latency in interactive applications. The goal is to find ways to sample from diffusion models more efficiently, potentially leading to faster response times.

2. **Semantically Meaningful Latent Space**: A challenge with diffusion models is that their latent spaces do not inherently carry semantic meaning, unlike those in GANs. This makes it difficult to manipulate the latent space for tasks like image editing or manipulation. The talk suggests exploring ways to define a semantically meaningful latent space in diffusion models to enable such manipulations.

3. **Diffusion Models for Discriminative Applications**: The potential use of diffusion models extends beyond generation to representation learning and high-level tasks like image classification versus low-level tasks like semantic segmentation. The talk raises questions about how these models can be adapted for discriminative applications and whether they can be used for uncertainty estimation in downstream tasks.

4. **Joint Discriminator-Generator Models**: While unit architectures are commonly used for diffusion models, the talk posits that it might be beneficial to explore alternative network architectures that could improve sampling efficiency or reduce latency.

5. **Diffusion Models for Different Data Types**: The discussion extends beyond images to consider 3D data (e.g., meshes, voxels, volumetric representations) and other modalities like video or text-graphs, which may require specific diffusion models tailored to their characteristics.

6. **Composition and Controllable Generation**: A key open problem is to enable composition and controllable generation with diffusion models, allowing for the generation of complex scenes composed of multiple objects and fine-grained control in generation.

7. **Applications Benefiting from Diffusion Models**: The talk encourages revisiting applications that have been traditionally addressed by GANs to see if they could be improved using diffusion models due to their unique properties.

8. **Community Engagement and Knowledge Sharing**: The presenter invites the community to follow them on Twitter for updates on new work related to diffusion models. All content, including slides from the talk, will be made available online.

9. **Outreach and Collaboration**: The speaker encourages viewers to share the video with colleagues and collaborators to foster a broader interest in and application of diffusion models across various fields.

The overall message is that diffusion models are a powerful tool in the generative model arsenal, with applications extending far beyond image generation. There are many open problems and research directions that can benefit from the unique strengths of diffusion models, and the community is invited to contribute to this exciting area of research.
