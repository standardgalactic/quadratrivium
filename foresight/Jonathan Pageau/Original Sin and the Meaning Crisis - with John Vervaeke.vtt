00:00.000 --> 00:05.640
Welcome, everyone, to Voices with Raveke.

00:05.640 --> 00:16.240
I'm joined by and with my good friend, Jonathan Pajot, whose work on the symbolic world deeply

00:16.240 --> 00:23.400
resonates with a lot of what I've been doing work on, and as many of you know don't know,

00:23.400 --> 00:29.720
and I find Jonathan brilliantly insightful, and his reflections on the symbolic aspects

00:29.720 --> 00:37.480
of existence and his ability to reshine and refurbish these stories so that they can shine

00:37.480 --> 00:45.720
for us again is often, you know, it sort of catches you, it's deeply impressive.

00:45.720 --> 00:47.600
So thank you, Jonathan, for coming.

00:47.600 --> 00:48.880
Oh, it's my pleasure.

00:48.880 --> 00:53.760
I always enjoy talking with you, you know, ever since I discovered your work and kind

00:53.760 --> 00:58.080
of discovered the language which you're developing also to talk about these subjects.

00:58.080 --> 00:59.680
It's been really helpful to me.

00:59.680 --> 01:06.320
I find myself thinking in the categories that you are bringing forth and especially speaking

01:06.320 --> 01:13.840
to kind of a secular audience or also convincing Christians that the words they use have meaning,

01:13.840 --> 01:18.360
you know, because sometimes we have this kind of internal language and it stops to actually

01:18.360 --> 01:21.920
be meaningful in the world and it just becomes like a kind of magical language.

01:21.920 --> 01:27.800
So I've been using your expressions on attention, the idea of relevant realization, all of these

01:27.840 --> 01:32.280
expressions have been good to help people re-see things in a different frame so that

01:32.280 --> 01:33.280
they understand them.

01:33.280 --> 01:36.680
So I really appreciate our discussions for sure.

01:36.680 --> 01:39.760
Well, thank you for saying that, Jonathan.

01:39.760 --> 01:47.440
I aspire to this being true, that above and beyond trying to, you know, convince or persuade

01:47.440 --> 01:53.760
people about my specific claims, truth claims, theoretical claims, proposals, practical endeavors,

01:53.760 --> 01:54.760
etc.

01:55.000 --> 02:03.800
I aspire that I do afford, you know, a vocabulary and a grammar for people that helps them to

02:03.800 --> 02:07.160
clarify and develop their thinking.

02:07.160 --> 02:11.440
I mean, that's the art, that for me, that's the way in which I try to enact the Socratic

02:11.440 --> 02:15.600
ideal of being the midwife, right, the midwife for other people.

02:15.600 --> 02:18.680
So thank you for saying that, that means a lot to me.

02:18.680 --> 02:23.080
So what I wanted to start off specifically talking about, you released two excellent

02:23.080 --> 02:27.600
videos, and I'll put the links to them in the description of this video.

02:27.600 --> 02:34.320
One was on, I won't get the actual verbatim name, one was on sort of the religious nature

02:34.320 --> 02:39.120
of a lot of the demonstrations that are happening around that were sort of galvanized into existence

02:39.120 --> 02:41.800
by the death of George Floyd.

02:41.800 --> 02:49.040
And then you did a follow-up, they were sort of like part one and part two, one on the

02:49.040 --> 02:52.720
iconoclasm, the destruction of images, the pulling down of statues.

02:52.720 --> 03:00.120
And one of the things you did was you put your finger on a huge important aspect of this

03:00.120 --> 03:08.000
that is being completely ignored in the mainstream media, but I think is of vital importance.

03:08.000 --> 03:14.760
As has happened in the past between you and I, I, very convergent, I was coming to very

03:14.760 --> 03:18.680
similar concerns and reflections.

03:18.680 --> 03:21.880
And I'd said some things early on about how COVID was going to accelerate the meaning

03:21.880 --> 03:27.960
crisis and cause just a mental health tsunami, and you'd see a proliferation of conspiracy

03:27.960 --> 03:36.360
theory thinking, you'd see purity code behavior, human beings are going to respond in a fashion

03:36.360 --> 03:40.640
to this invisible ubiquitous threat that's causing them to isolate.

03:40.640 --> 03:46.720
And as you, I liked your invocation of the symbolic idea of fasting for most of their

03:46.720 --> 03:48.200
connections.

03:48.720 --> 03:52.360
And then I saw all of that.

03:52.360 --> 04:03.000
And then when the protests began, I had, so I had a reaction that made me sort of refuse

04:03.000 --> 04:07.160
myself from committing, commenting on that publicly.

04:07.160 --> 04:11.720
Part of it was a concern that what you said in your first video of just, you know, saying

04:11.720 --> 04:16.360
something that would be premature polarizing, it was difficult to say anything that was

04:16.360 --> 04:20.560
going to be heard with, that had any kind of nuance or reflection to it.

04:20.560 --> 04:24.680
So part of it was just that kind of caution.

04:24.680 --> 04:25.920
But there was a deeper issue for me.

04:25.920 --> 04:31.000
I was very concerned, and I, I talked to my close friend about this, that I would fall

04:31.000 --> 04:36.880
into a kind of self deceptive bias when I tried to talk about any of this.

04:36.880 --> 04:43.240
So give me a moment, please, I don't mean to trespass on your patients, but I wanted,

04:43.240 --> 04:46.320
in order to try and articulate this, and this has helped me upon reflection, I wanted to

04:46.320 --> 04:50.720
invoke Weber's distinction between the manifest and the latent function.

04:50.720 --> 04:58.400
So to give you a classic example, you know, Weber talked about the manifest, the manifest

04:58.400 --> 05:03.400
function of the bureaucracy is to facilitate, you know, information traveling upward and

05:03.400 --> 05:08.120
decision and struggling downward, and that's its manifest function, but it has all kinds

05:08.120 --> 05:09.120
of latent functions.

05:09.120 --> 05:13.360
It has the latent function of allowing people to diffuse responsibility and shift blame

05:13.360 --> 05:14.360
on to others.

05:14.400 --> 05:17.280
And Kafka, of course, brought this into high art.

05:17.280 --> 05:22.720
He showed us how the latent function can, you know, put us into a tragic situation because

05:22.720 --> 05:28.960
our commitment to the manifest function binds us in a tragic fashion to the latent function.

05:28.960 --> 05:33.680
That can be antithetical to it in, in, in kind of a profound way.

05:33.680 --> 05:42.160
And so I was, I was, I'm watching this and, and I, and I'm saying, well, yeah, that, that's

05:42.160 --> 05:47.200
horrible and racism is a horrible thing and what we're seeing happening here.

05:47.200 --> 05:52.760
And there's definitely, I know this because, you know, what's happened since, you know,

05:52.760 --> 05:56.560
9-11 in the Patriot Act, there's been the militarization of the police.

05:56.560 --> 05:59.840
And that has been a very dangerous thing, right?

05:59.840 --> 06:03.200
And I know there's, there's, there's nasty tricks happening.

06:03.200 --> 06:07.880
There's voter suppression happening and all kinds of bad things.

06:07.880 --> 06:14.320
And people are feeling, I think legitimately manipulated and disenfranchised in powerful

06:14.320 --> 06:15.320
ways.

06:15.320 --> 06:20.320
And this, and this is meshing in ways that we're all finding it hard to understand with

06:20.320 --> 06:24.320
a history that has disadvantaged certain groups of people.

06:24.320 --> 06:28.240
And all of this is going on and I'm saying, yes, these are issues that all get addressed.

06:28.240 --> 06:32.760
So my, I don't mean to sound Freudian here, but my sort of conscious explicit awareness

06:32.760 --> 06:34.200
is going, yes, yes, yes.

06:34.200 --> 06:40.040
But I'm having this negative visceral reaction to all of this and I'm trying to go, what's

06:40.040 --> 06:41.040
going on?

06:41.040 --> 06:45.120
And at first I'm, oh, you know, I'm making all these things and I, and I, and I can

06:45.120 --> 06:46.120
feel it.

06:46.120 --> 06:47.120
I'm in the grip of something.

06:47.120 --> 06:52.840
And so I'm talking about this with my friends and I'm reflecting on it and, you know, journaling

06:52.840 --> 06:53.840
about it and everything.

06:53.840 --> 07:00.040
And I'm coming to realize, oh, oh, and Jonathan, you know that I respect your allegiance to

07:00.040 --> 07:01.040
Christianity.

07:01.040 --> 07:02.600
I'm talking about me here.

07:02.600 --> 07:03.600
Okay.

07:03.600 --> 07:11.640
So I said, oh, this reminds, I'm back in my fundamentalist church and I'm the 10 year

07:11.640 --> 07:12.640
old again.

07:12.640 --> 07:17.520
And I'm being traumatized by a puritanical form of Protestantism.

07:17.520 --> 07:22.720
I'm being told that I have an original sin that I, not because of any act that I committed,

07:22.720 --> 07:26.200
but that is just because of how I was born.

07:26.200 --> 07:30.440
And that there's an aspect of this that is unforgivable, no matter what I do.

07:30.440 --> 07:36.080
And everything I try to do to overcome this just makes it that much worse.

07:36.080 --> 07:45.480
And that I need, I need to be absolutely contrite and guilty until some external obscure authority

07:45.480 --> 07:52.320
will finally pronounce me, you know, you know, saved or whatever.

07:52.320 --> 07:57.040
And that, and then what this, what this brings with it, you know, is bonfires.

07:57.040 --> 07:59.360
And I mean, I'm not, I'm not being hyperbolic, Jonathan.

07:59.360 --> 08:03.600
I'm talking about gathering behind the church and putting the rock and roll albums and the

08:03.600 --> 08:06.440
books into a thing and lighting it on fire.

08:06.440 --> 08:07.600
Like can you imagine?

08:07.600 --> 08:08.600
Oh yeah.

08:08.600 --> 08:09.600
I've been through that too.

08:09.600 --> 08:12.240
I grew up with that kind of stuff as well.

08:12.240 --> 08:13.240
Okay.

08:13.240 --> 08:21.440
And so, and, and, and so I'm realizing that the latent functionality of this is so reminiscent

08:21.440 --> 08:31.480
of kind, of a kind of puritanical fundamentalist Protestantism, and again, I was noticing the

08:31.480 --> 08:36.560
same things you're noticing, you know, the acts of contrition, the throwing down of the

08:36.560 --> 08:41.040
stones in the high places, like from the Old Testament, right, where the prophets are always

08:41.040 --> 08:48.720
doing that, right, the kneeling and the confessions and the statement that there's nothing I can

08:48.720 --> 08:51.160
do about it other than feel guilty.

08:51.160 --> 08:56.280
I was noticing how this is, was tremendously religious.

08:56.280 --> 09:02.600
And that, that, as I said to others, that upbringing, like that upbringing traumatized

09:02.600 --> 09:03.600
me.

09:03.600 --> 09:07.000
I mean, I remember, I remember going to the minister and the church with my mother when

09:07.000 --> 09:12.280
I, because I read the Bible regularly, daily, and, and I came across the passage in the

09:12.280 --> 09:14.760
New Testament about the unforgivable sin.

09:14.760 --> 09:15.760
Oh yeah.

09:15.800 --> 09:22.040
Oh, and this just, I fell into, I mean, Cartesian skepticism was nothing compared to the well

09:22.040 --> 09:26.480
I fell into about, well, how do I know what it is?

09:26.480 --> 09:29.280
And how do, and how, like, did I just do it?

09:29.280 --> 09:31.040
And if it's unforgivable, I'm now doomed.

09:31.040 --> 09:32.840
I'm doomed, right?

09:32.840 --> 09:37.720
And that feeling of being doomed and trapped and, and, and, you know, and I went to him

09:37.720 --> 09:42.080
and I want, what I wanted was a clear definition of what it was.

09:42.800 --> 09:49.040
And, and, and I got, I just got, you know, the usual, you need to have faith and, and

09:49.040 --> 09:50.040
it was very unhealthy.

09:50.040 --> 09:56.560
And so I, and so I was realizing, oh, John, you better keep your mouth closed about, because

09:56.560 --> 10:01.040
even if you want to speak about this, this is just going to come flowing through you

10:01.040 --> 10:06.720
because, and it's, and you're going to, it's a, because you have an incredible bias.

10:06.720 --> 10:11.640
It's very hard for you to see this in a positive light, even though sort of intellectually

10:11.680 --> 10:15.600
you can understand these important things that we've already mentioned, you know, the

10:15.600 --> 10:22.520
rate, the, the, the racist history, you know, the, the, the, the subversive disenfranchisement

10:22.520 --> 10:27.560
of people, right, the militarization of the police, all of these things are real and they

10:27.560 --> 10:28.560
need to be addressed.

10:28.560 --> 10:34.360
But, but I realized if I try to say anything about this, my chances of speaking in a way

10:34.360 --> 10:37.360
that I think is clear, we're like going to be seriously undermined.

10:37.360 --> 10:40.960
So I just sort of held back, but then I saw your videos.

10:41.440 --> 10:45.680
And I thought, well, maybe I, maybe with Jonathan's help, I can talk about this.

10:46.600 --> 10:48.880
Sorry, I don't intend this to be a therapy session.

10:48.880 --> 10:50.000
That's not what's going on here.

10:51.560 --> 10:55.760
I want to be really, I want to be really open with you about where I'm coming from.

10:56.120 --> 11:03.720
And I think your video actually points out that this tension, well, let me, I might be

11:03.720 --> 11:08.560
too bold. It suggested to me that this tension that I'm finding in myself is not exclusive

11:08.560 --> 11:14.520
to me, that I, I sensed in you, not to the degree I'm talking about, but also a tension

11:14.520 --> 11:20.080
between, you know, what this might be sort of at a manifest level, and then this unacknowledged

11:20.080 --> 11:25.320
latent function of religiousness, and then you have some criticisms, at least implicit

11:25.320 --> 11:30.960
of this, you had towards the end, you, you warned of danger in the, in the first video,

11:30.960 --> 11:36.680
because the, the, the religion that does not know that it's a religion is not oriented

11:36.680 --> 11:41.200
towards the ultimate. And so there's like a, like a critique coming like via, like, or

11:41.200 --> 11:45.640
similar to what Tillich would meant. You're, it's, it's ultimately, it's an idolatrous for

11:45.640 --> 11:50.880
all of its bringing down of images. It's ultimately an idolatrous religion. And then I was thinking

11:50.880 --> 11:58.520
about this, I was thinking about how, you know, that politics is, is, has in many ways taken

11:58.520 --> 12:04.400
over the domain of religion. I don't think well, it's drenched the 20th century in blood.

12:05.240 --> 12:11.040
But I know that, well, there's sort of two, because religions are supposed to have, like

12:11.040 --> 12:15.000
you said, there's supposed to be moments of communitas and transformation. And I'm trying

12:15.000 --> 12:18.560
to think, well, what are, what are the only rituals left to politics? Well, there seem

12:18.560 --> 12:22.920
to be two. And I was noted how they seem to split between the right and the left. There's

12:22.920 --> 12:28.840
the demonstration of the protest or the rally. And the right likes the rally and the left

12:28.840 --> 12:33.600
likes the demonstration protest. And then I'm thinking, and both of these, we have good

12:33.600 --> 12:38.200
historical evidence, don't bring about the new man, the new person, the transformation

12:38.200 --> 12:42.760
of human beings. And, you know, and all of the revolutions left then, right, the French

12:42.760 --> 12:47.640
Revolution, et cetera, onward, show that it doesn't bring about that, although there

12:47.640 --> 12:52.720
is often religious goal within the French Revolution, and, you know, they worshiping

12:52.720 --> 12:57.280
the goddess of reason and all that stuff, right? It doesn't actually bring about the

12:57.280 --> 13:07.400
promised transformation that it is groping towards. And so I was thinking that, is it

13:07.400 --> 13:16.200
possible to talk about this sort of in terms that are kind of metapolitical about the latent

13:16.200 --> 13:22.600
functionality of the religion, and at that level, legitimately criticize it without thereby

13:22.720 --> 13:28.840
implying that we think, well, I'll speak on my behalf, not yours, without thereby implying

13:28.840 --> 13:35.040
that I think that we shouldn't do something about militarization of the police, the subversive

13:35.040 --> 13:39.920
suppression of voting and disenfranchisement of people, and then how that has often allied

13:39.920 --> 13:46.320
itself with historical factors that are ongoing of racism, et cetera. That's what I'm proposing

13:46.320 --> 13:51.520
to. Is it possible? And I'd like to try and explore that with you. But that's sort of

13:51.560 --> 13:52.600
the frame I want to set up.

13:52.880 --> 13:58.920
Yeah, I think for sure there's, I think there are a lot of things to deal with, and what you said, a

13:58.920 --> 14:03.920
lot of things to kind of unpack at different levels. I think that maybe we can kind of separate

14:03.920 --> 14:09.440
them in the in different parts so that we don't get completely jumbled. One is to look at the

14:09.440 --> 14:18.800
possible reinterpretation of your experience, I'd say, or the notion of the original sin, then

14:18.840 --> 14:24.720
the idea of Adam or the fall of Adam, what that can mean, and how we can reinterpret that in a

14:24.720 --> 14:31.280
manner which is more useful than your traumatized youth. And I understand because I went through all

14:31.280 --> 14:37.440
the stuff you dealt with, I went through the same. And even the description of like the idea of

14:37.440 --> 14:41.600
blaspheming the Holy Spirit and everybody wondering, like, did I blaspheme the Holy Spirit? You

14:41.600 --> 14:48.760
know, all of that, I understand. But I think there are ways to reappropriate the stories, those

14:48.760 --> 14:53.440
stories. And I think we appropriate is I also believe one of the reasons why I went towards

14:53.440 --> 14:59.840
orthodoxy is because they have a different vision of the fall of Adam, one which I think it has a

14:59.840 --> 15:07.000
healthier balance. So that's one. And then the other is then looking also at the way in which these

15:07.000 --> 15:17.760
protests or COVID and the protests together kind of just exploded into a kind of weird catharsis. And

15:17.800 --> 15:24.760
what that means and what it's kind of looking towards. And so sadly, the third part, which would

15:24.760 --> 15:29.880
be like how to get out of this kind of this bind that we're in is the one which I don't know.

15:30.000 --> 15:34.600
Like I really, a lot of people ask me, so what should we do? And I'm looking around. And I think I

15:34.600 --> 15:39.440
don't know what to do, except I don't know what to do socially. Like I think I know what to do

15:39.440 --> 15:44.960
personally. But I don't think I know what the societal solution is. So maybe that one will be

15:44.960 --> 15:48.760
harder. Well, but I do want to talk about that because I've been talking about that with other

15:48.760 --> 15:56.280
people as well. So, but I'm happy with your proposal. But like I said, I'd like to put it, like

15:56.280 --> 16:07.120
I said, into the way in which what's happening, it has, you know, at the level of the latent

16:07.120 --> 16:11.640
functions, there's, well, you said it, I want to use your words, there's something dangerous

16:11.680 --> 16:17.640
happening in this as well. And I want to explicate and draw that out. I'm happy to hear your

16:17.640 --> 16:22.680
revisions. And so I don't know what to call it. Let's say revisioning rather than revision. Yeah,

16:22.720 --> 16:29.720
of these, of these stories. And then, but if you could put that into dialogue with, because, okay,

16:29.720 --> 16:34.240
let me, let me instead of making a statement, let me make, ask a question that's kind of a

16:34.240 --> 16:46.800
request. I see in, you know, I see an analog to a strong analog in this movement to that version

16:46.800 --> 16:51.040
of original sin that I was brought up with. And let's remember that the word Protestant means

16:51.040 --> 16:56.920
those who protest. I mean, right there. And I was brought up in a church where, you know, protesting

16:56.920 --> 17:03.040
and constantly declaring what was evil, and what should be burnt or, you know, and that that was

17:03.240 --> 17:12.280
that was daily, the kind of practice. So do you think that I'm incorrect in saying that the version

17:12.280 --> 17:16.880
of original sin, whether or not it's the right version, I'm going to give you space to talk about

17:16.880 --> 17:23.240
that. But do you think that that that, you know, maybe overly Augustinian version of original

17:23.240 --> 17:28.920
sin is what's at play in this movement right now? Am I incorrect about that?

17:28.920 --> 17:33.720
No, I think you're definitely right. I think you're definitely right. One of the, and I think

17:33.720 --> 17:39.680
it's something that we've seen before, in the sense that maybe an inverted version of what we've

17:39.680 --> 17:46.840
seen before in terms of like racialized vision of the world in the past, which is that we've taken

17:46.840 --> 17:54.080
the notion of original sin, and we've brought it down into biology, which is the scariest thing

17:54.120 --> 18:00.120
that can happen because it actually is inevitable. Like it actually does become inevitable because

18:00.120 --> 18:05.960
it's related. It's linked in a, not in a really scientific way at all, but in a mythological

18:05.960 --> 18:13.640
way, it's still brought into a term which is using language of kind of biological identity or

18:13.680 --> 18:21.480
categories, which are material categories. And so the idea of this racialized guilt, or, you know,

18:21.480 --> 18:29.120
was there in kind of 17th century racism, like kind of neo Darwinism, kind of social Darwinist

18:29.120 --> 18:34.640
racism, this idea that, that certain races were inferior by their own biology and therefore were

18:34.640 --> 18:41.000
made to be slaves or were made to be the lower. And now we're seeing a kind of weird reversal of

18:41.000 --> 18:49.040
that, where we're saying to be a certain race is in itself to be the oppressor, like to be, to be

18:49.080 --> 18:56.960
white, is to be guilty of the, the sin of the revolutionary thinking. Like, it's kind of like,

18:57.000 --> 19:04.720
it's, it's not completely original sin. It's, it's like the end of the revolutionary trend in, in

19:04.720 --> 19:08.760
thinking, right, the French revolution, the Marxist revolutions. And now we've come to kind of the

19:08.760 --> 19:15.240
end of it, where we're actually bringing it into almost a biological reality, where the guilt of the

19:15.240 --> 19:22.200
oppressor is a racial guilt. And it's, and that's, that's, so that, so like you said, it does relate

19:22.200 --> 19:28.280
to original sin, because it means that as someone who has that identity, whether it's actually

19:28.280 --> 19:32.640
legitimate, scientifically or not, it doesn't matter, they're still framed in those categories. As

19:32.640 --> 19:39.360
someone who has that identity, I have no way out. Like I have no way out, except for two things,

19:39.360 --> 19:47.640
which are people are doing, which is to self-flagellate and to scapegoat. That is to put myself

19:47.640 --> 19:53.560
on the, to put myself on the side of find someone guiltier than me and yell at him and tell him that

19:53.560 --> 19:58.760
he has to be canceled and he has to be excluded from society. The only, the only two solutions.

19:58.800 --> 20:05.240
Yeah. And that, like I said, I went through periods where the church I was in would be

20:05.240 --> 20:13.000
driven to bits by exactly that process repeatedly in cycles again and again and again. And when I

20:13.000 --> 20:19.280
sort of, when I sort of woke up to that, I was like, Whoa, this is like, like, when I started

20:19.280 --> 20:24.080
reading some literature and I realized that the literature like showed me what human beings

20:24.080 --> 20:27.560
could be other than this, that was like, so.

20:28.200 --> 20:33.600
But you're right. In the Protestant sense, like if you think of Protestant sex and you notice both

20:33.600 --> 20:41.120
the Puritanist kind of self-flagellation of complete depravity, and then the systematic notion

20:41.160 --> 20:47.120
that all of a sudden, the group I'm in is not pure enough. They're not close enough to the truth. They're

20:47.120 --> 20:53.200
not, and then removing myself with a little, a smaller group, and then condemning those on the

20:53.200 --> 20:59.280
outside as being, as it's like an acceleration. It's always been there. It's there in every, every

20:59.360 --> 21:03.520
structure. Like we can talk about that, but there's an acceleration of it in the kind of

21:03.520 --> 21:09.040
fragmentation of Protestantism. And we see it in intersectionality to an extent which becomes

21:09.040 --> 21:14.240
completely absurd where, you know, at some point it's so obscure that most like regular people don't

21:14.240 --> 21:19.680
even know what you're talking about when trans exclusive this and then trans inclusive. And we

21:19.680 --> 21:23.760
don't, most people are like, I don't understand. And then it's, there's smaller and smaller

21:23.760 --> 21:28.640
identities which are excommunicating other identities and you don't know what's going on.

21:28.720 --> 21:34.960
Yeah. So I mean, that, to my mind, that is the meaning crisis on steroids or methamphetamine or

21:34.960 --> 21:43.040
something. So what, and I think given the deeply deleterious effects which we're seeing, you and

21:43.040 --> 21:47.280
I were talking just before we hit the record about, you know, we're seeing, you know,

21:48.400 --> 21:53.280
you know, people are like, they're people that we're normally sort of very sane, like in our

21:53.280 --> 21:57.840
personal relationships are moving more towards the fringe and they're filled with anxiety and

21:57.840 --> 22:02.080
they're describing their experiences surreal. I think, you know, the deleterious facts of the

22:02.080 --> 22:09.360
meeting crisis are being exacerbated by COVID and then perhaps by certain latent aspects of this.

22:10.000 --> 22:17.680
But I wanted to give you the opportunity to make good on your promise that there's an alternative

22:17.680 --> 22:23.760
way, there's an alternative way. And I mean, I'm interested in this both philosophically

22:24.400 --> 22:29.840
and personally. I typically try not to get too personal in these conversations, but this one

22:29.840 --> 22:33.760
has to be different for the reasons I've already articulated. And I'm putting my trust in you

22:33.760 --> 22:41.200
about this. So that there's an alternative way of conceiving of the myth of original sin. And you

22:41.200 --> 22:46.480
know, I use that word in not in a pejorative fashion. But and so what do you, what is that

22:46.480 --> 22:52.880
alternative understanding to your mind? So the way to understand it is to clearly differentiate

22:52.880 --> 23:00.160
between sin and death. They're related, but they're they're different. And so in scripture,

23:00.160 --> 23:06.720
it says the wages of sin is death, right? And there's an idea that even in the in the scripture,

23:06.720 --> 23:12.400
it never says that we inherit the sin of Adam, it says that that we, because of Adam's sin, we are,

23:12.960 --> 23:18.400
we are in death, like we are in the, in the, in the, in, we are living in a world of death.

23:18.400 --> 23:25.600
And that's really the best way to, to understand it, which is that sin causes death. So you,

23:25.600 --> 23:32.800
you have a purpose, you miss the mark. And that's, that's what death is. And so there's a,

23:32.800 --> 23:38.080
there's a brokenness that you break the system breaks down as you miss the mark. And this is

23:38.080 --> 23:43.680
happens at every level of reality, whether it's in your own life or in society or, or entirety of

23:43.680 --> 23:50.800
the world. When, when something misses the mark, then there's a breakdown, which happens. Now we,

23:50.800 --> 23:59.280
we inherit the breakdown of that, which is before us, right? We inherit death. So we are born in

23:59.280 --> 24:04.320
families that have missed the mark. We are born of parents that have missed the mark. We are born

24:04.320 --> 24:10.800
of systems that have missed the mark. And so because of that, we, we live in a world which

24:10.800 --> 24:16.560
has an aspect of it, which is broken. We still have the aspiration of hitting the mark. And that's,

24:16.560 --> 24:22.080
that's what kind of guides us and makes us want to live, but we have to live with the consequences

24:22.080 --> 24:30.560
of that, of that, of that miss. And the difficulty is that when you're in a world of death, that is,

24:30.560 --> 24:36.640
when you inherit the consequence of sin, so when your parents miss the mark, and they will, and we

24:36.640 --> 24:43.760
know they do, you inherit that. And it makes it more difficult for you to hit the mark because you

24:43.760 --> 24:50.640
have all the baggage which comes and you have inherited the, the, the patterns of being that

24:50.640 --> 24:56.160
will make that worse, right? Which will, which will increase the brokenness, which will tend to

24:56.160 --> 25:02.640
fragment. Okay. And so that's the manner in which we need to understand original sin. That's what

25:02.640 --> 25:11.120
it is. It's the inheritance of brokenness. So, so that, and I hope, I hope you take this as a helpful

25:11.120 --> 25:20.000
thing. That to me reminds me of, you know, certain interpretations of the Buddhist notion of karma,

25:20.000 --> 25:27.360
that there are these patterns at work, and, and we, and we inherit them, and they affect our

25:27.360 --> 25:33.440
behavior, and they cause suffering. And the way I sort of understood this, at least psychologically

25:33.440 --> 25:40.720
and existentially is, as you said, you know, we, we pick up from others, our parents, our friends,

25:40.720 --> 25:45.760
and our culture, we pick up, and that, you know, here's where historical racism does matter, right?

25:45.760 --> 25:53.520
We pick up patterns that are shaping us and moving us in ways that are detrimental to our

25:53.600 --> 26:00.160
aspirations. Is that, is that a fair? Yeah, exactly. Yeah. But the idea is, the idea is,

26:00.160 --> 26:07.280
of course, the very desire, the very aspiration that is the very possibility we have of conceiving

26:07.280 --> 26:14.640
the good, and of seeing the point that we're aiming at, right, of, of seeing it in our view and,

26:14.640 --> 26:24.720
and moving towards it, right, is, is the very, how can I say this, is the reminder that we are not,

26:24.720 --> 26:30.480
that we don't fit in this broken world, that we are, that we are, we find dissatisfaction in the

26:30.480 --> 26:36.240
brokenness. And so that's what causes our suffering. But it's also what, what can ultimately cause our

26:36.240 --> 26:41.760
hope, because we see, we can see that we're not made, like there's something in us which

26:41.840 --> 26:47.200
wants more than this brokenness and this, this world of death. There's something in us which is,

26:47.200 --> 26:53.520
which can see that which we can aim towards, and which is the good, of course. And so that is really

26:53.520 --> 27:01.920
the, and so what, let's say what Christianity shows us, and like what Christ shows us, is that

27:02.720 --> 27:12.720
the manner to reach the, the manner to reach the, the, the aim in the brokenness is to a certain

27:12.720 --> 27:20.320
extent embrace death. And that's really the, that's the hardest thing is to embrace death consciously,

27:20.320 --> 27:25.760
embrace the, the brokenness consciously. And therefore we're, we don't become slaves of that

27:25.760 --> 27:30.800
brokenness, right, is to see your sins, to see the place where you miss the mark, instead of just

27:30.800 --> 27:35.040
blaming your parents, because that's what you will want to do, right? You want to blame your parents,

27:35.040 --> 27:40.000
you want to blame the system, and you're right to, because the system is broken. Your parents are

27:40.000 --> 27:45.440
broken. Everything, there's an aspect of everything that's given to you, which is broken, not fully,

27:45.440 --> 27:50.640
but there is an aspect of it, which is broken. And the solution is to, is to actually rather see

27:50.640 --> 27:58.720
your own death, the places in you that you're, that you're dead and recapture the, the vision,

27:58.720 --> 28:04.880
right, recapture the, the aim. So this, this brings me to a central question that I have

28:04.880 --> 28:09.360
about this. Thank you for that. I think that was very helpful. So let's shift the discussion

28:09.360 --> 28:15.760
onto mortality then. And the interesting thing, of course, and you're aware of this, I know,

28:15.760 --> 28:19.920
in the Greek world is mortality has a, and Heidegger developed this a lot, it has a much more

28:19.920 --> 28:24.720
encompassing notion to it. And then that'll help lead me to my question to you. You know, because

28:24.720 --> 28:30.320
one of the great sins, and I think this is the right word in the Greek world is hubris, right,

28:30.320 --> 28:40.000
which is to, in some sense, forget your mortality, right, and to think that you can, that, that you

28:40.000 --> 28:43.840
can be a God. And, you know, and this is captured in great literature, you know, Conrad's Heart of

28:43.840 --> 28:49.280
Darkness, which of course is now a contentious work, but nevertheless, Kurtz's big sin is hubris,

28:49.280 --> 28:55.040
right? He forgets. And Marlowe's, Marlowe's heroism is he commits himself to his humanity,

28:55.040 --> 29:00.480
that he will preserve his mortality. And I've been talking to my son about this, because,

29:01.120 --> 29:08.560
you know, he lives with me now, partially because of COVID. And, you know, I've been exposing him to

29:08.560 --> 29:12.000
certain ideas, and he's going, but, you know, but I want certainty. And I'm saying, well,

29:12.720 --> 29:18.880
you, yeah, but you can't, part of what being, you know, be embracing your mortality is to

29:18.880 --> 29:24.320
realize that no matter how good your idea might be, you're ultimately a fallible human being,

29:24.320 --> 29:30.400
you're finite. And he was like, but I don't like this. And I said, but your mortality isn't just,

29:31.280 --> 29:36.240
right? And you'll see how this connects to what you said in a second. Your mortality isn't the fact,

29:36.240 --> 29:41.760
you know, like in Tolstoy's Ivan Illich. Ivan Illich knew he was going to die, right? It's not,

29:41.760 --> 29:47.200
it's not that. Your mortality is that, like you said, in some fundamental way, you know, we are

29:47.200 --> 29:54.240
finite, we are broken, we are not gods. So, and I'm seeing this in my discussion with him, how do

29:54.240 --> 30:00.000
you, how do you, because I'm trying to work this with him as a father, getting people to embrace

30:00.000 --> 30:06.640
their mortality is good, because it prevents inflation, it prevents hubris, it prevents, I

30:06.640 --> 30:13.120
suppose it would prevent blasphemy too, from a Christian perspective. And as you said, it helps

30:13.120 --> 30:20.480
people to not, not to fall into the error of, by criticizing others, I implicitly remove myself

30:20.480 --> 30:29.760
from that criticism, right? I see all of that. How do we do that without the, without traumatizing them?

30:30.080 --> 30:38.800
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, that was a bit of a garden path. No, no, I, I think there, I think there has

30:38.800 --> 30:44.560
to be, look, I'm sorry that I'm going to say this, but I think that trauma is part of the

30:44.560 --> 30:50.080
experience, like I think that death is, we don't want to be cruel, but we don't want to be cruel,

30:50.080 --> 30:56.080
is what I'm saying. No, no, right. No, I understand, but death is, death is, is traumatic, like there

30:56.160 --> 31:03.760
is a trauma in death. And so we need, like the, the church fathers and the, the ascetics,

31:03.760 --> 31:08.320
they always say two things, they say, remember God and remember death. Like those are the two

31:08.320 --> 31:12.160
things you need to remember. I always kind of joke around and say, you know, that's the, the

31:12.160 --> 31:17.920
Christian version of, of like mindfulness, you know, it's like remember God, remember death, right?

31:17.920 --> 31:24.640
And so the idea is that if you, if you are, if you kind of remain in your death,

31:25.360 --> 31:30.240
that like you said, you avoid all the problems that you talked about. And the, the strange paradox

31:30.800 --> 31:34.800
in Christianity is that by doing that, you actually do become God.

31:36.080 --> 31:41.360
Yes. Like you, you, you actually do become deified ultimately if you do those two things, right?

31:42.400 --> 31:46.880
But, but it's a non-inflationary. Exactly. And that's the kind of the paradox of,

31:46.880 --> 31:53.760
it's the, the paradox of, of, of creation and the paradox of, of the Garden of Eden, which is that

31:55.600 --> 32:00.560
if Adam had submitted to the will of God and not eaten of the fruit of the tree,

32:01.360 --> 32:06.320
then God would have given him the fruit of the tree. That's the, that's the tradition, right?

32:06.320 --> 32:11.280
That's what many saints have said. And not only that, but that, that would have been his access

32:11.280 --> 32:15.120
to the tree of life, which would have been perfect communion with the divine. And so

32:16.000 --> 32:20.240
it is in humility that we actually reach the highest.

32:20.240 --> 32:23.840
Yes. It's interesting. I just read this morning, when I was doing my lecture,

32:23.840 --> 32:29.040
Divina, a Rilke's passage where he talks about, we throw a ball into the infinite,

32:29.040 --> 32:34.320
and then it returns to us differently. It returns to us heavier. And it's only in that,

32:34.320 --> 32:38.480
in, in, in having done that, that we actually get to feel the true weight of things.

32:39.440 --> 32:42.960
And it sounds like you're saying something very analogous to that.

32:43.840 --> 32:51.760
So how do we avoid the trauma? All I can say is the idea is obviously to place the trauma

32:51.760 --> 32:58.240
ultimately to place it in Christ. Like the ultimate trauma, right, is, is communion. Like

32:58.240 --> 33:04.080
that's the ultimate trauma. If you really take communion seriously, you are engaging in a

33:04.080 --> 33:12.000
traumatic experience. You are eating the flesh and blood of the God man. Like you are, you are

33:12.000 --> 33:16.320
at the foot of horror. Like, you know, you talk about horror a lot in your, in your, in your,

33:18.160 --> 33:22.720
in your lectures. And I, one of the things I do want to bring up to you is that that is why

33:22.720 --> 33:27.920
communion, one of the aspects of communion is to bring you into that horror in a manner which

33:27.920 --> 33:32.880
will, which will save you and not destroy you, right? In a manner in which you can integrate it

33:32.880 --> 33:39.840
in, that it's both a participation in horror and a communion of love at the same time in a

33:39.840 --> 33:45.440
paradoxal way. Yeah. I mean, well, maybe we can talk about this at some point. I mean, I do think

33:45.440 --> 33:52.800
the other sacred brings in simultaneously the symbol on, right? The horrific, the horrifying

33:52.800 --> 33:59.520
function and the homing function in a profound way. And that, that goes back to, so, I mean,

34:00.480 --> 34:06.480
there's two things I want to say. One is like, I'm trying to, but there's a, there's a notion of

34:06.480 --> 34:12.480
mortality and isn't it in the symbolism of carrying your cross that's analogous to the

34:12.480 --> 34:19.840
Buddhist notion that mortality isn't just death, but that the idea that moment by moment, I'm dying.

34:19.840 --> 34:25.280
There's, there's little deaths all the time. And that if I try to avoid that, if I try to

34:26.320 --> 34:32.320
get some kind of permanent hold on things, I'm, I'm, I'm just going to, I'm going to cut myself

34:32.400 --> 34:38.240
on that. And then I'm going to cut other people. It's, again, is that, is that a, is that a

34:38.240 --> 34:42.960
correct analogy? Yeah, of course. Yeah. Like if you look at, if you look at the prayer of Jesus,

34:42.960 --> 34:47.920
the, the basic mystical prayer of the church, it has two, it has two parts, right? It says,

34:49.040 --> 34:55.120
it has an invocation. It says, Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me as center. And so

34:55.120 --> 34:59.680
it's like, there's this invocation and this remembrance of my own brokenness, remembrance

34:59.680 --> 35:05.680
of my own incapacity. And so those two movements simultaneously, they're the ones that will,

35:07.440 --> 35:13.840
and it's, and it's, it's also, and because I think one of the problems of the, of the trauma

35:13.840 --> 35:20.320
of the Protestant is to a certain extent, the idea that it's weird, like the idea that you

35:20.320 --> 35:27.120
should be pure, right? That you should be, but you can't. And so it's like, what, then what,

35:27.120 --> 35:34.560
what do you do, right? You just remain in this strange broken, broken self. But if you rather

35:34.560 --> 35:42.160
see it as this, this necessary part of being a human person and moving towards the good, then

35:42.160 --> 35:48.640
it, then it's not as traumatic because you, you will then see that even the saints lived in,

35:49.200 --> 35:53.920
you know, in the most difficult temptations that the saints were struggling with their passions,

35:54.000 --> 36:01.120
you know, and those who reached the highest had the same frustrations you did. Like they, no one

36:01.120 --> 36:06.000
pretends to be, if you, there isn't like the holier, the person that's holier than now. And

36:06.000 --> 36:11.200
that kind of just, if you read the lives of the saints, you see the story of broken people who

36:11.200 --> 36:16.480
their whole life struggle with thoughts and with temptations, you know, and are delivered by God.

36:16.480 --> 36:21.280
But it's like, okay, if they struggled, so for 30 years, you know, you read, you read crazy stories

36:21.280 --> 36:26.400
of the saints where it's like, for 40 years, he struggled with the thought of, of fornication.

36:26.400 --> 36:31.680
And it's like, would he struggle with that for 40 years? He actually struggled actively with that

36:31.680 --> 36:36.320
for 40 years. Okay, so I need to stop complaining because seriously, I'm, there's no way that I'm

36:36.320 --> 36:46.160
doing that. So, Johan talks about this in connection with Plato and Socrates, he talks about it in

36:46.160 --> 36:51.520
terms of, he has a book called, Finite Transcendence, where he said that, but Theta was always

36:52.800 --> 36:59.600
trying to keep this tension alive between the relationship to transcendence and the acceptance

36:59.600 --> 37:08.240
of our finitude, of our mortality. And so I'm wondering then, if there is something like

37:08.880 --> 37:13.920
a feature of wisdom, I know you have your particular Christian commitments, and I'm not

37:13.920 --> 37:18.640
trying to trespass on those, but you're also not, you're not, you're not being offended,

37:18.640 --> 37:22.960
which I thank you for when I make these connections to other, other things, you find them, I think,

37:22.960 --> 37:28.960
valuable, at least in discussion, but make, there seems to be a feature of wisdom, which is this

37:28.960 --> 37:37.920
kind of tonus between, right, the aspiration in transcendence, and then the deep acceptance

37:37.920 --> 37:45.120
of our humanity and our mortality, and keeping them always together is, and there's a finesse to

37:45.120 --> 37:51.200
that, there's a dynamic shift, I can't give you a rule or a recipe for doing that, it's an ongoing,

37:51.200 --> 37:56.320
ever-evolving capacity, would you, would you, would you think that? Yeah, it's a motive, it's a motive

37:56.320 --> 38:01.280
being, it's a way of being, which is what will kind of hold those two things together, and I think

38:01.280 --> 38:07.360
your image of wisdom is particularly good in the sense that wisdom, at least in Scripture, at

38:07.840 --> 38:12.320
in the Bible, the way that wisdom is described, seems to really be the capacity for those,

38:13.520 --> 38:19.520
for, let's say, the, the, the principles or the ideals to be united with the particular,

38:19.520 --> 38:25.200
like that seems to be, you know, it's like, the wisdom always comes as like advice on how to,

38:25.200 --> 38:29.360
you know, how to find the good woman, or how to, how to live your life, how to deal with money,

38:29.360 --> 38:34.720
like that's how wisdom comes, but what it's, it's patterning something which is, which is above,

38:34.720 --> 38:40.800
you know. Yeah, Aristotle has that with Sophia and fromesis being brought together, right? Sophia is

38:40.800 --> 38:45.360
your grasping of these universal and profound principles, and then fromesis is how do you

38:45.360 --> 38:50.480
make them contextually relevant in a contextually sensitive manner. So this now brings me back around

38:50.480 --> 38:58.400
then. It sounds like this, this deeper reflection on, well, let's use the word sin for now, this

38:58.400 --> 39:06.640
deeper reflection on sin, you know, affords us what might be missing in what we're seeing

39:06.640 --> 39:14.800
in the demonstration, that, that, and this, this is part of my concern, that you talk about the,

39:14.800 --> 39:21.600
the, you know, inclusion as the sole value. I talked about something similar in that,

39:22.320 --> 39:28.800
that justice is the sole virtue and a very truncated sense of justice. The Greek sense of

39:28.800 --> 39:34.320
justice was always simultaneously external with others and internal with oneself. That's really

39:34.320 --> 39:39.520
clear. And what we have is a completely, we get none, we get a reduction of all the virtues to

39:39.520 --> 39:45.360
justice and then just the, the social aspect of justice, hence the name, social justice.

39:45.360 --> 39:51.360
Yeah, we're not sure exactly what, what that justice entails in terms of its particular,

39:51.360 --> 39:54.960
like how it's going to manifest. Well, and that goes to the point I want to make, because

39:55.920 --> 40:01.360
I, I, I, I have a concern that we are losing the other virtues. I mean, the Greeks had at

40:01.360 --> 40:06.080
least the cardinal four, and then the Christians had the next, the sacred three. And so we at

40:06.080 --> 40:10.720
least had, we at least have seven, we should be talking about, right? We at least have seven,

40:10.720 --> 40:15.200
we should be talking about. And we were just talking about one, one of the ones that's considered

40:15.760 --> 40:22.000
something like a meta virtue, which is wisdom. You know, I shared the, what I think one interpretation

40:22.000 --> 40:28.240
of Socrates, that Socrates saw that each virtue was a way of being wise in a particular situation.

40:28.240 --> 40:34.480
The virtues aren't separate things, particular ways of enacting. And so to me, if that argument is

40:34.480 --> 40:40.080
good, and I think it's a good argument, talking about justice without having concern for wisdom

40:40.080 --> 40:45.600
seems to me to be like really, really almost oxymoronic. It seems to be

40:46.560 --> 40:52.720
self-contradictory, self-undermining. And that's a very dangerous kind of thing to be for human

40:52.720 --> 40:58.800
beings to be embracing, embracing, committing yourself deeply to something that is self-undermining

40:58.800 --> 41:03.840
in its foundations is a very problematic thing to do. What do you think about that?

41:04.160 --> 41:11.680
No, I totally agree. And that's why it's one of the reasons, because the idea of the idea of justice,

41:13.040 --> 41:18.400
it seems to have something to do with equality, although it's ill-defined as well. Like,

41:18.400 --> 41:23.040
what exactly do we mean by equality and what, because obviously equality is a strange term,

41:23.040 --> 41:28.800
because you need a, you need a category to declare equality, because you can't have equality in

41:28.800 --> 41:34.160
everything, because then everything would just be the same. So equality is a complicated term,

41:34.160 --> 41:38.640
and so it seems like, you know, it's like, what is it, the intersectional, it's like the diversity,

41:38.640 --> 41:43.920
equity, inclusion, right? That's the, those are the three kind of values that kind of mesh together

41:43.920 --> 41:52.080
in this idea of justice. And so the difficulty is, of course, that the, like the revolutionary

41:52.080 --> 41:57.600
aspect of it is what you also talk about in the sense of it undermining itself,

41:57.600 --> 42:03.040
it ends up eating itself, and it ends up eating itself by its very mechanism, which is that

42:06.240 --> 42:10.000
I hate to say it this way, but it's, it's, it's inevitable to come to the fact that there is no

42:10.000 --> 42:16.720
such thing as equality, right? In terms of actual, totally equality, right? Because it does, what,

42:16.720 --> 42:20.640
what does it mean? Like, everybody's smarter, stupider than others, some are taller, some are

42:20.640 --> 42:24.480
shorter, you know, and, and, and it, it's individually true, and it's true in different

42:24.480 --> 42:28.800
categories and different cities, and it's like, there's difference, you know, you can't have

42:28.800 --> 42:36.400
equality. And so this like weird desire for equality ends up being, ends up being a kind of

42:36.400 --> 42:41.520
power play, it seems, not, not really a desire for equality, but a desire for power.

42:42.720 --> 42:46.400
So, so I wonder if there's something going on here, kind of displacement, because,

42:50.000 --> 42:52.960
and this, this is going to be really, you have to move very carefully here.

42:55.280 --> 43:01.520
So, so I think what people want to do, sorry, that sounds pompous, but it's hard to talk.

43:01.520 --> 43:08.080
It seems, it seems plausible to me to propose that what people want to do is reduce

43:09.040 --> 43:17.680
the suffering of pain and distress. And then they, and then they, they have, they're making a claim

43:18.320 --> 43:26.960
that most suffering or distress, or maybe all, right, is caused by inequality. And of course,

43:26.960 --> 43:34.880
there is truth to that. Yeah. What we, you know, when resources are not being distributed as fairly

43:34.880 --> 43:39.680
as they can, and fairness is not the same thing as equality, this is part of the problem, right,

43:39.680 --> 43:43.200
because justice is also supposed to be about fairness, not just about equality.

43:43.680 --> 43:53.200
And so when we do cause, we cause unnecessary suffering. So, so, so let me try and give you

43:53.200 --> 44:06.080
a bit of a sprite riff on this. I see the left as really sensitive to the fact that human beings

44:06.080 --> 44:11.840
are, I'll use a Greek term here, but you'll find a Christian analog, I'm sure, that human beings

44:11.840 --> 44:16.480
are really subject to fate, that there is just shitty things that happen to human beings because

44:16.480 --> 44:20.000
they're finite and they're limited, and the world is an overwhelming machine and there's

44:20.000 --> 44:24.880
historical forces and material forces, you know, you might even say powers and principalities that

44:24.880 --> 44:31.040
work, right? And people are just subject, right? And that we have to do, and that people therefore

44:31.040 --> 44:37.520
deserve our aid, even if they haven't earned it. Because if we don't do that, we are, and this is

44:37.520 --> 44:42.240
like the aspect of sin again, we're ignoring the fact that we are finite and we are subject to

44:42.240 --> 44:47.120
forces beyond our control. The left gets that, and I think the right tends to forget that,

44:47.120 --> 44:54.080
and that's why the right often comes off as cruel. But what the left forgets is what the right is,

44:54.800 --> 44:59.920
no matter how, you know, how haphazardly they do it and stupidly they do it, is the right tries to

44:59.920 --> 45:05.600
remind people that even though we are subject to fate and people should be aided beyond what

45:05.600 --> 45:11.440
they deserve or have earned, right? Human beings are nevertheless also responsible. They need to

45:11.440 --> 45:17.520
cultivate virtue, because every human being is beset by self-deception. And the only person that

45:17.520 --> 45:22.720
can get out of self-deception, I can't get you out of your own self-deception. I can give you

45:22.720 --> 45:28.800
guides, but you have to go through it. Like you have to go through it. I can't do that for you,

45:28.800 --> 45:34.320
right? So to put it in a slogan, you know, the left remembers fate and forgets virtue and the

45:34.320 --> 45:45.360
right remembers virtue and forgets fate. And so what I'm trying to get at is how could we change

45:45.360 --> 45:51.920
this discussion about justice so that we could put it back into what it was supposed to be paired with,

45:51.920 --> 45:59.120
which was suffraging, right? We pursued the external justice of trying to reduce the suffering of

45:59.120 --> 46:05.120
others that are caused by history and fate has to always be counterbalanced by Sopherson,

46:05.120 --> 46:13.040
the cultivation of the inner justice of virtue. And for the Greeks, it was axiomatic

46:13.040 --> 46:17.920
that you had to talk about those two things together. Somehow we have gotten to the point

46:17.920 --> 46:22.880
where we only talk about one side of this. And I find that also a very lopsided thing. Sorry,

46:22.880 --> 46:28.800
that was a long thing to say, but you're a deep thinker. I want to give you a lot to wrestle with.

46:28.800 --> 46:35.200
Yeah. Well, it seems like the way that at least when I look at the way that things happen in the

46:35.200 --> 46:41.920
Bible and kind of the way that emphasis that Christianity has put on it is obviously, Christianity

46:41.920 --> 46:48.320
is obviously very, very preoccupied with the poor, preoccupied with the poor in the broadest way you

46:48.320 --> 46:55.280
can interpret that. And those that have less, those that have little, whether it's, you know,

46:55.280 --> 47:01.280
whether it's the poor in terms of their own, let's say spiritual poor, or it's poor even

47:01.280 --> 47:06.320
physically in terms of their material poor, or it's the sick, or it's those that have no recourse,

47:06.320 --> 47:12.320
like the widow and the orphan. This is something that Christianity is extremely concerned about.

47:12.320 --> 47:21.120
But the way that Christianity seems to have concerned itself about it mostly is to ask

47:21.200 --> 47:28.480
those who have to give, to put responsibility on those who have to care for those

47:28.480 --> 47:38.160
who need to be cared for, rather than tell those who are lacking to go get theirs,

47:38.160 --> 47:44.240
right? To take it from those who have it. And that's really the difference between

47:44.240 --> 47:49.680
the revolutionary mindset and the Christian mindset. And some people might say, well, why

47:50.480 --> 47:55.680
why can't it happen? Like why can't those that have less just take, right? Take it back.

47:56.400 --> 48:00.960
And the reason is because, the reason is very practical reason. It's because it's a

48:00.960 --> 48:07.280
self-defeating pattern. The pattern which will, which will destroy itself because there's always

48:07.280 --> 48:11.760
someone who has less than you. And there's always someone who will be there to take from you, even

48:11.760 --> 48:16.000
though you think you are the one, you're the one who has less. And so you take from that one above

48:16.000 --> 48:19.760
you, but there's always someone below you who has less than you and will take from you. And

48:19.760 --> 48:26.640
as soon as you take from that one above you, the power especially, then you become the one who is

48:26.640 --> 48:32.960
now in the, you know, who's going to be shot. Like the story of Robespierre is obviously the

48:32.960 --> 48:38.320
most classic example of that happening. And so that seems to be the way that Christianity deals

48:38.320 --> 48:45.600
with it. And there are consequences if you don't. And the consequences need to be kind of put in

48:45.600 --> 48:52.960
the right position. The way I kind of say it is, I don't excuse the peasants for killing the king,

48:54.000 --> 49:01.200
right? But I still think it's partly the king's fault, right? It's still, it's still because

49:01.200 --> 49:06.160
the king didn't care for the peasants that the peasants ended up killing him. And I'm not justifying

49:06.160 --> 49:11.600
the peasants actions, but I am saying that if you don't care for the poor, at some point,

49:11.920 --> 49:18.160
it's going to happen. Like the, the, the people will come and take theirs if you don't care for

49:18.160 --> 49:22.320
them, but it's not morally justified that they do. I don't know if that makes sense.

49:22.880 --> 49:28.400
No, it does. I get what you're saying. But what I was, what I was trying to, well, maybe this

49:28.400 --> 49:34.720
is the way of bringing it back. Like, I'm trying to get to this notion that isn't just about equality

49:34.720 --> 49:38.960
or even equity. I'm trying, like, yeah, you know, you're right. Jesus does,

49:40.480 --> 49:46.080
both, you see Jesus and the Buddha, both. And they, what's interesting is they both do this.

49:46.080 --> 49:53.920
They both criticize equally something like cruelty and something like hypocrisy, right? And so

49:53.920 --> 49:58.720
what I'm saying is the, the, what we're trying to bring in here as we're trying to encompass

49:59.680 --> 50:06.160
the nature of human beings is that the notion of social justice, especially if it becomes

50:06.160 --> 50:12.080
just the pursuit of equality, does not have the machinery to deal with it. Jesus and the Buddha

50:12.080 --> 50:17.440
are neither left nor right. Like, it doesn't make sense to talk, right? Yeah, exactly.

50:17.440 --> 50:24.400
It doesn't make sense at all. Exactly. Right. And so the point is, in a very profound way,

50:25.040 --> 50:29.520
it's not that they're non-political, but they're, if you'll allow me, they're metapolitical. Oh,

50:29.520 --> 50:35.760
yeah. Right. They're trying to get at what, what are the values or the virtues people should be

50:35.760 --> 50:41.040
aspiring to that are the most responsible, and I mean both senses of the word responsible,

50:41.040 --> 50:48.320
to human nature, right? That's what I see them doing. And that's what I'm not seeing in this

50:48.320 --> 50:53.840
movement. I'm not seeing the wisdom of, you know, like we said, of trying to balance these

50:53.840 --> 50:59.120
things together of getting a deep understanding of human nature. I'm, I'm hearing a very, very

50:59.120 --> 51:07.760
superficial theory about human nature and human history and human culture. And, and, and I don't

51:07.760 --> 51:14.960
think that the version of justice, justice is, what really concerns me is this version of justice,

51:15.200 --> 51:20.560
it sounds so easy. And, and that means, that to me means it's got to be wrong, because I mean,

51:20.560 --> 51:25.120
what I get from all the great philosophers is justice, real justice. I mean, John Rawls writes

51:25.120 --> 51:31.680
this huge book, right? Like real justice is hard. It's really hard because human beings

51:31.680 --> 51:36.640
are so incredibly complex. And they have, as we've been talking about here, these, you know,

51:36.640 --> 51:44.080
these opposing forces and polls at work in them. That was a point I was trying to make, sorry.

51:44.080 --> 51:48.800
You're totally right. And I think that, like, if you look at this, if you look at how Christ deals

51:48.800 --> 51:54.480
with it, it's interesting, because, you know, we talked about responsibility. And you can see that

51:54.480 --> 51:58.320
in, you can see the way that Christ talks about, like he talks to the Pharisees, and he says you're

51:58.320 --> 52:03.680
a bunch of hypocrites. And he, he talks to woe to the rich, if you don't care for the poor,

52:04.240 --> 52:09.600
and woe to, you know, and blessed are those who are poor for they will receive and all of this,

52:09.600 --> 52:15.120
like there's all this and this, but he also has several parables where he talks about the poor,

52:15.120 --> 52:20.160
who don't care for what they have, and the consequences of that. Like he also has that he

52:20.160 --> 52:25.120
also has the parable of the talents where he talks about the servant who receives something and doesn't

52:25.120 --> 52:30.800
make it fruitful and therefore has to face the consequences of not making fruitful that's what

52:30.800 --> 52:36.000
she has. And so Christ talks of talks at all levels at the same time. You know, I always say, like

52:36.000 --> 52:41.760
you said, he's metapolitical. He's a judge and a victim. He's the king and the servant. He's all

52:41.760 --> 52:47.360
these things at the same time, in a very paradoxal way. And so he kind of transcends politics. And

52:47.360 --> 52:52.960
it's interesting to watch politicians, the politically minded, because they see in Christ

52:52.960 --> 52:58.720
a kind of weird mirror of themselves. So the people on the left see Christ as a kind of revolutionary

52:59.920 --> 53:05.520
figure. And the people on the right see Christ as a get your act together type figure. And it's like,

53:05.520 --> 53:10.480
well, you know what, there's neither of those really. Yeah, I think that was very well said,

53:10.480 --> 53:19.680
Jonathan. So what to do with this, what to do with this, this weird, the way that I think the way

53:19.680 --> 53:24.320
to understand it, and you know, you talked a little bit in our before our conversation started

53:24.320 --> 53:29.280
about the inevitability of religio. And I think that's really the way that's exactly where I

53:29.280 --> 53:35.440
wanted to go. This whole discussion seems to be pointing, right? It's making a very, I think,

53:35.440 --> 53:41.840
plausible argument about the inevitability of religio, the unavoidability of religio in

53:41.840 --> 53:47.760
human endeavor. And you made, and human existence, and you made this point, and I wanted to give

53:47.760 --> 53:53.920
you the opportunity to expand on it. You made a point of criticizing the new atheists, you know,

53:54.720 --> 53:59.920
in how they were sort of saying, if we could just get rid of religion, you know, and what they did

53:59.920 --> 54:06.000
is, you know, they identified religion with a, you know, belief in the supernatural, etc, etc.

54:06.000 --> 54:11.120
And if we just got rid of those false beliefs, then that would be it. And then your point is, well,

54:11.120 --> 54:15.280
the people that are in these marches, they're not advocating anything necessarily supernatural,

54:15.280 --> 54:19.280
something perhaps transcendent, but not supernatural, etc. They're not doing all,

54:19.280 --> 54:24.320
but nevertheless, look at the religious behavior, look at how comprehensive and powerful it is,

54:24.320 --> 54:29.520
and look at how much it's a response to the way the COVID crisis accelerated the meaning crisis.

54:30.640 --> 54:35.040
And you made that, and it was sort of a very brief thing. It was about two or three minutes in the

54:35.040 --> 54:39.200
video, but I wanted to give you, and I think this is a good context, you and I, in discussion,

54:39.200 --> 54:45.360
I wanted to give you the opportunity to expand on that. Yeah. Well, my criticism of the new

54:45.360 --> 54:49.920
atheists, you know, and I would use Stephen Pinker as the, as the main example, just because of

54:49.920 --> 54:52.960
the kinds of books he've written and the kind of statements he's made about

54:52.960 --> 54:57.280
enlightenment and this kind of progress and everything, is that,

54:59.440 --> 55:03.520
and I think that what you're doing is, is a much better, like the COGSI approach and the

55:03.520 --> 55:08.960
cognitive science approach is a much better approach to this, because there is, there is

55:08.960 --> 55:14.880
an understanding of what a human being is in a, in a deeper way. And, and there's an understanding

55:14.880 --> 55:20.160
of the reasons why we have certain patterns and the reason why certain things exist within us.

55:20.160 --> 55:26.560
And what, what the new atheist team to want to do is to see the advantage of reason,

55:27.200 --> 55:32.720
and then want to kind of box the human being in reason, and see everything which is outside of

55:32.720 --> 55:38.080
reason as the thing to get rid of, as the bad thing to get rid of. There's our original sin,

55:38.080 --> 55:42.640
is everything that's outside of reason needs to be eliminated. But the problem is that you

55:42.640 --> 55:48.160
can't eliminate it. You know, and, and there's a kind of weird utopian vision, and the example I

55:48.160 --> 55:55.040
always use is the example of sleep. You could say, and reason and, and, and awakenness, you know,

55:55.040 --> 55:59.440
and the idea of kind of this more, this other aspect of us in sleep, it's a good way to understand

55:59.440 --> 56:05.280
it. It's as if I told you, you could be way more productive, if you didn't sleep. Like you just

56:05.280 --> 56:08.800
have to not sleep, and then you could be awake all the time. And wouldn't that be amazing? Like

56:08.800 --> 56:12.400
then you would imagine how much progress you would make, like imagine how far you would go,

56:12.400 --> 56:17.920
if you would just stay awake all the time. But the reality is that you can't. That's not just,

56:17.920 --> 56:24.000
not part of being a human being. And so these other patterns that we have are there. And so,

56:24.000 --> 56:29.120
and they're extremely important. And if you try to get rid of them, what they do is they kind of,

56:29.120 --> 56:33.840
they go down for a little while, and then they come back like a monster, and then we'll swallow

56:33.840 --> 56:39.120
you. And that's what we're, those are the kinds of things we saw in the, in the French Revolution,

56:39.120 --> 56:46.000
in the Russian Revolution, all the kind of end of atheist cycle where all of a sudden the patterns

56:46.000 --> 56:51.280
come back like a big monster to devour you. And now we're seeing very similar things as well.

56:51.280 --> 56:58.400
We're seeing a secular religious manifestation. And it's akin to the one we saw in the French

56:58.400 --> 57:03.760
Revolution. And it's akin to the one we saw in the Russian Revolution. And so, and I always want

57:03.760 --> 57:10.000
to say, it's like the people who kind of made fun of Jordan Peterson talking about this, it's like,

57:10.000 --> 57:15.360
it's happening right now. It's happening right now. Look at what's going on. And you can just

57:15.360 --> 57:21.360
poo poo it. You can toss it to the side, but it's the same pattern happening again. And the reason

57:21.360 --> 57:29.440
for the pattern is the same, like the denial of, sorry, I get excited and I throw myself.

57:30.320 --> 57:37.840
Me too, me too. The denial of certain aspects of the human person is going to come back.

57:37.840 --> 57:44.240
And so the idea is what do you do? Like how do you deal with it? And to me, that's why I think that

57:45.520 --> 57:51.920
that's why I think that having a conscious religious aspect to you, that's why ritual,

57:52.720 --> 58:01.120
conscious ritual is important because ritual will be there. You can't avoid it. Now the question is

58:01.120 --> 58:07.120
whether or not it's part of you integrated or whether or not you're a slave to ritualized behavior

58:07.120 --> 58:13.360
and kind of scapegoat and identity forming behavior that is just part of existence.

58:14.320 --> 58:20.240
I think that was very beautifully said. Yeah, I agree. I think on the first point you made,

58:20.320 --> 58:24.800
but the COGSI and all the stuff on relevance realization and those aspects that are

58:24.800 --> 58:32.160
pre-rational and how primordial they are and the importance of ritual. So for those of you,

58:32.160 --> 58:36.000
I mean, you're watching this video, you know this work. And so there's arguments there and

58:36.000 --> 58:39.680
thank you, Jonathan, for gesturing to them. And then as you were building on that,

58:40.560 --> 58:44.400
I thought of this scene and you'll probably be able to riff on this because it's a mythology,

58:44.400 --> 58:48.480
it's from a science fiction classic, you know, Journey to the Center of the Earth.

58:49.040 --> 58:53.040
And especially in the movie version, Count Sacknessen, who's the villain,

58:55.040 --> 58:58.960
you'll see how this connects in just a sec. They come to him and they say, well,

58:59.920 --> 59:05.200
don't you sleep? And he said, I never sleep. I hate those little slices of death. And he

59:05.200 --> 59:10.320
represents exact, no, just, right, so the journey to the center of the earth, which of course has

59:10.320 --> 59:16.560
all kinds of mythic, you know, meanings attached to that, right? But he's the villain. And notice

59:16.560 --> 59:22.080
how he brings together like your analogy and how it connects back to an unwillingness to accept his

59:22.080 --> 59:29.760
humanness, his mortality, the hubris in here. And that cycles us back again to this refusal to accept

59:29.760 --> 59:37.280
our humanity. It's ultimately, it's again the same kind of, it's a puritanical kind of refusal

59:37.280 --> 59:47.600
to accept our humanity in a profound hubristic way. And that, and that I think is what, when I've

59:47.600 --> 59:53.760
talked to people, you know, who have sort of come out of the New Atheist movement,

59:55.360 --> 01:00:01.440
one of the things that they'll often say that started putting them off was they got a sense of

01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:10.800
arrogance attached to these people. And, you know, and I'm not talking about, and part of it is no

01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:16.320
doubt personality. There's narcissism and, but I think they might also have been putting out their

01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:27.840
finger on this, this sense that, right, there are aspects of our humanity that are not being given

01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:33.120
due. And this is what I mean again about justice, soffers and justice. Plato had this sense that

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:39.680
you had to give all of the parts of the human their due. They had to be given their due regard,

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:48.320
their due role, their due place. The attempt to eradicate was a deep mistake, right? And,

01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:54.720
and, right. And so this, this, the soffers and the inner justices, we have to give due regard

01:00:54.720 --> 01:01:02.400
and due place and due role for all aspects of our humanity. If you look at, if you look at the very

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:08.560
first commandment or the very first place in scripture where it talks about something which is

01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:15.840
holy is in the description of creation. And so you have six days, then you have the seventh day,

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:21.200
which is the day of rest. And it's the day which is set aside for God, right? It's the holy day.

01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:26.960
And, and right there in Genesis, it says that's why we, we follow the Sabbath. Now that there's a

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:33.200
mystery in that, which is very profound. And the mystery is that it's exactly the mystery that the

01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:39.360
New Atheists are impotent and capable of seeing, which is that the way that the world is made and

01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:44.480
the way that consciousness is made and the way that reason is made is because it's a patterning

01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:51.680
system. It can never encompass everything, right? It, it can be coherent, but it cannot be complete.

01:01:52.320 --> 01:02:01.280
And you need to leave a bit out for completeness to manifest itself, like in its, in its mystery.

01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:08.800
So you need to leave a bit on the edge that is not closed, that isn't tied up, that isn't

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:13.760
accounted for. There has to be some aspects which are not accounted for. If you try to

01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:20.960
account for everything, that's the, you know, that's the, that's the, the most dangerous thing,

01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:26.720
right? It's the, and if you also try to see that which is accounted for as totality,

01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:32.480
which is the sin of Satan, which is the sin of pride, which is the sin of Adam, that's the hubris.

01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:38.640
And then, then you fall because that aspect which you, which you, which you, which is supposed to

01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:46.400
be unaccounted for, which you're trying to ignore is still there, right? And, and the, the fascinating

01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:53.600
aspect of that margin or the, the, let's say the seventh day is that there are, it has two parts

01:02:53.600 --> 01:03:03.280
to it. It has a part which is the, the unfathomable of creation, right? The, the, the completeness of

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:09.840
creation, but it also points to the infinite. There's a secrecy in it, which also points to the

01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:16.160
infinite, which is why it's both the day of rest, but also the day set aside for God at the same time.

01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:19.680
So it's both death and the source of life at the same time.

01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:25.360
That's very interesting. Your invocation of Godel, I mean, I take Godel's theorem that you

01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:31.920
can't have a both complete and consistent to be an example of what I meant earlier by mortality.

01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:37.440
That's the mortality in the heart of any epistemological project or, you know, Heisenberg's

01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:43.120
uncertainty. That's the mortality in the, in the, in the heart of any empirical observation or

01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:50.640
investigation and, and more and more of these, right? And the, the, the, the history and philosophy

01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:54.880
of the last two centuries have been in philosophy of science, at least the more philosophical aspects

01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:59.840
of science have been the, been the discovery of this. I'd like your invocation of it because

01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:03.760
it brings me back around and, you know, and you, I, you, you may, I don't know if you're doing

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:08.800
it deliver it a little off, but you're invoking, I heard Levinas when you were comparing totality

01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:12.800
to infinity because he has a book around that, right? And how infinity is not the same thing as

01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:17.520
totality. Because totality is the pretense that you have both consistency and completeness.

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:22.560
That's my way of understanding it. And, and therefore it, like, if you take the Goli, Goli,

01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:29.760
Goli's argument seriously, and you should, right, that is always a dangerous pretense.

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:37.200
And that the problem with any, any system that claims to be complete and consistent is that it

01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:46.480
is actually a deep form of self deception. Oh yeah. That's for sure. So I mean, and this is what,

01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:50.880
you know, this was, this is the great for all of the criticisms I have of them. This is the great

01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:56.160
thing that comes out of the whole pragmatism movement of James and Pierce and Dewey and more

01:04:56.160 --> 01:05:01.440
recent people, you know, like Quine and Davidson. And they've had a deep influence on me. I haven't

01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:05.600
had a chance to talk about them very much. I will in another series. But the point I'm trying to get

01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:12.960
to here is, like, there's a, there's a shadow side of the utilitarianism. There's a negative version

01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:18.800
of it, which is strategies of eradication, because eradication is an attempt to be completely

01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:24.240
consistent and complete. So there's an argument, and I'm not advocating for all of his ideas,

01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:28.880
but I just want to give due credit. Coleman Hughes makes this argument about, look,

01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:34.800
we all agree that murder is a deeply immoral act. And I'm not playing around with terms. Well,

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:39.280
sometimes you kill, but when we say killing that's not immoral, we don't call it murder. Murder is

01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:44.000
the name for the killing we regard as immoral. So let's not play that game. So we guard murder as

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:50.320
immoral, but we don't pursue an eradication strategy in our society. Because if we were to

01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:58.560
eradicate, try to eradicate murder, we would so, we would so subject ourselves to a radically

01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:07.200
dehumanizing totalitarian state that, and that's why no culture anyway doesn't, right? Every culture

01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:12.560
has prohibitions against murder. There's variations on it, of course, but you don't see them saying,

01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:15.920
and what we're going to do is we're going to set things up so that murder is impossible.

01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:18.320
You know, Philip, that's a Philip K. Dick kind of situation.

01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:22.800
Oh yeah, it's a scary thing. No, and you're right about the strategies of eradication.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:31.200
These are extremely frightening because they tend towards exactly what you're talking about.

01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:36.400
And I'm afraid that I see the same, you know, and I'm afraid that I'm seeing that right now

01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:43.440
with COVID. I'm seeing exactly a falling into a strategy of eradication where we think that we

01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:54.080
cannot continue to live until this virus ceases to exist. This is not how it works. This is a

01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:59.520
dangerous because the method you will use to eradicate the virus, the totalitarian method

01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:06.480
you will use will be extremely harmful. They will be very, very harmful to our health,

01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:11.440
to our community, all of these things. And it's like the difficulty that you understand

01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:16.960
the desire to eradicate because it's a bad thing, right? This virus is a bad thing. You want it to

01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:22.960
go away, but once you enter into that strategy of eradication, especially with techno states,

01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:31.280
where you are develop the power to push that capacity of eradication to limit that we're

01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:38.240
not seen before, it's a very, very frightening situation. A clear example of that is the proposal

01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:45.120
that we start tracking everybody's movement, every movement. I say people, do you really want the

01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:50.480
state to have that power? Do you really want the state to have that power? Do you really want the

01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:55.280
corporations to have that power? They already have that power to some degree and they use it to

01:07:55.280 --> 01:08:03.600
manipulate you. Look, I can't believe it. I saw a BBC article just a few days ago and it was just

01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:07.760
like a regular article where they're talking about what the future of travel will look like.

01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:15.120
And in their description of the future of travel, they talked about vaccines with identification

01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:21.520
in the vaccine that they can scan your body so that you, and this was a BBC article. It wasn't

01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:25.840
a conspiracy article. It wasn't like someone, it was like, this is what travel is going to look

01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:31.520
like. They'll scan your body to know whether or not you have the vaccine and they'll let you

01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:38.640
participate in social things depending on whether or not they can track you. It's like, my goodness,

01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:43.440
don't you watch science fiction movies? I don't know. Am I the only one who watch

01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:50.320
science fiction movies? Well, I watch them too. So, I mean, and we have to be careful here. So,

01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:56.880
COVID is very bad. Oh, yeah. No, no, no, I want to make an analogy here. COVID is very bad and you

01:08:56.880 --> 01:09:03.200
should try as much as we can ameliorate it, but with wisdom, toggling against over empowering the

01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:09.680
state and taking a dehumanized view or a simplistic view of human nature in order to

01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:15.360
achieve it. So, we don't push for eradication. We push for amelioration that doesn't cost us too

01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:22.160
much our humanity. Isn't that the same attitude we should take for how to deal with the very

01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:29.360
real evil of racism that we should try which, and we should continue to try to ameliorate it?

01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:34.640
But we shouldn't, you know, I talk a lot about how you frame the problem. It is way more important

01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:42.240
the method about actually solving it. Should we be adopting a mindset that is a totalitarian

01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:48.720
kind of eradication about something like racism? It strikes me that argument by analogy means

01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:55.600
there is a sense in which we can go too far on this. And that doesn't, I hope, that doesn't make

01:09:55.600 --> 01:10:00.960
me a racist. And what I've seen is I saw the interview with Don Lemon and I forget the name

01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:07.520
of the actor and he was trying to say, he's a black guy. And he's trying to say, I'm just saying

01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:13.920
that some of the leaders of the movement are going too far to extreme. That's all he was proposing

01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:21.680
and he was treated with smugness and dismiss and then this horrible argument by Lemon.

01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:27.680
Well, people accuse Martin Luther King of being too extreme as if, well, are you saying that

01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:32.240
because sometimes people have misused that word that every time they use it, they're misusing it?

01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:38.080
That's a really stupid argument. Can we have a better argument, please? And it's like, if we

01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:46.000
can't even bring up the question that we might be framing the attempt to achieve a goal, a lot of

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:51.200
a goal that I fully support, then I think we're in a very, very bad place. I think we're getting

01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:58.080
into a very bad place. Yeah. And you're right. Because one of the things COVID did was awaken

01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:07.680
in us this pattern of infection. And it awakened in us the pattern of infection and the desire

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:15.760
to exclude and eradicate. And now it's being politicized. Not the COVID. It's weird because

01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:24.080
you can see that there's no narrative connection between COVID and Floyd, but there is a pattern

01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:29.920
connection. And you can see that it's awakened the pattern and now it's playing out in the political

01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:35.200
sphere. Well, I mean, isn't that a case? Again, I'm talking at the latent level, not at the

01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:40.880
manifest label, but that seems like a case, a clear case of what a psychodynamic person would

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:47.840
call displacement. COVID puts you like you're suddenly in the Old Testament. I don't mean

01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:52.240
that pejoratively. But you have this ubiquitous, threatening things out there in the world,

01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:58.720
and you have to adopt this very insular purity code. And then you don't know when it's going

01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:10.320
to strike you. And then it might be infected. But now what we can do is we couldn't do anything

01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:14.480
about the COVID, but I think what your suggestion is, but I can do something about this over here.

01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:21.680
Can do something about, yeah. And the danger of the racist thing is the limit of it, because the

01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:28.000
limit is the problem with racism is that it's this invisible thing in the sense that it ends up being

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:34.480
thoughts and feelings in people. And the idea that you can reprogram someone and that you can

01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:39.680
move towards the eradication of thoughts and feelings. I mean, we know where that leads,

01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:44.640
like we know where that goes. And because it can't happen, then like we said, like I said before,

01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:49.120
but it's going to end up looking like a scapegoating, where we're going to choose some,

01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:55.200
we're going to find examples that we can drag out in public and, you know, and have struggle

01:12:55.200 --> 01:13:00.560
sessions, watch struggle sessions and have them be humiliated in public so that we can deal with

01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:07.520
the problem of eradicating something which is, which is unconscious bias. Like it's unconscious.

01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:15.680
So you can't, how can you eradicate it? Well, I think trying to eradicate that is,

01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:21.680
I mean, given what we've argued, isn't that the same? It's ultimately committing you at some

01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:27.280
level to eradicating the machinery of humanity. That's right. Right. And so,

01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:36.000
let's say that this is, I've been more and more attracted to René Girard in the past year, I

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:40.480
would say, you know, just because of everything that's happened. And I've been seeing that his

01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:47.760
analysis of the situation is really one of the wisest in terms of the way that he interpreted

01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:53.440
what's happening and intersectionality. I mean, he passed away, I think around 2010 or maybe a bit

01:13:53.440 --> 01:14:00.160
later. You know, he talked about, I saw a quote of his in 2007 where he talked about the machine of

01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:06.720
Antichrist, which is ramping up. And he saw exactly what we're seeing. He said, it'll be infinite

01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:12.960
victimhood looking for infinite scapegoat. And so it's like this perpetual wheel of victimhood,

01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:18.240
which is looking perpetually for more and more scapegoats, like almost like a self-devouring

01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:25.840
machine. And so we're seeing it. The solution is, like I hate to, I know you dislike when I

01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:34.320
push it too far, but the solution is the image of the scapegoat being the murderer and this,

01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:39.840
and the victim at the same time, right? Identifying with Christ and identifying with those that killed

01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:47.600
him. Identifying with the capacity to exclude and the reality of also being excluded to a certain

01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:53.520
extent. Like those two things together, if you can kind of, you can integrate them properly and not

01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:59.600
in a weird disorderly manner, can help you have compassion for those who are excluded, but can

01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:04.960
help you also understand that you are one of those who do that all the time. You're always doing it.

01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:11.840
But this is what I meant. I think there's power under argument. I've only read the one book and

01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:17.520
I'm not completely at the one I saw on Satan Fall like lightning. But the idea that you can

01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:22.800
explode, if you'll allow me to use some of my terms, you can explode the cultural cognitive grammar

01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:27.680
of scapegoating and that the Christian mythos does that. I thought that was one of the most

01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:33.040
powerful arguments. And it's a new argument, as far as I know, one of the most powerful

01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:38.000
apologetic arguments for Christianity that I had heard in quite some time. So I think that

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:45.680
is a good point that you brought up. But I think it's situated within this larger past again,

01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:51.600
which we can keep coming back to, of trying to get to a place where we can simultaneously accept

01:15:51.600 --> 01:16:01.280
faith and virtue. Because one of the ways in which you can address people's thoughts and feelings

01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:09.600
is by inspiring them to aspire to virtue. Rather than trying to eradicate, you can try to inspire

01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:17.040
the aspiration to virtue. And this has been, to my mind, a very, very successful strategy,

01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:22.960
where I've been talking a lot recently, and Akira the Don did the meaning wave about it,

01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:27.520
about stealing the culture. And I actually use Christianity as a primary example of that,

01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:33.120
that Christianity doesn't try and overthrow the political structure. What it does is it steals

01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:38.400
the culture. It creates an entirely different culture from the bottom up. And then, because

01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:44.560
the problem, to my mind, what the French Revolution shows is you can radically transform the state,

01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:49.280
but if you don't transform the underlying cultural, cognitive, grammar, and normativity,

01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:56.160
nothing is fundamentally going to change. Yeah, you just changed the ones who are holding the

01:16:56.560 --> 01:17:05.200
reins. You circulate the elites. Exactly. Whereas what Christianity does is it builds a new

01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:10.560
civilization. Buddhism does the same thing. It builds a new civilization. Islam does the same

01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:18.320
thing. It builds a new civilization. And so that brings us, and we don't have much time, I suppose,

01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:24.240
but that brings me towards the third point. You said, you sort of despair of knowing what to do.

01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:34.240
And I'm wondering if you, I'm sorry, I realized I might be daring the pro-Hasturist thing with

01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:39.440
proposing some sort of a Christian thing to a Christian, which is a ridiculous thing.

01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:47.840
But I gave you all of those examples. And to my mind of the idea of, well, isn't the response to

01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:55.440
do as much as we can to engage in building the next culture? And that sounds preposterous,

01:17:55.440 --> 01:18:01.760
but a commitment to that kind of thing seems to me to be the most responsible response

01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:09.760
to the depth of the situation we are in right now. Yeah. No, I think so. I would say on a

01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:17.360
personal level, love God, love your neighbor is a pretty good thing to live by in the immediate

01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:23.280
reality and not abstract categories to deal, you know, to love the people that you encounter with,

01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:28.960
to see in them the face of God is something that will transform at least your life. It's harder

01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:36.080
in terms of like a social responsibility. For sure, myself, the way that I frame it,

01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:43.280
that's why I'm doing what I'm doing. What you said is that I'm trying to help people see the

01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:49.200
grammar of culture or see the pattern. And of course, one of the things I've been emphasizing

01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:54.160
the most is the importance of the margin and talking about the margin in a balanced way so

01:18:54.160 --> 01:19:00.320
that you neither have the desire to, because both sides want to eliminate the margin. Everybody

01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:05.920
wants to eliminate it. They want to eliminate the margin either by making it the same as the center,

01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:10.720
by integrating all the marginal aspects and making them equal to everything else,

01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:16.800
or by eradication or by cutting it off. And that's the real problem with the,

01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:24.160
it's the question we had during the first wave of violence of the 20th century. You had two sides.

01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:30.000
You had one side which wanted to create an equal utopia and one which wanted to create

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:36.560
a hierarchical utopia that cut off the margin, that burned it off. And we're facing the same,

01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:41.200
it's like we didn't deal with it. We're facing the same problem now. And we're seeing the one side

01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:48.240
now, we're seeing the side that wants everything to be equal. But I always tell people that

01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:55.200
when the Nazis came to Germany, they were on the verge of a communist revolution. The pendulum

01:19:55.200 --> 01:20:00.880
doesn't move in one direction. The pendulum swings and it's a scary thing to watch.

01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:08.800
But this is part of the way in which again, the way in which this lack of, the lack of

01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:16.720
of a dynamical nuance in thinking. So, you know, Leo Ferraro and I talk about this idea that

01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:23.680
in living systems and right, you see opponent processing. And I've argued, right, and that

01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:29.520
what an opponent processing means, this is the way you deal with trade-offs. And we've been talking

01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:32.960
about trade-offs all the way through, right? You have opponent processing, you like your

01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:37.200
parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system. Like the sympathetic nervous system is biased.

01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:41.120
It tries to interpret everything as a threat or an opportunity and it arouses you. And the

01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:44.720
parasympathetic system is biased and it tries to interpret everything as a signal that you should

01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:49.680
relax and calm down. And they're working, their biases work in opposite direction, but they're

01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:54.000
functionally integrated together because that's how you get the most self-corrective system.

01:20:54.320 --> 01:21:00.160
And what we're supposed to have, and you can see this in Dewey, right? Because we're supposed

01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:05.760
to have a point processing, but what it's devolved into is adversarial processing.

01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:11.920
And this is the eradication idea. Now it's a zero-sum game. I've given up the idea of

01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:16.080
self-correction. I've given up the idea of commitment to a process that you and I, even

01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:21.760
though we disagree, we can commit to. Like you and I do in dialogue. We have disagreements,

01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:26.880
but we see the potential that we can correct each other in valuable ways that we mutually

01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:33.440
appreciate. There was that commitment and that commitment to that process has been lost.

01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:40.880
Like the fact that most Americans are more distrusting of the opposite party than they are

01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:46.160
a foreign threat. Like what the heck does that mean? What does that mean to you?

01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:56.320
And so the adversarial eradicate the other, destroy the other, zero-sum game mentality,

01:21:56.320 --> 01:22:03.360
I think has made the process, I think, is broken. I think the process is broken.

01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:10.480
And so I don't know. I don't see how, I mean, and Layman Pascal and others,

01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:14.320
they disagree with me on this. I don't know how to work within that in a way.

01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:20.000
And so that's what I mean by steal the culture, that I don't know if working within that machinery

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:27.120
is a viable strategy. I think no strategy has to be, you know, Jonathan, I was at a conference

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:32.960
two weeks ago called the Movement Summit. And there's all these communities of practice

01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:40.160
springing up everywhere or trying to integrate mindfulness and movement practices and discourse

01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:47.520
practices and so many of them. And, you know, these people, and they all want to talk to each

01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:55.120
other and they want to network. And it felt very different. This is, it felt very, it was neither,

01:22:55.120 --> 01:23:01.440
you know, the revolution of the left or the law and order of the right. It was orthogonal to that.

01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:08.960
It was these people trying to seriously time and talent and money and energy and commitment

01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:16.240
to the cultivation of wisdom and a deeply alternative way of being. And to my mind, that's

01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:21.600
where, and I know you think it should be given a particular Christian splint, but I also think

01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:26.640
you're charitable enough to include other people of good faith who are willing to work with you.

01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:32.160
I think that's where the answer to the more difficult problem lies. I think there is stuff

01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:37.280
actually happening right here, right now, culturally, symbolically, existentially,

01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:41.440
that is where the difference that is needed is starting to be generated.

01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:48.720
Oh, but I, for sure, agree. I think that the seeds of the, like a way to see it is like that

01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:55.440
this is horrible because it has bad implications, but like the seeds of the next world will appear

01:23:55.440 --> 01:24:02.080
in the current one, right? They're just hard to see, you know, the little sprouts are hard to see

01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:08.560
because everything else is burning in the forest, right? So it's difficult to see the seeds as this

01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:14.960
is kind of breaking apart. And I mean, I'm curious to see how all of this will be integrated. I do,

01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:20.480
I do, again, like, you know, we've talked about this before. So we're not going to come to a

01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:29.360
conclusion, but I do think that there is a need for a narrative cohesion. And I do think that until

01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:36.240
until something happens in the West, it's still, it's still the Christian narrative. So I don't,

01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:41.040
I don't see a way out of it for at least, you know, I don't see a way out of it. So, but I,

01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:46.240
I appreciate, I do think that the questions that people are asking and that the desire for wisdom

01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:53.520
and the desire for transformation is one which will bear fruit. It won't, it has to, if it's done

01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:57.920
with sincerity and done, you know, in a desire for transformation, it will bear fruit.

01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:04.160
Yeah. And the point I'm trying to make is thank you for saying that. And you know, from my part,

01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:10.080
I don't, I don't ever claim to have a foreclosure argument against Christianity. I always say that

01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:16.880
I do not have such a fit. But what I was trying to emphasize is there's not only sincerity,

01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:23.600
there's depth in like what's going on here. It has the appreciation for humanity and complexity.

01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:28.400
That's what I'm seeing in these people in this movement. Of course, we're all flawed human

01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:33.280
beings. I'm not, I'm not painting some utopic vision, but I'm talking about, you know,

01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:41.680
a real, a real possibility and the acknowledgement that I think it's, it's, it's, it's in existence.

01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:46.480
I like your metaphor for all the ways it's fraught, but I do like your metaphor of the seeds. I do

01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:50.240
like putting the two together, that the burning of the forest actually fertilizes the seeds in the

01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:54.880
way they need to be fertilized. And perhaps you were alluding to that and your right smile.

01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:59.680
Yeah, but it's not, it's not a fun. It's not fun. Like it's not pleasurable.

01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:06.000
No, there's, and it means, it means death and suffering. Yep. And I have kids and I don't want

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:13.520
this, but I want and what needs to happen are not always the same thing. Yeah. Jonathan, I think

01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:21.040
maybe this would be a good place to bring it to a close. So I proposed to you privately and you

01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:26.160
already agreed. So I'm going to do it publicly. I think that you and I and Paul should have a,

01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:31.600
have a discussion like this, the logos, as I would call it, at length for the three of us.

01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:36.080
And I'd like to invite you and then I've also invited Paul and let's, let's try and work to

01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:41.440
make it happen because I think it would be very beneficial for all of our respective listeners.

01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:45.040
Yeah, that would be great. I would, I would love that. We, let's set it up.

01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:52.160
Okay. So I'll reach out to Paul and I'll try and make it happen. So I found, well, you could see,

01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:57.920
I got passionate, which means this was definitely, this is definitely the logos for me. I always say

01:26:57.920 --> 01:27:04.320
that the difference between the logos and monologue is both people find themselves adduced. They find

01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:08.640
themselves drawn to a place they couldn't get to individually on the road. And there's a kind

01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:12.880
of education and then that that's very different from just sort of thinking in your own head.

01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:17.840
And so I always find that the case when I get into such a dialogue with you,

01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:22.960
and I wanted to thank you for it. You had so many, so many insightful, brilliant ways,

01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:29.120
so many insights and brilliant things you said. And not only what you said, the manner in which

01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:34.480
you said the imagery that you use was itself often deeply helpful. So thank you very much.

01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:38.800
Thank you very, very much. Well, you know, I really, I always enjoy talking to you and I,

01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:42.400
and I really appreciate the insight you're bringing to the conversation. And I'm

01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:47.760
looking forward to seeing where this is going and kind of how, how this is slowly going to,

01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:52.480
let's say play dance together is the best way to maybe to say it.

01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:57.040
Yeah. Yeah. I agree. I agree. Okay. So thank you very much.

01:27:57.040 --> 01:27:58.960
All right, John. It was good to talk to you.

01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:00.800
Good talk to you. All right. Bye-bye.

01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:01.440
Bye-bye.
