0	5640	Welcome, everyone, to Voices with Raveke.
5640	16240	I'm joined by and with my good friend, Jonathan Pajot, whose work on the symbolic world deeply
16240	23400	resonates with a lot of what I've been doing work on, and as many of you know don't know,
23400	29720	and I find Jonathan brilliantly insightful, and his reflections on the symbolic aspects
29720	37480	of existence and his ability to reshine and refurbish these stories so that they can shine
37480	45720	for us again is often, you know, it sort of catches you, it's deeply impressive.
45720	47600	So thank you, Jonathan, for coming.
47600	48880	Oh, it's my pleasure.
48880	53760	I always enjoy talking with you, you know, ever since I discovered your work and kind
53760	58080	of discovered the language which you're developing also to talk about these subjects.
58080	59680	It's been really helpful to me.
59680	66320	I find myself thinking in the categories that you are bringing forth and especially speaking
66320	73840	to kind of a secular audience or also convincing Christians that the words they use have meaning,
73840	78360	you know, because sometimes we have this kind of internal language and it stops to actually
78360	81920	be meaningful in the world and it just becomes like a kind of magical language.
81920	87800	So I've been using your expressions on attention, the idea of relevant realization, all of these
87840	92280	expressions have been good to help people re-see things in a different frame so that
92280	93280	they understand them.
93280	96680	So I really appreciate our discussions for sure.
96680	99760	Well, thank you for saying that, Jonathan.
99760	107440	I aspire to this being true, that above and beyond trying to, you know, convince or persuade
107440	113760	people about my specific claims, truth claims, theoretical claims, proposals, practical endeavors,
113760	114760	etc.
115000	123800	I aspire that I do afford, you know, a vocabulary and a grammar for people that helps them to
123800	127160	clarify and develop their thinking.
127160	131440	I mean, that's the art, that for me, that's the way in which I try to enact the Socratic
131440	135600	ideal of being the midwife, right, the midwife for other people.
135600	138680	So thank you for saying that, that means a lot to me.
138680	143080	So what I wanted to start off specifically talking about, you released two excellent
143080	147600	videos, and I'll put the links to them in the description of this video.
147600	154320	One was on, I won't get the actual verbatim name, one was on sort of the religious nature
154320	159120	of a lot of the demonstrations that are happening around that were sort of galvanized into existence
159120	161800	by the death of George Floyd.
161800	169040	And then you did a follow-up, they were sort of like part one and part two, one on the
169040	172720	iconoclasm, the destruction of images, the pulling down of statues.
172720	180120	And one of the things you did was you put your finger on a huge important aspect of this
180120	188000	that is being completely ignored in the mainstream media, but I think is of vital importance.
188000	194760	As has happened in the past between you and I, I, very convergent, I was coming to very
194760	198680	similar concerns and reflections.
198680	201880	And I'd said some things early on about how COVID was going to accelerate the meaning
201880	207960	crisis and cause just a mental health tsunami, and you'd see a proliferation of conspiracy
207960	216360	theory thinking, you'd see purity code behavior, human beings are going to respond in a fashion
216360	220640	to this invisible ubiquitous threat that's causing them to isolate.
220640	226720	And as you, I liked your invocation of the symbolic idea of fasting for most of their
226720	228200	connections.
228720	232360	And then I saw all of that.
232360	243000	And then when the protests began, I had, so I had a reaction that made me sort of refuse
243000	247160	myself from committing, commenting on that publicly.
247160	251720	Part of it was a concern that what you said in your first video of just, you know, saying
251720	256360	something that would be premature polarizing, it was difficult to say anything that was
256360	260560	going to be heard with, that had any kind of nuance or reflection to it.
260560	264680	So part of it was just that kind of caution.
264680	265920	But there was a deeper issue for me.
265920	271000	I was very concerned, and I, I talked to my close friend about this, that I would fall
271000	276880	into a kind of self deceptive bias when I tried to talk about any of this.
276880	283240	So give me a moment, please, I don't mean to trespass on your patients, but I wanted,
283240	286320	in order to try and articulate this, and this has helped me upon reflection, I wanted to
286320	290720	invoke Weber's distinction between the manifest and the latent function.
290720	298400	So to give you a classic example, you know, Weber talked about the manifest, the manifest
298400	303400	function of the bureaucracy is to facilitate, you know, information traveling upward and
303400	308120	decision and struggling downward, and that's its manifest function, but it has all kinds
308120	309120	of latent functions.
309120	313360	It has the latent function of allowing people to diffuse responsibility and shift blame
313360	314360	on to others.
314400	317280	And Kafka, of course, brought this into high art.
317280	322720	He showed us how the latent function can, you know, put us into a tragic situation because
322720	328960	our commitment to the manifest function binds us in a tragic fashion to the latent function.
328960	333680	That can be antithetical to it in, in, in kind of a profound way.
333680	342160	And so I was, I was, I'm watching this and, and I, and I'm saying, well, yeah, that, that's
342160	347200	horrible and racism is a horrible thing and what we're seeing happening here.
347200	352760	And there's definitely, I know this because, you know, what's happened since, you know,
352760	356560	9-11 in the Patriot Act, there's been the militarization of the police.
356560	359840	And that has been a very dangerous thing, right?
359840	363200	And I know there's, there's, there's nasty tricks happening.
363200	367880	There's voter suppression happening and all kinds of bad things.
367880	374320	And people are feeling, I think legitimately manipulated and disenfranchised in powerful
374320	375320	ways.
375320	380320	And this, and this is meshing in ways that we're all finding it hard to understand with
380320	384320	a history that has disadvantaged certain groups of people.
384320	388240	And all of this is going on and I'm saying, yes, these are issues that all get addressed.
388240	392760	So my, I don't mean to sound Freudian here, but my sort of conscious explicit awareness
392760	394200	is going, yes, yes, yes.
394200	400040	But I'm having this negative visceral reaction to all of this and I'm trying to go, what's
400040	401040	going on?
401040	405120	And at first I'm, oh, you know, I'm making all these things and I, and I, and I can
405120	406120	feel it.
406120	407120	I'm in the grip of something.
407120	412840	And so I'm talking about this with my friends and I'm reflecting on it and, you know, journaling
412840	413840	about it and everything.
413840	420040	And I'm coming to realize, oh, oh, and Jonathan, you know that I respect your allegiance to
420040	421040	Christianity.
421040	422600	I'm talking about me here.
422600	423600	Okay.
423600	431640	So I said, oh, this reminds, I'm back in my fundamentalist church and I'm the 10 year
431640	432640	old again.
432640	437520	And I'm being traumatized by a puritanical form of Protestantism.
437520	442720	I'm being told that I have an original sin that I, not because of any act that I committed,
442720	446200	but that is just because of how I was born.
446200	450440	And that there's an aspect of this that is unforgivable, no matter what I do.
450440	456080	And everything I try to do to overcome this just makes it that much worse.
456080	465480	And that I need, I need to be absolutely contrite and guilty until some external obscure authority
465480	472320	will finally pronounce me, you know, you know, saved or whatever.
472320	477040	And that, and then what this, what this brings with it, you know, is bonfires.
477040	479360	And I mean, I'm not, I'm not being hyperbolic, Jonathan.
479360	483600	I'm talking about gathering behind the church and putting the rock and roll albums and the
483600	486440	books into a thing and lighting it on fire.
486440	487600	Like can you imagine?
487600	488600	Oh yeah.
488600	489600	I've been through that too.
489600	492240	I grew up with that kind of stuff as well.
492240	493240	Okay.
493240	501440	And so, and, and, and so I'm realizing that the latent functionality of this is so reminiscent
501440	511480	of kind, of a kind of puritanical fundamentalist Protestantism, and again, I was noticing the
511480	516560	same things you're noticing, you know, the acts of contrition, the throwing down of the
516560	521040	stones in the high places, like from the Old Testament, right, where the prophets are always
521040	528720	doing that, right, the kneeling and the confessions and the statement that there's nothing I can
528720	531160	do about it other than feel guilty.
531160	536280	I was noticing how this is, was tremendously religious.
536280	542600	And that, that, as I said to others, that upbringing, like that upbringing traumatized
542600	543600	me.
543600	547000	I mean, I remember, I remember going to the minister and the church with my mother when
547000	552280	I, because I read the Bible regularly, daily, and, and I came across the passage in the
552280	554760	New Testament about the unforgivable sin.
554760	555760	Oh yeah.
555800	562040	Oh, and this just, I fell into, I mean, Cartesian skepticism was nothing compared to the well
562040	566480	I fell into about, well, how do I know what it is?
566480	569280	And how do, and how, like, did I just do it?
569280	571040	And if it's unforgivable, I'm now doomed.
571040	572840	I'm doomed, right?
572840	577720	And that feeling of being doomed and trapped and, and, and, you know, and I went to him
577720	582080	and I want, what I wanted was a clear definition of what it was.
582800	589040	And, and, and I got, I just got, you know, the usual, you need to have faith and, and
589040	590040	it was very unhealthy.
590040	596560	And so I, and so I was realizing, oh, John, you better keep your mouth closed about, because
596560	601040	even if you want to speak about this, this is just going to come flowing through you
601040	606720	because, and it's, and you're going to, it's a, because you have an incredible bias.
606720	611640	It's very hard for you to see this in a positive light, even though sort of intellectually
611680	615600	you can understand these important things that we've already mentioned, you know, the
615600	622520	rate, the, the, the racist history, you know, the, the, the, the subversive disenfranchisement
622520	627560	of people, right, the militarization of the police, all of these things are real and they
627560	628560	need to be addressed.
628560	634360	But, but I realized if I try to say anything about this, my chances of speaking in a way
634360	637360	that I think is clear, we're like going to be seriously undermined.
637360	640960	So I just sort of held back, but then I saw your videos.
641440	645680	And I thought, well, maybe I, maybe with Jonathan's help, I can talk about this.
646600	648880	Sorry, I don't intend this to be a therapy session.
648880	650000	That's not what's going on here.
651560	655760	I want to be really, I want to be really open with you about where I'm coming from.
656120	663720	And I think your video actually points out that this tension, well, let me, I might be
663720	668560	too bold. It suggested to me that this tension that I'm finding in myself is not exclusive
668560	674520	to me, that I, I sensed in you, not to the degree I'm talking about, but also a tension
674520	680080	between, you know, what this might be sort of at a manifest level, and then this unacknowledged
680080	685320	latent function of religiousness, and then you have some criticisms, at least implicit
685320	690960	of this, you had towards the end, you, you warned of danger in the, in the first video,
690960	696680	because the, the, the religion that does not know that it's a religion is not oriented
696680	701200	towards the ultimate. And so there's like a, like a critique coming like via, like, or
701200	705640	similar to what Tillich would meant. You're, it's, it's ultimately, it's an idolatrous for
705640	710880	all of its bringing down of images. It's ultimately an idolatrous religion. And then I was thinking
710880	718520	about this, I was thinking about how, you know, that politics is, is, has in many ways taken
718520	724400	over the domain of religion. I don't think well, it's drenched the 20th century in blood.
725240	731040	But I know that, well, there's sort of two, because religions are supposed to have, like
731040	735000	you said, there's supposed to be moments of communitas and transformation. And I'm trying
735000	738560	to think, well, what are, what are the only rituals left to politics? Well, there seem
738560	742920	to be two. And I was noted how they seem to split between the right and the left. There's
742920	748840	the demonstration of the protest or the rally. And the right likes the rally and the left
748840	753600	likes the demonstration protest. And then I'm thinking, and both of these, we have good
753600	758200	historical evidence, don't bring about the new man, the new person, the transformation
758200	762760	of human beings. And, you know, and all of the revolutions left then, right, the French
762760	767640	Revolution, et cetera, onward, show that it doesn't bring about that, although there
767640	772720	is often religious goal within the French Revolution, and, you know, they worshiping
772720	777280	the goddess of reason and all that stuff, right? It doesn't actually bring about the
777280	787400	promised transformation that it is groping towards. And so I was thinking that, is it
787400	796200	possible to talk about this sort of in terms that are kind of metapolitical about the latent
796200	802600	functionality of the religion, and at that level, legitimately criticize it without thereby
802720	808840	implying that we think, well, I'll speak on my behalf, not yours, without thereby implying
808840	815040	that I think that we shouldn't do something about militarization of the police, the subversive
815040	819920	suppression of voting and disenfranchisement of people, and then how that has often allied
819920	826320	itself with historical factors that are ongoing of racism, et cetera. That's what I'm proposing
826320	831520	to. Is it possible? And I'd like to try and explore that with you. But that's sort of
831560	832600	the frame I want to set up.
832880	838920	Yeah, I think for sure there's, I think there are a lot of things to deal with, and what you said, a
838920	843920	lot of things to kind of unpack at different levels. I think that maybe we can kind of separate
843920	849440	them in the in different parts so that we don't get completely jumbled. One is to look at the
849440	858800	possible reinterpretation of your experience, I'd say, or the notion of the original sin, then
858840	864720	the idea of Adam or the fall of Adam, what that can mean, and how we can reinterpret that in a
864720	871280	manner which is more useful than your traumatized youth. And I understand because I went through all
871280	877440	the stuff you dealt with, I went through the same. And even the description of like the idea of
877440	881600	blaspheming the Holy Spirit and everybody wondering, like, did I blaspheme the Holy Spirit? You
881600	888760	know, all of that, I understand. But I think there are ways to reappropriate the stories, those
888760	893440	stories. And I think we appropriate is I also believe one of the reasons why I went towards
893440	899840	orthodoxy is because they have a different vision of the fall of Adam, one which I think it has a
899840	907000	healthier balance. So that's one. And then the other is then looking also at the way in which these
907000	917760	protests or COVID and the protests together kind of just exploded into a kind of weird catharsis. And
917800	924760	what that means and what it's kind of looking towards. And so sadly, the third part, which would
924760	929880	be like how to get out of this kind of this bind that we're in is the one which I don't know.
930000	934600	Like I really, a lot of people ask me, so what should we do? And I'm looking around. And I think I
934600	939440	don't know what to do, except I don't know what to do socially. Like I think I know what to do
939440	944960	personally. But I don't think I know what the societal solution is. So maybe that one will be
944960	948760	harder. Well, but I do want to talk about that because I've been talking about that with other
948760	956280	people as well. So, but I'm happy with your proposal. But like I said, I'd like to put it, like
956280	967120	I said, into the way in which what's happening, it has, you know, at the level of the latent
967120	971640	functions, there's, well, you said it, I want to use your words, there's something dangerous
971680	977640	happening in this as well. And I want to explicate and draw that out. I'm happy to hear your
977640	982680	revisions. And so I don't know what to call it. Let's say revisioning rather than revision. Yeah,
982720	989720	of these, of these stories. And then, but if you could put that into dialogue with, because, okay,
989720	994240	let me, let me instead of making a statement, let me make, ask a question that's kind of a
994240	1006800	request. I see in, you know, I see an analog to a strong analog in this movement to that version
1006800	1011040	of original sin that I was brought up with. And let's remember that the word Protestant means
1011040	1016920	those who protest. I mean, right there. And I was brought up in a church where, you know, protesting
1016920	1023040	and constantly declaring what was evil, and what should be burnt or, you know, and that that was
1023240	1032280	that was daily, the kind of practice. So do you think that I'm incorrect in saying that the version
1032280	1036880	of original sin, whether or not it's the right version, I'm going to give you space to talk about
1036880	1043240	that. But do you think that that that, you know, maybe overly Augustinian version of original
1043240	1048920	sin is what's at play in this movement right now? Am I incorrect about that?
1048920	1053720	No, I think you're definitely right. I think you're definitely right. One of the, and I think
1053720	1059680	it's something that we've seen before, in the sense that maybe an inverted version of what we've
1059680	1066840	seen before in terms of like racialized vision of the world in the past, which is that we've taken
1066840	1074080	the notion of original sin, and we've brought it down into biology, which is the scariest thing
1074120	1080120	that can happen because it actually is inevitable. Like it actually does become inevitable because
1080120	1085960	it's related. It's linked in a, not in a really scientific way at all, but in a mythological
1085960	1093640	way, it's still brought into a term which is using language of kind of biological identity or
1093680	1101480	categories, which are material categories. And so the idea of this racialized guilt, or, you know,
1101480	1109120	was there in kind of 17th century racism, like kind of neo Darwinism, kind of social Darwinist
1109120	1114640	racism, this idea that, that certain races were inferior by their own biology and therefore were
1114640	1121000	made to be slaves or were made to be the lower. And now we're seeing a kind of weird reversal of
1121000	1129040	that, where we're saying to be a certain race is in itself to be the oppressor, like to be, to be
1129080	1136960	white, is to be guilty of the, the sin of the revolutionary thinking. Like, it's kind of like,
1137000	1144720	it's, it's not completely original sin. It's, it's like the end of the revolutionary trend in, in
1144720	1148760	thinking, right, the French revolution, the Marxist revolutions. And now we've come to kind of the
1148760	1155240	end of it, where we're actually bringing it into almost a biological reality, where the guilt of the
1155240	1162200	oppressor is a racial guilt. And it's, and that's, that's, so that, so like you said, it does relate
1162200	1168280	to original sin, because it means that as someone who has that identity, whether it's actually
1168280	1172640	legitimate, scientifically or not, it doesn't matter, they're still framed in those categories. As
1172640	1179360	someone who has that identity, I have no way out. Like I have no way out, except for two things,
1179360	1187640	which are people are doing, which is to self-flagellate and to scapegoat. That is to put myself
1187640	1193560	on the, to put myself on the side of find someone guiltier than me and yell at him and tell him that
1193560	1198760	he has to be canceled and he has to be excluded from society. The only, the only two solutions.
1198800	1205240	Yeah. And that, like I said, I went through periods where the church I was in would be
1205240	1213000	driven to bits by exactly that process repeatedly in cycles again and again and again. And when I
1213000	1219280	sort of, when I sort of woke up to that, I was like, Whoa, this is like, like, when I started
1219280	1224080	reading some literature and I realized that the literature like showed me what human beings
1224080	1227560	could be other than this, that was like, so.
1228200	1233600	But you're right. In the Protestant sense, like if you think of Protestant sex and you notice both
1233600	1241120	the Puritanist kind of self-flagellation of complete depravity, and then the systematic notion
1241160	1247120	that all of a sudden, the group I'm in is not pure enough. They're not close enough to the truth. They're
1247120	1253200	not, and then removing myself with a little, a smaller group, and then condemning those on the
1253200	1259280	outside as being, as it's like an acceleration. It's always been there. It's there in every, every
1259360	1263520	structure. Like we can talk about that, but there's an acceleration of it in the kind of
1263520	1269040	fragmentation of Protestantism. And we see it in intersectionality to an extent which becomes
1269040	1274240	completely absurd where, you know, at some point it's so obscure that most like regular people don't
1274240	1279680	even know what you're talking about when trans exclusive this and then trans inclusive. And we
1279680	1283760	don't, most people are like, I don't understand. And then it's, there's smaller and smaller
1283760	1288640	identities which are excommunicating other identities and you don't know what's going on.
1288720	1294960	Yeah. So I mean, that, to my mind, that is the meaning crisis on steroids or methamphetamine or
1294960	1303040	something. So what, and I think given the deeply deleterious effects which we're seeing, you and
1303040	1307280	I were talking just before we hit the record about, you know, we're seeing, you know,
1308400	1313280	you know, people are like, they're people that we're normally sort of very sane, like in our
1313280	1317840	personal relationships are moving more towards the fringe and they're filled with anxiety and
1317840	1322080	they're describing their experiences surreal. I think, you know, the deleterious facts of the
1322080	1329360	meeting crisis are being exacerbated by COVID and then perhaps by certain latent aspects of this.
1330000	1337680	But I wanted to give you the opportunity to make good on your promise that there's an alternative
1337680	1343760	way, there's an alternative way. And I mean, I'm interested in this both philosophically
1344400	1349840	and personally. I typically try not to get too personal in these conversations, but this one
1349840	1353760	has to be different for the reasons I've already articulated. And I'm putting my trust in you
1353760	1361200	about this. So that there's an alternative way of conceiving of the myth of original sin. And you
1361200	1366480	know, I use that word in not in a pejorative fashion. But and so what do you, what is that
1366480	1372880	alternative understanding to your mind? So the way to understand it is to clearly differentiate
1372880	1380160	between sin and death. They're related, but they're they're different. And so in scripture,
1380160	1386720	it says the wages of sin is death, right? And there's an idea that even in the in the scripture,
1386720	1392400	it never says that we inherit the sin of Adam, it says that that we, because of Adam's sin, we are,
1392960	1398400	we are in death, like we are in the, in the, in the, in, we are living in a world of death.
1398400	1405600	And that's really the best way to, to understand it, which is that sin causes death. So you,
1405600	1412800	you have a purpose, you miss the mark. And that's, that's what death is. And so there's a,
1412800	1418080	there's a brokenness that you break the system breaks down as you miss the mark. And this is
1418080	1423680	happens at every level of reality, whether it's in your own life or in society or, or entirety of
1423680	1430800	the world. When, when something misses the mark, then there's a breakdown, which happens. Now we,
1430800	1439280	we inherit the breakdown of that, which is before us, right? We inherit death. So we are born in
1439280	1444320	families that have missed the mark. We are born of parents that have missed the mark. We are born
1444320	1450800	of systems that have missed the mark. And so because of that, we, we live in a world which
1450800	1456560	has an aspect of it, which is broken. We still have the aspiration of hitting the mark. And that's,
1456560	1462080	that's what kind of guides us and makes us want to live, but we have to live with the consequences
1462080	1470560	of that, of that, of that miss. And the difficulty is that when you're in a world of death, that is,
1470560	1476640	when you inherit the consequence of sin, so when your parents miss the mark, and they will, and we
1476640	1483760	know they do, you inherit that. And it makes it more difficult for you to hit the mark because you
1483760	1490640	have all the baggage which comes and you have inherited the, the, the patterns of being that
1490640	1496160	will make that worse, right? Which will, which will increase the brokenness, which will tend to
1496160	1502640	fragment. Okay. And so that's the manner in which we need to understand original sin. That's what
1502640	1511120	it is. It's the inheritance of brokenness. So, so that, and I hope, I hope you take this as a helpful
1511120	1520000	thing. That to me reminds me of, you know, certain interpretations of the Buddhist notion of karma,
1520000	1527360	that there are these patterns at work, and, and we, and we inherit them, and they affect our
1527360	1533440	behavior, and they cause suffering. And the way I sort of understood this, at least psychologically
1533440	1540720	and existentially is, as you said, you know, we, we pick up from others, our parents, our friends,
1540720	1545760	and our culture, we pick up, and that, you know, here's where historical racism does matter, right?
1545760	1553520	We pick up patterns that are shaping us and moving us in ways that are detrimental to our
1553600	1560160	aspirations. Is that, is that a fair? Yeah, exactly. Yeah. But the idea is, the idea is,
1560160	1567280	of course, the very desire, the very aspiration that is the very possibility we have of conceiving
1567280	1574640	the good, and of seeing the point that we're aiming at, right, of, of seeing it in our view and,
1574640	1584720	and moving towards it, right, is, is the very, how can I say this, is the reminder that we are not,
1584720	1590480	that we don't fit in this broken world, that we are, that we are, we find dissatisfaction in the
1590480	1596240	brokenness. And so that's what causes our suffering. But it's also what, what can ultimately cause our
1596240	1601760	hope, because we see, we can see that we're not made, like there's something in us which
1601840	1607200	wants more than this brokenness and this, this world of death. There's something in us which is,
1607200	1613520	which can see that which we can aim towards, and which is the good, of course. And so that is really
1613520	1621920	the, and so what, let's say what Christianity shows us, and like what Christ shows us, is that
1622720	1632720	the manner to reach the, the manner to reach the, the, the aim in the brokenness is to a certain
1632720	1640320	extent embrace death. And that's really the, that's the hardest thing is to embrace death consciously,
1640320	1645760	embrace the, the brokenness consciously. And therefore we're, we don't become slaves of that
1645760	1650800	brokenness, right, is to see your sins, to see the place where you miss the mark, instead of just
1650800	1655040	blaming your parents, because that's what you will want to do, right? You want to blame your parents,
1655040	1660000	you want to blame the system, and you're right to, because the system is broken. Your parents are
1660000	1665440	broken. Everything, there's an aspect of everything that's given to you, which is broken, not fully,
1665440	1670640	but there is an aspect of it, which is broken. And the solution is to, is to actually rather see
1670640	1678720	your own death, the places in you that you're, that you're dead and recapture the, the vision,
1678720	1684880	right, recapture the, the aim. So this, this brings me to a central question that I have
1684880	1689360	about this. Thank you for that. I think that was very helpful. So let's shift the discussion
1689360	1695760	onto mortality then. And the interesting thing, of course, and you're aware of this, I know,
1695760	1699920	in the Greek world is mortality has a, and Heidegger developed this a lot, it has a much more
1699920	1704720	encompassing notion to it. And then that'll help lead me to my question to you. You know, because
1704720	1710320	one of the great sins, and I think this is the right word in the Greek world is hubris, right,
1710320	1720000	which is to, in some sense, forget your mortality, right, and to think that you can, that, that you
1720000	1723840	can be a God. And, you know, and this is captured in great literature, you know, Conrad's Heart of
1723840	1729280	Darkness, which of course is now a contentious work, but nevertheless, Kurtz's big sin is hubris,
1729280	1735040	right? He forgets. And Marlowe's, Marlowe's heroism is he commits himself to his humanity,
1735040	1740480	that he will preserve his mortality. And I've been talking to my son about this, because,
1741120	1748560	you know, he lives with me now, partially because of COVID. And, you know, I've been exposing him to
1748560	1752000	certain ideas, and he's going, but, you know, but I want certainty. And I'm saying, well,
1752720	1758880	you, yeah, but you can't, part of what being, you know, be embracing your mortality is to
1758880	1764320	realize that no matter how good your idea might be, you're ultimately a fallible human being,
1764320	1770400	you're finite. And he was like, but I don't like this. And I said, but your mortality isn't just,
1771280	1776240	right? And you'll see how this connects to what you said in a second. Your mortality isn't the fact,
1776240	1781760	you know, like in Tolstoy's Ivan Illich. Ivan Illich knew he was going to die, right? It's not,
1781760	1787200	it's not that. Your mortality is that, like you said, in some fundamental way, you know, we are
1787200	1794240	finite, we are broken, we are not gods. So, and I'm seeing this in my discussion with him, how do
1794240	1800000	you, how do you, because I'm trying to work this with him as a father, getting people to embrace
1800000	1806640	their mortality is good, because it prevents inflation, it prevents hubris, it prevents, I
1806640	1813120	suppose it would prevent blasphemy too, from a Christian perspective. And as you said, it helps
1813120	1820480	people to not, not to fall into the error of, by criticizing others, I implicitly remove myself
1820480	1829760	from that criticism, right? I see all of that. How do we do that without the, without traumatizing them?
1830080	1838800	I'm sorry, I'm sorry, that was a bit of a garden path. No, no, I, I think there, I think there has
1838800	1844560	to be, look, I'm sorry that I'm going to say this, but I think that trauma is part of the
1844560	1850080	experience, like I think that death is, we don't want to be cruel, but we don't want to be cruel,
1850080	1856080	is what I'm saying. No, no, right. No, I understand, but death is, death is, is traumatic, like there
1856160	1863760	is a trauma in death. And so we need, like the, the church fathers and the, the ascetics,
1863760	1868320	they always say two things, they say, remember God and remember death. Like those are the two
1868320	1872160	things you need to remember. I always kind of joke around and say, you know, that's the, the
1872160	1877920	Christian version of, of like mindfulness, you know, it's like remember God, remember death, right?
1877920	1884640	And so the idea is that if you, if you are, if you kind of remain in your death,
1885360	1890240	that like you said, you avoid all the problems that you talked about. And the, the strange paradox
1890800	1894800	in Christianity is that by doing that, you actually do become God.
1896080	1901360	Yes. Like you, you, you actually do become deified ultimately if you do those two things, right?
1902400	1906880	But, but it's a non-inflationary. Exactly. And that's the kind of the paradox of,
1906880	1913760	it's the, the paradox of, of, of creation and the paradox of, of the Garden of Eden, which is that
1915600	1920560	if Adam had submitted to the will of God and not eaten of the fruit of the tree,
1921360	1926320	then God would have given him the fruit of the tree. That's the, that's the tradition, right?
1926320	1931280	That's what many saints have said. And not only that, but that, that would have been his access
1931280	1935120	to the tree of life, which would have been perfect communion with the divine. And so
1936000	1940240	it is in humility that we actually reach the highest.
1940240	1943840	Yes. It's interesting. I just read this morning, when I was doing my lecture,
1943840	1949040	Divina, a Rilke's passage where he talks about, we throw a ball into the infinite,
1949040	1954320	and then it returns to us differently. It returns to us heavier. And it's only in that,
1954320	1958480	in, in, in having done that, that we actually get to feel the true weight of things.
1959440	1962960	And it sounds like you're saying something very analogous to that.
1963840	1971760	So how do we avoid the trauma? All I can say is the idea is obviously to place the trauma
1971760	1978240	ultimately to place it in Christ. Like the ultimate trauma, right, is, is communion. Like
1978240	1984080	that's the ultimate trauma. If you really take communion seriously, you are engaging in a
1984080	1992000	traumatic experience. You are eating the flesh and blood of the God man. Like you are, you are
1992000	1996320	at the foot of horror. Like, you know, you talk about horror a lot in your, in your, in your,
1998160	2002720	in your lectures. And I, one of the things I do want to bring up to you is that that is why
2002720	2007920	communion, one of the aspects of communion is to bring you into that horror in a manner which
2007920	2012880	will, which will save you and not destroy you, right? In a manner in which you can integrate it
2012880	2019840	in, that it's both a participation in horror and a communion of love at the same time in a
2019840	2025440	paradoxal way. Yeah. I mean, well, maybe we can talk about this at some point. I mean, I do think
2025440	2032800	the other sacred brings in simultaneously the symbol on, right? The horrific, the horrifying
2032800	2039520	function and the homing function in a profound way. And that, that goes back to, so, I mean,
2040480	2046480	there's two things I want to say. One is like, I'm trying to, but there's a, there's a notion of
2046480	2052480	mortality and isn't it in the symbolism of carrying your cross that's analogous to the
2052480	2059840	Buddhist notion that mortality isn't just death, but that the idea that moment by moment, I'm dying.
2059840	2065280	There's, there's little deaths all the time. And that if I try to avoid that, if I try to
2066320	2072320	get some kind of permanent hold on things, I'm, I'm, I'm just going to, I'm going to cut myself
2072400	2078240	on that. And then I'm going to cut other people. It's, again, is that, is that a, is that a
2078240	2082960	correct analogy? Yeah, of course. Yeah. Like if you look at, if you look at the prayer of Jesus,
2082960	2087920	the, the basic mystical prayer of the church, it has two, it has two parts, right? It says,
2089040	2095120	it has an invocation. It says, Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me as center. And so
2095120	2099680	it's like, there's this invocation and this remembrance of my own brokenness, remembrance
2099680	2105680	of my own incapacity. And so those two movements simultaneously, they're the ones that will,
2107440	2113840	and it's, and it's, it's also, and because I think one of the problems of the, of the trauma
2113840	2120320	of the Protestant is to a certain extent, the idea that it's weird, like the idea that you
2120320	2127120	should be pure, right? That you should be, but you can't. And so it's like, what, then what,
2127120	2134560	what do you do, right? You just remain in this strange broken, broken self. But if you rather
2134560	2142160	see it as this, this necessary part of being a human person and moving towards the good, then
2142160	2148640	it, then it's not as traumatic because you, you will then see that even the saints lived in,
2149200	2153920	you know, in the most difficult temptations that the saints were struggling with their passions,
2154000	2161120	you know, and those who reached the highest had the same frustrations you did. Like they, no one
2161120	2166000	pretends to be, if you, there isn't like the holier, the person that's holier than now. And
2166000	2171200	that kind of just, if you read the lives of the saints, you see the story of broken people who
2171200	2176480	their whole life struggle with thoughts and with temptations, you know, and are delivered by God.
2176480	2181280	But it's like, okay, if they struggled, so for 30 years, you know, you read, you read crazy stories
2181280	2186400	of the saints where it's like, for 40 years, he struggled with the thought of, of fornication.
2186400	2191680	And it's like, would he struggle with that for 40 years? He actually struggled actively with that
2191680	2196320	for 40 years. Okay, so I need to stop complaining because seriously, I'm, there's no way that I'm
2196320	2206160	doing that. So, Johan talks about this in connection with Plato and Socrates, he talks about it in
2206160	2211520	terms of, he has a book called, Finite Transcendence, where he said that, but Theta was always
2212800	2219600	trying to keep this tension alive between the relationship to transcendence and the acceptance
2219600	2228240	of our finitude, of our mortality. And so I'm wondering then, if there is something like
2228880	2233920	a feature of wisdom, I know you have your particular Christian commitments, and I'm not
2233920	2238640	trying to trespass on those, but you're also not, you're not, you're not being offended,
2238640	2242960	which I thank you for when I make these connections to other, other things, you find them, I think,
2242960	2248960	valuable, at least in discussion, but make, there seems to be a feature of wisdom, which is this
2248960	2257920	kind of tonus between, right, the aspiration in transcendence, and then the deep acceptance
2257920	2265120	of our humanity and our mortality, and keeping them always together is, and there's a finesse to
2265120	2271200	that, there's a dynamic shift, I can't give you a rule or a recipe for doing that, it's an ongoing,
2271200	2276320	ever-evolving capacity, would you, would you, would you think that? Yeah, it's a motive, it's a motive
2276320	2281280	being, it's a way of being, which is what will kind of hold those two things together, and I think
2281280	2287360	your image of wisdom is particularly good in the sense that wisdom, at least in Scripture, at
2287840	2292320	in the Bible, the way that wisdom is described, seems to really be the capacity for those,
2293520	2299520	for, let's say, the, the, the principles or the ideals to be united with the particular,
2299520	2305200	like that seems to be, you know, it's like, the wisdom always comes as like advice on how to,
2305200	2309360	you know, how to find the good woman, or how to, how to live your life, how to deal with money,
2309360	2314720	like that's how wisdom comes, but what it's, it's patterning something which is, which is above,
2314720	2320800	you know. Yeah, Aristotle has that with Sophia and fromesis being brought together, right? Sophia is
2320800	2325360	your grasping of these universal and profound principles, and then fromesis is how do you
2325360	2330480	make them contextually relevant in a contextually sensitive manner. So this now brings me back around
2330480	2338400	then. It sounds like this, this deeper reflection on, well, let's use the word sin for now, this
2338400	2346640	deeper reflection on sin, you know, affords us what might be missing in what we're seeing
2346640	2354800	in the demonstration, that, that, and this, this is part of my concern, that you talk about the,
2354800	2361600	the, you know, inclusion as the sole value. I talked about something similar in that,
2362320	2368800	that justice is the sole virtue and a very truncated sense of justice. The Greek sense of
2368800	2374320	justice was always simultaneously external with others and internal with oneself. That's really
2374320	2379520	clear. And what we have is a completely, we get none, we get a reduction of all the virtues to
2379520	2385360	justice and then just the, the social aspect of justice, hence the name, social justice.
2385360	2391360	Yeah, we're not sure exactly what, what that justice entails in terms of its particular,
2391360	2394960	like how it's going to manifest. Well, and that goes to the point I want to make, because
2395920	2401360	I, I, I, I have a concern that we are losing the other virtues. I mean, the Greeks had at
2401360	2406080	least the cardinal four, and then the Christians had the next, the sacred three. And so we at
2406080	2410720	least had, we at least have seven, we should be talking about, right? We at least have seven,
2410720	2415200	we should be talking about. And we were just talking about one, one of the ones that's considered
2415760	2422000	something like a meta virtue, which is wisdom. You know, I shared the, what I think one interpretation
2422000	2428240	of Socrates, that Socrates saw that each virtue was a way of being wise in a particular situation.
2428240	2434480	The virtues aren't separate things, particular ways of enacting. And so to me, if that argument is
2434480	2440080	good, and I think it's a good argument, talking about justice without having concern for wisdom
2440080	2445600	seems to me to be like really, really almost oxymoronic. It seems to be
2446560	2452720	self-contradictory, self-undermining. And that's a very dangerous kind of thing to be for human
2452720	2458800	beings to be embracing, embracing, committing yourself deeply to something that is self-undermining
2458800	2463840	in its foundations is a very problematic thing to do. What do you think about that?
2464160	2471680	No, I totally agree. And that's why it's one of the reasons, because the idea of the idea of justice,
2473040	2478400	it seems to have something to do with equality, although it's ill-defined as well. Like,
2478400	2483040	what exactly do we mean by equality and what, because obviously equality is a strange term,
2483040	2488800	because you need a, you need a category to declare equality, because you can't have equality in
2488800	2494160	everything, because then everything would just be the same. So equality is a complicated term,
2494160	2498640	and so it seems like, you know, it's like, what is it, the intersectional, it's like the diversity,
2498640	2503920	equity, inclusion, right? That's the, those are the three kind of values that kind of mesh together
2503920	2512080	in this idea of justice. And so the difficulty is, of course, that the, like the revolutionary
2512080	2517600	aspect of it is what you also talk about in the sense of it undermining itself,
2517600	2523040	it ends up eating itself, and it ends up eating itself by its very mechanism, which is that
2526240	2530000	I hate to say it this way, but it's, it's, it's inevitable to come to the fact that there is no
2530000	2536720	such thing as equality, right? In terms of actual, totally equality, right? Because it does, what,
2536720	2540640	what does it mean? Like, everybody's smarter, stupider than others, some are taller, some are
2540640	2544480	shorter, you know, and, and, and it, it's individually true, and it's true in different
2544480	2548800	categories and different cities, and it's like, there's difference, you know, you can't have
2548800	2556400	equality. And so this like weird desire for equality ends up being, ends up being a kind of
2556400	2561520	power play, it seems, not, not really a desire for equality, but a desire for power.
2562720	2566400	So, so I wonder if there's something going on here, kind of displacement, because,
2570000	2572960	and this, this is going to be really, you have to move very carefully here.
2575280	2581520	So, so I think what people want to do, sorry, that sounds pompous, but it's hard to talk.
2581520	2588080	It seems, it seems plausible to me to propose that what people want to do is reduce
2589040	2597680	the suffering of pain and distress. And then they, and then they, they have, they're making a claim
2598320	2606960	that most suffering or distress, or maybe all, right, is caused by inequality. And of course,
2606960	2614880	there is truth to that. Yeah. What we, you know, when resources are not being distributed as fairly
2614880	2619680	as they can, and fairness is not the same thing as equality, this is part of the problem, right,
2619680	2623200	because justice is also supposed to be about fairness, not just about equality.
2623680	2633200	And so when we do cause, we cause unnecessary suffering. So, so, so let me try and give you
2633200	2646080	a bit of a sprite riff on this. I see the left as really sensitive to the fact that human beings
2646080	2651840	are, I'll use a Greek term here, but you'll find a Christian analog, I'm sure, that human beings
2651840	2656480	are really subject to fate, that there is just shitty things that happen to human beings because
2656480	2660000	they're finite and they're limited, and the world is an overwhelming machine and there's
2660000	2664880	historical forces and material forces, you know, you might even say powers and principalities that
2664880	2671040	work, right? And people are just subject, right? And that we have to do, and that people therefore
2671040	2677520	deserve our aid, even if they haven't earned it. Because if we don't do that, we are, and this is
2677520	2682240	like the aspect of sin again, we're ignoring the fact that we are finite and we are subject to
2682240	2687120	forces beyond our control. The left gets that, and I think the right tends to forget that,
2687120	2694080	and that's why the right often comes off as cruel. But what the left forgets is what the right is,
2694800	2699920	no matter how, you know, how haphazardly they do it and stupidly they do it, is the right tries to
2699920	2705600	remind people that even though we are subject to fate and people should be aided beyond what
2705600	2711440	they deserve or have earned, right? Human beings are nevertheless also responsible. They need to
2711440	2717520	cultivate virtue, because every human being is beset by self-deception. And the only person that
2717520	2722720	can get out of self-deception, I can't get you out of your own self-deception. I can give you
2722720	2728800	guides, but you have to go through it. Like you have to go through it. I can't do that for you,
2728800	2734320	right? So to put it in a slogan, you know, the left remembers fate and forgets virtue and the
2734320	2745360	right remembers virtue and forgets fate. And so what I'm trying to get at is how could we change
2745360	2751920	this discussion about justice so that we could put it back into what it was supposed to be paired with,
2751920	2759120	which was suffraging, right? We pursued the external justice of trying to reduce the suffering of
2759120	2765120	others that are caused by history and fate has to always be counterbalanced by Sopherson,
2765120	2773040	the cultivation of the inner justice of virtue. And for the Greeks, it was axiomatic
2773040	2777920	that you had to talk about those two things together. Somehow we have gotten to the point
2777920	2782880	where we only talk about one side of this. And I find that also a very lopsided thing. Sorry,
2782880	2788800	that was a long thing to say, but you're a deep thinker. I want to give you a lot to wrestle with.
2788800	2795200	Yeah. Well, it seems like the way that at least when I look at the way that things happen in the
2795200	2801920	Bible and kind of the way that emphasis that Christianity has put on it is obviously, Christianity
2801920	2808320	is obviously very, very preoccupied with the poor, preoccupied with the poor in the broadest way you
2808320	2815280	can interpret that. And those that have less, those that have little, whether it's, you know,
2815280	2821280	whether it's the poor in terms of their own, let's say spiritual poor, or it's poor even
2821280	2826320	physically in terms of their material poor, or it's the sick, or it's those that have no recourse,
2826320	2832320	like the widow and the orphan. This is something that Christianity is extremely concerned about.
2832320	2841120	But the way that Christianity seems to have concerned itself about it mostly is to ask
2841200	2848480	those who have to give, to put responsibility on those who have to care for those
2848480	2858160	who need to be cared for, rather than tell those who are lacking to go get theirs,
2858160	2864240	right? To take it from those who have it. And that's really the difference between
2864240	2869680	the revolutionary mindset and the Christian mindset. And some people might say, well, why
2870480	2875680	why can't it happen? Like why can't those that have less just take, right? Take it back.
2876400	2880960	And the reason is because, the reason is very practical reason. It's because it's a
2880960	2887280	self-defeating pattern. The pattern which will, which will destroy itself because there's always
2887280	2891760	someone who has less than you. And there's always someone who will be there to take from you, even
2891760	2896000	though you think you are the one, you're the one who has less. And so you take from that one above
2896000	2899760	you, but there's always someone below you who has less than you and will take from you. And
2899760	2906640	as soon as you take from that one above you, the power especially, then you become the one who is
2906640	2912960	now in the, you know, who's going to be shot. Like the story of Robespierre is obviously the
2912960	2918320	most classic example of that happening. And so that seems to be the way that Christianity deals
2918320	2925600	with it. And there are consequences if you don't. And the consequences need to be kind of put in
2925600	2932960	the right position. The way I kind of say it is, I don't excuse the peasants for killing the king,
2934000	2941200	right? But I still think it's partly the king's fault, right? It's still, it's still because
2941200	2946160	the king didn't care for the peasants that the peasants ended up killing him. And I'm not justifying
2946160	2951600	the peasants actions, but I am saying that if you don't care for the poor, at some point,
2951920	2958160	it's going to happen. Like the, the, the people will come and take theirs if you don't care for
2958160	2962320	them, but it's not morally justified that they do. I don't know if that makes sense.
2962880	2968400	No, it does. I get what you're saying. But what I was, what I was trying to, well, maybe this
2968400	2974720	is the way of bringing it back. Like, I'm trying to get to this notion that isn't just about equality
2974720	2978960	or even equity. I'm trying, like, yeah, you know, you're right. Jesus does,
2980480	2986080	both, you see Jesus and the Buddha, both. And they, what's interesting is they both do this.
2986080	2993920	They both criticize equally something like cruelty and something like hypocrisy, right? And so
2993920	2998720	what I'm saying is the, the, what we're trying to bring in here as we're trying to encompass
2999680	3006160	the nature of human beings is that the notion of social justice, especially if it becomes
3006160	3012080	just the pursuit of equality, does not have the machinery to deal with it. Jesus and the Buddha
3012080	3017440	are neither left nor right. Like, it doesn't make sense to talk, right? Yeah, exactly.
3017440	3024400	It doesn't make sense at all. Exactly. Right. And so the point is, in a very profound way,
3025040	3029520	it's not that they're non-political, but they're, if you'll allow me, they're metapolitical. Oh,
3029520	3035760	yeah. Right. They're trying to get at what, what are the values or the virtues people should be
3035760	3041040	aspiring to that are the most responsible, and I mean both senses of the word responsible,
3041040	3048320	to human nature, right? That's what I see them doing. And that's what I'm not seeing in this
3048320	3053840	movement. I'm not seeing the wisdom of, you know, like we said, of trying to balance these
3053840	3059120	things together of getting a deep understanding of human nature. I'm, I'm hearing a very, very
3059120	3067760	superficial theory about human nature and human history and human culture. And, and, and I don't
3067760	3074960	think that the version of justice, justice is, what really concerns me is this version of justice,
3075200	3080560	it sounds so easy. And, and that means, that to me means it's got to be wrong, because I mean,
3080560	3085120	what I get from all the great philosophers is justice, real justice. I mean, John Rawls writes
3085120	3091680	this huge book, right? Like real justice is hard. It's really hard because human beings
3091680	3096640	are so incredibly complex. And they have, as we've been talking about here, these, you know,
3096640	3104080	these opposing forces and polls at work in them. That was a point I was trying to make, sorry.
3104080	3108800	You're totally right. And I think that, like, if you look at this, if you look at how Christ deals
3108800	3114480	with it, it's interesting, because, you know, we talked about responsibility. And you can see that
3114480	3118320	in, you can see the way that Christ talks about, like he talks to the Pharisees, and he says you're
3118320	3123680	a bunch of hypocrites. And he, he talks to woe to the rich, if you don't care for the poor,
3124240	3129600	and woe to, you know, and blessed are those who are poor for they will receive and all of this,
3129600	3135120	like there's all this and this, but he also has several parables where he talks about the poor,
3135120	3140160	who don't care for what they have, and the consequences of that. Like he also has that he
3140160	3145120	also has the parable of the talents where he talks about the servant who receives something and doesn't
3145120	3150800	make it fruitful and therefore has to face the consequences of not making fruitful that's what
3150800	3156000	she has. And so Christ talks of talks at all levels at the same time. You know, I always say, like
3156000	3161760	you said, he's metapolitical. He's a judge and a victim. He's the king and the servant. He's all
3161760	3167360	these things at the same time, in a very paradoxal way. And so he kind of transcends politics. And
3167360	3172960	it's interesting to watch politicians, the politically minded, because they see in Christ
3172960	3178720	a kind of weird mirror of themselves. So the people on the left see Christ as a kind of revolutionary
3179920	3185520	figure. And the people on the right see Christ as a get your act together type figure. And it's like,
3185520	3190480	well, you know what, there's neither of those really. Yeah, I think that was very well said,
3190480	3199680	Jonathan. So what to do with this, what to do with this, this weird, the way that I think the way
3199680	3204320	to understand it, and you know, you talked a little bit in our before our conversation started
3204320	3209280	about the inevitability of religio. And I think that's really the way that's exactly where I
3209280	3215440	wanted to go. This whole discussion seems to be pointing, right? It's making a very, I think,
3215440	3221840	plausible argument about the inevitability of religio, the unavoidability of religio in
3221840	3227760	human endeavor. And you made, and human existence, and you made this point, and I wanted to give
3227760	3233920	you the opportunity to expand on it. You made a point of criticizing the new atheists, you know,
3234720	3239920	in how they were sort of saying, if we could just get rid of religion, you know, and what they did
3239920	3246000	is, you know, they identified religion with a, you know, belief in the supernatural, etc, etc.
3246000	3251120	And if we just got rid of those false beliefs, then that would be it. And then your point is, well,
3251120	3255280	the people that are in these marches, they're not advocating anything necessarily supernatural,
3255280	3259280	something perhaps transcendent, but not supernatural, etc. They're not doing all,
3259280	3264320	but nevertheless, look at the religious behavior, look at how comprehensive and powerful it is,
3264320	3269520	and look at how much it's a response to the way the COVID crisis accelerated the meaning crisis.
3270640	3275040	And you made that, and it was sort of a very brief thing. It was about two or three minutes in the
3275040	3279200	video, but I wanted to give you, and I think this is a good context, you and I, in discussion,
3279200	3285360	I wanted to give you the opportunity to expand on that. Yeah. Well, my criticism of the new
3285360	3289920	atheists, you know, and I would use Stephen Pinker as the, as the main example, just because of
3289920	3292960	the kinds of books he've written and the kind of statements he's made about
3292960	3297280	enlightenment and this kind of progress and everything, is that,
3299440	3303520	and I think that what you're doing is, is a much better, like the COGSI approach and the
3303520	3308960	cognitive science approach is a much better approach to this, because there is, there is
3308960	3314880	an understanding of what a human being is in a, in a deeper way. And, and there's an understanding
3314880	3320160	of the reasons why we have certain patterns and the reason why certain things exist within us.
3320160	3326560	And what, what the new atheist team to want to do is to see the advantage of reason,
3327200	3332720	and then want to kind of box the human being in reason, and see everything which is outside of
3332720	3338080	reason as the thing to get rid of, as the bad thing to get rid of. There's our original sin,
3338080	3342640	is everything that's outside of reason needs to be eliminated. But the problem is that you
3342640	3348160	can't eliminate it. You know, and, and there's a kind of weird utopian vision, and the example I
3348160	3355040	always use is the example of sleep. You could say, and reason and, and, and awakenness, you know,
3355040	3359440	and the idea of kind of this more, this other aspect of us in sleep, it's a good way to understand
3359440	3365280	it. It's as if I told you, you could be way more productive, if you didn't sleep. Like you just
3365280	3368800	have to not sleep, and then you could be awake all the time. And wouldn't that be amazing? Like
3368800	3372400	then you would imagine how much progress you would make, like imagine how far you would go,
3372400	3377920	if you would just stay awake all the time. But the reality is that you can't. That's not just,
3377920	3384000	not part of being a human being. And so these other patterns that we have are there. And so,
3384000	3389120	and they're extremely important. And if you try to get rid of them, what they do is they kind of,
3389120	3393840	they go down for a little while, and then they come back like a monster, and then we'll swallow
3393840	3399120	you. And that's what we're, those are the kinds of things we saw in the, in the French Revolution,
3399120	3406000	in the Russian Revolution, all the kind of end of atheist cycle where all of a sudden the patterns
3406000	3411280	come back like a big monster to devour you. And now we're seeing very similar things as well.
3411280	3418400	We're seeing a secular religious manifestation. And it's akin to the one we saw in the French
3418400	3423760	Revolution. And it's akin to the one we saw in the Russian Revolution. And so, and I always want
3423760	3430000	to say, it's like the people who kind of made fun of Jordan Peterson talking about this, it's like,
3430000	3435360	it's happening right now. It's happening right now. Look at what's going on. And you can just
3435360	3441360	poo poo it. You can toss it to the side, but it's the same pattern happening again. And the reason
3441360	3449440	for the pattern is the same, like the denial of, sorry, I get excited and I throw myself.
3450320	3457840	Me too, me too. The denial of certain aspects of the human person is going to come back.
3457840	3464240	And so the idea is what do you do? Like how do you deal with it? And to me, that's why I think that
3465520	3471920	that's why I think that having a conscious religious aspect to you, that's why ritual,
3472720	3481120	conscious ritual is important because ritual will be there. You can't avoid it. Now the question is
3481120	3487120	whether or not it's part of you integrated or whether or not you're a slave to ritualized behavior
3487120	3493360	and kind of scapegoat and identity forming behavior that is just part of existence.
3494320	3500240	I think that was very beautifully said. Yeah, I agree. I think on the first point you made,
3500320	3504800	but the COGSI and all the stuff on relevance realization and those aspects that are
3504800	3512160	pre-rational and how primordial they are and the importance of ritual. So for those of you,
3512160	3516000	I mean, you're watching this video, you know this work. And so there's arguments there and
3516000	3519680	thank you, Jonathan, for gesturing to them. And then as you were building on that,
3520560	3524400	I thought of this scene and you'll probably be able to riff on this because it's a mythology,
3524400	3528480	it's from a science fiction classic, you know, Journey to the Center of the Earth.
3529040	3533040	And especially in the movie version, Count Sacknessen, who's the villain,
3535040	3538960	you'll see how this connects in just a sec. They come to him and they say, well,
3539920	3545200	don't you sleep? And he said, I never sleep. I hate those little slices of death. And he
3545200	3550320	represents exact, no, just, right, so the journey to the center of the earth, which of course has
3550320	3556560	all kinds of mythic, you know, meanings attached to that, right? But he's the villain. And notice
3556560	3562080	how he brings together like your analogy and how it connects back to an unwillingness to accept his
3562080	3569760	humanness, his mortality, the hubris in here. And that cycles us back again to this refusal to accept
3569760	3577280	our humanity. It's ultimately, it's again the same kind of, it's a puritanical kind of refusal
3577280	3587600	to accept our humanity in a profound hubristic way. And that, and that I think is what, when I've
3587600	3593760	talked to people, you know, who have sort of come out of the New Atheist movement,
3595360	3601440	one of the things that they'll often say that started putting them off was they got a sense of
3601440	3610800	arrogance attached to these people. And, you know, and I'm not talking about, and part of it is no
3610800	3616320	doubt personality. There's narcissism and, but I think they might also have been putting out their
3616320	3627840	finger on this, this sense that, right, there are aspects of our humanity that are not being given
3627840	3633120	due. And this is what I mean again about justice, soffers and justice. Plato had this sense that
3633120	3639680	you had to give all of the parts of the human their due. They had to be given their due regard,
3639680	3648320	their due role, their due place. The attempt to eradicate was a deep mistake, right? And,
3648320	3654720	and, right. And so this, this, the soffers and the inner justices, we have to give due regard
3654720	3662400	and due place and due role for all aspects of our humanity. If you look at, if you look at the very
3662400	3668560	first commandment or the very first place in scripture where it talks about something which is
3668560	3675840	holy is in the description of creation. And so you have six days, then you have the seventh day,
3675840	3681200	which is the day of rest. And it's the day which is set aside for God, right? It's the holy day.
3681200	3686960	And, and right there in Genesis, it says that's why we, we follow the Sabbath. Now that there's a
3686960	3693200	mystery in that, which is very profound. And the mystery is that it's exactly the mystery that the
3693200	3699360	New Atheists are impotent and capable of seeing, which is that the way that the world is made and
3699360	3704480	the way that consciousness is made and the way that reason is made is because it's a patterning
3704480	3711680	system. It can never encompass everything, right? It, it can be coherent, but it cannot be complete.
3712320	3721280	And you need to leave a bit out for completeness to manifest itself, like in its, in its mystery.
3721920	3728800	So you need to leave a bit on the edge that is not closed, that isn't tied up, that isn't
3728800	3733760	accounted for. There has to be some aspects which are not accounted for. If you try to
3733840	3740960	account for everything, that's the, you know, that's the, that's the, the most dangerous thing,
3740960	3746720	right? It's the, and if you also try to see that which is accounted for as totality,
3746720	3752480	which is the sin of Satan, which is the sin of pride, which is the sin of Adam, that's the hubris.
3752480	3758640	And then, then you fall because that aspect which you, which you, which you, which is supposed to
3758640	3766400	be unaccounted for, which you're trying to ignore is still there, right? And, and the, the fascinating
3766400	3773600	aspect of that margin or the, the, let's say the seventh day is that there are, it has two parts
3773600	3783280	to it. It has a part which is the, the unfathomable of creation, right? The, the, the completeness of
3783280	3789840	creation, but it also points to the infinite. There's a secrecy in it, which also points to the
3789840	3796160	infinite, which is why it's both the day of rest, but also the day set aside for God at the same time.
3796160	3799680	So it's both death and the source of life at the same time.
3801200	3805360	That's very interesting. Your invocation of Godel, I mean, I take Godel's theorem that you
3805360	3811920	can't have a both complete and consistent to be an example of what I meant earlier by mortality.
3811920	3817440	That's the mortality in the heart of any epistemological project or, you know, Heisenberg's
3817440	3823120	uncertainty. That's the mortality in the, in the, in the heart of any empirical observation or
3823120	3830640	investigation and, and more and more of these, right? And the, the, the, the history and philosophy
3830640	3834880	of the last two centuries have been in philosophy of science, at least the more philosophical aspects
3834880	3839840	of science have been the, been the discovery of this. I'd like your invocation of it because
3839840	3843760	it brings me back around and, you know, and you, I, you, you may, I don't know if you're doing
3843760	3848800	it deliver it a little off, but you're invoking, I heard Levinas when you were comparing totality
3848800	3852800	to infinity because he has a book around that, right? And how infinity is not the same thing as
3852800	3857520	totality. Because totality is the pretense that you have both consistency and completeness.
3857520	3862560	That's my way of understanding it. And, and therefore it, like, if you take the Goli, Goli,
3863200	3869760	Goli's argument seriously, and you should, right, that is always a dangerous pretense.
3869760	3877200	And that the problem with any, any system that claims to be complete and consistent is that it
3877200	3886480	is actually a deep form of self deception. Oh yeah. That's for sure. So I mean, and this is what,
3886480	3890880	you know, this was, this is the great for all of the criticisms I have of them. This is the great
3890880	3896160	thing that comes out of the whole pragmatism movement of James and Pierce and Dewey and more
3896160	3901440	recent people, you know, like Quine and Davidson. And they've had a deep influence on me. I haven't
3901440	3905600	had a chance to talk about them very much. I will in another series. But the point I'm trying to get
3905600	3912960	to here is, like, there's a, there's a shadow side of the utilitarianism. There's a negative version
3912960	3918800	of it, which is strategies of eradication, because eradication is an attempt to be completely
3918800	3924240	consistent and complete. So there's an argument, and I'm not advocating for all of his ideas,
3924240	3928880	but I just want to give due credit. Coleman Hughes makes this argument about, look,
3929840	3934800	we all agree that murder is a deeply immoral act. And I'm not playing around with terms. Well,
3934800	3939280	sometimes you kill, but when we say killing that's not immoral, we don't call it murder. Murder is
3939280	3944000	the name for the killing we regard as immoral. So let's not play that game. So we guard murder as
3944000	3950320	immoral, but we don't pursue an eradication strategy in our society. Because if we were to
3950320	3958560	eradicate, try to eradicate murder, we would so, we would so subject ourselves to a radically
3958560	3967200	dehumanizing totalitarian state that, and that's why no culture anyway doesn't, right? Every culture
3967200	3972560	has prohibitions against murder. There's variations on it, of course, but you don't see them saying,
3972560	3975920	and what we're going to do is we're going to set things up so that murder is impossible.
3975920	3978320	You know, Philip, that's a Philip K. Dick kind of situation.
3978320	3982800	Oh yeah, it's a scary thing. No, and you're right about the strategies of eradication.
3984000	3991200	These are extremely frightening because they tend towards exactly what you're talking about.
3991200	3996400	And I'm afraid that I see the same, you know, and I'm afraid that I'm seeing that right now
3996400	4003440	with COVID. I'm seeing exactly a falling into a strategy of eradication where we think that we
4003440	4014080	cannot continue to live until this virus ceases to exist. This is not how it works. This is a
4014080	4019520	dangerous because the method you will use to eradicate the virus, the totalitarian method
4019520	4026480	you will use will be extremely harmful. They will be very, very harmful to our health,
4026480	4031440	to our community, all of these things. And it's like the difficulty that you understand
4031440	4036960	the desire to eradicate because it's a bad thing, right? This virus is a bad thing. You want it to
4036960	4042960	go away, but once you enter into that strategy of eradication, especially with techno states,
4042960	4051280	where you are develop the power to push that capacity of eradication to limit that we're
4051280	4058240	not seen before, it's a very, very frightening situation. A clear example of that is the proposal
4058240	4065120	that we start tracking everybody's movement, every movement. I say people, do you really want the
4065120	4070480	state to have that power? Do you really want the state to have that power? Do you really want the
4070480	4075280	corporations to have that power? They already have that power to some degree and they use it to
4075280	4083600	manipulate you. Look, I can't believe it. I saw a BBC article just a few days ago and it was just
4083600	4087760	like a regular article where they're talking about what the future of travel will look like.
4087760	4095120	And in their description of the future of travel, they talked about vaccines with identification
4095120	4101520	in the vaccine that they can scan your body so that you, and this was a BBC article. It wasn't
4101520	4105840	a conspiracy article. It wasn't like someone, it was like, this is what travel is going to look
4105840	4111520	like. They'll scan your body to know whether or not you have the vaccine and they'll let you
4111520	4118640	participate in social things depending on whether or not they can track you. It's like, my goodness,
4119920	4123440	don't you watch science fiction movies? I don't know. Am I the only one who watch
4123440	4130320	science fiction movies? Well, I watch them too. So, I mean, and we have to be careful here. So,
4130320	4136880	COVID is very bad. Oh, yeah. No, no, no, I want to make an analogy here. COVID is very bad and you
4136880	4143200	should try as much as we can ameliorate it, but with wisdom, toggling against over empowering the
4143200	4149680	state and taking a dehumanized view or a simplistic view of human nature in order to
4149680	4155360	achieve it. So, we don't push for eradication. We push for amelioration that doesn't cost us too
4155360	4162160	much our humanity. Isn't that the same attitude we should take for how to deal with the very
4162160	4169360	real evil of racism that we should try which, and we should continue to try to ameliorate it?
4169360	4174640	But we shouldn't, you know, I talk a lot about how you frame the problem. It is way more important
4174960	4182240	the method about actually solving it. Should we be adopting a mindset that is a totalitarian
4182240	4188720	kind of eradication about something like racism? It strikes me that argument by analogy means
4188720	4195600	there is a sense in which we can go too far on this. And that doesn't, I hope, that doesn't make
4195600	4200960	me a racist. And what I've seen is I saw the interview with Don Lemon and I forget the name
4200960	4207520	of the actor and he was trying to say, he's a black guy. And he's trying to say, I'm just saying
4207520	4213920	that some of the leaders of the movement are going too far to extreme. That's all he was proposing
4213920	4221680	and he was treated with smugness and dismiss and then this horrible argument by Lemon.
4222320	4227680	Well, people accuse Martin Luther King of being too extreme as if, well, are you saying that
4227680	4232240	because sometimes people have misused that word that every time they use it, they're misusing it?
4232240	4238080	That's a really stupid argument. Can we have a better argument, please? And it's like, if we
4238080	4246000	can't even bring up the question that we might be framing the attempt to achieve a goal, a lot of
4246000	4251200	a goal that I fully support, then I think we're in a very, very bad place. I think we're getting
4251200	4258080	into a very bad place. Yeah. And you're right. Because one of the things COVID did was awaken
4258080	4267680	in us this pattern of infection. And it awakened in us the pattern of infection and the desire
4267680	4275760	to exclude and eradicate. And now it's being politicized. Not the COVID. It's weird because
4275760	4284080	you can see that there's no narrative connection between COVID and Floyd, but there is a pattern
4284080	4289920	connection. And you can see that it's awakened the pattern and now it's playing out in the political
4289920	4295200	sphere. Well, I mean, isn't that a case? Again, I'm talking at the latent level, not at the
4295200	4300880	manifest label, but that seems like a case, a clear case of what a psychodynamic person would
4300880	4307840	call displacement. COVID puts you like you're suddenly in the Old Testament. I don't mean
4307840	4312240	that pejoratively. But you have this ubiquitous, threatening things out there in the world,
4312240	4318720	and you have to adopt this very insular purity code. And then you don't know when it's going
4318720	4330320	to strike you. And then it might be infected. But now what we can do is we couldn't do anything
4330320	4334480	about the COVID, but I think what your suggestion is, but I can do something about this over here.
4334480	4341680	Can do something about, yeah. And the danger of the racist thing is the limit of it, because the
4341680	4348000	limit is the problem with racism is that it's this invisible thing in the sense that it ends up being
4348000	4354480	thoughts and feelings in people. And the idea that you can reprogram someone and that you can
4355120	4359680	move towards the eradication of thoughts and feelings. I mean, we know where that leads,
4359680	4364640	like we know where that goes. And because it can't happen, then like we said, like I said before,
4364640	4369120	but it's going to end up looking like a scapegoating, where we're going to choose some,
4369120	4375200	we're going to find examples that we can drag out in public and, you know, and have struggle
4375200	4380560	sessions, watch struggle sessions and have them be humiliated in public so that we can deal with
4380560	4387520	the problem of eradicating something which is, which is unconscious bias. Like it's unconscious.
4387520	4395680	So you can't, how can you eradicate it? Well, I think trying to eradicate that is,
4397200	4401680	I mean, given what we've argued, isn't that the same? It's ultimately committing you at some
4401680	4407280	level to eradicating the machinery of humanity. That's right. Right. And so,
4408240	4416000	let's say that this is, I've been more and more attracted to René Girard in the past year, I
4416000	4420480	would say, you know, just because of everything that's happened. And I've been seeing that his
4420480	4427760	analysis of the situation is really one of the wisest in terms of the way that he interpreted
4427760	4433440	what's happening and intersectionality. I mean, he passed away, I think around 2010 or maybe a bit
4433440	4440160	later. You know, he talked about, I saw a quote of his in 2007 where he talked about the machine of
4440160	4446720	Antichrist, which is ramping up. And he saw exactly what we're seeing. He said, it'll be infinite
4446720	4452960	victimhood looking for infinite scapegoat. And so it's like this perpetual wheel of victimhood,
4452960	4458240	which is looking perpetually for more and more scapegoats, like almost like a self-devouring
4458240	4465840	machine. And so we're seeing it. The solution is, like I hate to, I know you dislike when I
4465840	4474320	push it too far, but the solution is the image of the scapegoat being the murderer and this,
4474320	4479840	and the victim at the same time, right? Identifying with Christ and identifying with those that killed
4479840	4487600	him. Identifying with the capacity to exclude and the reality of also being excluded to a certain
4487600	4493520	extent. Like those two things together, if you can kind of, you can integrate them properly and not
4493520	4499600	in a weird disorderly manner, can help you have compassion for those who are excluded, but can
4499600	4504960	help you also understand that you are one of those who do that all the time. You're always doing it.
4505760	4511840	But this is what I meant. I think there's power under argument. I've only read the one book and
4511920	4517520	I'm not completely at the one I saw on Satan Fall like lightning. But the idea that you can
4517520	4522800	explode, if you'll allow me to use some of my terms, you can explode the cultural cognitive grammar
4522800	4527680	of scapegoating and that the Christian mythos does that. I thought that was one of the most
4527680	4533040	powerful arguments. And it's a new argument, as far as I know, one of the most powerful
4533680	4538000	apologetic arguments for Christianity that I had heard in quite some time. So I think that
4538000	4545680	is a good point that you brought up. But I think it's situated within this larger past again,
4545680	4551600	which we can keep coming back to, of trying to get to a place where we can simultaneously accept
4551600	4561280	faith and virtue. Because one of the ways in which you can address people's thoughts and feelings
4561360	4569600	is by inspiring them to aspire to virtue. Rather than trying to eradicate, you can try to inspire
4569600	4577040	the aspiration to virtue. And this has been, to my mind, a very, very successful strategy,
4578160	4582960	where I've been talking a lot recently, and Akira the Don did the meaning wave about it,
4582960	4587520	about stealing the culture. And I actually use Christianity as a primary example of that,
4587520	4593120	that Christianity doesn't try and overthrow the political structure. What it does is it steals
4593120	4598400	the culture. It creates an entirely different culture from the bottom up. And then, because
4598960	4604560	the problem, to my mind, what the French Revolution shows is you can radically transform the state,
4604560	4609280	but if you don't transform the underlying cultural, cognitive, grammar, and normativity,
4609280	4616160	nothing is fundamentally going to change. Yeah, you just changed the ones who are holding the
4616560	4625200	reins. You circulate the elites. Exactly. Whereas what Christianity does is it builds a new
4625200	4630560	civilization. Buddhism does the same thing. It builds a new civilization. Islam does the same
4630560	4638320	thing. It builds a new civilization. And so that brings us, and we don't have much time, I suppose,
4638320	4644240	but that brings me towards the third point. You said, you sort of despair of knowing what to do.
4644480	4654240	And I'm wondering if you, I'm sorry, I realized I might be daring the pro-Hasturist thing with
4654240	4659440	proposing some sort of a Christian thing to a Christian, which is a ridiculous thing.
4661280	4667840	But I gave you all of those examples. And to my mind of the idea of, well, isn't the response to
4667840	4675440	do as much as we can to engage in building the next culture? And that sounds preposterous,
4675440	4681760	but a commitment to that kind of thing seems to me to be the most responsible response
4681760	4689760	to the depth of the situation we are in right now. Yeah. No, I think so. I would say on a
4689760	4697360	personal level, love God, love your neighbor is a pretty good thing to live by in the immediate
4697360	4703280	reality and not abstract categories to deal, you know, to love the people that you encounter with,
4703280	4708960	to see in them the face of God is something that will transform at least your life. It's harder
4708960	4716080	in terms of like a social responsibility. For sure, myself, the way that I frame it,
4717200	4723280	that's why I'm doing what I'm doing. What you said is that I'm trying to help people see the
4723280	4729200	grammar of culture or see the pattern. And of course, one of the things I've been emphasizing
4729200	4734160	the most is the importance of the margin and talking about the margin in a balanced way so
4734160	4740320	that you neither have the desire to, because both sides want to eliminate the margin. Everybody
4740320	4745920	wants to eliminate it. They want to eliminate the margin either by making it the same as the center,
4745920	4750720	by integrating all the marginal aspects and making them equal to everything else,
4750720	4756800	or by eradication or by cutting it off. And that's the real problem with the,
4757760	4764160	it's the question we had during the first wave of violence of the 20th century. You had two sides.
4764160	4770000	You had one side which wanted to create an equal utopia and one which wanted to create
4770000	4776560	a hierarchical utopia that cut off the margin, that burned it off. And we're facing the same,
4776560	4781200	it's like we didn't deal with it. We're facing the same problem now. And we're seeing the one side
4781200	4788240	now, we're seeing the side that wants everything to be equal. But I always tell people that
4789920	4795200	when the Nazis came to Germany, they were on the verge of a communist revolution. The pendulum
4795200	4800880	doesn't move in one direction. The pendulum swings and it's a scary thing to watch.
4801840	4808800	But this is part of the way in which again, the way in which this lack of, the lack of
4810080	4816720	of a dynamical nuance in thinking. So, you know, Leo Ferraro and I talk about this idea that
4818400	4823680	in living systems and right, you see opponent processing. And I've argued, right, and that
4823680	4829520	what an opponent processing means, this is the way you deal with trade-offs. And we've been talking
4829520	4832960	about trade-offs all the way through, right? You have opponent processing, you like your
4832960	4837200	parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system. Like the sympathetic nervous system is biased.
4837200	4841120	It tries to interpret everything as a threat or an opportunity and it arouses you. And the
4841120	4844720	parasympathetic system is biased and it tries to interpret everything as a signal that you should
4844720	4849680	relax and calm down. And they're working, their biases work in opposite direction, but they're
4849680	4854000	functionally integrated together because that's how you get the most self-corrective system.
4854320	4860160	And what we're supposed to have, and you can see this in Dewey, right? Because we're supposed
4860160	4865760	to have a point processing, but what it's devolved into is adversarial processing.
4866880	4871920	And this is the eradication idea. Now it's a zero-sum game. I've given up the idea of
4871920	4876080	self-correction. I've given up the idea of commitment to a process that you and I, even
4876080	4881760	though we disagree, we can commit to. Like you and I do in dialogue. We have disagreements,
4881760	4886880	but we see the potential that we can correct each other in valuable ways that we mutually
4886880	4893440	appreciate. There was that commitment and that commitment to that process has been lost.
4894160	4900880	Like the fact that most Americans are more distrusting of the opposite party than they are
4900880	4906160	a foreign threat. Like what the heck does that mean? What does that mean to you?
4906720	4916320	And so the adversarial eradicate the other, destroy the other, zero-sum game mentality,
4916320	4923360	I think has made the process, I think, is broken. I think the process is broken.
4924400	4930480	And so I don't know. I don't see how, I mean, and Layman Pascal and others,
4930480	4934320	they disagree with me on this. I don't know how to work within that in a way.
4934560	4940000	And so that's what I mean by steal the culture, that I don't know if working within that machinery
4940000	4947120	is a viable strategy. I think no strategy has to be, you know, Jonathan, I was at a conference
4948000	4952960	two weeks ago called the Movement Summit. And there's all these communities of practice
4952960	4960160	springing up everywhere or trying to integrate mindfulness and movement practices and discourse
4960800	4967520	practices and so many of them. And, you know, these people, and they all want to talk to each
4967520	4975120	other and they want to network. And it felt very different. This is, it felt very, it was neither,
4975120	4981440	you know, the revolution of the left or the law and order of the right. It was orthogonal to that.
4981440	4988960	It was these people trying to seriously time and talent and money and energy and commitment
4988960	4996240	to the cultivation of wisdom and a deeply alternative way of being. And to my mind, that's
4996240	5001600	where, and I know you think it should be given a particular Christian splint, but I also think
5001600	5006640	you're charitable enough to include other people of good faith who are willing to work with you.
5006640	5012160	I think that's where the answer to the more difficult problem lies. I think there is stuff
5012160	5017280	actually happening right here, right now, culturally, symbolically, existentially,
5017280	5021440	that is where the difference that is needed is starting to be generated.
5022240	5028720	Oh, but I, for sure, agree. I think that the seeds of the, like a way to see it is like that
5029440	5035440	this is horrible because it has bad implications, but like the seeds of the next world will appear
5035440	5042080	in the current one, right? They're just hard to see, you know, the little sprouts are hard to see
5042080	5048560	because everything else is burning in the forest, right? So it's difficult to see the seeds as this
5048560	5054960	is kind of breaking apart. And I mean, I'm curious to see how all of this will be integrated. I do,
5056320	5060480	I do, again, like, you know, we've talked about this before. So we're not going to come to a
5060480	5069360	conclusion, but I do think that there is a need for a narrative cohesion. And I do think that until
5069920	5076240	until something happens in the West, it's still, it's still the Christian narrative. So I don't,
5076240	5081040	I don't see a way out of it for at least, you know, I don't see a way out of it. So, but I,
5081040	5086240	I appreciate, I do think that the questions that people are asking and that the desire for wisdom
5086240	5093520	and the desire for transformation is one which will bear fruit. It won't, it has to, if it's done
5093520	5097920	with sincerity and done, you know, in a desire for transformation, it will bear fruit.
5098400	5104160	Yeah. And the point I'm trying to make is thank you for saying that. And you know, from my part,
5104160	5110080	I don't, I don't ever claim to have a foreclosure argument against Christianity. I always say that
5110080	5116880	I do not have such a fit. But what I was trying to emphasize is there's not only sincerity,
5116880	5123600	there's depth in like what's going on here. It has the appreciation for humanity and complexity.
5124480	5128400	That's what I'm seeing in these people in this movement. Of course, we're all flawed human
5128400	5133280	beings. I'm not, I'm not painting some utopic vision, but I'm talking about, you know,
5134400	5141680	a real, a real possibility and the acknowledgement that I think it's, it's, it's, it's in existence.
5141680	5146480	I like your metaphor for all the ways it's fraught, but I do like your metaphor of the seeds. I do
5146480	5150240	like putting the two together, that the burning of the forest actually fertilizes the seeds in the
5150320	5154880	way they need to be fertilized. And perhaps you were alluding to that and your right smile.
5155280	5159680	Yeah, but it's not, it's not a fun. It's not fun. Like it's not pleasurable.
5159680	5166000	No, there's, and it means, it means death and suffering. Yep. And I have kids and I don't want
5166000	5173520	this, but I want and what needs to happen are not always the same thing. Yeah. Jonathan, I think
5173520	5181040	maybe this would be a good place to bring it to a close. So I proposed to you privately and you
5181040	5186160	already agreed. So I'm going to do it publicly. I think that you and I and Paul should have a,
5186880	5191600	have a discussion like this, the logos, as I would call it, at length for the three of us.
5191600	5196080	And I'd like to invite you and then I've also invited Paul and let's, let's try and work to
5196080	5201440	make it happen because I think it would be very beneficial for all of our respective listeners.
5201440	5205040	Yeah, that would be great. I would, I would love that. We, let's set it up.
5205040	5212160	Okay. So I'll reach out to Paul and I'll try and make it happen. So I found, well, you could see,
5212160	5217920	I got passionate, which means this was definitely, this is definitely the logos for me. I always say
5217920	5224320	that the difference between the logos and monologue is both people find themselves adduced. They find
5224320	5228640	themselves drawn to a place they couldn't get to individually on the road. And there's a kind
5228720	5232880	of education and then that that's very different from just sort of thinking in your own head.
5233680	5237840	And so I always find that the case when I get into such a dialogue with you,
5237840	5242960	and I wanted to thank you for it. You had so many, so many insightful, brilliant ways,
5245360	5249120	so many insights and brilliant things you said. And not only what you said, the manner in which
5249120	5254480	you said the imagery that you use was itself often deeply helpful. So thank you very much.
5254480	5258800	Thank you very, very much. Well, you know, I really, I always enjoy talking to you and I,
5258800	5262400	and I really appreciate the insight you're bringing to the conversation. And I'm
5262400	5267760	looking forward to seeing where this is going and kind of how, how this is slowly going to,
5269280	5272480	let's say play dance together is the best way to maybe to say it.
5272480	5277040	Yeah. Yeah. I agree. I agree. Okay. So thank you very much.
5277040	5278960	All right, John. It was good to talk to you.
5278960	5280800	Good talk to you. All right. Bye-bye.
5280800	5281440	Bye-bye.
