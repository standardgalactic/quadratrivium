0	6160	So hello, everybody. I am here with John Revekey. Many of you, most of you, everyone who's watching
6160	11200	this will have seen a video with me and John Revekey before. And also, John had a discussion
11200	17200	with Jordan Peterson a few months ago. And that discussion, in that discussion, many things came
17200	21680	up that were related to also John and I's discussion, and then Jordan and I's discussion.
22240	27600	And so Jordan, someone in the group had the idea of doing something with me. And then that added
27680	33520	Bishop Barron on top. And so a few weeks ago, we had a discussion with Bishop Barron, which is
33520	38800	going to be online. I'll link it to the description. Many of you may even have seen it. And it was a
38800	44880	very interesting discussion, one which at first kind of tried to find its way. And then suddenly,
44880	50160	we really felt like it just kind of took off. And many interesting things were said. So John and I
50160	55040	thought it would be a good idea to kind of dive back into the things that we talked about and
55120	57600	explore them even more. So John, thanks for coming.
69600	73200	This is Jonathan Peugeot. Welcome to the symbolic world.
73360	86560	It's a great pleasure, Jonathan. And it was my idea, by the way, to include you.
87840	93280	That's very kind of you. Well, no, because, well, friendship was part of it. But the other part
93280	98880	of it was you were very much a ghostly presence in the conversation I had with Jordan. And I felt
98960	104160	it was unfair, ultimately, to not allow you to actually be present and be involved. So that's
104160	108800	why I suggested it to Jordan. And it's interesting because with adding Bishop Barron, the conversation
108800	114400	definitely morphed into something completely different. Yeah, because he's not involved in
114400	119040	this kind of inner, the way that we've been talking about religion, let's say, for the past several
119040	125520	years, you and I and Jordan in our different ways, but kind of coming towards similar ideas about
125520	131280	phenomenology or in your sense, more kind of coccy and Jordan's evolutionary approach, all of
131280	136480	this is kind of coming towards something. And Bishop Barron is dropping out from outside with
136480	141520	a more kind of Catholic, Thomas and Augustinian way of thinking. So for me, that was one of the
141520	146960	most interesting things was to watch the discussion move towards the direction where all of a sudden
146960	152000	I could see in Bishop Barron's eyes that he was like, oh, this is like there's something else going
152000	158560	on here. There's another type of discussion. Yeah, he just wrote, I just read it this morning. I
158560	166320	didn't read it thoroughly. I just read parts of it. He wrote a blog about and yeah, he was very
166320	174320	clearly appreciative in all three senses of the word of the discussion. And so I think your
174320	181520	observation is accurate. And so I think that this is, to me, it was exciting because I think that
181520	187440	the discussion we're having and bringing it back to the human experience in a way that a lot of
187440	192000	the arguments that have been going on in the past few hundred years, a lot of them have been arguing
192000	196720	religion from a sociological perspective or from a scientific perspective, even which is that was
196720	201760	always the worst, the worst one, but a lot of it from kind of a more philosophical, metaphysical
201760	207040	perspective. But the way that we're trying to bring, come towards it, although it does include
207040	212480	metaphysics and sociology and all of that, it brings it back to this just the way that we
212480	220480	experience the world and how it's coherent with those experiences. Yeah, I think that's right.
222720	226640	And part of what we're doing is trying to articulate and explicate and elucidate the
226640	230960	relationship between these things. So what I'm going to say isn't going to be terribly clear,
230960	238240	but not only is there a convergence between us, and I share that with you, by the way,
238240	243200	that sense, and I'm appreciative of it. I think there's this convergence around
243200	249840	things, these topics of meaning and wisdom and transformation and connectedness
251680	259680	and the central roles of intelligence in an ancient sense and the tension, the way they're
260400	263280	that's what I want to say, the way intelligence and attention are bound up together.
264480	270400	All of these things are coming together, I think, in a very powerful way. And I think
272240	279600	that convergence between us and between those terms and concepts and topics is also resonant.
279600	285680	It's not identical, but it's deeply analogous to some of the convergence I see happening in
285680	290560	sort of the broader culture, at least aspects of it, or what Seville King calls this corner of
290560	295760	the Internet. It's getting to be a pretty big corner, but yeah, I appreciate that.
296320	300080	Yeah, it's interesting because this corner of the Internet also, it has its different branches
300080	306400	and different emphases, but it definitely is this kind of convergence. I would say the way
306400	312080	that I see it is also an exciting opening, you could say it's like that. There's an exciting
312080	319200	opening where things that people before couldn't understand or didn't understand, all of a sudden
319200	326160	they're starting to get a sense of what it's about. The basic idea that religion was superstitious,
326160	334400	that religion is silly, that it's just added on to our experience was the common understanding,
334400	337920	not for everyone, but it was like a common understanding that was floating around in
337920	343840	culture, but now that seems to be breaking down and people are excited to now be able to understand
344400	347280	things that before just didn't make any sense to them at all.
348400	355840	Yeah, I agree with that very much. I mean, I think there's a bifurcation. I think that that's
355840	365200	happening. Way before COVID, even before I did Awakening for the Meaning Crisis, I was reading
365200	370640	about people talking about the religious turn within phenomenology, that that was a broad movement
370640	378640	happening. Then I saw within the emergence of 4e cognitive science that these themes that were
378640	384560	previously considered woo-woo, mindfulness and mystical experience and wisdom and meaning
384560	390400	and transformation and even the sense of the sacred, these are now coming into, these are
390400	395680	legitimate topics again and it's been a very rapid increase. On the other hand, I also see
396720	405040	the ramping up of the machinery of distraction in our culture and the machinery of surrogacy
405040	414000	where we're going to replace the real pursuit of meaning and wisdom with surrogates, some rather
414720	422320	innocuous and others really, really toxic. I see that, both of those happening and that's not
422320	428240	a contradiction. I think they're both happening for the same reason. Yeah, that makes a lot of
428240	436560	sense that there's a zeitgeist that's pulling things, pulling apart the ancient, the modern
436560	443040	world who's pulling it apart and now people lost in there. The phenomena that is bringing us
443040	449680	this new understanding of religion is the same phenomena that brings about viral videos on YouTube.
450960	455920	All of a sudden realizing how much attention is part of the way the world manifests itself,
455920	461280	but in that version, the viral video on YouTube is really the broken down version of it where
461280	465840	all of a sudden things pop up, take up all the attention and then vanish and then pop up,
465840	472800	take up all the attention and then vanish, this super rapid cycle of attention. But like you
472800	479600	said, if you take those two phenomena together, it points us to people understanding or becoming
479600	488720	more aware of attention, the problem and the opportunities of attention. Yeah, I think this
488720	493600	is consonant with what you're saying. It's a case of one group of people and I'm not trying to do an
493600	501280	us them thing. I'm just trying to write the people who are becoming aware of the centrality of
501360	508240	attention and what I call relevance realization and connectedness and the human need for both
508240	513760	grounding and self-transcendence and both individuation and participation in the community,
513760	519040	all of that and COVID I think highlighted all these themes. But then there's people who are not
519040	526320	so much aware of it, but embodying it almost like in a psychoanalytic sense, they're acting it out
526320	532080	the importance of attention and salience and relevance. But they're acting it out in a way
532080	538800	that's generally not fruitful for their own flourishing or the flourishing of the people
538800	544880	that they're living with or living in connection with. Exactly, also because the internet has
544880	553200	afforded a space where the relationship between attention and power has been increased thousands
553200	561280	of times and so all of a sudden people understanding that how attention can be a weapon and attention
561280	567600	can be a way to dominate and can be a way to seduce and can be all these things are kind of
567600	573760	coming up to the four, but instead of in a little village where you realize that you can do things
573760	581360	to manipulate others or to kind of... Now you have 100,000 people, 100,000 people under you
581360	588720	that can act as your body to act out in the world and yeah, we see the results of that.
589440	597120	Yeah, the internet's kind of like Tolkien's The One Ring. It's just this magnifier in some
597120	603840	fashion and it can magnify, for the Hobbits, it magnifies their sort of diminutive sneakiness
603840	609280	and they can become invisible, but for Sauron it magnifies his cruelty and his might. So yeah,
609280	617280	I think the internet is very much like The One Ring in that fashion and maybe that myth
617280	625840	coming to mind isn't totally just ephemeral. I mean, part of it is we are not doing one of the
625840	631520	strongest recommendations of that whole fantasy series is to step back and really reflect and
631520	638800	think about what's our relationship to The One Ring and should we be picking it up and
638800	645360	should we be more wary of it and things like that. And I do worry that we are running this
645360	651680	grand social experiment with social media and with phones on ourselves and the next generation.
651680	655840	There's already some preliminary evidence that's having an impact and we don't know what this is
655840	660640	going to do. We're doing something that is 10 times more powerful than the printing press
660640	666400	and the printing press unleashed forces that then turned to bloody religious war in an
666400	672560	unforeseen fashion. And so I do not think we are exercising proper care around this.
673440	678960	That's for sure. Nobody gets too big. It is like, you know, when we talk about,
679920	684160	this is when I look at the internet and I look at social media, it's the closest thing I have to
684160	689920	understanding a kind of, how can I say this, a God acting in the world in the sense that
689920	698480	like a pagan deity that is embodied in ritual and in practice and in nodes of attention because
698480	704240	it's just, there's no one controlling it. But it still seems to have a will and seems to be going
704240	709680	towards a telos and everybody sees it and nobody can stop it. And everybody says, well, at least
709680	714960	I'm going to get what I can get as I watch this God kind of move towards its sacrifice or whatever
714960	718640	is going on. But everybody's like, well, at least I can get something out of it while it's happening.
719440	727440	I think that's a very apropos way of thinking of it. I often use Thomas Merton's idea of a hyper
727440	738640	object. And Morton, Thomas Morton, I misspoke. Yeah, I was surprised that you would have a term
738640	746960	like that. And so Morton's idea in hyper objects is that there are things like,
747920	756320	the internet, global warming, evolution, their realities, but they're not bodies.
756320	763840	They're not spatially temporarily located. They're distributed. And we can't actually
763840	768560	sort of conceive of them. We can have terms referring to them, but we can't sort of,
768560	772800	if you allow me the science fiction reference, we can't grok them. We can't sort of really get.
773680	781520	And so we, but they're not abstract things over there, right? They're insinuating themselves
781520	788560	into the very fiber of our being. Yeah, they have more subtle bodies to use or they disturb.
788560	795200	Yeah. And I'm fine with that. And you see a similar kind of move in later Neoplatonism.
795200	798400	We can wear Proclus and the elements of theology and he's trying to work out
798400	804240	all of these principalities and powers and principles. And I think the relationship
804880	810960	that a lot of people have to the internet is properly understood as a religious relationship.
810960	816560	I mean, the internet serves as an oracle. Think about that. I mean, think about the devotion
816560	823360	people, they want to live in its world. And like you said, they have a sense of it having a life
823360	828400	and power of their own that people want to be in service to, but they also want to appropriate
828400	832800	that power. It's very much, it's almost like, you know, bald or something from the Old Testament
833440	839520	in that fashion. And so I think that's again, just to circle it back, I think that's again,
840160	845120	right? The reason why these things are coming together and you talk about this better than I
845120	850160	do, right? It is, right? The, what we're talking about, but the internet and what we're talking
850160	858560	about about this, this meaning wisdom movement about religion, those again, they might seem
858560	864000	like opposites or in opposition, but there's a deep underlying common ground that they're both
864000	870720	pointing to again, right? This phenomena, I don't think it's a coincidence that the internet and,
870720	878080	you know, the shared universes of Marvel and all of this are also occurring at the same time as
878080	882800	this return to an understanding of the depth and importance of religion. I think those are
882800	889520	completely, they belong together in terms of a unified explanation. Yeah. There's an interesting
889520	894240	thing that I've been realizing recently is that one of the, one of the aspects that seems to have
894240	899600	happened in Christianity, but probably has happened in Buddhism as well, because it seems similar,
899600	906880	is then the understanding that ultimately the sacrifice is a sacrifice of, we say a sacrifice
906880	911120	of worship. That's how the Christians were presented. Like when we go to Vespers service,
911120	915120	we talk about the evening sacrifice, and it's a sacrifice of worship. And it's to actually
915120	920800	understand that sacrifices is attention. That's what sacrifices, right? And so it's this,
921520	926560	the way that you attend, when you attend, you kind of give your attention to the thing that
926560	931840	you're attending to. And at the same time, you're also sacrificing the things next to them, right?
931840	937920	You're focusing. Yes. Yes. Yes. And so, and that seems to be something which with the internet is
937920	945120	now accelerating so much that it's almost impossible not to notice that that's what it is, that the
945120	952240	internet is like a, is like a monster, or is a being that lives through attention, that requires
952240	957120	our attention to exist. Like Neil Gaiman, I don't know if you know a little bit about Neil Gaiman,
957200	962640	he has, he wrote a lot about that. Like in some of his series, even in American gods, he had this
962640	967360	idea that these gods exist through attention. And if you don't give them attention, then they
967360	972480	weaken. If you give them attention, then they become stronger. And for all my criticism, Neil
972480	977600	Gaiman, that's a really powerful understanding. And I think one that is actually very Christian,
977600	982160	like that we really do have this idea that, you know, as we move away from the physical
982240	987680	sacrificial system in ancient times, we move toward the world where we understand sacrifice as
987680	995040	attention itself. I think that's, I think that is so consonant with the model that's emerging
996480	1003840	by Wall and others who are the cog side of attention. We're moving from a rather simple
1003840	1010480	model of attention as a filter to that what was actually happening in attention is prioritization.
1011040	1017360	So that the function of attention is to prioritize. And so, and that means,
1018160	1025520	I think quite correctly, like you said, that good attention is proper prioritization,
1025520	1029440	if you think of it that way, that you're prioritizing the things that should be given priority.
1030000	1037760	And I don't know if this is adequate, and I'm not claiming it is, but I can see why notions
1037840	1043920	of worship and sacrifice are bound up together. There's two sides of the same coin of the idea
1043920	1051760	of trying to give proper priority, you know, to quote Aristotle and people don't understand it,
1051760	1057120	you know, first things first, right? And people think that just means the first thing on your
1057120	1062480	list is the first thing you should do. That's not what Aristotle means. He means that the task is
1062480	1069840	to realize what the first principles are and to prioritize them over things that are less
1069840	1077280	central to being and to truth, et cetera. And so, and I think of that as the virtue of reverence.
1077280	1084080	And I think reverence is to properly realize the relevance of something that should be given
1084080	1089280	a priority even over yourself. And that's where it starts. Yeah, that's where you start to get
1089280	1093760	the notions of sacrifice and worship, which I, like I say, if you go away from sacrifices,
1093760	1099920	killing something, right, which is usually focal in people's mind to this idea of prioritization
1099920	1105840	and a recognition and acknowledgement of priority, then I think I'm in agreement with what you're
1105840	1110720	talking about. Yeah, and the idea of killing something is always the wrong way of understanding
1110720	1117600	sacrifice, at least at the first level. It often involves killing something, but not necessarily.
1117760	1122880	There are sacrifices of grain, sacrifices of oil, all these different sacrifices. It has to do with
1122880	1129440	offering up. You take something that's precious, and then you give it up towards something which
1129440	1135200	is above you. And that's exactly what attention is, and that's what prioritization is. One of the
1135200	1140480	interesting things I wanted to ask you about, because there's something that I've been thinking
1140480	1144400	about, and there are several priests that are thinking about this right now, is that in the
1144400	1149520	Jewish law, like in the Hebraic law, during Yom Kippur, which was the day of atonement,
1149520	1155360	the day of becoming one, there were two sacrifices. And this, I'm wondering what you think about this
1155360	1161680	in terms of attention. There was a sacrifice which was offered up and was used to purify the space,
1161680	1168400	and then there was a sacrifice which was cast away, a scapegoat, which was sent out to Azizel,
1168400	1175600	which is a demon out in the wilderness. This is what I've been thinking about in terms of
1175600	1180160	attention, which is the attention seems to have two parts to it. One which is a concentration,
1180160	1187360	focus, prioritization, but another part which is a cutting off, a circumcision, a cutting off of
1188320	1194160	you have to be able to chop off the things that are pushing in or trying to take over, let's say,
1194160	1198880	and then so it's like a double movement, one of focusing and then one of pushing away. I don't
1198880	1208000	know if that's something that is consonant with. Yeah, I think it is, and I'll need a little bit
1208000	1216720	of space, but what I mean by that is, I think the prioritization function, so what I mean is give up
1216720	1223200	the old model of there's input and then there's processing and then there's output. The newer
1223200	1228080	model is there's a sensory motor loop. As I'm moving, I'm sensing, as I'm sensing, I'm moving,
1228080	1233520	and there really isn't anything, there isn't a homunculus willpower out there. Instead, there's
1233520	1239520	something more like character. There are sets of constraints on this, and then what we're doing,
1239520	1243920	and we remember, and attention is self-organizing like that because we both direct attention,
1243920	1250560	but attention also directs us, and so what we're trying to do is, what I'm trying to get you to
1250640	1256560	see is a new way of thinking of what decision is. Instead of thinking of decision as the
1256560	1262080	executor behind it all, like doing this, think of decision as exactly what you're saying.
1263520	1270560	A way of thinking about this is attention is both ruling in and ruling out. It's what's
1270560	1276000	ruled in and what's ruled out. This is analogous, one of my former students and now colleague,
1276080	1278720	Corey Lewis, talks about this in the philosophy of science. He talks about
1279600	1286720	that what laws do is they rule out. They say no, no, no, no, and that what models do is rule in.
1286720	1291520	This is what you have to bring in and this is what you have to prioritize in order to do your
1291520	1299760	thing. In an analogous fashion, attention is making decisions of ruling in and ruling out. Did
1299760	1304560	that help? No, that makes a lot of sense, and it makes a lot of sense. Also, if you think of things
1304640	1309760	like ancient law, like ancient Roman law, the way that it worked, there were two aspects of the
1309760	1318720	system, one which was a tortoise and a patestas. Patestas were the actual rules, like the military
1318720	1324240	or the embodiment of what you're not allowed to do, the police part of it. The other one was a
1324240	1329520	tortoise, which was the model, like you said, the thing you follow, the person you model your life
1329520	1338640	on. Someone who inspires you to be a certain way. It was a direct, non-explicit model. Then
1338640	1345520	the other one is an explicit set of rules that is lacking the more direct part of it. It ends up
1345520	1353040	being a right hand and a left hand of how the system works, let's say. You can see that with
1353040	1357440	the idea of the saints and then the canons of the church, for example, where you have models
1357440	1360720	you're supposed to follow, and then you have a bunch of things you're allowed to do or not allowed
1360720	1368400	to do, like all these rules that are more precise and more about what you're not allowed to do,
1368400	1377360	let's say. One way of thinking about it is attention has the function of constraining
1377360	1386320	possibility. This is impossible. It's structuring that, or at least this is highly improbable,
1386320	1391840	and this is even in predictive processing models of attention, but you also need attention
1391840	1401440	as also aspirational. Yeah, that's a nice word. Love that. Yeah. It's trying to disclose the
1401440	1408720	affordances by which we can more properly come into conformity or transformative relationship to
1408720	1413600	what's real, what's happening, what's relevant, what's pertinent, all the sort of stuff that I
1413600	1421840	tend to obsess about. Yeah, very much. Then the idea also that's happening with attention that
1421840	1430880	goes into this is to not have a humane model of attention. The humane model of attention is the
1430880	1436800	static impersonal observer and Toad in his book on body and mind says, that's why Hume can't find
1436800	1447200	causation of the world because his model of attention is a pure passive spectacle of observation
1447200	1456160	and not moving around engaging. The other thing is to, this goes with Christopher Moll's work,
1456160	1462320	that attention is adverbial. It's a way of modifying other things you're doing. Let me quickly
1462320	1467040	point out what I mean by that. We tend to think of attention as a spotlight and we shine it and
1467040	1470720	there's truth to that because light makes things stand out and that's what attention does. It
1470720	1475920	makes things more salient. But the thing is, and Moll points this out, but attention isn't like
1475920	1482960	walking. I can say to you, walk. Get up and walk. Okay. Now, if I say to you, start practicing,
1482960	1488800	you'll say to me, practice what? Or if I say, train, begin training, you'll go train what?
1488800	1492160	The things we do that we do by modifying other things. And if I say to you,
1493040	1496000	you have to do this a little bit or subtly to bring it up. I say, I want you to pay attention,
1496000	1501760	but I don't want you to pay attention by changing how you're looking or how you're listening or how
1501760	1506080	you're remembering or how you're coordinating, looking, listening and remembering. I just want
1506080	1514880	you to pay attention and you'll say to me, I don't know what that means. Attention is a way in which,
1514880	1520480	this is what I mean. It's more adverbial. It's a way in which we're modifying our connectedness
1520480	1525440	to reality. And it's not like it's not a beam coming out of our head. It's a shaping of our
1525440	1531360	whole orientation and connectedness to reality. It's a much more comprehensive thing. Does that
1531360	1537360	make sense? It makes a lot of sense. It makes a lot of sense because at least in kind of the
1537360	1542400	orthodox perspective, theological perspective, there really is this idea of synergistic
1543120	1548960	relationship, like synergistic relationship with God, where like you said, there's a sense in which
1548960	1555360	you're kind of called, like you're called for, and then you kind of moved forward, but that also
1555360	1561360	affects the amount of calling or the direction of calling. So it's something that's very difficult
1561360	1565920	to fully separate and say something like, you know, like that's God acting, that's you acting.
1565920	1572240	It's like, no, it's this constant moving between this call towards your own telos and then your
1572480	1577440	capacity to embody it and then it modifies the direction. So it's like you said, it's a more
1577440	1583120	kind of, it's a synergistic model in terms of how we took what transformation.
1583120	1587920	It's synergistic this way. Exactly. There's the calling and it's not action or passivity,
1587920	1594720	it's participation, but it's also synergistic this way. It's not sort of a Cartesian theater
1594720	1601200	or Lockean theater. It's the whole person. Like if I would put it in a slogan and take caution around
1601200	1606160	that because it's a slogan, but you attend with your whole body. You don't just attend with sort of
1606160	1613760	through your brain. Yeah, right. That's what I'm trying to get at. And then another dimension of
1613760	1622080	that is the fact that attention is often shared in it. Like distributed attention is a significant
1622080	1629040	part of distributed cognition. So wait, like children, if you watch babies, like they joint
1629120	1635360	attention in that loop that you're talking about not like between people is what makes language
1635360	1643840	learning possible. Like attention is there primordially, joint attention. And we take it for
1643840	1652960	granted. Like when I point, you look, you try and trace out my attention. But if you point,
1652960	1658080	like for any other animal, they look at your finger because you hate it salient, right?
1658080	1663920	But and notice how kids, when kids are at the one word stage, they supplement it with pointing.
1664880	1672480	So they use joint attention to make meaning, to make meaning clear. So again, it's more whole
1672480	1681120	person. It's more dynamic. And it's more shared and joint. I mean, it's funny. You'll like this.
1681760	1687920	There's a line in the Psalms that is sort of resonating with me as I get into this,
1687920	1692880	which there's a line where it says deep calling to deep, right? The deep calling to deep, right?
1695280	1700800	And so that that's that's sort of my, I don't know what to put, I don't mean I'm not trying to be
1700800	1705440	sacrilegious anymore. I'm trying to be say something that stands out for me. That's kind of a biblical
1705440	1711200	motto, I guess I have for this, for the way of thinking about this. And it is properly,
1712160	1715840	again, for me, because it again, it brings up this deep connection we're talking about
1715840	1721760	between all of this and religio, right? So here's a question in terms of study,
1721760	1724560	because this is something that I've been talking about and thinking about, but I'd like to know
1724560	1730560	your opinion on it. It seems that we have something also about common joint attention.
1731520	1738240	We seem to search out places and moments where we can all attend to similar things as a group,
1738240	1742160	right? So you go to a concert, even just in terms of entertainment, why do you go to the
1742160	1746080	movie theater? Like we all sit together and then we watch, of course there's the big screen,
1746080	1749840	but there's something more than the big screen, which is why we like watching movies with friends
1749840	1755680	and with with family. And so it seems like there's also something in terms of that there's a
1755680	1762160	transformation which occurs through to common attention. And that seems for the good and ill,
1762160	1767600	right? And so you I have the image of Hitler, you know, with like 100,000 people all standing in
1767600	1773280	front of him and just giving him all their attention and it and it acting as like a catalyst for
1773280	1778400	something insane. So I don't know if there's if people have studied that or talk very much,
1778400	1782480	very much. I mean, so first of all, it goes directly to the point I just mentioned and
1782480	1789360	people like Thomas Sello and others have made that apparent. How much of our cognitive development
1789360	1796160	depends on is afforded by joint attention, the capacity for joint attention. And you think about
1796160	1802640	why this would matter to hunter-gatherers, like joint attention is absolutely crucial for coordination,
1802640	1807920	social coordination. It goes towards the work that Dan Chiapia and I have published about
1808000	1813120	scientists, the NASA scientists, controlling the rovers on Mars. And how do they how do they
1813120	1820640	can how do they get how do they coordinate their attention? But it also goes towards this. And
1820640	1824640	think about how this works both internally and externally and how they reinforce each other.
1825200	1831120	Notice and we know this even for young children and psychologists have the settings in of giving
1831120	1835920	multiple names to the same problem, but the same phenomena or calling two different phenomena by
1835920	1839920	the same name. It's called the jingle jangle problem. So it's known by many different names,
1841600	1846240	inter sensory hypothesis and blah, blah, blah, intermodal and blah, blah. Okay. But they all
1846240	1851520	are talking about the same thing that a child will prefer to look at a stimulus that it can both
1851520	1859680	see and hear over a stimulus they can just see or that it can see and hear and touch. Right. And
1859680	1864800	then there's good reason for this. If you have just I'll use some cybernetic language. If you have
1864800	1871120	just a single channel, the chances that what you're seeing are due to subjective bias or distortion
1871120	1877520	are quite high. But if I have two independent channels, the chances that the result is due
1877520	1883680	to bias are reduced precisely, right, because of the increase of that convergence. That's what by
1883680	1888400	the way, and it's not just sort of fascism. The reason why we like numbers is because numbers
1888400	1894240	allow us to coordinate the senses. You can see three, you can hear three, you can touch three,
1894240	1899920	three allows us to bind the senses together. And what that does is in using Russia's term,
1899920	1905200	that increases the trustworthiness, not certainty, but it increases the trustworthiness of the
1905200	1909520	information we're getting. Now think about this and Plato brings this out in the dialogues,
1909520	1916160	when we can do that with each other. So it's not only within my senses, but between how
1916160	1920960	all of us are trying to make sense. Think about how that massively increases the trustworthiness.
1921760	1926720	Aristotle treated it as one of the three marks of realness. If you had rational,
1926720	1931760	intersubjective agreement, then it must be real. We know that that's not right. Things we can get
1931760	1937760	that agreement, like you said, Hitler, and it can still be false. But that's why you shouldn't
1937760	1943360	confuse trustworthiness with certainty. But trustworthiness is valuable. I mean, it's very valuable.
1943360	1952640	And so we want to share with other people what's happening because it makes it more real for us
1952640	1962080	in a deep sense. And the way you afford that, what are you converging? You're converging attention.
1962080	1966720	You're converging attention. So that would be my explanation for that.
1966720	1971280	Yeah, that's a really wonderful, I mean, when you say it that way, it makes so much sense.
1971520	1976400	It's just completely reasonable to understand that if you have a group of people and you're
1976400	1981200	attending to something, it increases the reality of the thing you're attending to because you're
1981200	1985760	constantly aware that, okay, so here's a hundred people, they are all attending to the thing I'm
1985760	1990880	attending to. So maybe I need to attend to it. Like maybe there's something real about what's
1990880	1998000	happening or more real than a more idiosyncratic moment, let's say. But this says a lot about
1998000	2004960	our situation right now, because I have children. And to imagine they spent months and months sitting
2004960	2011200	alone on Zoom watching their teacher or even in class with masks on where you don't see other
2011200	2016800	people's faces. This has a major effect, I imagine has a major effect on their capacity to pay
2016800	2022720	attention and to kind of make sense of what's going on. I think it has, I mean, I think our
2022720	2026000	children are going to be especially sensitive to it, especially young children. But I think it
2026080	2034640	has an impact on everybody. So one of the things, because I was talking to people during COVID about
2034640	2040720	this, and one of the adjectives that kept coming up, one of these two adjectives, things seem
2040720	2050320	unreal or they seem surreal. There's a sense of losing touch with reality because the capacities
2050320	2057680	for joint attention were being truncated or they were being transferred to this weird kind of joint
2057680	2063280	attention that we have right here right now, which is very odd for us. It's a very odd kind of joint
2063280	2069120	attention. Yeah, and that gives me another layer of understanding of the Floyd protest, because
2069120	2072880	for me, it's been something that I've been trying to understand so much. But that all of a sudden
2072880	2079600	puts another layer on it, which is that people for months had been starved of joint attention in many
2079600	2085600	ways, whether it was sports or religion or whatever clubs that people participated in,
2085600	2090560	whatever concerts people went to. And it wasn't necessarily a conscious thing, but they were
2090560	2095280	just starved for attention. And then all of a sudden, when this point of attention, very salient
2095280	2101680	point of attention appeared on their horizon and the opportunity to kind of join together and celebrate
2101680	2107360	or, I mean, it wasn't celebrate, but in the general sense of just kind of getting angry about the
2107440	2114640	same thing. And so it just exploded into these moments. I think that's true. I mean,
2114640	2122240	you and I talked about it besides whatever, and I think there were legitimate reasons about
2122240	2129120	social justice and about inequity. And I think those are real. But I think above and beyond that,
2129120	2134160	there was something else that was being poured into this. And it's still reverberated through.
2134800	2140560	I think you see that in there's many instances of this kind of hunger. One of the things we're
2140560	2146000	discovering about attention is not only is it bottom up, it grabs our attention, it goes from
2146000	2151680	features to the Gestalt and top down, we can direct it from sort of larger Gestalt to specific
2151680	2158240	details. But there's also what you might call a historical dimension. So attention is not only
2158320	2164480	organizing up, down, it's organizing past, present. So your previous history of what you're
2164480	2169840	paying attention to has an impact on what will jump out for you as salient right now.
2171040	2175920	And so with Tim Leathercraft and Blake Richards and I, we tried to actually
2175920	2179840	put that into our relevance realization model that there's these opposing tendencies
2181280	2187520	to try and stay with something if it's sort of similar to your past patterns of attention.
2187520	2192560	But there's also good evidence for what's called inhibition on return. We also want to move away
2192560	2196800	from what we've paying a lot of attention to. And so these two things are playing each other out.
2196800	2200320	And I think if you push the attentional pendulum, if you'll allow me that metaphor,
2200320	2204720	too far one way and starve people, there's going to be, there's going to be a rebound
2205600	2212080	the other way people are going to hunger for, like you said, something that can be
2212240	2220160	co-realized through joint attention. Yeah. And that can also make you understand the problem of,
2221200	2228320	let's say, ill practice asceticism, right? Where that if you're not careful, asceticism can actually
2228320	2233680	lead to, to excesses back and, you know, like the idea of a diet, right? The idea of people
2233680	2239840	dieting where they, they, they're able, they try to just like not pay attention to the thing.
2240400	2245920	And then all of a sudden it just cracks and, you know, you're coming. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly.
2245920	2254160	Exactly. That's a very good analogy. I mean, the thing is to try to get the, the virtue,
2254160	2259680	the golden mean of a schesis, right? Of, of, of discipline, of spiritual exercises.
2260960	2264880	Well, and the schesis in the traditional sense is always a redirecting of attention.
2264960	2270560	Yes. You hear it all the time. People say you don't just fast. If you fast and you don't pray,
2270560	2274160	you're in trouble. Like you're going to be in way more trouble than you were before you started
2274160	2279120	fasting. Like when you fast, you have to go to church, pray, you have to redirect your attention
2279120	2283440	or else it's not, not only is it not going to work, but it's going to be damaging to your soul.
2283440	2289280	That's why I argue that we shouldn't just practice in the mindfulness traditions. And this is western.
2289280	2295360	It's not, it's, it's, it's not, it's not, you know, it's ethnocentric, right? We shouldn't
2295360	2300480	just practice meditation, right? Which is a kind of thought fast. We should also practice
2300480	2305040	contemplation, which is, and now once you've opened up that space through the thought fast,
2305040	2310880	what can you theoria? What can you contemplate that you couldn't see before? That's part of that
2310880	2317360	why Leo and I made that argument about the fact that we, we've, we've, we've reduced all this whole
2317360	2322560	ecology to this one practice and then we've reduced that practice. Like the definition of
2322560	2328320	mindfulness as, you know, paying attention to the present moment, that's, that's not what sati means,
2328320	2332800	right? And I understand that's good language of praying, the cabbage in used, but that's not
2332800	2337680	good language of explaining what's going on when you're trying to meditate, for example.
2338800	2342320	All right. So here's going to be my, this is going to be my big push on you here. So get ready.
2342400	2350080	That's fine. You don't have to push on me. All right. So, so human beings have capacity for
2350080	2357120	attention and it seems like that capacity for attention has a certain priority and, and that
2357120	2365360	priority seems to be personal. Like that is that we pay attention to people first. Faces. Yes,
2365360	2371840	we pay attention to faces, to people. And then, then we can pay attention to more abstract things,
2371920	2377920	but those abstract things, even those abstract things often end up concentrating in a person,
2377920	2382080	right? So you, you, you want to train, but you can't. So you get a coach and then all of a sudden
2382080	2385920	you can train. Like, why is it that you can train because you have a coach, but you can train if
2385920	2391840	you don't have a coach? It's because the coach is focusing your desire for attention into something
2392720	2398960	into a person that's, that's actually communicating and directing and, and becoming like a node for,
2398960	2406080	for even the more abstract telos that you have. And so this is, this is, I guess this is my big
2406080	2412080	question in terms of the manner in which reality exists, which is that I've been positing, like
2412080	2418560	I've been really working towards positing that reality has, even though I agree with you that
2418560	2424720	you could say that the infinite is transpersonal, but that as this infinite manifests itself in
2424720	2431200	the world, then it tends to take personal, it tends to culminate into personal beings.
2432240	2438160	And so my question is always for you is always to think like the idea of transpersonal, not
2438160	2442800	transpersonal in the sense of beyond humans, but I mean, I mean transpersonal in the sense of
2442800	2447520	beyond humans, but personal beings that are not human, let's say the idea of angels and the
2447520	2455200	idea of bodhisattvas or the idea of, of God's little G gods as being the manner in which reality
2455200	2458480	presents itself to us and the manner in which we encounter it, let's say.
2459680	2462880	Well, and Paul's made us, Paul medically has made a similar argument.
2462880	2464800	Okay, all right. I didn't know that.
2464800	2470880	He asked me to critique it. He invoked Pascal's difference between the spirit of geometry and
2470880	2475600	the spirit of finesse and his argument of the spirit of finesse is, is most appropriately
2475680	2482240	afforded in personal relationships. And, and so let me try and first of all strengthen your position
2482240	2485360	for you before I demolish it. No, no.
2490400	2494480	So like we're talking about joint attention and I was talking about its development and you can
2494480	2500880	link this to Bogotsky and to a lot of like, so let me give you another example of prioritizing
2500880	2505280	and paying attention. This is an experiment that's done. I've seen the video of this experiment.
2506000	2509600	So give me a moment and then I'm going to go somewhere with this and you're going to see
2510640	2516480	how it's going to strengthen your point and then, and then, and then I'll, I'll, I'll offer my
2516480	2522640	cautions. I'm not trying to demolish. I don't want to do that. So what you have is you have the,
2523280	2528080	so what you have is there's two participants in the experiment. There's a chimp, an adult chimp
2528080	2532320	and a four year old girl. Of course, this was replicated with lots of individuals. I'm just
2532320	2536960	using this for the purposes of narrative, right? And you have this box, right? And you have the
2536960	2541280	adult come in and first of all, you show the chimp and the box has all these buttons and levers
2541280	2547120	and the human does this very complicated pattern of pushing buttons and levers. And at the end,
2547120	2551760	a candy comes out and eats it. And what's really fascinating is the chimp watches once and then
2551760	2558080	replicates the pattern and gets the chocolate or whatever the candy and you go, wow, that's
2558080	2561920	impressive. And there's some, there's some evidence that their ability, their working memory attention
2561920	2566720	is stronger than ours because we sacrifice a lot for language. And then you bring in the four year
2566720	2571440	old girl and you sort of, I picture myself as cheering. I've got a little human flag, go human,
2571440	2579760	right? And they show the girls this and she just takes one and she replicates it and she gets the
2579760	2584720	candy and you go, wow, that's cool. Now, and this is the experiment. Now you bring in the box,
2584720	2588720	but now the box is plastic and completely transparent, all the same levers and buttons.
2588800	2592720	You bring the chimp in, the human adult goes through all of this and it's clear that the only
2592720	2596720	thing that releases the candy is the last action. All the other actions do nothing.
2598240	2602000	So that you does this and then the chimp and the chimp sort of looks at the human being like
2602880	2608800	and just pushes pulls the last thing and gets the candy and you go, oh, that's smart. And you
2608800	2614240	bring in the four year old girl and she watches and the adult does this and she can see that only
2614240	2618240	the last thing releases the candy. What does she do? She repeats everything the adult did.
2619120	2624880	And you go, oh, are four year olds stupider than chimp? And then you realize, no, no, no,
2625520	2632000	the human is playing the long game. The girl is thinking, the girl is thinking, obviously,
2632000	2639440	it's not she's thinking, this adult probably sees things I cannot yet see. This adult probably
2639440	2646960	knows things that I do not yet know. I'm going to imitate them because that will allow me to
2647040	2651920	transcend my own perspective. It's very hard to transcend your perspective from within your
2651920	2658240	perspective. But if a child imitates an adult's perspective, they get the capacity to transcend
2658240	2664080	their own bias. And what and Bogotsky's theory is, and here's the joint attention and the looping,
2664080	2671040	we do this enough until I can do it without you being around. I do it imagineally. I imagine
2671760	2676080	in the sense that you're there. I don't mean an image, but my metacognition is basic. Well,
2676560	2680240	think about all the imagistic language. What do you do in metacognition? You rise above your
2680240	2684640	cognition and you look at it. There's no space there. So what we're doing is we're
2684640	2690960	imagineally augmenting our ability. And that's what internalization is. I and you, we got a capacity
2690960	2697120	to become metacognitive, aware of ourselves and transcend ourselves by imitatively internalizing
2697120	2702720	other people. And did you see what that strengthens your argument deeply? Because it means I
2703600	2712640	my capacity for self-transcendence, development, transformation comes for how deeply I can
2712640	2718800	internalize you. And then you pair that with Polania's idea that I can internalize you better.
2718800	2724560	The more I can indwell you, the more I can see things from your perspective, the more I can,
2724560	2730720	right? So I want to indwell you as deeply as possible. And that allows me to internalize
2730720	2736640	you and vice versa, hopefully, too. Hopefully, it's not one way and consumatory, right? And what
2736640	2744240	that means is that my capacity for self-transcendence is deeply dependent on a medic ability in a
2744240	2749360	profound way. And it's a two-way. It's this joint attention, this looping, the sentry motor,
2749440	2759840	this mind-site resonance. And so it's deeply within us that we transcend by internalizing
2760720	2766880	personifications. And I'll use that as a neutral term. Now, I think that strengthens your case
2766880	2773680	tremendously. I think so. I think definitely, I think so. And I think that you can understand
2773680	2779200	that as, if you think about it, bottom up as scaling up, right? As scaling up in terms of
2779200	2787040	personalities into kind of personalities that are beyond just the person I meet during a meeting
2787040	2794000	or whatever, but that they would become figures of personal attention that are communal, right?
2794000	2801360	That can be something like a god or like an angel or something which binds our community together.
2801360	2811360	And so we imitate Athena or we imitate Aries. Very much. Sorry. I said very much. And if we
2811360	2817520	have a hyper-objects of persons, like people gathered into hyper-objects, like Athens being,
2817520	2822960	right, and Athena is a way of, so George Herbert Mead had this idea of the generalized other,
2822960	2828080	right? So that thing that the little girl just did with the adult. Imagine trying to do that on
2828080	2832960	a baseball team. This is George Herbert Mead's model, right? And trying to get that individual
2832960	2838400	personally tailored to each person, that's very, very hard, right? And because you're constantly
2838400	2843280	shifting who you're. And so Mead argued that we create what he called the generalized other.
2843280	2849360	We create kind of this model that is somehow the intersection of all these individual models.
2849360	2853600	And by relating to that, I can effectively coordinate with all these other people and they
2853600	2860480	with me, the generalized other. So you can think of Athena as, Athena is not just this.
2861920	2867040	But she is a generalized other of Athens that people could internalize
2867040	2872560	to become an Athenian in a very profound sense. Yeah. So we're talking about a bottom up.
2875440	2879200	I think in our context, it's easier to talk about a bottom up also to help
2879200	2882000	understand its relationship to like say something like cognitive science.
2882720	2887920	And so is there, this is also something that I'm interested in. Is there a way in which that
2887920	2896320	generalized other would find a head in an embodied person? So take the baseball team,
2896320	2901920	right? So the baseball team creates a generalized other through which to act. But then that
2901920	2907680	generalized other will be kind of embodied in the team captain. So it's like the team captain is
2907680	2913200	kind of raised up and named. And then he's not the generalized other, but he becomes something
2913200	2923760	like the place through which we can attend. And then it'll kind of stream down into the team.
2923760	2929520	So the team can cohere. A way of thinking about it is the formal cause of the generalized other
2929520	2934320	gets transformed into an efficient cause that we can actually have joint attention upon,
2934320	2940000	something like that. Is that fair to what you're saying? No, that makes sense. And you could explain
2940000	2945760	all the traditions of the kind of the God embodied in the king, let's say, that you find in Egypt and
2945760	2953840	in all these different cultures, the idea of how the, or the emperor, the idea of the divine emperor,
2953840	2959680	all of these ways in which, because Christian, I obviously don't agree with doing this, but
2959680	2964000	when they worship the emperor, they didn't worship the emperor, right? They worshiped the
2964000	2970720	emperor's genius. Yes, exactly. And so they worshiped like a transpersonal version of the
2970720	2977280	emperor, which was embodied in the emperor as a focal point for our attention. But nobody thought
2977280	2985280	that the physical emperor was, let's say, a guy. He was a guy, right? There was something above
2985280	2990640	him, which was calling us into our communion, you could say. Yeah, there's the empire, and the
2990640	2995760	empire is a hyper-object. And everybody's prosperity and peace depended on being in
2995760	3000800	right relationship with that hyper-object. But hyper-objects require, like we just,
3000800	3005840	they require some, right, something like that. They require a face, or they require a personal
3005840	3010560	being that we can relate to. That we can relate to so that we can properly do the internalization.
3010560	3014560	So we can do the, we can imagineally, not imaginary, we can imagineally
3015760	3021360	enter into right relationship with the empire. We can be devoted to the empire and internalize the
3021360	3028000	empire's values and normativity by being devoted to the genius, the capacity of the emperor to
3028000	3035680	lead and be the voice of the empire. Yes, very much. And for me, I would say that another great,
3035680	3040160	this is how I've tried to understand, and again, I don't mean this disrespectfully,
3040160	3044720	however, I've tried to understand prophecy. I don't see prophecy as fortune telling.
3044720	3050080	I don't see it like that. I see prophecy as doing exactly what you're saying, that the
3050080	3057760	prophet somehow takes something and becomes, right, the vehicle of the form. There's a tradition
3057760	3063440	in later Neoplatonism of distinguishing between the form and the vehicle by which the form can come
3063440	3070320	into efficient causation, right? And this is what, this was one of the origins of this,
3070320	3075280	the idea that's now become this new age idea of the astral body and all that, the Akama,
3075280	3081760	was this, that there's a part of us that, right? And the ontology is not important. The point I'm
3081760	3086720	trying to make is that there was this distinction between the form and the vehicle, right? So,
3087840	3092320	you know, there's the form of the good, but it needs a particular vehicle by which it instantiates
3092320	3098400	itself in a human being. Yeah, that makes sense. Because then that idea of prophecy
3098400	3104800	is far closer to my own understanding, which is that prophecies don't just predict the future.
3105680	3111520	They predict the future to the extent that they manifest a pattern. Like they're actually showing
3111520	3117440	you a pattern of how reality manifests itself to you. And in that context, and of course,
3117440	3122800	it predicts the future because it kind of is able to pull out of even of how a society lays itself
3122800	3128720	out and is able to understand that here are some inevitable patterns in which, in how something will,
3128720	3135520	like an identity will go to its end, let's say. So then it imagistically embodies through these
3135520	3141200	kind of very, very imagistic stories how, you know, what that means. And that's very much,
3142080	3146720	like the platonic notion of a form is not some sort of like the platonic notion of a triangle
3146720	3152240	isn't like a perfect triangle. It's much better. And this is happening. And I'm actually involved
3152240	3156240	in this work to try and think of the form, the platonic forms phenomenologically, like
3156960	3163520	ideas from Arlo Ponti, like, I can show you this, right? And you never see the object.
3164240	3169680	You always see aspects of it. Yeah, yeah, there's multi, it's multi aspectual, but there's a
3169680	3174400	through line. They're not fragmented. And that through line also looks up to the through line
3174400	3181680	of yourself, which is also a through line of the multi aspects of you, right? But the through
3181680	3188480	line of the multi aspectuality is not another aspect. That's the mistake, right? It's not another
3188480	3196400	aspect, the form. But what do we do? What we do is we usually draw things from a standard position
3196400	3203200	because that's a vehicle that's supposed to stand in for something that we can't actually capture
3203280	3209600	in a picture. So the form comes into a vehicle by which we can face it to some of our language.
3209600	3213760	Is that lining up with what you're... No, that makes a lot of sense. And I think the things
3213760	3218960	you're saying are going to be very useful for materialists to understand what it is that
3218960	3223120	we're talking about. I always have that fear that some people watch our videos and have no idea what
3223120	3229520	we're even talking about. But I think what you're saying is really appropriate. And so
3230480	3235600	this is like, I think that even until now, the way you're talking about it and the way that I'm
3235600	3242400	talking about it, being cautious in the sense of, let's say, talk about imaginably interacting with
3242400	3251520	these beings that are... But the question is, like my proposition is something like those
3251520	3258160	beings exist as much as you do, right? The transpersonal, like the beings that bind the
3258160	3264160	community together and become... Take up a face and become principalities for the world to exist,
3264160	3268400	they have as much existence as a person. They just exist at another level, let's say.
3269840	3275440	So first of all... That's the big... That's my big... That maybe is the... Like, you can say that that's
3275440	3279520	what makes me an explicitly religious person. It's something like that, you know?
3279520	3285360	Yeah. First of all, let me try and give a lot of ground towards that position, given what I've
3285360	3290400	already said. So what I should therefore be relatively consistent with. I've already admitted
3290400	3299360	the existence of hyper-objects. I've already... The work I do on Deologos, that there's...
3300480	3304960	A dynamical system takes shape. That's something beyond all of the individual
3304960	3310480	consciousnesses and personalities there. When we were talking with Jordan and Bishop,
3311680	3315040	I would use this language. I don't think it's inappropriate. I'm using it in a Greek fashion.
3315040	3320560	There was a Logos that was present beyond all of us and we started getting caught up in it
3320560	3326000	and following it. And I think that's completely appropriate to say. And I've experienced that.
3326000	3330560	I've seen people from religious and non-religious experiences in circling and other things. They
3330560	3334640	encounter that. I want to acknowledge all of that. I also want to acknowledge...
3337280	3343520	And this comes out of Corbin and Ibn Arabi and a whole bunch of work.
3345280	3348720	You know what a heads-up display is like in a cockpit for a pilot?
3349200	3357840	So the pilot can't afford to look down, divert their attention. And so what you do is you project
3357840	3363120	onto the screen a bunch of things so they can actually look through the screen and get the
3363120	3369360	information at the same time. Or like Pokemon Go where you have augmented reality. Here's a
3369360	3373440	proposal to you to... Now, I'm doing it in good faith. I'm trying to move towards what you said.
3373440	3380240	So give me a bit of patience. If we properly distinguish between the imaginal and the imaginary,
3380240	3385680	that the imaginal is transjective and not subjective the way the imaginary is in Corbin's
3385680	3392160	sense, the imaginal, I think it's very reasonable. And Dan and I published on this. We see the
3392160	3399360	scientists doing this for the imaginal augmentation of reality. So for example, let me give me a
3399360	3404560	concrete example. The scientists are getting these flat black and white pictures from the
3404560	3409840	rovers on Mars. What they're looking for in the researchers are people who can get the sense of
3409840	3416560	being on Mars, of being the rover, like seeing as the rover does. And what do they do? By the way,
3416560	3420720	what does the scientists do? They do this loop. First of all, they identify with the rover.
3420720	3424880	They don't say, move the rover there. They say, we should go there. The rover is we.
3425600	3430400	Right? And then they also, so they indwell the rover, but they also internalize it.
3430400	3435840	So you'll get a scientist saying, so say, oh, this is what we need to do. Put your phone front
3435840	3440880	and she's on a wheelchair. And she does this. These are the, we need to do this. And she enacts
3440880	3448560	and embodies the rover. And then you'll get these literal rocket scientists saying stuff
3448560	3454320	like this is almost a verbatim quote, Jonathan. You know, I was in my gardening and my right
3454320	3460400	wrist kept getting stuck. And then I came to the lab and spirit. That's ironically one of the names
3460400	3466160	of the rovers. It's right wheel kept getting stuck. And I don't know. I don't believe in magic,
3466160	3471840	but you know, there's some kind of sympathy, ha, ha, ha. And they laugh, right? And that's what I
3471840	3476000	mean. And what do they do with those pictures in order to do that? You know, those wonderful
3476000	3480320	panoramic pictures they send back, they're not for the science, they're for us. Yeah, what they do
3480320	3485200	is they take these pictures and they color them and they scribble on them and they mark them all
3485200	3491440	out for a test. He calls it drawing as and all of that imaginal work allows them to draw out so
3491440	3498240	that they can be on Mars and be the rover. This is what we've recently published on. This is not
3498240	3504880	some, you know, airy fairy stuff. I think, right? I know what that's like when I'm doing Tai Chi.
3504960	3511440	When I'm trying, right, that Tai Chi, they'll say, like, you know, like imagine that you're pushing
3511440	3518240	on a ball and you go, why? And then you do that, you go, oh, that's why. And by doing the imaginal
3518240	3524480	thing, you interact with the world in the right way so you see things you wouldn't otherwise see.
3524480	3529440	Does that make sense? The imaginal augmentation? Yeah, no, that makes sense. Okay, now let's go
3529440	3533440	with what we talked about before, that we can have distributed cognition and we can have shared
3533440	3539200	attention and we can have shared imaginal augmentation that puts us into reality with hyperobjects.
3540240	3547520	I think that is, again, you might find this too reductionist, but for me, I can see a lot of
3547520	3554160	what I call the serious play of religion doing exactly that, right? You got this shared joint
3554160	3559920	attention and you're getting the distributed cognition and you're allowing for that shared
3559920	3565760	imaginal augmentation of reality perception, ontological depth reception, so that people can
3565760	3573280	see and realize hyperobjects that are otherwise invisible to them. Like Mars is when all I give
3573280	3579120	you is the flat photograph. If you'll allow me analogy, religion is taking the flat photographs
3579120	3586720	that were given and turning them into me being present on Mars in a way that allows me to do
3586720	3593440	the science. I can't do the science on Mars unless I get that sense of presence. Okay, so then
3594160	3598480	that's not everything you want. No, it's not everything I want, but so would you apply that
3598480	3604320	process to you? That is, would you, because you, because when I think my difficulty is that
3605600	3611920	I'm not sure in your model, like if you have this idea that we are, let's say, intelligent beings
3612640	3619120	and then, let's say, and then these other beings that we're talking about, right, they're kind of
3619120	3625680	projections of our intelligence or whether or not those beings, those intelligent beings exist
3626960	3632720	as much as I do, as in the same process that is like, let's say I also have all these parts and
3632720	3638720	all these thoughts and all these distraction and attentions and aspects of me that are
3638800	3645440	coordinating and are being pulled into the same attentions in order for me to exist as a
3646560	3650800	unified being, let's say. That's exactly, by the way, what Mohl says attention is, it's cognitive
3650800	3658560	unison. And if you were to ask me, do I think, and I think this is a very platonic model,
3659200	3664480	do I think that distributed cognition has a collective intelligence that is more than the
3664480	3671680	sum of the individual intelligences within it? Yes. I think that's, this goes back to Hitchens,
3671680	3676880	back in, you know, cognition of the world, who navigates a ship? There's no person that navigates
3676880	3684080	a ship. It's a crew and a bunch of equipment and that system has the intelligence to grasp
3684080	3689200	the hyper-object of the ocean and the hyper-object of the ship and navigate and coordinate them
3689200	3696400	together. And there's been some pretty gruesome experiments showing that collective intelligence
3696400	3700320	can do things that individual intelligence, there's a person who literally, I don't know how this
3700320	3706800	got through ethics, wired rats together so that their brains were wired and that group of rats
3706800	3713920	could solve problems that the individual rats couldn't solve. Really? Yeah. That doesn't surprise us.
3714000	3721920	Think about the power of the Internet that is given by distributed computation. No computer
3721920	3727280	can do this, but the network can create this hyper-object, you called it earlier, a God,
3727280	3736160	right? That is like so powerful for us in so many ways. So do I think that, and I think this is one
3736160	3741520	of the great insights of the platonic idea of dialectic. It's not the Hegelian dialectic.
3741520	3748480	The platonic dialectic is we can learn an art, and that's how it's thought, about coordinating
3748480	3754880	individual cognition into distributed cognition so we can access collective intelligence and perhaps
3755680	3760800	transform it into, participate, better way of putting it, participate in its transformation
3760800	3766720	into collective wisdom. Yeah. I mean, I think it's interesting because there are these,
3766720	3773040	even in the Thomistic theories about the idea that every time two beings are in relation with each
3773040	3778400	other, they have an angel. So if I'm talking to you and I'm actually in communion with you,
3778400	3786240	then there's an angel which is acting as a principality and becoming the intelligence
3786240	3791440	into which our communion is rising up into that intelligence. I would add one more thing to it,
3791440	3795920	which also strengthens your case. You've heard me talking about this a lot.
3797680	3805040	It's not just emergence up. There's not only the ruling in of the modeling,
3805040	3810160	there's the ruling out, the emanation that is constraining how these things can take shape.
3810160	3815040	They take certain shapes. That's why there are these reliable persistent patterns for good and
3815040	3820800	for ill. But there are these reliable, like you mentioned it in prophecy, the prophet can say,
3820800	3825920	like, there's reliable ways this can go. This can go this way and it can go this way. And he's
3826880	3833200	often addressing almost always, I'm sorry, sometimes the prophets were she, but mostly
3833200	3840240	they were he. Deborah was a prophet, I know that. But they are almost always identifying
3840240	3845280	like Israel in the collective, not just sometimes they address the king, but often the king is just
3845280	3850560	the representative for Israel. And there's a spirit that they're trying to address.
3851120	3858240	Right. And so I would say all of that. Now, where you and I probably disagree,
3858240	3862480	and I'll just, all right, so I'm trying to do Genuine Deologous. I'm trying to.
3862480	3863040	Thank you.
3863680	3870560	Yeah. It is, you know, whether or not I don't think I have to be really careful.
3870560	3881360	So I think there is a proper way of talking about something like God, you know, in Spinoza's sense
3881360	3887200	or in the nontheistic sense, your notion that there's something like the pattern of
3887200	3892800	relevance realization in reality realization that is analogous to the relevance realization
3892800	3900560	and cognition, I took, I think that seriously, I think that's right. But I'm, I, and this is where
3904640	3908720	I don't think there's a consciousness for that collective intelligence.
3909840	3918640	And I don't, and I don't think there's an agency to it in the same way we understand
3918640	3922640	the agency of living things. There might be something analogous. I'm open. And by the way,
3922640	3927200	this is not just, this is not just me. And you'll find this amusing given our how we came to know
3927200	3934160	each other. Many people talk about the power of the collective intelligence of distributed
3934160	3940560	cognition as a zombie intelligence. Oh, really? Yeah, that's the term that's used. So the idea is
3941200	3948960	that, that consciousness, one of its properties might be that it only exists within a determinant
3948960	3955520	range, the things that you, so even within your own brain, within your own body embodied brain,
3955520	3959120	like you're not conscious of many levels, but you're not conscious of your neurons,
3959120	3964640	you're not confident, right? And there's lots of things at a higher level, like these hyperobjects,
3964640	3969600	you can't be conscious of them, you can be conscious of reference to them. But I can't,
3969760	3974720	there's no way in which I can be conscious of global warming. Like I can't do it, right? It
3974720	3979040	doesn't make any sense. I can think about it, and I can be conscious of my thinking of it,
3979040	3982880	but I can't be conscious of global warming the way I can be conscious of this object.
3983360	3989440	So wouldn't the fact that for thousands of years, and our let's say period being a complete
3989440	3995040	exception to that, for thousands of years, communities encountered these transpersonal
3995120	4001920	beings as being both conscious and having agency, and that they represented them as such, and talked
4001920	4007120	about them as such, and worshiped them as such, and etc, etc. Like even without talking about
4007120	4011760	God in the supreme kind of infinite way, like I don't want to talk about that too much. I want
4011760	4016880	to talk about the intermediary beings, they're easier to keep, they're easier to talk about.
4017760	4027120	I just wanted to be clear that I wasn't trying to deny a divine or sacred status to things above
4027120	4033520	us. I wanted to be clear about that. I wanted to be very clear about that. We'll put that aside,
4033520	4041920	as long as you acknowledge that that's a point I wanted to make. And you won't agree with it,
4042880	4048080	there's a brilliant anthropologist out there, Lerman, and she wrote a book and she has a whole
4048080	4056240	bunch of people, How God Becomes Real, and she talks about what you would call gods or spirits
4056240	4063120	become real for people. And she talks about the fact that we have these two different
4063120	4068160	senses of real. We may have three given that hyper-objects are real for us, and maybe they
4068160	4071600	all bleed together in important ways. That's something that phenomenology I'm trying to
4071600	4076960	work out right now with other people. But she talks about that these beings are real, but not
4076960	4083520	in the same way that other things are real for us. Sorry, this might come off as disrespectful,
4083520	4087200	but I'm just quoting, and she's not being disrespectful either, but one of the groups
4087200	4092640	she was studying was a group of evangelical Christians and for whom Jesus is real in the
4092640	4096960	way you're talking about. Now, I know that Jesus is also part of the Trinity, but I'm just trying
4097600	4101600	to call it the spirit of Christ or something like that, whatever. And she said,
4102800	4108640	Jesus is real, but you don't ask him to do your homework. That's what one evangelical
4108640	4114000	Christian said, which was like, whoa, that's a really interesting thing to say. You can ask
4114000	4117120	him to help you do your homework, but you don't say, I'm not going to do my homework, I'm going to
4117120	4122000	ask Jesus to do it. Now, there could be for moral or religious reasons, but it was clear in that
4122080	4130560	what the person was trying to convey, they were trying to convey this sense that the way these
4130560	4136320	beings interact with, for lack of a better word, physical reality is not the way physical things
4136320	4141120	interact with physical reality. Yeah, but it's a hierarchy. So it's like you could say something
4141120	4149360	like your finger doesn't ask you to clot the cut on it. Your finger doesn't ask you to clot the
4149440	4154640	blood in your finger, but you're still doing it through your body. That is, your body is the
4154640	4160080	manner in which you manifest yourself. And so that's why he's saying, Jesus doesn't do your homework.
4160080	4165120	You do your homework, but you can do that in a way that's participating in the body of Christ,
4165120	4172800	you could say. Right. But notice what's happening there. That seems to mean that their
4173680	4180080	realness as presence is always vectored through us as participating in them.
4181040	4185760	Right, because we're like parts of the body. Just like your finger is a part of you,
4185760	4191360	then we are part of Christ. Christ manifests himself. That's why he's like a higher consciousness.
4192320	4200320	Totally. So what I would then say is, for example, you don't think that because we've
4200400	4205520	networked all of the computers together, that the internet has consciousness, do you?
4206720	4210800	I'm pretty sure there's a God behind that. I'm sorry. I'm going to freak people out by saying
4210800	4215040	that. I've been pointing to it very closely, actually. I do think the internet is acting
4215040	4220640	as a body for a God. I do think so. And I think that the fact that it's moving without
4220640	4227200	anybody being able to stop it or control it or direct it completely. I agree with you on that.
4227200	4231840	So I agree on that. And that's a tricky thing, because Jung said that's the definition of spirit.
4231840	4239760	If it acts on its own, if it has a life of its own and a mind of its own, that's definitely when
4241040	4247120	we are liable to attribute spirit to it. But I would say just again, people have also
4247760	4253680	perennially done that with forests and with oceans and rivers. And I don't think that rivers have
4253760	4258240	consciousness or forests have consciousness. Well, it's not the river that has consciousness.
4258240	4263440	It's the angel that has consciousness. Just like your hand doesn't have consciousness.
4264000	4267600	It's the fullness of you in relationship to your hand that has consciousness.
4267600	4272960	Yeah, but see, and this is where we differ. I don't think there's a way of separating my
4272960	4278480	consciousness from my embodiment. No, I agree. Save you even for the river, let's say. But look,
4278480	4283120	you have a heart out now. I don't want to pull you. This is really just getting into the good
4283120	4287120	stuff. So let's just plan for another discussion. We haven't talked about this.
4287120	4294640	No, I like this. I like this. I hope you see that I'm not some dullard about this. I'm trying to,
4295520	4302160	I'm trying to, JP is very sweet about this. He sees me as trying to go as far as I can.
4302160	4308720	By the way, thank you so much for introducing me to him and Paul did that too and your tutelage
4308720	4313920	of him. I mean, it's, and I hope this doesn't sound condescending. It's meant as complimentary.
4313920	4318960	It's really wonderful watching him flourish. It's really wonderful watching him flourish
4318960	4325600	and thrive. I mean, JP is young. So it's like, I see the future as being extremely,
4326240	4329920	there are so many possibilities ahead of him. So I'm excited to watch that too. So yeah.
4330560	4337120	Yeah. So let's make it a part one and a part two then. So let's pick it up around this because
4338880	4344320	yeah, we're right on the cusp here because there is, I'll ask you to consider a possible
4344320	4351920	tension between participation and independence. How we get those together because that's for
4351920	4357280	me the nub of the issue. All right. I participate in my body and I don't think that John can be
4357280	4363040	separable or independent from it. Right. And I get that I'm not reducible to the descriptions
4363040	4367200	of the parts of my body. I concede all of that. And I think I've conceded that on all of the
4367200	4371120	examples I've talked about. Yeah. Yeah. Let's definitely, I'd say I'll just
4371120	4376880	write out say that's love, but we can talk about that and just open up that can and then
4376880	4382080	finish the discussion. So, so thank you so much. That's a great thing to lay on the table.
4382080	4386720	Thank you so much too. This is thanks and everybody also don't forget to check out
4386720	4390560	our conversation with Jordan Peterson and Bishop Barron. It's bound to make some waves
4390560	4395120	and so we're excited about that. And also looking forward to a conversation with Bishop Barron that
4395120	4399600	I will have. I don't know exactly when it's going to happen. Also pretty much very soon. And I hope
4399600	4404080	John that you also might have the chance to talk to him as well because I could see that he was
4404080	4408720	like, Oh, who's this? There's something that he's saying that is just it was kind of popping up in
4408720	4414080	his eye. So hopefully you can have a conversation with him as well. He was complimentary to me
4414080	4418160	in the blog that I read. So I'll reach out to him and have a conversation with him very much like
4418160	4423280	that. So thank you very much. All right. And so everybody, thank you. And we'll see you soon.
4423280	4425200	Bye bye. Take care. Bye bye.
