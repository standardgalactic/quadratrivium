Checking Jonathan Pageau/Collective Intelligence： Angels in Scientific Terms ｜ with John Vervaeke.txt
 In this discussion, Jordan Peterson and Rupert Sheldrake engage in a deep conversation about the nature of consciousness, particularly in relation to the internet and its potential for having a form of consciousness or spirit. They explore the idea that if something acts on its own with a life of its own, it might be attributed with spirit, as Carl Jung suggested.

Sheldrake, known for his hypothesis of morphic resonance, which posits that organisms evolve and learn in ways influenced by a collective memory accessible to all living things, shares his views on the internet acting as a body for a God-like force. He emphasizes that while he doesn't believe forests or rivers have consciousness, consciousness arises from relationships.

Peterson acknowledges Sheldrake's perspective and appreciates his attempt to push the boundaries of understanding. He expresses admiration for Sheldrake's work and its influence on him and others, like Paul Vanderklis, who Peterson has been mentoring.

The conversation touches upon the tension between participation and independence, particularly in how consciousness relates to the body—whether one is reducible to the sum of its parts or if there's an emergent property that cannot be fully described by the individual components.

Peterson and Sheldrake agree to continue the discussion in a follow-up conversation, highlighting the complexity and depth of the topic. They both look forward to future explorations on these themes, with Peterson mentioning his upcoming conversation with Bishop Barron and the possibility of Sheldrake also having a conversation with him.

The conversation ends with mutual appreciation and gratitude, with both parties expressing their eagerness for further dialogue and the potential for new insights into the nature of consciousness and reality.
