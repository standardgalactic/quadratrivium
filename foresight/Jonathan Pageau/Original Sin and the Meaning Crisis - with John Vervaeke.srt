00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,640
Welcome, everyone, to Voices with Raveke.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:16,240
I'm joined by and with my good friend, Jonathan Pajot, whose work on the symbolic world deeply

3
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:23,400
resonates with a lot of what I've been doing work on, and as many of you know don't know,

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:29,720
and I find Jonathan brilliantly insightful, and his reflections on the symbolic aspects

5
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:37,480
of existence and his ability to reshine and refurbish these stories so that they can shine

6
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:45,720
for us again is often, you know, it sort of catches you, it's deeply impressive.

7
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,600
So thank you, Jonathan, for coming.

8
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,880
Oh, it's my pleasure.

9
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:53,760
I always enjoy talking with you, you know, ever since I discovered your work and kind

10
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,080
of discovered the language which you're developing also to talk about these subjects.

11
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,680
It's been really helpful to me.

12
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:06,320
I find myself thinking in the categories that you are bringing forth and especially speaking

13
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:13,840
to kind of a secular audience or also convincing Christians that the words they use have meaning,

14
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,360
you know, because sometimes we have this kind of internal language and it stops to actually

15
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,920
be meaningful in the world and it just becomes like a kind of magical language.

16
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,800
So I've been using your expressions on attention, the idea of relevant realization, all of these

17
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,280
expressions have been good to help people re-see things in a different frame so that

18
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,280
they understand them.

19
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,680
So I really appreciate our discussions for sure.

20
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,760
Well, thank you for saying that, Jonathan.

21
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:47,440
I aspire to this being true, that above and beyond trying to, you know, convince or persuade

22
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:53,760
people about my specific claims, truth claims, theoretical claims, proposals, practical endeavors,

23
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,760
etc.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:03,800
I aspire that I do afford, you know, a vocabulary and a grammar for people that helps them to

25
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,160
clarify and develop their thinking.

26
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:11,440
I mean, that's the art, that for me, that's the way in which I try to enact the Socratic

27
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,600
ideal of being the midwife, right, the midwife for other people.

28
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,680
So thank you for saying that, that means a lot to me.

29
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,080
So what I wanted to start off specifically talking about, you released two excellent

30
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,600
videos, and I'll put the links to them in the description of this video.

31
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:34,320
One was on, I won't get the actual verbatim name, one was on sort of the religious nature

32
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:39,120
of a lot of the demonstrations that are happening around that were sort of galvanized into existence

33
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,800
by the death of George Floyd.

34
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:49,040
And then you did a follow-up, they were sort of like part one and part two, one on the

35
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,720
iconoclasm, the destruction of images, the pulling down of statues.

36
00:02:52,720 --> 00:03:00,120
And one of the things you did was you put your finger on a huge important aspect of this

37
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:08,000
that is being completely ignored in the mainstream media, but I think is of vital importance.

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,760
As has happened in the past between you and I, I, very convergent, I was coming to very

39
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,680
similar concerns and reflections.

40
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,880
And I'd said some things early on about how COVID was going to accelerate the meaning

41
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:27,960
crisis and cause just a mental health tsunami, and you'd see a proliferation of conspiracy

42
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:36,360
theory thinking, you'd see purity code behavior, human beings are going to respond in a fashion

43
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,640
to this invisible ubiquitous threat that's causing them to isolate.

44
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:46,720
And as you, I liked your invocation of the symbolic idea of fasting for most of their

45
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,200
connections.

46
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,360
And then I saw all of that.

47
00:03:52,360 --> 00:04:03,000
And then when the protests began, I had, so I had a reaction that made me sort of refuse

48
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,160
myself from committing, commenting on that publicly.

49
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:11,720
Part of it was a concern that what you said in your first video of just, you know, saying

50
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:16,360
something that would be premature polarizing, it was difficult to say anything that was

51
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:20,560
going to be heard with, that had any kind of nuance or reflection to it.

52
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,680
So part of it was just that kind of caution.

53
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,920
But there was a deeper issue for me.

54
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:31,000
I was very concerned, and I, I talked to my close friend about this, that I would fall

55
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,880
into a kind of self deceptive bias when I tried to talk about any of this.

56
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:43,240
So give me a moment, please, I don't mean to trespass on your patients, but I wanted,

57
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,320
in order to try and articulate this, and this has helped me upon reflection, I wanted to

58
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,720
invoke Weber's distinction between the manifest and the latent function.

59
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:58,400
So to give you a classic example, you know, Weber talked about the manifest, the manifest

60
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,400
function of the bureaucracy is to facilitate, you know, information traveling upward and

61
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:08,120
decision and struggling downward, and that's its manifest function, but it has all kinds

62
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,120
of latent functions.

63
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,360
It has the latent function of allowing people to diffuse responsibility and shift blame

64
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,360
on to others.

65
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,280
And Kafka, of course, brought this into high art.

66
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,720
He showed us how the latent function can, you know, put us into a tragic situation because

67
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:28,960
our commitment to the manifest function binds us in a tragic fashion to the latent function.

68
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,680
That can be antithetical to it in, in, in kind of a profound way.

69
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:42,160
And so I was, I was, I'm watching this and, and I, and I'm saying, well, yeah, that, that's

70
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,200
horrible and racism is a horrible thing and what we're seeing happening here.

71
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:52,760
And there's definitely, I know this because, you know, what's happened since, you know,

72
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:56,560
9-11 in the Patriot Act, there's been the militarization of the police.

73
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,840
And that has been a very dangerous thing, right?

74
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,200
And I know there's, there's, there's nasty tricks happening.

75
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,880
There's voter suppression happening and all kinds of bad things.

76
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:14,320
And people are feeling, I think legitimately manipulated and disenfranchised in powerful

77
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,320
ways.

78
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:20,320
And this, and this is meshing in ways that we're all finding it hard to understand with

79
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:24,320
a history that has disadvantaged certain groups of people.

80
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,240
And all of this is going on and I'm saying, yes, these are issues that all get addressed.

81
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,760
So my, I don't mean to sound Freudian here, but my sort of conscious explicit awareness

82
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,200
is going, yes, yes, yes.

83
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:40,040
But I'm having this negative visceral reaction to all of this and I'm trying to go, what's

84
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,040
going on?

85
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:45,120
And at first I'm, oh, you know, I'm making all these things and I, and I, and I can

86
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,120
feel it.

87
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,120
I'm in the grip of something.

88
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:52,840
And so I'm talking about this with my friends and I'm reflecting on it and, you know, journaling

89
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,840
about it and everything.

90
00:06:53,840 --> 00:07:00,040
And I'm coming to realize, oh, oh, and Jonathan, you know that I respect your allegiance to

91
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,040
Christianity.

92
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,600
I'm talking about me here.

93
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,600
Okay.

94
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:11,640
So I said, oh, this reminds, I'm back in my fundamentalist church and I'm the 10 year

95
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,640
old again.

96
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:17,520
And I'm being traumatized by a puritanical form of Protestantism.

97
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,720
I'm being told that I have an original sin that I, not because of any act that I committed,

98
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,200
but that is just because of how I was born.

99
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:30,440
And that there's an aspect of this that is unforgivable, no matter what I do.

100
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:36,080
And everything I try to do to overcome this just makes it that much worse.

101
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:45,480
And that I need, I need to be absolutely contrite and guilty until some external obscure authority

102
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:52,320
will finally pronounce me, you know, you know, saved or whatever.

103
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:57,040
And that, and then what this, what this brings with it, you know, is bonfires.

104
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,360
And I mean, I'm not, I'm not being hyperbolic, Jonathan.

105
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,600
I'm talking about gathering behind the church and putting the rock and roll albums and the

106
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,440
books into a thing and lighting it on fire.

107
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,600
Like can you imagine?

108
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,600
Oh yeah.

109
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,600
I've been through that too.

110
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,240
I grew up with that kind of stuff as well.

111
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,240
Okay.

112
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:21,440
And so, and, and, and so I'm realizing that the latent functionality of this is so reminiscent

113
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:31,480
of kind, of a kind of puritanical fundamentalist Protestantism, and again, I was noticing the

114
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:36,560
same things you're noticing, you know, the acts of contrition, the throwing down of the

115
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,040
stones in the high places, like from the Old Testament, right, where the prophets are always

116
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:48,720
doing that, right, the kneeling and the confessions and the statement that there's nothing I can

117
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,160
do about it other than feel guilty.

118
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:56,280
I was noticing how this is, was tremendously religious.

119
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:02,600
And that, that, as I said to others, that upbringing, like that upbringing traumatized

120
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,600
me.

121
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,000
I mean, I remember, I remember going to the minister and the church with my mother when

122
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,280
I, because I read the Bible regularly, daily, and, and I came across the passage in the

123
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,760
New Testament about the unforgivable sin.

124
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,760
Oh yeah.

125
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:22,040
Oh, and this just, I fell into, I mean, Cartesian skepticism was nothing compared to the well

126
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:26,480
I fell into about, well, how do I know what it is?

127
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,280
And how do, and how, like, did I just do it?

128
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,040
And if it's unforgivable, I'm now doomed.

129
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,840
I'm doomed, right?

130
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:37,720
And that feeling of being doomed and trapped and, and, and, you know, and I went to him

131
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:42,080
and I want, what I wanted was a clear definition of what it was.

132
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:49,040
And, and, and I got, I just got, you know, the usual, you need to have faith and, and

133
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,040
it was very unhealthy.

134
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:56,560
And so I, and so I was realizing, oh, John, you better keep your mouth closed about, because

135
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,040
even if you want to speak about this, this is just going to come flowing through you

136
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:06,720
because, and it's, and you're going to, it's a, because you have an incredible bias.

137
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,640
It's very hard for you to see this in a positive light, even though sort of intellectually

138
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,600
you can understand these important things that we've already mentioned, you know, the

139
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:22,520
rate, the, the, the racist history, you know, the, the, the, the subversive disenfranchisement

140
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:27,560
of people, right, the militarization of the police, all of these things are real and they

141
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,560
need to be addressed.

142
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:34,360
But, but I realized if I try to say anything about this, my chances of speaking in a way

143
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,360
that I think is clear, we're like going to be seriously undermined.

144
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,960
So I just sort of held back, but then I saw your videos.

145
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,680
And I thought, well, maybe I, maybe with Jonathan's help, I can talk about this.

146
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,880
Sorry, I don't intend this to be a therapy session.

147
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,000
That's not what's going on here.

148
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:55,760
I want to be really, I want to be really open with you about where I'm coming from.

149
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:03,720
And I think your video actually points out that this tension, well, let me, I might be

150
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:08,560
too bold. It suggested to me that this tension that I'm finding in myself is not exclusive

151
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:14,520
to me, that I, I sensed in you, not to the degree I'm talking about, but also a tension

152
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:20,080
between, you know, what this might be sort of at a manifest level, and then this unacknowledged

153
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:25,320
latent function of religiousness, and then you have some criticisms, at least implicit

154
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:30,960
of this, you had towards the end, you, you warned of danger in the, in the first video,

155
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:36,680
because the, the, the religion that does not know that it's a religion is not oriented

156
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:41,200
towards the ultimate. And so there's like a, like a critique coming like via, like, or

157
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,640
similar to what Tillich would meant. You're, it's, it's ultimately, it's an idolatrous for

158
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:50,880
all of its bringing down of images. It's ultimately an idolatrous religion. And then I was thinking

159
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:58,520
about this, I was thinking about how, you know, that politics is, is, has in many ways taken

160
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:04,400
over the domain of religion. I don't think well, it's drenched the 20th century in blood.

161
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:11,040
But I know that, well, there's sort of two, because religions are supposed to have, like

162
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,000
you said, there's supposed to be moments of communitas and transformation. And I'm trying

163
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,560
to think, well, what are, what are the only rituals left to politics? Well, there seem

164
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,920
to be two. And I was noted how they seem to split between the right and the left. There's

165
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:28,840
the demonstration of the protest or the rally. And the right likes the rally and the left

166
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:33,600
likes the demonstration protest. And then I'm thinking, and both of these, we have good

167
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,200
historical evidence, don't bring about the new man, the new person, the transformation

168
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:42,760
of human beings. And, you know, and all of the revolutions left then, right, the French

169
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:47,640
Revolution, et cetera, onward, show that it doesn't bring about that, although there

170
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:52,720
is often religious goal within the French Revolution, and, you know, they worshiping

171
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,280
the goddess of reason and all that stuff, right? It doesn't actually bring about the

172
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:07,400
promised transformation that it is groping towards. And so I was thinking that, is it

173
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:16,200
possible to talk about this sort of in terms that are kind of metapolitical about the latent

174
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:22,600
functionality of the religion, and at that level, legitimately criticize it without thereby

175
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:28,840
implying that we think, well, I'll speak on my behalf, not yours, without thereby implying

176
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:35,040
that I think that we shouldn't do something about militarization of the police, the subversive

177
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,920
suppression of voting and disenfranchisement of people, and then how that has often allied

178
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:46,320
itself with historical factors that are ongoing of racism, et cetera. That's what I'm proposing

179
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,520
to. Is it possible? And I'd like to try and explore that with you. But that's sort of

180
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,600
the frame I want to set up.

181
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:58,920
Yeah, I think for sure there's, I think there are a lot of things to deal with, and what you said, a

182
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:03,920
lot of things to kind of unpack at different levels. I think that maybe we can kind of separate

183
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:09,440
them in the in different parts so that we don't get completely jumbled. One is to look at the

184
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:18,800
possible reinterpretation of your experience, I'd say, or the notion of the original sin, then

185
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:24,720
the idea of Adam or the fall of Adam, what that can mean, and how we can reinterpret that in a

186
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:31,280
manner which is more useful than your traumatized youth. And I understand because I went through all

187
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:37,440
the stuff you dealt with, I went through the same. And even the description of like the idea of

188
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,600
blaspheming the Holy Spirit and everybody wondering, like, did I blaspheme the Holy Spirit? You

189
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:48,760
know, all of that, I understand. But I think there are ways to reappropriate the stories, those

190
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:53,440
stories. And I think we appropriate is I also believe one of the reasons why I went towards

191
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:59,840
orthodoxy is because they have a different vision of the fall of Adam, one which I think it has a

192
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:07,000
healthier balance. So that's one. And then the other is then looking also at the way in which these

193
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:17,760
protests or COVID and the protests together kind of just exploded into a kind of weird catharsis. And

194
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:24,760
what that means and what it's kind of looking towards. And so sadly, the third part, which would

195
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:29,880
be like how to get out of this kind of this bind that we're in is the one which I don't know.

196
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,600
Like I really, a lot of people ask me, so what should we do? And I'm looking around. And I think I

197
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:39,440
don't know what to do, except I don't know what to do socially. Like I think I know what to do

198
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,960
personally. But I don't think I know what the societal solution is. So maybe that one will be

199
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:48,760
harder. Well, but I do want to talk about that because I've been talking about that with other

200
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:56,280
people as well. So, but I'm happy with your proposal. But like I said, I'd like to put it, like

201
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:07,120
I said, into the way in which what's happening, it has, you know, at the level of the latent

202
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,640
functions, there's, well, you said it, I want to use your words, there's something dangerous

203
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:17,640
happening in this as well. And I want to explicate and draw that out. I'm happy to hear your

204
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:22,680
revisions. And so I don't know what to call it. Let's say revisioning rather than revision. Yeah,

205
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:29,720
of these, of these stories. And then, but if you could put that into dialogue with, because, okay,

206
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:34,240
let me, let me instead of making a statement, let me make, ask a question that's kind of a

207
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:46,800
request. I see in, you know, I see an analog to a strong analog in this movement to that version

208
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,040
of original sin that I was brought up with. And let's remember that the word Protestant means

209
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:56,920
those who protest. I mean, right there. And I was brought up in a church where, you know, protesting

210
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:03,040
and constantly declaring what was evil, and what should be burnt or, you know, and that that was

211
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:12,280
that was daily, the kind of practice. So do you think that I'm incorrect in saying that the version

212
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:16,880
of original sin, whether or not it's the right version, I'm going to give you space to talk about

213
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:23,240
that. But do you think that that that, you know, maybe overly Augustinian version of original

214
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:28,920
sin is what's at play in this movement right now? Am I incorrect about that?

215
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:33,720
No, I think you're definitely right. I think you're definitely right. One of the, and I think

216
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:39,680
it's something that we've seen before, in the sense that maybe an inverted version of what we've

217
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:46,840
seen before in terms of like racialized vision of the world in the past, which is that we've taken

218
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:54,080
the notion of original sin, and we've brought it down into biology, which is the scariest thing

219
00:17:54,120 --> 00:18:00,120
that can happen because it actually is inevitable. Like it actually does become inevitable because

220
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:05,960
it's related. It's linked in a, not in a really scientific way at all, but in a mythological

221
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:13,640
way, it's still brought into a term which is using language of kind of biological identity or

222
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:21,480
categories, which are material categories. And so the idea of this racialized guilt, or, you know,

223
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:29,120
was there in kind of 17th century racism, like kind of neo Darwinism, kind of social Darwinist

224
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:34,640
racism, this idea that, that certain races were inferior by their own biology and therefore were

225
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:41,000
made to be slaves or were made to be the lower. And now we're seeing a kind of weird reversal of

226
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:49,040
that, where we're saying to be a certain race is in itself to be the oppressor, like to be, to be

227
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:56,960
white, is to be guilty of the, the sin of the revolutionary thinking. Like, it's kind of like,

228
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:04,720
it's, it's not completely original sin. It's, it's like the end of the revolutionary trend in, in

229
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,760
thinking, right, the French revolution, the Marxist revolutions. And now we've come to kind of the

230
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:15,240
end of it, where we're actually bringing it into almost a biological reality, where the guilt of the

231
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:22,200
oppressor is a racial guilt. And it's, and that's, that's, so that, so like you said, it does relate

232
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:28,280
to original sin, because it means that as someone who has that identity, whether it's actually

233
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:32,640
legitimate, scientifically or not, it doesn't matter, they're still framed in those categories. As

234
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:39,360
someone who has that identity, I have no way out. Like I have no way out, except for two things,

235
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:47,640
which are people are doing, which is to self-flagellate and to scapegoat. That is to put myself

236
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:53,560
on the, to put myself on the side of find someone guiltier than me and yell at him and tell him that

237
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:58,760
he has to be canceled and he has to be excluded from society. The only, the only two solutions.

238
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:05,240
Yeah. And that, like I said, I went through periods where the church I was in would be

239
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:13,000
driven to bits by exactly that process repeatedly in cycles again and again and again. And when I

240
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,280
sort of, when I sort of woke up to that, I was like, Whoa, this is like, like, when I started

241
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:24,080
reading some literature and I realized that the literature like showed me what human beings

242
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,560
could be other than this, that was like, so.

243
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:33,600
But you're right. In the Protestant sense, like if you think of Protestant sex and you notice both

244
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:41,120
the Puritanist kind of self-flagellation of complete depravity, and then the systematic notion

245
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:47,120
that all of a sudden, the group I'm in is not pure enough. They're not close enough to the truth. They're

246
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:53,200
not, and then removing myself with a little, a smaller group, and then condemning those on the

247
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:59,280
outside as being, as it's like an acceleration. It's always been there. It's there in every, every

248
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,520
structure. Like we can talk about that, but there's an acceleration of it in the kind of

249
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:09,040
fragmentation of Protestantism. And we see it in intersectionality to an extent which becomes

250
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:14,240
completely absurd where, you know, at some point it's so obscure that most like regular people don't

251
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:19,680
even know what you're talking about when trans exclusive this and then trans inclusive. And we

252
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:23,760
don't, most people are like, I don't understand. And then it's, there's smaller and smaller

253
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:28,640
identities which are excommunicating other identities and you don't know what's going on.

254
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:34,960
Yeah. So I mean, that, to my mind, that is the meaning crisis on steroids or methamphetamine or

255
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:43,040
something. So what, and I think given the deeply deleterious effects which we're seeing, you and

256
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:47,280
I were talking just before we hit the record about, you know, we're seeing, you know,

257
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,280
you know, people are like, they're people that we're normally sort of very sane, like in our

258
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,840
personal relationships are moving more towards the fringe and they're filled with anxiety and

259
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:02,080
they're describing their experiences surreal. I think, you know, the deleterious facts of the

260
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:09,360
meeting crisis are being exacerbated by COVID and then perhaps by certain latent aspects of this.

261
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:17,680
But I wanted to give you the opportunity to make good on your promise that there's an alternative

262
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:23,760
way, there's an alternative way. And I mean, I'm interested in this both philosophically

263
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,840
and personally. I typically try not to get too personal in these conversations, but this one

264
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,760
has to be different for the reasons I've already articulated. And I'm putting my trust in you

265
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:41,200
about this. So that there's an alternative way of conceiving of the myth of original sin. And you

266
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,480
know, I use that word in not in a pejorative fashion. But and so what do you, what is that

267
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:52,880
alternative understanding to your mind? So the way to understand it is to clearly differentiate

268
00:22:52,880 --> 00:23:00,160
between sin and death. They're related, but they're they're different. And so in scripture,

269
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:06,720
it says the wages of sin is death, right? And there's an idea that even in the in the scripture,

270
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:12,400
it never says that we inherit the sin of Adam, it says that that we, because of Adam's sin, we are,

271
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:18,400
we are in death, like we are in the, in the, in the, in, we are living in a world of death.

272
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:25,600
And that's really the best way to, to understand it, which is that sin causes death. So you,

273
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:32,800
you have a purpose, you miss the mark. And that's, that's what death is. And so there's a,

274
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:38,080
there's a brokenness that you break the system breaks down as you miss the mark. And this is

275
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:43,680
happens at every level of reality, whether it's in your own life or in society or, or entirety of

276
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:50,800
the world. When, when something misses the mark, then there's a breakdown, which happens. Now we,

277
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:59,280
we inherit the breakdown of that, which is before us, right? We inherit death. So we are born in

278
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:04,320
families that have missed the mark. We are born of parents that have missed the mark. We are born

279
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:10,800
of systems that have missed the mark. And so because of that, we, we live in a world which

280
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:16,560
has an aspect of it, which is broken. We still have the aspiration of hitting the mark. And that's,

281
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:22,080
that's what kind of guides us and makes us want to live, but we have to live with the consequences

282
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:30,560
of that, of that, of that miss. And the difficulty is that when you're in a world of death, that is,

283
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:36,640
when you inherit the consequence of sin, so when your parents miss the mark, and they will, and we

284
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:43,760
know they do, you inherit that. And it makes it more difficult for you to hit the mark because you

285
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:50,640
have all the baggage which comes and you have inherited the, the, the patterns of being that

286
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:56,160
will make that worse, right? Which will, which will increase the brokenness, which will tend to

287
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:02,640
fragment. Okay. And so that's the manner in which we need to understand original sin. That's what

288
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:11,120
it is. It's the inheritance of brokenness. So, so that, and I hope, I hope you take this as a helpful

289
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:20,000
thing. That to me reminds me of, you know, certain interpretations of the Buddhist notion of karma,

290
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:27,360
that there are these patterns at work, and, and we, and we inherit them, and they affect our

291
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:33,440
behavior, and they cause suffering. And the way I sort of understood this, at least psychologically

292
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:40,720
and existentially is, as you said, you know, we, we pick up from others, our parents, our friends,

293
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,760
and our culture, we pick up, and that, you know, here's where historical racism does matter, right?

294
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:53,520
We pick up patterns that are shaping us and moving us in ways that are detrimental to our

295
00:25:53,600 --> 00:26:00,160
aspirations. Is that, is that a fair? Yeah, exactly. Yeah. But the idea is, the idea is,

296
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:07,280
of course, the very desire, the very aspiration that is the very possibility we have of conceiving

297
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:14,640
the good, and of seeing the point that we're aiming at, right, of, of seeing it in our view and,

298
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:24,720
and moving towards it, right, is, is the very, how can I say this, is the reminder that we are not,

299
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:30,480
that we don't fit in this broken world, that we are, that we are, we find dissatisfaction in the

300
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:36,240
brokenness. And so that's what causes our suffering. But it's also what, what can ultimately cause our

301
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:41,760
hope, because we see, we can see that we're not made, like there's something in us which

302
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:47,200
wants more than this brokenness and this, this world of death. There's something in us which is,

303
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:53,520
which can see that which we can aim towards, and which is the good, of course. And so that is really

304
00:26:53,520 --> 00:27:01,920
the, and so what, let's say what Christianity shows us, and like what Christ shows us, is that

305
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:12,720
the manner to reach the, the manner to reach the, the, the aim in the brokenness is to a certain

306
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:20,320
extent embrace death. And that's really the, that's the hardest thing is to embrace death consciously,

307
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:25,760
embrace the, the brokenness consciously. And therefore we're, we don't become slaves of that

308
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:30,800
brokenness, right, is to see your sins, to see the place where you miss the mark, instead of just

309
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:35,040
blaming your parents, because that's what you will want to do, right? You want to blame your parents,

310
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:40,000
you want to blame the system, and you're right to, because the system is broken. Your parents are

311
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,440
broken. Everything, there's an aspect of everything that's given to you, which is broken, not fully,

312
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:50,640
but there is an aspect of it, which is broken. And the solution is to, is to actually rather see

313
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:58,720
your own death, the places in you that you're, that you're dead and recapture the, the vision,

314
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:04,880
right, recapture the, the aim. So this, this brings me to a central question that I have

315
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,360
about this. Thank you for that. I think that was very helpful. So let's shift the discussion

316
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:15,760
onto mortality then. And the interesting thing, of course, and you're aware of this, I know,

317
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,920
in the Greek world is mortality has a, and Heidegger developed this a lot, it has a much more

318
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:24,720
encompassing notion to it. And then that'll help lead me to my question to you. You know, because

319
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:30,320
one of the great sins, and I think this is the right word in the Greek world is hubris, right,

320
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:40,000
which is to, in some sense, forget your mortality, right, and to think that you can, that, that you

321
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,840
can be a God. And, you know, and this is captured in great literature, you know, Conrad's Heart of

322
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:49,280
Darkness, which of course is now a contentious work, but nevertheless, Kurtz's big sin is hubris,

323
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:55,040
right? He forgets. And Marlowe's, Marlowe's heroism is he commits himself to his humanity,

324
00:28:55,040 --> 00:29:00,480
that he will preserve his mortality. And I've been talking to my son about this, because,

325
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:08,560
you know, he lives with me now, partially because of COVID. And, you know, I've been exposing him to

326
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:12,000
certain ideas, and he's going, but, you know, but I want certainty. And I'm saying, well,

327
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:18,880
you, yeah, but you can't, part of what being, you know, be embracing your mortality is to

328
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:24,320
realize that no matter how good your idea might be, you're ultimately a fallible human being,

329
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:30,400
you're finite. And he was like, but I don't like this. And I said, but your mortality isn't just,

330
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:36,240
right? And you'll see how this connects to what you said in a second. Your mortality isn't the fact,

331
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:41,760
you know, like in Tolstoy's Ivan Illich. Ivan Illich knew he was going to die, right? It's not,

332
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:47,200
it's not that. Your mortality is that, like you said, in some fundamental way, you know, we are

333
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:54,240
finite, we are broken, we are not gods. So, and I'm seeing this in my discussion with him, how do

334
00:29:54,240 --> 00:30:00,000
you, how do you, because I'm trying to work this with him as a father, getting people to embrace

335
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,640
their mortality is good, because it prevents inflation, it prevents hubris, it prevents, I

336
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:13,120
suppose it would prevent blasphemy too, from a Christian perspective. And as you said, it helps

337
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:20,480
people to not, not to fall into the error of, by criticizing others, I implicitly remove myself

338
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:29,760
from that criticism, right? I see all of that. How do we do that without the, without traumatizing them?

339
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:38,800
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, that was a bit of a garden path. No, no, I, I think there, I think there has

340
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:44,560
to be, look, I'm sorry that I'm going to say this, but I think that trauma is part of the

341
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:50,080
experience, like I think that death is, we don't want to be cruel, but we don't want to be cruel,

342
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:56,080
is what I'm saying. No, no, right. No, I understand, but death is, death is, is traumatic, like there

343
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:03,760
is a trauma in death. And so we need, like the, the church fathers and the, the ascetics,

344
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:08,320
they always say two things, they say, remember God and remember death. Like those are the two

345
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:12,160
things you need to remember. I always kind of joke around and say, you know, that's the, the

346
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:17,920
Christian version of, of like mindfulness, you know, it's like remember God, remember death, right?

347
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:24,640
And so the idea is that if you, if you are, if you kind of remain in your death,

348
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:30,240
that like you said, you avoid all the problems that you talked about. And the, the strange paradox

349
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:34,800
in Christianity is that by doing that, you actually do become God.

350
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:41,360
Yes. Like you, you, you actually do become deified ultimately if you do those two things, right?

351
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,880
But, but it's a non-inflationary. Exactly. And that's the kind of the paradox of,

352
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:53,760
it's the, the paradox of, of, of creation and the paradox of, of the Garden of Eden, which is that

353
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:00,560
if Adam had submitted to the will of God and not eaten of the fruit of the tree,

354
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:06,320
then God would have given him the fruit of the tree. That's the, that's the tradition, right?

355
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:11,280
That's what many saints have said. And not only that, but that, that would have been his access

356
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:15,120
to the tree of life, which would have been perfect communion with the divine. And so

357
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,240
it is in humility that we actually reach the highest.

358
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,840
Yes. It's interesting. I just read this morning, when I was doing my lecture,

359
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:29,040
Divina, a Rilke's passage where he talks about, we throw a ball into the infinite,

360
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:34,320
and then it returns to us differently. It returns to us heavier. And it's only in that,

361
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,480
in, in, in having done that, that we actually get to feel the true weight of things.

362
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,960
And it sounds like you're saying something very analogous to that.

363
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:51,760
So how do we avoid the trauma? All I can say is the idea is obviously to place the trauma

364
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:58,240
ultimately to place it in Christ. Like the ultimate trauma, right, is, is communion. Like

365
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:04,080
that's the ultimate trauma. If you really take communion seriously, you are engaging in a

366
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:12,000
traumatic experience. You are eating the flesh and blood of the God man. Like you are, you are

367
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,320
at the foot of horror. Like, you know, you talk about horror a lot in your, in your, in your,

368
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:22,720
in your lectures. And I, one of the things I do want to bring up to you is that that is why

369
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:27,920
communion, one of the aspects of communion is to bring you into that horror in a manner which

370
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:32,880
will, which will save you and not destroy you, right? In a manner in which you can integrate it

371
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:39,840
in, that it's both a participation in horror and a communion of love at the same time in a

372
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:45,440
paradoxal way. Yeah. I mean, well, maybe we can talk about this at some point. I mean, I do think

373
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:52,800
the other sacred brings in simultaneously the symbol on, right? The horrific, the horrifying

374
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:59,520
function and the homing function in a profound way. And that, that goes back to, so, I mean,

375
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:06,480
there's two things I want to say. One is like, I'm trying to, but there's a, there's a notion of

376
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:12,480
mortality and isn't it in the symbolism of carrying your cross that's analogous to the

377
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:19,840
Buddhist notion that mortality isn't just death, but that the idea that moment by moment, I'm dying.

378
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:25,280
There's, there's little deaths all the time. And that if I try to avoid that, if I try to

379
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:32,320
get some kind of permanent hold on things, I'm, I'm, I'm just going to, I'm going to cut myself

380
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:38,240
on that. And then I'm going to cut other people. It's, again, is that, is that a, is that a

381
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:42,960
correct analogy? Yeah, of course. Yeah. Like if you look at, if you look at the prayer of Jesus,

382
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:47,920
the, the basic mystical prayer of the church, it has two, it has two parts, right? It says,

383
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:55,120
it has an invocation. It says, Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me as center. And so

384
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:59,680
it's like, there's this invocation and this remembrance of my own brokenness, remembrance

385
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:05,680
of my own incapacity. And so those two movements simultaneously, they're the ones that will,

386
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:13,840
and it's, and it's, it's also, and because I think one of the problems of the, of the trauma

387
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:20,320
of the Protestant is to a certain extent, the idea that it's weird, like the idea that you

388
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:27,120
should be pure, right? That you should be, but you can't. And so it's like, what, then what,

389
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:34,560
what do you do, right? You just remain in this strange broken, broken self. But if you rather

390
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:42,160
see it as this, this necessary part of being a human person and moving towards the good, then

391
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:48,640
it, then it's not as traumatic because you, you will then see that even the saints lived in,

392
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:53,920
you know, in the most difficult temptations that the saints were struggling with their passions,

393
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:01,120
you know, and those who reached the highest had the same frustrations you did. Like they, no one

394
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:06,000
pretends to be, if you, there isn't like the holier, the person that's holier than now. And

395
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,200
that kind of just, if you read the lives of the saints, you see the story of broken people who

396
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:16,480
their whole life struggle with thoughts and with temptations, you know, and are delivered by God.

397
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:21,280
But it's like, okay, if they struggled, so for 30 years, you know, you read, you read crazy stories

398
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:26,400
of the saints where it's like, for 40 years, he struggled with the thought of, of fornication.

399
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:31,680
And it's like, would he struggle with that for 40 years? He actually struggled actively with that

400
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:36,320
for 40 years. Okay, so I need to stop complaining because seriously, I'm, there's no way that I'm

401
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:46,160
doing that. So, Johan talks about this in connection with Plato and Socrates, he talks about it in

402
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:51,520
terms of, he has a book called, Finite Transcendence, where he said that, but Theta was always

403
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:59,600
trying to keep this tension alive between the relationship to transcendence and the acceptance

404
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:08,240
of our finitude, of our mortality. And so I'm wondering then, if there is something like

405
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,920
a feature of wisdom, I know you have your particular Christian commitments, and I'm not

406
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:18,640
trying to trespass on those, but you're also not, you're not, you're not being offended,

407
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:22,960
which I thank you for when I make these connections to other, other things, you find them, I think,

408
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:28,960
valuable, at least in discussion, but make, there seems to be a feature of wisdom, which is this

409
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:37,920
kind of tonus between, right, the aspiration in transcendence, and then the deep acceptance

410
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:45,120
of our humanity and our mortality, and keeping them always together is, and there's a finesse to

411
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:51,200
that, there's a dynamic shift, I can't give you a rule or a recipe for doing that, it's an ongoing,

412
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:56,320
ever-evolving capacity, would you, would you, would you think that? Yeah, it's a motive, it's a motive

413
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:01,280
being, it's a way of being, which is what will kind of hold those two things together, and I think

414
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:07,360
your image of wisdom is particularly good in the sense that wisdom, at least in Scripture, at

415
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:12,320
in the Bible, the way that wisdom is described, seems to really be the capacity for those,

416
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:19,520
for, let's say, the, the, the principles or the ideals to be united with the particular,

417
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:25,200
like that seems to be, you know, it's like, the wisdom always comes as like advice on how to,

418
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:29,360
you know, how to find the good woman, or how to, how to live your life, how to deal with money,

419
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:34,720
like that's how wisdom comes, but what it's, it's patterning something which is, which is above,

420
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:40,800
you know. Yeah, Aristotle has that with Sophia and fromesis being brought together, right? Sophia is

421
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:45,360
your grasping of these universal and profound principles, and then fromesis is how do you

422
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:50,480
make them contextually relevant in a contextually sensitive manner. So this now brings me back around

423
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:58,400
then. It sounds like this, this deeper reflection on, well, let's use the word sin for now, this

424
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:06,640
deeper reflection on sin, you know, affords us what might be missing in what we're seeing

425
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:14,800
in the demonstration, that, that, and this, this is part of my concern, that you talk about the,

426
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:21,600
the, you know, inclusion as the sole value. I talked about something similar in that,

427
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:28,800
that justice is the sole virtue and a very truncated sense of justice. The Greek sense of

428
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:34,320
justice was always simultaneously external with others and internal with oneself. That's really

429
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:39,520
clear. And what we have is a completely, we get none, we get a reduction of all the virtues to

430
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:45,360
justice and then just the, the social aspect of justice, hence the name, social justice.

431
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:51,360
Yeah, we're not sure exactly what, what that justice entails in terms of its particular,

432
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:54,960
like how it's going to manifest. Well, and that goes to the point I want to make, because

433
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:01,360
I, I, I, I have a concern that we are losing the other virtues. I mean, the Greeks had at

434
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:06,080
least the cardinal four, and then the Christians had the next, the sacred three. And so we at

435
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:10,720
least had, we at least have seven, we should be talking about, right? We at least have seven,

436
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:15,200
we should be talking about. And we were just talking about one, one of the ones that's considered

437
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:22,000
something like a meta virtue, which is wisdom. You know, I shared the, what I think one interpretation

438
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:28,240
of Socrates, that Socrates saw that each virtue was a way of being wise in a particular situation.

439
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:34,480
The virtues aren't separate things, particular ways of enacting. And so to me, if that argument is

440
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:40,080
good, and I think it's a good argument, talking about justice without having concern for wisdom

441
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:45,600
seems to me to be like really, really almost oxymoronic. It seems to be

442
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:52,720
self-contradictory, self-undermining. And that's a very dangerous kind of thing to be for human

443
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:58,800
beings to be embracing, embracing, committing yourself deeply to something that is self-undermining

444
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:03,840
in its foundations is a very problematic thing to do. What do you think about that?

445
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:11,680
No, I totally agree. And that's why it's one of the reasons, because the idea of the idea of justice,

446
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:18,400
it seems to have something to do with equality, although it's ill-defined as well. Like,

447
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:23,040
what exactly do we mean by equality and what, because obviously equality is a strange term,

448
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:28,800
because you need a, you need a category to declare equality, because you can't have equality in

449
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:34,160
everything, because then everything would just be the same. So equality is a complicated term,

450
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:38,640
and so it seems like, you know, it's like, what is it, the intersectional, it's like the diversity,

451
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:43,920
equity, inclusion, right? That's the, those are the three kind of values that kind of mesh together

452
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:52,080
in this idea of justice. And so the difficulty is, of course, that the, like the revolutionary

453
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:57,600
aspect of it is what you also talk about in the sense of it undermining itself,

454
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:03,040
it ends up eating itself, and it ends up eating itself by its very mechanism, which is that

455
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:10,000
I hate to say it this way, but it's, it's, it's inevitable to come to the fact that there is no

456
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:16,720
such thing as equality, right? In terms of actual, totally equality, right? Because it does, what,

457
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:20,640
what does it mean? Like, everybody's smarter, stupider than others, some are taller, some are

458
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:24,480
shorter, you know, and, and, and it, it's individually true, and it's true in different

459
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,800
categories and different cities, and it's like, there's difference, you know, you can't have

460
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:36,400
equality. And so this like weird desire for equality ends up being, ends up being a kind of

461
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:41,520
power play, it seems, not, not really a desire for equality, but a desire for power.

462
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:46,400
So, so I wonder if there's something going on here, kind of displacement, because,

463
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,960
and this, this is going to be really, you have to move very carefully here.

464
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:01,520
So, so I think what people want to do, sorry, that sounds pompous, but it's hard to talk.

465
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:08,080
It seems, it seems plausible to me to propose that what people want to do is reduce

466
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:17,680
the suffering of pain and distress. And then they, and then they, they have, they're making a claim

467
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:26,960
that most suffering or distress, or maybe all, right, is caused by inequality. And of course,

468
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:34,880
there is truth to that. Yeah. What we, you know, when resources are not being distributed as fairly

469
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:39,680
as they can, and fairness is not the same thing as equality, this is part of the problem, right,

470
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:43,200
because justice is also supposed to be about fairness, not just about equality.

471
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:53,200
And so when we do cause, we cause unnecessary suffering. So, so, so let me try and give you

472
00:43:53,200 --> 00:44:06,080
a bit of a sprite riff on this. I see the left as really sensitive to the fact that human beings

473
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:11,840
are, I'll use a Greek term here, but you'll find a Christian analog, I'm sure, that human beings

474
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:16,480
are really subject to fate, that there is just shitty things that happen to human beings because

475
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:20,000
they're finite and they're limited, and the world is an overwhelming machine and there's

476
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,880
historical forces and material forces, you know, you might even say powers and principalities that

477
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:31,040
work, right? And people are just subject, right? And that we have to do, and that people therefore

478
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:37,520
deserve our aid, even if they haven't earned it. Because if we don't do that, we are, and this is

479
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:42,240
like the aspect of sin again, we're ignoring the fact that we are finite and we are subject to

480
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:47,120
forces beyond our control. The left gets that, and I think the right tends to forget that,

481
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:54,080
and that's why the right often comes off as cruel. But what the left forgets is what the right is,

482
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:59,920
no matter how, you know, how haphazardly they do it and stupidly they do it, is the right tries to

483
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:05,600
remind people that even though we are subject to fate and people should be aided beyond what

484
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:11,440
they deserve or have earned, right? Human beings are nevertheless also responsible. They need to

485
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:17,520
cultivate virtue, because every human being is beset by self-deception. And the only person that

486
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:22,720
can get out of self-deception, I can't get you out of your own self-deception. I can give you

487
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:28,800
guides, but you have to go through it. Like you have to go through it. I can't do that for you,

488
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:34,320
right? So to put it in a slogan, you know, the left remembers fate and forgets virtue and the

489
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:45,360
right remembers virtue and forgets fate. And so what I'm trying to get at is how could we change

490
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:51,920
this discussion about justice so that we could put it back into what it was supposed to be paired with,

491
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:59,120
which was suffraging, right? We pursued the external justice of trying to reduce the suffering of

492
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:05,120
others that are caused by history and fate has to always be counterbalanced by Sopherson,

493
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:13,040
the cultivation of the inner justice of virtue. And for the Greeks, it was axiomatic

494
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:17,920
that you had to talk about those two things together. Somehow we have gotten to the point

495
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:22,880
where we only talk about one side of this. And I find that also a very lopsided thing. Sorry,

496
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:28,800
that was a long thing to say, but you're a deep thinker. I want to give you a lot to wrestle with.

497
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:35,200
Yeah. Well, it seems like the way that at least when I look at the way that things happen in the

498
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:41,920
Bible and kind of the way that emphasis that Christianity has put on it is obviously, Christianity

499
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:48,320
is obviously very, very preoccupied with the poor, preoccupied with the poor in the broadest way you

500
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:55,280
can interpret that. And those that have less, those that have little, whether it's, you know,

501
00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:01,280
whether it's the poor in terms of their own, let's say spiritual poor, or it's poor even

502
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:06,320
physically in terms of their material poor, or it's the sick, or it's those that have no recourse,

503
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:12,320
like the widow and the orphan. This is something that Christianity is extremely concerned about.

504
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:21,120
But the way that Christianity seems to have concerned itself about it mostly is to ask

505
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:28,480
those who have to give, to put responsibility on those who have to care for those

506
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:38,160
who need to be cared for, rather than tell those who are lacking to go get theirs,

507
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:44,240
right? To take it from those who have it. And that's really the difference between

508
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:49,680
the revolutionary mindset and the Christian mindset. And some people might say, well, why

509
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:55,680
why can't it happen? Like why can't those that have less just take, right? Take it back.

510
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:00,960
And the reason is because, the reason is very practical reason. It's because it's a

511
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:07,280
self-defeating pattern. The pattern which will, which will destroy itself because there's always

512
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:11,760
someone who has less than you. And there's always someone who will be there to take from you, even

513
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:16,000
though you think you are the one, you're the one who has less. And so you take from that one above

514
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,760
you, but there's always someone below you who has less than you and will take from you. And

515
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:26,640
as soon as you take from that one above you, the power especially, then you become the one who is

516
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:32,960
now in the, you know, who's going to be shot. Like the story of Robespierre is obviously the

517
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:38,320
most classic example of that happening. And so that seems to be the way that Christianity deals

518
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:45,600
with it. And there are consequences if you don't. And the consequences need to be kind of put in

519
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:52,960
the right position. The way I kind of say it is, I don't excuse the peasants for killing the king,

520
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:01,200
right? But I still think it's partly the king's fault, right? It's still, it's still because

521
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:06,160
the king didn't care for the peasants that the peasants ended up killing him. And I'm not justifying

522
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:11,600
the peasants actions, but I am saying that if you don't care for the poor, at some point,

523
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:18,160
it's going to happen. Like the, the, the people will come and take theirs if you don't care for

524
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:22,320
them, but it's not morally justified that they do. I don't know if that makes sense.

525
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:28,400
No, it does. I get what you're saying. But what I was, what I was trying to, well, maybe this

526
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:34,720
is the way of bringing it back. Like, I'm trying to get to this notion that isn't just about equality

527
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:38,960
or even equity. I'm trying, like, yeah, you know, you're right. Jesus does,

528
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:46,080
both, you see Jesus and the Buddha, both. And they, what's interesting is they both do this.

529
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:53,920
They both criticize equally something like cruelty and something like hypocrisy, right? And so

530
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:58,720
what I'm saying is the, the, what we're trying to bring in here as we're trying to encompass

531
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:06,160
the nature of human beings is that the notion of social justice, especially if it becomes

532
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:12,080
just the pursuit of equality, does not have the machinery to deal with it. Jesus and the Buddha

533
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:17,440
are neither left nor right. Like, it doesn't make sense to talk, right? Yeah, exactly.

534
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:24,400
It doesn't make sense at all. Exactly. Right. And so the point is, in a very profound way,

535
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:29,520
it's not that they're non-political, but they're, if you'll allow me, they're metapolitical. Oh,

536
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:35,760
yeah. Right. They're trying to get at what, what are the values or the virtues people should be

537
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:41,040
aspiring to that are the most responsible, and I mean both senses of the word responsible,

538
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:48,320
to human nature, right? That's what I see them doing. And that's what I'm not seeing in this

539
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:53,840
movement. I'm not seeing the wisdom of, you know, like we said, of trying to balance these

540
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:59,120
things together of getting a deep understanding of human nature. I'm, I'm hearing a very, very

541
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:07,760
superficial theory about human nature and human history and human culture. And, and, and I don't

542
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:14,960
think that the version of justice, justice is, what really concerns me is this version of justice,

543
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:20,560
it sounds so easy. And, and that means, that to me means it's got to be wrong, because I mean,

544
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:25,120
what I get from all the great philosophers is justice, real justice. I mean, John Rawls writes

545
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:31,680
this huge book, right? Like real justice is hard. It's really hard because human beings

546
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:36,640
are so incredibly complex. And they have, as we've been talking about here, these, you know,

547
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:44,080
these opposing forces and polls at work in them. That was a point I was trying to make, sorry.

548
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:48,800
You're totally right. And I think that, like, if you look at this, if you look at how Christ deals

549
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:54,480
with it, it's interesting, because, you know, we talked about responsibility. And you can see that

550
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:58,320
in, you can see the way that Christ talks about, like he talks to the Pharisees, and he says you're

551
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:03,680
a bunch of hypocrites. And he, he talks to woe to the rich, if you don't care for the poor,

552
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:09,600
and woe to, you know, and blessed are those who are poor for they will receive and all of this,

553
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:15,120
like there's all this and this, but he also has several parables where he talks about the poor,

554
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:20,160
who don't care for what they have, and the consequences of that. Like he also has that he

555
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:25,120
also has the parable of the talents where he talks about the servant who receives something and doesn't

556
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:30,800
make it fruitful and therefore has to face the consequences of not making fruitful that's what

557
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:36,000
she has. And so Christ talks of talks at all levels at the same time. You know, I always say, like

558
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:41,760
you said, he's metapolitical. He's a judge and a victim. He's the king and the servant. He's all

559
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:47,360
these things at the same time, in a very paradoxal way. And so he kind of transcends politics. And

560
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:52,960
it's interesting to watch politicians, the politically minded, because they see in Christ

561
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:58,720
a kind of weird mirror of themselves. So the people on the left see Christ as a kind of revolutionary

562
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:05,520
figure. And the people on the right see Christ as a get your act together type figure. And it's like,

563
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:10,480
well, you know what, there's neither of those really. Yeah, I think that was very well said,

564
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:19,680
Jonathan. So what to do with this, what to do with this, this weird, the way that I think the way

565
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:24,320
to understand it, and you know, you talked a little bit in our before our conversation started

566
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:29,280
about the inevitability of religio. And I think that's really the way that's exactly where I

567
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:35,440
wanted to go. This whole discussion seems to be pointing, right? It's making a very, I think,

568
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:41,840
plausible argument about the inevitability of religio, the unavoidability of religio in

569
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:47,760
human endeavor. And you made, and human existence, and you made this point, and I wanted to give

570
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:53,920
you the opportunity to expand on it. You made a point of criticizing the new atheists, you know,

571
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:59,920
in how they were sort of saying, if we could just get rid of religion, you know, and what they did

572
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:06,000
is, you know, they identified religion with a, you know, belief in the supernatural, etc, etc.

573
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:11,120
And if we just got rid of those false beliefs, then that would be it. And then your point is, well,

574
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:15,280
the people that are in these marches, they're not advocating anything necessarily supernatural,

575
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:19,280
something perhaps transcendent, but not supernatural, etc. They're not doing all,

576
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:24,320
but nevertheless, look at the religious behavior, look at how comprehensive and powerful it is,

577
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:29,520
and look at how much it's a response to the way the COVID crisis accelerated the meaning crisis.

578
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:35,040
And you made that, and it was sort of a very brief thing. It was about two or three minutes in the

579
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:39,200
video, but I wanted to give you, and I think this is a good context, you and I, in discussion,

580
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:45,360
I wanted to give you the opportunity to expand on that. Yeah. Well, my criticism of the new

581
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:49,920
atheists, you know, and I would use Stephen Pinker as the, as the main example, just because of

582
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,960
the kinds of books he've written and the kind of statements he's made about

583
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:57,280
enlightenment and this kind of progress and everything, is that,

584
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:03,520
and I think that what you're doing is, is a much better, like the COGSI approach and the

585
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:08,960
cognitive science approach is a much better approach to this, because there is, there is

586
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:14,880
an understanding of what a human being is in a, in a deeper way. And, and there's an understanding

587
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:20,160
of the reasons why we have certain patterns and the reason why certain things exist within us.

588
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:26,560
And what, what the new atheist team to want to do is to see the advantage of reason,

589
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:32,720
and then want to kind of box the human being in reason, and see everything which is outside of

590
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:38,080
reason as the thing to get rid of, as the bad thing to get rid of. There's our original sin,

591
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:42,640
is everything that's outside of reason needs to be eliminated. But the problem is that you

592
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:48,160
can't eliminate it. You know, and, and there's a kind of weird utopian vision, and the example I

593
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:55,040
always use is the example of sleep. You could say, and reason and, and, and awakenness, you know,

594
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:59,440
and the idea of kind of this more, this other aspect of us in sleep, it's a good way to understand

595
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:05,280
it. It's as if I told you, you could be way more productive, if you didn't sleep. Like you just

596
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:08,800
have to not sleep, and then you could be awake all the time. And wouldn't that be amazing? Like

597
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:12,400
then you would imagine how much progress you would make, like imagine how far you would go,

598
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:17,920
if you would just stay awake all the time. But the reality is that you can't. That's not just,

599
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:24,000
not part of being a human being. And so these other patterns that we have are there. And so,

600
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:29,120
and they're extremely important. And if you try to get rid of them, what they do is they kind of,

601
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:33,840
they go down for a little while, and then they come back like a monster, and then we'll swallow

602
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:39,120
you. And that's what we're, those are the kinds of things we saw in the, in the French Revolution,

603
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:46,000
in the Russian Revolution, all the kind of end of atheist cycle where all of a sudden the patterns

604
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:51,280
come back like a big monster to devour you. And now we're seeing very similar things as well.

605
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:58,400
We're seeing a secular religious manifestation. And it's akin to the one we saw in the French

606
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:03,760
Revolution. And it's akin to the one we saw in the Russian Revolution. And so, and I always want

607
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:10,000
to say, it's like the people who kind of made fun of Jordan Peterson talking about this, it's like,

608
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:15,360
it's happening right now. It's happening right now. Look at what's going on. And you can just

609
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:21,360
poo poo it. You can toss it to the side, but it's the same pattern happening again. And the reason

610
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:29,440
for the pattern is the same, like the denial of, sorry, I get excited and I throw myself.

611
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:37,840
Me too, me too. The denial of certain aspects of the human person is going to come back.

612
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:44,240
And so the idea is what do you do? Like how do you deal with it? And to me, that's why I think that

613
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:51,920
that's why I think that having a conscious religious aspect to you, that's why ritual,

614
00:57:52,720 --> 00:58:01,120
conscious ritual is important because ritual will be there. You can't avoid it. Now the question is

615
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:07,120
whether or not it's part of you integrated or whether or not you're a slave to ritualized behavior

616
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:13,360
and kind of scapegoat and identity forming behavior that is just part of existence.

617
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:20,240
I think that was very beautifully said. Yeah, I agree. I think on the first point you made,

618
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:24,800
but the COGSI and all the stuff on relevance realization and those aspects that are

619
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:32,160
pre-rational and how primordial they are and the importance of ritual. So for those of you,

620
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:36,000
I mean, you're watching this video, you know this work. And so there's arguments there and

621
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,680
thank you, Jonathan, for gesturing to them. And then as you were building on that,

622
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:44,400
I thought of this scene and you'll probably be able to riff on this because it's a mythology,

623
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:48,480
it's from a science fiction classic, you know, Journey to the Center of the Earth.

624
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:53,040
And especially in the movie version, Count Sacknessen, who's the villain,

625
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:58,960
you'll see how this connects in just a sec. They come to him and they say, well,

626
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:05,200
don't you sleep? And he said, I never sleep. I hate those little slices of death. And he

627
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:10,320
represents exact, no, just, right, so the journey to the center of the earth, which of course has

628
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:16,560
all kinds of mythic, you know, meanings attached to that, right? But he's the villain. And notice

629
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:22,080
how he brings together like your analogy and how it connects back to an unwillingness to accept his

630
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:29,760
humanness, his mortality, the hubris in here. And that cycles us back again to this refusal to accept

631
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:37,280
our humanity. It's ultimately, it's again the same kind of, it's a puritanical kind of refusal

632
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:47,600
to accept our humanity in a profound hubristic way. And that, and that I think is what, when I've

633
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:53,760
talked to people, you know, who have sort of come out of the New Atheist movement,

634
00:59:55,360 --> 01:00:01,440
one of the things that they'll often say that started putting them off was they got a sense of

635
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:10,800
arrogance attached to these people. And, you know, and I'm not talking about, and part of it is no

636
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:16,320
doubt personality. There's narcissism and, but I think they might also have been putting out their

637
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:27,840
finger on this, this sense that, right, there are aspects of our humanity that are not being given

638
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:33,120
due. And this is what I mean again about justice, soffers and justice. Plato had this sense that

639
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:39,680
you had to give all of the parts of the human their due. They had to be given their due regard,

640
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:48,320
their due role, their due place. The attempt to eradicate was a deep mistake, right? And,

641
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:54,720
and, right. And so this, this, the soffers and the inner justices, we have to give due regard

642
01:00:54,720 --> 01:01:02,400
and due place and due role for all aspects of our humanity. If you look at, if you look at the very

643
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:08,560
first commandment or the very first place in scripture where it talks about something which is

644
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:15,840
holy is in the description of creation. And so you have six days, then you have the seventh day,

645
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:21,200
which is the day of rest. And it's the day which is set aside for God, right? It's the holy day.

646
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:26,960
And, and right there in Genesis, it says that's why we, we follow the Sabbath. Now that there's a

647
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:33,200
mystery in that, which is very profound. And the mystery is that it's exactly the mystery that the

648
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:39,360
New Atheists are impotent and capable of seeing, which is that the way that the world is made and

649
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:44,480
the way that consciousness is made and the way that reason is made is because it's a patterning

650
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:51,680
system. It can never encompass everything, right? It, it can be coherent, but it cannot be complete.

651
01:01:52,320 --> 01:02:01,280
And you need to leave a bit out for completeness to manifest itself, like in its, in its mystery.

652
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:08,800
So you need to leave a bit on the edge that is not closed, that isn't tied up, that isn't

653
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:13,760
accounted for. There has to be some aspects which are not accounted for. If you try to

654
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:20,960
account for everything, that's the, you know, that's the, that's the, the most dangerous thing,

655
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:26,720
right? It's the, and if you also try to see that which is accounted for as totality,

656
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:32,480
which is the sin of Satan, which is the sin of pride, which is the sin of Adam, that's the hubris.

657
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:38,640
And then, then you fall because that aspect which you, which you, which you, which is supposed to

658
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:46,400
be unaccounted for, which you're trying to ignore is still there, right? And, and the, the fascinating

659
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:53,600
aspect of that margin or the, the, let's say the seventh day is that there are, it has two parts

660
01:02:53,600 --> 01:03:03,280
to it. It has a part which is the, the unfathomable of creation, right? The, the, the completeness of

661
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:09,840
creation, but it also points to the infinite. There's a secrecy in it, which also points to the

662
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:16,160
infinite, which is why it's both the day of rest, but also the day set aside for God at the same time.

663
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:19,680
So it's both death and the source of life at the same time.

664
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:25,360
That's very interesting. Your invocation of Godel, I mean, I take Godel's theorem that you

665
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:31,920
can't have a both complete and consistent to be an example of what I meant earlier by mortality.

666
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:37,440
That's the mortality in the heart of any epistemological project or, you know, Heisenberg's

667
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:43,120
uncertainty. That's the mortality in the, in the, in the heart of any empirical observation or

668
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:50,640
investigation and, and more and more of these, right? And the, the, the, the history and philosophy

669
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:54,880
of the last two centuries have been in philosophy of science, at least the more philosophical aspects

670
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:59,840
of science have been the, been the discovery of this. I'd like your invocation of it because

671
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:03,760
it brings me back around and, you know, and you, I, you, you may, I don't know if you're doing

672
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:08,800
it deliver it a little off, but you're invoking, I heard Levinas when you were comparing totality

673
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:12,800
to infinity because he has a book around that, right? And how infinity is not the same thing as

674
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:17,520
totality. Because totality is the pretense that you have both consistency and completeness.

675
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:22,560
That's my way of understanding it. And, and therefore it, like, if you take the Goli, Goli,

676
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:29,760
Goli's argument seriously, and you should, right, that is always a dangerous pretense.

677
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:37,200
And that the problem with any, any system that claims to be complete and consistent is that it

678
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:46,480
is actually a deep form of self deception. Oh yeah. That's for sure. So I mean, and this is what,

679
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:50,880
you know, this was, this is the great for all of the criticisms I have of them. This is the great

680
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:56,160
thing that comes out of the whole pragmatism movement of James and Pierce and Dewey and more

681
01:04:56,160 --> 01:05:01,440
recent people, you know, like Quine and Davidson. And they've had a deep influence on me. I haven't

682
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:05,600
had a chance to talk about them very much. I will in another series. But the point I'm trying to get

683
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:12,960
to here is, like, there's a, there's a shadow side of the utilitarianism. There's a negative version

684
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:18,800
of it, which is strategies of eradication, because eradication is an attempt to be completely

685
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:24,240
consistent and complete. So there's an argument, and I'm not advocating for all of his ideas,

686
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:28,880
but I just want to give due credit. Coleman Hughes makes this argument about, look,

687
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:34,800
we all agree that murder is a deeply immoral act. And I'm not playing around with terms. Well,

688
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:39,280
sometimes you kill, but when we say killing that's not immoral, we don't call it murder. Murder is

689
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:44,000
the name for the killing we regard as immoral. So let's not play that game. So we guard murder as

690
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:50,320
immoral, but we don't pursue an eradication strategy in our society. Because if we were to

691
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:58,560
eradicate, try to eradicate murder, we would so, we would so subject ourselves to a radically

692
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:07,200
dehumanizing totalitarian state that, and that's why no culture anyway doesn't, right? Every culture

693
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:12,560
has prohibitions against murder. There's variations on it, of course, but you don't see them saying,

694
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:15,920
and what we're going to do is we're going to set things up so that murder is impossible.

695
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:18,320
You know, Philip, that's a Philip K. Dick kind of situation.

696
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:22,800
Oh yeah, it's a scary thing. No, and you're right about the strategies of eradication.

697
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:31,200
These are extremely frightening because they tend towards exactly what you're talking about.

698
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:36,400
And I'm afraid that I see the same, you know, and I'm afraid that I'm seeing that right now

699
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:43,440
with COVID. I'm seeing exactly a falling into a strategy of eradication where we think that we

700
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:54,080
cannot continue to live until this virus ceases to exist. This is not how it works. This is a

701
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:59,520
dangerous because the method you will use to eradicate the virus, the totalitarian method

702
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:06,480
you will use will be extremely harmful. They will be very, very harmful to our health,

703
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:11,440
to our community, all of these things. And it's like the difficulty that you understand

704
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:16,960
the desire to eradicate because it's a bad thing, right? This virus is a bad thing. You want it to

705
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:22,960
go away, but once you enter into that strategy of eradication, especially with techno states,

706
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:31,280
where you are develop the power to push that capacity of eradication to limit that we're

707
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:38,240
not seen before, it's a very, very frightening situation. A clear example of that is the proposal

708
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:45,120
that we start tracking everybody's movement, every movement. I say people, do you really want the

709
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:50,480
state to have that power? Do you really want the state to have that power? Do you really want the

710
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:55,280
corporations to have that power? They already have that power to some degree and they use it to

711
01:07:55,280 --> 01:08:03,600
manipulate you. Look, I can't believe it. I saw a BBC article just a few days ago and it was just

712
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:07,760
like a regular article where they're talking about what the future of travel will look like.

713
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:15,120
And in their description of the future of travel, they talked about vaccines with identification

714
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:21,520
in the vaccine that they can scan your body so that you, and this was a BBC article. It wasn't

715
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:25,840
a conspiracy article. It wasn't like someone, it was like, this is what travel is going to look

716
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:31,520
like. They'll scan your body to know whether or not you have the vaccine and they'll let you

717
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:38,640
participate in social things depending on whether or not they can track you. It's like, my goodness,

718
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:43,440
don't you watch science fiction movies? I don't know. Am I the only one who watch

719
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:50,320
science fiction movies? Well, I watch them too. So, I mean, and we have to be careful here. So,

720
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:56,880
COVID is very bad. Oh, yeah. No, no, no, I want to make an analogy here. COVID is very bad and you

721
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:03,200
should try as much as we can ameliorate it, but with wisdom, toggling against over empowering the

722
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:09,680
state and taking a dehumanized view or a simplistic view of human nature in order to

723
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:15,360
achieve it. So, we don't push for eradication. We push for amelioration that doesn't cost us too

724
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:22,160
much our humanity. Isn't that the same attitude we should take for how to deal with the very

725
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:29,360
real evil of racism that we should try which, and we should continue to try to ameliorate it?

726
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:34,640
But we shouldn't, you know, I talk a lot about how you frame the problem. It is way more important

727
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:42,240
the method about actually solving it. Should we be adopting a mindset that is a totalitarian

728
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:48,720
kind of eradication about something like racism? It strikes me that argument by analogy means

729
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:55,600
there is a sense in which we can go too far on this. And that doesn't, I hope, that doesn't make

730
01:09:55,600 --> 01:10:00,960
me a racist. And what I've seen is I saw the interview with Don Lemon and I forget the name

731
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:07,520
of the actor and he was trying to say, he's a black guy. And he's trying to say, I'm just saying

732
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:13,920
that some of the leaders of the movement are going too far to extreme. That's all he was proposing

733
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:21,680
and he was treated with smugness and dismiss and then this horrible argument by Lemon.

734
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:27,680
Well, people accuse Martin Luther King of being too extreme as if, well, are you saying that

735
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:32,240
because sometimes people have misused that word that every time they use it, they're misusing it?

736
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:38,080
That's a really stupid argument. Can we have a better argument, please? And it's like, if we

737
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:46,000
can't even bring up the question that we might be framing the attempt to achieve a goal, a lot of

738
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:51,200
a goal that I fully support, then I think we're in a very, very bad place. I think we're getting

739
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:58,080
into a very bad place. Yeah. And you're right. Because one of the things COVID did was awaken

740
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:07,680
in us this pattern of infection. And it awakened in us the pattern of infection and the desire

741
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:15,760
to exclude and eradicate. And now it's being politicized. Not the COVID. It's weird because

742
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:24,080
you can see that there's no narrative connection between COVID and Floyd, but there is a pattern

743
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:29,920
connection. And you can see that it's awakened the pattern and now it's playing out in the political

744
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:35,200
sphere. Well, I mean, isn't that a case? Again, I'm talking at the latent level, not at the

745
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:40,880
manifest label, but that seems like a case, a clear case of what a psychodynamic person would

746
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:47,840
call displacement. COVID puts you like you're suddenly in the Old Testament. I don't mean

747
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:52,240
that pejoratively. But you have this ubiquitous, threatening things out there in the world,

748
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:58,720
and you have to adopt this very insular purity code. And then you don't know when it's going

749
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:10,320
to strike you. And then it might be infected. But now what we can do is we couldn't do anything

750
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:14,480
about the COVID, but I think what your suggestion is, but I can do something about this over here.

751
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:21,680
Can do something about, yeah. And the danger of the racist thing is the limit of it, because the

752
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:28,000
limit is the problem with racism is that it's this invisible thing in the sense that it ends up being

753
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:34,480
thoughts and feelings in people. And the idea that you can reprogram someone and that you can

754
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:39,680
move towards the eradication of thoughts and feelings. I mean, we know where that leads,

755
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:44,640
like we know where that goes. And because it can't happen, then like we said, like I said before,

756
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:49,120
but it's going to end up looking like a scapegoating, where we're going to choose some,

757
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:55,200
we're going to find examples that we can drag out in public and, you know, and have struggle

758
01:12:55,200 --> 01:13:00,560
sessions, watch struggle sessions and have them be humiliated in public so that we can deal with

759
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:07,520
the problem of eradicating something which is, which is unconscious bias. Like it's unconscious.

760
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:15,680
So you can't, how can you eradicate it? Well, I think trying to eradicate that is,

761
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:21,680
I mean, given what we've argued, isn't that the same? It's ultimately committing you at some

762
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:27,280
level to eradicating the machinery of humanity. That's right. Right. And so,

763
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:36,000
let's say that this is, I've been more and more attracted to René Girard in the past year, I

764
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:40,480
would say, you know, just because of everything that's happened. And I've been seeing that his

765
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:47,760
analysis of the situation is really one of the wisest in terms of the way that he interpreted

766
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:53,440
what's happening and intersectionality. I mean, he passed away, I think around 2010 or maybe a bit

767
01:13:53,440 --> 01:14:00,160
later. You know, he talked about, I saw a quote of his in 2007 where he talked about the machine of

768
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:06,720
Antichrist, which is ramping up. And he saw exactly what we're seeing. He said, it'll be infinite

769
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:12,960
victimhood looking for infinite scapegoat. And so it's like this perpetual wheel of victimhood,

770
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:18,240
which is looking perpetually for more and more scapegoats, like almost like a self-devouring

771
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:25,840
machine. And so we're seeing it. The solution is, like I hate to, I know you dislike when I

772
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:34,320
push it too far, but the solution is the image of the scapegoat being the murderer and this,

773
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:39,840
and the victim at the same time, right? Identifying with Christ and identifying with those that killed

774
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:47,600
him. Identifying with the capacity to exclude and the reality of also being excluded to a certain

775
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:53,520
extent. Like those two things together, if you can kind of, you can integrate them properly and not

776
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:59,600
in a weird disorderly manner, can help you have compassion for those who are excluded, but can

777
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:04,960
help you also understand that you are one of those who do that all the time. You're always doing it.

778
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:11,840
But this is what I meant. I think there's power under argument. I've only read the one book and

779
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:17,520
I'm not completely at the one I saw on Satan Fall like lightning. But the idea that you can

780
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:22,800
explode, if you'll allow me to use some of my terms, you can explode the cultural cognitive grammar

781
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:27,680
of scapegoating and that the Christian mythos does that. I thought that was one of the most

782
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:33,040
powerful arguments. And it's a new argument, as far as I know, one of the most powerful

783
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:38,000
apologetic arguments for Christianity that I had heard in quite some time. So I think that

784
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:45,680
is a good point that you brought up. But I think it's situated within this larger past again,

785
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:51,600
which we can keep coming back to, of trying to get to a place where we can simultaneously accept

786
01:15:51,600 --> 01:16:01,280
faith and virtue. Because one of the ways in which you can address people's thoughts and feelings

787
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:09,600
is by inspiring them to aspire to virtue. Rather than trying to eradicate, you can try to inspire

788
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:17,040
the aspiration to virtue. And this has been, to my mind, a very, very successful strategy,

789
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:22,960
where I've been talking a lot recently, and Akira the Don did the meaning wave about it,

790
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:27,520
about stealing the culture. And I actually use Christianity as a primary example of that,

791
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:33,120
that Christianity doesn't try and overthrow the political structure. What it does is it steals

792
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:38,400
the culture. It creates an entirely different culture from the bottom up. And then, because

793
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:44,560
the problem, to my mind, what the French Revolution shows is you can radically transform the state,

794
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:49,280
but if you don't transform the underlying cultural, cognitive, grammar, and normativity,

795
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:56,160
nothing is fundamentally going to change. Yeah, you just changed the ones who are holding the

796
01:16:56,560 --> 01:17:05,200
reins. You circulate the elites. Exactly. Whereas what Christianity does is it builds a new

797
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:10,560
civilization. Buddhism does the same thing. It builds a new civilization. Islam does the same

798
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:18,320
thing. It builds a new civilization. And so that brings us, and we don't have much time, I suppose,

799
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:24,240
but that brings me towards the third point. You said, you sort of despair of knowing what to do.

800
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:34,240
And I'm wondering if you, I'm sorry, I realized I might be daring the pro-Hasturist thing with

801
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:39,440
proposing some sort of a Christian thing to a Christian, which is a ridiculous thing.

802
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:47,840
But I gave you all of those examples. And to my mind of the idea of, well, isn't the response to

803
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:55,440
do as much as we can to engage in building the next culture? And that sounds preposterous,

804
01:17:55,440 --> 01:18:01,760
but a commitment to that kind of thing seems to me to be the most responsible response

805
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:09,760
to the depth of the situation we are in right now. Yeah. No, I think so. I would say on a

806
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:17,360
personal level, love God, love your neighbor is a pretty good thing to live by in the immediate

807
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:23,280
reality and not abstract categories to deal, you know, to love the people that you encounter with,

808
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:28,960
to see in them the face of God is something that will transform at least your life. It's harder

809
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:36,080
in terms of like a social responsibility. For sure, myself, the way that I frame it,

810
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:43,280
that's why I'm doing what I'm doing. What you said is that I'm trying to help people see the

811
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:49,200
grammar of culture or see the pattern. And of course, one of the things I've been emphasizing

812
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:54,160
the most is the importance of the margin and talking about the margin in a balanced way so

813
01:18:54,160 --> 01:19:00,320
that you neither have the desire to, because both sides want to eliminate the margin. Everybody

814
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:05,920
wants to eliminate it. They want to eliminate the margin either by making it the same as the center,

815
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:10,720
by integrating all the marginal aspects and making them equal to everything else,

816
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:16,800
or by eradication or by cutting it off. And that's the real problem with the,

817
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:24,160
it's the question we had during the first wave of violence of the 20th century. You had two sides.

818
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:30,000
You had one side which wanted to create an equal utopia and one which wanted to create

819
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:36,560
a hierarchical utopia that cut off the margin, that burned it off. And we're facing the same,

820
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:41,200
it's like we didn't deal with it. We're facing the same problem now. And we're seeing the one side

821
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:48,240
now, we're seeing the side that wants everything to be equal. But I always tell people that

822
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:55,200
when the Nazis came to Germany, they were on the verge of a communist revolution. The pendulum

823
01:19:55,200 --> 01:20:00,880
doesn't move in one direction. The pendulum swings and it's a scary thing to watch.

824
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:08,800
But this is part of the way in which again, the way in which this lack of, the lack of

825
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:16,720
of a dynamical nuance in thinking. So, you know, Leo Ferraro and I talk about this idea that

826
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:23,680
in living systems and right, you see opponent processing. And I've argued, right, and that

827
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:29,520
what an opponent processing means, this is the way you deal with trade-offs. And we've been talking

828
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:32,960
about trade-offs all the way through, right? You have opponent processing, you like your

829
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:37,200
parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system. Like the sympathetic nervous system is biased.

830
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:41,120
It tries to interpret everything as a threat or an opportunity and it arouses you. And the

831
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:44,720
parasympathetic system is biased and it tries to interpret everything as a signal that you should

832
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:49,680
relax and calm down. And they're working, their biases work in opposite direction, but they're

833
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:54,000
functionally integrated together because that's how you get the most self-corrective system.

834
01:20:54,320 --> 01:21:00,160
And what we're supposed to have, and you can see this in Dewey, right? Because we're supposed

835
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:05,760
to have a point processing, but what it's devolved into is adversarial processing.

836
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:11,920
And this is the eradication idea. Now it's a zero-sum game. I've given up the idea of

837
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:16,080
self-correction. I've given up the idea of commitment to a process that you and I, even

838
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:21,760
though we disagree, we can commit to. Like you and I do in dialogue. We have disagreements,

839
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:26,880
but we see the potential that we can correct each other in valuable ways that we mutually

840
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:33,440
appreciate. There was that commitment and that commitment to that process has been lost.

841
01:21:34,160 --> 01:21:40,880
Like the fact that most Americans are more distrusting of the opposite party than they are

842
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:46,160
a foreign threat. Like what the heck does that mean? What does that mean to you?

843
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:56,320
And so the adversarial eradicate the other, destroy the other, zero-sum game mentality,

844
01:21:56,320 --> 01:22:03,360
I think has made the process, I think, is broken. I think the process is broken.

845
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:10,480
And so I don't know. I don't see how, I mean, and Layman Pascal and others,

846
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:14,320
they disagree with me on this. I don't know how to work within that in a way.

847
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:20,000
And so that's what I mean by steal the culture, that I don't know if working within that machinery

848
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:27,120
is a viable strategy. I think no strategy has to be, you know, Jonathan, I was at a conference

849
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:32,960
two weeks ago called the Movement Summit. And there's all these communities of practice

850
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:40,160
springing up everywhere or trying to integrate mindfulness and movement practices and discourse

851
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:47,520
practices and so many of them. And, you know, these people, and they all want to talk to each

852
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:55,120
other and they want to network. And it felt very different. This is, it felt very, it was neither,

853
01:22:55,120 --> 01:23:01,440
you know, the revolution of the left or the law and order of the right. It was orthogonal to that.

854
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:08,960
It was these people trying to seriously time and talent and money and energy and commitment

855
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:16,240
to the cultivation of wisdom and a deeply alternative way of being. And to my mind, that's

856
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:21,600
where, and I know you think it should be given a particular Christian splint, but I also think

857
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:26,640
you're charitable enough to include other people of good faith who are willing to work with you.

858
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:32,160
I think that's where the answer to the more difficult problem lies. I think there is stuff

859
01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:37,280
actually happening right here, right now, culturally, symbolically, existentially,

860
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:41,440
that is where the difference that is needed is starting to be generated.

861
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:48,720
Oh, but I, for sure, agree. I think that the seeds of the, like a way to see it is like that

862
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:55,440
this is horrible because it has bad implications, but like the seeds of the next world will appear

863
01:23:55,440 --> 01:24:02,080
in the current one, right? They're just hard to see, you know, the little sprouts are hard to see

864
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:08,560
because everything else is burning in the forest, right? So it's difficult to see the seeds as this

865
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:14,960
is kind of breaking apart. And I mean, I'm curious to see how all of this will be integrated. I do,

866
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:20,480
I do, again, like, you know, we've talked about this before. So we're not going to come to a

867
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:29,360
conclusion, but I do think that there is a need for a narrative cohesion. And I do think that until

868
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:36,240
until something happens in the West, it's still, it's still the Christian narrative. So I don't,

869
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:41,040
I don't see a way out of it for at least, you know, I don't see a way out of it. So, but I,

870
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:46,240
I appreciate, I do think that the questions that people are asking and that the desire for wisdom

871
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:53,520
and the desire for transformation is one which will bear fruit. It won't, it has to, if it's done

872
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:57,920
with sincerity and done, you know, in a desire for transformation, it will bear fruit.

873
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:04,160
Yeah. And the point I'm trying to make is thank you for saying that. And you know, from my part,

874
01:25:04,160 --> 01:25:10,080
I don't, I don't ever claim to have a foreclosure argument against Christianity. I always say that

875
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:16,880
I do not have such a fit. But what I was trying to emphasize is there's not only sincerity,

876
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:23,600
there's depth in like what's going on here. It has the appreciation for humanity and complexity.

877
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:28,400
That's what I'm seeing in these people in this movement. Of course, we're all flawed human

878
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:33,280
beings. I'm not, I'm not painting some utopic vision, but I'm talking about, you know,

879
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:41,680
a real, a real possibility and the acknowledgement that I think it's, it's, it's, it's in existence.

880
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:46,480
I like your metaphor for all the ways it's fraught, but I do like your metaphor of the seeds. I do

881
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:50,240
like putting the two together, that the burning of the forest actually fertilizes the seeds in the

882
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:54,880
way they need to be fertilized. And perhaps you were alluding to that and your right smile.

883
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:59,680
Yeah, but it's not, it's not a fun. It's not fun. Like it's not pleasurable.

884
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:06,000
No, there's, and it means, it means death and suffering. Yep. And I have kids and I don't want

885
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:13,520
this, but I want and what needs to happen are not always the same thing. Yeah. Jonathan, I think

886
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:21,040
maybe this would be a good place to bring it to a close. So I proposed to you privately and you

887
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:26,160
already agreed. So I'm going to do it publicly. I think that you and I and Paul should have a,

888
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:31,600
have a discussion like this, the logos, as I would call it, at length for the three of us.

889
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:36,080
And I'd like to invite you and then I've also invited Paul and let's, let's try and work to

890
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:41,440
make it happen because I think it would be very beneficial for all of our respective listeners.

891
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:45,040
Yeah, that would be great. I would, I would love that. We, let's set it up.

892
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:52,160
Okay. So I'll reach out to Paul and I'll try and make it happen. So I found, well, you could see,

893
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:57,920
I got passionate, which means this was definitely, this is definitely the logos for me. I always say

894
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:04,320
that the difference between the logos and monologue is both people find themselves adduced. They find

895
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:08,640
themselves drawn to a place they couldn't get to individually on the road. And there's a kind

896
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:12,880
of education and then that that's very different from just sort of thinking in your own head.

897
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:17,840
And so I always find that the case when I get into such a dialogue with you,

898
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:22,960
and I wanted to thank you for it. You had so many, so many insightful, brilliant ways,

899
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:29,120
so many insights and brilliant things you said. And not only what you said, the manner in which

900
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:34,480
you said the imagery that you use was itself often deeply helpful. So thank you very much.

901
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:38,800
Thank you very, very much. Well, you know, I really, I always enjoy talking to you and I,

902
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:42,400
and I really appreciate the insight you're bringing to the conversation. And I'm

903
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:47,760
looking forward to seeing where this is going and kind of how, how this is slowly going to,

904
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:52,480
let's say play dance together is the best way to maybe to say it.

905
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:57,040
Yeah. Yeah. I agree. I agree. Okay. So thank you very much.

906
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:58,960
All right, John. It was good to talk to you.

907
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:00,800
Good talk to you. All right. Bye-bye.

908
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:01,440
Bye-bye.
