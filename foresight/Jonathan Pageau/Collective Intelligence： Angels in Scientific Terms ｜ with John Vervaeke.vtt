00:00.000 --> 00:06.160
So hello, everybody. I am here with John Revekey. Many of you, most of you, everyone who's watching

00:06.160 --> 00:11.200
this will have seen a video with me and John Revekey before. And also, John had a discussion

00:11.200 --> 00:17.200
with Jordan Peterson a few months ago. And that discussion, in that discussion, many things came

00:17.200 --> 00:21.680
up that were related to also John and I's discussion, and then Jordan and I's discussion.

00:22.240 --> 00:27.600
And so Jordan, someone in the group had the idea of doing something with me. And then that added

00:27.680 --> 00:33.520
Bishop Barron on top. And so a few weeks ago, we had a discussion with Bishop Barron, which is

00:33.520 --> 00:38.800
going to be online. I'll link it to the description. Many of you may even have seen it. And it was a

00:38.800 --> 00:44.880
very interesting discussion, one which at first kind of tried to find its way. And then suddenly,

00:44.880 --> 00:50.160
we really felt like it just kind of took off. And many interesting things were said. So John and I

00:50.160 --> 00:55.040
thought it would be a good idea to kind of dive back into the things that we talked about and

00:55.120 --> 00:57.600
explore them even more. So John, thanks for coming.

01:09.600 --> 01:13.200
This is Jonathan Peugeot. Welcome to the symbolic world.

01:13.360 --> 01:26.560
It's a great pleasure, Jonathan. And it was my idea, by the way, to include you.

01:27.840 --> 01:33.280
That's very kind of you. Well, no, because, well, friendship was part of it. But the other part

01:33.280 --> 01:38.880
of it was you were very much a ghostly presence in the conversation I had with Jordan. And I felt

01:38.960 --> 01:44.160
it was unfair, ultimately, to not allow you to actually be present and be involved. So that's

01:44.160 --> 01:48.800
why I suggested it to Jordan. And it's interesting because with adding Bishop Barron, the conversation

01:48.800 --> 01:54.400
definitely morphed into something completely different. Yeah, because he's not involved in

01:54.400 --> 01:59.040
this kind of inner, the way that we've been talking about religion, let's say, for the past several

01:59.040 --> 02:05.520
years, you and I and Jordan in our different ways, but kind of coming towards similar ideas about

02:05.520 --> 02:11.280
phenomenology or in your sense, more kind of coccy and Jordan's evolutionary approach, all of

02:11.280 --> 02:16.480
this is kind of coming towards something. And Bishop Barron is dropping out from outside with

02:16.480 --> 02:21.520
a more kind of Catholic, Thomas and Augustinian way of thinking. So for me, that was one of the

02:21.520 --> 02:26.960
most interesting things was to watch the discussion move towards the direction where all of a sudden

02:26.960 --> 02:32.000
I could see in Bishop Barron's eyes that he was like, oh, this is like there's something else going

02:32.000 --> 02:38.560
on here. There's another type of discussion. Yeah, he just wrote, I just read it this morning. I

02:38.560 --> 02:46.320
didn't read it thoroughly. I just read parts of it. He wrote a blog about and yeah, he was very

02:46.320 --> 02:54.320
clearly appreciative in all three senses of the word of the discussion. And so I think your

02:54.320 --> 03:01.520
observation is accurate. And so I think that this is, to me, it was exciting because I think that

03:01.520 --> 03:07.440
the discussion we're having and bringing it back to the human experience in a way that a lot of

03:07.440 --> 03:12.000
the arguments that have been going on in the past few hundred years, a lot of them have been arguing

03:12.000 --> 03:16.720
religion from a sociological perspective or from a scientific perspective, even which is that was

03:16.720 --> 03:21.760
always the worst, the worst one, but a lot of it from kind of a more philosophical, metaphysical

03:21.760 --> 03:27.040
perspective. But the way that we're trying to bring, come towards it, although it does include

03:27.040 --> 03:32.480
metaphysics and sociology and all of that, it brings it back to this just the way that we

03:32.480 --> 03:40.480
experience the world and how it's coherent with those experiences. Yeah, I think that's right.

03:42.720 --> 03:46.640
And part of what we're doing is trying to articulate and explicate and elucidate the

03:46.640 --> 03:50.960
relationship between these things. So what I'm going to say isn't going to be terribly clear,

03:50.960 --> 03:58.240
but not only is there a convergence between us, and I share that with you, by the way,

03:58.240 --> 04:03.200
that sense, and I'm appreciative of it. I think there's this convergence around

04:03.200 --> 04:09.840
things, these topics of meaning and wisdom and transformation and connectedness

04:11.680 --> 04:19.680
and the central roles of intelligence in an ancient sense and the tension, the way they're

04:20.400 --> 04:23.280
that's what I want to say, the way intelligence and attention are bound up together.

04:24.480 --> 04:30.400
All of these things are coming together, I think, in a very powerful way. And I think

04:32.240 --> 04:39.600
that convergence between us and between those terms and concepts and topics is also resonant.

04:39.600 --> 04:45.680
It's not identical, but it's deeply analogous to some of the convergence I see happening in

04:45.680 --> 04:50.560
sort of the broader culture, at least aspects of it, or what Seville King calls this corner of

04:50.560 --> 04:55.760
the Internet. It's getting to be a pretty big corner, but yeah, I appreciate that.

04:56.320 --> 05:00.080
Yeah, it's interesting because this corner of the Internet also, it has its different branches

05:00.080 --> 05:06.400
and different emphases, but it definitely is this kind of convergence. I would say the way

05:06.400 --> 05:12.080
that I see it is also an exciting opening, you could say it's like that. There's an exciting

05:12.080 --> 05:19.200
opening where things that people before couldn't understand or didn't understand, all of a sudden

05:19.200 --> 05:26.160
they're starting to get a sense of what it's about. The basic idea that religion was superstitious,

05:26.160 --> 05:34.400
that religion is silly, that it's just added on to our experience was the common understanding,

05:34.400 --> 05:37.920
not for everyone, but it was like a common understanding that was floating around in

05:37.920 --> 05:43.840
culture, but now that seems to be breaking down and people are excited to now be able to understand

05:44.400 --> 05:47.280
things that before just didn't make any sense to them at all.

05:48.400 --> 05:55.840
Yeah, I agree with that very much. I mean, I think there's a bifurcation. I think that that's

05:55.840 --> 06:05.200
happening. Way before COVID, even before I did Awakening for the Meaning Crisis, I was reading

06:05.200 --> 06:10.640
about people talking about the religious turn within phenomenology, that that was a broad movement

06:10.640 --> 06:18.640
happening. Then I saw within the emergence of 4e cognitive science that these themes that were

06:18.640 --> 06:24.560
previously considered woo-woo, mindfulness and mystical experience and wisdom and meaning

06:24.560 --> 06:30.400
and transformation and even the sense of the sacred, these are now coming into, these are

06:30.400 --> 06:35.680
legitimate topics again and it's been a very rapid increase. On the other hand, I also see

06:36.720 --> 06:45.040
the ramping up of the machinery of distraction in our culture and the machinery of surrogacy

06:45.040 --> 06:54.000
where we're going to replace the real pursuit of meaning and wisdom with surrogates, some rather

06:54.720 --> 07:02.320
innocuous and others really, really toxic. I see that, both of those happening and that's not

07:02.320 --> 07:08.240
a contradiction. I think they're both happening for the same reason. Yeah, that makes a lot of

07:08.240 --> 07:16.560
sense that there's a zeitgeist that's pulling things, pulling apart the ancient, the modern

07:16.560 --> 07:23.040
world who's pulling it apart and now people lost in there. The phenomena that is bringing us

07:23.040 --> 07:29.680
this new understanding of religion is the same phenomena that brings about viral videos on YouTube.

07:30.960 --> 07:35.920
All of a sudden realizing how much attention is part of the way the world manifests itself,

07:35.920 --> 07:41.280
but in that version, the viral video on YouTube is really the broken down version of it where

07:41.280 --> 07:45.840
all of a sudden things pop up, take up all the attention and then vanish and then pop up,

07:45.840 --> 07:52.800
take up all the attention and then vanish, this super rapid cycle of attention. But like you

07:52.800 --> 07:59.600
said, if you take those two phenomena together, it points us to people understanding or becoming

07:59.600 --> 08:08.720
more aware of attention, the problem and the opportunities of attention. Yeah, I think this

08:08.720 --> 08:13.600
is consonant with what you're saying. It's a case of one group of people and I'm not trying to do an

08:13.600 --> 08:21.280
us them thing. I'm just trying to write the people who are becoming aware of the centrality of

08:21.360 --> 08:28.240
attention and what I call relevance realization and connectedness and the human need for both

08:28.240 --> 08:33.760
grounding and self-transcendence and both individuation and participation in the community,

08:33.760 --> 08:39.040
all of that and COVID I think highlighted all these themes. But then there's people who are not

08:39.040 --> 08:46.320
so much aware of it, but embodying it almost like in a psychoanalytic sense, they're acting it out

08:46.320 --> 08:52.080
the importance of attention and salience and relevance. But they're acting it out in a way

08:52.080 --> 08:58.800
that's generally not fruitful for their own flourishing or the flourishing of the people

08:58.800 --> 09:04.880
that they're living with or living in connection with. Exactly, also because the internet has

09:04.880 --> 09:13.200
afforded a space where the relationship between attention and power has been increased thousands

09:13.200 --> 09:21.280
of times and so all of a sudden people understanding that how attention can be a weapon and attention

09:21.280 --> 09:27.600
can be a way to dominate and can be a way to seduce and can be all these things are kind of

09:27.600 --> 09:33.760
coming up to the four, but instead of in a little village where you realize that you can do things

09:33.760 --> 09:41.360
to manipulate others or to kind of... Now you have 100,000 people, 100,000 people under you

09:41.360 --> 09:48.720
that can act as your body to act out in the world and yeah, we see the results of that.

09:49.440 --> 09:57.120
Yeah, the internet's kind of like Tolkien's The One Ring. It's just this magnifier in some

09:57.120 --> 10:03.840
fashion and it can magnify, for the Hobbits, it magnifies their sort of diminutive sneakiness

10:03.840 --> 10:09.280
and they can become invisible, but for Sauron it magnifies his cruelty and his might. So yeah,

10:09.280 --> 10:17.280
I think the internet is very much like The One Ring in that fashion and maybe that myth

10:17.280 --> 10:25.840
coming to mind isn't totally just ephemeral. I mean, part of it is we are not doing one of the

10:25.840 --> 10:31.520
strongest recommendations of that whole fantasy series is to step back and really reflect and

10:31.520 --> 10:38.800
think about what's our relationship to The One Ring and should we be picking it up and

10:38.800 --> 10:45.360
should we be more wary of it and things like that. And I do worry that we are running this

10:45.360 --> 10:51.680
grand social experiment with social media and with phones on ourselves and the next generation.

10:51.680 --> 10:55.840
There's already some preliminary evidence that's having an impact and we don't know what this is

10:55.840 --> 11:00.640
going to do. We're doing something that is 10 times more powerful than the printing press

11:00.640 --> 11:06.400
and the printing press unleashed forces that then turned to bloody religious war in an

11:06.400 --> 11:12.560
unforeseen fashion. And so I do not think we are exercising proper care around this.

11:13.440 --> 11:18.960
That's for sure. Nobody gets too big. It is like, you know, when we talk about,

11:19.920 --> 11:24.160
this is when I look at the internet and I look at social media, it's the closest thing I have to

11:24.160 --> 11:29.920
understanding a kind of, how can I say this, a God acting in the world in the sense that

11:29.920 --> 11:38.480
like a pagan deity that is embodied in ritual and in practice and in nodes of attention because

11:38.480 --> 11:44.240
it's just, there's no one controlling it. But it still seems to have a will and seems to be going

11:44.240 --> 11:49.680
towards a telos and everybody sees it and nobody can stop it. And everybody says, well, at least

11:49.680 --> 11:54.960
I'm going to get what I can get as I watch this God kind of move towards its sacrifice or whatever

11:54.960 --> 11:58.640
is going on. But everybody's like, well, at least I can get something out of it while it's happening.

11:59.440 --> 12:07.440
I think that's a very apropos way of thinking of it. I often use Thomas Merton's idea of a hyper

12:07.440 --> 12:18.640
object. And Morton, Thomas Morton, I misspoke. Yeah, I was surprised that you would have a term

12:18.640 --> 12:26.960
like that. And so Morton's idea in hyper objects is that there are things like,

12:27.920 --> 12:36.320
the internet, global warming, evolution, their realities, but they're not bodies.

12:36.320 --> 12:43.840
They're not spatially temporarily located. They're distributed. And we can't actually

12:43.840 --> 12:48.560
sort of conceive of them. We can have terms referring to them, but we can't sort of,

12:48.560 --> 12:52.800
if you allow me the science fiction reference, we can't grok them. We can't sort of really get.

12:53.680 --> 13:01.520
And so we, but they're not abstract things over there, right? They're insinuating themselves

13:01.520 --> 13:08.560
into the very fiber of our being. Yeah, they have more subtle bodies to use or they disturb.

13:08.560 --> 13:15.200
Yeah. And I'm fine with that. And you see a similar kind of move in later Neoplatonism.

13:15.200 --> 13:18.400
We can wear Proclus and the elements of theology and he's trying to work out

13:18.400 --> 13:24.240
all of these principalities and powers and principles. And I think the relationship

13:24.880 --> 13:30.960
that a lot of people have to the internet is properly understood as a religious relationship.

13:30.960 --> 13:36.560
I mean, the internet serves as an oracle. Think about that. I mean, think about the devotion

13:36.560 --> 13:43.360
people, they want to live in its world. And like you said, they have a sense of it having a life

13:43.360 --> 13:48.400
and power of their own that people want to be in service to, but they also want to appropriate

13:48.400 --> 13:52.800
that power. It's very much, it's almost like, you know, bald or something from the Old Testament

13:53.440 --> 13:59.520
in that fashion. And so I think that's again, just to circle it back, I think that's again,

14:00.160 --> 14:05.120
right? The reason why these things are coming together and you talk about this better than I

14:05.120 --> 14:10.160
do, right? It is, right? The, what we're talking about, but the internet and what we're talking

14:10.160 --> 14:18.560
about about this, this meaning wisdom movement about religion, those again, they might seem

14:18.560 --> 14:24.000
like opposites or in opposition, but there's a deep underlying common ground that they're both

14:24.000 --> 14:30.720
pointing to again, right? This phenomena, I don't think it's a coincidence that the internet and,

14:30.720 --> 14:38.080
you know, the shared universes of Marvel and all of this are also occurring at the same time as

14:38.080 --> 14:42.800
this return to an understanding of the depth and importance of religion. I think those are

14:42.800 --> 14:49.520
completely, they belong together in terms of a unified explanation. Yeah. There's an interesting

14:49.520 --> 14:54.240
thing that I've been realizing recently is that one of the, one of the aspects that seems to have

14:54.240 --> 14:59.600
happened in Christianity, but probably has happened in Buddhism as well, because it seems similar,

14:59.600 --> 15:06.880
is then the understanding that ultimately the sacrifice is a sacrifice of, we say a sacrifice

15:06.880 --> 15:11.120
of worship. That's how the Christians were presented. Like when we go to Vespers service,

15:11.120 --> 15:15.120
we talk about the evening sacrifice, and it's a sacrifice of worship. And it's to actually

15:15.120 --> 15:20.800
understand that sacrifices is attention. That's what sacrifices, right? And so it's this,

15:21.520 --> 15:26.560
the way that you attend, when you attend, you kind of give your attention to the thing that

15:26.560 --> 15:31.840
you're attending to. And at the same time, you're also sacrificing the things next to them, right?

15:31.840 --> 15:37.920
You're focusing. Yes. Yes. Yes. And so, and that seems to be something which with the internet is

15:37.920 --> 15:45.120
now accelerating so much that it's almost impossible not to notice that that's what it is, that the

15:45.120 --> 15:52.240
internet is like a, is like a monster, or is a being that lives through attention, that requires

15:52.240 --> 15:57.120
our attention to exist. Like Neil Gaiman, I don't know if you know a little bit about Neil Gaiman,

15:57.200 --> 16:02.640
he has, he wrote a lot about that. Like in some of his series, even in American gods, he had this

16:02.640 --> 16:07.360
idea that these gods exist through attention. And if you don't give them attention, then they

16:07.360 --> 16:12.480
weaken. If you give them attention, then they become stronger. And for all my criticism, Neil

16:12.480 --> 16:17.600
Gaiman, that's a really powerful understanding. And I think one that is actually very Christian,

16:17.600 --> 16:22.160
like that we really do have this idea that, you know, as we move away from the physical

16:22.240 --> 16:27.680
sacrificial system in ancient times, we move toward the world where we understand sacrifice as

16:27.680 --> 16:35.040
attention itself. I think that's, I think that is so consonant with the model that's emerging

16:36.480 --> 16:43.840
by Wall and others who are the cog side of attention. We're moving from a rather simple

16:43.840 --> 16:50.480
model of attention as a filter to that what was actually happening in attention is prioritization.

16:51.040 --> 16:57.360
So that the function of attention is to prioritize. And so, and that means,

16:58.160 --> 17:05.520
I think quite correctly, like you said, that good attention is proper prioritization,

17:05.520 --> 17:09.440
if you think of it that way, that you're prioritizing the things that should be given priority.

17:10.000 --> 17:17.760
And I don't know if this is adequate, and I'm not claiming it is, but I can see why notions

17:17.840 --> 17:23.920
of worship and sacrifice are bound up together. There's two sides of the same coin of the idea

17:23.920 --> 17:31.760
of trying to give proper priority, you know, to quote Aristotle and people don't understand it,

17:31.760 --> 17:37.120
you know, first things first, right? And people think that just means the first thing on your

17:37.120 --> 17:42.480
list is the first thing you should do. That's not what Aristotle means. He means that the task is

17:42.480 --> 17:49.840
to realize what the first principles are and to prioritize them over things that are less

17:49.840 --> 17:57.280
central to being and to truth, et cetera. And so, and I think of that as the virtue of reverence.

17:57.280 --> 18:04.080
And I think reverence is to properly realize the relevance of something that should be given

18:04.080 --> 18:09.280
a priority even over yourself. And that's where it starts. Yeah, that's where you start to get

18:09.280 --> 18:13.760
the notions of sacrifice and worship, which I, like I say, if you go away from sacrifices,

18:13.760 --> 18:19.920
killing something, right, which is usually focal in people's mind to this idea of prioritization

18:19.920 --> 18:25.840
and a recognition and acknowledgement of priority, then I think I'm in agreement with what you're

18:25.840 --> 18:30.720
talking about. Yeah, and the idea of killing something is always the wrong way of understanding

18:30.720 --> 18:37.600
sacrifice, at least at the first level. It often involves killing something, but not necessarily.

18:37.760 --> 18:42.880
There are sacrifices of grain, sacrifices of oil, all these different sacrifices. It has to do with

18:42.880 --> 18:49.440
offering up. You take something that's precious, and then you give it up towards something which

18:49.440 --> 18:55.200
is above you. And that's exactly what attention is, and that's what prioritization is. One of the

18:55.200 --> 19:00.480
interesting things I wanted to ask you about, because there's something that I've been thinking

19:00.480 --> 19:04.400
about, and there are several priests that are thinking about this right now, is that in the

19:04.400 --> 19:09.520
Jewish law, like in the Hebraic law, during Yom Kippur, which was the day of atonement,

19:09.520 --> 19:15.360
the day of becoming one, there were two sacrifices. And this, I'm wondering what you think about this

19:15.360 --> 19:21.680
in terms of attention. There was a sacrifice which was offered up and was used to purify the space,

19:21.680 --> 19:28.400
and then there was a sacrifice which was cast away, a scapegoat, which was sent out to Azizel,

19:28.400 --> 19:35.600
which is a demon out in the wilderness. This is what I've been thinking about in terms of

19:35.600 --> 19:40.160
attention, which is the attention seems to have two parts to it. One which is a concentration,

19:40.160 --> 19:47.360
focus, prioritization, but another part which is a cutting off, a circumcision, a cutting off of

19:48.320 --> 19:54.160
you have to be able to chop off the things that are pushing in or trying to take over, let's say,

19:54.160 --> 19:58.880
and then so it's like a double movement, one of focusing and then one of pushing away. I don't

19:58.880 --> 20:08.000
know if that's something that is consonant with. Yeah, I think it is, and I'll need a little bit

20:08.000 --> 20:16.720
of space, but what I mean by that is, I think the prioritization function, so what I mean is give up

20:16.720 --> 20:23.200
the old model of there's input and then there's processing and then there's output. The newer

20:23.200 --> 20:28.080
model is there's a sensory motor loop. As I'm moving, I'm sensing, as I'm sensing, I'm moving,

20:28.080 --> 20:33.520
and there really isn't anything, there isn't a homunculus willpower out there. Instead, there's

20:33.520 --> 20:39.520
something more like character. There are sets of constraints on this, and then what we're doing,

20:39.520 --> 20:43.920
and we remember, and attention is self-organizing like that because we both direct attention,

20:43.920 --> 20:50.560
but attention also directs us, and so what we're trying to do is, what I'm trying to get you to

20:50.640 --> 20:56.560
see is a new way of thinking of what decision is. Instead of thinking of decision as the

20:56.560 --> 21:02.080
executor behind it all, like doing this, think of decision as exactly what you're saying.

21:03.520 --> 21:10.560
A way of thinking about this is attention is both ruling in and ruling out. It's what's

21:10.560 --> 21:16.000
ruled in and what's ruled out. This is analogous, one of my former students and now colleague,

21:16.080 --> 21:18.720
Corey Lewis, talks about this in the philosophy of science. He talks about

21:19.600 --> 21:26.720
that what laws do is they rule out. They say no, no, no, no, and that what models do is rule in.

21:26.720 --> 21:31.520
This is what you have to bring in and this is what you have to prioritize in order to do your

21:31.520 --> 21:39.760
thing. In an analogous fashion, attention is making decisions of ruling in and ruling out. Did

21:39.760 --> 21:44.560
that help? No, that makes a lot of sense, and it makes a lot of sense. Also, if you think of things

21:44.640 --> 21:49.760
like ancient law, like ancient Roman law, the way that it worked, there were two aspects of the

21:49.760 --> 21:58.720
system, one which was a tortoise and a patestas. Patestas were the actual rules, like the military

21:58.720 --> 22:04.240
or the embodiment of what you're not allowed to do, the police part of it. The other one was a

22:04.240 --> 22:09.520
tortoise, which was the model, like you said, the thing you follow, the person you model your life

22:09.520 --> 22:18.640
on. Someone who inspires you to be a certain way. It was a direct, non-explicit model. Then

22:18.640 --> 22:25.520
the other one is an explicit set of rules that is lacking the more direct part of it. It ends up

22:25.520 --> 22:33.040
being a right hand and a left hand of how the system works, let's say. You can see that with

22:33.040 --> 22:37.440
the idea of the saints and then the canons of the church, for example, where you have models

22:37.440 --> 22:40.720
you're supposed to follow, and then you have a bunch of things you're allowed to do or not allowed

22:40.720 --> 22:48.400
to do, like all these rules that are more precise and more about what you're not allowed to do,

22:48.400 --> 22:57.360
let's say. One way of thinking about it is attention has the function of constraining

22:57.360 --> 23:06.320
possibility. This is impossible. It's structuring that, or at least this is highly improbable,

23:06.320 --> 23:11.840
and this is even in predictive processing models of attention, but you also need attention

23:11.840 --> 23:21.440
as also aspirational. Yeah, that's a nice word. Love that. Yeah. It's trying to disclose the

23:21.440 --> 23:28.720
affordances by which we can more properly come into conformity or transformative relationship to

23:28.720 --> 23:33.600
what's real, what's happening, what's relevant, what's pertinent, all the sort of stuff that I

23:33.600 --> 23:41.840
tend to obsess about. Yeah, very much. Then the idea also that's happening with attention that

23:41.840 --> 23:50.880
goes into this is to not have a humane model of attention. The humane model of attention is the

23:50.880 --> 23:56.800
static impersonal observer and Toad in his book on body and mind says, that's why Hume can't find

23:56.800 --> 24:07.200
causation of the world because his model of attention is a pure passive spectacle of observation

24:07.200 --> 24:16.160
and not moving around engaging. The other thing is to, this goes with Christopher Moll's work,

24:16.160 --> 24:22.320
that attention is adverbial. It's a way of modifying other things you're doing. Let me quickly

24:22.320 --> 24:27.040
point out what I mean by that. We tend to think of attention as a spotlight and we shine it and

24:27.040 --> 24:30.720
there's truth to that because light makes things stand out and that's what attention does. It

24:30.720 --> 24:35.920
makes things more salient. But the thing is, and Moll points this out, but attention isn't like

24:35.920 --> 24:42.960
walking. I can say to you, walk. Get up and walk. Okay. Now, if I say to you, start practicing,

24:42.960 --> 24:48.800
you'll say to me, practice what? Or if I say, train, begin training, you'll go train what?

24:48.800 --> 24:52.160
The things we do that we do by modifying other things. And if I say to you,

24:53.040 --> 24:56.000
you have to do this a little bit or subtly to bring it up. I say, I want you to pay attention,

24:56.000 --> 25:01.760
but I don't want you to pay attention by changing how you're looking or how you're listening or how

25:01.760 --> 25:06.080
you're remembering or how you're coordinating, looking, listening and remembering. I just want

25:06.080 --> 25:14.880
you to pay attention and you'll say to me, I don't know what that means. Attention is a way in which,

25:14.880 --> 25:20.480
this is what I mean. It's more adverbial. It's a way in which we're modifying our connectedness

25:20.480 --> 25:25.440
to reality. And it's not like it's not a beam coming out of our head. It's a shaping of our

25:25.440 --> 25:31.360
whole orientation and connectedness to reality. It's a much more comprehensive thing. Does that

25:31.360 --> 25:37.360
make sense? It makes a lot of sense. It makes a lot of sense because at least in kind of the

25:37.360 --> 25:42.400
orthodox perspective, theological perspective, there really is this idea of synergistic

25:43.120 --> 25:48.960
relationship, like synergistic relationship with God, where like you said, there's a sense in which

25:48.960 --> 25:55.360
you're kind of called, like you're called for, and then you kind of moved forward, but that also

25:55.360 --> 26:01.360
affects the amount of calling or the direction of calling. So it's something that's very difficult

26:01.360 --> 26:05.920
to fully separate and say something like, you know, like that's God acting, that's you acting.

26:05.920 --> 26:12.240
It's like, no, it's this constant moving between this call towards your own telos and then your

26:12.480 --> 26:17.440
capacity to embody it and then it modifies the direction. So it's like you said, it's a more

26:17.440 --> 26:23.120
kind of, it's a synergistic model in terms of how we took what transformation.

26:23.120 --> 26:27.920
It's synergistic this way. Exactly. There's the calling and it's not action or passivity,

26:27.920 --> 26:34.720
it's participation, but it's also synergistic this way. It's not sort of a Cartesian theater

26:34.720 --> 26:41.200
or Lockean theater. It's the whole person. Like if I would put it in a slogan and take caution around

26:41.200 --> 26:46.160
that because it's a slogan, but you attend with your whole body. You don't just attend with sort of

26:46.160 --> 26:53.760
through your brain. Yeah, right. That's what I'm trying to get at. And then another dimension of

26:53.760 --> 27:02.080
that is the fact that attention is often shared in it. Like distributed attention is a significant

27:02.080 --> 27:09.040
part of distributed cognition. So wait, like children, if you watch babies, like they joint

27:09.120 --> 27:15.360
attention in that loop that you're talking about not like between people is what makes language

27:15.360 --> 27:23.840
learning possible. Like attention is there primordially, joint attention. And we take it for

27:23.840 --> 27:32.960
granted. Like when I point, you look, you try and trace out my attention. But if you point,

27:32.960 --> 27:38.080
like for any other animal, they look at your finger because you hate it salient, right?

27:38.080 --> 27:43.920
But and notice how kids, when kids are at the one word stage, they supplement it with pointing.

27:44.880 --> 27:52.480
So they use joint attention to make meaning, to make meaning clear. So again, it's more whole

27:52.480 --> 28:01.120
person. It's more dynamic. And it's more shared and joint. I mean, it's funny. You'll like this.

28:01.760 --> 28:07.920
There's a line in the Psalms that is sort of resonating with me as I get into this,

28:07.920 --> 28:12.880
which there's a line where it says deep calling to deep, right? The deep calling to deep, right?

28:15.280 --> 28:20.800
And so that that's that's sort of my, I don't know what to put, I don't mean I'm not trying to be

28:20.800 --> 28:25.440
sacrilegious anymore. I'm trying to be say something that stands out for me. That's kind of a biblical

28:25.440 --> 28:31.200
motto, I guess I have for this, for the way of thinking about this. And it is properly,

28:32.160 --> 28:35.840
again, for me, because it again, it brings up this deep connection we're talking about

28:35.840 --> 28:41.760
between all of this and religio, right? So here's a question in terms of study,

28:41.760 --> 28:44.560
because this is something that I've been talking about and thinking about, but I'd like to know

28:44.560 --> 28:50.560
your opinion on it. It seems that we have something also about common joint attention.

28:51.520 --> 28:58.240
We seem to search out places and moments where we can all attend to similar things as a group,

28:58.240 --> 29:02.160
right? So you go to a concert, even just in terms of entertainment, why do you go to the

29:02.160 --> 29:06.080
movie theater? Like we all sit together and then we watch, of course there's the big screen,

29:06.080 --> 29:09.840
but there's something more than the big screen, which is why we like watching movies with friends

29:09.840 --> 29:15.680
and with with family. And so it seems like there's also something in terms of that there's a

29:15.680 --> 29:22.160
transformation which occurs through to common attention. And that seems for the good and ill,

29:22.160 --> 29:27.600
right? And so you I have the image of Hitler, you know, with like 100,000 people all standing in

29:27.600 --> 29:33.280
front of him and just giving him all their attention and it and it acting as like a catalyst for

29:33.280 --> 29:38.400
something insane. So I don't know if there's if people have studied that or talk very much,

29:38.400 --> 29:42.480
very much. I mean, so first of all, it goes directly to the point I just mentioned and

29:42.480 --> 29:49.360
people like Thomas Sello and others have made that apparent. How much of our cognitive development

29:49.360 --> 29:56.160
depends on is afforded by joint attention, the capacity for joint attention. And you think about

29:56.160 --> 30:02.640
why this would matter to hunter-gatherers, like joint attention is absolutely crucial for coordination,

30:02.640 --> 30:07.920
social coordination. It goes towards the work that Dan Chiapia and I have published about

30:08.000 --> 30:13.120
scientists, the NASA scientists, controlling the rovers on Mars. And how do they how do they

30:13.120 --> 30:20.640
can how do they get how do they coordinate their attention? But it also goes towards this. And

30:20.640 --> 30:24.640
think about how this works both internally and externally and how they reinforce each other.

30:25.200 --> 30:31.120
Notice and we know this even for young children and psychologists have the settings in of giving

30:31.120 --> 30:35.920
multiple names to the same problem, but the same phenomena or calling two different phenomena by

30:35.920 --> 30:39.920
the same name. It's called the jingle jangle problem. So it's known by many different names,

30:41.600 --> 30:46.240
inter sensory hypothesis and blah, blah, blah, intermodal and blah, blah. Okay. But they all

30:46.240 --> 30:51.520
are talking about the same thing that a child will prefer to look at a stimulus that it can both

30:51.520 --> 30:59.680
see and hear over a stimulus they can just see or that it can see and hear and touch. Right. And

30:59.680 --> 31:04.800
then there's good reason for this. If you have just I'll use some cybernetic language. If you have

31:04.800 --> 31:11.120
just a single channel, the chances that what you're seeing are due to subjective bias or distortion

31:11.120 --> 31:17.520
are quite high. But if I have two independent channels, the chances that the result is due

31:17.520 --> 31:23.680
to bias are reduced precisely, right, because of the increase of that convergence. That's what by

31:23.680 --> 31:28.400
the way, and it's not just sort of fascism. The reason why we like numbers is because numbers

31:28.400 --> 31:34.240
allow us to coordinate the senses. You can see three, you can hear three, you can touch three,

31:34.240 --> 31:39.920
three allows us to bind the senses together. And what that does is in using Russia's term,

31:39.920 --> 31:45.200
that increases the trustworthiness, not certainty, but it increases the trustworthiness of the

31:45.200 --> 31:49.520
information we're getting. Now think about this and Plato brings this out in the dialogues,

31:49.520 --> 31:56.160
when we can do that with each other. So it's not only within my senses, but between how

31:56.160 --> 32:00.960
all of us are trying to make sense. Think about how that massively increases the trustworthiness.

32:01.760 --> 32:06.720
Aristotle treated it as one of the three marks of realness. If you had rational,

32:06.720 --> 32:11.760
intersubjective agreement, then it must be real. We know that that's not right. Things we can get

32:11.760 --> 32:17.760
that agreement, like you said, Hitler, and it can still be false. But that's why you shouldn't

32:17.760 --> 32:23.360
confuse trustworthiness with certainty. But trustworthiness is valuable. I mean, it's very valuable.

32:23.360 --> 32:32.640
And so we want to share with other people what's happening because it makes it more real for us

32:32.640 --> 32:42.080
in a deep sense. And the way you afford that, what are you converging? You're converging attention.

32:42.080 --> 32:46.720
You're converging attention. So that would be my explanation for that.

32:46.720 --> 32:51.280
Yeah, that's a really wonderful, I mean, when you say it that way, it makes so much sense.

32:51.520 --> 32:56.400
It's just completely reasonable to understand that if you have a group of people and you're

32:56.400 --> 33:01.200
attending to something, it increases the reality of the thing you're attending to because you're

33:01.200 --> 33:05.760
constantly aware that, okay, so here's a hundred people, they are all attending to the thing I'm

33:05.760 --> 33:10.880
attending to. So maybe I need to attend to it. Like maybe there's something real about what's

33:10.880 --> 33:18.000
happening or more real than a more idiosyncratic moment, let's say. But this says a lot about

33:18.000 --> 33:24.960
our situation right now, because I have children. And to imagine they spent months and months sitting

33:24.960 --> 33:31.200
alone on Zoom watching their teacher or even in class with masks on where you don't see other

33:31.200 --> 33:36.800
people's faces. This has a major effect, I imagine has a major effect on their capacity to pay

33:36.800 --> 33:42.720
attention and to kind of make sense of what's going on. I think it has, I mean, I think our

33:42.720 --> 33:46.000
children are going to be especially sensitive to it, especially young children. But I think it

33:46.080 --> 33:54.640
has an impact on everybody. So one of the things, because I was talking to people during COVID about

33:54.640 --> 34:00.720
this, and one of the adjectives that kept coming up, one of these two adjectives, things seem

34:00.720 --> 34:10.320
unreal or they seem surreal. There's a sense of losing touch with reality because the capacities

34:10.320 --> 34:17.680
for joint attention were being truncated or they were being transferred to this weird kind of joint

34:17.680 --> 34:23.280
attention that we have right here right now, which is very odd for us. It's a very odd kind of joint

34:23.280 --> 34:29.120
attention. Yeah, and that gives me another layer of understanding of the Floyd protest, because

34:29.120 --> 34:32.880
for me, it's been something that I've been trying to understand so much. But that all of a sudden

34:32.880 --> 34:39.600
puts another layer on it, which is that people for months had been starved of joint attention in many

34:39.600 --> 34:45.600
ways, whether it was sports or religion or whatever clubs that people participated in,

34:45.600 --> 34:50.560
whatever concerts people went to. And it wasn't necessarily a conscious thing, but they were

34:50.560 --> 34:55.280
just starved for attention. And then all of a sudden, when this point of attention, very salient

34:55.280 --> 35:01.680
point of attention appeared on their horizon and the opportunity to kind of join together and celebrate

35:01.680 --> 35:07.360
or, I mean, it wasn't celebrate, but in the general sense of just kind of getting angry about the

35:07.440 --> 35:14.640
same thing. And so it just exploded into these moments. I think that's true. I mean,

35:14.640 --> 35:22.240
you and I talked about it besides whatever, and I think there were legitimate reasons about

35:22.240 --> 35:29.120
social justice and about inequity. And I think those are real. But I think above and beyond that,

35:29.120 --> 35:34.160
there was something else that was being poured into this. And it's still reverberated through.

35:34.800 --> 35:40.560
I think you see that in there's many instances of this kind of hunger. One of the things we're

35:40.560 --> 35:46.000
discovering about attention is not only is it bottom up, it grabs our attention, it goes from

35:46.000 --> 35:51.680
features to the Gestalt and top down, we can direct it from sort of larger Gestalt to specific

35:51.680 --> 35:58.240
details. But there's also what you might call a historical dimension. So attention is not only

35:58.320 --> 36:04.480
organizing up, down, it's organizing past, present. So your previous history of what you're

36:04.480 --> 36:09.840
paying attention to has an impact on what will jump out for you as salient right now.

36:11.040 --> 36:15.920
And so with Tim Leathercraft and Blake Richards and I, we tried to actually

36:15.920 --> 36:19.840
put that into our relevance realization model that there's these opposing tendencies

36:21.280 --> 36:27.520
to try and stay with something if it's sort of similar to your past patterns of attention.

36:27.520 --> 36:32.560
But there's also good evidence for what's called inhibition on return. We also want to move away

36:32.560 --> 36:36.800
from what we've paying a lot of attention to. And so these two things are playing each other out.

36:36.800 --> 36:40.320
And I think if you push the attentional pendulum, if you'll allow me that metaphor,

36:40.320 --> 36:44.720
too far one way and starve people, there's going to be, there's going to be a rebound

36:45.600 --> 36:52.080
the other way people are going to hunger for, like you said, something that can be

36:52.240 --> 37:00.160
co-realized through joint attention. Yeah. And that can also make you understand the problem of,

37:01.200 --> 37:08.320
let's say, ill practice asceticism, right? Where that if you're not careful, asceticism can actually

37:08.320 --> 37:13.680
lead to, to excesses back and, you know, like the idea of a diet, right? The idea of people

37:13.680 --> 37:19.840
dieting where they, they, they're able, they try to just like not pay attention to the thing.

37:20.400 --> 37:25.920
And then all of a sudden it just cracks and, you know, you're coming. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly.

37:25.920 --> 37:34.160
Exactly. That's a very good analogy. I mean, the thing is to try to get the, the virtue,

37:34.160 --> 37:39.680
the golden mean of a schesis, right? Of, of, of discipline, of spiritual exercises.

37:40.960 --> 37:44.880
Well, and the schesis in the traditional sense is always a redirecting of attention.

37:44.960 --> 37:50.560
Yes. You hear it all the time. People say you don't just fast. If you fast and you don't pray,

37:50.560 --> 37:54.160
you're in trouble. Like you're going to be in way more trouble than you were before you started

37:54.160 --> 37:59.120
fasting. Like when you fast, you have to go to church, pray, you have to redirect your attention

37:59.120 --> 38:03.440
or else it's not, not only is it not going to work, but it's going to be damaging to your soul.

38:03.440 --> 38:09.280
That's why I argue that we shouldn't just practice in the mindfulness traditions. And this is western.

38:09.280 --> 38:15.360
It's not, it's, it's, it's not, it's not, you know, it's ethnocentric, right? We shouldn't

38:15.360 --> 38:20.480
just practice meditation, right? Which is a kind of thought fast. We should also practice

38:20.480 --> 38:25.040
contemplation, which is, and now once you've opened up that space through the thought fast,

38:25.040 --> 38:30.880
what can you theoria? What can you contemplate that you couldn't see before? That's part of that

38:30.880 --> 38:37.360
why Leo and I made that argument about the fact that we, we've, we've, we've reduced all this whole

38:37.360 --> 38:42.560
ecology to this one practice and then we've reduced that practice. Like the definition of

38:42.560 --> 38:48.320
mindfulness as, you know, paying attention to the present moment, that's, that's not what sati means,

38:48.320 --> 38:52.800
right? And I understand that's good language of praying, the cabbage in used, but that's not

38:52.800 --> 38:57.680
good language of explaining what's going on when you're trying to meditate, for example.

38:58.800 --> 39:02.320
All right. So here's going to be my, this is going to be my big push on you here. So get ready.

39:02.400 --> 39:10.080
That's fine. You don't have to push on me. All right. So, so human beings have capacity for

39:10.080 --> 39:17.120
attention and it seems like that capacity for attention has a certain priority and, and that

39:17.120 --> 39:25.360
priority seems to be personal. Like that is that we pay attention to people first. Faces. Yes,

39:25.360 --> 39:31.840
we pay attention to faces, to people. And then, then we can pay attention to more abstract things,

39:31.920 --> 39:37.920
but those abstract things, even those abstract things often end up concentrating in a person,

39:37.920 --> 39:42.080
right? So you, you, you want to train, but you can't. So you get a coach and then all of a sudden

39:42.080 --> 39:45.920
you can train. Like, why is it that you can train because you have a coach, but you can train if

39:45.920 --> 39:51.840
you don't have a coach? It's because the coach is focusing your desire for attention into something

39:52.720 --> 39:58.960
into a person that's, that's actually communicating and directing and, and becoming like a node for,

39:58.960 --> 40:06.080
for even the more abstract telos that you have. And so this is, this is, I guess this is my big

40:06.080 --> 40:12.080
question in terms of the manner in which reality exists, which is that I've been positing, like

40:12.080 --> 40:18.560
I've been really working towards positing that reality has, even though I agree with you that

40:18.560 --> 40:24.720
you could say that the infinite is transpersonal, but that as this infinite manifests itself in

40:24.720 --> 40:31.200
the world, then it tends to take personal, it tends to culminate into personal beings.

40:32.240 --> 40:38.160
And so my question is always for you is always to think like the idea of transpersonal, not

40:38.160 --> 40:42.800
transpersonal in the sense of beyond humans, but I mean, I mean transpersonal in the sense of

40:42.800 --> 40:47.520
beyond humans, but personal beings that are not human, let's say the idea of angels and the

40:47.520 --> 40:55.200
idea of bodhisattvas or the idea of, of God's little G gods as being the manner in which reality

40:55.200 --> 40:58.480
presents itself to us and the manner in which we encounter it, let's say.

40:59.680 --> 41:02.880
Well, and Paul's made us, Paul medically has made a similar argument.

41:02.880 --> 41:04.800
Okay, all right. I didn't know that.

41:04.800 --> 41:10.880
He asked me to critique it. He invoked Pascal's difference between the spirit of geometry and

41:10.880 --> 41:15.600
the spirit of finesse and his argument of the spirit of finesse is, is most appropriately

41:15.680 --> 41:22.240
afforded in personal relationships. And, and so let me try and first of all strengthen your position

41:22.240 --> 41:25.360
for you before I demolish it. No, no.

41:30.400 --> 41:34.480
So like we're talking about joint attention and I was talking about its development and you can

41:34.480 --> 41:40.880
link this to Bogotsky and to a lot of like, so let me give you another example of prioritizing

41:40.880 --> 41:45.280
and paying attention. This is an experiment that's done. I've seen the video of this experiment.

41:46.000 --> 41:49.600
So give me a moment and then I'm going to go somewhere with this and you're going to see

41:50.640 --> 41:56.480
how it's going to strengthen your point and then, and then, and then I'll, I'll, I'll offer my

41:56.480 --> 42:02.640
cautions. I'm not trying to demolish. I don't want to do that. So what you have is you have the,

42:03.280 --> 42:08.080
so what you have is there's two participants in the experiment. There's a chimp, an adult chimp

42:08.080 --> 42:12.320
and a four year old girl. Of course, this was replicated with lots of individuals. I'm just

42:12.320 --> 42:16.960
using this for the purposes of narrative, right? And you have this box, right? And you have the

42:16.960 --> 42:21.280
adult come in and first of all, you show the chimp and the box has all these buttons and levers

42:21.280 --> 42:27.120
and the human does this very complicated pattern of pushing buttons and levers. And at the end,

42:27.120 --> 42:31.760
a candy comes out and eats it. And what's really fascinating is the chimp watches once and then

42:31.760 --> 42:38.080
replicates the pattern and gets the chocolate or whatever the candy and you go, wow, that's

42:38.080 --> 42:41.920
impressive. And there's some, there's some evidence that their ability, their working memory attention

42:41.920 --> 42:46.720
is stronger than ours because we sacrifice a lot for language. And then you bring in the four year

42:46.720 --> 42:51.440
old girl and you sort of, I picture myself as cheering. I've got a little human flag, go human,

42:51.440 --> 42:59.760
right? And they show the girls this and she just takes one and she replicates it and she gets the

42:59.760 --> 43:04.720
candy and you go, wow, that's cool. Now, and this is the experiment. Now you bring in the box,

43:04.720 --> 43:08.720
but now the box is plastic and completely transparent, all the same levers and buttons.

43:08.800 --> 43:12.720
You bring the chimp in, the human adult goes through all of this and it's clear that the only

43:12.720 --> 43:16.720
thing that releases the candy is the last action. All the other actions do nothing.

43:18.240 --> 43:22.000
So that you does this and then the chimp and the chimp sort of looks at the human being like

43:22.880 --> 43:28.800
and just pushes pulls the last thing and gets the candy and you go, oh, that's smart. And you

43:28.800 --> 43:34.240
bring in the four year old girl and she watches and the adult does this and she can see that only

43:34.240 --> 43:38.240
the last thing releases the candy. What does she do? She repeats everything the adult did.

43:39.120 --> 43:44.880
And you go, oh, are four year olds stupider than chimp? And then you realize, no, no, no,

43:45.520 --> 43:52.000
the human is playing the long game. The girl is thinking, the girl is thinking, obviously,

43:52.000 --> 43:59.440
it's not she's thinking, this adult probably sees things I cannot yet see. This adult probably

43:59.440 --> 44:06.960
knows things that I do not yet know. I'm going to imitate them because that will allow me to

44:07.040 --> 44:11.920
transcend my own perspective. It's very hard to transcend your perspective from within your

44:11.920 --> 44:18.240
perspective. But if a child imitates an adult's perspective, they get the capacity to transcend

44:18.240 --> 44:24.080
their own bias. And what and Bogotsky's theory is, and here's the joint attention and the looping,

44:24.080 --> 44:31.040
we do this enough until I can do it without you being around. I do it imagineally. I imagine

44:31.760 --> 44:36.080
in the sense that you're there. I don't mean an image, but my metacognition is basic. Well,

44:36.560 --> 44:40.240
think about all the imagistic language. What do you do in metacognition? You rise above your

44:40.240 --> 44:44.640
cognition and you look at it. There's no space there. So what we're doing is we're

44:44.640 --> 44:50.960
imagineally augmenting our ability. And that's what internalization is. I and you, we got a capacity

44:50.960 --> 44:57.120
to become metacognitive, aware of ourselves and transcend ourselves by imitatively internalizing

44:57.120 --> 45:02.720
other people. And did you see what that strengthens your argument deeply? Because it means I

45:03.600 --> 45:12.640
my capacity for self-transcendence, development, transformation comes for how deeply I can

45:12.640 --> 45:18.800
internalize you. And then you pair that with Polania's idea that I can internalize you better.

45:18.800 --> 45:24.560
The more I can indwell you, the more I can see things from your perspective, the more I can,

45:24.560 --> 45:30.720
right? So I want to indwell you as deeply as possible. And that allows me to internalize

45:30.720 --> 45:36.640
you and vice versa, hopefully, too. Hopefully, it's not one way and consumatory, right? And what

45:36.640 --> 45:44.240
that means is that my capacity for self-transcendence is deeply dependent on a medic ability in a

45:44.240 --> 45:49.360
profound way. And it's a two-way. It's this joint attention, this looping, the sentry motor,

45:49.440 --> 45:59.840
this mind-site resonance. And so it's deeply within us that we transcend by internalizing

46:00.720 --> 46:06.880
personifications. And I'll use that as a neutral term. Now, I think that strengthens your case

46:06.880 --> 46:13.680
tremendously. I think so. I think definitely, I think so. And I think that you can understand

46:13.680 --> 46:19.200
that as, if you think about it, bottom up as scaling up, right? As scaling up in terms of

46:19.200 --> 46:27.040
personalities into kind of personalities that are beyond just the person I meet during a meeting

46:27.040 --> 46:34.000
or whatever, but that they would become figures of personal attention that are communal, right?

46:34.000 --> 46:41.360
That can be something like a god or like an angel or something which binds our community together.

46:41.360 --> 46:51.360
And so we imitate Athena or we imitate Aries. Very much. Sorry. I said very much. And if we

46:51.360 --> 46:57.520
have a hyper-objects of persons, like people gathered into hyper-objects, like Athens being,

46:57.520 --> 47:02.960
right, and Athena is a way of, so George Herbert Mead had this idea of the generalized other,

47:02.960 --> 47:08.080
right? So that thing that the little girl just did with the adult. Imagine trying to do that on

47:08.080 --> 47:12.960
a baseball team. This is George Herbert Mead's model, right? And trying to get that individual

47:12.960 --> 47:18.400
personally tailored to each person, that's very, very hard, right? And because you're constantly

47:18.400 --> 47:23.280
shifting who you're. And so Mead argued that we create what he called the generalized other.

47:23.280 --> 47:29.360
We create kind of this model that is somehow the intersection of all these individual models.

47:29.360 --> 47:33.600
And by relating to that, I can effectively coordinate with all these other people and they

47:33.600 --> 47:40.480
with me, the generalized other. So you can think of Athena as, Athena is not just this.

47:41.920 --> 47:47.040
But she is a generalized other of Athens that people could internalize

47:47.040 --> 47:52.560
to become an Athenian in a very profound sense. Yeah. So we're talking about a bottom up.

47:55.440 --> 47:59.200
I think in our context, it's easier to talk about a bottom up also to help

47:59.200 --> 48:02.000
understand its relationship to like say something like cognitive science.

48:02.720 --> 48:07.920
And so is there, this is also something that I'm interested in. Is there a way in which that

48:07.920 --> 48:16.320
generalized other would find a head in an embodied person? So take the baseball team,

48:16.320 --> 48:21.920
right? So the baseball team creates a generalized other through which to act. But then that

48:21.920 --> 48:27.680
generalized other will be kind of embodied in the team captain. So it's like the team captain is

48:27.680 --> 48:33.200
kind of raised up and named. And then he's not the generalized other, but he becomes something

48:33.200 --> 48:43.760
like the place through which we can attend. And then it'll kind of stream down into the team.

48:43.760 --> 48:49.520
So the team can cohere. A way of thinking about it is the formal cause of the generalized other

48:49.520 --> 48:54.320
gets transformed into an efficient cause that we can actually have joint attention upon,

48:54.320 --> 49:00.000
something like that. Is that fair to what you're saying? No, that makes sense. And you could explain

49:00.000 --> 49:05.760
all the traditions of the kind of the God embodied in the king, let's say, that you find in Egypt and

49:05.760 --> 49:13.840
in all these different cultures, the idea of how the, or the emperor, the idea of the divine emperor,

49:13.840 --> 49:19.680
all of these ways in which, because Christian, I obviously don't agree with doing this, but

49:19.680 --> 49:24.000
when they worship the emperor, they didn't worship the emperor, right? They worshiped the

49:24.000 --> 49:30.720
emperor's genius. Yes, exactly. And so they worshiped like a transpersonal version of the

49:30.720 --> 49:37.280
emperor, which was embodied in the emperor as a focal point for our attention. But nobody thought

49:37.280 --> 49:45.280
that the physical emperor was, let's say, a guy. He was a guy, right? There was something above

49:45.280 --> 49:50.640
him, which was calling us into our communion, you could say. Yeah, there's the empire, and the

49:50.640 --> 49:55.760
empire is a hyper-object. And everybody's prosperity and peace depended on being in

49:55.760 --> 50:00.800
right relationship with that hyper-object. But hyper-objects require, like we just,

50:00.800 --> 50:05.840
they require some, right, something like that. They require a face, or they require a personal

50:05.840 --> 50:10.560
being that we can relate to. That we can relate to so that we can properly do the internalization.

50:10.560 --> 50:14.560
So we can do the, we can imagineally, not imaginary, we can imagineally

50:15.760 --> 50:21.360
enter into right relationship with the empire. We can be devoted to the empire and internalize the

50:21.360 --> 50:28.000
empire's values and normativity by being devoted to the genius, the capacity of the emperor to

50:28.000 --> 50:35.680
lead and be the voice of the empire. Yes, very much. And for me, I would say that another great,

50:35.680 --> 50:40.160
this is how I've tried to understand, and again, I don't mean this disrespectfully,

50:40.160 --> 50:44.720
however, I've tried to understand prophecy. I don't see prophecy as fortune telling.

50:44.720 --> 50:50.080
I don't see it like that. I see prophecy as doing exactly what you're saying, that the

50:50.080 --> 50:57.760
prophet somehow takes something and becomes, right, the vehicle of the form. There's a tradition

50:57.760 --> 51:03.440
in later Neoplatonism of distinguishing between the form and the vehicle by which the form can come

51:03.440 --> 51:10.320
into efficient causation, right? And this is what, this was one of the origins of this,

51:10.320 --> 51:15.280
the idea that's now become this new age idea of the astral body and all that, the Akama,

51:15.280 --> 51:21.760
was this, that there's a part of us that, right? And the ontology is not important. The point I'm

51:21.760 --> 51:26.720
trying to make is that there was this distinction between the form and the vehicle, right? So,

51:27.840 --> 51:32.320
you know, there's the form of the good, but it needs a particular vehicle by which it instantiates

51:32.320 --> 51:38.400
itself in a human being. Yeah, that makes sense. Because then that idea of prophecy

51:38.400 --> 51:44.800
is far closer to my own understanding, which is that prophecies don't just predict the future.

51:45.680 --> 51:51.520
They predict the future to the extent that they manifest a pattern. Like they're actually showing

51:51.520 --> 51:57.440
you a pattern of how reality manifests itself to you. And in that context, and of course,

51:57.440 --> 52:02.800
it predicts the future because it kind of is able to pull out of even of how a society lays itself

52:02.800 --> 52:08.720
out and is able to understand that here are some inevitable patterns in which, in how something will,

52:08.720 --> 52:15.520
like an identity will go to its end, let's say. So then it imagistically embodies through these

52:15.520 --> 52:21.200
kind of very, very imagistic stories how, you know, what that means. And that's very much,

52:22.080 --> 52:26.720
like the platonic notion of a form is not some sort of like the platonic notion of a triangle

52:26.720 --> 52:32.240
isn't like a perfect triangle. It's much better. And this is happening. And I'm actually involved

52:32.240 --> 52:36.240
in this work to try and think of the form, the platonic forms phenomenologically, like

52:36.960 --> 52:43.520
ideas from Arlo Ponti, like, I can show you this, right? And you never see the object.

52:44.240 --> 52:49.680
You always see aspects of it. Yeah, yeah, there's multi, it's multi aspectual, but there's a

52:49.680 --> 52:54.400
through line. They're not fragmented. And that through line also looks up to the through line

52:54.400 --> 53:01.680
of yourself, which is also a through line of the multi aspects of you, right? But the through

53:01.680 --> 53:08.480
line of the multi aspectuality is not another aspect. That's the mistake, right? It's not another

53:08.480 --> 53:16.400
aspect, the form. But what do we do? What we do is we usually draw things from a standard position

53:16.400 --> 53:23.200
because that's a vehicle that's supposed to stand in for something that we can't actually capture

53:23.280 --> 53:29.600
in a picture. So the form comes into a vehicle by which we can face it to some of our language.

53:29.600 --> 53:33.760
Is that lining up with what you're... No, that makes a lot of sense. And I think the things

53:33.760 --> 53:38.960
you're saying are going to be very useful for materialists to understand what it is that

53:38.960 --> 53:43.120
we're talking about. I always have that fear that some people watch our videos and have no idea what

53:43.120 --> 53:49.520
we're even talking about. But I think what you're saying is really appropriate. And so

53:50.480 --> 53:55.600
this is like, I think that even until now, the way you're talking about it and the way that I'm

53:55.600 --> 54:02.400
talking about it, being cautious in the sense of, let's say, talk about imaginably interacting with

54:02.400 --> 54:11.520
these beings that are... But the question is, like my proposition is something like those

54:11.520 --> 54:18.160
beings exist as much as you do, right? The transpersonal, like the beings that bind the

54:18.160 --> 54:24.160
community together and become... Take up a face and become principalities for the world to exist,

54:24.160 --> 54:28.400
they have as much existence as a person. They just exist at another level, let's say.

54:29.840 --> 54:35.440
So first of all... That's the big... That's my big... That maybe is the... Like, you can say that that's

54:35.440 --> 54:39.520
what makes me an explicitly religious person. It's something like that, you know?

54:39.520 --> 54:45.360
Yeah. First of all, let me try and give a lot of ground towards that position, given what I've

54:45.360 --> 54:50.400
already said. So what I should therefore be relatively consistent with. I've already admitted

54:50.400 --> 54:59.360
the existence of hyper-objects. I've already... The work I do on Deologos, that there's...

55:00.480 --> 55:04.960
A dynamical system takes shape. That's something beyond all of the individual

55:04.960 --> 55:10.480
consciousnesses and personalities there. When we were talking with Jordan and Bishop,

55:11.680 --> 55:15.040
I would use this language. I don't think it's inappropriate. I'm using it in a Greek fashion.

55:15.040 --> 55:20.560
There was a Logos that was present beyond all of us and we started getting caught up in it

55:20.560 --> 55:26.000
and following it. And I think that's completely appropriate to say. And I've experienced that.

55:26.000 --> 55:30.560
I've seen people from religious and non-religious experiences in circling and other things. They

55:30.560 --> 55:34.640
encounter that. I want to acknowledge all of that. I also want to acknowledge...

55:37.280 --> 55:43.520
And this comes out of Corbin and Ibn Arabi and a whole bunch of work.

55:45.280 --> 55:48.720
You know what a heads-up display is like in a cockpit for a pilot?

55:49.200 --> 55:57.840
So the pilot can't afford to look down, divert their attention. And so what you do is you project

55:57.840 --> 56:03.120
onto the screen a bunch of things so they can actually look through the screen and get the

56:03.120 --> 56:09.360
information at the same time. Or like Pokemon Go where you have augmented reality. Here's a

56:09.360 --> 56:13.440
proposal to you to... Now, I'm doing it in good faith. I'm trying to move towards what you said.

56:13.440 --> 56:20.240
So give me a bit of patience. If we properly distinguish between the imaginal and the imaginary,

56:20.240 --> 56:25.680
that the imaginal is transjective and not subjective the way the imaginary is in Corbin's

56:25.680 --> 56:32.160
sense, the imaginal, I think it's very reasonable. And Dan and I published on this. We see the

56:32.160 --> 56:39.360
scientists doing this for the imaginal augmentation of reality. So for example, let me give me a

56:39.360 --> 56:44.560
concrete example. The scientists are getting these flat black and white pictures from the

56:44.560 --> 56:49.840
rovers on Mars. What they're looking for in the researchers are people who can get the sense of

56:49.840 --> 56:56.560
being on Mars, of being the rover, like seeing as the rover does. And what do they do? By the way,

56:56.560 --> 57:00.720
what does the scientists do? They do this loop. First of all, they identify with the rover.

57:00.720 --> 57:04.880
They don't say, move the rover there. They say, we should go there. The rover is we.

57:05.600 --> 57:10.400
Right? And then they also, so they indwell the rover, but they also internalize it.

57:10.400 --> 57:15.840
So you'll get a scientist saying, so say, oh, this is what we need to do. Put your phone front

57:15.840 --> 57:20.880
and she's on a wheelchair. And she does this. These are the, we need to do this. And she enacts

57:20.880 --> 57:28.560
and embodies the rover. And then you'll get these literal rocket scientists saying stuff

57:28.560 --> 57:34.320
like this is almost a verbatim quote, Jonathan. You know, I was in my gardening and my right

57:34.320 --> 57:40.400
wrist kept getting stuck. And then I came to the lab and spirit. That's ironically one of the names

57:40.400 --> 57:46.160
of the rovers. It's right wheel kept getting stuck. And I don't know. I don't believe in magic,

57:46.160 --> 57:51.840
but you know, there's some kind of sympathy, ha, ha, ha. And they laugh, right? And that's what I

57:51.840 --> 57:56.000
mean. And what do they do with those pictures in order to do that? You know, those wonderful

57:56.000 --> 58:00.320
panoramic pictures they send back, they're not for the science, they're for us. Yeah, what they do

58:00.320 --> 58:05.200
is they take these pictures and they color them and they scribble on them and they mark them all

58:05.200 --> 58:11.440
out for a test. He calls it drawing as and all of that imaginal work allows them to draw out so

58:11.440 --> 58:18.240
that they can be on Mars and be the rover. This is what we've recently published on. This is not

58:18.240 --> 58:24.880
some, you know, airy fairy stuff. I think, right? I know what that's like when I'm doing Tai Chi.

58:24.960 --> 58:31.440
When I'm trying, right, that Tai Chi, they'll say, like, you know, like imagine that you're pushing

58:31.440 --> 58:38.240
on a ball and you go, why? And then you do that, you go, oh, that's why. And by doing the imaginal

58:38.240 --> 58:44.480
thing, you interact with the world in the right way so you see things you wouldn't otherwise see.

58:44.480 --> 58:49.440
Does that make sense? The imaginal augmentation? Yeah, no, that makes sense. Okay, now let's go

58:49.440 --> 58:53.440
with what we talked about before, that we can have distributed cognition and we can have shared

58:53.440 --> 58:59.200
attention and we can have shared imaginal augmentation that puts us into reality with hyperobjects.

59:00.240 --> 59:07.520
I think that is, again, you might find this too reductionist, but for me, I can see a lot of

59:07.520 --> 59:14.160
what I call the serious play of religion doing exactly that, right? You got this shared joint

59:14.160 --> 59:19.920
attention and you're getting the distributed cognition and you're allowing for that shared

59:19.920 --> 59:25.760
imaginal augmentation of reality perception, ontological depth reception, so that people can

59:25.760 --> 59:33.280
see and realize hyperobjects that are otherwise invisible to them. Like Mars is when all I give

59:33.280 --> 59:39.120
you is the flat photograph. If you'll allow me analogy, religion is taking the flat photographs

59:39.120 --> 59:46.720
that were given and turning them into me being present on Mars in a way that allows me to do

59:46.720 --> 59:53.440
the science. I can't do the science on Mars unless I get that sense of presence. Okay, so then

59:54.160 --> 59:58.480
that's not everything you want. No, it's not everything I want, but so would you apply that

59:58.480 --> 01:00:04.320
process to you? That is, would you, because you, because when I think my difficulty is that

01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:11.920
I'm not sure in your model, like if you have this idea that we are, let's say, intelligent beings

01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:19.120
and then, let's say, and then these other beings that we're talking about, right, they're kind of

01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:25.680
projections of our intelligence or whether or not those beings, those intelligent beings exist

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:32.720
as much as I do, as in the same process that is like, let's say I also have all these parts and

01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:38.720
all these thoughts and all these distraction and attentions and aspects of me that are

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:45.440
coordinating and are being pulled into the same attentions in order for me to exist as a

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:50.800
unified being, let's say. That's exactly, by the way, what Mohl says attention is, it's cognitive

01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:58.560
unison. And if you were to ask me, do I think, and I think this is a very platonic model,

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:04.480
do I think that distributed cognition has a collective intelligence that is more than the

01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:11.680
sum of the individual intelligences within it? Yes. I think that's, this goes back to Hitchens,

01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:16.880
back in, you know, cognition of the world, who navigates a ship? There's no person that navigates

01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:24.080
a ship. It's a crew and a bunch of equipment and that system has the intelligence to grasp

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:29.200
the hyper-object of the ocean and the hyper-object of the ship and navigate and coordinate them

01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:36.400
together. And there's been some pretty gruesome experiments showing that collective intelligence

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:40.320
can do things that individual intelligence, there's a person who literally, I don't know how this

01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:46.800
got through ethics, wired rats together so that their brains were wired and that group of rats

01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:53.920
could solve problems that the individual rats couldn't solve. Really? Yeah. That doesn't surprise us.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:01.920
Think about the power of the Internet that is given by distributed computation. No computer

01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:07.280
can do this, but the network can create this hyper-object, you called it earlier, a God,

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:16.160
right? That is like so powerful for us in so many ways. So do I think that, and I think this is one

01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:21.520
of the great insights of the platonic idea of dialectic. It's not the Hegelian dialectic.

01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:28.480
The platonic dialectic is we can learn an art, and that's how it's thought, about coordinating

01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:34.880
individual cognition into distributed cognition so we can access collective intelligence and perhaps

01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:40.800
transform it into, participate, better way of putting it, participate in its transformation

01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:46.720
into collective wisdom. Yeah. I mean, I think it's interesting because there are these,

01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:53.040
even in the Thomistic theories about the idea that every time two beings are in relation with each

01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:58.400
other, they have an angel. So if I'm talking to you and I'm actually in communion with you,

01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:06.240
then there's an angel which is acting as a principality and becoming the intelligence

01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:11.440
into which our communion is rising up into that intelligence. I would add one more thing to it,

01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:15.920
which also strengthens your case. You've heard me talking about this a lot.

01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:25.040
It's not just emergence up. There's not only the ruling in of the modeling,

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:30.160
there's the ruling out, the emanation that is constraining how these things can take shape.

01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:35.040
They take certain shapes. That's why there are these reliable persistent patterns for good and

01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:40.800
for ill. But there are these reliable, like you mentioned it in prophecy, the prophet can say,

01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:45.920
like, there's reliable ways this can go. This can go this way and it can go this way. And he's

01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:53.200
often addressing almost always, I'm sorry, sometimes the prophets were she, but mostly

01:03:53.200 --> 01:04:00.240
they were he. Deborah was a prophet, I know that. But they are almost always identifying

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:05.280
like Israel in the collective, not just sometimes they address the king, but often the king is just

01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:10.560
the representative for Israel. And there's a spirit that they're trying to address.

01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:18.240
Right. And so I would say all of that. Now, where you and I probably disagree,

01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:22.480
and I'll just, all right, so I'm trying to do Genuine Deologous. I'm trying to.

01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:23.040
Thank you.

01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:30.560
Yeah. It is, you know, whether or not I don't think I have to be really careful.

01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:41.360
So I think there is a proper way of talking about something like God, you know, in Spinoza's sense

01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:47.200
or in the nontheistic sense, your notion that there's something like the pattern of

01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:52.800
relevance realization in reality realization that is analogous to the relevance realization

01:04:52.800 --> 01:05:00.560
and cognition, I took, I think that seriously, I think that's right. But I'm, I, and this is where

01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:08.720
I don't think there's a consciousness for that collective intelligence.

01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:18.640
And I don't, and I don't think there's an agency to it in the same way we understand

01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:22.640
the agency of living things. There might be something analogous. I'm open. And by the way,

01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:27.200
this is not just, this is not just me. And you'll find this amusing given our how we came to know

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:34.160
each other. Many people talk about the power of the collective intelligence of distributed

01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:40.560
cognition as a zombie intelligence. Oh, really? Yeah, that's the term that's used. So the idea is

01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:48.960
that, that consciousness, one of its properties might be that it only exists within a determinant

01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:55.520
range, the things that you, so even within your own brain, within your own body embodied brain,

01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:59.120
like you're not conscious of many levels, but you're not conscious of your neurons,

01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:04.640
you're not confident, right? And there's lots of things at a higher level, like these hyperobjects,

01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:09.600
you can't be conscious of them, you can be conscious of reference to them. But I can't,

01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:14.720
there's no way in which I can be conscious of global warming. Like I can't do it, right? It

01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:19.040
doesn't make any sense. I can think about it, and I can be conscious of my thinking of it,

01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:22.880
but I can't be conscious of global warming the way I can be conscious of this object.

01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:29.440
So wouldn't the fact that for thousands of years, and our let's say period being a complete

01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:35.040
exception to that, for thousands of years, communities encountered these transpersonal

01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:41.920
beings as being both conscious and having agency, and that they represented them as such, and talked

01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:47.120
about them as such, and worshiped them as such, and etc, etc. Like even without talking about

01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:51.760
God in the supreme kind of infinite way, like I don't want to talk about that too much. I want

01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:56.880
to talk about the intermediary beings, they're easier to keep, they're easier to talk about.

01:06:57.760 --> 01:07:07.120
I just wanted to be clear that I wasn't trying to deny a divine or sacred status to things above

01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:13.520
us. I wanted to be clear about that. I wanted to be very clear about that. We'll put that aside,

01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:21.920
as long as you acknowledge that that's a point I wanted to make. And you won't agree with it,

01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:28.080
there's a brilliant anthropologist out there, Lerman, and she wrote a book and she has a whole

01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:36.240
bunch of people, How God Becomes Real, and she talks about what you would call gods or spirits

01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:43.120
become real for people. And she talks about the fact that we have these two different

01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:48.160
senses of real. We may have three given that hyper-objects are real for us, and maybe they

01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:51.600
all bleed together in important ways. That's something that phenomenology I'm trying to

01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:56.960
work out right now with other people. But she talks about that these beings are real, but not

01:07:56.960 --> 01:08:03.520
in the same way that other things are real for us. Sorry, this might come off as disrespectful,

01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:07.200
but I'm just quoting, and she's not being disrespectful either, but one of the groups

01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:12.640
she was studying was a group of evangelical Christians and for whom Jesus is real in the

01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:16.960
way you're talking about. Now, I know that Jesus is also part of the Trinity, but I'm just trying

01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:21.600
to call it the spirit of Christ or something like that, whatever. And she said,

01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:28.640
Jesus is real, but you don't ask him to do your homework. That's what one evangelical

01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:34.000
Christian said, which was like, whoa, that's a really interesting thing to say. You can ask

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:37.120
him to help you do your homework, but you don't say, I'm not going to do my homework, I'm going to

01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:42.000
ask Jesus to do it. Now, there could be for moral or religious reasons, but it was clear in that

01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:50.560
what the person was trying to convey, they were trying to convey this sense that the way these

01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:56.320
beings interact with, for lack of a better word, physical reality is not the way physical things

01:08:56.320 --> 01:09:01.120
interact with physical reality. Yeah, but it's a hierarchy. So it's like you could say something

01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:09.360
like your finger doesn't ask you to clot the cut on it. Your finger doesn't ask you to clot the

01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:14.640
blood in your finger, but you're still doing it through your body. That is, your body is the

01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:20.080
manner in which you manifest yourself. And so that's why he's saying, Jesus doesn't do your homework.

01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:25.120
You do your homework, but you can do that in a way that's participating in the body of Christ,

01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:32.800
you could say. Right. But notice what's happening there. That seems to mean that their

01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:40.080
realness as presence is always vectored through us as participating in them.

01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:45.760
Right, because we're like parts of the body. Just like your finger is a part of you,

01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:51.360
then we are part of Christ. Christ manifests himself. That's why he's like a higher consciousness.

01:09:52.320 --> 01:10:00.320
Totally. So what I would then say is, for example, you don't think that because we've

01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:05.520
networked all of the computers together, that the internet has consciousness, do you?

01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:10.800
I'm pretty sure there's a God behind that. I'm sorry. I'm going to freak people out by saying

01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:15.040
that. I've been pointing to it very closely, actually. I do think the internet is acting

01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:20.640
as a body for a God. I do think so. And I think that the fact that it's moving without

01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:27.200
anybody being able to stop it or control it or direct it completely. I agree with you on that.

01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:31.840
So I agree on that. And that's a tricky thing, because Jung said that's the definition of spirit.

01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:39.760
If it acts on its own, if it has a life of its own and a mind of its own, that's definitely when

01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:47.120
we are liable to attribute spirit to it. But I would say just again, people have also

01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:53.680
perennially done that with forests and with oceans and rivers. And I don't think that rivers have

01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:58.240
consciousness or forests have consciousness. Well, it's not the river that has consciousness.

01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:03.440
It's the angel that has consciousness. Just like your hand doesn't have consciousness.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.600
It's the fullness of you in relationship to your hand that has consciousness.

01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:12.960
Yeah, but see, and this is where we differ. I don't think there's a way of separating my

01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:18.480
consciousness from my embodiment. No, I agree. Save you even for the river, let's say. But look,

01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:23.120
you have a heart out now. I don't want to pull you. This is really just getting into the good

01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:27.120
stuff. So let's just plan for another discussion. We haven't talked about this.

01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:34.640
No, I like this. I like this. I hope you see that I'm not some dullard about this. I'm trying to,

01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:42.160
I'm trying to, JP is very sweet about this. He sees me as trying to go as far as I can.

01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:48.720
By the way, thank you so much for introducing me to him and Paul did that too and your tutelage

01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:53.920
of him. I mean, it's, and I hope this doesn't sound condescending. It's meant as complimentary.

01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:58.960
It's really wonderful watching him flourish. It's really wonderful watching him flourish

01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:05.600
and thrive. I mean, JP is young. So it's like, I see the future as being extremely,

01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:09.920
there are so many possibilities ahead of him. So I'm excited to watch that too. So yeah.

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:17.120
Yeah. So let's make it a part one and a part two then. So let's pick it up around this because

01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:24.320
yeah, we're right on the cusp here because there is, I'll ask you to consider a possible

01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:31.920
tension between participation and independence. How we get those together because that's for

01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:37.280
me the nub of the issue. All right. I participate in my body and I don't think that John can be

01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:43.040
separable or independent from it. Right. And I get that I'm not reducible to the descriptions

01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:47.200
of the parts of my body. I concede all of that. And I think I've conceded that on all of the

01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:51.120
examples I've talked about. Yeah. Yeah. Let's definitely, I'd say I'll just

01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:56.880
write out say that's love, but we can talk about that and just open up that can and then

01:12:56.880 --> 01:13:02.080
finish the discussion. So, so thank you so much. That's a great thing to lay on the table.

01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:06.720
Thank you so much too. This is thanks and everybody also don't forget to check out

01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:10.560
our conversation with Jordan Peterson and Bishop Barron. It's bound to make some waves

01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:15.120
and so we're excited about that. And also looking forward to a conversation with Bishop Barron that

01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:19.600
I will have. I don't know exactly when it's going to happen. Also pretty much very soon. And I hope

01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:24.080
John that you also might have the chance to talk to him as well because I could see that he was

01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:28.720
like, Oh, who's this? There's something that he's saying that is just it was kind of popping up in

01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:34.080
his eye. So hopefully you can have a conversation with him as well. He was complimentary to me

01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:38.160
in the blog that I read. So I'll reach out to him and have a conversation with him very much like

01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:43.280
that. So thank you very much. All right. And so everybody, thank you. And we'll see you soon.

01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:45.200
Bye bye. Take care. Bye bye.
