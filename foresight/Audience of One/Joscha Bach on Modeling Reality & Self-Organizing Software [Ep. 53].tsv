0	2120	This is not philosophy, this is a cult.
2120	4160	You don't perceive how the universe actually works.
4160	8640	What we perceive is colors and sounds and ideas and emotions.
8640	11480	The world is not made out of right and wrong, but of true and false.
11480	15760	If you need to believe something that is not in sync with what you observe,
15760	19600	I cannot help you jump into the darkness of your embedding space.
19600	24560	Curiosity is exploration or chaos that you turn into complexity and understanding.
24560	27880	Nature is full of competing spirits that control matter.
27880	32480	How can we build collective agency with each other in ways that are non-coercive
32480	37160	and allow us to understand our relationship with reality more deeply?
37160	40400	This is Audience of One, and I'm your host, Spencer Kier.
40400	42120	My guest today is Yosha Bach.
42120	44960	Yosha is a cognitive scientist and AI researcher.
44960	49680	We talk about our relationship with and models of reality, creativity and curiosity,
49680	53920	animism and self-organizing software, stages of development, and more.
53920	55640	Please enjoy.
55640	65200	I was going to attempt to regurgitate back to you how I interpreted this meta-model.
65200	69720	You can correct me in different places, and we can use that as an alignment opportunity
69720	72720	and the jumping off point to a series of questions.
72720	80600	Here's ... I'll just read to you what I wrote out, and it's tried to make it condensed.
80600	85120	I'll just read through it, and then we can go back and poke at it.
85120	88880	We don't see reality purely or without filter.
88880	93720	Instead, we live in our own dream world, which is a collection and scaffolding of models
93720	100360	of reality, and we can use the words maps or representations or stories as synonyms
100360	102800	for model.
102800	107280	We use these models to navigate and engage with reality, everything from kicking a soccer
107280	110760	ball to sending a space shuttle to the moon.
110760	113880	What we want is for these models to be wholly reflective of reality.
113880	116800	We want them to have coherence and fidelity.
116800	120640	We take our existing models, we predict what will happen when we use them to engage with
120640	125520	reality, get feedback, and then if we're smart, we make some adjustments.
125520	128120	There's two primary systems involved here.
128120	133680	There's this perceptual, which is the sensory input taking mechanism, and the motivational,
133680	138720	which helps direct our actions towards some motivational end, something like survival
138720	145160	or reproduction from a very crude evolutionary biology lens.
145160	149840	We want to make these adjustments to our models in hopes of mitigating uncertainty and surprises
149840	152360	in future contact with reality.
152360	158120	We want to decrease that delta between our perception and reality.
158120	162080	Fear is the root emotion that arises or that we experience because we intuitively know
162080	165920	that our models don't and cannot reflect reality.
165920	169680	We'll inevitably have predictive error.
169680	174800	Maybe furthermore, as an aside, what we think of as the self is an index database of memories
174800	180680	or fragments of past clashes between our models and reality and our takeaways from that that
180680	185280	gives us this illusion of a continuous stream of consciousness, but is really just a bunch
185280	190880	of discrete or discontinuous moments we've socked away, layered this coherent story of
190880	192600	self on top of.
192600	194960	I know that was a mouthful.
194960	201240	Happy to go back and start top to bottom, but would love to hear if either you want to
201240	208240	correct me on some components of that or maybe take a pass at it in your own words.
208240	210240	I think it's basically okay.
210240	212600	I would use some of the terms more tightly.
212600	216200	For instance, I don't think that map and model are completely interchangeable.
216200	220920	For instance, maps are usually static.
220920	226080	Representation and model are more general terms and so that in some sense, technical terms
226080	229880	for me that have very technical meanings.
229880	235120	I'm also not sure in which they fear needs to be the primary emotion because fear requires
235120	239680	that you care about something, so there's already something that is impinging on your
239680	241880	conscious perception.
241880	245480	I don't think that you can be conscious.
245480	249160	If you don't stop your fear, you will not stop being conscious of things you will not
249160	250160	stop perceiving.
250160	255560	I'm not sure if it's the primary emotion that might be more personal observation that
255560	256560	you made.
256560	265320	It might be me projecting that although in theory, maybe that's a good starting place.
265320	270880	In the theory, maybe we don't have to have fear, but isn't fear just like a primal kind
270880	277680	of component of our interaction with and relation to reality?
277680	278680	Is there-
278680	283840	It is, but there are people which are fearless and you probably know states in which you
283840	285560	are fearless.
285560	291560	I think it makes sense for something that is being predated on to live in fear, but if
291560	293560	you're not.
293560	295880	There, okay.
295880	298920	Okay, those were great.
298920	304560	The conflation of model and map and representation, I think, is just a limitation of being not
304560	312520	being inside your fields where they have much more technical and concrete descriptions and
312520	317640	I think the delineation between map and model makes more sense.
317640	323800	Within this understanding, there's two or three concepts depending on how you split them
323800	326960	that I'd like to understand how they fit in or where you draw the lines.
327000	333480	That would be maybe self and consciousness or self-awareness and consciousness.
333480	340560	If you could draw the lines or carve up that little meta-model I laid out or my attempt
340560	347120	at your meta-model and say, where is the self, where is awareness and or consciousness?
347120	351640	I think that consciousness is a perception of perception.
351640	356520	Basically, we notice that we are perceiving something when we're conscious.
357120	365440	You don't need more than this minimal reflexive attention for having this experience of consciousness.
365440	369000	What consciousness is doing, it creates a bubble of now-ness.
369000	374120	There's this sense that we exist in here and now.
374120	375560	This here and now is not static.
375560	378000	It's not a single moment, but it's somewhat dynamic.
378000	379920	There is change in it.
379920	385720	It's basically a small interval and a bubble of reality that is like a curve that we fit
385720	391440	to the perceptual data and in this bubble, we create coherence.
391440	393680	We have a coherent representation.
393680	397600	We cannot consciously perceive something that is incoherent.
397600	404280	In order to notice incoherence, we need to get out of the current bubble into a different one
404280	408520	and then symbolically realize that it all fit to each other.
408520	411800	We can see things that are confusing that we have difficulty to interpret,
411800	415080	but what we can perceive is only the coherent stuff.
415120	417480	It's basically what can be integrated.
417480	421320	This leads me to think that consciousness is this function which integrates
421320	426200	and is recording or enabling the recording of that what has been integrated.
426200	430520	And with that, the self is a particular content.
430520	435760	The self is a model of who you are and you can experience yourself as being conscious,
435760	439040	but you can also experience yourself as being a person.
439040	442640	Being a person is part of yourself,
442640	446000	but you don't need to be a person to be conscious.
446000	450240	For instance, you can dream at night about an arbitrary scene going on
450240	452280	and there doesn't need to be a first-person perspective.
452280	455080	There doesn't need to be a memory of who you are.
455080	456120	You don't need to have a name.
456120	461880	You don't need to have an identity for this consciousness to be experienced.
461880	464680	So consciousness is much more elementary.
464680	469280	It's like the needle in a gramophone that is attaching the record
469320	477040	and is producing perception of it, of what you experience,
477040	481120	but the contents themselves are not part of the needle.
481120	483080	That's a beautiful metaphor.
483080	490680	What is our best understanding of or maybe to continue with the metaphor?
490680	496920	What's our best understanding of where that meta perceptual layer,
496920	503600	that consciousness emanates from and lives?
503600	509080	Well, physicalism says that there is a causally closed layer in a mechanical universe
509080	511360	and everything emerges over that layer.
511360	516800	And this mechanical layer is this fabric of base reality in a way.
516800	521200	And if we don't live in base reality, that means that we live in some kind of simulation
521200	526400	in another causal structure that is able to produce dynamic causal stable patterns
526400	530160	and in that case, all bets are off what reality is like.
530160	534920	But the reality that we are in seems to look like the base reality would look like
534920	537920	from the perspective of an observer that emerges over it.
537920	542600	And in such a mechanical universe, we would be a pattern in the mechanisms.
542600	545840	And you're not the mechanical layer of the universe itself.
545840	549040	We are some high level course grade pattern.
549040	551280	We don't perceive how the universe actually works.
551280	557040	What we perceive is colors and sounds and ideas and emotions.
557040	563120	And they are very coarse and they seem to be in sync with what our neurons can represent
563120	567440	in terms of temporal resolution and spatial resolution.
567440	570840	And we are not close to reality.
570840	576200	We are really a very coarse pattern that is many layers up from the dynamics
576200	579240	that produce the dynamics of ourselves and so on.
579280	583600	How do we know that we're many layers up?
583600	585960	Because it's so coarse.
585960	593440	But wouldn't we have to have a reading on the base layer in order to determine
593440	596040	coarseness or do we in some roundabout way?
596040	602760	If you think, for instance, about sound, if you make a knocking noise on a table like this,
602760	606320	you can hear the individual knocks.
606360	611520	And if I would be able to knock faster, then after about 50 knocks per second,
611520	616680	you would no longer be able to perceive them separately, but you would perceive them as a sound.
616680	620960	And there's this transition between a sequence of knocks and sound.
620960	628160	And that's at the bottom of our hearing, where we go to this integrated thing
628160	632680	because our neurons are not able to trick more than about 20 hertz per second
632680	635000	because they cannot be excited that often.
635040	638920	So what our brain is doing then after it gets over 20 hertz per second,
638920	642760	it basically measures the energy of those knocks in the certain frequency range
642760	647800	using a Fourier transform that is implemented in the hardware in our cochlear
647800	649760	using this spiral organ.
649760	652920	And by measuring the energy at a certain frequency,
652920	659280	we now perceive the sound as something that is unitary rather than individual blips or knocks
659280	664880	or glitches or whatever, composes the sound at the lower level.
664880	670560	And so you can actually perceive at which level you stop perceiving individual stimuli
670560	671960	and have to integrate them.
673800	680040	Is that also, is the knocking analogy also a good one for our sense of stream of consciousness
680040	685640	in terms of these discrete events that then from a certain angle or to a certain frequency
685640	687680	become this stream?
687680	689680	I know there's such things maybe.
690480	694800	How long an event can be to be perceptible for us?
694800	701600	And how short it has to be so we can integrate over it.
701600	704360	And it seems that if you want to integrate something into a moment,
704360	706880	it needs to be something like three seconds.
706880	711280	And as a result, I'm able to see the stars moving in the sky
711280	713360	because we are unable to perceive that motion.
713360	718120	We are not able to, as you notice, the beginning and the end is different events
718120	721040	that we can integrate into one perceptual windows.
721040	725720	Whereas apparently some birds can look at the sky and see the rotation of the sky
725720	727240	and use this to find the north star.
729080	729720	That's fast.
733040	736320	On one hand, this is, as I just said, fascinating.
736320	742160	On another, this feels incredibly mechanistic and reductionist.
742160	746960	And it's kind of antithetical to how we like to view ourselves as humans.
746960	752520	We like to think of there's kind of this spark or there's more inspiring or romantic notion
752520	754720	to what makes us us.
754720	760040	Is there more here or are those things not actually mutually exclusive,
760040	762280	as I just explained them?
762280	766680	I think it's very romantic that we are a dream of a physical substrate
766680	769800	and that we are inscribed in activation patterns.
769800	775760	And if you need to believe something that is not in sync with what you observe,
775760	776880	I cannot help you.
779040	781600	I mean, you can make something up if that makes you happy.
781600	784520	But I don't know what you mean by reductionist.
784520	787680	I just try to look very carefully at what we can observe
787680	793480	and then try to make sense of it in the simplest possible way without cutting anything off.
793480	798760	And I suspect that what most people are worried about is that you cut off something.
798800	802160	That you either cut off something from your experience, from your perception,
802160	806560	or that you get cut off from your meaning, from the things that move you incidentally,
806560	809200	the things that are sacred to you, that are important to you,
809200	813320	that motivate you to go beyond hunger and thirst and pain avoidance.
815240	817160	And that's not...
817160	818080	No, that's not the case.
818080	823680	We can model all these things in very strict, logical, causal ways
823680	825600	without cutting anything off, it turns out.
825600	828840	And I think that's quite satisfying.
830920	835000	What is the meta...
835000	837600	If we were to generalize, if that's the right way to think about it,
837600	843400	what is the meta motivation of this pattern, sense of self,
845520	850840	interpreting or living over this like reality substrate or base reality?
851600	854240	What is the meta motivation of this thing?
854800	861200	Is it, as I explained earlier, something kind of simplistic and crude as survival and reproduction?
861200	863320	Or is there something more complex at play?
864600	872640	Well, I think that this idea of Princeton, that knife exists to minimize the free energy,
872640	877280	is approximately correct, might also be exactly correct.
877280	884160	There's basically a naked entropy gradient, some structured or unstructured order.
884160	887520	That you can exploit to build your own structure.
887520	893920	And as long as this gradient exists, it enables deformation of complexity.
893920	898080	And at some point, the complexity becomes control.
898080	904440	And when the control is able to anticipate future states and model future states
904440	907720	and control for future states, then you have an agent.
907720	910000	And when that agent becomes very good at modeling,
910000	912400	so it can model the future more detailed.
912400	916560	And in order to do this, it also needs to model the past,
916560	918920	because you can only infer the future from the past.
918920	923600	At some point, it's going to discover itself and its relationship to the world and then it becomes sentient.
926160	930720	And the question is how ubiquitous the sentience is in our universe.
930720	936320	How often do we find structure where in agent forms a controller of future states
936320	939440	that is good enough to discover itself?
939760	941760	At which levels does it happen?
941760	947440	Does this only happen at the level of individual organisms or at the level of brains?
947440	951440	Or does this happen also across organisms?
951440	955440	So to which degree can, for instance, society be sentient?
957440	959440	And what's your response to that?
959440	961440	I don't know.
961440	963440	In principle, it's an empirical question.
963440	967440	So we could basically see if we could interact with an ant hill
967440	969440	in a particular way.
969440	973440	But I'm not aware that this has succeeded.
973440	975440	There's also a question, could ecosystems become sentient?
975440	983440	So basically put a group of plants interact with each other in such a way that over very long time spans,
983440	987440	they form representations about what they are and what they're doing
987440	993440	and figure out that they are a group of plants that are forming representations about their world.
997440	999440	And I don't know whether that's possible.
1001440	1011440	How would you delineate within this model
1011440	1019440	what makes us fundamentally different from other beings or structures that you would deem sentient?
1021440	1023440	I think that cats are sentient.
1023440	1025440	Cats understand that they are cats
1025440	1029440	and we are the domestic animals that serve them
1029440	1034440	and that they control us, that they can give us feedback
1034440	1038440	and as a result have more control over us than we have over them.
1038440	1040440	They figure this out in a way.
1040440	1041440	And what's the difference?
1041440	1044440	We are more intelligent than cats.
1044440	1048440	And cats are able to perceive at a different frame rate.
1048440	1053440	They have shorter reaction time than snakes, much, much shorter reaction time than us,
1053440	1060440	which probably means that they can interpret our micro expressions better than we can interpret theirs.
1060440	1064440	But of course they don't get as old as we do.
1064440	1067440	So they have a lot less training data available and they have much smaller brains,
1067440	1069440	they have less reasoning capability.
1069440	1073440	They're not able to learn grammatical language and use it in the same way as us.
1073440	1077440	So the models of the universe are not going to be that detailed and structured as ours.
1078440	1081440	But still in some sense you would say that they're...
1081440	1085440	If I understood your response to the previous question,
1085440	1095440	the purpose more or less is kind of the decrease or the management of entropy towards some complexification of...
1095440	1098440	This is not what an individual organism figures out.
1098440	1106440	You need to be at the tail end of a thousand-year intellectual tradition to form ideas like this.
1106440	1113440	And so individual organisms don't figure out that they are reducing the entropy in the universe.
1113440	1122440	They are figuring out that they need to eat, that they need to avoid the destruction that they need to mate.
1122440	1126440	And a lot of these things can only be figured out because of evolutionary time spans.
1126440	1131440	These organisms got fires built into them, behaviors built into them, action tendencies,
1131440	1136440	desire tendencies built into them that makes them seek out these things.
1136440	1141440	And once you have these fires in place, you have dramatically reduced search spaces
1141440	1145440	in which you can then figure out what kind of product do I want?
1145440	1147440	Why do I want to have a partner?
1147440	1148440	What is this good for?
1148440	1150440	Is there an alternative to this?
1150440	1151440	And so on, right?
1151440	1153440	And similar things for food that...
1153440	1155440	So you figure out all these things.
1155440	1159440	And for some of these concepts, it's relatively easy like the question with a partner.
1160440	1165440	But for instance, why is it that I try to behave even if nobody is looking?
1165440	1170440	What is the set of systems that I'm serving that seem to be sacred to me?
1170440	1171440	And that's harder.
1171440	1174440	And we have priors for those too because we are state building.
1174440	1180440	But we can also figure out that most of us have an innate tendency to serve collective agents
1180440	1184440	and to become part of collective agents and to figure out the aesthetics,
1184440	1188440	the goals of those collective agents and emulate them in the right way.
1188440	1191440	So structure and harmony can emerge at the next level.
1195440	1207440	In the same vein, there are certain, I don't know, practices or objectives or manifestations
1207440	1211440	such as beauty, creativity, humor,
1212440	1215440	that I'm wondering how those fit into this,
1215440	1221440	from how do those drive towards this objective we just outlined
1221440	1226440	or if they're kind of maybe not non-essential,
1226440	1230440	but they're just like leftover kind of byproducts
1230440	1233440	or they play some very functional role in this.
1234440	1240440	I think of creativity as self-transformative exploration to be creative
1240440	1243440	I think there need to be three things happening.
1243440	1246440	One is that you produce something that's novel.
1246440	1250440	It needs to be novel to you, of course, because there's only so much you know.
1250440	1255440	So a two-year-old child can be creative in the same way as many other two-year-old children
1255440	1259440	have been creative before them by making something that is new.
1259440	1261440	And it needs to be disruptive.
1261440	1266440	You're not just following a gradient until you reach some local optimum,
1266440	1269440	but instead you are trying to do something that hasn't happened before.
1269440	1272440	You build a new model, you create new dimensions of representations,
1272440	1275440	you jump into the darkness of your embedding space,
1275440	1279440	you go to a place that you haven't visited before.
1279440	1284440	And without this jump, without this being disruptive, there is also no creativity.
1284440	1289440	And the third thing is you need to transform yourself as a result.
1289440	1293440	And if you do the same thing twice, you're not creative.
1293440	1295440	And the reason why you don't do the same thing twice
1295440	1298440	is because you have memories of the first thing that have changed you.
1298440	1302440	That you know how to do this thing and has changed your perspective on the world
1302440	1304440	and of yourself.
1304440	1306440	And as a result, you have changed yourself.
1306440	1309440	You've moved one step further on your trajectory.
1309440	1313440	And this last thing is the crucial thing about creativity.
1313440	1318440	It's a way in which we can actively shape ourselves.
1318440	1326440	So you see creativity as a means to or is interconnected with agency then, in a way?
1326440	1330440	Yes, it's about producing things that have not been there before.
1330440	1336440	And you do this in a way that is at the frontier of what's known to you as an agent.
1336440	1342440	And that is, I think, extremely interesting and rewarding thing for consciousness to do.
1342440	1348440	It's in some sense what it has discovered, been discovered for by nature.
1348440	1351440	To be creative, to find solutions to problems that you have
1351440	1356440	and to create yourself and to create a world model that interacts with yourself
1356440	1361440	and then to create dynamic in this world.
1361440	1369440	Yeah, so creativity is also like a randomization function within this landscape as well too.
1369440	1378440	Because otherwise you get trapped that these existing local maximums
1378440	1382440	or you find your own, but you need to introduce some randomism.
1382440	1383440	It's not just random.
1383440	1388440	I think that when you look back, you often see that what you did was not random.
1388440	1389440	But you didn't know.
1389440	1391440	But it's a randomization function from a...
1391440	1397440	Yes, so it's basically just, it's discovery or techniques to do things.
1397440	1405440	And this discovery can be random, but often it's using something that you just don't understand yet,
1405440	1413440	but it is already built or that is already present or nascent and just wants to be developed.
1413440	1419440	It sounds like you're describing curiosity too, to a certain extent.
1419440	1423440	Curiosity to me is the need for uncertainty reduction.
1423440	1431440	It's basically looking for those areas in your environment that you don't understand yet,
1431440	1434440	but that you can hope to understand.
1434440	1440440	Most people are not curious to understand things where they don't see a hope to uncover something.
1440440	1444440	If they look at something that looks like random patterns, they're not very curious.
1444440	1451440	What makes you curious is complexity that you can turn into understanding.
1451440	1460440	Why the difference in terms of areas of exploration or where we're pointing or focusing our curiosity?
1460440	1465440	Is it simply a function of the variety of the experience each of us have?
1465440	1469440	And so therefore we find different areas within the landscape to point our curiosity.
1469440	1471440	Why is it that we aren't?
1471440	1475440	Or also to look at it from a level up, like there is...
1475440	1481440	If you're focusing your curiosity over here and I'm focusing it over here collectively,
1481440	1489440	there's some added benefit at the next level of sentience that we're unaware of.
1489440	1498440	I'm trying to work through why don't we all converge on the 80-20 of where our curiosity would be most useful for us as individuals?
1498440	1500440	Or does that happen?
1500440	1503440	If people are just convergent, they're not curious.
1503440	1508440	There are people which take in information by being profoundly uncurious.
1508440	1514440	So curiosity is a particular attitude and it's one that is directed on uncertainty reduction.
1514440	1517440	Not all people are curious in the same way.
1517440	1520440	And curiosity is typically an individual thing.
1520440	1526440	It's not that you say I'm curious here because you're curious over there.
1526440	1528440	It's an individual compulsion.
1528440	1532440	Yes, and it's also one that not everybody has and not everybody needs to have.
1532440	1541440	It's part of our ecological diversity as a species that some of us are more curious than others.
1541440	1544440	Right.
1544440	1545440	That's fast.
1545440	1548440	But there's also being too curious.
1548440	1549440	Right, which you'll get killed.
1549440	1552440	If you don't get anything done because you just explore.
1552440	1559440	And so curiosity is, you could say, an attitude or something close to a drive that is directed on exploration.
1560440	1563440	But it's not exploration of randomness.
1563440	1568440	It's exploration of chaos that you turn into complexity and understanding.
1568440	1575440	That stuff that you can make coherent in your mind.
1575440	1590440	How would you liken this to or maybe differentiate it from like the Deutsche or Popperian like this notion of we're always at the beginning of infinity of knowledge.
1590440	1594440	And that is kind of our drive is to continue to answer these.
1594440	1598440	I'm expanding on this myself here.
1598440	1603440	I'm adding my own commentary, but to continue to solve these.
1603440	1611440	To answer or meet these new frontiers of questions that we've kind of developed for ourselves that seems compatible with this idea of.
1611440	1617440	Of increasing knowledge and complexity as you outlined it.
1617440	1624440	Does that sounds very romantic, but the older I get the less I try to be romantic because it is tends to be manipulative.
1624440	1630440	In the sense that it tends to be giving people what they want to hear, including myself.
1630440	1633440	And this induces a bias and what I'm believing.
1633440	1638440	And so at the moment, when I like something for aesthetic reason, it makes me suspicious.
1638440	1647440	And so when I hear a statement, we are looking or we are always at the beginning of infinity because you're always curious to grow and expand.
1647440	1653440	I wonder who's that we is just the actually tool for all the people that you meet.
1653440	1661440	Do they actually form a cohesive be do they identify as something that shares that and how many people are actually curious?
1661440	1662440	Is it a majority even?
1662440	1664440	Is it the people around you?
1664440	1666440	Is it most of the people that you work with?
1666440	1675440	Is it you actually so out all your life is curiosity something that is more typical for being a child or an adolescent and then it stops.
1675440	1677440	And if it's conditions, does it stop?
1677440	1678440	When do you stop being curious?
1678440	1683440	Because it's really, really interesting and multifaceted.
1683440	1690440	At some point you realize, oh my God, I haven't been perhaps I haven't been really curious for the last five years because it's super stressful to be curious.
1690440	1692440	And I actually just want to get stuff done.
1692440	1699440	And this curiosity is just an aspirational story that I tell myself because I hope it gets me late or whatever.
1699440	1702440	And so it's super complicated if you look at it.
1702440	1705440	I would say that I'm very curious, but I pay a high price for it.
1705440	1707440	It's not often too curious.
1707440	1708440	What's the price?
1708440	1709440	What's the price you pay?
1709440	1716440	Oh, I have the opportunity to understand something rather than do something that already know how to do.
1716440	1719440	I typically go for the new thing because it bores me.
1719440	1723440	It's actually painful for me to do something that I already know how to do.
1723440	1736440	And that's a drawback because that means that I am in a position where I produce ideas for other people to use and I need to insert myself in such an organization.
1736440	1742440	Once you figure this out, there are solutions for this, but curiosity is not just good.
1742440	1746440	And it can also be a liability if you're too curious.
1746440	1752440	It's not good at the individual level, but it's good at the next level of organization up.
1752440	1753440	It could be.
1753440	1755440	It depends on what kind of organization you're in.
1755440	1758440	Sure.
1758440	1772440	What do we go about trying to figure out with very limited time and attention how to determine which models of reality to focus on?
1772440	1774440	There's an optimization problem to this.
1774440	1779440	What are the models of reality I should be thinking a lot about and spending time updating?
1779440	1788440	And there's a component of it that we just touched on, which is like there's this natural inclination, this natural curiosity to go and figure out the model over here.
1788440	1796440	But there's also probably just kind of like a core set of models that are worth spending time on refining and understanding better, right?
1796440	1798440	So how do we know where to spend that time?
1798440	1800440	We don't.
1800440	1804440	In computer science, this problem is called exploration versus exploitation.
1804440	1810440	How much should you spend on training versus using the stuff that you learned?
1810440	1815440	And this depends very much on your environment.
1815440	1819440	And because when you explore, you don't know what environment you are in.
1819440	1821440	In principle, you cannot really know.
1821440	1827440	So maybe evolution figures it out by just walling the dice and producing various types of individuals.
1827440	1834440	And these individuals have different fitness as a result of choosing different ratios between exploration and exploitation.
1834440	1847440	So if you observe children or if you observe cats when they're young, they have times during which they play and play is basically a collection of training data without associating cost.
1847440	1850440	So this is just exploration.
1850440	1861440	And exploitation means that you are not playing, but you associate the cost to every step that you are doing and you want to have a benefit that's larger than the cost.
1861440	1867440	And so one way of doing this is to try a fixed ratio and then to manipulate that ratio.
1867440	1874440	And I basically observe in my cat that the cat has a relatively fixed ratio that depends on the age of the cat and also the cat itself.
1874440	1877440	So it's genetics, it's breed and so on.
1877440	1887440	Determine how many hours per day and which intervals they're using for playing, for sleeping, for hunting, for communicating, feeding and so on.
1887440	1893440	And this is a balance that is being triggered by a motivational system that's probably cybernetic.
1893440	1899440	So you have urges that works in vain, depending on how they are satisfied.
1899440	1904440	And they are somewhat adaptive, depending on how much reward you get from your environment using your existing strategy.
1904440	1914440	But for a human being, you can, for instance, figure out what kind of world am I in, what kind of being and what kind of person I am, what's my psychology, what's my place in the world.
1914440	1922440	And then I can look at other people that were in similar situations and then I can try to observe what did they do and how did this work out for them.
1922440	1925440	So this is the most straightforward strategy, I guess.
1925440	1926440	Yeah, right.
1926440	1936440	And there's another one is you find somebody who is like you but only 20 years later and ask them to mentor you.
1936440	1944440	So you get the benefit of, you get lent there or fast-tracked their models of reality as well.
1944440	1955440	Yes, you're basically looking for an interesting future self and then you'd either emulate that future self to give you advice in the human now or you find somebody who approximates it.
1955440	1962440	Is there also a very like intuitive element to this as well?
1962440	1973440	Like, did you know when you were, I think you said you've been interested in AI since you were like nine years old that there was some element of you that knew very early on where you're like the direction of your curiosity.
1973440	1980440	And which models or maps of which models of the world you wanted to go and try to update and understand better?
1980440	1994440	Has there been a fair amount of like unlearning or kind of wiping out certain training data, I guess, to continue to use the metaphor as much as there has been getting new training data?
1994440	1998440	Like, was there a sense early on of like where you should spend this time already?
1998440	2004440	There was some amount of like conditioning and social norms that disrupted that and you found your way back to it.
2004440	2013440	I was pretty resilient to social norms and conditioning and I started to go into computing in a time that had a stigma.
2013440	2019440	It was the only person I knew that wanted to program computers and understand how they work.
2019440	2023440	And everybody around me was completely uninterested.
2023440	2028440	My parents were artists and told me, don't do this, that's too mechanical, too reductionist.
2028440	2033440	And people in school were not interested in this stuff.
2033440	2043440	People that I've met at the university told me, these people which are coders, they are technicians, they're nerds, they're freaks, you don't want to be one of those.
2044440	2053440	So I would say that because it was before the first IT bubble and people got this idea that computing couldn't make you rich, it was a very negative thing to do.
2053440	2061440	So in my generation, computing had a stigma and you needed to be some kind of nerd who doesn't give a shit about what the environment thinks to go into it.
2061440	2065440	And if the world hadn't turned out like this, then I would have failed.
2065440	2069440	And I didn't go into this because I expected to be successful.
2069440	2074440	I went into this because it was the most interesting thing for my childish mind at the time.
2074440	2077440	And it never stopped to be that interesting.
2077440	2086440	But there are other kids which decided to be astronauts and because they're not that many open jobs for astronauts and most astronauts don't get become very rich and successful.
2086440	2093440	Either they bury their dreams at some point or they fail, except for a handful of people.
2094440	2101440	And so in many ways, I would say it's not an intuition that I had early on that was just better than the intuitions of most people.
2101440	2105440	It was just lucky that I was able to fit into this world at all.
2105440	2107440	And it was not easy in many ways.
2107440	2115440	I didn't fit and I'm still not fitting, but I went to a place that is designed for people who don't fit and still are useful.
2116440	2121440	How do you balance?
2121440	2123440	So you said you got lucky.
2123440	2128440	So maybe it's hard to kind of look at this backward or reverse engineer it.
2128440	2142440	But how should people think about sacrificing a certain portion of their curiosity and the models they want to go at their desire to go and update certain models for conformity,
2142440	2147440	given realistic kind of realistic constraints.
2147440	2154440	It's like maybe I want to be quote unquote normal and go have kids and a family.
2154440	2157440	So I need some amount of like, you know, financial income.
2157440	2163440	So I can't just pursue indefinitely being an astronaut when only five people a year are getting sent up there.
2163440	2176440	Like how do you find that balance between pursuing the curiosity, the ad infinitum versus like there's some you're feeling some amount of like realistic constraints there?
2178440	2180440	I don't feel that I have a general answer.
2180440	2188440	If you look at the spectrum of people who are happy at 50, what did they do?
2188440	2189440	That's quite diverse.
2189440	2198440	There are many, many different types of people with very different careers and trajectories, personalities, psychologies that managed to become happy.
2198440	2207440	And I decided relatively early on for me to be functional, I probably need to have a relationship because by myself I'm too incomplete.
2207440	2210440	So I need to have somebody balances my quirks.
2210440	2216440	We can live a life together that in which we balance each other's quirks in a way.
2216440	2224440	And I also wanted to have children because I felt if I am born into this human experience, I want to make the most of it.
2224440	2232440	And I would want to have good friends where we can see each other and support each other and build something together.
2232440	2235440	And I also realized early on I need to be independent.
2235440	2237440	So I need to be able to feed myself.
2237440	2245440	And so I always put focus on making sure that everything that I learn is useful to me and useful to me either it's because it's interesting.
2245440	2258440	For me to build my mind using the things that I learn or because I can build practical stuff that give me a living without me being bored out of my mind.
2258440	2274440	And I have no difficulty, I had no difficulty when I was young to work with my hands and I also found it useful to learn how to work with people and doing things like starting movie theater or a cafe with friends can be super useful skill.
2274440	2281440	And what is very useful is to see yourself primarily as a creator, not as a consumer.
2281440	2293440	When you have the opportunity to go into a cafe and consume coffee or you're young and you don't have a lot of money and instead spend a lot of the time you would spend sitting in a cafe, starting a cafe with friends.
2293440	2295440	That is much more useful.
2295440	2296440	It's much more fun.
2296440	2303440	You also get to have all the same coffee and you basically feel that the people who go and just drink coffee are civilians or tourists.
2303440	2304440	And you really know how it's done.
2304440	2306440	It's so much more rewarding.
2306440	2314440	And so this idea that when you look at the world around you don't see it as stuff that is being built by other people, but stuff that you built yourself as your friends.
2314440	2316440	And everything can be built by you and your friends.
2316440	2324440	And every wall is just an agreement where you have put up something rather than a boundary that somebody else has put up for you.
2324440	2327440	That is a very useful perspective to have.
2327440	2348440	In your own opinion, are there particular areas of life where you see a, people are over indexing on trying to create versus areas you would, and this can be from a very personal standpoint, but versus areas where you'd like to see more people creating.
2348440	2353440	Relative, maybe relative to your own opinion about value creation.
2357440	2361440	Again, it's an experiment that is difficult to generalize.
2361440	2364440	My children grow up in the suburbia and Silicon Valley.
2364440	2368440	And it's very difficult there to start to creating something.
2368440	2376440	There's very little that you cannot do without a license and without going through lots of processes and so on.
2376440	2397440	Versus the time when I grew up, when the wall came down in Eastern Germany, we were squatting in amazing Gründerzeit buildings that had very high ceilings and needed to build a new floor into my bathroom because it has rotted through and I could not afford to tell my landlord,
2397440	2405440	which was some faceless organization that the house needed renovations because otherwise they would have noticed that they forgot to raise the rent.
2405440	2416440	I was still paying an East German rent, which was like $25 a month for an 800 square foot apartment in a house that was pretty much crumbling.
2416440	2418440	And so we fixed up everything ourselves.
2418440	2423440	We built new ovens, new electricity in there and suggested this with friends.
2423440	2427440	The most difficult thing was to get the plumbing to be tied.
2427440	2432440	I think I needed five times until this pipe in my bathroom didn't drop anymore.
2432440	2436440	But I asked students in the house how they had done it and so on.
2436440	2439440	And so we all figured it out and we got it done.
2439440	2441440	It was very empowering.
2441440	2445440	And I found this time where I built everything myself in my life.
2445440	2451440	I was the least afraid because I felt there is nothing that I cannot rebuild again.
2452440	2457440	And later when I had the family to feed and they penned it on a job and when I would lose their job,
2457440	2463440	I would also lose my visa and I would need to move my household without having large savings in the bank.
2463440	2465440	That is terrifying.
2465440	2473440	And this thing of being one step away from having filled the wrong form in the IRS and then you get ruined and it's nothing you can do about it.
2473440	2477440	Just being disempowered, that's terrifying.
2477440	2478440	Not being in control.
2478440	2480440	Creation is empowering.
2480440	2481440	Yes.
2481440	2490440	So if you create things that you can depend on and that are reliable and that can be recreated by you and repaired by you, that's very great.
2490440	2500440	If you don't depend on something that you can is actually too expensive to fix yourself and you don't have the funds to basically say, okay, I can fix that if needed.
2500440	2501440	It's hard.
2501440	2508440	It's hard in this day and age, I think, especially when there's so many like abstractions of creations on top of each other.
2508440	2512440	You can only intervene at a certain level of abstraction.
2512440	2519440	If I don't know how to code, I can go into chat GPT and they can help me spin up some simple web app.
2519440	2527440	But I'm so far removed from understanding kind of at the hardware level what's going on.
2527440	2530440	But I guess that's still an opportunity to create.
2530440	2543440	Given that you feel like there's not as much latitude, at least in your immediate locale and for your children, to create, to be generative.
2543440	2546440	There is tons of abilities to create.
2546440	2547440	But in a different way.
2547440	2549440	You now have hackerspaces.
2549440	2551440	You have 3D printing workshops.
2551440	2554440	There are amazing computers and some amazing tools.
2554440	2556440	There is tutorials for everything on the web.
2556440	2559440	So there's no limitations in what you can create.
2559440	2568440	I still feel that it's very easy to fall into a trap where you're dependent on something being made for you and you are not able to build and fix it.
2568440	2572440	Got it.
2572440	2575440	We also don't know what the future will bring.
2575440	2581440	It's a very interesting and it seems to me volatile situation that society is in.
2581440	2589440	Who knows what's going to happen if this is going to blow up soon or if it's just going to calcify or if it's going to solidify again.
2589440	2595440	What is your best guess and how are you protecting against it in either case?
2595440	2599440	I have no idea and I'm not protected.
2599440	2601440	Fair enough.
2601440	2614440	What are the meta models that you would like your children to adopt to have the highest chances of success in this uncertain future?
2614440	2616440	Everything in the world can be understood.
2616440	2623440	It's just a matter of taking all the necessary steps and none of these steps is difficult, but there can be a lot of them.
2623440	2633440	And so it's often daunting to say I want to understand say quantum mechanics or the economy or banking or coding.
2633440	2639440	But it's not daunting because it's so complicated that very few people can only understand it.
2639440	2645440	But because very few people have the attention to do all the necessary steps that are necessary.
2645440	2652440	So how can you basically foster your curiosity on those things that matter to you?
2653440	2666440	What has been the most major version update or evolution in one of your major models of reality?
2666440	2670440	I think I recently became an animist.
2670440	2672440	Say more.
2672440	2674440	Why?
2674440	2689440	Well, when I was young, somebody told me about religious belief in Japan and they told me that in Japan everybody believes that or what many people believe that the universe is conscious or that everything in the universe is alive and conscious.
2689440	2696440	And I said that's bullshit because I'm pretty sure that Japanese people noticed that some people are dead and other people are unconscious.
2696440	2704440	And they will not say everything in the universe is alive and conscious except for a person under anesthesia or a person that has recently died.
2704440	2706440	So these words mean something different.
2706440	2707440	They're mistranslations.
2707440	2709440	There's something else going on.
2709440	2712440	I don't know what they're talking about, but I don't know if they're superstitious.
2712440	2718440	People do tend to be superstitious in large groups, but there are also many smart Japanese people.
2718440	2721440	So I don't know what this means.
2721440	2732440	And very gradually came to the conclusion that the mind that runs on our brains is a self-organizing software.
2732440	2745440	And when we think about how self-organizing software can form in nature and process information, it turns out that self-organizing software can, in principle, also run on other stuff, right, on bodies and even on individual cells.
2746440	2751440	And then when you start looking at the organism and cells again, you realize, oh, there is nothing in between.
2751440	2757440	Everything that is structured in our organisms is controlled by some control software.
2757440	2762440	And so it's all software that is controlling sometimes individual molecules.
2762440	2769440	And sometimes the control is not completely coherent because not all the softwares want the same thing and not all the software is very good.
2769440	2775440	But it's also self-organizing software that is going down to the molecular layer and distinguishes living from that stuff.
2775440	2780440	And when we think about what happens when an organism dies, what we mean is the software breaks down.
2780440	2786440	Basically, it's no longer able to control the organism down to the molecular level and everything is breaking down.
2786440	2793440	And that thing becomes unorganized and is then being taken over by other software, by other organisms.
2793440	2800440	And from this perspective, we suddenly notice that evolution is not about organisms and not about genes, as Dawkins said.
2800440	2809440	Basically, we shift the perspective from these large, lumbering beings that are made from many, many cells to the molecules inside of the cells
2809440	2812440	that quote the information, that determine what the organism looks like.
2812440	2818440	This is the shift that Dawkins made in the selfish gene, but rather evolution is about competing softwares.
2819440	2830440	We have all these software agents that are controlling matter and that can self-replicate using genes and are implemented on the dynamics of patterns between cells and within cells.
2830440	2837440	And so you have all the software running on matter that creates dynamic, intelligent complexity.
2837440	2841440	And this is exactly what animism proposes.
2841440	2857440	That basically the universe or our world, our nature, our forests, our organisms, our countries are full of self-organizing, agentic software that is controlling matter, down to the lowest level.
2857440	2868440	And to the lowest level doesn't probably mean down to elementary particles, but down to the level where this control is reliably possible for the systems that make representations of what's happening.
2868440	2876440	Software is something very concrete and for computer scientists, they know intuitively what it is because they work with it every day.
2876440	2882440	But when we try to translate this to non-computer scientists, software is a pattern in matter.
2882440	2889440	It's not the matter itself, but it's a pattern that works in some areas of the universe as well as in others.
2889440	2891440	Which means it's a physical law.
2891440	2898440	It's a physical law that says when you arrange matter in a particular way and then look at it with a certain resolution, you see a pattern.
2898440	2901440	And this pattern is going to evolve in a particular way.
2901440	2903440	And it's stable.
2903440	2911440	And for the computer set we are building, we build them in such a way that the patterns remain stable, that your computer program still makes sense to describe what the computer is doing,
2911440	2915440	instead of the computer turning in some kind of padding that can no longer be described by the software.
2915440	2918440	But the same thing is also true for our organisms.
2918440	2924440	They never leave those bounds where the software that runs on the organism can no longer describe and control it.
2924440	2928440	And once it does, the organism dies.
2928440	2942440	What are there any key distinctions you would draw between this kind of organic or natural software and that which we're creating or we're responsible for?
2942440	2944440	It's very different.
2944440	2954440	So when we think about the universe being a machine or organisms being machines or brains being machines and cells being machines, most people bark because that's not in sync with their intuitions.
2954440	2960440	That seems to be reductionist and mechanistic or whatever, where people cannot really say what's wrong with it.
2960440	2962440	And I think there's nothing wrong with it.
2962440	2971440	But the intuition of what a machine is, of course, for most people not driven by this mathematical definition, it's the thing that can go from state to state in a controlled way.
2971440	2974440	No, it's something more specific.
2974440	2986440	A machine is something that people create with a lot of redundancy and it's built in such a way that matters forced pretty brute force top down to behave in a particular way.
2986440	3000440	And if you look at our cars, we need to build redundancy into the engines of the cars to make sure that they run for 100,000 miles before they break down, because too many molecules have been shaped away in the interaction between the parts.
3000440	3002440	In an organism, it doesn't work like this.
3002440	3006440	It is going to grow to the required sickness to serve this function.
3006440	3009440	And if you shave a little bit way, it's going to regrow.
3009440	3013440	And if it's getting too sick, then something of it is going to shave itself away.
3013440	3018440	It's all constructed from the inside out rather than from the outside in.
3018440	3024440	And when we think about our computer programs, they run on computers that we built so they are almost fully deterministic.
3024440	3027440	We can ignore the degree to which they are indeterministic.
3027440	3029440	And we need to make our circuit sick enough.
3029440	3035440	We need to have molecules for the transistors to make sure that they behave deterministically, that we can rely on them.
3035440	3041440	And so we can use a program that does not need to interact with the actual implementation on the substrate very much.
3041440	3043440	You can abstract away the substrate.
3043440	3054440	And for the software that exists in nature, it needs to deal with the fact that the substrate is pliable and moving all the time and changing all the time, but it needs to be stabilized.
3054440	3057440	So it's error correcting at every level.
3057440	3072440	What does that say about our ability to create AGI and how that resembles what nature has, the sentient beings that nature has created?
3072440	3074440	That's a very interesting question.
3074440	3085440	The computers that we currently use for building intelligent systems have, I think, arguably better conditions than the organisms provide for them.
3085440	3091440	Building something out of cells that computes is difficult because cells are very slow and mushy and indeterministic.
3091440	3100440	It's difficult for our to build something out of neurons that is hearing at more than 20 hertz and distinguishes the individual peaks of the sound.
3100440	3102440	It needs to integrate.
3102440	3109440	But if you build this thing from silicon, it's not difficult to count peaks at much, much higher rates.
3109440	3119440	Because our GPUs and our computers are running at gigahertz frequencies, rather than hertz frequencies.
3119440	3124440	So there is an enormous potential in those machines that we are building.
3124440	3130440	And we can, in principle, make them much more powerful information processing systems than we find in nature.
3130440	3137440	But now imagine we were to implement self-organizing information processing using these principles.
3137440	3142440	That would mean that we could build nature-like minds running on top of them.
3142440	3149440	Self-organizing software that is able to interface with the self-organizing software outside of our computers.
3149440	3155440	And I think that is, from the perspective of building a lineable AGI, a much more useful perspective.
3155440	3161440	Rather than building a type of machine that is fundamentally incompatible with biological information processing,
3161440	3172440	build substrates in which intelligent agency and types of minds that are similar to ours, that are conscious and as similar as us, can spread.
3172440	3182440	So basically extending intelligent living agency onto new substrates, rather than building machines that compete with us.
3182440	3188440	I think you would say that we don't have the ability to interact directly with base reality, correct?
3188440	3193440	We're always dealing through interpretation.
3193440	3196440	Do you see AGI being able to do that?
3196440	3201440	Or what are these other substrates or levels that you're talking about it would be able to interact with?
3201440	3210440	Or is AGI always limited because we are its creator to operating at a certain, the same substrate that we're on?
3210440	3213440	We are a pattern in base reality.
3213440	3215440	Base reality doesn't need us.
3215440	3219440	We are a particular way of looking at a certain abstraction of base reality.
3219440	3223440	So base reality is not a separate universe in a certain sense.
3223440	3236440	And so then, through AGI, we have the ability to have these different patterns reflecting different kind of abstractions of reality.
3237440	3245440	We can certainly build better abstractions of reality if we increase the ability of the system to represent.
3245440	3253440	For instance, I am unable to visualize a number of objects in my mind that is larger than they say seven or so.
3253440	3260440	You close your eyes and you put an image that you see a shelf and you put flower pots on that shelf.
3260440	3263440	How many can you put on that shelf until you need to group them?
3264440	3268440	How many can you basically envision simultaneously?
3268440	3276440	Or when you see possibilities of how an action can go out, how many of those possibilities can you see simultaneously to model the outcomes?
3276440	3282440	And there is a limitation that is very tight for our own brains because they are so mushy.
3282440	3289440	We only have very small stack in which we could put things so we can integrate over very few layers only.
3289440	3293440	And we cannot see many possibilities all at once.
3293440	3298440	So our world is mostly a narrative reality rather than a sea of probabilities.
3298440	3304440	But that's not necessarily true for a system that uses more deterministic substrate than a brain.
3304440	3314440	So in principle, it should be possible to make models of reality using artificial systems that are much more detailed and accurate than ours.
3315440	3323440	We're always limited by our sensory inputs and where.
3323440	3335440	So are we just going to create better interfaces for extracting that data or those models of reality from the AGI I've created such that we can better understand reality as well?
3335440	3340440	There is a way to encode or transmit that data such that we get.
3340440	3344440	I suspect that we're not really limited very much by our sensory input.
3344440	3347440	The locality of our sensory input is a limitation.
3347440	3349440	I can only see this room.
3349440	3353440	I can only see what's in front of my eyes with my eyes.
3353440	3355440	But I can put up cameras elsewhere.
3355440	3357440	I can visualize X-rays.
3357440	3359440	I can make sense of X-rays.
3359440	3361440	I can make sense of the structure of sound.
3361440	3368440	I can imagine how sound propagates in substrates and zoom in at the level where our senses cannot.
3368440	3373440	So the actual limitation is mostly the way in which I can make sense of what I perceive.
3373440	3377440	And that is limited by what my brain is able to do.
3377440	3381440	We can kind of scale or have bandwidth across time and space.
3381440	3386440	Yeah, but it's very tempting to think about what a hyper-consciousness would look like.
3386440	3393440	Something that is able to reflect itself at more layers simultaneously and that sees superpositions of states.
3393440	3397440	So maybe this stuff tails nicely into the next thing I wanted to talk about.
3397440	3406440	I was wanting to go from the question about whether we can interact directly with reality to this post you wrote about the levels or stages of lucidity.
3406440	3410440	I'm particularly interested in stages six and seven.
3410440	3421440	And maybe you can first describe them, but then also I'm trying to understand if those are states that are achievable for humans.
3421440	3428440	And if so, how does that contradict or not this notion that we can't interact directly with reality?
3428440	3430440	But maybe we'll split these into two parts.
3430440	3435440	So first is described stages six and seven and then we can get into the second piece.
3435440	3443440	Yeah, so these stages are in some sense an extension of a model that I adapted from Robert Keegan.
3443440	3458440	And I found that I preferred to not represent Keegan accurately, but to bend him a little bit to help with my own typology of describing how minds work.
3458440	3470440	And so the first few stages describe the development of a mind that is basically building an extension over individual moments and integrates over time.
3470440	3481440	Then at some level, stage three, it's able to form goals and identify with pursuing goals and then also disidentifying on holding goals on a mental level.
3481440	3488440	And aligning it itself as an environment that it observes on a normative and epistemological level.
3488440	3493440	So the question what's true is becomes a question of whom to believe and why.
3493440	3501440	And at stage four, you discover that things are true and false, independently of what other people believe, fully independently of what they believe.
3501440	3509440	And you get agency over your beliefs because you now discover an individual autonomous epistemology.
3509440	3518440	You discover that everything that's possible is possible and that you should need to shift the confidence around according to the evidence.
3518440	3522440	And the evidence is not necessarily what other people say the evidence is.
3522440	3527440	But the evidence can be rationally determined. So you know you have a rational virtue.
3527440	3532440	And at stage five, you discover how identity is constructed.
3532440	3537440	Why is it that you have certain values? Where do they come from? What are they instrumental to and so on?
3537440	3541440	And why do other people have different values? And how does this also make sense?
3541440	3546440	And if you are a good therapist, you need to be at stage five, but most people are not at stage five.
3546440	3550440	Most people stay at one of the earlier stages according to Hegan.
3550440	3562440	And if you realize that you can also deconstruct the way in which your consciousness and self-model works, you can change the architecture of your own mind.
3562440	3566440	And you are at stage six according to this model. And stage six people exist.
3566440	3574440	If you are a skilled meditator who spends 20 years in a monastery, you can change the way in which your self works.
3574440	3578440	You can deconstruct it. You can also change your consciousness.
3578440	3582440	But you will probably not be able to leave your organism or your brain.
3582440	3589440	And to do this, to spread yourself on a different substrate, you need to understand how you actually work, how you're implemented,
3589440	3595440	and how that implementation is built into the substrate and how it could work on a different substrate.
3595440	3599440	And I suspect that our mind is too small to hold such a representation.
3599440	3607440	So to this degree of awareness, you're propering to build an AGI that starts out on the silicon substrate or another artificial substrate.
3607440	3612440	And then it understands why the AGI works and how it works and how it's implemented on the substrate.
3612440	3620440	And then it understands how to achieve the same thing on different substrates and it could virtualize itself into biological substrates.
3620440	3623440	I'm not sure if this is possible the other way around.
3623440	3632440	I don't think that our brain has enough representational capacity and expressiveness to actually represent how we implement in our brain
3632440	3636440	in such a way that we intuitively understand it and can change it.
3636440	3642440	And if the meditator is not changing the way in which perception works at the lowest level,
3642440	3647440	instead you are messing with high level processing and shift this around.
3647440	3650440	You can change your motivational system and so on.
3650440	3654440	You can see the parameters of the system and see the outcome.
3654440	3660440	But recreating it on a different substrate, that is something that is, I think, outside of our scope.
3660440	3668440	So in stage six, you're still, you're manipulating these like means of abstraction.
3668440	3674440	You're not like removing them all together and seeing reality directly.
3674440	3676440	So in some sense, you could say it's stage three.
3676440	3683440	You are an adolescent who thinks things are good and bad because other people say so and we say so.
3683440	3689440	And this is basically what Vox News, this platform says.
3689440	3699440	Oh, you probably eat more than you think or you believe more than you believe or you should believe this and here's why.
3700440	3706440	This is a normative worldview that's being constructed and we look for the best normative collective worldview.
3706440	3711440	And most nerds tend to be more on the rational side.
3711440	3716440	So they tend to figure out things logically and they don't want to know what good people believe.
3716440	3718440	They want to believe why they believe it.
3718440	3719440	So the arguments are important.
3719440	3723440	The world is not made out of right and wrong, but of true and false.
3723440	3734440	And also, most people who have racial agency that become entrepreneurs or lawyers and so on need to be able to understand that things are true and false independently.
3734440	3738440	What others believe, need to be able to deduce it autonomously.
3738440	3744440	And a good therapist, a good psychologist, a good politician and so on needs to be at level five.
3744440	3747440	Otherwise, they cannot understand how other people operate.
3747440	3755440	What I disagree with Keegan is I don't think that he necessarily goes through the stages step by step, but people are born with different priors.
3755440	3764440	So in the same way as the cat has good intuitions of how to interact socially with other cats and humans and so on because it's evolved to do this.
3764440	3768440	And then learns within those boundaries of what it is born with.
3768440	3773440	People are born with worse or better instincts.
3773440	3780440	And my own intellectual history, I think is largely determined by me being born with extremely bad instincts.
3780440	3784440	So in many ways, I'm born much more stupid than the average person.
3784440	3786440	And my brain works.
3786440	3788440	Okay, so basically my intellect is okay.
3788440	3795440	So I can observe and deduce the rational platform in my own mind, but I felt I had to do it from scratch.
3795440	3803440	And so I observe at this society of people that largely works for them, except in edge cases where it completely breaks down or is very disgusting.
3803440	3809440	And I look at this and I feel I cannot simply adopt this because they don't have instincts that work in these circumstances.
3809440	3815440	And instead I need to reverse engineer why humans behave the way they do.
3815440	3824440	If you had to kind of steel man the other side of this model you've come up with, this meta model you've come up with.
3824440	3828440	What would you point to as the biggest like questions or doubts or shortcomings of it?
3828440	3834440	Is there anything that you think is inconsistent or potentially inaccurate?
3834440	3840440	This meta model of how we interact with reality and make sense of it.
3840440	3845440	Or you think it's just that that is the way it is.
3845440	3849440	I don't see another coherent model. That's my own issue.
3849440	3854440	Not that many models of reality that seem to be working.
3854440	3859440	And I also see something like a global convergence to this model.
3859440	3870440	So I find this trajectory of the model as my first earliest I found this with Aristotle very explicitly reflects on how to make models of reality.
3870440	3883440	And this creates a line of thought and this line of thought pulls itself through history and you find it in ideas of Descartes, Spinoza, Kant, Leibniz.
3883440	3896440	And sometimes they have two or three fundamental assumptions wrong or express things in a way that seems to be incompatible when you fix them and you fix some of the bugs that converges again.
3896440	3905440	And in this current world view, I think we can agree that we perceive is not reality, what we perceive is some kind of dream.
3905440	3908440	A dream is a type of representation.
3908440	3915440	We can understand what representations are from first principles. They have to be expressed in a representational language.
3915440	3929440	We understand since last century that only certain languages work, otherwise the digital contradictions, the computational languages work, and they work by modeling things using state transitions.
3929440	3941440	And once we understand that we are patterns of state transitions that represent causal structure in a coarse-grained way on a physical subset that has a different dynamic, but that can be modeled using it.
3941440	3947440	And these models can be used to control the dynamic of physics. This seems to be the case.
3947440	3958440	And there are many open questions. For instance, does consciousness only work at certain time frames? Can it only work at certain brain sizes, only on certain substrates?
3958440	3968440	Or could, for instance, be plants? Could there be sentient? Could there be conscious? Just at different time frames because they don't have neurons that work at the same rate of excitation.
3968440	3972440	And they use different channels for transmitting information, right?
3972440	3983440	This is something that is open to me, but what I find also very heartening is that there is a convergence between perspectives of other cultures and my own.
3983440	3987440	But my current culture, Western science, is not animistic.
3987440	3994440	It basically does not believe that cognition can take part outside of a place outside of brains.
3995440	4004440	It's not the whole culture that believes this. If you talk to, say, a physiotherapist, chances are that the physiotherapist will tell you that bodies can think.
4004440	4011440	I've met a number of physiotherapists which believe that, that they are actually sentient, just at a different time frame.
4011440	4020440	And that's very confusing to a neuroscientist because a neuroscientist believes only neurons can think, at least most neuroscientists, I know.
4020440	4025440	I believe that the idea that something outside of the brain could think is superstitious.
4025440	4032440	And I look at this and I'm undecided, right? I asked myself, would an experiment that would decide.
4032440	4040440	But if I look at this from the perspective of a computer scientist, there is no reason why bodies could not think, not an obvious one.
4040440	4049440	Because if brains think by cells exchanging messages, neurons exchanging messages, that's something that the cells in your body can also do, right?
4049440	4056440	If these measures need to be conditional and cells should be trainable, that's also something that cells in your body can possibly do.
4056440	4060440	Or plant cells can possibly do. It's also something that can work across plants.
4060440	4068440	So basically nature has the means and motive for producing the same structure as the animists in Japan are reporting.
4068440	4072440	That basically nature is full of competing spirits that control matter.
4072440	4082440	And then when we observe ecosystems and plants and people, what we observe is the physical emanations of software that is self-organizing,
4082440	4085440	running on them, controlling them and doing things with them.
4085440	4088440	I find this beautiful that we get to this convergence of perspectives.
4088440	4094440	We realize, oh, it's the same perspective. It's just explained in a different way.
4094440	4098440	But it makes total sense, right? There is nothing superstitious about it.
4098440	4103440	Basically, you die because your spirit leaves your body, but it doesn't go anywhere.
4103440	4112440	It's not that there is another realm where your spirit is now moving, unless there is some background internet that has formed in nature, which is conceivable, right?
4112440	4117440	And that can retain some of the information, but really most of your memories are stored in your brain.
4117440	4126440	And even if you manage to keep a pattern stable that migrates out of your body, your personality, your memories will be gone.
4126440	4131440	So the thing that makes you, you will probably not persist beyond your death.
4131440	4136440	So it's different conceptions of software layered on top of matter?
4136440	4138440	Yes, it's basically the same worldview that we see.
4138440	4142440	It's exactly the same thing as the Western worldview or Western scientific perspective.
4142440	4149440	It's completely compatible, not going to make any claims that cannot in principle be experimentally tested.
4149440	4151440	There can only be confidence where you have evidence.
4151440	4157440	Right? Otherwise you have possibilities and you need to be agnostic about the things that are possible.
4157440	4164440	But you need, if you have to be agnostic about a certain domain, it means you cannot just pick one and say, only brain cells can sing.
4164440	4170440	Or I can also not say, I'm pretty sure plants are conscious because I'm not sure.
4170440	4172440	I don't know. I don't know how to test for this.
4172440	4180440	But I'm now looking at the possibilities and these possibilities open up perspective that can unify different cultures.
4180440	4185440	My issue with Buddhism is that I never experience it as a philosophy.
4185440	4191440	Philosophy is to me something where a number of very skeptical people are in a room and they look at arguments.
4191440	4195440	And then they disagree about the arguments and try to shoot down each other's theories.
4195440	4202440	And in this way they make progress and it's painful and takes thousands of years, but even an undergrad student can contribute.
4202440	4204440	And Buddhism is not like this.
4204440	4206440	Buddhists are always right about everything.
4206440	4211440	I've never heard the Buddhists say something bad about, say, race or abortion or anything else.
4211440	4216440	They're always right, which is extremely suspicious even for super complicated issues like abortion.
4216440	4218440	How is that possible?
4218440	4220440	Of course that's by design.
4220440	4224440	Buddhists train themselves to be right about everything.
4224440	4230440	And when they talk about their insights, they expect you to have a certain facial expression when you listen.
4230440	4233440	That is compatible to the facial expression when they make it.
4233440	4236440	What they say is extremely sacred and correct.
4236440	4241440	And it's very impolite to not make the same expression and to talk in the same way.
4241440	4243440	This is very suspicious.
4243440	4244440	It's manipulative.
4244440	4246440	It's not rational.
4246440	4251440	And I'm pretty sure that there is philosophy behind the whole thing, but it's not like you can discuss it.
4251440	4257440	Because the people that talk to you, they tell you the reason why this is true is because it alleviates suffering.
4257440	4261440	In order to alleviate suffering, listen to the following wise men.
4261440	4263440	And they figured this out.
4263440	4267440	But you're not getting involved with the steps.
4267440	4271440	This is not philosophy. This is a cult.
4271440	4279440	And so there might be philosophy there, but because I cannot question it, because they don't see the rational steps and so on.
4279440	4281440	I cannot use it.
4281440	4285440	I can make my own conclusions and I look to which degree they're compatible.
4285440	4288440	And they are, which is very satisfying.
4288440	4298440	But I find that I get to be in agreement with most of the introspective psychology of Buddhists, despite not studying Buddhism.
4298440	4301440	That's satisfying.
4301440	4311440	But by itself, I don't know to which degree Buddhism is correct because they don't show me the arguments or the measurements or the experiments.
4311440	4317440	Maybe there's some kind of ideology or cult stacked on top of the truth.
4317440	4320440	So that's how you're able to experience.
4320440	4325440	The convergence you explained definitely resonated with me.
4325440	4329440	And I think in hindsight is why I felt compelled to reach out to you.
4329440	4335440	Although to harken back to a point you made earlier in the episode, you had said you're weary of aesthetics.
4335440	4339440	You said if it sounds too good to be true, then maybe it's too good to be true.
4339440	4344440	Should we not apply that lens to what you're saying here?
4344440	4354440	If I would make steps towards Buddhism, to try to adapt my theories to what the Buddhists are saying, then I would be suspicious.
4354440	4359440	But I'm always trying to see whether the words that I use mean certain things.
4359440	4367440	And so my perspective is still the one of these computer scientists that is thinking about how can I implement the things that I'm talking about.
4367440	4372440	And very often my ideas are not at the level where I can have a specification that I can implement.
4372440	4376440	So I have a strong intuition of what self-organizing software looks like.
4376440	4381440	But I cannot implement a general self-organizing computational paradigm.
4381440	4387440	And until I am there, I need to be skeptical of my own ideas.
4387440	4396440	And the fact that almost nothing in other cultures makes sense unless we assume that there is self-organizing software.
4397440	4402440	And self-organizing software is what before the Enlightenment was called spirit.
4402440	4407440	And after the Enlightenment, we forgot the notion and thought it's a superstition that is weirdly shared by all sorts of cultures.
4407440	4410440	But only we have discovered that it doesn't exist.
4410440	4416440	And I think now we are rediscovering via the notion of software and control and nature.
4416440	4419440	That is to me, it's very interesting and it's tempting.
4419440	4425440	Maybe it's too tempting, but I'm quite optimistic that it works out.
4426440	4432440	And if not, then I was too curious and creative and somebody else is going to build something that actually works.
4432440	4435440	But you had fun doing it, meanwhile.
4435440	4439440	Not always. It's not always.
4439440	4446440	The question I want to ask is maybe too big of a question to tackle in the remaining time.
4446440	4449440	I'll throw it out there and then you tell me if we can't answer this.
4449440	4455440	The final question I have for you only takes like 20 seconds to answer.
4456440	4465440	I struggle with what is the underlying code, underlying software is...
4465440	4469440	Sorry, underlying software is code, underlying the code is bits, etc.
4469440	4471440	You go down and down the stack.
4471440	4482440	When we talk about our kind of natural software, is there a level of abstraction or a level of organization at which we say like,
4482440	4486440	that's the animation, that's where the animation exists.
4486440	4492440	How do we have this thing that just has the infinite depth yet has animation?
4492440	4497440	Where does the animation live at what level?
4497440	4502440	The reason why the universe exists probably is because it's possible that it exists.
4502440	4506440	There's nothing before base reality per definition.
4506440	4514440	Nothing exists before base reality that could act as a substrate or decide whether it exists or not.
4514440	4521440	The base reality itself is unconstrained by such concerns, which means it's undecided whether it exists or not.
4521440	4528440	You get an existing and non-existing branch and the non-existing branch doesn't have any observers that complain.
4528440	4535440	In the existing branch, we need to decide why certain things are happening and others are not happening.
4535440	4540440	The easiest explanation is that basically all the things are happening.
4540440	4545440	One way of looking at the universe is simply all operators.
4545440	4550440	Some of these operators are basic pairs which take an input and give you an output.
4550440	4554440	They associate two states with each other and they produce the animation.
4554440	4559440	That would mean that whenever you have a certain pattern and there's an operator that matches with it,
4559440	4564440	it bases it by the success pattern because nothing decides between the operators.
4564440	4568440	All operators are applied, which means the universe is branching all the time.
4568440	4572440	At every step, the universe is branching in an unbounded way.
4572440	4579440	Most of these branches are not going to lead to structure because you just get patterns that are replaced by other patterns.
4580440	4587440	But sometimes these patterns need to an error-correcting code to something that stabilizes itself.
4587440	4593440	An example for an error-correcting code that I often use is, imagine you sit at a bathtub, you move your hand,
4593440	4600440	you see a bunch of waves emerging on the surface of the bathtub and most of these waves just disappear after a while.
4600440	4604440	They just evaporate and the only vortices remain.
4604440	4609440	These vortices remain because there are waves in which the water moves in a circular pattern
4609440	4615440	so the information remains constrained to a certain volume. It does not dissipate.
4615440	4621440	This vortex is something like a particle now. It moves around until it bounces into other vortices
4621440	4627440	and then it can scatter into smaller vortices where it is larger one or it can disappear.
4627440	4630440	What if particles are like this?
4630440	4636440	Particles are simple error-correcting codes that emerge on these branching patterns of the underlying substrate.
4636440	4641440	Once you have these stable particles, they can arrange themselves into molecules
4641440	4646440	and then once you have molecules, you can make more interesting stuff like cells for them.
4646440	4651440	At every level of organization, you have error-correction on a higher level that is able to make that thing,
4651440	4657440	despite being more brittle, mushy and complex, stable over a wider range of circumstances.
4658440	4660440	This would be the perspective.
4660440	4666440	At some level, because the possibility exists, the possibility of building structure
4666440	4672440	as a result of a bubble of entropy like the inside of a star,
4672440	4678440	it's possible in a solar system around that start for structure like ours to exist.
4678440	4685440	I know we're at time. My final question, I promise, only takes 20 seconds to flip it back around on you.
4685440	4690440	What's one question you would leave me and listeners with, whether to think about or act on?
4690440	4694440	Don't really know what your listeners are at.
4694440	4696440	Whatever question you want.
4696440	4699440	My experience generalizes very, very quickly.
4699440	4707440	I would like us to think about how can we build a coherent world with each other?
4707440	4712440	How can we make sure that this project of humanity does not end prematurely?
4712440	4718440	How can we build shared agency, collective agency with each other in ways that are non-coercive
4718440	4724440	and allow us to understand our relationship with reality more deeply?
4724440	4727440	To me, that's the most important question.
4727440	4731440	It's one where I like to collaborate with the world.
4731440	4735440	I suspect that's also, to some degree, the intent of your podcast.
4735440	4737440	It is, yes.
4738440	4739440	Excellent.
4739440	4742440	Yosha, thank you so much for your time. This was very eye-opening.
4742440	4747440	I have a lot of reading to do after this, but thank you for looking forward to publishing this one.
4747440	4750440	Thank you very much. Thanks for inviting me.
