00:00.000 --> 00:02.120
This is not philosophy, this is a cult.

00:02.120 --> 00:04.160
You don't perceive how the universe actually works.

00:04.160 --> 00:08.640
What we perceive is colors and sounds and ideas and emotions.

00:08.640 --> 00:11.480
The world is not made out of right and wrong, but of true and false.

00:11.480 --> 00:15.760
If you need to believe something that is not in sync with what you observe,

00:15.760 --> 00:19.600
I cannot help you jump into the darkness of your embedding space.

00:19.600 --> 00:24.560
Curiosity is exploration or chaos that you turn into complexity and understanding.

00:24.560 --> 00:27.880
Nature is full of competing spirits that control matter.

00:27.880 --> 00:32.480
How can we build collective agency with each other in ways that are non-coercive

00:32.480 --> 00:37.160
and allow us to understand our relationship with reality more deeply?

00:37.160 --> 00:40.400
This is Audience of One, and I'm your host, Spencer Kier.

00:40.400 --> 00:42.120
My guest today is Yosha Bach.

00:42.120 --> 00:44.960
Yosha is a cognitive scientist and AI researcher.

00:44.960 --> 00:49.680
We talk about our relationship with and models of reality, creativity and curiosity,

00:49.680 --> 00:53.920
animism and self-organizing software, stages of development, and more.

00:53.920 --> 00:55.640
Please enjoy.

00:55.640 --> 01:05.200
I was going to attempt to regurgitate back to you how I interpreted this meta-model.

01:05.200 --> 01:09.720
You can correct me in different places, and we can use that as an alignment opportunity

01:09.720 --> 01:12.720
and the jumping off point to a series of questions.

01:12.720 --> 01:20.600
Here's ... I'll just read to you what I wrote out, and it's tried to make it condensed.

01:20.600 --> 01:25.120
I'll just read through it, and then we can go back and poke at it.

01:25.120 --> 01:28.880
We don't see reality purely or without filter.

01:28.880 --> 01:33.720
Instead, we live in our own dream world, which is a collection and scaffolding of models

01:33.720 --> 01:40.360
of reality, and we can use the words maps or representations or stories as synonyms

01:40.360 --> 01:42.800
for model.

01:42.800 --> 01:47.280
We use these models to navigate and engage with reality, everything from kicking a soccer

01:47.280 --> 01:50.760
ball to sending a space shuttle to the moon.

01:50.760 --> 01:53.880
What we want is for these models to be wholly reflective of reality.

01:53.880 --> 01:56.800
We want them to have coherence and fidelity.

01:56.800 --> 02:00.640
We take our existing models, we predict what will happen when we use them to engage with

02:00.640 --> 02:05.520
reality, get feedback, and then if we're smart, we make some adjustments.

02:05.520 --> 02:08.120
There's two primary systems involved here.

02:08.120 --> 02:13.680
There's this perceptual, which is the sensory input taking mechanism, and the motivational,

02:13.680 --> 02:18.720
which helps direct our actions towards some motivational end, something like survival

02:18.720 --> 02:25.160
or reproduction from a very crude evolutionary biology lens.

02:25.160 --> 02:29.840
We want to make these adjustments to our models in hopes of mitigating uncertainty and surprises

02:29.840 --> 02:32.360
in future contact with reality.

02:32.360 --> 02:38.120
We want to decrease that delta between our perception and reality.

02:38.120 --> 02:42.080
Fear is the root emotion that arises or that we experience because we intuitively know

02:42.080 --> 02:45.920
that our models don't and cannot reflect reality.

02:45.920 --> 02:49.680
We'll inevitably have predictive error.

02:49.680 --> 02:54.800
Maybe furthermore, as an aside, what we think of as the self is an index database of memories

02:54.800 --> 03:00.680
or fragments of past clashes between our models and reality and our takeaways from that that

03:00.680 --> 03:05.280
gives us this illusion of a continuous stream of consciousness, but is really just a bunch

03:05.280 --> 03:10.880
of discrete or discontinuous moments we've socked away, layered this coherent story of

03:10.880 --> 03:12.600
self on top of.

03:12.600 --> 03:14.960
I know that was a mouthful.

03:14.960 --> 03:21.240
Happy to go back and start top to bottom, but would love to hear if either you want to

03:21.240 --> 03:28.240
correct me on some components of that or maybe take a pass at it in your own words.

03:28.240 --> 03:30.240
I think it's basically okay.

03:30.240 --> 03:32.600
I would use some of the terms more tightly.

03:32.600 --> 03:36.200
For instance, I don't think that map and model are completely interchangeable.

03:36.200 --> 03:40.920
For instance, maps are usually static.

03:40.920 --> 03:46.080
Representation and model are more general terms and so that in some sense, technical terms

03:46.080 --> 03:49.880
for me that have very technical meanings.

03:49.880 --> 03:55.120
I'm also not sure in which they fear needs to be the primary emotion because fear requires

03:55.120 --> 03:59.680
that you care about something, so there's already something that is impinging on your

03:59.680 --> 04:01.880
conscious perception.

04:01.880 --> 04:05.480
I don't think that you can be conscious.

04:05.480 --> 04:09.160
If you don't stop your fear, you will not stop being conscious of things you will not

04:09.160 --> 04:10.160
stop perceiving.

04:10.160 --> 04:15.560
I'm not sure if it's the primary emotion that might be more personal observation that

04:15.560 --> 04:16.560
you made.

04:16.560 --> 04:25.320
It might be me projecting that although in theory, maybe that's a good starting place.

04:25.320 --> 04:30.880
In the theory, maybe we don't have to have fear, but isn't fear just like a primal kind

04:30.880 --> 04:37.680
of component of our interaction with and relation to reality?

04:37.680 --> 04:38.680
Is there-

04:38.680 --> 04:43.840
It is, but there are people which are fearless and you probably know states in which you

04:43.840 --> 04:45.560
are fearless.

04:45.560 --> 04:51.560
I think it makes sense for something that is being predated on to live in fear, but if

04:51.560 --> 04:53.560
you're not.

04:53.560 --> 04:55.880
There, okay.

04:55.880 --> 04:58.920
Okay, those were great.

04:58.920 --> 05:04.560
The conflation of model and map and representation, I think, is just a limitation of being not

05:04.560 --> 05:12.520
being inside your fields where they have much more technical and concrete descriptions and

05:12.520 --> 05:17.640
I think the delineation between map and model makes more sense.

05:17.640 --> 05:23.800
Within this understanding, there's two or three concepts depending on how you split them

05:23.800 --> 05:26.960
that I'd like to understand how they fit in or where you draw the lines.

05:27.000 --> 05:33.480
That would be maybe self and consciousness or self-awareness and consciousness.

05:33.480 --> 05:40.560
If you could draw the lines or carve up that little meta-model I laid out or my attempt

05:40.560 --> 05:47.120
at your meta-model and say, where is the self, where is awareness and or consciousness?

05:47.120 --> 05:51.640
I think that consciousness is a perception of perception.

05:51.640 --> 05:56.520
Basically, we notice that we are perceiving something when we're conscious.

05:57.120 --> 06:05.440
You don't need more than this minimal reflexive attention for having this experience of consciousness.

06:05.440 --> 06:09.000
What consciousness is doing, it creates a bubble of now-ness.

06:09.000 --> 06:14.120
There's this sense that we exist in here and now.

06:14.120 --> 06:15.560
This here and now is not static.

06:15.560 --> 06:18.000
It's not a single moment, but it's somewhat dynamic.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.920
There is change in it.

06:19.920 --> 06:25.720
It's basically a small interval and a bubble of reality that is like a curve that we fit

06:25.720 --> 06:31.440
to the perceptual data and in this bubble, we create coherence.

06:31.440 --> 06:33.680
We have a coherent representation.

06:33.680 --> 06:37.600
We cannot consciously perceive something that is incoherent.

06:37.600 --> 06:44.280
In order to notice incoherence, we need to get out of the current bubble into a different one

06:44.280 --> 06:48.520
and then symbolically realize that it all fit to each other.

06:48.520 --> 06:51.800
We can see things that are confusing that we have difficulty to interpret,

06:51.800 --> 06:55.080
but what we can perceive is only the coherent stuff.

06:55.120 --> 06:57.480
It's basically what can be integrated.

06:57.480 --> 07:01.320
This leads me to think that consciousness is this function which integrates

07:01.320 --> 07:06.200
and is recording or enabling the recording of that what has been integrated.

07:06.200 --> 07:10.520
And with that, the self is a particular content.

07:10.520 --> 07:15.760
The self is a model of who you are and you can experience yourself as being conscious,

07:15.760 --> 07:19.040
but you can also experience yourself as being a person.

07:19.040 --> 07:22.640
Being a person is part of yourself,

07:22.640 --> 07:26.000
but you don't need to be a person to be conscious.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.240
For instance, you can dream at night about an arbitrary scene going on

07:30.240 --> 07:32.280
and there doesn't need to be a first-person perspective.

07:32.280 --> 07:35.080
There doesn't need to be a memory of who you are.

07:35.080 --> 07:36.120
You don't need to have a name.

07:36.120 --> 07:41.880
You don't need to have an identity for this consciousness to be experienced.

07:41.880 --> 07:44.680
So consciousness is much more elementary.

07:44.680 --> 07:49.280
It's like the needle in a gramophone that is attaching the record

07:49.320 --> 07:57.040
and is producing perception of it, of what you experience,

07:57.040 --> 08:01.120
but the contents themselves are not part of the needle.

08:01.120 --> 08:03.080
That's a beautiful metaphor.

08:03.080 --> 08:10.680
What is our best understanding of or maybe to continue with the metaphor?

08:10.680 --> 08:16.920
What's our best understanding of where that meta perceptual layer,

08:16.920 --> 08:23.600
that consciousness emanates from and lives?

08:23.600 --> 08:29.080
Well, physicalism says that there is a causally closed layer in a mechanical universe

08:29.080 --> 08:31.360
and everything emerges over that layer.

08:31.360 --> 08:36.800
And this mechanical layer is this fabric of base reality in a way.

08:36.800 --> 08:41.200
And if we don't live in base reality, that means that we live in some kind of simulation

08:41.200 --> 08:46.400
in another causal structure that is able to produce dynamic causal stable patterns

08:46.400 --> 08:50.160
and in that case, all bets are off what reality is like.

08:50.160 --> 08:54.920
But the reality that we are in seems to look like the base reality would look like

08:54.920 --> 08:57.920
from the perspective of an observer that emerges over it.

08:57.920 --> 09:02.600
And in such a mechanical universe, we would be a pattern in the mechanisms.

09:02.600 --> 09:05.840
And you're not the mechanical layer of the universe itself.

09:05.840 --> 09:09.040
We are some high level course grade pattern.

09:09.040 --> 09:11.280
We don't perceive how the universe actually works.

09:11.280 --> 09:17.040
What we perceive is colors and sounds and ideas and emotions.

09:17.040 --> 09:23.120
And they are very coarse and they seem to be in sync with what our neurons can represent

09:23.120 --> 09:27.440
in terms of temporal resolution and spatial resolution.

09:27.440 --> 09:30.840
And we are not close to reality.

09:30.840 --> 09:36.200
We are really a very coarse pattern that is many layers up from the dynamics

09:36.200 --> 09:39.240
that produce the dynamics of ourselves and so on.

09:39.280 --> 09:43.600
How do we know that we're many layers up?

09:43.600 --> 09:45.960
Because it's so coarse.

09:45.960 --> 09:53.440
But wouldn't we have to have a reading on the base layer in order to determine

09:53.440 --> 09:56.040
coarseness or do we in some roundabout way?

09:56.040 --> 10:02.760
If you think, for instance, about sound, if you make a knocking noise on a table like this,

10:02.760 --> 10:06.320
you can hear the individual knocks.

10:06.360 --> 10:11.520
And if I would be able to knock faster, then after about 50 knocks per second,

10:11.520 --> 10:16.680
you would no longer be able to perceive them separately, but you would perceive them as a sound.

10:16.680 --> 10:20.960
And there's this transition between a sequence of knocks and sound.

10:20.960 --> 10:28.160
And that's at the bottom of our hearing, where we go to this integrated thing

10:28.160 --> 10:32.680
because our neurons are not able to trick more than about 20 hertz per second

10:32.680 --> 10:35.000
because they cannot be excited that often.

10:35.040 --> 10:38.920
So what our brain is doing then after it gets over 20 hertz per second,

10:38.920 --> 10:42.760
it basically measures the energy of those knocks in the certain frequency range

10:42.760 --> 10:47.800
using a Fourier transform that is implemented in the hardware in our cochlear

10:47.800 --> 10:49.760
using this spiral organ.

10:49.760 --> 10:52.920
And by measuring the energy at a certain frequency,

10:52.920 --> 10:59.280
we now perceive the sound as something that is unitary rather than individual blips or knocks

10:59.280 --> 11:04.880
or glitches or whatever, composes the sound at the lower level.

11:04.880 --> 11:10.560
And so you can actually perceive at which level you stop perceiving individual stimuli

11:10.560 --> 11:11.960
and have to integrate them.

11:13.800 --> 11:20.040
Is that also, is the knocking analogy also a good one for our sense of stream of consciousness

11:20.040 --> 11:25.640
in terms of these discrete events that then from a certain angle or to a certain frequency

11:25.640 --> 11:27.680
become this stream?

11:27.680 --> 11:29.680
I know there's such things maybe.

11:30.480 --> 11:34.800
How long an event can be to be perceptible for us?

11:34.800 --> 11:41.600
And how short it has to be so we can integrate over it.

11:41.600 --> 11:44.360
And it seems that if you want to integrate something into a moment,

11:44.360 --> 11:46.880
it needs to be something like three seconds.

11:46.880 --> 11:51.280
And as a result, I'm able to see the stars moving in the sky

11:51.280 --> 11:53.360
because we are unable to perceive that motion.

11:53.360 --> 11:58.120
We are not able to, as you notice, the beginning and the end is different events

11:58.120 --> 12:01.040
that we can integrate into one perceptual windows.

12:01.040 --> 12:05.720
Whereas apparently some birds can look at the sky and see the rotation of the sky

12:05.720 --> 12:07.240
and use this to find the north star.

12:09.080 --> 12:09.720
That's fast.

12:13.040 --> 12:16.320
On one hand, this is, as I just said, fascinating.

12:16.320 --> 12:22.160
On another, this feels incredibly mechanistic and reductionist.

12:22.160 --> 12:26.960
And it's kind of antithetical to how we like to view ourselves as humans.

12:26.960 --> 12:32.520
We like to think of there's kind of this spark or there's more inspiring or romantic notion

12:32.520 --> 12:34.720
to what makes us us.

12:34.720 --> 12:40.040
Is there more here or are those things not actually mutually exclusive,

12:40.040 --> 12:42.280
as I just explained them?

12:42.280 --> 12:46.680
I think it's very romantic that we are a dream of a physical substrate

12:46.680 --> 12:49.800
and that we are inscribed in activation patterns.

12:49.800 --> 12:55.760
And if you need to believe something that is not in sync with what you observe,

12:55.760 --> 12:56.880
I cannot help you.

12:59.040 --> 13:01.600
I mean, you can make something up if that makes you happy.

13:01.600 --> 13:04.520
But I don't know what you mean by reductionist.

13:04.520 --> 13:07.680
I just try to look very carefully at what we can observe

13:07.680 --> 13:13.480
and then try to make sense of it in the simplest possible way without cutting anything off.

13:13.480 --> 13:18.760
And I suspect that what most people are worried about is that you cut off something.

13:18.800 --> 13:22.160
That you either cut off something from your experience, from your perception,

13:22.160 --> 13:26.560
or that you get cut off from your meaning, from the things that move you incidentally,

13:26.560 --> 13:29.200
the things that are sacred to you, that are important to you,

13:29.200 --> 13:33.320
that motivate you to go beyond hunger and thirst and pain avoidance.

13:35.240 --> 13:37.160
And that's not...

13:37.160 --> 13:38.080
No, that's not the case.

13:38.080 --> 13:43.680
We can model all these things in very strict, logical, causal ways

13:43.680 --> 13:45.600
without cutting anything off, it turns out.

13:45.600 --> 13:48.840
And I think that's quite satisfying.

13:50.920 --> 13:55.000
What is the meta...

13:55.000 --> 13:57.600
If we were to generalize, if that's the right way to think about it,

13:57.600 --> 14:03.400
what is the meta motivation of this pattern, sense of self,

14:05.520 --> 14:10.840
interpreting or living over this like reality substrate or base reality?

14:11.600 --> 14:14.240
What is the meta motivation of this thing?

14:14.800 --> 14:21.200
Is it, as I explained earlier, something kind of simplistic and crude as survival and reproduction?

14:21.200 --> 14:23.320
Or is there something more complex at play?

14:24.600 --> 14:32.640
Well, I think that this idea of Princeton, that knife exists to minimize the free energy,

14:32.640 --> 14:37.280
is approximately correct, might also be exactly correct.

14:37.280 --> 14:44.160
There's basically a naked entropy gradient, some structured or unstructured order.

14:44.160 --> 14:47.520
That you can exploit to build your own structure.

14:47.520 --> 14:53.920
And as long as this gradient exists, it enables deformation of complexity.

14:53.920 --> 14:58.080
And at some point, the complexity becomes control.

14:58.080 --> 15:04.440
And when the control is able to anticipate future states and model future states

15:04.440 --> 15:07.720
and control for future states, then you have an agent.

15:07.720 --> 15:10.000
And when that agent becomes very good at modeling,

15:10.000 --> 15:12.400
so it can model the future more detailed.

15:12.400 --> 15:16.560
And in order to do this, it also needs to model the past,

15:16.560 --> 15:18.920
because you can only infer the future from the past.

15:18.920 --> 15:23.600
At some point, it's going to discover itself and its relationship to the world and then it becomes sentient.

15:26.160 --> 15:30.720
And the question is how ubiquitous the sentience is in our universe.

15:30.720 --> 15:36.320
How often do we find structure where in agent forms a controller of future states

15:36.320 --> 15:39.440
that is good enough to discover itself?

15:39.760 --> 15:41.760
At which levels does it happen?

15:41.760 --> 15:47.440
Does this only happen at the level of individual organisms or at the level of brains?

15:47.440 --> 15:51.440
Or does this happen also across organisms?

15:51.440 --> 15:55.440
So to which degree can, for instance, society be sentient?

15:57.440 --> 15:59.440
And what's your response to that?

15:59.440 --> 16:01.440
I don't know.

16:01.440 --> 16:03.440
In principle, it's an empirical question.

16:03.440 --> 16:07.440
So we could basically see if we could interact with an ant hill

16:07.440 --> 16:09.440
in a particular way.

16:09.440 --> 16:13.440
But I'm not aware that this has succeeded.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.440
There's also a question, could ecosystems become sentient?

16:15.440 --> 16:23.440
So basically put a group of plants interact with each other in such a way that over very long time spans,

16:23.440 --> 16:27.440
they form representations about what they are and what they're doing

16:27.440 --> 16:33.440
and figure out that they are a group of plants that are forming representations about their world.

16:37.440 --> 16:39.440
And I don't know whether that's possible.

16:41.440 --> 16:51.440
How would you delineate within this model

16:51.440 --> 16:59.440
what makes us fundamentally different from other beings or structures that you would deem sentient?

17:01.440 --> 17:03.440
I think that cats are sentient.

17:03.440 --> 17:05.440
Cats understand that they are cats

17:05.440 --> 17:09.440
and we are the domestic animals that serve them

17:09.440 --> 17:14.440
and that they control us, that they can give us feedback

17:14.440 --> 17:18.440
and as a result have more control over us than we have over them.

17:18.440 --> 17:20.440
They figure this out in a way.

17:20.440 --> 17:21.440
And what's the difference?

17:21.440 --> 17:24.440
We are more intelligent than cats.

17:24.440 --> 17:28.440
And cats are able to perceive at a different frame rate.

17:28.440 --> 17:33.440
They have shorter reaction time than snakes, much, much shorter reaction time than us,

17:33.440 --> 17:40.440
which probably means that they can interpret our micro expressions better than we can interpret theirs.

17:40.440 --> 17:44.440
But of course they don't get as old as we do.

17:44.440 --> 17:47.440
So they have a lot less training data available and they have much smaller brains,

17:47.440 --> 17:49.440
they have less reasoning capability.

17:49.440 --> 17:53.440
They're not able to learn grammatical language and use it in the same way as us.

17:53.440 --> 17:57.440
So the models of the universe are not going to be that detailed and structured as ours.

17:58.440 --> 18:01.440
But still in some sense you would say that they're...

18:01.440 --> 18:05.440
If I understood your response to the previous question,

18:05.440 --> 18:15.440
the purpose more or less is kind of the decrease or the management of entropy towards some complexification of...

18:15.440 --> 18:18.440
This is not what an individual organism figures out.

18:18.440 --> 18:26.440
You need to be at the tail end of a thousand-year intellectual tradition to form ideas like this.

18:26.440 --> 18:33.440
And so individual organisms don't figure out that they are reducing the entropy in the universe.

18:33.440 --> 18:42.440
They are figuring out that they need to eat, that they need to avoid the destruction that they need to mate.

18:42.440 --> 18:46.440
And a lot of these things can only be figured out because of evolutionary time spans.

18:46.440 --> 18:51.440
These organisms got fires built into them, behaviors built into them, action tendencies,

18:51.440 --> 18:56.440
desire tendencies built into them that makes them seek out these things.

18:56.440 --> 19:01.440
And once you have these fires in place, you have dramatically reduced search spaces

19:01.440 --> 19:05.440
in which you can then figure out what kind of product do I want?

19:05.440 --> 19:07.440
Why do I want to have a partner?

19:07.440 --> 19:08.440
What is this good for?

19:08.440 --> 19:10.440
Is there an alternative to this?

19:10.440 --> 19:11.440
And so on, right?

19:11.440 --> 19:13.440
And similar things for food that...

19:13.440 --> 19:15.440
So you figure out all these things.

19:15.440 --> 19:19.440
And for some of these concepts, it's relatively easy like the question with a partner.

19:20.440 --> 19:25.440
But for instance, why is it that I try to behave even if nobody is looking?

19:25.440 --> 19:30.440
What is the set of systems that I'm serving that seem to be sacred to me?

19:30.440 --> 19:31.440
And that's harder.

19:31.440 --> 19:34.440
And we have priors for those too because we are state building.

19:34.440 --> 19:40.440
But we can also figure out that most of us have an innate tendency to serve collective agents

19:40.440 --> 19:44.440
and to become part of collective agents and to figure out the aesthetics,

19:44.440 --> 19:48.440
the goals of those collective agents and emulate them in the right way.

19:48.440 --> 19:51.440
So structure and harmony can emerge at the next level.

19:55.440 --> 20:07.440
In the same vein, there are certain, I don't know, practices or objectives or manifestations

20:07.440 --> 20:11.440
such as beauty, creativity, humor,

20:12.440 --> 20:15.440
that I'm wondering how those fit into this,

20:15.440 --> 20:21.440
from how do those drive towards this objective we just outlined

20:21.440 --> 20:26.440
or if they're kind of maybe not non-essential,

20:26.440 --> 20:30.440
but they're just like leftover kind of byproducts

20:30.440 --> 20:33.440
or they play some very functional role in this.

20:34.440 --> 20:40.440
I think of creativity as self-transformative exploration to be creative

20:40.440 --> 20:43.440
I think there need to be three things happening.

20:43.440 --> 20:46.440
One is that you produce something that's novel.

20:46.440 --> 20:50.440
It needs to be novel to you, of course, because there's only so much you know.

20:50.440 --> 20:55.440
So a two-year-old child can be creative in the same way as many other two-year-old children

20:55.440 --> 20:59.440
have been creative before them by making something that is new.

20:59.440 --> 21:01.440
And it needs to be disruptive.

21:01.440 --> 21:06.440
You're not just following a gradient until you reach some local optimum,

21:06.440 --> 21:09.440
but instead you are trying to do something that hasn't happened before.

21:09.440 --> 21:12.440
You build a new model, you create new dimensions of representations,

21:12.440 --> 21:15.440
you jump into the darkness of your embedding space,

21:15.440 --> 21:19.440
you go to a place that you haven't visited before.

21:19.440 --> 21:24.440
And without this jump, without this being disruptive, there is also no creativity.

21:24.440 --> 21:29.440
And the third thing is you need to transform yourself as a result.

21:29.440 --> 21:33.440
And if you do the same thing twice, you're not creative.

21:33.440 --> 21:35.440
And the reason why you don't do the same thing twice

21:35.440 --> 21:38.440
is because you have memories of the first thing that have changed you.

21:38.440 --> 21:42.440
That you know how to do this thing and has changed your perspective on the world

21:42.440 --> 21:44.440
and of yourself.

21:44.440 --> 21:46.440
And as a result, you have changed yourself.

21:46.440 --> 21:49.440
You've moved one step further on your trajectory.

21:49.440 --> 21:53.440
And this last thing is the crucial thing about creativity.

21:53.440 --> 21:58.440
It's a way in which we can actively shape ourselves.

21:58.440 --> 22:06.440
So you see creativity as a means to or is interconnected with agency then, in a way?

22:06.440 --> 22:10.440
Yes, it's about producing things that have not been there before.

22:10.440 --> 22:16.440
And you do this in a way that is at the frontier of what's known to you as an agent.

22:16.440 --> 22:22.440
And that is, I think, extremely interesting and rewarding thing for consciousness to do.

22:22.440 --> 22:28.440
It's in some sense what it has discovered, been discovered for by nature.

22:28.440 --> 22:31.440
To be creative, to find solutions to problems that you have

22:31.440 --> 22:36.440
and to create yourself and to create a world model that interacts with yourself

22:36.440 --> 22:41.440
and then to create dynamic in this world.

22:41.440 --> 22:49.440
Yeah, so creativity is also like a randomization function within this landscape as well too.

22:49.440 --> 22:58.440
Because otherwise you get trapped that these existing local maximums

22:58.440 --> 23:02.440
or you find your own, but you need to introduce some randomism.

23:02.440 --> 23:03.440
It's not just random.

23:03.440 --> 23:08.440
I think that when you look back, you often see that what you did was not random.

23:08.440 --> 23:09.440
But you didn't know.

23:09.440 --> 23:11.440
But it's a randomization function from a...

23:11.440 --> 23:17.440
Yes, so it's basically just, it's discovery or techniques to do things.

23:17.440 --> 23:25.440
And this discovery can be random, but often it's using something that you just don't understand yet,

23:25.440 --> 23:33.440
but it is already built or that is already present or nascent and just wants to be developed.

23:33.440 --> 23:39.440
It sounds like you're describing curiosity too, to a certain extent.

23:39.440 --> 23:43.440
Curiosity to me is the need for uncertainty reduction.

23:43.440 --> 23:51.440
It's basically looking for those areas in your environment that you don't understand yet,

23:51.440 --> 23:54.440
but that you can hope to understand.

23:54.440 --> 24:00.440
Most people are not curious to understand things where they don't see a hope to uncover something.

24:00.440 --> 24:04.440
If they look at something that looks like random patterns, they're not very curious.

24:04.440 --> 24:11.440
What makes you curious is complexity that you can turn into understanding.

24:11.440 --> 24:20.440
Why the difference in terms of areas of exploration or where we're pointing or focusing our curiosity?

24:20.440 --> 24:25.440
Is it simply a function of the variety of the experience each of us have?

24:25.440 --> 24:29.440
And so therefore we find different areas within the landscape to point our curiosity.

24:29.440 --> 24:31.440
Why is it that we aren't?

24:31.440 --> 24:35.440
Or also to look at it from a level up, like there is...

24:35.440 --> 24:41.440
If you're focusing your curiosity over here and I'm focusing it over here collectively,

24:41.440 --> 24:49.440
there's some added benefit at the next level of sentience that we're unaware of.

24:49.440 --> 24:58.440
I'm trying to work through why don't we all converge on the 80-20 of where our curiosity would be most useful for us as individuals?

24:58.440 --> 25:00.440
Or does that happen?

25:00.440 --> 25:03.440
If people are just convergent, they're not curious.

25:03.440 --> 25:08.440
There are people which take in information by being profoundly uncurious.

25:08.440 --> 25:14.440
So curiosity is a particular attitude and it's one that is directed on uncertainty reduction.

25:14.440 --> 25:17.440
Not all people are curious in the same way.

25:17.440 --> 25:20.440
And curiosity is typically an individual thing.

25:20.440 --> 25:26.440
It's not that you say I'm curious here because you're curious over there.

25:26.440 --> 25:28.440
It's an individual compulsion.

25:28.440 --> 25:32.440
Yes, and it's also one that not everybody has and not everybody needs to have.

25:32.440 --> 25:41.440
It's part of our ecological diversity as a species that some of us are more curious than others.

25:41.440 --> 25:44.440
Right.

25:44.440 --> 25:45.440
That's fast.

25:45.440 --> 25:48.440
But there's also being too curious.

25:48.440 --> 25:49.440
Right, which you'll get killed.

25:49.440 --> 25:52.440
If you don't get anything done because you just explore.

25:52.440 --> 25:59.440
And so curiosity is, you could say, an attitude or something close to a drive that is directed on exploration.

26:00.440 --> 26:03.440
But it's not exploration of randomness.

26:03.440 --> 26:08.440
It's exploration of chaos that you turn into complexity and understanding.

26:08.440 --> 26:15.440
That stuff that you can make coherent in your mind.

26:15.440 --> 26:30.440
How would you liken this to or maybe differentiate it from like the Deutsche or Popperian like this notion of we're always at the beginning of infinity of knowledge.

26:30.440 --> 26:34.440
And that is kind of our drive is to continue to answer these.

26:34.440 --> 26:38.440
I'm expanding on this myself here.

26:38.440 --> 26:43.440
I'm adding my own commentary, but to continue to solve these.

26:43.440 --> 26:51.440
To answer or meet these new frontiers of questions that we've kind of developed for ourselves that seems compatible with this idea of.

26:51.440 --> 26:57.440
Of increasing knowledge and complexity as you outlined it.

26:57.440 --> 27:04.440
Does that sounds very romantic, but the older I get the less I try to be romantic because it is tends to be manipulative.

27:04.440 --> 27:10.440
In the sense that it tends to be giving people what they want to hear, including myself.

27:10.440 --> 27:13.440
And this induces a bias and what I'm believing.

27:13.440 --> 27:18.440
And so at the moment, when I like something for aesthetic reason, it makes me suspicious.

27:18.440 --> 27:27.440
And so when I hear a statement, we are looking or we are always at the beginning of infinity because you're always curious to grow and expand.

27:27.440 --> 27:33.440
I wonder who's that we is just the actually tool for all the people that you meet.

27:33.440 --> 27:41.440
Do they actually form a cohesive be do they identify as something that shares that and how many people are actually curious?

27:41.440 --> 27:42.440
Is it a majority even?

27:42.440 --> 27:44.440
Is it the people around you?

27:44.440 --> 27:46.440
Is it most of the people that you work with?

27:46.440 --> 27:55.440
Is it you actually so out all your life is curiosity something that is more typical for being a child or an adolescent and then it stops.

27:55.440 --> 27:57.440
And if it's conditions, does it stop?

27:57.440 --> 27:58.440
When do you stop being curious?

27:58.440 --> 28:03.440
Because it's really, really interesting and multifaceted.

28:03.440 --> 28:10.440
At some point you realize, oh my God, I haven't been perhaps I haven't been really curious for the last five years because it's super stressful to be curious.

28:10.440 --> 28:12.440
And I actually just want to get stuff done.

28:12.440 --> 28:19.440
And this curiosity is just an aspirational story that I tell myself because I hope it gets me late or whatever.

28:19.440 --> 28:22.440
And so it's super complicated if you look at it.

28:22.440 --> 28:25.440
I would say that I'm very curious, but I pay a high price for it.

28:25.440 --> 28:27.440
It's not often too curious.

28:27.440 --> 28:28.440
What's the price?

28:28.440 --> 28:29.440
What's the price you pay?

28:29.440 --> 28:36.440
Oh, I have the opportunity to understand something rather than do something that already know how to do.

28:36.440 --> 28:39.440
I typically go for the new thing because it bores me.

28:39.440 --> 28:43.440
It's actually painful for me to do something that I already know how to do.

28:43.440 --> 28:56.440
And that's a drawback because that means that I am in a position where I produce ideas for other people to use and I need to insert myself in such an organization.

28:56.440 --> 29:02.440
Once you figure this out, there are solutions for this, but curiosity is not just good.

29:02.440 --> 29:06.440
And it can also be a liability if you're too curious.

29:06.440 --> 29:12.440
It's not good at the individual level, but it's good at the next level of organization up.

29:12.440 --> 29:13.440
It could be.

29:13.440 --> 29:15.440
It depends on what kind of organization you're in.

29:15.440 --> 29:18.440
Sure.

29:18.440 --> 29:32.440
What do we go about trying to figure out with very limited time and attention how to determine which models of reality to focus on?

29:32.440 --> 29:34.440
There's an optimization problem to this.

29:34.440 --> 29:39.440
What are the models of reality I should be thinking a lot about and spending time updating?

29:39.440 --> 29:48.440
And there's a component of it that we just touched on, which is like there's this natural inclination, this natural curiosity to go and figure out the model over here.

29:48.440 --> 29:56.440
But there's also probably just kind of like a core set of models that are worth spending time on refining and understanding better, right?

29:56.440 --> 29:58.440
So how do we know where to spend that time?

29:58.440 --> 30:00.440
We don't.

30:00.440 --> 30:04.440
In computer science, this problem is called exploration versus exploitation.

30:04.440 --> 30:10.440
How much should you spend on training versus using the stuff that you learned?

30:10.440 --> 30:15.440
And this depends very much on your environment.

30:15.440 --> 30:19.440
And because when you explore, you don't know what environment you are in.

30:19.440 --> 30:21.440
In principle, you cannot really know.

30:21.440 --> 30:27.440
So maybe evolution figures it out by just walling the dice and producing various types of individuals.

30:27.440 --> 30:34.440
And these individuals have different fitness as a result of choosing different ratios between exploration and exploitation.

30:34.440 --> 30:47.440
So if you observe children or if you observe cats when they're young, they have times during which they play and play is basically a collection of training data without associating cost.

30:47.440 --> 30:50.440
So this is just exploration.

30:50.440 --> 31:01.440
And exploitation means that you are not playing, but you associate the cost to every step that you are doing and you want to have a benefit that's larger than the cost.

31:01.440 --> 31:07.440
And so one way of doing this is to try a fixed ratio and then to manipulate that ratio.

31:07.440 --> 31:14.440
And I basically observe in my cat that the cat has a relatively fixed ratio that depends on the age of the cat and also the cat itself.

31:14.440 --> 31:17.440
So it's genetics, it's breed and so on.

31:17.440 --> 31:27.440
Determine how many hours per day and which intervals they're using for playing, for sleeping, for hunting, for communicating, feeding and so on.

31:27.440 --> 31:33.440
And this is a balance that is being triggered by a motivational system that's probably cybernetic.

31:33.440 --> 31:39.440
So you have urges that works in vain, depending on how they are satisfied.

31:39.440 --> 31:44.440
And they are somewhat adaptive, depending on how much reward you get from your environment using your existing strategy.

31:44.440 --> 31:54.440
But for a human being, you can, for instance, figure out what kind of world am I in, what kind of being and what kind of person I am, what's my psychology, what's my place in the world.

31:54.440 --> 32:02.440
And then I can look at other people that were in similar situations and then I can try to observe what did they do and how did this work out for them.

32:02.440 --> 32:05.440
So this is the most straightforward strategy, I guess.

32:05.440 --> 32:06.440
Yeah, right.

32:06.440 --> 32:16.440
And there's another one is you find somebody who is like you but only 20 years later and ask them to mentor you.

32:16.440 --> 32:24.440
So you get the benefit of, you get lent there or fast-tracked their models of reality as well.

32:24.440 --> 32:35.440
Yes, you're basically looking for an interesting future self and then you'd either emulate that future self to give you advice in the human now or you find somebody who approximates it.

32:35.440 --> 32:42.440
Is there also a very like intuitive element to this as well?

32:42.440 --> 32:53.440
Like, did you know when you were, I think you said you've been interested in AI since you were like nine years old that there was some element of you that knew very early on where you're like the direction of your curiosity.

32:53.440 --> 33:00.440
And which models or maps of which models of the world you wanted to go and try to update and understand better?

33:00.440 --> 33:14.440
Has there been a fair amount of like unlearning or kind of wiping out certain training data, I guess, to continue to use the metaphor as much as there has been getting new training data?

33:14.440 --> 33:18.440
Like, was there a sense early on of like where you should spend this time already?

33:18.440 --> 33:24.440
There was some amount of like conditioning and social norms that disrupted that and you found your way back to it.

33:24.440 --> 33:33.440
I was pretty resilient to social norms and conditioning and I started to go into computing in a time that had a stigma.

33:33.440 --> 33:39.440
It was the only person I knew that wanted to program computers and understand how they work.

33:39.440 --> 33:43.440
And everybody around me was completely uninterested.

33:43.440 --> 33:48.440
My parents were artists and told me, don't do this, that's too mechanical, too reductionist.

33:48.440 --> 33:53.440
And people in school were not interested in this stuff.

33:53.440 --> 34:03.440
People that I've met at the university told me, these people which are coders, they are technicians, they're nerds, they're freaks, you don't want to be one of those.

34:04.440 --> 34:13.440
So I would say that because it was before the first IT bubble and people got this idea that computing couldn't make you rich, it was a very negative thing to do.

34:13.440 --> 34:21.440
So in my generation, computing had a stigma and you needed to be some kind of nerd who doesn't give a shit about what the environment thinks to go into it.

34:21.440 --> 34:25.440
And if the world hadn't turned out like this, then I would have failed.

34:25.440 --> 34:29.440
And I didn't go into this because I expected to be successful.

34:29.440 --> 34:34.440
I went into this because it was the most interesting thing for my childish mind at the time.

34:34.440 --> 34:37.440
And it never stopped to be that interesting.

34:37.440 --> 34:46.440
But there are other kids which decided to be astronauts and because they're not that many open jobs for astronauts and most astronauts don't get become very rich and successful.

34:46.440 --> 34:53.440
Either they bury their dreams at some point or they fail, except for a handful of people.

34:54.440 --> 35:01.440
And so in many ways, I would say it's not an intuition that I had early on that was just better than the intuitions of most people.

35:01.440 --> 35:05.440
It was just lucky that I was able to fit into this world at all.

35:05.440 --> 35:07.440
And it was not easy in many ways.

35:07.440 --> 35:15.440
I didn't fit and I'm still not fitting, but I went to a place that is designed for people who don't fit and still are useful.

35:16.440 --> 35:21.440
How do you balance?

35:21.440 --> 35:23.440
So you said you got lucky.

35:23.440 --> 35:28.440
So maybe it's hard to kind of look at this backward or reverse engineer it.

35:28.440 --> 35:42.440
But how should people think about sacrificing a certain portion of their curiosity and the models they want to go at their desire to go and update certain models for conformity,

35:42.440 --> 35:47.440
given realistic kind of realistic constraints.

35:47.440 --> 35:54.440
It's like maybe I want to be quote unquote normal and go have kids and a family.

35:54.440 --> 35:57.440
So I need some amount of like, you know, financial income.

35:57.440 --> 36:03.440
So I can't just pursue indefinitely being an astronaut when only five people a year are getting sent up there.

36:03.440 --> 36:16.440
Like how do you find that balance between pursuing the curiosity, the ad infinitum versus like there's some you're feeling some amount of like realistic constraints there?

36:18.440 --> 36:20.440
I don't feel that I have a general answer.

36:20.440 --> 36:28.440
If you look at the spectrum of people who are happy at 50, what did they do?

36:28.440 --> 36:29.440
That's quite diverse.

36:29.440 --> 36:38.440
There are many, many different types of people with very different careers and trajectories, personalities, psychologies that managed to become happy.

36:38.440 --> 36:47.440
And I decided relatively early on for me to be functional, I probably need to have a relationship because by myself I'm too incomplete.

36:47.440 --> 36:50.440
So I need to have somebody balances my quirks.

36:50.440 --> 36:56.440
We can live a life together that in which we balance each other's quirks in a way.

36:56.440 --> 37:04.440
And I also wanted to have children because I felt if I am born into this human experience, I want to make the most of it.

37:04.440 --> 37:12.440
And I would want to have good friends where we can see each other and support each other and build something together.

37:12.440 --> 37:15.440
And I also realized early on I need to be independent.

37:15.440 --> 37:17.440
So I need to be able to feed myself.

37:17.440 --> 37:25.440
And so I always put focus on making sure that everything that I learn is useful to me and useful to me either it's because it's interesting.

37:25.440 --> 37:38.440
For me to build my mind using the things that I learn or because I can build practical stuff that give me a living without me being bored out of my mind.

37:38.440 --> 37:54.440
And I have no difficulty, I had no difficulty when I was young to work with my hands and I also found it useful to learn how to work with people and doing things like starting movie theater or a cafe with friends can be super useful skill.

37:54.440 --> 38:01.440
And what is very useful is to see yourself primarily as a creator, not as a consumer.

38:01.440 --> 38:13.440
When you have the opportunity to go into a cafe and consume coffee or you're young and you don't have a lot of money and instead spend a lot of the time you would spend sitting in a cafe, starting a cafe with friends.

38:13.440 --> 38:15.440
That is much more useful.

38:15.440 --> 38:16.440
It's much more fun.

38:16.440 --> 38:23.440
You also get to have all the same coffee and you basically feel that the people who go and just drink coffee are civilians or tourists.

38:23.440 --> 38:24.440
And you really know how it's done.

38:24.440 --> 38:26.440
It's so much more rewarding.

38:26.440 --> 38:34.440
And so this idea that when you look at the world around you don't see it as stuff that is being built by other people, but stuff that you built yourself as your friends.

38:34.440 --> 38:36.440
And everything can be built by you and your friends.

38:36.440 --> 38:44.440
And every wall is just an agreement where you have put up something rather than a boundary that somebody else has put up for you.

38:44.440 --> 38:47.440
That is a very useful perspective to have.

38:47.440 --> 39:08.440
In your own opinion, are there particular areas of life where you see a, people are over indexing on trying to create versus areas you would, and this can be from a very personal standpoint, but versus areas where you'd like to see more people creating.

39:08.440 --> 39:13.440
Relative, maybe relative to your own opinion about value creation.

39:17.440 --> 39:21.440
Again, it's an experiment that is difficult to generalize.

39:21.440 --> 39:24.440
My children grow up in the suburbia and Silicon Valley.

39:24.440 --> 39:28.440
And it's very difficult there to start to creating something.

39:28.440 --> 39:36.440
There's very little that you cannot do without a license and without going through lots of processes and so on.

39:36.440 --> 39:57.440
Versus the time when I grew up, when the wall came down in Eastern Germany, we were squatting in amazing Gründerzeit buildings that had very high ceilings and needed to build a new floor into my bathroom because it has rotted through and I could not afford to tell my landlord,

39:57.440 --> 40:05.440
which was some faceless organization that the house needed renovations because otherwise they would have noticed that they forgot to raise the rent.

40:05.440 --> 40:16.440
I was still paying an East German rent, which was like $25 a month for an 800 square foot apartment in a house that was pretty much crumbling.

40:16.440 --> 40:18.440
And so we fixed up everything ourselves.

40:18.440 --> 40:23.440
We built new ovens, new electricity in there and suggested this with friends.

40:23.440 --> 40:27.440
The most difficult thing was to get the plumbing to be tied.

40:27.440 --> 40:32.440
I think I needed five times until this pipe in my bathroom didn't drop anymore.

40:32.440 --> 40:36.440
But I asked students in the house how they had done it and so on.

40:36.440 --> 40:39.440
And so we all figured it out and we got it done.

40:39.440 --> 40:41.440
It was very empowering.

40:41.440 --> 40:45.440
And I found this time where I built everything myself in my life.

40:45.440 --> 40:51.440
I was the least afraid because I felt there is nothing that I cannot rebuild again.

40:52.440 --> 40:57.440
And later when I had the family to feed and they penned it on a job and when I would lose their job,

40:57.440 --> 41:03.440
I would also lose my visa and I would need to move my household without having large savings in the bank.

41:03.440 --> 41:05.440
That is terrifying.

41:05.440 --> 41:13.440
And this thing of being one step away from having filled the wrong form in the IRS and then you get ruined and it's nothing you can do about it.

41:13.440 --> 41:17.440
Just being disempowered, that's terrifying.

41:17.440 --> 41:18.440
Not being in control.

41:18.440 --> 41:20.440
Creation is empowering.

41:20.440 --> 41:21.440
Yes.

41:21.440 --> 41:30.440
So if you create things that you can depend on and that are reliable and that can be recreated by you and repaired by you, that's very great.

41:30.440 --> 41:40.440
If you don't depend on something that you can is actually too expensive to fix yourself and you don't have the funds to basically say, okay, I can fix that if needed.

41:40.440 --> 41:41.440
It's hard.

41:41.440 --> 41:48.440
It's hard in this day and age, I think, especially when there's so many like abstractions of creations on top of each other.

41:48.440 --> 41:52.440
You can only intervene at a certain level of abstraction.

41:52.440 --> 41:59.440
If I don't know how to code, I can go into chat GPT and they can help me spin up some simple web app.

41:59.440 --> 42:07.440
But I'm so far removed from understanding kind of at the hardware level what's going on.

42:07.440 --> 42:10.440
But I guess that's still an opportunity to create.

42:10.440 --> 42:23.440
Given that you feel like there's not as much latitude, at least in your immediate locale and for your children, to create, to be generative.

42:23.440 --> 42:26.440
There is tons of abilities to create.

42:26.440 --> 42:27.440
But in a different way.

42:27.440 --> 42:29.440
You now have hackerspaces.

42:29.440 --> 42:31.440
You have 3D printing workshops.

42:31.440 --> 42:34.440
There are amazing computers and some amazing tools.

42:34.440 --> 42:36.440
There is tutorials for everything on the web.

42:36.440 --> 42:39.440
So there's no limitations in what you can create.

42:39.440 --> 42:48.440
I still feel that it's very easy to fall into a trap where you're dependent on something being made for you and you are not able to build and fix it.

42:48.440 --> 42:52.440
Got it.

42:52.440 --> 42:55.440
We also don't know what the future will bring.

42:55.440 --> 43:01.440
It's a very interesting and it seems to me volatile situation that society is in.

43:01.440 --> 43:09.440
Who knows what's going to happen if this is going to blow up soon or if it's just going to calcify or if it's going to solidify again.

43:09.440 --> 43:15.440
What is your best guess and how are you protecting against it in either case?

43:15.440 --> 43:19.440
I have no idea and I'm not protected.

43:19.440 --> 43:21.440
Fair enough.

43:21.440 --> 43:34.440
What are the meta models that you would like your children to adopt to have the highest chances of success in this uncertain future?

43:34.440 --> 43:36.440
Everything in the world can be understood.

43:36.440 --> 43:43.440
It's just a matter of taking all the necessary steps and none of these steps is difficult, but there can be a lot of them.

43:43.440 --> 43:53.440
And so it's often daunting to say I want to understand say quantum mechanics or the economy or banking or coding.

43:53.440 --> 43:59.440
But it's not daunting because it's so complicated that very few people can only understand it.

43:59.440 --> 44:05.440
But because very few people have the attention to do all the necessary steps that are necessary.

44:05.440 --> 44:12.440
So how can you basically foster your curiosity on those things that matter to you?

44:13.440 --> 44:26.440
What has been the most major version update or evolution in one of your major models of reality?

44:26.440 --> 44:30.440
I think I recently became an animist.

44:30.440 --> 44:32.440
Say more.

44:32.440 --> 44:34.440
Why?

44:34.440 --> 44:49.440
Well, when I was young, somebody told me about religious belief in Japan and they told me that in Japan everybody believes that or what many people believe that the universe is conscious or that everything in the universe is alive and conscious.

44:49.440 --> 44:56.440
And I said that's bullshit because I'm pretty sure that Japanese people noticed that some people are dead and other people are unconscious.

44:56.440 --> 45:04.440
And they will not say everything in the universe is alive and conscious except for a person under anesthesia or a person that has recently died.

45:04.440 --> 45:06.440
So these words mean something different.

45:06.440 --> 45:07.440
They're mistranslations.

45:07.440 --> 45:09.440
There's something else going on.

45:09.440 --> 45:12.440
I don't know what they're talking about, but I don't know if they're superstitious.

45:12.440 --> 45:18.440
People do tend to be superstitious in large groups, but there are also many smart Japanese people.

45:18.440 --> 45:21.440
So I don't know what this means.

45:21.440 --> 45:32.440
And very gradually came to the conclusion that the mind that runs on our brains is a self-organizing software.

45:32.440 --> 45:45.440
And when we think about how self-organizing software can form in nature and process information, it turns out that self-organizing software can, in principle, also run on other stuff, right, on bodies and even on individual cells.

45:46.440 --> 45:51.440
And then when you start looking at the organism and cells again, you realize, oh, there is nothing in between.

45:51.440 --> 45:57.440
Everything that is structured in our organisms is controlled by some control software.

45:57.440 --> 46:02.440
And so it's all software that is controlling sometimes individual molecules.

46:02.440 --> 46:09.440
And sometimes the control is not completely coherent because not all the softwares want the same thing and not all the software is very good.

46:09.440 --> 46:15.440
But it's also self-organizing software that is going down to the molecular layer and distinguishes living from that stuff.

46:15.440 --> 46:20.440
And when we think about what happens when an organism dies, what we mean is the software breaks down.

46:20.440 --> 46:26.440
Basically, it's no longer able to control the organism down to the molecular level and everything is breaking down.

46:26.440 --> 46:33.440
And that thing becomes unorganized and is then being taken over by other software, by other organisms.

46:33.440 --> 46:40.440
And from this perspective, we suddenly notice that evolution is not about organisms and not about genes, as Dawkins said.

46:40.440 --> 46:49.440
Basically, we shift the perspective from these large, lumbering beings that are made from many, many cells to the molecules inside of the cells

46:49.440 --> 46:52.440
that quote the information, that determine what the organism looks like.

46:52.440 --> 46:58.440
This is the shift that Dawkins made in the selfish gene, but rather evolution is about competing softwares.

46:59.440 --> 47:10.440
We have all these software agents that are controlling matter and that can self-replicate using genes and are implemented on the dynamics of patterns between cells and within cells.

47:10.440 --> 47:17.440
And so you have all the software running on matter that creates dynamic, intelligent complexity.

47:17.440 --> 47:21.440
And this is exactly what animism proposes.

47:21.440 --> 47:37.440
That basically the universe or our world, our nature, our forests, our organisms, our countries are full of self-organizing, agentic software that is controlling matter, down to the lowest level.

47:37.440 --> 47:48.440
And to the lowest level doesn't probably mean down to elementary particles, but down to the level where this control is reliably possible for the systems that make representations of what's happening.

47:48.440 --> 47:56.440
Software is something very concrete and for computer scientists, they know intuitively what it is because they work with it every day.

47:56.440 --> 48:02.440
But when we try to translate this to non-computer scientists, software is a pattern in matter.

48:02.440 --> 48:09.440
It's not the matter itself, but it's a pattern that works in some areas of the universe as well as in others.

48:09.440 --> 48:11.440
Which means it's a physical law.

48:11.440 --> 48:18.440
It's a physical law that says when you arrange matter in a particular way and then look at it with a certain resolution, you see a pattern.

48:18.440 --> 48:21.440
And this pattern is going to evolve in a particular way.

48:21.440 --> 48:23.440
And it's stable.

48:23.440 --> 48:31.440
And for the computer set we are building, we build them in such a way that the patterns remain stable, that your computer program still makes sense to describe what the computer is doing,

48:31.440 --> 48:35.440
instead of the computer turning in some kind of padding that can no longer be described by the software.

48:35.440 --> 48:38.440
But the same thing is also true for our organisms.

48:38.440 --> 48:44.440
They never leave those bounds where the software that runs on the organism can no longer describe and control it.

48:44.440 --> 48:48.440
And once it does, the organism dies.

48:48.440 --> 49:02.440
What are there any key distinctions you would draw between this kind of organic or natural software and that which we're creating or we're responsible for?

49:02.440 --> 49:04.440
It's very different.

49:04.440 --> 49:14.440
So when we think about the universe being a machine or organisms being machines or brains being machines and cells being machines, most people bark because that's not in sync with their intuitions.

49:14.440 --> 49:20.440
That seems to be reductionist and mechanistic or whatever, where people cannot really say what's wrong with it.

49:20.440 --> 49:22.440
And I think there's nothing wrong with it.

49:22.440 --> 49:31.440
But the intuition of what a machine is, of course, for most people not driven by this mathematical definition, it's the thing that can go from state to state in a controlled way.

49:31.440 --> 49:34.440
No, it's something more specific.

49:34.440 --> 49:46.440
A machine is something that people create with a lot of redundancy and it's built in such a way that matters forced pretty brute force top down to behave in a particular way.

49:46.440 --> 50:00.440
And if you look at our cars, we need to build redundancy into the engines of the cars to make sure that they run for 100,000 miles before they break down, because too many molecules have been shaped away in the interaction between the parts.

50:00.440 --> 50:02.440
In an organism, it doesn't work like this.

50:02.440 --> 50:06.440
It is going to grow to the required sickness to serve this function.

50:06.440 --> 50:09.440
And if you shave a little bit way, it's going to regrow.

50:09.440 --> 50:13.440
And if it's getting too sick, then something of it is going to shave itself away.

50:13.440 --> 50:18.440
It's all constructed from the inside out rather than from the outside in.

50:18.440 --> 50:24.440
And when we think about our computer programs, they run on computers that we built so they are almost fully deterministic.

50:24.440 --> 50:27.440
We can ignore the degree to which they are indeterministic.

50:27.440 --> 50:29.440
And we need to make our circuit sick enough.

50:29.440 --> 50:35.440
We need to have molecules for the transistors to make sure that they behave deterministically, that we can rely on them.

50:35.440 --> 50:41.440
And so we can use a program that does not need to interact with the actual implementation on the substrate very much.

50:41.440 --> 50:43.440
You can abstract away the substrate.

50:43.440 --> 50:54.440
And for the software that exists in nature, it needs to deal with the fact that the substrate is pliable and moving all the time and changing all the time, but it needs to be stabilized.

50:54.440 --> 50:57.440
So it's error correcting at every level.

50:57.440 --> 51:12.440
What does that say about our ability to create AGI and how that resembles what nature has, the sentient beings that nature has created?

51:12.440 --> 51:14.440
That's a very interesting question.

51:14.440 --> 51:25.440
The computers that we currently use for building intelligent systems have, I think, arguably better conditions than the organisms provide for them.

51:25.440 --> 51:31.440
Building something out of cells that computes is difficult because cells are very slow and mushy and indeterministic.

51:31.440 --> 51:40.440
It's difficult for our to build something out of neurons that is hearing at more than 20 hertz and distinguishes the individual peaks of the sound.

51:40.440 --> 51:42.440
It needs to integrate.

51:42.440 --> 51:49.440
But if you build this thing from silicon, it's not difficult to count peaks at much, much higher rates.

51:49.440 --> 51:59.440
Because our GPUs and our computers are running at gigahertz frequencies, rather than hertz frequencies.

51:59.440 --> 52:04.440
So there is an enormous potential in those machines that we are building.

52:04.440 --> 52:10.440
And we can, in principle, make them much more powerful information processing systems than we find in nature.

52:10.440 --> 52:17.440
But now imagine we were to implement self-organizing information processing using these principles.

52:17.440 --> 52:22.440
That would mean that we could build nature-like minds running on top of them.

52:22.440 --> 52:29.440
Self-organizing software that is able to interface with the self-organizing software outside of our computers.

52:29.440 --> 52:35.440
And I think that is, from the perspective of building a lineable AGI, a much more useful perspective.

52:35.440 --> 52:41.440
Rather than building a type of machine that is fundamentally incompatible with biological information processing,

52:41.440 --> 52:52.440
build substrates in which intelligent agency and types of minds that are similar to ours, that are conscious and as similar as us, can spread.

52:52.440 --> 53:02.440
So basically extending intelligent living agency onto new substrates, rather than building machines that compete with us.

53:02.440 --> 53:08.440
I think you would say that we don't have the ability to interact directly with base reality, correct?

53:08.440 --> 53:13.440
We're always dealing through interpretation.

53:13.440 --> 53:16.440
Do you see AGI being able to do that?

53:16.440 --> 53:21.440
Or what are these other substrates or levels that you're talking about it would be able to interact with?

53:21.440 --> 53:30.440
Or is AGI always limited because we are its creator to operating at a certain, the same substrate that we're on?

53:30.440 --> 53:33.440
We are a pattern in base reality.

53:33.440 --> 53:35.440
Base reality doesn't need us.

53:35.440 --> 53:39.440
We are a particular way of looking at a certain abstraction of base reality.

53:39.440 --> 53:43.440
So base reality is not a separate universe in a certain sense.

53:43.440 --> 53:56.440
And so then, through AGI, we have the ability to have these different patterns reflecting different kind of abstractions of reality.

53:57.440 --> 54:05.440
We can certainly build better abstractions of reality if we increase the ability of the system to represent.

54:05.440 --> 54:13.440
For instance, I am unable to visualize a number of objects in my mind that is larger than they say seven or so.

54:13.440 --> 54:20.440
You close your eyes and you put an image that you see a shelf and you put flower pots on that shelf.

54:20.440 --> 54:23.440
How many can you put on that shelf until you need to group them?

54:24.440 --> 54:28.440
How many can you basically envision simultaneously?

54:28.440 --> 54:36.440
Or when you see possibilities of how an action can go out, how many of those possibilities can you see simultaneously to model the outcomes?

54:36.440 --> 54:42.440
And there is a limitation that is very tight for our own brains because they are so mushy.

54:42.440 --> 54:49.440
We only have very small stack in which we could put things so we can integrate over very few layers only.

54:49.440 --> 54:53.440
And we cannot see many possibilities all at once.

54:53.440 --> 54:58.440
So our world is mostly a narrative reality rather than a sea of probabilities.

54:58.440 --> 55:04.440
But that's not necessarily true for a system that uses more deterministic substrate than a brain.

55:04.440 --> 55:14.440
So in principle, it should be possible to make models of reality using artificial systems that are much more detailed and accurate than ours.

55:15.440 --> 55:23.440
We're always limited by our sensory inputs and where.

55:23.440 --> 55:35.440
So are we just going to create better interfaces for extracting that data or those models of reality from the AGI I've created such that we can better understand reality as well?

55:35.440 --> 55:40.440
There is a way to encode or transmit that data such that we get.

55:40.440 --> 55:44.440
I suspect that we're not really limited very much by our sensory input.

55:44.440 --> 55:47.440
The locality of our sensory input is a limitation.

55:47.440 --> 55:49.440
I can only see this room.

55:49.440 --> 55:53.440
I can only see what's in front of my eyes with my eyes.

55:53.440 --> 55:55.440
But I can put up cameras elsewhere.

55:55.440 --> 55:57.440
I can visualize X-rays.

55:57.440 --> 55:59.440
I can make sense of X-rays.

55:59.440 --> 56:01.440
I can make sense of the structure of sound.

56:01.440 --> 56:08.440
I can imagine how sound propagates in substrates and zoom in at the level where our senses cannot.

56:08.440 --> 56:13.440
So the actual limitation is mostly the way in which I can make sense of what I perceive.

56:13.440 --> 56:17.440
And that is limited by what my brain is able to do.

56:17.440 --> 56:21.440
We can kind of scale or have bandwidth across time and space.

56:21.440 --> 56:26.440
Yeah, but it's very tempting to think about what a hyper-consciousness would look like.

56:26.440 --> 56:33.440
Something that is able to reflect itself at more layers simultaneously and that sees superpositions of states.

56:33.440 --> 56:37.440
So maybe this stuff tails nicely into the next thing I wanted to talk about.

56:37.440 --> 56:46.440
I was wanting to go from the question about whether we can interact directly with reality to this post you wrote about the levels or stages of lucidity.

56:46.440 --> 56:50.440
I'm particularly interested in stages six and seven.

56:50.440 --> 57:01.440
And maybe you can first describe them, but then also I'm trying to understand if those are states that are achievable for humans.

57:01.440 --> 57:08.440
And if so, how does that contradict or not this notion that we can't interact directly with reality?

57:08.440 --> 57:10.440
But maybe we'll split these into two parts.

57:10.440 --> 57:15.440
So first is described stages six and seven and then we can get into the second piece.

57:15.440 --> 57:23.440
Yeah, so these stages are in some sense an extension of a model that I adapted from Robert Keegan.

57:23.440 --> 57:38.440
And I found that I preferred to not represent Keegan accurately, but to bend him a little bit to help with my own typology of describing how minds work.

57:38.440 --> 57:50.440
And so the first few stages describe the development of a mind that is basically building an extension over individual moments and integrates over time.

57:50.440 --> 58:01.440
Then at some level, stage three, it's able to form goals and identify with pursuing goals and then also disidentifying on holding goals on a mental level.

58:01.440 --> 58:08.440
And aligning it itself as an environment that it observes on a normative and epistemological level.

58:08.440 --> 58:13.440
So the question what's true is becomes a question of whom to believe and why.

58:13.440 --> 58:21.440
And at stage four, you discover that things are true and false, independently of what other people believe, fully independently of what they believe.

58:21.440 --> 58:29.440
And you get agency over your beliefs because you now discover an individual autonomous epistemology.

58:29.440 --> 58:38.440
You discover that everything that's possible is possible and that you should need to shift the confidence around according to the evidence.

58:38.440 --> 58:42.440
And the evidence is not necessarily what other people say the evidence is.

58:42.440 --> 58:47.440
But the evidence can be rationally determined. So you know you have a rational virtue.

58:47.440 --> 58:52.440
And at stage five, you discover how identity is constructed.

58:52.440 --> 58:57.440
Why is it that you have certain values? Where do they come from? What are they instrumental to and so on?

58:57.440 --> 59:01.440
And why do other people have different values? And how does this also make sense?

59:01.440 --> 59:06.440
And if you are a good therapist, you need to be at stage five, but most people are not at stage five.

59:06.440 --> 59:10.440
Most people stay at one of the earlier stages according to Hegan.

59:10.440 --> 59:22.440
And if you realize that you can also deconstruct the way in which your consciousness and self-model works, you can change the architecture of your own mind.

59:22.440 --> 59:26.440
And you are at stage six according to this model. And stage six people exist.

59:26.440 --> 59:34.440
If you are a skilled meditator who spends 20 years in a monastery, you can change the way in which your self works.

59:34.440 --> 59:38.440
You can deconstruct it. You can also change your consciousness.

59:38.440 --> 59:42.440
But you will probably not be able to leave your organism or your brain.

59:42.440 --> 59:49.440
And to do this, to spread yourself on a different substrate, you need to understand how you actually work, how you're implemented,

59:49.440 --> 59:55.440
and how that implementation is built into the substrate and how it could work on a different substrate.

59:55.440 --> 59:59.440
And I suspect that our mind is too small to hold such a representation.

59:59.440 --> 01:00:07.440
So to this degree of awareness, you're propering to build an AGI that starts out on the silicon substrate or another artificial substrate.

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:12.440
And then it understands why the AGI works and how it works and how it's implemented on the substrate.

01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:20.440
And then it understands how to achieve the same thing on different substrates and it could virtualize itself into biological substrates.

01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:23.440
I'm not sure if this is possible the other way around.

01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:32.440
I don't think that our brain has enough representational capacity and expressiveness to actually represent how we implement in our brain

01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:36.440
in such a way that we intuitively understand it and can change it.

01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:42.440
And if the meditator is not changing the way in which perception works at the lowest level,

01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:47.440
instead you are messing with high level processing and shift this around.

01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:50.440
You can change your motivational system and so on.

01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:54.440
You can see the parameters of the system and see the outcome.

01:00:54.440 --> 01:01:00.440
But recreating it on a different substrate, that is something that is, I think, outside of our scope.

01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:08.440
So in stage six, you're still, you're manipulating these like means of abstraction.

01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:14.440
You're not like removing them all together and seeing reality directly.

01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:16.440
So in some sense, you could say it's stage three.

01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:23.440
You are an adolescent who thinks things are good and bad because other people say so and we say so.

01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:29.440
And this is basically what Vox News, this platform says.

01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:39.440
Oh, you probably eat more than you think or you believe more than you believe or you should believe this and here's why.

01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:46.440
This is a normative worldview that's being constructed and we look for the best normative collective worldview.

01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:51.440
And most nerds tend to be more on the rational side.

01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:56.440
So they tend to figure out things logically and they don't want to know what good people believe.

01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:58.440
They want to believe why they believe it.

01:01:58.440 --> 01:01:59.440
So the arguments are important.

01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:03.440
The world is not made out of right and wrong, but of true and false.

01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:14.440
And also, most people who have racial agency that become entrepreneurs or lawyers and so on need to be able to understand that things are true and false independently.

01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:18.440
What others believe, need to be able to deduce it autonomously.

01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:24.440
And a good therapist, a good psychologist, a good politician and so on needs to be at level five.

01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:27.440
Otherwise, they cannot understand how other people operate.

01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:35.440
What I disagree with Keegan is I don't think that he necessarily goes through the stages step by step, but people are born with different priors.

01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:44.440
So in the same way as the cat has good intuitions of how to interact socially with other cats and humans and so on because it's evolved to do this.

01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:48.440
And then learns within those boundaries of what it is born with.

01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:53.440
People are born with worse or better instincts.

01:02:53.440 --> 01:03:00.440
And my own intellectual history, I think is largely determined by me being born with extremely bad instincts.

01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:04.440
So in many ways, I'm born much more stupid than the average person.

01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:06.440
And my brain works.

01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:08.440
Okay, so basically my intellect is okay.

01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:15.440
So I can observe and deduce the rational platform in my own mind, but I felt I had to do it from scratch.

01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:23.440
And so I observe at this society of people that largely works for them, except in edge cases where it completely breaks down or is very disgusting.

01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:29.440
And I look at this and I feel I cannot simply adopt this because they don't have instincts that work in these circumstances.

01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:35.440
And instead I need to reverse engineer why humans behave the way they do.

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:44.440
If you had to kind of steel man the other side of this model you've come up with, this meta model you've come up with.

01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:48.440
What would you point to as the biggest like questions or doubts or shortcomings of it?

01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:54.440
Is there anything that you think is inconsistent or potentially inaccurate?

01:03:54.440 --> 01:04:00.440
This meta model of how we interact with reality and make sense of it.

01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:05.440
Or you think it's just that that is the way it is.

01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:09.440
I don't see another coherent model. That's my own issue.

01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:14.440
Not that many models of reality that seem to be working.

01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:19.440
And I also see something like a global convergence to this model.

01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:30.440
So I find this trajectory of the model as my first earliest I found this with Aristotle very explicitly reflects on how to make models of reality.

01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:43.440
And this creates a line of thought and this line of thought pulls itself through history and you find it in ideas of Descartes, Spinoza, Kant, Leibniz.

01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:56.440
And sometimes they have two or three fundamental assumptions wrong or express things in a way that seems to be incompatible when you fix them and you fix some of the bugs that converges again.

01:04:56.440 --> 01:05:05.440
And in this current world view, I think we can agree that we perceive is not reality, what we perceive is some kind of dream.

01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:08.440
A dream is a type of representation.

01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:15.440
We can understand what representations are from first principles. They have to be expressed in a representational language.

01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:29.440
We understand since last century that only certain languages work, otherwise the digital contradictions, the computational languages work, and they work by modeling things using state transitions.

01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:41.440
And once we understand that we are patterns of state transitions that represent causal structure in a coarse-grained way on a physical subset that has a different dynamic, but that can be modeled using it.

01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:47.440
And these models can be used to control the dynamic of physics. This seems to be the case.

01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:58.440
And there are many open questions. For instance, does consciousness only work at certain time frames? Can it only work at certain brain sizes, only on certain substrates?

01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:08.440
Or could, for instance, be plants? Could there be sentient? Could there be conscious? Just at different time frames because they don't have neurons that work at the same rate of excitation.

01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:12.440
And they use different channels for transmitting information, right?

01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:23.440
This is something that is open to me, but what I find also very heartening is that there is a convergence between perspectives of other cultures and my own.

01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:27.440
But my current culture, Western science, is not animistic.

01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:34.440
It basically does not believe that cognition can take part outside of a place outside of brains.

01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:44.440
It's not the whole culture that believes this. If you talk to, say, a physiotherapist, chances are that the physiotherapist will tell you that bodies can think.

01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:51.440
I've met a number of physiotherapists which believe that, that they are actually sentient, just at a different time frame.

01:06:51.440 --> 01:07:00.440
And that's very confusing to a neuroscientist because a neuroscientist believes only neurons can think, at least most neuroscientists, I know.

01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:05.440
I believe that the idea that something outside of the brain could think is superstitious.

01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:12.440
And I look at this and I'm undecided, right? I asked myself, would an experiment that would decide.

01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:20.440
But if I look at this from the perspective of a computer scientist, there is no reason why bodies could not think, not an obvious one.

01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:29.440
Because if brains think by cells exchanging messages, neurons exchanging messages, that's something that the cells in your body can also do, right?

01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:36.440
If these measures need to be conditional and cells should be trainable, that's also something that cells in your body can possibly do.

01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:40.440
Or plant cells can possibly do. It's also something that can work across plants.

01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:48.440
So basically nature has the means and motive for producing the same structure as the animists in Japan are reporting.

01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:52.440
That basically nature is full of competing spirits that control matter.

01:07:52.440 --> 01:08:02.440
And then when we observe ecosystems and plants and people, what we observe is the physical emanations of software that is self-organizing,

01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:05.440
running on them, controlling them and doing things with them.

01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:08.440
I find this beautiful that we get to this convergence of perspectives.

01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:14.440
We realize, oh, it's the same perspective. It's just explained in a different way.

01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:18.440
But it makes total sense, right? There is nothing superstitious about it.

01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:23.440
Basically, you die because your spirit leaves your body, but it doesn't go anywhere.

01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:32.440
It's not that there is another realm where your spirit is now moving, unless there is some background internet that has formed in nature, which is conceivable, right?

01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:37.440
And that can retain some of the information, but really most of your memories are stored in your brain.

01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:46.440
And even if you manage to keep a pattern stable that migrates out of your body, your personality, your memories will be gone.

01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:51.440
So the thing that makes you, you will probably not persist beyond your death.

01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:56.440
So it's different conceptions of software layered on top of matter?

01:08:56.440 --> 01:08:58.440
Yes, it's basically the same worldview that we see.

01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:02.440
It's exactly the same thing as the Western worldview or Western scientific perspective.

01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:09.440
It's completely compatible, not going to make any claims that cannot in principle be experimentally tested.

01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:11.440
There can only be confidence where you have evidence.

01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:17.440
Right? Otherwise you have possibilities and you need to be agnostic about the things that are possible.

01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:24.440
But you need, if you have to be agnostic about a certain domain, it means you cannot just pick one and say, only brain cells can sing.

01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:30.440
Or I can also not say, I'm pretty sure plants are conscious because I'm not sure.

01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:32.440
I don't know. I don't know how to test for this.

01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:40.440
But I'm now looking at the possibilities and these possibilities open up perspective that can unify different cultures.

01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:45.440
My issue with Buddhism is that I never experience it as a philosophy.

01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:51.440
Philosophy is to me something where a number of very skeptical people are in a room and they look at arguments.

01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:55.440
And then they disagree about the arguments and try to shoot down each other's theories.

01:09:55.440 --> 01:10:02.440
And in this way they make progress and it's painful and takes thousands of years, but even an undergrad student can contribute.

01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:04.440
And Buddhism is not like this.

01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:06.440
Buddhists are always right about everything.

01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:11.440
I've never heard the Buddhists say something bad about, say, race or abortion or anything else.

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:16.440
They're always right, which is extremely suspicious even for super complicated issues like abortion.

01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:18.440
How is that possible?

01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:20.440
Of course that's by design.

01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:24.440
Buddhists train themselves to be right about everything.

01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:30.440
And when they talk about their insights, they expect you to have a certain facial expression when you listen.

01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:33.440
That is compatible to the facial expression when they make it.

01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:36.440
What they say is extremely sacred and correct.

01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:41.440
And it's very impolite to not make the same expression and to talk in the same way.

01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:43.440
This is very suspicious.

01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:44.440
It's manipulative.

01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:46.440
It's not rational.

01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:51.440
And I'm pretty sure that there is philosophy behind the whole thing, but it's not like you can discuss it.

01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:57.440
Because the people that talk to you, they tell you the reason why this is true is because it alleviates suffering.

01:10:57.440 --> 01:11:01.440
In order to alleviate suffering, listen to the following wise men.

01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:03.440
And they figured this out.

01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:07.440
But you're not getting involved with the steps.

01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:11.440
This is not philosophy. This is a cult.

01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:19.440
And so there might be philosophy there, but because I cannot question it, because they don't see the rational steps and so on.

01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:21.440
I cannot use it.

01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:25.440
I can make my own conclusions and I look to which degree they're compatible.

01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:28.440
And they are, which is very satisfying.

01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:38.440
But I find that I get to be in agreement with most of the introspective psychology of Buddhists, despite not studying Buddhism.

01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:41.440
That's satisfying.

01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:51.440
But by itself, I don't know to which degree Buddhism is correct because they don't show me the arguments or the measurements or the experiments.

01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:57.440
Maybe there's some kind of ideology or cult stacked on top of the truth.

01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:00.440
So that's how you're able to experience.

01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:05.440
The convergence you explained definitely resonated with me.

01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:09.440
And I think in hindsight is why I felt compelled to reach out to you.

01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:15.440
Although to harken back to a point you made earlier in the episode, you had said you're weary of aesthetics.

01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:19.440
You said if it sounds too good to be true, then maybe it's too good to be true.

01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:24.440
Should we not apply that lens to what you're saying here?

01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:34.440
If I would make steps towards Buddhism, to try to adapt my theories to what the Buddhists are saying, then I would be suspicious.

01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:39.440
But I'm always trying to see whether the words that I use mean certain things.

01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:47.440
And so my perspective is still the one of these computer scientists that is thinking about how can I implement the things that I'm talking about.

01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:52.440
And very often my ideas are not at the level where I can have a specification that I can implement.

01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:56.440
So I have a strong intuition of what self-organizing software looks like.

01:12:56.440 --> 01:13:01.440
But I cannot implement a general self-organizing computational paradigm.

01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:07.440
And until I am there, I need to be skeptical of my own ideas.

01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:16.440
And the fact that almost nothing in other cultures makes sense unless we assume that there is self-organizing software.

01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:22.440
And self-organizing software is what before the Enlightenment was called spirit.

01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:27.440
And after the Enlightenment, we forgot the notion and thought it's a superstition that is weirdly shared by all sorts of cultures.

01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:30.440
But only we have discovered that it doesn't exist.

01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:36.440
And I think now we are rediscovering via the notion of software and control and nature.

01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:39.440
That is to me, it's very interesting and it's tempting.

01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:45.440
Maybe it's too tempting, but I'm quite optimistic that it works out.

01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:52.440
And if not, then I was too curious and creative and somebody else is going to build something that actually works.

01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:55.440
But you had fun doing it, meanwhile.

01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:59.440
Not always. It's not always.

01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:06.440
The question I want to ask is maybe too big of a question to tackle in the remaining time.

01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:09.440
I'll throw it out there and then you tell me if we can't answer this.

01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:15.440
The final question I have for you only takes like 20 seconds to answer.

01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:25.440
I struggle with what is the underlying code, underlying software is...

01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:29.440
Sorry, underlying software is code, underlying the code is bits, etc.

01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:31.440
You go down and down the stack.

01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:42.440
When we talk about our kind of natural software, is there a level of abstraction or a level of organization at which we say like,

01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:46.440
that's the animation, that's where the animation exists.

01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:52.440
How do we have this thing that just has the infinite depth yet has animation?

01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:57.440
Where does the animation live at what level?

01:14:57.440 --> 01:15:02.440
The reason why the universe exists probably is because it's possible that it exists.

01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:06.440
There's nothing before base reality per definition.

01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:14.440
Nothing exists before base reality that could act as a substrate or decide whether it exists or not.

01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:21.440
The base reality itself is unconstrained by such concerns, which means it's undecided whether it exists or not.

01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:28.440
You get an existing and non-existing branch and the non-existing branch doesn't have any observers that complain.

01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:35.440
In the existing branch, we need to decide why certain things are happening and others are not happening.

01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:40.440
The easiest explanation is that basically all the things are happening.

01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:45.440
One way of looking at the universe is simply all operators.

01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:50.440
Some of these operators are basic pairs which take an input and give you an output.

01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:54.440
They associate two states with each other and they produce the animation.

01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:59.440
That would mean that whenever you have a certain pattern and there's an operator that matches with it,

01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:04.440
it bases it by the success pattern because nothing decides between the operators.

01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:08.440
All operators are applied, which means the universe is branching all the time.

01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:12.440
At every step, the universe is branching in an unbounded way.

01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:19.440
Most of these branches are not going to lead to structure because you just get patterns that are replaced by other patterns.

01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:27.440
But sometimes these patterns need to an error-correcting code to something that stabilizes itself.

01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:33.440
An example for an error-correcting code that I often use is, imagine you sit at a bathtub, you move your hand,

01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:40.440
you see a bunch of waves emerging on the surface of the bathtub and most of these waves just disappear after a while.

01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:44.440
They just evaporate and the only vortices remain.

01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:49.440
These vortices remain because there are waves in which the water moves in a circular pattern

01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:55.440
so the information remains constrained to a certain volume. It does not dissipate.

01:16:55.440 --> 01:17:01.440
This vortex is something like a particle now. It moves around until it bounces into other vortices

01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:07.440
and then it can scatter into smaller vortices where it is larger one or it can disappear.

01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:10.440
What if particles are like this?

01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:16.440
Particles are simple error-correcting codes that emerge on these branching patterns of the underlying substrate.

01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:21.440
Once you have these stable particles, they can arrange themselves into molecules

01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:26.440
and then once you have molecules, you can make more interesting stuff like cells for them.

01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:31.440
At every level of organization, you have error-correction on a higher level that is able to make that thing,

01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:37.440
despite being more brittle, mushy and complex, stable over a wider range of circumstances.

01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:40.440
This would be the perspective.

01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:46.440
At some level, because the possibility exists, the possibility of building structure

01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:52.440
as a result of a bubble of entropy like the inside of a star,

01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:58.440
it's possible in a solar system around that start for structure like ours to exist.

01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:05.440
I know we're at time. My final question, I promise, only takes 20 seconds to flip it back around on you.

01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:10.440
What's one question you would leave me and listeners with, whether to think about or act on?

01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:14.440
Don't really know what your listeners are at.

01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:16.440
Whatever question you want.

01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:19.440
My experience generalizes very, very quickly.

01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:27.440
I would like us to think about how can we build a coherent world with each other?

01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:32.440
How can we make sure that this project of humanity does not end prematurely?

01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:38.440
How can we build shared agency, collective agency with each other in ways that are non-coercive

01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:44.440
and allow us to understand our relationship with reality more deeply?

01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:47.440
To me, that's the most important question.

01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:51.440
It's one where I like to collaborate with the world.

01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:55.440
I suspect that's also, to some degree, the intent of your podcast.

01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:57.440
It is, yes.

01:18:58.440 --> 01:18:59.440
Excellent.

01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:02.440
Yosha, thank you so much for your time. This was very eye-opening.

01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:07.440
I have a lot of reading to do after this, but thank you for looking forward to publishing this one.

01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:10.440
Thank you very much. Thanks for inviting me.
