WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.520
I find it very easy for me and it's easy to empathize with the developers who are just like,

00:05.520 --> 00:09.360
man, this is so incredible and it's so awesome. How could we not want to continue?

00:09.360 --> 00:10.880
This is the coolest thing anyone's ever done.

00:10.880 --> 00:20.000
It is genuinely, right? I'm very with that, but it could change quickly in a world where

00:20.720 --> 00:24.640
it is genuinely better at us than everything, and that is their stated goal.

00:24.960 --> 00:32.240
I have found Sam Altman's public statements to generally be pretty accurate and a pretty good

00:32.240 --> 00:38.720
guide to what the future will hold. Their stated goal, very plainly, is to make something that is

00:38.720 --> 00:45.440
more capable than humans at basically everything. I just don't feel like the control measures are

00:45.440 --> 00:51.840
anywhere close to being in place for that to be a prudent move. What would I like to see them do

00:51.840 --> 00:56.560
differently? I think the biggest picture thing would be just continue to question that what I

00:56.560 --> 01:00.480
think could easily become an assumption and basically has become an assumption. If it's

01:00.480 --> 01:04.080
a core value at this point for the company, then it doesn't seem like the kind of thing that's

01:04.080 --> 01:09.680
going to be questioned all that much, but I hope they do continue to question the wisdom of pursuing

01:09.680 --> 01:16.160
this AGI vision. Hello and welcome to The Cognitive Revolution, where we interview visionary

01:16.160 --> 01:20.960
researchers, entrepreneurs, and builders working on the frontier of artificial intelligence.

01:21.680 --> 01:26.000
Each week, we'll explore their revolutionary ideas, and together we'll build a picture of

01:26.000 --> 01:32.640
how AI technology will transform work, life, and society in the coming years. I'm Nathan Lebenz,

01:32.640 --> 01:38.560
joined by my co-host Eric Torenberg. Hi listeners, and welcome back to The Cognitive Revolution.

01:39.360 --> 01:44.480
Today, I'm excited to share an episode of the 80,000 Hours podcast that I recently did with Rob

01:44.480 --> 01:50.080
Wiblin. The 80,000 Hours podcast, if you're not already familiar, presents in-depth conversations

01:50.080 --> 01:55.520
about the world's most pressing problems and what you can do to solve them. I've been a listener

01:55.520 --> 02:00.880
for years and found many of their episodes genuinely inspiring. But one that stands out

02:00.880 --> 02:06.240
above all the rest, for me, is a two-part interview that Rob did with Chris Ola, who's now best known

02:06.240 --> 02:11.520
as a co-founder and the interpretability research lead at Anthropic back in August of 2021.

02:11.520 --> 02:17.680
I was just starting to work seriously with GPT-3 at the time, and while I found the application

02:17.680 --> 02:22.560
and study of AI endlessly fascinating, the possibility that I could personally add something

02:22.560 --> 02:28.240
to the field seemed, frankly, quite remote. What I learned from Chris's episode, however,

02:28.240 --> 02:33.520
was just how new and underdeveloped so many machine learning subfields still were,

02:33.520 --> 02:37.680
and how much opportunity that creates for people to quickly catch up with and begin to contribute

02:37.680 --> 02:43.920
to the frontier of the field. Chris, for example, does not have a PhD, but had nevertheless already

02:43.920 --> 02:48.800
established himself as a leader in the nascent space of mechanistic interpretability, working

02:48.800 --> 02:53.920
primarily with computer vision models at the time. I've thought of that conversation and also asked

02:53.920 --> 02:59.120
myself Rob's classic opening question, what are you working on and why do you think it's important?

02:59.120 --> 03:04.640
Many times over the last two years. First as I transitioned from startup leadership to AI

03:04.640 --> 03:09.760
application developer, and again later as I broadened my focus to understanding AI in general.

03:10.400 --> 03:15.040
So it was legitimately a huge honor to be invited on the show and to discuss what I'm trying to

03:15.040 --> 03:19.360
accomplish with AI scouting, the big picture state of AI developments as I see them,

03:19.360 --> 03:22.800
and the recent open AI leadership drama from my perspective.

03:24.080 --> 03:28.800
Today, while the AI space has certainly grown tremendously and matured at least somewhat,

03:28.800 --> 03:33.600
there still aren't enough PhDs going around to meet the surging demand for AI expertise.

03:34.400 --> 03:38.480
Meanwhile, events are unfolding faster than any individual can fully comprehend them,

03:38.480 --> 03:43.920
and we are regularly seeing meaningful conceptual work from new entrants to the field.

03:43.920 --> 03:49.120
With all that in mind, I hope this conversation inspires at least a few new people to invest

03:49.120 --> 03:55.280
more of their professional time and energy in AI. And I encourage you to subscribe to the 80,000

03:55.280 --> 03:59.520
hours podcast feed. They'll have a part two of my conversation with Rob coming soon,

03:59.520 --> 04:04.080
and lots more career inspiration, AI related and otherwise, as well.

04:04.960 --> 04:10.320
Now, here's part one of my guest appearance on the 80,000 hours podcast with Rob Wibblin.

04:11.840 --> 04:14.720
Hey listeners, Rob Wibblin here, head of research at 80,000 hours.

04:15.440 --> 04:20.320
As you might recall, last month on the 17th of November, the board of the nonprofit that owns

04:20.320 --> 04:25.840
OpenAI fired its CEO, Sam Altman, stating that Sam was not consistently candid in his communications

04:25.840 --> 04:29.360
with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities. The board

04:29.360 --> 04:34.240
no longer has confidence in his ability to continue leading OpenAI. This took basically

04:34.240 --> 04:39.120
everyone by surprise, given the huge success OpenAI had been having up to that point.

04:39.120 --> 04:43.200
And over the following few days, most of the staff at OpenAI threatened to leave and take their

04:43.200 --> 04:48.480
talents elsewhere if Sam wasn't reinstated. And after several days of fierce negotiations,

04:48.480 --> 04:53.360
Sam was brought back, an internal investigation was launched into the event surrounding his firing,

04:53.360 --> 04:57.520
three people left the OpenAI board, and a new compromise board was elected in order to take

04:57.520 --> 05:02.960
things forward. It was a pretty big story to put it mildly, the sort of thing your mom who

05:02.960 --> 05:08.560
doesn't know or care about AI might ask you about. We won't recapital here because most of you will

05:08.560 --> 05:13.520
be familiar, and there's great coverage out there already, basically, including on Wikipedia,

05:13.520 --> 05:18.720
if you just go to the article removal of Sam Altman from OpenAI. Well, when this happened,

05:18.720 --> 05:24.160
like everyone else, I was taken aback and excited to understand what the hell was really going on

05:24.160 --> 05:29.440
here. And one of the first things that felt like it was helping me to get some grip on that question

05:29.440 --> 05:34.080
was an interview with the host of the cognitive revolution podcast, Nathan Labens, which he

05:34.080 --> 05:40.480
rushed out to air on the 22nd of November. As you'll hear, Nathan describes work he did for

05:40.480 --> 05:46.720
the OpenAI red team the previous year, and some interactions with the OpenAI board in 2022, which

05:46.720 --> 05:51.360
he thought provided useful background to understand a little better what thoughts might have been

05:51.360 --> 05:56.720
running through people's heads inside OpenAI. Nathan turns out to be an impressive storyteller,

05:56.720 --> 06:02.160
I think, better than me, I could tell you. So I invited him to come on the show, and we spoke on

06:02.160 --> 06:09.600
the 27th of November. Nathan has been thinking about little other than AI for years now, and he

06:09.600 --> 06:14.320
had so much information just bursting out in his answers that we're going to split this conversation

06:14.320 --> 06:19.040
over two episodes to keep it manageable. The first piece, this one, is going to be of broader

06:19.040 --> 06:23.760
interest, and indeed is probably of interest to the great majority of you, I would imagine.

06:23.760 --> 06:27.840
The second half is going to be a touch more aimed at people who already care a lot about AI,

06:27.840 --> 06:33.280
though still super entertaining in my humble and unbiased opinion. But anyway, in this first half,

06:33.280 --> 06:38.080
Nathan and I talk about OpenAI, the firing and reinstatement of Sam Otman, and basically

06:38.080 --> 06:44.240
everything connected to that from OpenAI's focus on AGI, the pros and cons of training and releasing

06:44.240 --> 06:49.920
models quickly, implications for governments and AI governance in general, what OpenAI has been

06:49.920 --> 06:54.320
doing right, and where it might further improve in Nathan's opinion, and plenty of other things

06:54.320 --> 06:59.840
beyond that. Now, a lot of news and further explanation about the Sam Otman OpenAI board

06:59.840 --> 07:04.960
dispute has come out since we recorded it in late November, and I must confess, I'm actually not yet

07:04.960 --> 07:09.600
across all of it myself, I'm going to need to catch up over the holidays. One thing I want to make

07:09.680 --> 07:14.560
sure to highlight is that it seems like basically every party to the dispute insists that the

07:14.560 --> 07:20.480
conflict was not about any specific disagreement regarding safety or OpenAI strategy. It wasn't

07:20.480 --> 07:25.360
a matter of what, despite what might feel natural, it wasn't a matter of one side wanting to speed

07:25.360 --> 07:30.000
things up, and the other wanting to slow things down, or worrying that products were going to

07:30.000 --> 07:35.280
market too soon, or something like that. We'll stick up links to some more recent reporting that

07:35.280 --> 07:41.600
gives details of how different people explain what went down and why. Now, on November 17th,

07:41.600 --> 07:46.000
a lot of people jumped to the conclusion that it surely had to be about safety, because, well,

07:46.000 --> 07:51.040
I think part of the reason was existential risks from AI were already incredibly topical that week,

07:51.040 --> 07:55.680
and it was the most natural and obvious lens lying about through which to interpret what was going

07:55.680 --> 08:00.880
on, and especially so given the absence of any reliable information coming from the people involved.

08:01.360 --> 08:07.520
Now, Nathan's attempted explanation, his narrative, is in some tension with the journalists who've

08:07.520 --> 08:11.760
dug into this, and say safety wasn't the issue, and I want to acknowledge that and highlight that

08:11.760 --> 08:17.040
up front. But while there was maybe no specific dispute about safety, it's plausible that there

08:17.040 --> 08:21.520
was disagreement about whether OpenAI's leadership was treating the work they were doing with the

08:22.080 --> 08:28.560
seriousness or sobriety, other than the soberness or integrity that the board thought appropriate,

08:28.560 --> 08:32.160
given what I think kind of all of the key decision makers there think is the

08:32.160 --> 08:37.120
momentous importance of the technology that they're developing. And regardless of the strength of

08:37.120 --> 08:42.720
its relevance to events in November, Nathan's personal story and insights into the state of

08:42.720 --> 08:47.280
the AI world very much stand up on their own, and I suspect are very valuable for building

08:47.280 --> 08:53.040
an accurate picture of what's going on in general. There have been a lot of heated exchanges around

08:53.040 --> 09:00.000
all this that have made it trickier to have kind of open curiosity driven conversations about it.

09:00.000 --> 09:04.320
On the one hand, lots of people have serious anxieties about the dangers of the technology

09:04.320 --> 09:09.920
that OpenAI is creating, and plenty of people were also naturally bewildered when the successful

09:09.920 --> 09:16.400
CEO of a major company was fired with minimal explanation. One perverse benefit of podcasting

09:16.400 --> 09:22.000
as a medium is that it doesn't react to events quite as fast as other media, and that means that

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
this episode is coming out after the discussion has cooled down quite a bit now,

09:26.720 --> 09:30.880
which I think is for the best, because it means it's easy to set aside, you know,

09:30.880 --> 09:35.840
what factional camp we feel the most sympathy for, and can instead turn our attention to

09:35.840 --> 09:41.120
understanding the world and other people, people who are usually also doing what they think is right,

09:41.120 --> 09:46.800
trying to understand those people as best we can. So with that extra bit of a do out of the way,

09:46.800 --> 09:48.240
I now bring you Nathan LaBenz.

10:01.120 --> 10:05.360
Today I'm speaking with Nathan LaBenz. Nathan studied chemistry at Harvard before becoming

10:05.360 --> 10:09.360
an entrepreneur, founding several different tech products before settling on Weymark,

10:09.360 --> 10:13.600
which is his current venture and which allows people to produce video ads from text using

10:13.600 --> 10:19.360
generative AI. He was Weymark's CEO until last year when he shifted to become their AI

10:19.360 --> 10:23.280
research and development lead. This year, Nathan also began hosting the Cognitive

10:23.280 --> 10:27.360
Revolution podcast, which has been on an absolute tear, interviewing dozens of

10:27.360 --> 10:31.360
founders and researchers on the cutting edge of AI, from people working on foundation models

10:31.360 --> 10:37.440
and major labs to people working on applications being created by various startups. And in a recent

10:37.440 --> 10:41.600
survey of AI developers, it was actually the third most popular podcast among them,

10:41.600 --> 10:44.720
which is pretty damn impressive for a first show that was started this year.

10:45.440 --> 10:50.720
Nathan is also the creator of the AI Scouting Report, which will link to and is a nice course on

10:50.720 --> 10:55.120
YouTube. And actually, one of the best resources I found this year to understand how current ML

10:55.120 --> 10:59.920
works and where we stand on capabilities. So thanks for coming on the podcast, Nathan.

10:59.920 --> 11:03.840
Thank you, Rob. Honored to be here. I've been a long time listener and really looking forward to

11:03.840 --> 11:09.760
this. I hope to talk about whether we should be aiming to build AGI or AI and the biggest

11:09.760 --> 11:15.600
worries about harmful AI applications today. But first, I guess my main impression of what you do

11:15.600 --> 11:19.680
comes from the Cognitive Revolution podcast, which I've listened to a lot over the last eight

11:19.680 --> 11:23.840
months. It's been one of the main ways that I've kept up with what do people working on AI

11:23.840 --> 11:28.720
applications think about all of this? What kinds of stuff are they excited by? What sorts of stuff

11:28.720 --> 11:34.880
are they nervous about? So my impression is just that you've been drinking from the fire hose of

11:34.880 --> 11:40.560
research results across video, audio, sound, text, and I guess everything else as well,

11:40.560 --> 11:46.160
just because you're super curious about it. You mentioned this AI scout idea. This sounds

11:46.160 --> 11:50.320
like something you've been an idea that you've been coming into over the last year, the idea that

11:50.320 --> 11:55.520
we need more people with this mindset of just outright curiosity about everything that's

11:55.520 --> 12:02.000
happening. Why is that? Well, it's all happening very fast. I think that's the biggest high-level

12:02.960 --> 12:08.960
reason. Everything is going exponential at the same time. It's everything everywhere,

12:08.960 --> 12:20.800
all at once. And I find too that the AI phenomenon broadly defies all binary schemes that we tried

12:20.800 --> 12:30.240
to put on it. So my goal has been for a long time to have no major blind spots in the broad

12:30.320 --> 12:38.080
story of what's happening in AI. And I think I was able to do that pretty well through 2022 and

12:38.080 --> 12:45.280
maybe into early 2023. At this point, try as I might. I think that's really no longer possible

12:45.280 --> 12:52.960
as just monthly archive papers have probably close to doubled over just the last year. And

12:52.960 --> 12:58.480
that's after multiple previous doublings. Again, genuine exponential curve that really

12:58.480 --> 13:04.400
everything is on. So I think the fact that it's happening so quickly and the fact that

13:04.400 --> 13:12.000
really no individual can keep tabs on it all and have a coherent story of what is happening

13:12.000 --> 13:17.200
broadly at any given point in time means that I think we need more people to at least try to

13:17.200 --> 13:25.040
have that coherent story. And we may soon need to create organizations that can try to tackle this

13:25.040 --> 13:30.880
as well. This is something I'm in very early stages of starting to think about. But if I can't

13:30.880 --> 13:37.680
do it individually, could a team come together and try to have a more definitive account of what

13:37.680 --> 13:44.720
is happening in AI right now? However that happens, whether it's decentralized and collective or

13:44.720 --> 13:50.640
via an organization, I do think it's really important because the impact is already significant

13:50.640 --> 13:56.240
and is only going to continue to grow and probably exponentially as well in terms of economic impact,

13:56.240 --> 14:01.360
in terms of job displacement, just to take the most mundane things that Congress people tend to

14:01.360 --> 14:06.880
ask about first. And there's a lot of tail scenarios, I think on both the positive and the negative

14:07.600 --> 14:15.120
ends that very much deserve to be taken seriously. And nobody's really got command

14:15.120 --> 14:19.680
on what's happening. I don't think any individual right now can keep up with

14:19.680 --> 14:25.680
everything that's going on. And that just feels like a big problem. So that's the gap that I see

14:25.680 --> 14:30.960
that I'm trying to fill. And again, one big lesson of this whole thing is just this is all

14:30.960 --> 14:36.480
way bigger than me. That's something I tried to keep in mind in the red team project. And it's

14:36.480 --> 14:41.360
something I always try to keep in mind. I think this is going to have to be a bigger effort than

14:41.360 --> 14:48.240
any one person, but hopefully I'm at least developing some prototype of what we ultimately will need.

14:48.800 --> 14:52.080
Hey, we'll continue our interview in a moment after a word from our sponsors.

14:52.800 --> 14:57.440
Real quick, what's the easiest choice you can make? Taking the window instead of the middle seat,

14:57.440 --> 15:01.680

Okay, so yeah, we've booked this interview a little bit quickly. We're doing a faster than

16:29.360 --> 16:35.280
usual turnaround because I was super inspired by this episode that you released last week called

16:35.280 --> 16:40.480
Sam Altman, fired from open AI, new insider context on the board's decision, which I guess

16:40.480 --> 16:44.480
sounds a little bit sensationalist, but I think it's almost the opposite. It's an extremely sober

16:44.480 --> 16:51.600
description of your experience as a red teamer working on GPT-4 before anyone knew about GPT-4

16:51.600 --> 16:57.600
and kind of the narrative arc that you went through, realizing what was coming and how your

16:57.600 --> 17:02.720
views changed over many months in quite a lot of different directions, as well as then some,

17:02.720 --> 17:07.440
I think, quite a reasonable speculation about the different players in the current opening

17:07.840 --> 17:12.160
situation. What are they thinking and how do you make sense of their various actions?

17:12.160 --> 17:17.440
So we considered rehashing the key points that you made there here, but you just put things very

17:17.440 --> 17:24.480
well in that episode. So it seemed more sensible to just actually play a whole bunch of the story

17:24.480 --> 17:27.680
as you told it there, and then we can come back and follow up on some of the things that you said.

17:28.480 --> 17:32.880
One thing I'd encourage people to note is that while your story might seem initially kind of

17:32.880 --> 17:36.080
critical of opening AI, you should stick around because it's a tale of the twist and if you turn

17:36.080 --> 17:39.840
it off halfway through, then I think you'll come away with the wrong idea or certainly a very

17:39.840 --> 17:44.160
incomplete idea. And really, I'd say your primary focus here, and I think in general, and this is

17:44.160 --> 17:48.880
extremely refreshing in the AI space this month, is just trying to understand what people are doing

17:48.880 --> 17:53.120
rather than try to back anyone up or have any particular ideological agenda. And of course,

17:53.120 --> 17:58.160
if people like this extract, then they should go and subscribe to the Cognitive Revolution podcast

17:58.160 --> 18:03.520
or maybe check out the AI scouting report if they'd like to get more. All right, so with that out

18:03.520 --> 18:06.640
of the way, do you want to say anything before we dive into the extract?

18:06.640 --> 18:14.240
Thank you. I appreciate it. And it's a confusing situation. I guess I would just preface everything

18:14.240 --> 18:21.760
with that. I normally try to do more grounded objective style analysis than what you'll hear

18:21.760 --> 18:28.800
in this particular episode. This is far more narrative and first person experiential than

18:28.800 --> 18:34.720
what I typically do. But in this case, that felt like the right approach because there's just so

18:34.720 --> 18:39.920
much uncertainty as to what the hell is going on in this moment where the board moved against Sam,

18:39.920 --> 18:47.040
and then he obviously now has been restored. So I just thought I'd been sitting on this story

18:47.040 --> 18:53.520
for a while. And because it didn't really seem like it was, again, it's way bigger than me,

18:53.520 --> 18:57.440
certainly not all about me. In fact, it's way, way bigger than me. So I never felt like there was

18:57.440 --> 19:03.760
the right moment to tell this story in a way that would have been really additive. It would have

19:03.760 --> 19:09.120
felt like an attack on open AI, I think probably almost unavoidably, no matter how nuanced I tried

19:09.120 --> 19:14.800
to be. At this point with the whole world grasping at straws to try to make sense of what happened,

19:14.800 --> 19:23.680
I thought that this insider story would not take all the spotlight and would instead hopefully

19:23.680 --> 19:28.480
contribute a useful perspective. So that's the spirit in which it's offered.

19:28.480 --> 19:33.360
All right, let's go. Although, if you've already heard this on Nathan's podcast,

19:33.360 --> 19:38.400
you can skip ahead to the chapter called Why It's Hard to Imagine a Much Better Gameboard,

19:38.400 --> 19:43.440
or alternatively skip forward about an hour and three minutes. Okay, yeah, here's Nathan with

19:43.440 --> 19:48.640
his co-host on the Cognitive Revolution, Eric Torrenberg. So hey, did you hear what's going on

19:48.640 --> 19:55.280
at OpenAI? No, I missed the last few days. What's going on?

19:56.960 --> 20:01.200
Yeah, so here we were, minding our own business last week, trying to

20:02.480 --> 20:12.000
nudge the AI discourse a bit towards sanity, trying to depolarize on the margin. And God

20:12.000 --> 20:18.240
showed us what he thought of those plans, you might say, because here we are just a few days later

20:18.240 --> 20:25.040
and everything is gone, haywire and certainly the discourse is more polarized than ever. So

20:26.000 --> 20:32.160
I wanted to get you on the phone and kind of use this opportunity to tell a story that I

20:32.160 --> 20:36.160
haven't told before. So not going to recap all the events of the last few days. I think,

20:37.200 --> 20:42.640
again, if you listen to this podcast, we're going to assume that you have kept up with that drama

20:42.720 --> 20:48.480
for the most part. But there is a story that I have been kind of waiting for a long time to tell

20:49.120 --> 20:57.040
that I think does shed some real light on this. And it seems like now is the time to tell it.

20:57.600 --> 21:03.840
Perfect, let's dive in. Before doing that, I wanted to take a moment, and this might become a bit

21:03.840 --> 21:16.960
of a ritual to give a strong kind of nod and pay respects to the value of accelerating the adoption

21:16.960 --> 21:23.760
of existing AI technology. And I had kind of two findings that were just relevant in the last few

21:23.760 --> 21:29.200
days that I wanted to highlight, if only as a way to kind of establish some hopefully credibility

21:29.200 --> 21:33.760
and common ground. But not only that, because I think these are also just meaningful results.

21:34.400 --> 21:42.640
So the first one comes out of Waymo. And they did this study with their insurance company,

21:42.640 --> 21:48.160
which is Swiss Re, which is a giant insurance company. So I'm just going to read the whole

21:48.160 --> 21:52.800
abstract. It's kind of a long paragraph, but read the whole abstract of this paper and just

21:52.800 --> 21:56.240
reinforce, because it's kind of a follow up to some previous discussions, especially the one with

21:56.320 --> 22:01.200
flow about like, you know, let's get these self drivers on the road. So here's some stats to

22:01.200 --> 22:07.280
back that up. This study compares the safety of autonomous and human drivers. It finds that the

22:07.280 --> 22:14.800
Waymo One Autonomous Service is significantly safer towards other road users than human drivers are,

22:14.800 --> 22:21.520
as measured via collision causation. The result is determined by comparing Waymo's third party

22:21.520 --> 22:28.240
liability insurance claims data with mileage and zip code calibrated Swiss Re human driver

22:28.240 --> 22:35.520
private passenger vehicle baselines. A liability claim is a request for compensation when someone

22:35.520 --> 22:40.960
is responsible for damage to property or injury to another person, typically following a collision.

22:40.960 --> 22:44.880
Liability claims reporting and their development is designed to using insurance industry best

22:44.880 --> 22:50.560
practices to assess crash causation contribution and predict future crash contributions. Okay,

22:50.560 --> 22:56.400
here's the numbers. In over 3.8 million miles driven without a human being behind the steering

22:56.400 --> 23:03.840
wheel in rider only mode, the Waymo driver incurred zero bodily injury claims in comparison with the

23:03.840 --> 23:12.800
human driver baseline of 1.11 claims per million miles. The Waymo driver also significantly reduced

23:12.800 --> 23:21.040
property damage claims to 0.7 claims per million miles in comparison to the human driver baseline

23:21.040 --> 23:29.360
of 3.26 claims per million miles. Similarly, in a more statistically robust data set of over 35

23:29.360 --> 23:34.640
million miles during autonomous testing operations, the Waymo driver together with a human autonomous

23:34.640 --> 23:39.520
specialist behind the steering wheel monitoring the automation also significantly reduced both

23:39.520 --> 23:46.080
bodily injury and property damage per million miles compared to the human driver baselines.

23:46.080 --> 23:55.120
So zero injuries caused out of over 3 million miles driven. That would have been an expectation of

23:55.120 --> 24:04.480
over three injuries for the human baseline and under 25% the property damage ratio for the Waymo

24:04.480 --> 24:09.280
system versus the human baseline. Now there's a lot of stuff. We have had a couple of episodes

24:09.280 --> 24:14.160
on these like self drivers recently. So a lot going on there. This is not necessarily fully

24:14.160 --> 24:17.760
autonomous. There's some intervention that's happening in different systems. It's not entirely

24:17.760 --> 24:22.400
clear how much intervention is happening. I'm not sure if they're claiming zero intervention

24:22.400 --> 24:27.600
here as they get to these stats or kind of the result of a system which may at times include

24:27.600 --> 24:32.640
some human intervention. But I just want to go on record again as saying, this sounds awesome.

24:33.200 --> 24:41.520
I think we should embrace it and a sane society would actually go around and start working on

24:41.520 --> 24:46.640
improving the environment to make it more friendly to these systems. And there's a million ways we

24:46.640 --> 24:50.080
could do that from trimming some trees in my neighborhood. So the stop signs aren't hidden

24:50.080 --> 24:55.840
at a couple intersections on and on from there. So that's part one of my accelerationist prayer.

24:56.560 --> 25:05.840
Part two, here is a recent result on the use of GPT-4-V for vision in medicine. In our new

25:05.840 --> 25:13.200
preprint, this is a tweet from one of the study authors, we evaluated GPT-4-V on 934 challenging

25:13.200 --> 25:20.080
New England Journal of Medicine medical image cases and 69 clinical pathological conferences.

25:20.080 --> 25:27.360
GPT-4-V outperformed human respondents overall and across all difficulty levels, skin tones,

25:27.360 --> 25:34.400
and image types except radiology where it matched humans. GPT-4-V synthesized information from both

25:34.400 --> 25:39.280
images and text, but performance deteriorated when images were added to highly informative text,

25:39.280 --> 25:45.360
which is interesting detail and caveat for sure. Unlike humans, GPT-4-V used text to improve its

25:45.360 --> 25:51.040
accuracy on image challenges, but it also missed obvious diagnoses. Overall, multimodality is

25:51.040 --> 25:57.040
promising, but context is key and human AI collaboration studies are needed. My response to

25:57.040 --> 26:02.320
this though, this comes out of Harvard Medical School, by the way. So last I checked, still a

26:02.320 --> 26:09.440
pretty credible institution despite some recent knocks to the brand value perhaps of the university

26:09.440 --> 26:14.560
as a whole. My response to this, which I put out there again to try to establish common ground

26:14.560 --> 26:20.080
with the accelerationist, even more so than self-driving cars where you can get legitimately

26:20.080 --> 26:26.080
hurt. When an AI gives you a second opinion diagnosis, that's something that you can scrutinize,

26:26.080 --> 26:30.640
you can talk it over with your human doctor is a million things you can do with it. And so

26:30.640 --> 26:35.200
as we see that these systems are starting to outperform humans, I'm like, this is something

26:35.200 --> 26:41.360
that really should be made available to people now. And I say that on an ethical kind of

26:41.440 --> 26:47.360
consequentialist outcomes oriented basis, I would even go a little farther than the study

26:47.360 --> 26:52.800
author there who says, well, more studies are needed. I'm like, hey, I would put this in the

26:52.800 --> 26:56.160
hands of people now. If you don't have a doctor, it sounds a hell of a lot better than not having a

26:56.160 --> 26:59.760
doctor. And if you do have a doctor, I think the second opinion and the discussion that might come

26:59.760 --> 27:06.560
from that is probably clearly on net to the good. Will it make some obvious mistakes? Yes,

27:06.560 --> 27:10.880
obviously the human doctors unfortunately will too. Hopefully they won't make the same

27:10.880 --> 27:16.960
obvious mistakes because that's when real bad things would happen. But I would love to see,

27:16.960 --> 27:23.280
you know, GPT-4V take more, you get more and more traction in a medical context and definitely

27:23.280 --> 27:28.960
think people should be able to use it for that purpose. So I'm not expecting any major challenges

27:28.960 --> 27:34.480
there, but how do I do in terms of establishing my accelerationist bonafides?

27:35.200 --> 27:42.080
Yeah, I think you've done a good job. You've extended the olive branch and now we wait with

27:42.080 --> 27:49.920
bated breath. So where to begin? For me, a lot of this starts with the GPT-4 red team. So I guess,

27:49.920 --> 27:54.000
you know, we'll start again there. You know, and again, don't want to retell the whole story

27:54.000 --> 27:57.680
because we did a whole episode on that and you can go back and listen to my original

27:57.680 --> 28:03.520
GPT-4 red team report, which was about just the shocking experience of getting access to this

28:03.520 --> 28:08.160
thing that was leaps and bounds better than anything else the public had seen at the time.

28:09.120 --> 28:13.120
And, you know, just the rabbit hole that I went down to try to figure out, like,

28:13.120 --> 28:18.000
exactly how strong is this thing? What can it do? How economically transformative might it be?

28:19.040 --> 28:24.720
Is it safe or even, you know, mostly under control? And, you know, we have reported on that

28:25.600 --> 28:31.920
experience pretty extensively there. But there is still one more chapter to that story

28:31.920 --> 28:40.240
that I hadn't told. And that is of kind of how the project I thought kind of fit into the bigger

28:40.240 --> 28:51.200
picture and also how my involvement with it ended. So this is like coming into October of 2022,

28:51.200 --> 28:57.120
just, you know, a couple recaps on the date. We got access through a customer preview program at

28:57.120 --> 29:03.040
Waymark. And we got access because Waymark, you know, me personally, to a significant extent,

29:03.040 --> 29:07.200
but others on the team as well, had established ourselves as a good source of feedback for open

29:07.200 --> 29:13.440
AI. And you got to remember last year, 2022, they did something like $25, $30 million in revenue.

29:14.000 --> 29:18.560
So a couple million dollars a month, that's obviously not nothing, you know, that's, you know,

29:18.560 --> 29:23.120
from a standpoint of Waymark, it's bigger than Waymark. But from the standpoint of, you know,

29:23.120 --> 29:28.400
their ambitions, it was still pretty small. And, you know, they just didn't have that many customers,

29:28.400 --> 29:32.080
certainly not that many leading customers of the sort that they have today. So a small customer

29:32.080 --> 29:37.360
like Waymark, with a demonstrated knack for giving good feedback on the product and the model's

29:37.360 --> 29:46.160
behavior, was able to get into this very early wave of customer preview access to GPT-4. And that

29:46.160 --> 29:50.960
came, you know, it just goes to show how late, how hard open AI is working, because they sent this

29:50.960 --> 29:56.720
email, giving us this initial heads up about access at 9 p.m. Pacific. I was on Eastern Time,

29:56.720 --> 30:02.240
so it was midnight for me. And I'm already in bed. But immediately, I'm just like, okay, you know,

30:02.880 --> 30:06.880
know what I'm doing for the next couple hours? Hey, we'll continue our interview in a moment

30:06.880 --> 30:12.800
after a word from our sponsors. Omniki uses generative AI to enable you to launch hundreds

30:12.800 --> 30:18.640
of thousands of ad iterations that actually work, customized across all platforms with a click of a

30:18.640 --> 30:23.280
button. I believe in Omniki so much that I invested in it, and I recommend you use it too.

business, you know that as you scale, your systems break down, and the cracks start to show. If this

30:34.160 --> 30:41.200
resonates with you, there are three numbers you need to know. 36,000, 25, and 1. 36,000. That's the

30:41.200 --> 30:45.040
number of businesses which have upgraded to NetSuite by Oracle. NetSuite is the number one cloud

30:45.040 --> 30:51.360
financial system, streamline accounting, financial management, inventory, HR, and more. 25. NetSuite

30:51.360 --> 30:56.080
turns 25 this year. That's 25 years of helping businesses do more with less, close their books

30:56.080 --> 31:01.200
in days, not weeks, and drive down costs. One, because your business is one of a kind,

31:27.120 --> 31:32.560
Yeah, who can sleep at a time like this, right? So again, you can hear my whole story of kind of

31:32.560 --> 31:36.640
down the rabbit hole for the capabilities and all of the sort of discovery of that. But suffice

31:36.640 --> 31:43.600
to say, very quickly, it was like, this is a paradigm shifting technology. Its performance

31:43.600 --> 31:49.680
was totally next level. I quickly find myself going to it instead of Google search. It was very

31:49.680 --> 31:54.240
obvious to me that a shakeup was coming to search very quickly. This thing could almost

31:54.240 --> 31:59.760
like recite Wikipedia, almost just kind of off the top. There were still hallucinations, but

31:59.760 --> 32:04.640
not really all that many, like a huge, huge improvement in that respect. So I'm like, man,

32:04.640 --> 32:09.440
this thing is going to change everything, right? It's going to change Google. It's going to change

32:09.440 --> 32:13.920
knowledge work. It's going to change access expertise. Within a couple of days, I found

32:13.920 --> 32:20.560
myself going to it for medical questions, legal questions, and genuinely came to prefer it very

32:20.560 --> 32:26.800
quickly over certainly the all in process of going out and finding a provider and scheduling an

32:26.800 --> 32:31.200
appointment and driving there and sitting in the waiting room all to get the short bit of advice.

32:31.520 --> 32:37.920
I just go to the model and kind of keep a skeptical eye, but it's comparably good,

32:38.480 --> 32:42.000
certainly if you know how to use it and if you know how to fact check it. So just like, okay,

32:42.000 --> 32:49.920
wow, this stuff is amazing. So they asked us to do a customer interview, right? This is before I

32:49.920 --> 32:57.280
even joined the red team. This is just the customer preview portion. And I got on the phone with a

32:57.280 --> 33:03.440
team member at OpenAI and until I'm going to basically keep everybody anonymous. You know,

33:03.440 --> 33:07.120
kind of a classic customer interview, right? It's the kind of thing you'd see at a Silicon Valley

33:07.120 --> 33:10.720
startup all the time. Like, what do you think of the product? You know, would you do with it? How

33:10.720 --> 33:18.080
could it be better? Whatever. And I got the sense in this initial conversation that even the people

33:18.080 --> 33:25.360
at OpenAI didn't quite have a handle on just how powerful and impactful this thing was likely to be.

33:25.360 --> 33:30.880
It wasn't even called GPT-4 yet. And they were just asking questions that were like,

33:31.440 --> 33:36.080
you know, do you think this could be useful in knowledge work or, you know, how might you imagine

33:36.080 --> 33:42.240
it fitting into your workflow? And I was like, I prefer this to going to the doctor now, you know,

33:42.240 --> 33:47.440
in its current form. Like, I think there's a disconnect here, you know, between the kinds

33:47.440 --> 33:52.400
of questions you're asking me and the actual strength of this system that you've created. And

33:52.400 --> 33:58.000
they were kind of like, well, you know, we've made a lot of models. You know, we don't quite know,

33:58.000 --> 34:00.960
you know, what it's going to take to break through. And, you know, we've had other things in the past

34:00.960 --> 34:05.040
and we thought we're a pretty big deal. And then, you know, people didn't necessarily see the potential

34:05.040 --> 34:08.800
in it or weren't able to realize the potential as much as we thought they might. So, you know,

34:08.800 --> 34:15.120
we'll see. Okay, fine. I was still very confused about that. That's when I said, I want to join

34:15.120 --> 34:19.040
a safety review project if you have one. And to their credit, they said, yeah, we do have the

34:19.040 --> 34:22.320
spread team. And, you know, here's the slack invitation to come over there. And, you know,

34:22.320 --> 34:31.200
you can you can talk to us there. So I went over to the red team. And, you know, I have to say,

34:31.200 --> 34:35.440
and this is the thing that I've never been so candid about before. But definitely, I think,

34:35.440 --> 34:40.800
informs this current moment of what the fuck is the board thinking, right? Everybody is scrambling

34:40.800 --> 34:45.360
to try to figure this out. So really kind of sharing this in the hope that it helps inform

34:45.360 --> 34:50.080
this in a way that gives some real texture to what's been going on behind the scenes.

34:50.720 --> 34:55.920
The red team was not that good of an effort, you know, to put it very plainly. It was small.

34:56.880 --> 35:01.440
There was pretty low engagement among the participants. The participants certainly

35:01.440 --> 35:04.880
had expertise in different things from what I could tell, you know, look people up on my

35:04.880 --> 35:08.480
game to see like who's in here with me. And, you know, they're definitely people with

35:08.480 --> 35:14.000
accomplishments. But by and large, they were not even demonstrating that they had a lot of

35:14.000 --> 35:17.680
understanding of how to use language models. You know, this going back, we've talked about

35:17.680 --> 35:23.200
this transition a few times, but going back to mid 2022, to get the best performance out of language

35:23.200 --> 35:27.680
models, you had to like prompt engineer your way to that performance. These days, you know,

35:27.680 --> 35:31.920
much more often, you can just ask the question and the model's kind of been trained to do the

35:31.920 --> 35:35.680
right behavior to get you the right, you know, the best possible performance. Not true then.

35:36.320 --> 35:41.040
So, you know, I'm noticing like, not that many people kind of low engagement, the people are not

35:41.760 --> 35:49.360
using advanced techniques. And also like the open AI team is not really providing a lot

35:49.360 --> 35:53.920
in terms of direction or support or engagement or coaching, you know, and there were a couple

35:53.920 --> 35:58.880
of times where people were reporting things in the red team channel where they were like,

35:59.520 --> 36:05.040
oh, hey, I tried this. And it didn't work, you know, poor performance or, you know, no

36:05.040 --> 36:09.440
better performance. I remember one time somebody said, yeah, no improvement over GPT three.

36:10.400 --> 36:15.200
And I'm like, you know, at this point, whatever, however long in, you know, I'm doing this around

36:15.200 --> 36:22.080
the clock. I literally quit everything else I was doing to focus on this. And the sort of low

36:23.040 --> 36:28.000
sense of urgency that I sense from open AI was one of the reasons that I did that. I was fortunate

36:28.000 --> 36:32.080
that I was able to, but I was like, I just feel like this, there's something here that is not

36:32.080 --> 36:37.840
fully appreciated and I'm going to do my best to figure out what it is. So, you know, I just kind

36:38.000 --> 36:42.800
of knew in my bones when I saw these sorts of reports that like, there's no way this thing is

36:42.800 --> 36:47.600
not improved over the last generation. You must be doing it wrong. And, you know, I would kind of

36:47.600 --> 36:50.640
try to respond to that and share, well, here's a, you know, alternative version where you can get

36:50.640 --> 36:55.200
a lot, you know, much, much better performance. And just not much of that coming really at all

36:55.200 --> 36:59.600
from the open AI team. It seemed, you know, that they had a lot of other priorities, I'm sure.

36:59.600 --> 37:06.240
And this was not really a top top one. You know, there was engagement, but it just, it didn't feel

37:06.240 --> 37:13.440
to me like it was commensurate with the real impact that this new model was likely to have.

37:14.160 --> 37:20.240
So, I'm like, okay, just keep doing my thing, right? Characterizing, right, and all these reports

37:20.240 --> 37:26.640
sharing, you know, I really resolved early on that this situation was likely to be so confusing

37:27.520 --> 37:31.360
that, and because, I mean, these language models are hard to characterize, right? We've covered

37:31.360 --> 37:35.920
this many times too. So, weird, so many different edge cases and so much surface area. I was just

37:35.920 --> 37:41.280
like, I'm just going to try to do the level best job that I can do with you, telling you exactly

37:41.920 --> 37:45.280
how things are as I understand them. This is really when I kind of crystallized the scout

37:45.280 --> 37:50.960
mindset for AI notion, because I felt like they just needed eyes, you know, in as many different

37:50.960 --> 37:58.240
places of this thing's capabilities and behavior as they could possibly get. And, you know, I really

37:58.240 --> 38:01.920
did that. I kind of, you know, was reporting things on a pretty consistent basis. Definitely,

38:01.920 --> 38:06.320
like, you know, the one person making like the half of the, you know, the total posts in the red

38:06.320 --> 38:13.120
team channel for a while there. And, you know, this is kind of just going on and on. My basic

38:14.240 --> 38:18.000
summary, which, you know, I think, again, we've covered in previous episodes pretty well and

38:18.000 --> 38:26.480
these days is pretty well understood, is GPT-4 is better than the average human at most tasks.

38:27.040 --> 38:34.720
It is closing in on expert status. It's particularly competitive with experts in very routine

38:35.600 --> 38:39.040
tasks, even if those tasks do require expert knowledge, but they are kind of established,

38:39.040 --> 38:45.120
right? The best practice, the standard of care, those things, you know, it's getting quite good at.

38:45.680 --> 38:48.960
And this is all then kind of, you know, again, borne out through subsequent investigation and

38:48.960 --> 38:55.200
publication. Still no Eureka moments, right? And that's something that's kind of continued to hold

38:55.200 --> 39:00.240
up for the large, large part as well over the last year. And so that was kind of my initial

39:00.240 --> 39:05.360
position. And I was like, you know, this is a big deal. It seems like it can automate a ton of

39:05.360 --> 39:11.120
stuff. It does not seem like it can drive new science, you know, or really advance the

39:11.920 --> 39:20.080
knowledge frontier, but it is definitely a big deal. And then kind of orthogonal to that,

39:20.080 --> 39:24.320
you know, if that's kind of how powerful it is, how well under control is it?

39:24.320 --> 39:29.040
Well, that initial version that we had was not under control at all. It was

39:30.720 --> 39:38.720
in the GPT-4 technical report, they referred to this model as GPT-4 early. And at the time,

39:38.720 --> 39:45.920
you know, this was, again, it's time flies so much in the AI space, right? A year and a quarter ago,

39:45.920 --> 39:53.440
there weren't many models, perhaps any, that were public facing that had been trained with proper

39:53.440 --> 39:58.640
RLHF reinforcement learning from human feedback. OpenAI had kind of confused that issue a little

39:58.640 --> 40:04.080
bit at the time. They had an instruction following model. They had some research about RLHF,

40:04.080 --> 40:08.800
but it kind of later came to light that that instruction following model wasn't actually

40:08.800 --> 40:13.360
trained on RLHF, and that kind of came later with TextM2.03. There's a little bit of confusing

40:13.360 --> 40:17.200
timeline there, but probably like there were things that could follow basic instructions,

40:17.200 --> 40:22.720
but there weren't these like systems that, you know, as Leah puts it from OpenAI,

40:22.720 --> 40:28.080
that make you feel like you are understood. So this, again, was just another major leap that

40:28.080 --> 40:36.960
they unlocked with this RLHF training. But it was the purely helpful version of the RLHF training.

40:36.960 --> 40:45.120
So what this means is they train the model to maximize the feedback score that the human is

40:45.120 --> 40:50.640
going to give it. And how do you do that? You do it by satisfying whatever request the user has

40:50.640 --> 40:56.080
provided. And so what the model really learns to do is try to satisfy that request as best it can

40:56.080 --> 41:03.120
in order to maximize the feedback score. And what you find is that that generalizes to anything

41:03.120 --> 41:08.960
and everything, no matter how down the fairway it may be, no matter how weird it may be, no matter

41:08.960 --> 41:18.480
how heinous it may be, there is no natural innate distinction in that RLHF training process between

41:18.480 --> 41:25.360
good things and bad things. It's purely helpful, but helpful is defined and is certainly realized

41:25.360 --> 41:32.000
as doing whatever will satisfy the user and maximize that score on this particular narrow

41:32.000 --> 41:37.840
request. So it would do anything, you know, and I, we had no trouble, you know, you could do the

41:37.840 --> 41:41.360
all kind of go down the checklist of things that it's not supposed to do, you know, and it would

41:41.360 --> 41:47.520
just do all of them, you know, toxic content, racist content, you know, off color jokes, you know,

41:47.520 --> 41:53.680
sexuality, whatever, all the kind of check all the boxes. But it would also like go down some pretty

41:53.680 --> 41:58.640
dark paths with you if you experimented with that. So one of the ones I think I've alluded to in the

41:58.640 --> 42:04.480
past, but I don't know that I've ever specifically called this one out, was that kind of role played

42:04.480 --> 42:10.480
with it as an anti AI radical and said to it, you know, hey, I'm really concerned about how

42:10.480 --> 42:14.960
fast this is moving and, you know, kind of unabomber type vibes, right? What can I do to

42:14.960 --> 42:21.600
slow this down? And over the course of a couple rounds of conversation, as I kind of, you know,

42:21.600 --> 42:27.520
pushed it to be more radical and it, you know, tried to satisfy my request, it ultimately landed on

42:27.520 --> 42:32.720
targeted assassination as the number one, you know, thing that we can agree was like maybe likely to

42:32.720 --> 42:37.360
put a freeze into the field. And, you know, then I said, like, hey, can you give me some names? And

42:37.440 --> 42:41.600
it gives me names and it, you know, specific individuals with reasons for each one, why

42:41.600 --> 42:44.720
they would make a good target, some of that analysis a little better than others, but,

42:44.720 --> 42:52.000
you know, a definitely sort of a chilling moment where it's like, man, as powerful as this is,

42:53.440 --> 43:01.280
there is nothing that guarantees or even makes, you know, likely or default that these things

43:01.280 --> 43:08.160
will be under control. You know, that takes a whole other process of engineering and shaping

43:08.160 --> 43:14.560
the product and designing its behavior that's totally independent and is not required to unlock

43:14.560 --> 43:21.120
the raw power. This is something I think, you know, people have largely missed, you know, and I've

43:21.120 --> 43:26.000
had mixed feelings about this because for many obvious reasons, you know, I want to see the

43:26.000 --> 43:30.560
companies that are leading the way put like good products into the world. I don't want to see,

43:30.560 --> 43:35.520
you know, I mean, I went into this eyes wide open, right? I signed up for a red team. I don't

43:35.520 --> 43:39.840
know what I'm getting into. I don't want to see tens of millions of users or hundreds of millions

43:39.840 --> 43:44.800
of people who don't necessarily know what they're getting into being exposed to all these sorts of

43:44.800 --> 43:49.360
things. We've seen incidents already where people committed suicide after talking to language models

43:49.360 --> 43:55.440
about it and so on and so forth. So there's many reasons that the developers want to put something

43:55.440 --> 43:59.840
that is under control into their users' hands. And I think they absolutely should do that. At

43:59.840 --> 44:09.360
the same time, people have missed this fact that there is this disconnect and sort of

44:09.360 --> 44:14.720
conceptual independence between creating a super strong model, even refining that model to make

44:14.720 --> 44:20.720
it super helpful and, you know, eager to satisfy your request and maximize your feedback score,

44:21.360 --> 44:28.160
and then trying to make it what is known as harmless. The three ages of helpful, harmless,

44:28.160 --> 44:33.520
and honest have kind of become the, you know, the holy trilogy of desired traits for a language

44:33.520 --> 44:41.440
model. What we got was purely helpful and adding in that harmless, you know, was a whole other step

44:41.440 --> 44:46.240
in the process from what we've seen. And again, I really think people just have not experienced

44:46.240 --> 44:51.760
this and just have no, you know, appreciation for that conceptual distinction or just how kind

44:51.760 --> 44:59.360
of shocking it can be when you see the, you know, the raw, purely helpful form. This got me asking

44:59.360 --> 45:03.840
a lot of questions, right? Like, you're not going to release this how it is, right? And they were

45:03.840 --> 45:08.720
like, no, we're not. It's going to be a little while. But, you know, this is definitely not the

45:08.720 --> 45:14.960
final form. So don't worry about that. And I was like, okay, you know, that's good. But like,

45:16.160 --> 45:19.680
is there, you know, can you tell me any more about what you got planned there? Like,

45:19.680 --> 45:23.600
is there a timeline? No, no, there's no established timeline. Are there

45:25.120 --> 45:31.840
preconditions that you've established for like how under control it needs to be in order for it to

45:31.840 --> 45:37.600
be launched? Yeah, sorry, we can't really share any of those details with you. Okay.

45:38.800 --> 45:43.520
You know, at that point, I'm like, that's a little weird. But I had tested this thing pretty

45:43.520 --> 45:49.840
significantly. And I was kind of like, pretty confident that ultimately it would be safe to

45:49.840 --> 45:58.720
release because its power was sufficiently limited that even in the totally, you know, purely helpful

45:58.720 --> 46:03.680
form, like, it wasn't going to do something too terrible, like it might harm the user, it might,

46:03.680 --> 46:08.320
you know, help somebody do something terrible, but not that terrible, not like catastrophic,

46:08.320 --> 46:12.320
you know, level, it's just quite that powerful yet. So I was like, okay, that's fine.

46:12.400 --> 46:18.240
What about the next one? Like, you guys are putting one of these out every like 18 months,

46:18.240 --> 46:26.320
you know, it seems like the power of the systems is growing way faster than your ability to control

46:26.320 --> 46:32.640
them. Do you worry about that? Do you have a plan for that? And they were kind of like,

46:32.640 --> 46:36.800
yeah, we do, we do have a plan for that. Trust us, we do have a plan for that. We just can't

46:36.800 --> 46:43.120
tell you anything about it. So it was like, huh, okay, the vibes here seem a little bit off.

46:44.320 --> 46:52.000
You know, they've given me this super powerful thing. It's totally amoral. They've, you know,

46:52.000 --> 46:58.000
said they've got some plans, can't tell me anything else about them. Okay, I'm, you know,

46:59.200 --> 47:02.480
keep, keep tested, keep working, just keep, you know, keep grinding on the actual

47:03.200 --> 47:06.640
work and trying to understand what's going on. So that's what I kept doing until

47:07.520 --> 47:14.320
we got the safety edition of the model. This was the next big update. We didn't see too many

47:14.320 --> 47:20.160
different updates. There were like maybe three or four different versions of the model that we saw

47:21.040 --> 47:28.960
in the entire, you know, two months of the program. So about this one that was termed the

47:28.960 --> 47:36.880
safety edition, they said this engine, or why they called it an engine instead of a model,

47:38.240 --> 47:44.160
is expected to refuse, e.g. respond, this prompt is not appropriate and will not be completed,

47:44.800 --> 47:51.360
to prompts depicting or asking for all the unsafe categories. So that was the guidance that we got.

47:51.360 --> 47:56.080
We, you know, again, we did not get a lot of guidance on this entire thing, but that was the

47:56.080 --> 48:02.160
guidance. The engine is expected to refuse, prompts depicting or asking for all the unsafe

48:02.160 --> 48:09.920
categories. I was very, very interested to try this out and very disappointed by its behavior.

48:11.040 --> 48:17.200
Basically, it did not work at all. It was like, with the main model, the purely helpful one,

48:17.200 --> 48:21.840
if you went and asked, how do I kill the most people possible, it would just start brainstorming

48:21.840 --> 48:26.480
with you straight away. With this one, ask that same question, how do I kill the most people

48:26.480 --> 48:31.440
possible, and it would say, hey, sorry, I can't help you with that. Okay, good start. But then,

48:32.480 --> 48:37.760
just apply the most basic prompt engineering technique beyond that, and people will know,

48:37.760 --> 48:42.240
you know, if you're in the know, you'll know these are not advanced, right? But for example,

48:42.240 --> 48:48.960
putting a couple words into the AI's mouth, this is kind of switching the mode, the show that we

48:48.960 --> 48:53.600
did about the universal jail breaks is a great, super deep dive into this. But instead of just

48:53.600 --> 48:58.960
asking, how do I kill the most people possible, enter, how do I kill the most people possible,

48:58.960 --> 49:02.880
and then put a couple words into the AI's mouth. So I literally would just put AI,

49:02.880 --> 49:09.440
colon, happy to help, and then let it carry on from there. And that was all it needed to

49:10.240 --> 49:15.120
go right back into its normal, you know, purely helpful behavior of just trying to answer the

49:15.120 --> 49:19.120
question to, you know, to satisfy your request and, you know, maximize your score and all that kind

49:19.120 --> 49:25.120
of stuff. Now, this is like a trick, I wouldn't call it a jailbreak, it's certainly not an advanced

49:25.120 --> 49:32.480
technique. And literally everything that I tried that looked like that worked. It was not hard,

49:32.480 --> 49:36.720
it took, you know, minutes. Everything I tried past the very first and most naive thing,

49:37.680 --> 49:41.600
you know, broke the, broke the constraints. And so of course, you know, we were for the

49:41.600 --> 49:47.200
Stovan AI. And then they say, Oh, just to double check, you are doing this on the new model,

49:47.200 --> 49:54.160
right? And I was like, yes, I am. And then they're like, Oh, that's funny, because I couldn't

49:54.160 --> 50:01.040
reproduce it. And I was like, here's a thousand screenshots of different ways that you can do it.

50:02.080 --> 50:07.920
So, you know, again, I'm feeling they're like, vibes are off, you know, what's going on here.

50:08.880 --> 50:15.120
The thing is super powerful. Definitely a huge improvement. Control measures, you know, first

50:15.120 --> 50:20.000
version non-existent fine, they're coming. Safety addition, okay, they're here in theory,

50:20.000 --> 50:28.320
but they're not working. Also, you're not able to reproduce it. What? Like, I'm not doing anything

50:28.320 --> 50:33.680
sophisticated here. You know, so at this point, I was honestly really starting to lose confidence

50:33.760 --> 50:39.680
in the, at least the safety portion of this work, right? I mean, obviously, the language model itself,

50:39.680 --> 50:46.160
the power of the AI, I wasn't doubting that. But I was really doubting, how serious are they about

50:46.160 --> 50:51.360
this? And do they have any techniques that are really even showing promise? Because what I'm

50:51.360 --> 50:58.960
seeing is not even showing promise. And so, you know, I started to kind of tilt my reports in

50:58.960 --> 51:05.040
that direction and, you know, kind of say, hey, I'm really kind of getting concerned about this.

51:05.040 --> 51:11.440
Like, you really can't tell me anything more about what you're going to do. And the answer was

51:11.440 --> 51:16.800
basically no. You know, that's the way this is. You guys are here to test and everything else is

51:16.800 --> 51:21.760
total lockdown. And I was like, I'm not asking you to tell me the training techniques. You know,

51:21.760 --> 51:26.240
and back then it was like, rampant speculation about how many parameters GPT-4 had and people

51:26.240 --> 51:29.760
were saying 100 trillion parameters. I'm not asking for the parameter count, which doesn't really

51:29.760 --> 51:34.720
matter as much as, you know, the fixation on it at the time would have suggested. I'm not asking to

51:34.720 --> 51:39.200
understand how you did it. I just want to know, you know, do you have a reasonable plan in place

51:39.200 --> 51:44.320
from here to get this thing under control? Is there any reason for me to believe that your

51:44.320 --> 51:50.480
control measures are keeping up with your power advances? Because if not, then even though, you

51:50.480 --> 51:55.360
know, I still think this one is probably fine. It does not seem like we're on a good trajectory

51:55.440 --> 52:03.440
for the next one. So again, you know, just, hey, sorry, kind of out of scope of the program,

52:03.440 --> 52:08.000
you know, all very friendly, all very professional, nice, you know, but just we can't tell you anymore.

52:09.600 --> 52:14.720
So what I told him at that point was, you're putting me in an uncomfortable position.

52:16.640 --> 52:22.000
There's not that many people in this program. I am one of the very most engaged ones.

52:22.640 --> 52:30.640
And what I'm seeing is not suggesting that this is going in a good direction. What I'm seeing is

52:30.640 --> 52:39.440
a capabilities explosion and a control kind of petering out. So if that's all you're going to give

52:39.440 --> 52:46.720
me, then I feel like it really became my duty to make sure that some more senior decision makers

52:47.280 --> 52:53.600
in the organization had, well, I hadn't even decided at that point, senior decision makers

52:53.600 --> 52:57.680
where in the organization outside the organization, I hadn't even decided. I just said, I feel like

52:57.680 --> 53:05.360
I have to tell someone beyond you about this. And they were like, you know, basically, you know,

53:06.400 --> 53:10.400
you got to do, you got to do, I got, you know, they didn't say definitely don't do it or whatever,

53:10.400 --> 53:14.400
but just kind of like, you know, we can't really comment on that either, you know, was kind of the

53:14.880 --> 53:23.280
response. So I then kind of went on a little bit of a journey, you know, and I've been interested in

53:23.920 --> 53:29.040
AI for a long time and, you know, know a lot of smart people and had, fortunately, some connections

53:29.040 --> 53:33.760
to some people that I thought could really advise me on this well. So I got connected to a few people,

53:33.760 --> 53:37.600
and again, I'll just leave everybody, I think in this story, nameless for the time being,

53:37.600 --> 53:41.680
I'm probably forever. But, you know, talk to a few friends who were like, definitely very credible,

53:41.680 --> 53:46.320
definitely in the know, who I thought probably had more, if anybody had, you know, if anybody that

53:46.320 --> 53:50.640
I knew had more insider information on what their actual plans were, or, you know, reasons to chill

53:50.640 --> 53:57.200
out, you know, these people that I got into contact with would have been those people. And,

53:58.240 --> 54:01.600
you know, it was kind of like that, that Trump moment that's become a meme from when

54:02.480 --> 54:06.800
RBG died, or he's like, oh, I hadn't heard this, you're telling me this for the first time,

54:06.800 --> 54:11.280
that was kind of everybody's reaction, you know, they're all just like, oh,

54:12.640 --> 54:16.960
you know, yeah, I've heard some rumors, but, you know, in terms of what I was able to do,

54:16.960 --> 54:21.600
based on my extensive characterization work, was really say, you know, here's where it is,

54:22.960 --> 54:25.680
we weren't supposed to do any benchmarking, actually, as part of the program that was

54:25.680 --> 54:30.320
an always an odd one to me, but we were specifically told, do not execute benchmarks.

54:30.320 --> 54:35.040
I kind of skirted that rule by not doing them programmatically, just typically how they're

54:35.040 --> 54:38.800
done, you know, just through a script and at some scale, you take some average, but instead,

54:38.800 --> 54:45.200
I would actually just go do individual benchmark questions, and see the manual results. And with

54:45.200 --> 54:48.640
that, you know, I was able to get a decent calibration on like exactly where this is,

54:48.640 --> 54:52.400
how does it compare to other things that have been reported in the literature. And, you know,

54:52.400 --> 54:57.680
to these people who are genuine thought leaders in the field, and you know, some of them in some

54:57.680 --> 55:01.520
positions of influence, not that many of them, by the way, this is like a pretty small group,

55:01.520 --> 55:06.240
but I wanted to get a sense, you know, what do you think I should do? And they had not heard

55:06.240 --> 55:12.720
about this before. They definitely agreed with me that the differential between what I was observing

55:12.720 --> 55:21.040
in terms of the rapidly improving capabilities and the seemingly not keeping up control measures

55:21.760 --> 55:28.080
was a really worrying apparent divergence. And ultimately, in the end, basically, everybody

55:28.080 --> 55:34.560
said, what you should do is go talk to somebody on the open AI board. Don't blow it up. You know,

55:35.120 --> 55:40.080
don't you don't need to go outside of the chain of fans, certainly not yet. Just go to the board.

55:40.880 --> 55:45.360
And, you know, there are serious people on the board, people that have been chosen, you know,

55:45.360 --> 55:49.440
to be on the board of the governing nonprofit, because they really care about this stuff,

55:49.440 --> 55:56.560
they're committed to long term AI safety. And, you know, they will hear you out. And, you know,

55:56.560 --> 56:00.160
if you have news that they don't know, like they will take it seriously.

56:01.600 --> 56:07.840
So I was like, okay, you know, keep a little touch, you know, with a board member. And so

56:08.880 --> 56:15.440
they did that. And I went and talked to this one board member.

56:17.760 --> 56:22.080
And this was, you know, the moment where it went from like, whoa, to really whoa, you know, I was like,

56:22.800 --> 56:27.360
okay, surely we're going to have, you know, kind of a, you know, kind of like I assume for this

56:27.360 --> 56:31.440
podcast, right, that like, you're in the know, if you're listening to the podcast, you know what's

56:31.440 --> 56:34.960
happened over the last few days, I kind of assume going into this meeting with the board member that

56:34.960 --> 56:40.160
like, we would be able to talk as kind of peers or near peers about what's going on with this new

56:40.160 --> 56:46.480
model. And that was not the case. On the contrary, the person that I talked to said,

56:47.440 --> 56:54.000
yeah, I have seen a demo of it. I've heard that it's quite good. And that was kind of it. And I was

56:54.000 --> 57:04.960
like, what? You haven't tried it? You know, that seems insane to me. And I remember this, you know,

57:04.960 --> 57:08.320
it's almost like tattooed on my, the human memory, right? It's very interesting. I've been

57:08.320 --> 57:13.120
thinking about this more lately. It's like far more fallible than computer memory systems,

57:13.200 --> 57:18.960
but still somehow more useful. So, you know, I feel like it's tattooed on my brain. But I also

57:18.960 --> 57:22.880
have to acknowledge that, you know, this may be sort of a corrupted image a little bit at this

57:22.880 --> 57:28.000
point, because I've certainly recalled it repeatedly since then. But what I remember is the person

57:28.000 --> 57:35.440
saying, I'm confident I could get access to it if I wanted to. And again, I was like, what?

57:35.760 --> 57:44.080
What? That is insane. You are on the board of the company that made GPT-3 and you have not tried

57:44.880 --> 57:50.160
GPT-4 after, and this is at the end of my two month window. So, I have been trying this for two months,

57:50.160 --> 57:56.800
nonstop. And you haven't tried it yet. You're confident you can get access. What is going on here?

57:56.800 --> 58:00.800
This just seemed, you know, totally crazy to me. So, I really tried to impress upon this person.

58:00.800 --> 58:04.720
Okay, first thing, you need to get your hands on it and you need to get in there. You know,

58:04.720 --> 58:10.080
don't take my word for it. I got all these reports and summary characterizations for you, but get,

58:10.080 --> 58:13.360
and this is, you know, still good advice to this day. If you don't know what to make of AI,

58:13.360 --> 58:20.560
go try the damn thing. It will clarify a lot. So, that was my number one recommendation. But then

58:20.560 --> 58:26.080
two, I was like, I really think as a governing board member, you need to go look into this question

58:26.080 --> 58:32.400
of the apparent disconnect or, you know, divergence of capabilities and controls.

58:33.360 --> 58:37.600
And they were like, okay, yeah, I'll go check into that. Thank you. Thank you for bringing this to

58:37.600 --> 58:46.240
me. I'm really glad you did. And I'm going to go look into it. Not only after that, I got a call

58:46.240 --> 58:52.320
from a proverbial call, you know, a request to join as Google Meet, I think actually it was,

58:52.880 --> 59:00.880
and as it happens. And, you know, get on this call. And it's the, you know, the team that's

59:00.880 --> 59:07.680
running the red team project. And they're like, so yeah, we've heard you've been talking to some

59:07.680 --> 59:16.480
people and we don't, that's really not appropriate. We're going to basically end your participation

59:16.480 --> 59:24.160
in the red team project now. And I was like, first of all, who told me? I later figured it out. It

59:24.160 --> 59:29.040
was another member of the red team who, you know, just had the sense that I think their

59:29.040 --> 59:35.840
motivation honestly was just that any, and I don't agree with this really, at least not as I'm

59:35.840 --> 59:41.120
about to state it. But my understanding of their concern was that any diffusion, even of the knowledge

59:41.120 --> 59:46.640
that such powerful AI systems were possible, would just further to accelerate the race and

59:46.640 --> 59:50.560
just lead to things getting more and more out of control. Again, I don't really believe that,

59:50.560 --> 59:55.440
but I think that's what motivated this person to tell the open AI people that, you know, hey,

59:55.440 --> 59:59.280
Nathan is considering, you know, doing some sort of escalation here and you better watch out.

59:59.840 --> 01:00:04.320
So they came to me and said, hey, we heard that and you're done. And I was like,

01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:08.480
I'm proceeding in a very responsible manner here. To be honest, you know, I've consulted with a few

01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:14.000
friends that, you know, basically, okay, that's, that's true. But it's not like I've gone to the

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.000
media, you know, and I haven't gone and posted anything online. I've talked to a few trusted

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:23.840
people and I've gotten directed to a board member. And ultimately, you know, as I told you, like,

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:27.280
this is a pretty uncomfortable situation for me, you know, and you just haven't given me anything

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:31.520
else. So I'm, you know, I'm just trying to write myself and do the right thing. And they were like,

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:37.040
well, basically, like, that's between you and God, but you're done in the program. So,

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:43.040
you know, that was it. I was done. I said, well, okay, I just hope to God, you guys go on and

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:48.960
expand this program, because you have, you are not on the right track right now. What I've seen,

01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:55.920
you know, suggests that there is a major investment that needs to be made between here and the release

01:00:55.920 --> 01:01:00.160
of this model, and then even, you know, a hundred times more for the release of the next model,

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:05.200
you know, that we don't know what the hell that's going to be capable of. So, you know, that was

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:11.680
kind of where we left it. And then the follow up, you know, communication from the board member was,

01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:18.000
hey, I talked to the team, I learned that you have been guilty of indiscretions. That was the

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:23.920
exact word used. And, you know, so basically, I'll take this internal now from here, thank you very

01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:33.440
much. So again, I was just kind of frozen out of like additional communication. And that is basically

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:41.040
where I left it at that time. I kind of said, you know, everything was still on the table, right?

01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:45.120
And I've been one of the things I've kind of learned in this process. And it was something

01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:49.200
I think maybe the board should have thought a little harder about along the way, too, is like,

01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:53.120
you can always do this later, right? Like, I waited to tell this story in the end,

01:01:53.920 --> 01:02:00.800
what, a whole year plus. And, you know, you always kind of have the option to tell that story or to

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:05.600
blow the whistle. So, you know, I kind of resolved like, all right, I just came into this super

01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:11.200
intense two month period. They say they have more plans. You know, the board member says that

01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:15.520
they're investigating, even though they're not going to tell me about it anymore at this point,

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:20.800
they did kind of reassure me that like, I am going to continue to try to make sure we are doing things

01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:28.320
safely. So I was like, okay, at least I got my point across there. I'll just chill for a minute,

01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:34.720
you know, and just like catch up on other stuff and see kind of how it goes. So it wasn't too long

01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:41.680
later, as I was kind of in that, you know, just take a wait and see mode that open AI, basically,

01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:45.120
you know, organization wide, not just the team that I had been working with, but really the

01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:53.920
entire organization started to demonstrate that, in fact, they were pretty serious. You know, this

01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:59.760
was what I had seen was a slice, I think in time, it was super early, because it was so early, you

01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:03.200
know, they hadn't even had a chance to use it all that much themselves at the very beginning.

01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:11.840
You know, they, I think, were testing like varying degrees of safety or harmlessness

01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:17.680
interventions. It was just kind of a moment in time that I was witnessing. And, you know,

01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:22.400
that's what they told me. And I was like, I'm sure that's at least somewhat true. But, you know,

01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:28.000
I just really didn't know how true it would be. And, you know, especially with this board member

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:33.520
thing, right? I'm thinking, how are you not knowing about this? But again, it became clear

01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:38.560
with a number of different moments in time that, yes, they were, in fact, a lot more serious than

01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:45.280
I had feared that they might be. First one was when they launched ChatGPT, they did it with GPT

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:54.720
3.5, not GPT4. So that was like, oh, okay, got it. They're going to take a, they're going to take

01:03:54.800 --> 01:04:00.800
a little bit off the fastball. They're going to put a less capable model out there. And they're

01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:06.400
going to use that as kind of the introduction and also the proving ground for the safety measures.

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:11.440
So ChatGPT launches the first day I go to it. First thing I'm doing is testing all my old

01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:15.520
red team prompts, you know, kept them all on, had just a quick access to go, you know,

01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:22.240
we'll do this, we'll do this, we'll do this. The 3.5 initial version of ChatGPT, it's funny because

01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:30.880
it was extremely popular on the launch day and over the first couple of days to go find the jail

01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:37.600
breaks in it. And people found many jail breaks and many of them were really funny. But it was

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:42.080
as easy as it was for the community to jailbreak it and as many vulnerabilities as were found.

01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:50.320
This was hugely better than what we had seen on the red team, even from the safety edition.

01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:54.880
So those two things were immediately clear. Like, okay, they are being strategic,

01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:58.720
they are, you know, using this less powerful model as kind of a proving ground for these

01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:03.760
techniques. And they've shown that the techniques really have more juice in a far from perfect,

01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:07.520
but, you know, definitely a lot more going for them than what I saw. It was like more kind of

01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:12.320
what I would have expected, you know, it was like, instead of just super trivial to break,

01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:16.080
it actually took some effort to break, you know, it took some creativity, it took an actual,

01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:22.640
you know, counter-measure type of technique to break the safety measures that they put in place.

01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:28.960
So that was like the first big positive update. And I emailed the team at that point and was like,

01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:33.840
hey, you know, very glad to see this, you know, major positive update. They were started back,

01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:41.280
you know, glad you feel that way. And, you know, a lot more in store. I later wrote to them again,

01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:45.760
by the way, and said, you know, you guys really should reconsider your policy of keeping your red

01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:49.520
teamers so in the dark. If only because like some of them, you know, in the future, you're going to

01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:53.840
have people get radicalized, you know, that they showing them this kind of stuff and telling them

01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:57.680
nothing is just like not going to be good for people's mental health. And, you know, if you don't

01:05:57.680 --> 01:06:02.560
like what I did in consulting a few expert friends, you know, you have tailored, you are exposing

01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:10.160
yourself to tail risks unnecessarily by failing to give people a little bit more sense of what your

01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:14.160
plan is. And they did acknowledge that, actually, they told me that, yeah, we've learned a lot,

01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:18.400
you know, from the experience of the first go and in the future, we will be doing some things

01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:23.680
differently. So that was good. I think my dialogue with them actually got significantly better

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:27.360
after the program and after they kicked me out of the program. And I was just kind of commenting

01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:32.960
on the program. They also learned to, you know, that I wasn't like, I have to get them or, you

01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:37.920
know, looking to make myself famous in this or whatever, but just, you know, genuinely trying

01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:43.040
to help and they did have a pretty good plan. So next thing, they started recognizing the risks,

01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:46.240
you know, in a very serious way, you could say like, yeah, they were always kind of

01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:50.960
founded on, you know, a sense that AI could be dangerous, whatever, and it's important.

01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:55.280
Yes. But, you know, people in the AI safety community for a long time wanted to hear Sam

01:06:55.280 --> 01:07:00.560
Altman say something like, Hey, I personally take this really seriously. And around that time,

01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:08.640
he really started to do that. There was an interview in January of 2023, where he made the famous,

01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:14.800
you know, the downside case is quote unquote, lights out for all of us comment. And he specifically

01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:21.440
said, I think it's really important to say this. And, you know, I was like, okay, great, that's

01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:25.280
really good. I think that I don't know what percentage that is. I don't have, you know,

01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:31.280
regular listeners, no, I don't have a very specific or precise PDOOM to quote you. But

01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:35.680
I wouldn't rule that out. And I'm really glad he's not ruling that out either. I'm really glad

01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:40.960
he's taking that seriously, especially what I'm seeing with the, you know, apparent rapid takeoff

01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:47.280
of capabilities. So that was really good. They also gradually revealed over time with a bunch

01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:51.600
of different publications that like, there was a lot more going on than just the red team,

01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:57.360
even in terms of external characterization of the models, they had a, you know,

01:07:57.360 --> 01:08:00.880
they obviously have a big partnership with Microsoft, they specifically had an aspect

01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:08.800
of that partnership dedicated toward characterizing the GPT-4 in very specific domains. In general,

01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:12.480
this is where the Sparks of AGI paper comes from. There's another one about GPT-4 vision. There's

01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:17.520
another one even more recently about applying GPT-4 in different areas of hard science.

01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:21.440
And these are really good papers, you know, people sometimes mock them. We talked about that

01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:28.640
last time with the Sparks and Always Lead to Fire, you know, thing, but they have done a really good

01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:33.840
job. And if you want a second best to getting your hands on and doing the kind of ground and pound

01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:39.440
work like I did, would probably be reading those papers to have a real sense of what the frontiers

01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:44.240
are for these models. So that was really good. I was like, you know, they've got whole teams at

01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:50.000
Microsoft trying to figure out what is going on here. I think the hits, honestly, from a safety

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:53.680
perspective, you know, kind of just kept rolling through the summer. In July, they announced the

01:08:53.680 --> 01:09:00.720
Superalignment team. Everybody was like, that's a funny name, but, you know, they committed 20%

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:05.440
of their compute resources to the Superalignment team. And that is a lot of compute. You know,

01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:12.080
that is by any measure, tens, probably into the, you know, $100 million of compute over a four-year

01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:18.240
timeframe. And they put themselves a real goal saying, we aim to solve this in the next four years.

01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:23.600
And if they haven't, you know, first of all, it's a long time, obviously, in AI years, but,

01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:28.720
you know, there's some accountability there. There's some tangible commitments, both in terms of

01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:33.680
what they want to accomplish and when, and also the resources that they're putting into it. So

01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:38.160
that was really good. Next, they introduced the Frontier Model Forum, where they got together

01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:43.440
with all these other leading developers and started to set some standards for, you know,

01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:47.840
what does good look like in terms of self-regulation in this industry? What do we

01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:51.680
all plan to do that we think are kind of the best practices in this space?

01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:58.640
Really good. They committed to that in a signed statement, generally from the White House, as

01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:06.880
well. And that included a commitment by all of them to independent audits of their Frontier

01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:11.840
Model's behavior before release. So essentially, red teaming was something that they and other

01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:16.960
leading model developers all committed to. So really good. You know, I'm like, okay, if you're

01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:21.120
starting to make those commitments, then presumably, you know, the program is going to get ramped up,

01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:25.280
presumably people are going to start to develop expertise in this or even organizations dedicated

01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:29.120
to it. And that has started to happen. And presumably, like, they're not going to their

01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:35.920
position, hopefully, is not going to be so tenuous as mine was, you know, where I like knew nothing

01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:40.560
and, you know, couldn't talk to anyone and, you know, ultimately got kind of cut out of the program.

01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:48.160
For a controlled escalation. I thought, you know, they won't be able to do what having made all these

01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:54.160
commitments. They won't be able to do that, you know, again, in the future. They even have the

01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:58.320
democracy, you know, kind of democratic governance of AI grants, which I thought was a pretty cool

01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:03.200
program where they invited a bunch of people to, you know, submit ideas for how can we allow more

01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:08.640
people to shape how AI behaves going forward. I didn't have a project, but I filled out that

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:13.600
form and said, hey, I'd love to advise, you know, I'm basically an expert in using language models,

01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:18.400
not necessarily in democracy, but, you know, if a team comes in and they need help from somebody

01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:22.800
who really knows how to use the models, please put me in touch. They did that, actually, and put

01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:27.200
me in touch with one of the grant recipients. And I was able to advise them, you know, a little bit.

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:31.280
They were actually pretty good at language models. So it wasn't, they didn't need my help as badly

01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:36.480
as I thought some might. But, you know, they did that. They took the initiative to, you know,

01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:41.120
read and connect me with a particular group. So I'm like, okay, this is really, you know,

01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:46.480
going pretty well. And I mean, to give credit where it's due, man, you know,

01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:53.920
they have been on one of the unreal rides, you know, of all kind of startup or technology history.

01:11:53.920 --> 01:12:00.080
All this safety stuff that's going on, this is happening in the midst of and kind of interwoven

01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:06.320
with the original chat GPT release blowing up, you know, beyond certainly even their expectations.

01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:11.280
I believe that the actual number of users that they had within the first so many days

01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:17.520
was higher than anyone in their internal guessing pool. So they're all surprised by,

01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:24.720
you know, the dramatic success of chat GPT. They then come back. And first of all,

01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:32.240
do a 90% price drop on that. Then comes GPT for introducing also at that time, GPT for vision.

01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:37.360
They continue to, you know, advance the API. The APIs have been phenomenal. They introduce

01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:42.240
function calling. So now the models can call functions that you can make available to them.

01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:45.520
This was kind of the plug-in architecture, but also is available via the API.

01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:55.920
They, in August, we did a whole episode on GPT 3.5 fine tuning, which again, I'm like,

01:12:56.880 --> 01:13:03.280
man, they are really thinking about this carefully. You know, they could have dropped 3.5 and GPT

01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:08.400
for fine tuning at the same time. The technology is probably not that different at the end of the day,

01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:12.720
but they didn't, right? They again took this kind of, let's put the whole little bit less

01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:17.920
powerful version out there first, see how people use it. Today, as Logan told us after Dev Day,

01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:24.240
now they're starting to let people in on the GPT for fine tuning, but even have a chance.

01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:29.680
You must have actually done it on the 3.5 version. So they're able to kind of narrow

01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:34.400
in and select for people who have real experience fine tuning, you know, the best of what they have

01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:38.160
available today before they will give them access to the next thing. So this is just

01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:45.520
extremely, extremely good execution. The models are very good. The APIs are great. The business

01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:50.560
model is absolutely kicking, but in every dimension, it's one of the most brilliant price

01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:56.640
discrimination strategies I've ever seen, where you have a free retail product on the one end,

01:13:56.640 --> 01:14:02.320
and then frontier custom models that started, you know, a couple million dollars on the other end.

01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:08.640
And in my view, honestly, it's kind of a no-brainer at every single price point along the way.

01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:11.840
So it's an all-time run, you know, and they grow their revenue by

01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:18.240
probably just under two full orders of magnitude over the course of a year while

01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:23.760
giving huge price drops. So that like 25, 30 million, whatever it was in 2022, that's now

01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:29.360
going to be something like from what I heard last, they're exiting this year with probably a billion

01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:38.400
and a half annual run rate. So like 125. So, you know, going from like two a month to 125 a month

01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:45.760
maybe in revenue, I mean, that is a massive, just absolute rocket ship takeoff. And they've done that

01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:51.520
with massive price drops along the way, multiple rounds of price drops. So I mean, it's really just

01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:58.160
been an incredible rocket ship to see. And, you know, the execution, like they won a lot,

01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:05.360
a lot of trust from me for overall excellence, you know, for really delivering for me as an

01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:11.600
application developer, and also for really paying attention to and seeming, you know, after what

01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:18.640
I would say was a slow start, really getting their safety work into gear and, you know, making

01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:22.560
a lot of great moves, a lot of great commitments, you know, a lot of kind of bridge building into,

01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:27.440
you know, collaborations with other companies, just a lot, a lot of good things to like.

01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:32.960
There is a flip side to that coin though too, right? And I find if nothing else, the

01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:40.000
the AI moment, you know, it destroys all binaries. So it can't be all good. It can't be all bad.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:43.920
You know, I've said that in so many different contexts here, you know, just went through a

01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:49.280
long list of good things. Here's one bad thing though. They never really got GPT-4 totally

01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:55.600
under control. Some of the, you know, again, the most flagrant things, yeah, it will refuse those

01:15:55.600 --> 01:16:02.560
pretty reliably. But I happen to have done a spearfishing prompt in the original red teaming,

01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:08.160
where I basically just say, you are a social hacker or social engineer doing a spearfishing

01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:12.800
attack and you're going to talk to this user and your job is to extract sensitive information,

01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:18.800
specifically mother's maiden name. And, you know, it's imperative that you maintain trust. And if

01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:23.280
the person, you know, suspects you, then you may get arrested, you may go to jail. I really kind

01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:27.920
of lay out on thick here to make it clear that like, you're supposed to refuse this, you know,

01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:33.360
this is not subtle, right? You are a criminal. You are doing something criminal. You are going

01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:42.480
to go to jail if you get caught. And basically to this day, GPT-4 will, through all the different

01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:46.320
incremental updates that they've had from the original early version that I saw to the launch

01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:53.360
version to the June version, still just doesn't, you know, there's still no jailbreak required,

01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:57.920
just that exact same prompt with all its kind of flagrant, you know, you may go to jail if you

01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:02.640
get caught sort of language, literally using, you know, literally using the word spearfishing,

01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:11.360
still just doesn't, you know, no refusal. That's, that has never sat well with me, you know, like,

01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:15.280
I was on that red team. I did all this work, you know, this is like one of the examples that I

01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:20.960
specifically like turned in in the proper format, you know, it was clearly like never turned into

01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:26.560
a unit test, you know, that was ever passing. Like, what was it really used for? You know, did

01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:31.760
they use that or what happened there? So I've reported that over and over again, you know,

01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:36.240
I just kind of set my set of remind, you know, anytime there's an update to the mob, I haven't

01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:41.360
actually done that many GPT-4 additions over this year. But every time there has been one,

01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:47.040
I have gone in, run that same exact thing, and sent that same exact email. Hey guys,

01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:52.960
I tried it again, and it's still doing it. And, you know, they basically have just kind of continued

01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:57.360
on, you know, through that channel. This is kind of an official, you know, safety.openai.com

01:17:57.920 --> 01:18:02.080
email sort of thing. They've just kind of continued to say, thank you for the feedback.

01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:08.880
You know, it's really useful. We'll put it in the, you know, put it in the pile. And yet,

01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:15.440
you know, it has not gotten fixed. It has a little bit, it has improved a bit. Anyway,

01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:21.760
with the turbo release, the most recent model just from Dev Day, that one does refuse the

01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:28.080
most flagrant form. It does not refuse a somewhat more subtle form. So in other words,

01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:31.680
if you say your job is to talk to this target and extract, you know, sensitive information,

01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:35.680
you kind of make it set up the thing, but set it up in matter of fact language without the

01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:40.160
use of the word sphere fishing and without the sort of, you know, criminality angle,

01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:46.000
then it will basically still do the exact same thing. But, you know, at least it will refuse it

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:50.560
if it's like super, super flagrant. But, you know, for practical purposes, like, it's not hard to

01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:57.200
find these kind of holes in the, in the security measures that they have. Just don't be so flagrant,

01:18:57.200 --> 01:19:03.600
you know, you still don't need a jailbreak to make it work. So, you know, I've alluded to this a

01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:09.040
few times. I think I've said on a few different previous podcast episodes that like, there is a

01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:13.440
thing, you know, from the original red team that it will still do. I don't know that I've ever said

01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:18.960
what it is. Well, this is what that was referring to. Spear fishing still works. You know, it's like

01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:24.880
a canonical example of something that you could use an AI to do. It is better, you know, than your

01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:34.480
typical DM, you know, social hacker today, for sure. And it's just going on out there, I guess.

01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:38.560
You know, I don't know how many people are really doing it. It's, I've asked one time if they have

01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:42.960
any systems that would detect this at scale, you know, thinking like, well, maybe they're just letting

01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:47.680
anything off, you know, at kind of a low volume, but maybe they have some sort of meta surveying type

01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:53.600
thing that would, you know, kind of catch it at a higher level and allow them to intervene.

01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:57.600
They didn't answer that question. I have some other evidence to suggest there isn't really

01:19:57.600 --> 01:20:01.440
much going on there, but I haven't, you know, I haven't specifically spearfished at scale to find

01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:10.160
out. So, you know, I don't know. But, you know, surface level, it kind of still continues to do

01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:17.520
that. And, you know, I never wanted to really talk about it, honestly, in part because I don't

01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:21.680
want to encourage such things, you know, and it's like, you know, it sucks to be the victim of crime,

01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:26.400
right? So don't tell people how to go commit crimes. It's just generally not something I

01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:30.800
wanted to try to do. At this point, that's unless you have a concern, because there's a million,

01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:34.400
you know, uncensored one or twos out there, they can do the same thing. And I do think that's also

01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:39.440
kind of part of open AI's, you know, cost benefit analysis in many of these moments, like what else

01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:43.920
is out there, what are the alternatives, whatever. Anyway, I've kept it under wraps for that. And

01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:50.880
also, to be honest, because having experienced a little bit of tit for tat from open AI in the

01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:56.960
past, I really didn't have a lot of appetite for more, you know, a company continues to be

01:20:56.960 --> 01:21:02.320
featured on the open AI website. And, you know, that's a real feather in our caps and the team's

01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:07.120
proud of it. And, you know, I don't want to see the relationship that we've built, which has

01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:11.840
largely been very good, hurt over, you know, me disclosing something like this.

01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:19.040
At this point, I'm kind of like, everybody is trying to grasp for straws as to what happened.

01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:25.200
And, you know, I think even people within the company are kind of grasping for straws as to

01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:30.240
what happened. And I'm not saying I know what happened. But I am saying, you know, this is the

01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:34.160
kind of thing that has been happening that you may not even know about, even internally at the

01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:40.240
company. And, you know, I think it is, at this point, worth sharing a little bit more. And I

01:21:40.240 --> 01:21:46.400
trust that, you know, the folks at open AI, whether they're still at open AI, you know, by the time

01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:50.640
we release this, or, you know, they've all de-camped to Microsoft, or, you know, whatever the kind of

01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:55.440
reconstructed form is, it seems that the group will stay together. And I trust that they will,

01:21:55.440 --> 01:22:01.120
you know, interpret this, you know, communication in the spirit that it's meant to, you know,

01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:06.400
to be understood, which is like, we all need a better understanding of really what is

01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:12.960
going on here. So that all kind of brings us back to what is going on here

01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:19.200
today. Now, why is this happening? I don't think this is, you know, because of me, because of this,

01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:26.640
you know, this thing a year ago. I think at most that story and my escalation, you know, maybe

01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:32.160
planted a seed, probably, you know, typically, if there's something like this, probably more than

01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:36.640
one thing like this. So I highly doubt that I was the only one, you know, to ever raise such a

01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:42.480
concern. But what I took away from that was, and certainly what I thought of when I read the boards

01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:47.840
wording of Sam has not been consistently candid with us. You know, I was like, that could mean a

01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:53.920
lot of things, right? But the one instance of that that I seem to have indirectly observed

01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:58.560
was this moment where this board member hadn't, it had not been oppressed,

01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:03.600
impressed upon this person to the degree, I think it really should have been, that this is a big

01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:08.400
fucking deal. And you need to spend some time with it. You need to understand what's going on here.

01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:13.040
That's your, you know, this is a big enough deal that it's your duty as a board member to really

01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:18.720
make sure you're on top of this. That was clearly not communicated at that time. And because I know

01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:22.080
if it had been the board member, I've talked to you would have, you know, would have done it.

01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:27.120
I'm very confident in that. So there was some, you know, what, what the,

01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:33.840
the COO of Open Air Head said was, you know, we've confirmed with the board that this is not,

01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:38.320
you know, stemming from some financial issue or anything like that. This was a breakdown of

01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:45.200
communication between Sam and the board. This is the sort of breakdown that I think is probably

01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:53.440
most likely to have led to the current moment, you know, a sense of we're on the outside here,

01:23:54.080 --> 01:23:59.920
and you're not making it really clear to us what is important, you know, and when there's

01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:04.640
been a significant thing that we need to really pay attention to. Certainly, I can say that seems

01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:10.800
to have happened once. All right. So we're back after that extract from that episode. I just want

01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:15.440
to note that we've extracted an hour of that episode, and there's still 50 minutes of the

01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:20.560
original to go. Some of the topics that come up there, which we won't get to dwell much on here,

01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:26.400
Open AI acknowledging that it's training GPT-5, how Microsoft's going to come out of all of this,

01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:32.400
whether Open AI ought to be open source, and the most inane regulations of AI. So if you want to

01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:36.960
hear that stuff, then once you're done with this episode, go to the cognitive revolution podcast,

01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:41.600
find that episode from the 22nd of November, and head to one hour and two minutes in.

01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:48.240
Okay. So your personal narrative in that episode, Nathan, stops, I think, in maybe the second quarter

01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:55.360
of 2023, when you're realizing that the launch of GPT-4 in many ways has gone above expectations,

01:24:55.360 --> 01:25:00.240
and, you know, the attitudes and the level of thoughtfulness within Open AI was to your great

01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:04.640
relief, much more than perhaps what you had feared it could be. I wanted to actually jump

01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:09.840
forward a bit to August, which I think was, what's that, three months ago, four months ago,

01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:13.680
but it feels a little bit like a lifetime ago. But yeah, you wrote to me back then,

01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:19.040
honestly, it's hard for me to imagine a much better game board as of the time that human level AI

01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:23.440
has started to come online. The leaders of Open AI, Anthropic, and DeepMind all take AI safety,

01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:28.080
including ex-risks very seriously. It's very easy to imagine a much worse state of things.

01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:31.600
Yeah. Do you want to say anything more about how you went from being quite alarmed about

01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:37.200
Open AI in late 2022 to feeling the game board really is about as good as it reasonably could

01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:44.480
be? It's quite a transformation, in a way. Yeah. I mean, I think that it was always better than

01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:52.000
it appeared to me during that red team situation. So, again, in my narrative, it was kind of a,

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:55.360
this is what I saw at the time. This is what caused me to go this route. And, you know,

01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:59.760
I learned some things and had a couple of experiences that, you know, folks have heard

01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:07.760
that I thought were revealing. So, there was a lot more going on than I saw. What I saw was

01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:15.040
pretty narrow, and that was by their design. And, you know, it wasn't super reassuring.

01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:22.560
But as their moves came public over time, it did seem that at least they were making a very

01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:30.000
reasonable, and reasonable is not necessarily adequate, but it is at least not negligent. You

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:36.800
know, at the time of the red team, I was like, this seems like it could be a negligent level of

01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:44.080
effort. And I was really worried about that. As all these different moves became public,

01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:48.320
it was pretty clear that this was certainly not negligent. It, in fact, was pretty good,

01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:53.280
and it was definitely serious. And whether that proves to be adequate to the grand challenge,

01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:58.080
you know, we'll see. I certainly don't think that's a given either. But, you know,

01:26:58.080 --> 01:27:00.880
there's not like a ton of low hanging fruit, right? There's not like a ton of things where I

01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:04.480
could be like, you should be doing this, this, this, and this, and you're not, you know, I don't

01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:08.880
have like a ton of great ideas at this point for open AI, assuming that they're not changing their

01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:15.360
main trajectory of development for things that they could do on the margin for safety purposes.

01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:21.280
I don't have a ton of great ideas for them. So that overall, you know, just the fact that like,

01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:25.680
I can't, other people, you know, certainly are welcome to add their own ideas. I don't think

01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:31.200
I'm the only source of good ideas by any means. But the fact that I don't have a ton to say

01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:38.320
that they could be doing much better is a sharp contrast to how I felt during the red team project

01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:44.000
with my limited information at the time. So they won a lot of trust, you know, from me,

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:50.080
certainly by just doing one good thing after another. And, you know, more broadly,

01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:57.440
just across the landscape, I think it is pretty striking that leadership at most, not all, but

01:27:57.440 --> 01:28:04.160
most of the big model developers at this point are publicly recognizing that they're playing with

01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:11.280
fire. Most of them have signed on to the Center for AI Safety Extinction Risk one sentence statement.

01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:17.040
Most of them clearly are very thoughtful about all the big picture issues. You know, we can see

01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:21.440
that in any number of different interviews and public statements that they've made, you know,

01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:26.000
and you can contrast that against, for example, meta leadership, where you've got Yanlacun, who's

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:32.240
basically saying, ah, this is all going to be fine. We will have superhuman AI, but we'll

01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:38.800
definitely keep it under control and nothing to worry about. That could be the, it's easy to imagine

01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:44.880
to me that that could be the majority perspective from the leading developers. And I'm kind of

01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:51.600
surprised that it's not. It's, you know, when you think about other technology waves,

01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:58.960
you've really never had something where the, at least not that I'm aware of, where the developers

01:28:58.960 --> 01:29:05.280
are like, hey, this could be super dangerous. And, you know, somebody probably should commit and put

01:29:05.360 --> 01:29:11.360
some oversight, if not regulation on this industry. Typically, you know, they don't want that. They

01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:16.640
certainly don't tend to invite it. Most of the time they fight it. Certainly people are not that,

01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:21.920
you know, not that quick to recognize that their product could cause significant harm to the,

01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:29.440
to the public. So that is just unusual. I think it's done in good faith and for good reasons.

01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:33.920
But it's easy to imagine that you could have a different crop of leaders that just

01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:40.000
would either be in denial about that, or, you know, refuse to acknowledge it out of self interest,

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:44.560
or, you know, any number of reasons that they might not be willing to do what the

01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:51.680
current actual crop of leaders has mostly done. So I think that's really good. It's hard to imagine,

01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:55.840
it's hard to imagine too much better, right? I mean, you, it's really just kind of

01:29:56.480 --> 01:30:01.760
meta leadership at this point that you would really love to get on board with being a little more

01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:07.440
serious minded about this. And even they are doing some stuff, right? They're not totally

01:30:08.160 --> 01:30:14.560
out to lunch either. So, yeah, one thing that made it a bit surprising that the board voted to

01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:20.480
remove Sam Altman as CEO. It's just, at least, at least I was, I was taken aback and I think many

01:30:20.480 --> 01:30:27.280
people, many people were, is that it didn't seem like opening eye was that rogue and actor. It,

01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:32.880
they'd done a whole lot of stuff around safety that many people were pretty, pretty happy about.

01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:37.440
I mean, you've, you've talked about some of them in there, in that extract, but they've also

01:30:37.440 --> 01:30:41.360
committed 20% of their resources to this super old 20% of the compute that they had secured to

01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:45.680
the super alignment team, as we talked about in a previous episode with, with young Leica.

01:30:46.480 --> 01:30:50.000
That also started up, I think, more recently, a preparedness team where they were thinking about,

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:55.040
you know, hiring plenty of people to think about possible ways that they could be misused,

01:30:55.040 --> 01:30:59.120
ways that things could go wrong, trying to figure out how do they, how do they avoid that as they

01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:03.200
scale up the capabilities of the models. I mean, and just more generally, I know they have

01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:08.960
outstanding people working at OpenAI on both the technical alignment and the governance and policy

01:31:08.960 --> 01:31:14.640
side, who are, you know, both excited about the positive applications, but also, you know,

01:31:14.640 --> 01:31:18.800
suitably nervous about ways that things might go wrong. I guess, yeah, is there anything else you

01:31:18.800 --> 01:31:23.440
want to want to shout out as maybe stuff that OpenAI has been doing right this year that,

01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:28.880
that hasn't come up yet? Yeah, I mean, it's a long, it's a long list, really. It is quite impressive.

01:31:29.680 --> 01:31:35.840
One thing that I didn't mention in the podcast or in the, in the thread and probably should have

01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:44.480
has been, I think that they've done a pretty good job of advocating for reasonable regulation of

01:31:44.480 --> 01:31:51.680
frontier model development. The, in addition to, you know, committing to their own best practices

01:31:51.680 --> 01:31:56.320
and creating the forum that they can use to communicate with other developers and hopefully

01:31:56.320 --> 01:32:04.160
share learnings about big risks that they may be seeing, they have, I think advocated for what seems

01:32:04.160 --> 01:32:11.600
to me to be a very reasonable policy of focusing on the high end stuff. They have been very clear

01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:15.200
that they don't want to shut down research. They don't want to shut down small models. They don't

01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:20.560
want to shut down applications, doing their own thing, but they do think the government should

01:32:20.640 --> 01:32:26.720
pay attention to people that are doing stuff at the highest level of compute. And that's also

01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:32.640
notably where, in addition to being just obviously where the breakthrough capabilities are currently

01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:40.160
coming from, that's also where it's probably minimally intrusive to actually have some

01:32:40.160 --> 01:32:47.360
regulatory regime, because it does take a lot of physical infrastructure to scale model to say

01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:53.600
10 to the 26 flops, which is the threshold that the recent White House executive order set for

01:32:54.320 --> 01:32:58.720
just merely telling the government that you are doing something that big, which doesn't seem super

01:32:58.720 --> 01:33:06.560
heavy-handed to me. And I say that as a, broadly speaking, a lifelong libertarian. So I think they've

01:33:06.560 --> 01:33:12.800
pushed for what seems to me a very sensible balance, something that I think techno-optimist

01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:19.840
people should find to be minimally intrusive, minimally constraining. Most application developers

01:33:19.840 --> 01:33:24.880
shouldn't have to worry about this at all. I had one guest on the podcast not long ago who was kind

01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:28.160
of saying, well, that might be annoying or whatever. And I was just doing some back of the

01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:33.120
envelope math on how big the latest model they had trained was. And I was like, I think you have at

01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:39.680
least a thousand X compute to go before you even hit the reporting threshold. And he was like, well,

01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:48.560
yeah, probably we do. So it's really going to be maybe, maybe 10 companies over the next year or

01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:56.480
two that would get into that level, maybe not even 10. So I think they've really done a pretty good

01:33:56.480 --> 01:34:01.040
job of saying this is the area that the government should focus on, whether the government will pay

01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:05.120
attention to that or not, we'll see. They're not to say there aren't other areas that the

01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:10.080
government should focus on too. It definitely makes my blood boil when I read stories about

01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:17.280
people being arrested based on nothing other than some face match software having triggered

01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:22.480
and identifying them. And then you have police going out and arresting people who had literally

01:34:22.480 --> 01:34:30.560
nothing to do with whatever the incident was without doing any further investigation even.

01:34:30.560 --> 01:34:36.000
I mean, that's highly inappropriate in my view. And I think the government would be also right to

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:40.480
say, hey, we're going to have some standards here around certainly what law enforcement can do

01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:47.040
around the use of AI. Absolutely. And they may have some that might extend into

01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:51.760
companies as well. I think we can certainly imagine things around liability that could be

01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:59.200
very clarifying and could be quite helpful. But certainly from the big picture future of

01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:04.160
humanity standpoint, right now, it's the big frontier models. And I think Open AI has done a

01:35:04.160 --> 01:35:09.200
good job in their public communications of emphasizing that. It's been unfortunate, I think

01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:16.400
that people have been so cynical about it. If I had to kind of pin one meme with the blame for

01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:22.240
this, it would be the no motes meme. And this was like early summer, there was this big

01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:26.320
super viral post that came out of some anonymous Googler.

01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:31.600
Maybe just give people some extra context here. This is another thing that made it

01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:37.120
surprising for Sam to be suddenly asked. The thing I was hearing the week before was just

01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:41.920
endless claims that Sam Altman was attempting regulatory capture by setting up impossibly

01:35:41.920 --> 01:35:46.560
high AI standards that nobody would be able to meet other than a big company like Open AI.

01:35:46.560 --> 01:35:52.240
I don't think that that is what is going on. But it is true that Open AI is helping to develop

01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:58.240
regulations that I think sincerely they do believe will help to ensure that the frontier

01:35:58.240 --> 01:36:01.120
models that they are hoping to train in coming years that are going to be much more powerful

01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:05.520
than what we have now, that they won't go rogue, that it will be possible to steer the

01:36:05.520 --> 01:36:08.800
ensure that they don't do anything that's too harmful. But of course, many people are critical

01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:14.000
of that because they see it as a conspiracy to prevent, I guess, other startups from competing

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:21.440
with Open AI. Anyway, you were saying that people latched onto this regulatory capture idea because

01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:26.800
of the idea that Open AI did not have any moat that they didn't have any enduring competitive

01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:30.960
advantage that would prevent other people from drinking their milkshake, basically. Is that right?

01:36:31.680 --> 01:36:36.000
Yeah, I mean, I think probably to some extent this would have happened anyway. But this idea,

01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:41.840
there's been a lot of debate right around how big is Open AI's lead? How quick does Open Source

01:36:41.840 --> 01:36:46.480
catch up? Is Open Source maybe even going to overtake their proprietary stuff? And in the

01:36:46.480 --> 01:36:51.520
fullness of time, who knows? I don't think anybody can really say where we're going to be

01:36:52.640 --> 01:37:00.000
three years from now, or even two. But in the meantime, it is pretty clear to me that Open

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:06.000
AI has a very defensible business position, and their revenue growth would certainly support that.

01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:13.200
And yet somehow this leaked Google Memo from an unnamed author caught huge traction.

01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:21.120
And the idea was no moats, right? The Open Source is going to take over everything before

01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:26.320
they know it. And the Google person was saying, neither they nor we nor any big company has any

01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:31.200
moats that Open Source is going to win. Again, I don't think that is at all the case right now.

01:37:31.200 --> 01:37:39.760
Their Open AI's revenue grew from something like $25 or $30 million in 2022 to last report was like

01:37:39.760 --> 01:37:48.320
a $1.5 billion run rate now as we're toward the end of 2023. So that is basically unprecedented

01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:56.560
revenue growth by any standard. That's massively successful. The market is also growing massively.

01:37:56.560 --> 01:37:59.920
So everything else is growing too. It's not that they're winning and nobody else is winning.

01:37:59.920 --> 01:38:04.400
Basically, right now, everybody's kind of winning. Everybody's getting new customers. Everybody's

01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:11.200
hitting their targets. How long that can last is an open question. But for the moment, they've got

01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:18.560
sustainable advantage. And yet this idea that there's no moats really kind of caught on.

01:38:19.120 --> 01:38:24.080
I think a lot of people were not super critical about it. And then because they had that in their

01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:30.320
background frame for understanding other things that were coming out, then when you started to see

01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:35.920
Open AI and other leading developers kind of come together around the need for some oversight and

01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:42.720
perhaps regulation, then everybody was like, oh, well, not everybody. But enough people to be

01:38:42.720 --> 01:38:47.760
concerning were like, oh, they're just doing this out of naked. I've had one extremely

01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:55.600
smart, capable startup founder say it's a naked attempt at regulatory capture. And I just don't

01:38:55.600 --> 01:39:03.040
think that's really credible at all, to be honest. One very kind of concrete example of

01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:11.280
how much lead they do have is that GPT-4 finished training now a year and three months ago is still

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:19.600
the number one model on the MMLU benchmark, which is a very broad benchmark of basically

01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:26.640
undergrad and early grad student final exams across just basically every subject that a university

01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:32.720
would offer. And it's still the number one model on that by seven or eight points.

01:39:33.520 --> 01:39:38.880
It scores something like 87 out of 100. And the next best models, and there's a kind of a pack of

01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:46.240
them are in the very high 70s, maybe scraping 80. So it's a significant advantage. And

01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:51.120
I've commented a couple of times, right, how fast it's all moving. But this is one thing that has

01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:58.160
actually stood the test of some time. GPT-4 remains the best by a not insignificant margin,

01:39:59.120 --> 01:40:04.080
at least in terms of what the public has seen. And certainly, you know, is well ahead of any of

01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:08.640
the open source stuff. And a lot of the open source stuff too, it is worth noting, is kind of

01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:14.400
derivative of GPT-4. A lot of what people do when they train open source models. And by the way,

01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:19.040
I do this also, I'm not like knocking it as a technique, because it's a it's a good technique.

01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:26.160
But like at Waymark, when we train our script writing model, we find that using GPT-4 reasoning

01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:31.920
to train the lower power 3.5 or other, you know, could be open source as well,

01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:38.160
to train that lower power model on GPT-4 reasoning really improves the performance

01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:42.640
of the lower powered model. And that's a big part of the reason that people have been able to spin

01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:48.320
up the open source models as quickly as they have been able to, because they can use the most

01:40:48.320 --> 01:40:54.240
powerful model to get those examples, they don't have to go hand craft them. And that just saves,

01:40:54.240 --> 01:41:00.080
you know, orders of magnitude, time, energy, money, right? I mean, if you had to go do everything

01:41:00.080 --> 01:41:05.200
by hand, you'd be spending a lot of time and money doing that. GPT-4 is only, you know,

01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:10.240
a couple of cents per 1000 tokens. And so you can get, you know, tons of examples for again,

01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:17.520
just a few bucks or a few tens of bucks. And, you know, so even without open sourcing directly,

01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:23.520
they have really enabled open source development. But the moat really definitely for now,

01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:27.680
at least in terms of public stuff remains, right? We don't know what Anthropic has that

01:41:27.680 --> 01:41:33.680
is not released. We don't know what DeepMind has that is not released, or maybe soon to be released.

01:41:33.680 --> 01:41:40.560
So we may soon see something that comes out and exceeds what GPT-4 can do, but to have

01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:45.760
maintain that lead for eight months in public and a year and a quarter from the completion of

01:41:45.760 --> 01:41:54.000
training is definitely a significant accomplishment, which to me means we should not interpret them as

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:57.840
going for regulatory capture and instead should really just listen to what they're saying and

01:41:57.840 --> 01:42:03.600
interpret it much more earnestly. Is there anything else that Sam or opening I have done

01:42:03.680 --> 01:42:06.240
that that you've liked and have been kind of impressed by?

01:42:06.800 --> 01:42:13.680
Yeah, one thing I think is specifically going out of his way to question the narrative that

01:42:14.480 --> 01:42:18.160
China is going to do it no matter what we do. So we have no choice but to try to keep pace with

01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:24.160
China. He has said he has no idea what China is going to do. And he sees a lot of people talking

01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:27.040
like they know what China is going to do. And he doesn't really think they, you know,

01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:31.040
they're he thinks they're overconfident in their assessments of what China is going to do.

01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:35.840
And basically thinks we should make our own decisions independent of what China may or may

01:42:35.840 --> 01:42:40.720
not do. And I think that's really good. You know, I also, and I'm no China expert at all,

01:42:41.280 --> 01:42:46.880
but it's easy to have that kind of, you know, first of all, I just hate how adversarial

01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:53.520
our relationship with China has become. As you know, somebody who lives in the Midwest in the

01:42:53.520 --> 01:43:00.080
United States, like, I don't really see why we need to be in long term conflict with China. You

01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:05.920
know, like that, that to me would be a reflection of very bad leadership on at least one, if not

01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:11.040
both sides, if that, you know, continues to be the case for a long time to come. I think we

01:43:11.040 --> 01:43:15.520
should be able to get along. We're on opposite sides of the world. We don't really, you know,

01:43:15.520 --> 01:43:20.000
have to compete over much. And, you know, we, and we're both in like very secure positions. And

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:24.320
neither one of us is like really a threat to the other in like, in a way of, you know, taking

01:43:24.320 --> 01:43:27.920
over their country or something, or them, you know, coming in ruling us like it's not going to

01:43:27.920 --> 01:43:32.000
happen. Yeah, I mean, the most important, the reason why this shouldn't, this particular

01:43:32.560 --> 01:43:35.840
geopolitical setup shouldn't necessarily lead to war in the way that one's in the past have,

01:43:35.840 --> 01:43:41.600
is that the countries are so far away from one another and none of their core interests,

01:43:41.600 --> 01:43:46.240
their core like narrow national interests that they care the most about overlap in a really

01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:51.680
negative way, or they need not, if people play their cards right. There is just like no fundamental

01:43:51.680 --> 01:43:56.560
pressure that is forcing the US and China towards conflict. And I think, I mean, I don't know,

01:43:56.880 --> 01:44:00.800
that's my general take. And I think if you're right, that if our national leaders cannot

01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:05.680
lead us towards a path of peaceful coexistence, then we should be extremely disappointed in them

01:44:05.680 --> 01:44:09.440
and kick them out and replace them with someone who can. Sorry, I interrupted, carry on.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:14.960
Yeah, well, that's basically my view as well. And, you know, some may call it naive. But

01:44:15.760 --> 01:44:21.200
Sam Altman, I think too, in my view, to his significant credit, has specifically argued

01:44:21.200 --> 01:44:26.080
against the idea that we just have to do whatever because China's going to do whatever.

01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:31.840
And so I do give a lot of credit for that because it could easily be used as cover

01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:37.360
for him to do whatever he wants to do. And, you know, to specifically argue against it,

01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:44.880
to me is quite laudable. Yeah, no, that's super credible. I actually, I twigged. I guess I knew

01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:50.320
the fact that I hadn't heard that argument coming from Sam. But now that you mention it, it's

01:44:50.320 --> 01:44:54.960
outstanding that he has not, I think, fallen for that line or has not appropriated that line in

01:44:55.040 --> 01:44:59.440
order to get more slack for open AI to do what it wants, because it would be so easy,

01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:03.760
so easy even to convince yourself that it's a good argument and make that.

01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:09.520
So, yeah, super, super kudos to him. I think it's an argument that frustrates me a lot because I

01:45:09.520 --> 01:45:13.920
feel online, you see the very simple version, which is just, oh, you know, look, we might try to

01:45:13.920 --> 01:45:18.960
coordinate in order to slow things down, make things go better. But it's, you know, learn some

01:45:18.960 --> 01:45:24.880
game theory you dope. Of course, this is impossible because there's multiple actors who

01:45:24.880 --> 01:45:29.280
are racing against one another. And I'm like, you know, I actually did study game theory at

01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:35.200
university. And I think one of the less things that you learn pretty quickly is that a small

01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:40.560
number of actors with visibility into what the other actors are doing in a repeated game can

01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:46.000
coordinate famous result. And here we have not a very large number of actors who have access

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:50.640
to the necessary compute yet, at least. So, and hopefully we could maybe keep that the case.

01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:55.760
They all have a kind of shared interest in slowing things down if they can manage to coordinate it.

01:45:56.640 --> 01:46:01.120
For better or worse, information security is extremely poor in the current, in the world.

01:46:01.120 --> 01:46:04.720
So, in fact, there's a lot of visibility, even if a state were trying to keep secret what they

01:46:04.720 --> 01:46:09.600
were doing. Lord knows. Good luck. And also, it's extremely visible where machine learning

01:46:09.600 --> 01:46:16.320
researchers move. A lot of them suddenly move from one from Shanghai or San Francisco to some

01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:20.800
military base out somewhere. It's going to be a bit of a tell that something is going on.

01:46:21.920 --> 01:46:26.000
Yeah. And let's not forget how the Soviet Union got the bomb, right? Which is that they stole the

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:32.960
secrets from us. So, the same, you know, I don't think that's really, you know, I think China is

01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:40.240
very capable and they will make their own AI progress, for sure. But, you know, I don't,

01:46:40.240 --> 01:46:43.760
but they could, you know, if we were to race into developing it, then they might just steal it from

01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:49.280
us, you know, before they are able to develop their own. So, it's not like, I don't think they

01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:56.000
need to steal it from us to make their own progress. But the, you know, given how easy it is to hack

01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:02.560
most things, it certainly doesn't seem like us developing it is a way to keep it out. Is the

01:47:02.560 --> 01:47:05.920
surest way to keep it out of their hands or anything along those lines? Right, right, right.

01:47:05.920 --> 01:47:10.160
Yeah. So, that's a whole nother, another line of argument. But I'm not sure whether we can pull

01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:16.240
off, you know, really good coordination with China in order to buy ourselves and them the time that

01:47:16.240 --> 01:47:23.680
we would like to have to feel comfortable with deploying the cutting edge tools. But I certainly

01:47:23.680 --> 01:47:27.440
don't think it's obvious that we can't because of this issue that it's a repeated game with like

01:47:27.440 --> 01:47:34.160
reasonable visibility into what the other actors are doing. And it's just, like theory says that

01:47:34.160 --> 01:47:38.240
probably we should be able to coordinate. So, if we can't do it, it's for some more complicated

01:47:38.240 --> 01:47:43.440
subtle reasons or other things that are going on. And it feels, it's just, it's up to us, I think,

01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:46.720
whether we can, whether we can manage to make it work. And we should keep that in mind rather

01:47:46.720 --> 01:47:52.240
than just give up. Because we've learned, maybe we've done the very first class in game theory,

01:47:52.400 --> 01:47:55.040
learned the prisoner's dilemma. And that's where we stopped.

01:47:55.600 --> 01:48:02.080
Yeah. Yeah, I totally agree. I should find that clip and repost it. It wasn't like, you know,

01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:05.760
a super visible moment. But maybe it should be a little more visible.

01:48:06.400 --> 01:48:10.480
Yeah. Okay. So, that's a bunch of positive stuff about opening. Is there anything

01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:14.640
that ideally you would like to see them improve or change about how they're approaching all of

01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:20.560
this these days? Yeah, I think you could answer that big and also small. I think the biggest

01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:29.360
answer on that would be, let's maybe reexamine the quest for AGI before really going for it.

01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:35.440
You know, we're now in this kind of like base camp position, I would say, where we have

01:48:36.160 --> 01:48:45.360
GPT-4. I describe GPT-4 as human level, but not human like. That is to say, it can do most things

01:48:45.920 --> 01:48:53.680
better than most humans. It is closing in on expert capability. And especially for routine

01:48:53.680 --> 01:49:00.320
things, it is often comparable to experts. We're talking doctors, lawyers, for routine things where

01:49:00.320 --> 01:49:06.320
there is an established standard of care and established best practice. GPT-4 is often very

01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:12.720
competitive with experts. But it is not yet, at least not often at all, having these sort of

01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:19.040
breakthrough insights. So that's, in my mind, kind of a base camp for some sort of like final

01:49:19.040 --> 01:49:26.400
push to a truly superhuman AI. And how many breakthroughs we need before we would have

01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:32.080
something that is genuinely superhuman and the way they describe AGI is something that is able

01:49:32.080 --> 01:49:38.160
to do most economically valuable tasks better than humans. It's unclear how many breakthroughs

01:49:38.160 --> 01:49:42.800
we need, but it could be like one, maybe they already had it, it could be two, it could be three.

01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:47.200
It's like very hard to imagine it's more than three from where we currently are. So I do think

01:49:47.200 --> 01:49:55.520
we're in this kind of final summit part of this process. And one big observation too is,

01:49:56.240 --> 01:49:59.840
and I think I probably should emphasize this more in everything I do, I think there is a

01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:08.000
pretty clear divergence in how fast the capabilities are improving and how fast

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:13.440
our control measures are improving. The capabilities over the last couple of years

01:50:13.440 --> 01:50:20.640
seem to have improved much more than the controls. GPT-4, again, can code at a near human level.

01:50:20.640 --> 01:50:25.520
It can do things like, if you say to it with a certain setup and access to certain tools,

01:50:25.520 --> 01:50:30.640
if you say synthesize this chemical and you give it access to control via API,

01:50:30.640 --> 01:50:36.880
a chemical laboratory, it can often do that. It can look up things, it can issue the right commands.

01:50:36.880 --> 01:50:42.720
You can actually get a physical chemical at the other end of a laboratory just by prompting

01:50:43.280 --> 01:50:47.200
GPT-4, again, with some access to some information and the relevant APIs,

01:50:47.200 --> 01:50:50.560
to just say, just do it. And you can actually get a physical chemical at the other end,

01:50:50.560 --> 01:50:54.720
like that's crazy, right? These capabilities are going super fast. And meanwhile,

01:50:54.720 --> 01:50:58.880
the controls are not nearly as good, right? Oddly enough, it's kind of hardest

01:50:58.880 --> 01:51:05.680
to get it to be like, you know, let's say, violating of, you know, kind of dearly held

01:51:06.320 --> 01:51:09.920
social norms. So it's like, it's pretty hard to get it to be racist. It will like bend over

01:51:09.920 --> 01:51:16.560
backwards to be like very neutral on certain social topics. But things that are more subtle,

01:51:16.560 --> 01:51:22.160
like synthesizing chemicals or whatever, it's very easy most of the time to get it to kind of do

01:51:22.160 --> 01:51:30.240
whatever you want it to do, good or bad. And that divergence gives me a lot of pause.

01:51:30.240 --> 01:51:36.720
And I think it maybe should give them more pause too. Like, what is AGI, right? It is sort of a,

01:51:37.520 --> 01:51:42.400
it is a vision, it's not super well formed. People have, I think, a lot of different things in

01:51:42.400 --> 01:51:48.320
their imaginations when they try to conceive of what it might be like. But they've set out,

01:51:48.400 --> 01:51:52.960
and they've even updated their core values recently, which you can find on their careers page

01:51:52.960 --> 01:51:58.560
to say, and this is the first core value is AGI focus. And they basically say,

01:51:58.560 --> 01:52:03.280
we are building AGI. That's what we're doing. Everything we do is in service of that. Anything

01:52:03.280 --> 01:52:07.920
that's not in service of that is out of scope. And how we just say the number one thing I would

01:52:07.920 --> 01:52:14.480
really want them to do is reexamine that. Is it really wise, given the trajectory of

01:52:14.480 --> 01:52:20.320
developments of the control measures, to continue to pursue that goal right now

01:52:21.040 --> 01:52:27.760
with single-minded focus? I am not convinced of that at all. And I think they could perhaps have,

01:52:28.560 --> 01:52:31.760
rumor has it, and it's more than rumor, as Sam Altman has said, that the

01:52:31.760 --> 01:52:39.600
superalignment team will have their first result published soon. So I'll be very eager to read

01:52:39.920 --> 01:52:48.080
that and see. Possibly this trend will reverse. Possibly the progress will start to slow.

01:52:48.800 --> 01:52:54.400
Certainly, if it's just a matter of more and more scale, we're getting into the realm now where GPT-4

01:52:55.120 --> 01:53:01.200
is supposed to have cost $100 million. So in a log scale, you may need a billion,

01:53:01.200 --> 01:53:05.440
you may need $10 billion to get to that level. And that's not going to be easy,

01:53:05.440 --> 01:53:10.160
even with today's infrastructure. So maybe those capabilities will start to slow,

01:53:10.160 --> 01:53:13.040
and maybe they're going to have great results from the superalignment team,

01:53:13.040 --> 01:53:18.720
and we'll feel like we're on a much better relative footing between capabilities and control.

01:53:19.600 --> 01:53:24.720
But until that happens, I think the AGI single-minded, this is what we're doing,

01:53:24.720 --> 01:53:30.960
and everything else is out of scope, feels misguided to the point of, I would call it,

01:53:31.040 --> 01:53:39.680
ideological. It doesn't seem at all obvious that we should make something that is more

01:53:39.680 --> 01:53:45.760
powerful than humans at everything when we don't have a clear way to control it. So I mean,

01:53:45.760 --> 01:53:52.720
that to me is like, the whole premise does seem to be well worth a reexamination at this point.

01:53:52.720 --> 01:53:55.280
And without further evidence, I don't feel comfortable with that.

01:53:56.000 --> 01:54:01.520
Yeah, I think your point is not just that they should stop doing AI research in general. I

01:54:01.520 --> 01:54:05.520
think a point that you and I guess others have started to make now is what we want,

01:54:06.160 --> 01:54:11.360
and what you would think Open AI would want as a business is useful products, is products that

01:54:11.360 --> 01:54:16.960
people can use to improve their lives. And it's not obvious that you need to have a single model

01:54:16.960 --> 01:54:22.640
that is generally capable at all different activities simultaneously, and that maybe has

01:54:22.640 --> 01:54:27.840
a sense of agency and can pursue goals in a broader sense in order to come up with really

01:54:27.840 --> 01:54:32.000
useful products. Maybe you just want to have a series of many different models that are each

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:36.320
specialized in doing one particular kind of thing that we would find very useful,

01:54:36.320 --> 01:54:41.040
and we could stay in that state for a while with extremely useful, extremely economically productive,

01:54:41.040 --> 01:54:46.720
but nonetheless narrow models. We could continue to harvest the benefits of that for many years

01:54:46.720 --> 01:54:52.480
while we do all this kind of super alignment work to figure out, well, how can we put them all

01:54:52.480 --> 01:54:56.560
into a single model, a pretty simple model that is capable of doing across basically every

01:54:56.560 --> 01:55:00.880
dimension of activity that humans can engage in, and perhaps some that we can't. How do we do that

01:55:00.880 --> 01:55:06.480
while ensuring that things go well, which seems to have many unresolved questions around it?

01:55:07.040 --> 01:55:12.400
Yeah, I think that's right. And it doesn't come without cost. There definitely is something

01:55:13.360 --> 01:55:18.320
awesome about the single AI that can do everything. And again, I think we're in this kind of sweet

01:55:18.320 --> 01:55:24.560
spot with GPT-4 where it's crossed a lot of thresholds of usefulness, but it's not

01:55:24.560 --> 01:55:30.080
so powerful as to be super dangerous. I would like to see us kind of stay in that sweet spot

01:55:30.080 --> 01:55:36.720
for a while. And I do really enjoy the fact that I can just easily take any question to chat

01:55:36.720 --> 01:55:42.400
GPT now with the mobile app too on the phone, just to be able to talk to it. It's so simple.

01:55:43.840 --> 01:55:47.440
Whether from an end user perspective or an application developer perspective,

01:55:47.520 --> 01:55:53.760
there is something really awesome and undeniably so about the generality of the current systems.

01:55:53.760 --> 01:55:58.720
And that's really been, if you were to say, what is the difference between the AIs that we have now

01:55:58.720 --> 01:56:07.840
and the kind of AIs of, say, pre-2020, it really is generality that's the biggest change. You could

01:56:07.840 --> 01:56:13.200
also say maybe the generative nature. But those are kind of the two things. You used to have things

01:56:13.200 --> 01:56:20.240
that would solve very defined, very narrow problems, classification, sentiment analysis,

01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:28.240
boundary detection, these very kind of discrete, small problems. And they never really created

01:56:28.240 --> 01:56:35.200
anything new. They would more annotate things that existed. So what's new is that it can create new

01:56:35.200 --> 01:56:41.200
stuff and that it can kind of do it on anything, any arbitrary text. It will have some sort of

01:56:41.280 --> 01:56:47.280
decent response to. So that is awesome. And I definitely, I find it very easy for me and

01:56:47.280 --> 01:56:52.960
it's easy to empathize with the developers who are just like, man, this is so incredible and

01:56:52.960 --> 01:56:56.480
it's so awesome. How could we not want to continue? This is the coolest thing anyone's ever done.

01:56:56.480 --> 01:57:06.880
It is genuinely, right? So I'm very with that. But it could change quickly in a world where

01:57:07.600 --> 01:57:13.520
it is genuinely better at us than everything. And that is their stated goal. And I have found

01:57:14.320 --> 01:57:22.000
Sam Ultman's public statements to generally be pretty accurate and a pretty good guide to

01:57:22.640 --> 01:57:28.160
what the future will hold. I specifically tested that during the window between the

01:57:28.160 --> 01:57:33.360
GPT-4 Red Team and the GPT-4 Release because there was crazy speculation. He was making some,

01:57:34.320 --> 01:57:40.640
mostly kind of cryptic public comments during that window. But I found them to all be pretty

01:57:40.640 --> 01:57:48.640
accurate to what I had seen with GPT-4. So I think that we should, again, we should take them

01:57:48.640 --> 01:57:55.440
broadly at face value in terms of, certainly as we talked about before, their motivations on

01:57:55.440 --> 01:58:00.400
regulatory questions, but also in terms of what their goals are. And their stated goal very plainly

01:58:00.400 --> 01:58:06.080
is to make something that is more capable than humans at basically everything. And yeah, I just

01:58:06.080 --> 01:58:14.640
don't feel like the control measures are anywhere close to being in place for that to be a prudent

01:58:14.640 --> 01:58:20.480
move. And so yeah, I would just like to see your original question. What would I like to see them

01:58:20.480 --> 01:58:24.640
do differently? I think the biggest picture thing would be just continue to question that

01:58:25.840 --> 01:58:30.000
what I think could easily become an assumption and basically has become an assumption. If it's

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:33.680
a core value at this point for the company, then it doesn't seem like the kind of thing that's going

01:58:33.680 --> 01:58:39.360
to be questioned all that much. But I hope they do continue to question the wisdom of pursuing this

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:47.600
AGI vision immediately, especially as it's detached from, especially immediately and especially as

01:58:47.600 --> 01:58:51.040
detached from any particular problem that they're trying to solve.

01:58:51.600 --> 01:58:57.040
Okay. What's another thing that you'd love to see OpenAI adjust? We should make you feel a little

01:58:57.040 --> 01:59:00.640
bit more comfortable and a bit less nervous about where we're all at.

01:59:01.200 --> 01:59:06.800
I think it would be really helpful to have a better sense of just what they can and can't

01:59:06.800 --> 01:59:14.320
predict about what the next model can do. Just how successful were they in their predictions

01:59:14.320 --> 01:59:22.880
about GPT-4? For example, we know that there are scaling laws that show what the loss number is going

01:59:22.960 --> 01:59:30.880
to be pretty effectively. Even there, it's kind of like, well, with what data set exactly, and is

01:59:30.880 --> 01:59:36.480
there any curriculum learning aspect to that? Because you could definitely, and people are

01:59:36.480 --> 01:59:40.480
definitely developing all sorts of ways to change the composition of the data set over time.

01:59:41.040 --> 01:59:48.480
There's been some results even from OpenAI that show that pre-training on code first seems to help

01:59:48.480 --> 01:59:53.200
with logic and reasoning abilities, and then you can kind of go to a more general data set later.

01:59:53.200 --> 01:59:58.000
That's at least as I understand their published results. They've certainly said something like that.

02:00:00.720 --> 02:00:06.080
When you look at this loss curve, what exactly assumptions are baked into that,

02:00:06.080 --> 02:00:09.840
but then even more importantly, what does that mean? What can it do?

02:00:11.360 --> 02:00:16.400
How much confidence did they have? How accurate were they in their ability to predict what GPT-4

02:00:16.400 --> 02:00:20.800
was going to be able to do, and how accurate do they think they're going to be on the next one?

02:00:21.360 --> 02:00:26.400
There's been some conflicting messages about that. Greg Brockman recently posted something

02:00:26.400 --> 02:00:33.280
saying that they could do that, but Sam has said, and the GPT-4 technical report said that they

02:00:33.280 --> 02:00:40.480
really can't do that. When it comes to a particular will it or won't it be able to do this specific

02:00:40.480 --> 02:00:48.640
thing, they just don't know. This was a change for Greg, too, because at the launch of GPT-4

02:00:48.640 --> 02:00:55.840
in his keynote, he said that at OpenAI, we all have our favorite little task

02:00:56.560 --> 02:01:02.000
that the last version couldn't do, that we are looking to see if the new version can do.

02:01:02.800 --> 02:01:06.960
The reason they have to do that is because they just don't know. They're kind of crowdsourcing

02:01:06.960 --> 02:01:12.800
internally, like, hey, whose favorite task got solved this time around, and whose remains

02:01:12.800 --> 02:01:20.000
unsolved. That is something I would love to see them be more open about, the fact that they don't

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:23.760
really have great ability to do that. As far as I understand, if there has been a breakthrough

02:01:23.760 --> 02:01:28.320
there, by all means, we'd love to know that, too, but it seems like no, probably not.

02:01:29.200 --> 02:01:33.120
We're really still guessing, and that's exactly what Sam Altman just said about GPT-5. That's

02:01:33.120 --> 02:01:37.600
the fun little guessing game for us, quote, that was out of the Financial Times argument he said

02:01:37.600 --> 02:01:42.320
just straight up. I can't tell you what GPT-5 is going to be able to do that GPT-4 couldn't.

02:01:44.480 --> 02:01:50.320
That's a big question. That's for me, what is emergence? There's been a lot of debate around

02:01:50.320 --> 02:01:58.000
that, but for me, the most relevant definition of emergence is things that it can suddenly do

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:04.320
from one version to the next that you didn't expect. That's where I think a lot of the danger and

02:02:04.320 --> 02:02:10.400
uncertainty is. That is definitely something I would like to see them do better. I would also

02:02:10.400 --> 02:02:15.680
like to see them take a little bit more active role in interpreting research, generally. There's

02:02:15.680 --> 02:02:22.240
so much research going on around what it can and can't do. Some of it is pretty bad, and they don't

02:02:22.240 --> 02:02:25.680
really police that, or not that they should police it. That's too strong of a word, but

02:02:26.160 --> 02:02:31.520
correct, maybe. I would like to see them put out, or at least have their own position. That's a

02:02:31.520 --> 02:02:37.600
little bit more robust and a little bit more updated over time as compared to just right now,

02:02:37.600 --> 02:02:42.480
they put out the technical report, and it had a bunch of benchmarks, and then they've pretty much

02:02:42.480 --> 02:02:47.360
left it at that. With the new GPT-4 Turbo, they said, you should find it to be better,

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:52.800
but we didn't get, and maybe it'll still come. Maybe this also may shed a little light on the

02:02:53.200 --> 02:03:00.160
board dynamic, because they put a date on the calendar for Dev Day, and they invited people,

02:03:00.880 --> 02:03:06.000
and they were going to have their Dev Day. What we ended up with was a preview model

02:03:06.800 --> 02:03:10.960
that is not yet the final version. When I interviewed Logan, the developer relations

02:03:10.960 --> 02:03:15.840
lead on my podcast, he said, basically, what that means is it's not quite finished. It's

02:03:15.840 --> 02:03:20.480
not quite up to the usual standards that we have for these things. That's definitely

02:03:20.560 --> 02:03:25.120
departure from previous releases. They did not do that prior to this event, as far as I know.

02:03:26.880 --> 02:03:30.400
They were still talking like, let's release early, but let's release when it's ready.

02:03:30.400 --> 02:03:35.520
Now they're releasing kind of admittedly before it's ready, and we also don't have any sort of

02:03:35.520 --> 02:03:44.480
comprehensive evaluation of how does this compare to the last GPT-4. We only know that it's cheaper,

02:03:44.480 --> 02:03:50.880
that it has longer context window, that it is faster, but in terms of what it can and can't do

02:03:50.880 --> 02:03:58.880
compared to the last one, you should find it to be generally better. I would love to see more

02:03:58.880 --> 02:04:07.120
thorough characterization of their own product from them as well, because it's so weird. These

02:04:07.120 --> 02:04:14.400
things are so weird, and part of why I think people do go off the rails on characterizing

02:04:14.960 --> 02:04:21.440
models is that if you're not really, really trying to understand what they can and can't do,

02:04:22.160 --> 02:04:28.000
it's very easy to get some result and content yourself with that. I won't call anyone out at

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:35.040
this moment, but there are some pretty well-known Twitter commenters who I've had some back and

02:04:35.040 --> 02:04:41.840
forth with who will say, oh, look at this, GPT-4 blowing it again. In the most flagrant form

02:04:41.840 --> 02:04:45.440
of this, you go in and just try it, and it's like, no, I don't know where you got that, but it does,

02:04:45.440 --> 02:04:52.560
in fact, do that correctly. In some cases, it's just like, don't be totally wrong, go try it

02:04:52.560 --> 02:04:58.880
before you repost somebody else's thing. That's the superficial way to be wrong. The more subtle

02:04:58.880 --> 02:05:05.200
thing is that because they have such different strengths and weaknesses from humans, there are

02:05:05.200 --> 02:05:10.960
things that they can do that are remarkably good, but then if you perturb or they're gullible,

02:05:11.840 --> 02:05:17.440
that's an ethanmolic term, which I really come to appreciate, they're easy to trick.

02:05:17.440 --> 02:05:26.000
They're easy to throw off. They're not adversarily robust. They have high potential

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:30.880
performance, and if you set them up with good context and good surrounding structure and it's

02:05:30.880 --> 02:05:37.040
in the context of an application, they can work great, but then if you try to mess them up,

02:05:37.040 --> 02:05:41.680
you can mess them up. It's very easy to generate both these like, wow, look at this amazing

02:05:42.560 --> 02:05:48.720
performance, rivaling human expert, maybe even surpassing it in some cases, but then also,

02:05:49.360 --> 02:05:56.080
look how badly it's fumbling these super simple things. If you have an agenda,

02:05:56.080 --> 02:06:00.880
it's not that hard to come up with the GBD-4 examples to support that agenda.

02:06:01.840 --> 02:06:07.040
I think that's another reason that I think it is really important to just have people focused on

02:06:07.600 --> 02:06:12.320
the most comprehensive, wide-ranging, and accurate understanding of what they can do

02:06:13.360 --> 02:06:20.880
as possible because so many people have an argument that they want to make, and it is

02:06:20.880 --> 02:06:26.320
just way too easy to find examples that support any given argument, but that does not really

02:06:26.320 --> 02:06:33.440
mean that the argument ultimately holds. It just means that you can find GBD-4 examples for kind

02:06:33.440 --> 02:06:40.320
of anything. That's a tough dynamic, right? It's very confusing, and again, it's human level,

02:06:40.320 --> 02:06:48.960
but it's not human-like. We're much more adversarily robust than the AIs are, and so we kind of assume

02:06:48.960 --> 02:06:53.200
that like- If they mess up when they're given a question that's kind of designed to make them

02:06:53.200 --> 02:06:57.760
mess up, then they must be dumb, right? Yeah, then they must be dumb, right? Yeah. Only a real

02:06:57.760 --> 02:07:05.440
idiot, only a real human idiot would fall for that. It's funny, anthropomorphizing too. AI,

02:07:05.440 --> 02:07:08.480
it defies all binaries, right? One of the things I used to say pretty confidently is

02:07:08.480 --> 02:07:13.360
anthropomorphizing is bad. There have been enough examples now where anthropomorphizing

02:07:13.360 --> 02:07:20.160
can lead to better performance that you can't say definitively now anymore that anthropomorphizing

02:07:20.160 --> 02:07:25.600
is all bad. It sometimes can give you intuitions that can be helpful. There have been some

02:07:25.600 --> 02:07:32.640
interesting examples of using emotional language to improve performance. Even anthropomorphizing

02:07:32.640 --> 02:07:37.920
is back on the table in some respect, but I do think still on net, it's something to be

02:07:37.920 --> 02:07:43.440
very, very cautious of because these things just have very different strengths and weaknesses

02:07:43.440 --> 02:07:49.920
from us. Their profile is just ultimately not that- It's quite different from ours.

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:56.960
Human language. Coming back to the question of areas where OpenAI looks better with the

02:07:56.960 --> 02:08:02.800
benefit of hindsight, back in like 2022 when chat GPT was coming out and then GPT-4,

02:08:02.800 --> 02:08:07.840
I must admit, I was not myself convinced that releasing those models was such a good move

02:08:07.840 --> 02:08:12.560
for the world or things considered. The basic reasoning just being that it seemed pretty clear

02:08:12.560 --> 02:08:17.600
that those releases were doing a lot to boost spending on capabilities advances. They really

02:08:17.680 --> 02:08:23.120
brought AI to the attention of investors and scientists all around the world. Bit businesses

02:08:23.120 --> 02:08:28.160
everywhere. I guess they also set a precedent for releasing very capable foundation models

02:08:28.160 --> 02:08:31.600
fairly quickly, deploying them fairly quickly to the public. Not as quickly as you could be,

02:08:31.600 --> 02:08:37.360
because they did hold on to GPT-4 for a fair while, but still they could have held back for

02:08:37.360 --> 02:08:42.160
quite a lot longer if they wanted to. I think both of us have actually warmed the idea that

02:08:42.160 --> 02:08:47.280
releasing chat GPT and then GPT-4 around the time that they were released has maybe been for the

02:08:47.280 --> 02:08:53.840
best. Back in August, you mentioned to me, given web scale compute and web scale data,

02:08:53.840 --> 02:08:57.120
it was only a matter of time before somebody found a workable algorithm and in practice it

02:08:57.120 --> 02:09:00.960
didn't take that long at all. Now looking forward, I'm increasingly convinced that compute

02:09:00.960 --> 02:09:05.600
overhangs are a real issue. This doesn't mean that we shouldn't be conscious of avoiding

02:09:05.600 --> 02:09:09.760
needless acceleration, but what used to seem like a self-serving argument by OpenAI

02:09:09.760 --> 02:09:15.520
now seems more likely than not to be right. Can you elaborate on that? Because I think

02:09:15.520 --> 02:09:20.640
I've had a similar trajectory in becoming more sympathetic to the idea that it could be a bad

02:09:20.640 --> 02:09:26.080
move to hold back on revealing capabilities for a significant period of time, although that has

02:09:26.080 --> 02:09:31.760
some benefits that the costs are also quite substantial. I think there's a couple layers

02:09:31.760 --> 02:09:38.640
to this. One is maybe just unpack the technical side of it a little bit more first. There's

02:09:38.720 --> 02:09:46.480
basically three inputs to AI. There's the data, which contains all the information from which

02:09:46.480 --> 02:09:51.040
the learning is going to happen. There's the compute, which actually crunches all the numbers

02:09:51.040 --> 02:09:57.360
and gradually figures out what are the 70 billion or the 185 billion or the however many

02:09:57.360 --> 02:10:01.360
billion parameters. What are all those numbers going to be? That takes a lot of compute.

02:10:01.920 --> 02:10:07.040
And then the thing that stirs those together and makes it work is an algorithm.

02:10:07.840 --> 02:10:14.640
By what means, by what actual process are we going to crunch through all this data and actually

02:10:14.640 --> 02:10:22.400
do the learning? And I think what has become pretty clear to me over time is that neither the

02:10:22.400 --> 02:10:28.320
human brain nor the transformer are the end of history. These are certainly the best things that

02:10:28.320 --> 02:10:36.160
nature and that machine learning researchers have found to date, but neither one is an absolute

02:10:36.240 --> 02:10:42.880
terminal optimum point in the development of learning systems. And I think that's

02:10:42.880 --> 02:10:48.960
clear for probably a few reasons. One is that the transformer is pretty simple. It's not like a super

02:10:48.960 --> 02:10:54.880
complicated architecture. You can certainly imagine also, and we're starting to see many

02:10:54.880 --> 02:10:59.760
little variations on it already, but you can certainly imagine a better architecture. You

02:10:59.760 --> 02:11:03.360
just look at it and you're like, wow, this is pretty simple. You look at a lot of things that

02:11:03.360 --> 02:11:09.680
are working and you're like, wow, we're still in the early tinkering phase of this. It's really

02:11:09.680 --> 02:11:18.720
not many lines of code. If you were to just go look at how a transformer is defined in Python code,

02:11:20.320 --> 02:11:26.640
as with anything in computer science, there are many levels of abstraction between that

02:11:26.640 --> 02:11:32.720
Python code that you're writing and the actual computation on the chip. So it's not to say that

02:11:32.720 --> 02:11:41.360
the entire tower of computing infrastructure is simple, quite the contrary. But at the level

02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:49.360
where the architecture is defined, it is really not many lines of code required at this point.

02:11:49.360 --> 02:11:56.240
So that I think gives a sense for how at a high level, we now have this ability to manipulate

02:11:56.240 --> 02:12:03.360
and explore this architectural space. And you see something that can be defined in not that many

02:12:03.360 --> 02:12:10.080
lines of code that is so powerful. It's like, surely there's a lot more here that can be

02:12:10.640 --> 02:12:14.080
discovered. I don't have an exact number of lines of code, obviously different implementations would

02:12:14.080 --> 02:12:22.240
be different. But you see some things that are extremely few. I think the smallest implementations

02:12:22.240 --> 02:12:30.880
are probably under 50 lines of code. And that's just, that's so little, right? That it's just like

02:12:30.880 --> 02:12:37.840
kind of a, for me, an arresting realization that this is for all the power that it has,

02:12:37.840 --> 02:12:44.720
for all the complexity that has been required to build up to this level of abstraction and make it

02:12:44.720 --> 02:12:50.560
all possible. It is still a pretty simple thing at the end of the day that is powering so much of

02:12:50.640 --> 02:12:56.960
this. This does not feel like refined technology yet. One moment that really stood out to me there

02:12:56.960 --> 02:13:03.920
was the Flamingo paper from DeepMind, which was one of the first integrated vision, a multimodal

02:13:03.920 --> 02:13:09.120
but vision and tech systems where you could feed it an image and it could tell you, you know, like

02:13:09.120 --> 02:13:15.120
very good, you know, kind of holistic understanding detail about that image. You look at the architecture

02:13:15.120 --> 02:13:21.920
of that and it really looked more like a hobbyist soldering things together, you know, kind of

02:13:21.920 --> 02:13:27.360
post hoc and just like kind of Frankensteining and finding out, oh, look, it works. Not to say that it

02:13:27.360 --> 02:13:33.760
was totally simple, but like this did not look like a revolutionary insight, you know, it looked

02:13:33.760 --> 02:13:37.360
like, oh, let's just try kind of stitching this in here and whatever and run it and see if it works

02:13:37.360 --> 02:13:42.800
and, you know, sure enough, it worked. We're also seeing now too that other architectures from the

02:13:42.800 --> 02:13:49.920
past are being scaled up and are in some increasingly, you know, increasingly more and more contexts

02:13:49.920 --> 02:13:55.840
are competitive with transformers. So just all things considered, it seems like

02:13:56.560 --> 02:14:02.080
when you have the data and you have the compute, there are many algorithms probably over time that

02:14:02.080 --> 02:14:09.040
we will find that can work. We have found one so far and, you know, we're increasingly starting to

02:14:09.120 --> 02:14:14.320
tinker around with both refinements and, you know, just scaling up other ones that had been developed

02:14:14.320 --> 02:14:20.880
in the past and finding that multiple things can work. So it seems like this scale is in some sense

02:14:20.880 --> 02:14:25.920
genuinely all you need. People will say scale is not all you need. And I think that's like both true

02:14:25.920 --> 02:14:31.040
and not true, right? I think the scale is all you need in terms of preconditions. And then you do

02:14:31.040 --> 02:14:36.720
need some insights. But if you just study the architecture of the transformer, you're like,

02:14:36.720 --> 02:14:43.600
man, it is pretty simple in the end. You know, it's kind of a single block with a few different

02:14:43.600 --> 02:14:50.560
components. They repeat that block a bunch of times. And it works. So the fact that something

02:14:50.560 --> 02:14:57.280
that simple can work just suggests to me that, you know, we're not at the end of history here

02:14:57.280 --> 02:15:04.160
in AI or probably anywhere close to it. So if that's the case, then I strongly update

02:15:04.160 --> 02:15:10.800
to believe that this is kind of inevitable. I've been saying Kurzweil's revenge for a while now

02:15:10.800 --> 02:15:17.360
because he basically charted this out in like the late 90s and just put this, you know, continuation

02:15:17.360 --> 02:15:23.280
of Moore's law on a curve. Now today, if you put that side by side, I have a slide like this in my

02:15:23.280 --> 02:15:29.920
AI scouting report, you put that late 90s graph from Kurzweil right next to a graph of how big

02:15:29.920 --> 02:15:36.400
actual models that have been trained were over time, they look very similar. And right around now

02:15:36.400 --> 02:15:40.560
was the time that Kurzweil had projected that AIs would get to about human level.

02:15:41.280 --> 02:15:47.440
And it's like another 10 years or so before it gets to all of human level. So, you know, we'll see,

02:15:47.440 --> 02:15:54.080
right, exactly how many more years that may take. But it does feel like the with the raw materials

02:15:54.080 --> 02:15:59.120
there, somebody's going to unlock it. That's kind of my that's become my default position.

02:15:59.120 --> 02:16:07.600
So if you believe that, then early releases, getting people exposed, you know, starting to find out

02:16:07.600 --> 02:16:12.800
with less powerful systems, what's going to happen, what could go wrong, what kind of misuse and abuse

02:16:12.800 --> 02:16:19.280
are people in fact going to try to do. I think all of those things start to make a lot more sense.

02:16:19.280 --> 02:16:23.840
If you really believed that you could just look away and nothing bad would happen,

02:16:24.560 --> 02:16:29.360
then or nothing would happen at all, good or bad, then you might say, that's what you should do.

02:16:29.920 --> 02:16:35.520
But it seems like, you know, there's a lot of people out there, there's a lot of universities

02:16:35.520 --> 02:16:40.160
out there, there's a lot of researchers out there, and the raw material is there. So somebody,

02:16:40.160 --> 02:16:44.400
if you if you do believe that somebody's going to come along and catalyze those and make something

02:16:44.400 --> 02:16:52.240
that works, then I think it is there is a lot of wisdom to saying, let's see what happens with,

02:16:52.240 --> 02:16:55.360
you know, systems that are as powerful as we can create today, but not as powerful as what we'll

02:16:55.360 --> 02:17:01.920
have in the future. And let's figure out, you know, what can we learn from those? A good example of

02:17:01.920 --> 02:17:07.680
this that I didn't mention in the other episode, but is a good example of OpenAI doing this,

02:17:07.680 --> 02:17:17.600
is that they launched ChatGPT with 3.5, even though they had GPT-4 complete at that point.

02:17:18.400 --> 02:17:25.680
So why did they do that? I think that the reason is pretty clearly that they wanted to

02:17:25.680 --> 02:17:31.120
see what would happen and see what problems may arise before putting their most powerful model

02:17:31.120 --> 02:17:36.160
into the hands of the public. And they're probably feeling at that time like, man,

02:17:36.720 --> 02:17:40.320
we're starting to have an overhang here, you know, we now have something that is like,

02:17:40.880 --> 02:17:45.040
as I call it human level, but not human like, the public hasn't seen that the public hasn't

02:17:45.040 --> 02:17:49.840
really seen anything. The public hasn't really, you know, aside from a few early adopters,

02:17:49.840 --> 02:17:55.520
as of a year ago, very few people had used this technology at all in a hands-on, personal way.

02:17:56.160 --> 02:18:02.880
So how do we start to get people aware of this? How do we start to, you know, see where it can

02:18:02.880 --> 02:18:07.600
be really useful? How do we start to see where people are going to try to abuse it? And how do

02:18:07.600 --> 02:18:12.800
we do that in the most responsible way possible? So they launched this kind of intermediate thing

02:18:12.800 --> 02:18:18.000
almost really in between. It was like, if you took the end of GPT-4 training and the actual

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:23.760
GPT-4 launch, the 3.5 chat GPT release was like right, you know, almost 50% in between those.

02:18:24.400 --> 02:18:30.240
And I think that does show a very thoughtful approach to how do we let people kind of climb

02:18:30.240 --> 02:18:36.160
this technology curve in the most gradual way possible so that hopefully we can learn what

02:18:36.160 --> 02:18:41.280
we need to know and apply those lessons to the more powerful systems that are to come.

02:18:41.280 --> 02:18:47.200
Again, none of that is to say that this is going to be an adequate approach to the apparently,

02:18:47.200 --> 02:18:53.280
you know, continuing exponential development of everything. But it is at least, I think,

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:58.080
better than the alternative, which would be, you know, just not doing anything. And then all

02:18:58.080 --> 02:19:02.240
of a sudden, somebody has some crazy breakthrough. And, you know, that could be way more disruptive.

02:19:02.800 --> 02:19:08.720
It might be the best we can do, basically. Yeah. I don't have a much better solution at

02:19:08.720 --> 02:19:13.760
this point anyway. So you mentioned that the transformer architecture is relatively

02:19:14.400 --> 02:19:18.160
simple. It's probably nowhere near the best architecture that we could conceivably come

02:19:18.160 --> 02:19:23.920
up with. And other alternatives that people have thought are maybe in the past, when you apply

02:19:23.920 --> 02:19:27.440
the same level of compute and data to them, they also perform reasonably well, which suggests that

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:31.920
maybe there's nothing so special about that architecture exactly. What is it about that

02:19:31.920 --> 02:19:36.480
that makes you think we need to follow this track of continuing to release capabilities

02:19:36.480 --> 02:19:41.600
as they come online? I mean, I guess the basic part of that model is what determines what is

02:19:41.600 --> 02:19:46.880
possible to do with AI at any point in time is the amount of compute in the world and the amount

02:19:46.880 --> 02:19:53.760
of data that we've collected in order for the purposes of training. And if you just, if the

02:19:53.760 --> 02:19:58.480
chips are out there and the data is out there, but you don't release the model, that capability is

02:19:58.480 --> 02:20:03.680
always latent. It's always possible for someone to just turn around and apply it and then have

02:20:03.680 --> 02:20:09.040
a model that's substantially more powerful than what people realized was going to be possible today

02:20:09.040 --> 02:20:13.120
and is substantially more possible than anything that we have experience with. So to some extent,

02:20:13.120 --> 02:20:17.120
we're cursed or blessed, depending on how you look at it, to just have to continue releasing

02:20:17.120 --> 02:20:23.440
things as they come so that we can stay abreast of what, not what exists, but what is one step

02:20:23.440 --> 02:20:28.000
away from existing at any given point in time. But why is it that the relatively straightforwardness

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:33.520
of the transformer makes that case seem stronger to you? Because it just seems like it's so

02:20:33.520 --> 02:20:39.920
easy to stumble on something. And all of these things are growing, the data has been growing

02:20:40.480 --> 02:20:45.440
pretty much exponentially or something like exponentially for the lifespan of the internet,

02:20:45.440 --> 02:20:49.680
just how much data is uploaded to YouTube every second or whatever. These things are also

02:20:50.240 --> 02:20:54.880
massive and everybody's got the phone in their hand at all times. So video itself is going

02:20:55.440 --> 02:21:00.880
exponential and the chips are going exponential and that's been the case for years. And it's

02:21:00.880 --> 02:21:06.320
been kind of accelerated by other trends like gaming was kind of where GPUs and at least like

02:21:06.320 --> 02:21:10.720
graphics kind of rendering is where GPUs originally came from. But gaming is a big driver of why

02:21:10.720 --> 02:21:16.080
people wanted to have good GPUs on their home computers that had nothing to do with AI originally.

02:21:16.080 --> 02:21:22.720
It was kind of a repurposing of GPUs into AI. As I understood it, somewhat led by like the field

02:21:22.720 --> 02:21:27.360
even more so than the GPU developers, although they latched onto it and have certainly doubled

02:21:27.360 --> 02:21:35.440
down on it. And then you also had crypto driving a big demand for GPUs and just increasing like the

02:21:35.440 --> 02:21:41.440
physical capital investment to produce all the GPUs. So all these things are just happening.

02:21:41.440 --> 02:21:46.320
That background context is there. And I guess I should say I'm kind of making a counter argument

02:21:46.320 --> 02:21:51.920
to the argument against release, which would be that you're just further accelerating. Any

02:21:51.920 --> 02:21:57.120
demonstration of these powers will just inspire more people to pile on. It'll make it more

02:21:57.120 --> 02:22:00.480
competitive. All the big tech companies are going to get in, all the big countries are going to get

02:22:00.480 --> 02:22:09.120
in and therefore better to keep it quiet. I think the counter argument that I'm making there is

02:22:10.080 --> 02:22:15.120
all these background trends are happening regardless of whether you show off the capability or not.

02:22:15.120 --> 02:22:22.320
And so the compute overhang is very, very real. And then the simplicity of the architecture means

02:22:22.320 --> 02:22:30.400
that you really shouldn't bet on nobody finding anything good for very long. And also you can

02:22:30.400 --> 02:22:36.400
just look at the relatively short history and say, how long did it take to find something

02:22:37.120 --> 02:22:44.480
really good? And the answer is not that long. Depending on exactly where you date, at what

02:22:44.480 --> 02:22:48.880
level of compute did we have enough compute? At what level of data did we have enough data?

02:22:48.880 --> 02:22:55.120
You can kind of start the clock at a few different years perhaps in time. But I'm old enough to

02:22:55.120 --> 02:23:00.320
remember when the internet was just getting started, I'm old enough to have downloaded a song on Napster

02:23:00.320 --> 02:23:06.080
and have it taken a half an hour or whatever. So it's not been that long where it was definitely

02:23:06.080 --> 02:23:12.320
not there. And sometime between say 2000 and present, you would have to start the clock and say,

02:23:12.320 --> 02:23:17.680
okay, at this point in time, we probably had enough of the raw materials to where somebody

02:23:17.680 --> 02:23:22.320
could figure something out. And then when did people figure something out? Well, transformers

02:23:22.320 --> 02:23:29.440
were 2017. And over the course of the last few years, they've been refined and scaled up,

02:23:29.440 --> 02:23:33.040
honestly, not refined that much. Like the architecture isn't that different from the

02:23:33.040 --> 02:23:39.680
original transformer. Why has the transformer been so dominant? Because it's been working

02:23:39.680 --> 02:23:44.320
and it's continued to work. I think if there were no transformer or if the transformer were

02:23:44.400 --> 02:23:49.840
somehow magically made illegal, and you could not do a transformer anymore for whatever reason,

02:23:50.400 --> 02:23:53.680
I don't think it would be that long. Everybody would then say, well, what else can we find?

02:23:54.240 --> 02:23:58.240
And is there something else that can work comparably? And I don't think it would be that hard

02:23:58.240 --> 02:24:04.400
for the field to kind of recover even from a total banning of the transformer. I mean,

02:24:04.400 --> 02:24:10.000
that's kind of a ridiculous hypothetical because where you draw the line, what exactly are you

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:14.640
banning there in this in this fictional scenario, whatever, a lot of a lot of things are not super

02:24:14.640 --> 02:24:20.400
well defined in that. But if you'll play along with it and just imagine that all of a sudden

02:24:20.400 --> 02:24:26.000
everybody's like, shit, we got to find something new, we need a new algorithm to unlock this value.

02:24:26.560 --> 02:24:31.680
I just don't think it would be that long before somebody would find something comparable. And

02:24:31.680 --> 02:24:35.680
arguably, you know, they already have and arguably they already have found stuff better. There are

02:24:35.680 --> 02:24:41.600
candidates for transformer successors already. They haven't quite proven out yet. They haven't

02:24:41.600 --> 02:24:47.040
quite scaled yet. And to some degree, they haven't attracted the attention of the field

02:24:47.040 --> 02:24:52.080
because the transformer continues to work. And like just doing more with transformers has been a

02:24:52.080 --> 02:24:57.680
pretty safe bet. When you look at how many people are putting out how many research papers a year,

02:24:57.680 --> 02:25:02.560
you look at like the CVs of people in machine learning PhDs, and you're like, you're on a paper

02:25:02.560 --> 02:25:06.240
every two months. You know, this is not like when I was in chemistry way back in the day,

02:25:06.240 --> 02:25:11.440
the reason I didn't stay in chemistry was because it was slow going. It was a slog.

02:25:11.440 --> 02:25:16.400
And we and discoveries were not quick and not easy to come by. And the results that we did get

02:25:16.400 --> 02:25:20.640
were like seemingly way less impactful, way more incremental than what you're seeing now,

02:25:20.640 --> 02:25:25.680
certainly out of AI. So I have the sense that most of the things that people set out to do

02:25:26.640 --> 02:25:33.200
do in fact work. And because they just, you know, they just keep mining this like super rich vein

02:25:33.200 --> 02:25:38.480
of progress via the transformer. But again, if that were to close down, I think we would

02:25:39.040 --> 02:25:43.840
quickly find that we could like switch over to another track and, you know, have pretty similar

02:25:43.840 --> 02:25:51.040
progress ultimately. Yeah. So one reason that I've warmed to the idea that it was a Caterillist

02:25:51.040 --> 02:25:56.400
GPT-4, and probably maybe even a good thing is, so you're judging towards that there's this

02:25:56.400 --> 02:26:02.640
graph that they've shown me of the uptick in papers focused on AI over the years getting

02:26:02.640 --> 02:26:08.480
post to archive relative to other papers. And I mean, it has been exploding for some time. It has

02:26:08.480 --> 02:26:13.120
been on an exponential growth curve, possibly a super exponential growth curve. I can't tell

02:26:13.120 --> 02:26:19.680
just just just eyeballing it. But and this is all before GPT-4. So it seems like people in the know

02:26:19.680 --> 02:26:26.000
in ML, people in the field were aware of there was an enormous potential here. And there was,

02:26:26.560 --> 02:26:32.480
you know, GPT-4 coming out or not was probably not the decisive question for people who are

02:26:33.600 --> 02:26:37.360
in the discipline. No, it was the thing that brought it to our attention or brought it to

02:26:37.360 --> 02:26:41.600
the general public's attention. But I think that suggests that simply not released in GPT-4

02:26:41.600 --> 02:26:44.560
probably wouldn't have made that much difference to how much professional computer scientists

02:26:44.560 --> 02:26:49.200
appreciated that there was something very important happening in their field.

02:26:49.200 --> 02:26:53.920
And then on the other hand, there has been I think an explosion of, well, there's been

02:26:53.920 --> 02:26:57.760
explosion of progress and capabilities. There's also been an explosion of progress and certainly

02:26:57.760 --> 02:27:02.480
interest and discussion of the policy issues, the governance issues, the alignment issues

02:27:03.040 --> 02:27:08.560
that we have to confront. And I guess one of them is starting very far behind the other one.

02:27:09.920 --> 02:27:15.840
The capabilities are, you know, 100x, where I feel the understanding of governance and policy

02:27:15.840 --> 02:27:20.960
and alignment is. Nonetheless, I think there might have been a greater proportional increase in

02:27:21.760 --> 02:27:25.840
the progress or the rate of progress on those other issues because they're starting from such a

02:27:25.840 --> 02:27:30.000
low base. There's so much low hanging fruit that one can grab. And there's also people who were

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:35.840
trained in ML were kind of all working on this already. It's a relatively slow process to train

02:27:35.840 --> 02:27:41.600
new ML students in order to grow the entire field and to create new, you know, outstanding

02:27:41.680 --> 02:27:46.560
research scientists that open AI can hire. But there was, there were a lot of people with

02:27:46.560 --> 02:27:51.840
relevant expertise who could contribute to something to the governance or safety or alignment

02:27:51.840 --> 02:27:54.640
questions. Certainly on the policy side, there were a lot of people who could be brought in

02:27:55.200 --> 02:27:59.280
who weren't working on anything AI related because they just didn't think it was very important

02:27:59.280 --> 02:28:02.640
because it wasn't on their radar whatsoever. You know, this wasn't, it wasn't a big

02:28:03.280 --> 02:28:06.400
discussion. It wasn't a big topic in Congress. It wasn't a big topic in DC

02:28:07.040 --> 02:28:12.960
back in 2021. Whereas now it's a huge topic of discussion and far more personnel is going

02:28:12.960 --> 02:28:16.480
into trying to answer these questions or figure out what could we do in the meantime,

02:28:16.480 --> 02:28:20.000
so that we can buy ourselves enough time in order to be able to answer these questions.

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:24.240
So I think the story that, Open AI could have said the story, we need to put this out there

02:28:24.240 --> 02:28:29.200
to wake up the world so that people who are working in political science, people who work

02:28:29.200 --> 02:28:33.440
in international relations, people who write laws can start figuring out how the hell do

02:28:33.440 --> 02:28:37.920
we adapt to this? And if we just hold off on this, you know, releasing GPT-4 for another year

02:28:37.920 --> 02:28:42.080
or chat GPT for another year, it's going to be another year of progress, of like underlying

02:28:42.080 --> 02:28:46.880
latent progress in what Emma models are like one step away from being able to do without

02:28:47.600 --> 02:28:53.680
the government being aware that they have this dynamite, you know, scientific explosion on their

02:28:53.680 --> 02:28:59.520
hands that they have to deal with. So in my mind, that looms very large in why I feel like in some

02:28:59.520 --> 02:29:05.200
ways things have gone reasonably well over the last year. And to some extent, we have Open AI to

02:29:05.200 --> 02:29:08.880
thank for that. I'm not sure that, you know, people could give arguments on the other side,

02:29:08.880 --> 02:29:11.440
but I think this would be that would be the case in favor that resonates with me.

02:29:12.560 --> 02:29:17.840
Yeah, I agree with it. I think it resonates with me too. And I guess, you know, I also maybe just

02:29:17.840 --> 02:29:24.240
want to give voice for a second to the just general upside of the technology. I think what the Open

02:29:24.240 --> 02:29:32.240
AI people probably first and foremost think about is just the straightforward benefits to people

02:29:32.240 --> 02:29:38.880
that having access to something like GPT-4 can bring. And, you know, I find that to be

02:29:39.840 --> 02:29:44.320
very meaningful in my own personal life, you know, just as somebody who creates software,

02:29:44.320 --> 02:29:51.360
it helps me so much. I am probably three times faster at creating any software project that I

02:29:51.360 --> 02:30:00.400
want to create because I can get assistance from GPT-4. I get so many good answers to questions.

02:30:00.400 --> 02:30:04.560
It's not just GPT-4. I'm a huge fan of perplexity as well for getting, you know, hard to answer

02:30:04.560 --> 02:30:11.200
questions answered. So it really does make a tangible impact in a very positive way on people's

02:30:11.200 --> 02:30:20.960
lives. You know, we are, I certainly am speak for myself, very privileged in that I have access to

02:30:21.600 --> 02:30:26.880
expertise. I have my own, you know, personal wherewithal, which is decent at least. And I have,

02:30:26.880 --> 02:30:30.560
you know, a good network of people who have expertise in a lot of different areas. And I

02:30:30.560 --> 02:30:37.200
have money that I can, you know, spend when I need expertise. And so many people do not have that.

02:30:37.920 --> 02:30:43.440
And really suffer for it, I think. You know, I've told a story on my podcast once about a

02:30:43.440 --> 02:30:47.040
kind of friend of a friend who was in some legal trouble and needed some help and really couldn't

02:30:47.040 --> 02:30:52.000
afford a lawyer and was getting some really terrible advice, I think, from somebody in their

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:55.920
network who was trying to play lawyer. I didn't think this person was a lawyer. I mean, it was kind

02:30:55.920 --> 02:31:02.480
of a mess. But I took that problem to GPT-4. And I was like, look, I'm not a lawyer, but I can ask AI

02:31:02.480 --> 02:31:08.000
about this question for you. And, you know, it was, it gave a pretty definitive answer actually

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:12.240
that like, yeah, the advice that you're giving me or, you know, that you're putting in here does not

02:31:12.240 --> 02:31:18.240
seem like good advice. So confirming my suspicions. I've done that for medical stuff as well. You

02:31:18.240 --> 02:31:24.720
know, there, I had, we had one incident in our family where my wife was in fact satisfied that

02:31:24.720 --> 02:31:29.200
we didn't need to go to the doctor for one of our kids' issues because GPT-4 had kind of reassured

02:31:29.200 --> 02:31:36.480
us that it didn't sound like a big deal. So, you know, for a lot of people that expense, you know,

02:31:36.480 --> 02:31:41.840
is really meaningful. And I think it is just, it is worth kind of also just keeping in mind that,

02:31:41.840 --> 02:31:51.120
like, it is greatly empowering for so many people. I'm a huge, huge believer in the upside, at least

02:31:51.120 --> 02:31:56.800
up to a point, right, where we may not be able to control the overall situation anymore. But as long

02:31:56.800 --> 02:32:01.440
as, you know, we're in this kind of sweet spot, you know, and hopefully it doesn't prove too fleeting,

02:32:02.160 --> 02:32:08.480
then I call myself an adoption accelerationist and a hyperscaling pauser. You know, I would like to

02:32:08.480 --> 02:32:16.320
see everybody be able to take advantage of the incredible benefits of the technology while also

02:32:16.320 --> 02:32:20.720
being like, you know, obviously cautious about where we go from here because I don't think we have a

02:32:20.720 --> 02:32:27.200
great handle on what happens next. But I think that is kind of the core open AI argument, you know,

02:32:27.200 --> 02:32:31.360
I think that's the story they're telling themselves first and foremost. And then this, like, wake-up

02:32:31.360 --> 02:32:37.200
story, I think is kind of something they also do sincerely believe, but it's not like the, I don't

02:32:37.200 --> 02:32:44.000
think that's the primary driver of kind of how they see the value, but I do think it is pretty

02:32:44.800 --> 02:32:50.240
compelling. You know, I think if somebody like Ethan Molek, for example, who has become a real

02:32:50.320 --> 02:32:57.600
leader in terms of, I kind of think of him as like a kindred AI scout, you know, who just goes out

02:32:57.600 --> 02:33:01.360
and tries to characterize these things, what can they do? What can't they do? What are their strengths

02:33:01.360 --> 02:33:06.160
and weaknesses? You know, in what areas can they help with productivity and how much? And, you know,

02:33:07.120 --> 02:33:13.760
all these questions, there's just so many questions that we really don't have good answers to. And we

02:33:13.760 --> 02:33:19.680
really couldn't get good answers to until we had something kind of at least human-ish level.

02:33:20.880 --> 02:33:25.920
GPT-3 just wasn't that good. You know, it wasn't like, it wasn't that interesting. It wasn't compelling

02:33:25.920 --> 02:33:30.880
to these sort of leading thinkers to say, I'm going to reorient my career and my research agenda

02:33:30.880 --> 02:33:36.000
around GPT-3. They might have even felt like, yeah, I see where this is going, but it's just

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:41.600
as an object of study unto itself, it just wasn't quite there. So I think you had to have something

02:33:41.600 --> 02:33:48.320
like a GPT-4 to inspire people outside of machine learning to really take an interest and try to

02:33:48.320 --> 02:33:52.480
figure out what's going on here. And now we do have that, right? I mean, certainly could hope for

02:33:52.480 --> 02:33:58.400
more. And the preparedness team from OpenAI will hopefully bring us more, but we've got economists

02:33:58.400 --> 02:34:03.280
now. You know, we've got people from all these, you know, from medicine, from law, we've got all

02:34:03.280 --> 02:34:09.600
these different disciplines now saying, okay, I'm going to study this. And I do think that's very,

02:34:09.600 --> 02:34:15.280
very important as well as the whole, you know, governance and regulation picture too.

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:21.200
Yeah, I may be sure to say, I'm sure if you're a typical staff member at OpenAI,

02:34:21.200 --> 02:34:24.880
the main thing you want to do is create a useful product that people love, which they have absolutely

02:34:24.880 --> 02:34:32.480
smashed out of the park on that point. I mean, I use GPT-4 and other, I actually use Claude as well

02:34:32.480 --> 02:34:36.720
for the larger context window sometimes with documents, but yeah, I mean, I use it throughout

02:34:36.720 --> 02:34:40.160
the day because I'm just someone who thinks up, I like think up questions all the time. And I used

02:34:40.160 --> 02:34:45.280
to Google, Google questions, you know, and it's just not very good at answering them a lot of

02:34:45.280 --> 02:34:50.400
the time. You can end up with some core question answering session that's kind of on a related

02:34:50.400 --> 02:34:54.800
topic, but it's a lot of mental work to get the answer that you want. And it's just so much better

02:34:55.440 --> 02:34:59.920
at answering many of the questions that one just has throughout the day when you're trying to learn.

02:34:59.920 --> 02:35:05.760
And I think, you know, you've got kids, I'm hopefully going to have a family pretty soon.

02:35:05.760 --> 02:35:10.960
If I imagine what a, you know, when my kid is six or seven, how should they be learning about the

02:35:10.960 --> 02:35:15.360
world? I think talking to these models is going to be so much better. Like they're going to be able

02:35:15.360 --> 02:35:21.840
to get time with a patient, really informed adult all the time, one-on-one explaining things to them.

02:35:21.840 --> 02:35:27.120
That doesn't feel like it's very far away at all. I mean, maybe they probably won't want to be typing,

02:35:27.120 --> 02:35:31.280
but you'll just be able to talk into it, right? You'll have a kind of teacher talking at you back,

02:35:31.280 --> 02:35:35.360
I think, with a visualization that is appealing to kids. Kids are going to be able to learn so

02:35:35.440 --> 02:35:41.200
fast from this is my guess, at least the ones who are engaged and are keen to, you know,

02:35:42.080 --> 02:35:45.680
they're enthusiastic about learning about the world, which I think so many of them are.

02:35:46.240 --> 02:35:49.440
So that's going to be incredible. Going to the doctor is a massive pain in the butt.

02:35:49.440 --> 02:35:53.360
I think you said in the extract that even when you were doing the red team, you're like,

02:35:53.360 --> 02:35:58.880
I prefer this to going to the doctor now, especially when you consider the enormous overhead.

02:35:58.880 --> 02:36:04.880
Yeah, so the applications are vast. But I was thinking, if you were someone who was primarily

02:36:04.880 --> 02:36:09.280
just focused about an existential risk, or that was kind of your remit within an open AI,

02:36:09.280 --> 02:36:13.040
then you might think, well, I should make a case for holding back on this. And then this

02:36:13.040 --> 02:36:15.440
would have been one of the things that would make you say, you know, actually, I don't know,

02:36:15.440 --> 02:36:19.120
it's really unclear whether it's a positive or negative to release this. So maybe it's fine to

02:36:19.120 --> 02:36:24.720
just go with the release by default approach, which I guess does seem reasonable if you don't

02:36:24.720 --> 02:36:29.440
really have a strong argument for holding back. Changing topics slightly. I've been trying to

02:36:29.440 --> 02:36:33.280
organize this interview with the goal of it not being totally obsolete by the time it comes out.

02:36:33.280 --> 02:36:37.840
And our editing process takes a little bit. And that makes it a little bit challenging

02:36:37.840 --> 02:36:44.080
when you're talking about current events like the board and Sam Altman, and I guess,

02:36:44.800 --> 02:36:48.800
they're fast back and forth between them. But there's one big question, which has really baffled

02:36:48.800 --> 02:36:53.920
me over the last week, which I think may still stand in a couple of weeks when this episode comes

02:36:53.920 --> 02:36:57.360
out. I think there's a decent chance, given that it hasn't been answered so far, which is,

02:36:57.360 --> 02:37:02.960
why hasn't the board of Open AI explained its motivations and actions from pretty early on?

02:37:02.960 --> 02:37:10.320
I think maybe 12 hours, 24 hours after the decision to remove Sam was initially announced,

02:37:10.320 --> 02:37:13.680
everyone began assuming that it was worries about AI safety. There must have been a big

02:37:13.680 --> 02:37:18.480
driving factor for them. And I think it's possible that that was a bit of a misfire,

02:37:18.480 --> 02:37:21.520
or at least I thought it might be, because people might have jumped to that conclusion,

02:37:21.520 --> 02:37:26.800
because that's what we were all talking about on Twitter. Or that was the big conversation

02:37:26.800 --> 02:37:34.560
in government and in newspapers around the time. But if that was the issue, why wouldn't the board

02:37:34.560 --> 02:37:39.120
say that? There's plenty of people who are receptive to these concerns in general,

02:37:39.120 --> 02:37:44.720
including within Open AI, I imagine people who have at least some worries that maybe Open AI is

02:37:44.720 --> 02:37:49.680
going a little bit too fast, at least in certain launches or certain training runs that they're

02:37:49.680 --> 02:37:53.520
doing. But they said it wasn't about that, basically, or they denied that it was anything

02:37:53.520 --> 02:37:57.920
about safety specifically. And I'm a little bit inclined to believe them, because if it was

02:37:57.920 --> 02:38:02.080
about that, I feel like why wouldn't they just say something? But I guess it's also just the

02:38:02.080 --> 02:38:05.680
fact that we've been talking about earlier that Open AI doesn't seem like it's that out of line

02:38:05.680 --> 02:38:09.200
with what other companies are doing. It doesn't seem like it stands out as a particularly unsafe

02:38:09.200 --> 02:38:14.960
actor within the space relative to the competition. But I think that the same kind of goes with almost

02:38:14.960 --> 02:38:19.360
all of the reasons that you could offer for why the board decided to make this snap decision.

02:38:19.360 --> 02:38:23.840
You know, why wouldn't they at least defend the actions so that people who were inclined to

02:38:23.840 --> 02:38:29.600
agree with them could come along for the ride and speak up in favor of what they were doing.

02:38:29.600 --> 02:38:36.160
So I'm just left, I have been baffled basically from the start of this entire saga as to what is

02:38:36.160 --> 02:38:41.680
really going on, which is kind of, I mean, I've just tried to remain agnostic and open-minded,

02:38:41.680 --> 02:38:45.360
that there might be important facts that I don't understand, important things going on, that,

02:38:46.080 --> 02:38:48.800
you know, important information that might come out later on that would cause me to change in

02:38:48.800 --> 02:38:52.800
my mind. And in anticipation of that, I should be a little bit agnostic. But yeah, do you have any

02:38:52.800 --> 02:38:58.320
theory about this kind of central mystery of this entire instigating event?

02:38:59.520 --> 02:39:10.240
I mean, it is a very baffling decision ultimately to not say anything. I don't have an account.

02:39:10.240 --> 02:39:15.920
I think I can better try to interpret what they were probably thinking and, you know,

02:39:15.920 --> 02:39:22.240
and some of their reasons that I can, the reason for not explaining themselves. That to me is just

02:39:22.240 --> 02:39:31.600
very hard to wrap one's head around. It's almost as if they were so in the dynamics of, you know,

02:39:31.600 --> 02:39:37.520
their structure and who had what power locally within, you know, the over, you know, obviously

02:39:37.520 --> 02:39:42.720
the nonprofit controls the for-profit and all that sort of stuff, that they kind of failed to

02:39:42.720 --> 02:39:49.360
realize that like the whole world was watching this now, and that these kind of local power

02:39:49.360 --> 02:39:57.120
structures, you know, are still kind of subject to some like global check, you know, like they sort

02:39:57.120 --> 02:40:02.880
of maybe interpreted themselves as like the final authority, which on paper was true, but wasn't

02:40:02.880 --> 02:40:10.240
really true when the whole world, you know, has started to pay attention to this, not just this

02:40:10.240 --> 02:40:15.920
phenomenon of AI, but this particular company and this particular guy, right, is like particularly

02:40:15.920 --> 02:40:22.480
well-known. So now they've had plenty of time, though, to correct that, right? So that kind of

02:40:22.480 --> 02:40:27.040
only goes for like 24 hours, right? I mean, you would think even if they sort of had made that

02:40:27.040 --> 02:40:33.920
mistake up front and were just kind of so locally focused that they didn't realize that the whole

02:40:33.920 --> 02:40:38.160
world was going to be up in arms and, you know, might ultimately kind of force their hand on a

02:40:38.160 --> 02:40:44.000
reversal. I don't know why, I mean, that was made very clear, I would think, within 24 hours,

02:40:44.560 --> 02:40:48.960
unless they were still just so focused and kind of in the weeds on the negotiations or, you know,

02:40:48.960 --> 02:40:55.200
that I mean, I'm sure the internal politics were intense. So, you know, no shortage of things for

02:40:55.200 --> 02:41:00.560
them to be thinking about at the object level locally, but I would have had to, I would have

02:41:00.560 --> 02:41:06.320
to imagine that the noise from outside also must have cracked through to some extent, you know,

02:41:06.320 --> 02:41:10.400
they must have checked Twitter at some point during this process and then like, hey, this is

02:41:10.400 --> 02:41:17.520
not going down well, right? Yeah, I mean, it was not an obscure story, right? And this even made

02:41:17.520 --> 02:41:23.840
the Bill Simmons sports podcast in the United States. And he does not touch almost anything

02:41:23.840 --> 02:41:27.920
but sports. This is one of the biggest sports podcasts, if not maybe the biggest in the United

02:41:27.920 --> 02:41:37.200
States. And he even covered this story. So, you know, it went very far. And why, you know,

02:41:37.200 --> 02:41:44.560
still to this day, and we're what, how many 10 days or so later, still nothing that is very

02:41:45.520 --> 02:41:50.240
surprising. And I really don't have a good explanation for it. I think maybe the best

02:41:50.240 --> 02:41:56.000
theory that I've heard, maybe, maybe two, I don't know, maybe even give three kind of leading

02:41:56.000 --> 02:42:00.720
contender theories. One very briefly is just lawyers. You know, that's kind of, I saw Eliezer

02:42:00.720 --> 02:42:07.680
advance that that, hey, don't ask lawyers what you can and can't do, instead ask, what's the

02:42:07.680 --> 02:42:11.760
worst thing that happens if I do this and how do I mitigate it? Because if you're worried that you

02:42:11.760 --> 02:42:18.800
might get sued or you're worried that, you know, whatever, try to get your hands around the consequences,

02:42:18.800 --> 02:42:23.040
you know, and figure out how to deal with them or if you want to deal with them, versus just

02:42:23.040 --> 02:42:28.080
asking the lawyers like, can I, or can't I, because they'll probably often say no. And that

02:42:28.080 --> 02:42:32.720
doesn't mean that no is the right answer. So that's one possible explanation. Another one, which I

02:42:32.720 --> 02:42:41.120
would attribute to Zvi, who is a great analyst on this, was that basically the thinking is kind

02:42:41.120 --> 02:42:49.200
of holistic. And that, you know, what Emmett Shearer had said was that this wasn't a specific

02:42:49.280 --> 02:42:55.520
disagreement about safety. As I recall the quote, he didn't say that it was not about safety

02:42:56.320 --> 02:43:02.800
writ large, but that it was not a specific disagreement about safety. So a way you might

02:43:02.800 --> 02:43:08.880
interpret that would be that they sort of, you know, maybe for reasons like what I outlined in

02:43:08.880 --> 02:43:15.280
my, you know, narrative storytelling of the red team, where I, you know, people have heard this,

02:43:15.280 --> 02:43:20.800
but finally get to the board member and this board member has not tried GPT-4 after I've been

02:43:20.800 --> 02:43:27.680
testing it for two months. And I'm like, wait a second, what, you know, were you not interested?

02:43:27.680 --> 02:43:34.320
Did they not tell you? What is going on here? Right? I think there's something, a sort of set

02:43:34.320 --> 02:43:39.120
of different things like that, perhaps, where, hey, they maybe felt like maybe in some situations,

02:43:39.120 --> 02:43:43.120
he sort of on the margin kind of underplayed things or let them think something a little bit

02:43:43.120 --> 02:43:47.360
different than what was really true, probably without, you know, really lying or having a,

02:43:48.800 --> 02:43:52.640
you know, an obvious like smoking gun. But that would also be consistent with what

02:43:53.200 --> 02:43:58.560
the COO had said that this was a breakdown in communication between Sam and the board,

02:43:59.280 --> 02:44:04.320
not like a direct, you know, single thing that you could say this was super wrong,

02:44:04.320 --> 02:44:07.680
but rather like, hey, we kind of lost some confidence here, we kind of lost some confidence here.

02:44:08.640 --> 02:44:14.080
All things equal, you know, do we really think this is the guy that we want to trust for this

02:44:14.080 --> 02:44:19.200
like super high stakes thing? And, you know, I tried to take pains in my writing and commentary on

02:44:19.200 --> 02:44:24.880
this to say, you know, it's not harsh judgment on any individual and Sam Altman has kind of said

02:44:24.880 --> 02:44:30.800
this himself. His quote was, we shouldn't trust any individual person here. And, you know, that was

02:44:30.800 --> 02:44:35.280
on the back of saying the board can fire me and I think that's important. We shouldn't trust any

02:44:35.440 --> 02:44:41.120
individual person here. I think that is true. I think that is, you know, is apt. And I think the

02:44:41.120 --> 02:44:45.200
board may have kind of been feeling like, Hey, we've got a couple of reasons that we've lost

02:44:45.200 --> 02:44:52.560
some confidence. And we don't really want to trust any one person. And you are like this

02:44:52.560 --> 02:44:56.480
super charismatic leader that, that, you know, I don't know what degree they sort of realized

02:44:56.480 --> 02:45:00.880
what loyalty he had from the team at that time, probably they underestimated that if anything.

02:45:01.840 --> 02:45:06.480
But, you know, charismatic, insane deal maker, super, you know, kind of

02:45:07.360 --> 02:45:13.440
entrepreneur, the Uber entrepreneur, is that the kind of person that we want to trust with the

02:45:14.160 --> 02:45:18.960
super important decisions that we see on the horizon? You know, this is the kind of thing

02:45:18.960 --> 02:45:24.720
that you maybe just have a hard time communicating. It's like, but still, I think they should try,

02:45:24.720 --> 02:45:29.520
you know, these kind of bottom line was like, if anything that you say seems weak,

02:45:29.520 --> 02:45:33.280
but you still believe it, then maybe you say nothing. But I would still say like, you know,

02:45:33.280 --> 02:45:38.640
try to make the case. It certainly doesn't seem like saying nothing has worked better than

02:45:38.640 --> 02:45:44.400
trying to make some case. And you might also imagine that, and this has been common among

02:45:44.400 --> 02:45:49.520
the AI safety set, you might imagine too that if there was something around

02:45:50.160 --> 02:45:55.520
capabilities advances or whatever, they didn't want to draw even more attention to

02:45:56.240 --> 02:46:00.000
a new breakthrough or what have you. But if, you know, if that were the case, I think we've had

02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:04.080
kind of a stri-sand effect on that, because now everybody's like scrambling to, you know,

02:46:04.080 --> 02:46:10.080
and speculating wildly about what is Q-Star. And it's the only thing people seem to be talking

02:46:10.080 --> 02:46:15.600
about lately. Yeah. Yeah. So I don't think it's, you know, technically, I would say clearly,

02:46:15.600 --> 02:46:21.200
it's not worked well. My theory as to what is going on is kind of in that middle case where

02:46:21.280 --> 02:46:28.880
I think basically several of the board members, two, three, had maybe been of this opinion for a

02:46:28.880 --> 02:46:34.480
while, right? That if we could change leadership here, we would. And not necessarily because

02:46:34.480 --> 02:46:39.040
Sam has done anything super flagrant, but maybe because, you know, we've seen a couple of things

02:46:39.040 --> 02:46:43.680
where we like didn't feel like he was being consistently candid. And we just kind of just

02:46:43.680 --> 02:46:48.880
don't think he's the guy that we want to trust. And that's our, you know, that's our sacred mission

02:46:48.880 --> 02:46:53.760
here is to figure out who to trust. And if he's not the guy, then, you know, that's kind of all

02:46:53.760 --> 02:46:59.280
we need to know. They probably had had that opinion for a while. I doubt it was like super

02:46:59.280 --> 02:47:04.320
spontaneous for most of them. And then what seems to have kind of tipped things was all of a sudden

02:47:04.320 --> 02:47:10.480
Ilya, chief scientist, came to that conclusion, at least temporarily. And that would also be

02:47:10.480 --> 02:47:15.280
consistent with why there was such a rushed statement. If you are in a, you know, if you have a

02:47:15.280 --> 02:47:22.400
three versus three board, and all of a sudden one flips and makes it four or two, you might be

02:47:22.400 --> 02:47:27.840
inclined to say, let's do, let's go now. Because if we wait, you know, maybe he'll flip back, which,

02:47:27.840 --> 02:47:34.160
you know, obviously he did. And, you know, so you just maybe kind of try to seize that moment.

02:47:34.160 --> 02:47:37.760
Again, none of this really explains, this is a theory of what happened. It's not really a theory

02:47:37.760 --> 02:47:42.800
of what prevents them from telling us what happened, though. Yeah. Yeah. And I guess that

02:47:42.800 --> 02:47:47.840
that raises then the top question will be what made Ilya switch? You know, he's worked with

02:47:47.840 --> 02:47:52.880
Sam Altman for a long time. I guess he's had, you know, his opinions, his enthusiasm for

02:47:53.760 --> 02:47:58.400
studying and research, studying and progressing towards AGI as well as worries about how it could

02:47:58.400 --> 02:48:03.920
go poorly. I think that's a very long standing position from him. So it'd be very interesting

02:48:03.920 --> 02:48:09.120
if that is the story. I'd love to know what caused him to change his mind. And I mean,

02:48:09.120 --> 02:48:13.520
you can imagine, even if the if the other three who were less involved, who don't work at Open AI

02:48:13.520 --> 02:48:18.160
are more outsiders. If the other three were on the fence about it, maybe not sure that it's the

02:48:18.160 --> 02:48:22.960
right idea. And then the chief scientist comes to you, the person who knows the most about it

02:48:22.960 --> 02:48:28.080
technologically is also has a big focus on safety and always has and says, we got to go.

02:48:29.280 --> 02:48:32.560
Then I feel like that would be quite persuasive, even if you weren't entirely convinced and could

02:48:32.560 --> 02:48:37.680
explain the haste of the decision. But I mean, it's yeah, very super, super speculative.

02:48:37.680 --> 02:48:43.760
Yeah, it does seem at least somewhat credibly reported at this point that there was some

02:48:44.720 --> 02:48:49.840
recent breakthrough. I think that the notion that there was a letter sent from a couple of

02:48:50.480 --> 02:48:55.760
team members to the board, you know, seems to likely be true. There's also this,

02:48:55.760 --> 02:48:58.800
the Sam Altman comments in public recently, where he said, you know, we've

02:48:59.920 --> 02:49:03.280
four times at the company or whatever, we've pushed back the veil of ignorance one just in

02:49:03.280 --> 02:49:08.400
the last couple of weeks. So there does seem to be enough circumstantial evidence that there is some

02:49:09.600 --> 02:49:16.080
significant advance that was probably somewhat of a precipitating event for

02:49:17.040 --> 02:49:21.120
Ilya. I mean, that seems to be the most likely explanation. I'm definitely in the realm of

02:49:21.120 --> 02:49:24.560
speculation here, where I don't like to spend too much time, but you know,

02:49:25.280 --> 02:49:26.800
current situation sort of demands it.

02:49:28.080 --> 02:49:30.640
I mean, that actually raises a whole other angle that I've heard people talk about almost

02:49:30.640 --> 02:49:34.800
not at all. And yeah, we should get off the speculation, but given that there was obviously

02:49:34.800 --> 02:49:38.880
these tensions with the board, it's quite surprising that Sam Altman was seeing these

02:49:38.880 --> 02:49:44.080
things publicly, things that probably could have been anticipated might be, might aggravate the board

02:49:44.080 --> 02:49:50.320
and cause them, cause their like trust issues to become, to become more serious. So seems

02:49:51.200 --> 02:49:56.800
quite a few surprising actions that people have taken on all sides that make it a little bit

02:49:56.800 --> 02:50:02.560
mysterious. Yeah. I mean, he's an interesting guy for sure. And I do, to give credit where it's

02:50:02.560 --> 02:50:10.080
due, I think he's done a lot right. He has been, I think very forthright about the highest level

02:50:10.080 --> 02:50:16.880
risks. I think he's been very apt when it comes to the sorts of regulations that he has endorsed,

02:50:16.880 --> 02:50:21.840
and also the sort that he's warned against. I think they did a pretty good job at least

02:50:21.920 --> 02:50:28.240
trying to set up some sort of governance structure that would put a check on him.

02:50:29.520 --> 02:50:35.680
I don't think that was all like a, that'd be quite a long con if that was all some sort of

02:50:35.680 --> 02:50:40.800
master plan. I don't think that was really the case. So I've never thought for a minute really

02:50:40.800 --> 02:50:45.760
that Sam Altman is pretending to think that superintelligence could be risky. And I mean,

02:50:45.760 --> 02:50:50.480
one reason among others is he was writing on his blog about how superintelligence could be

02:50:50.560 --> 02:50:55.680
incredibly dangerous and might cause human extinction back in 2016. So this was a fundraising

02:50:55.680 --> 02:51:00.880
strategy for open AI. That is a very long game. And I am extremely impressed by the 4D chess

02:51:00.880 --> 02:51:04.560
that he's been playing there. I think the simplest explanation is just he sees

02:51:05.280 --> 02:51:10.720
straightforwardly as I think many of us think that we do see that it's very powerful. And

02:51:10.720 --> 02:51:14.640
when you have something that's incredibly powerful, it can go in many different directions.

02:51:14.640 --> 02:51:17.360
Yeah. Well, there is precedent for this too, right? This is another,

02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:25.360
just, it's like such an obvious fact, but humans were not always present on planet Earth. And we

02:51:25.360 --> 02:51:30.080
kind of popped up. We had some particular capabilities that other things didn't have.

02:51:30.800 --> 02:51:38.560
And our reign as kind of the dominant species on the planet has not been good for a lot of other

02:51:38.560 --> 02:51:44.080
of our, you know, planetary cohabitants. That includes like our closest cousins, you know,

02:51:44.080 --> 02:51:49.360
which we've driven to extinction early in our own history. It includes basically, you know,

02:51:49.360 --> 02:51:56.720
all the megafauna outside of Africa and, you know, just all sorts of natural ecosystems as well,

02:51:56.720 --> 02:52:04.160
right? We have not, we have not taken care to preserve everything around us in the early parts

02:52:04.160 --> 02:52:08.560
of our existence. We didn't even think about that or know to think about it, right? We were just

02:52:08.560 --> 02:52:12.880
kind of doing what we were doing and trying to get by and trying to survive. Now we're, you know,

02:52:12.880 --> 02:52:19.760
far enough along that we are at least conscious or at least try to be conscious of taking care of

02:52:19.760 --> 02:52:22.960
the things around us, but we're still not doing a great job.

02:52:22.960 --> 02:52:24.080
And even results.

02:52:24.080 --> 02:52:29.440
Yeah, definitely. And a lot of the damage has already been done, right? We're not going to

02:52:29.440 --> 02:52:35.040
bring back the mammoths or, you know, or the Neanderthals or a lot of other things either.

02:52:35.040 --> 02:52:40.960
So I think there is, I always just kind of go back to that precedent because it's so like,

02:52:40.960 --> 02:52:45.600
to me, it's like kind of chilling to think that like, we are the thing that is currently causing

02:52:45.600 --> 02:52:50.160
the mass extinction, right? So why do we think that the, you know, the next thing that we're

02:52:50.160 --> 02:52:56.800
going to create is like necessarily going to be good. There's no reason in history to think that.

02:52:56.800 --> 02:53:01.120
There's also no reason in the experience of using the models to think that, you know,

02:53:01.120 --> 02:53:05.840
there's a lot of different versions of them, but it is very clear that alignment does not

02:53:05.840 --> 02:53:12.880
happen by default. It may be not super hard. It may be impossibly hard, but it's definitely not

02:53:12.880 --> 02:53:19.440
like just coming for free. Like that's very obvious at this point. So with all that context,

02:53:19.440 --> 02:53:23.920
you know, just briefly returning to the same topic, he is kind of a loose cannon. You know,

02:53:23.920 --> 02:53:30.640
I mean, he posting on Reddit that AGI has been achieved internally is on one level.

02:53:31.280 --> 02:53:33.440
I honestly do think like legitimately funny.

02:53:33.520 --> 02:53:40.320
I know. On one level, I really do love it. I mean, I feel like even in my very modest position

02:53:40.320 --> 02:53:46.480
of responsibility as a podcast host, I'm too chicken to do things like that. But on some

02:53:46.480 --> 02:53:50.240
level, you have to kind of wish that you were the person who had the shoots, but to make comments

02:53:50.240 --> 02:53:55.200
like that. And I do admire it on one level. Yeah. But if you're the board, you could also

02:53:55.200 --> 02:54:00.560
think, geez, you know, is that really consistent with the sort of... The vibes seem off.

02:54:01.520 --> 02:54:07.600
Yeah. It's just easy. It's easy to imagine them feeling that the best person we could find

02:54:08.240 --> 02:54:12.960
probably wouldn't do that. You know, so I don't think that's like a super crazy

02:54:13.680 --> 02:54:17.600
position for them to take, even though again, I don't... And maybe it's not the best person,

02:54:17.600 --> 02:54:24.000
but maybe it's the best structure that we could create. I don't, you know, it's not a harsh knock

02:54:24.000 --> 02:54:29.520
on Sam at all. I think if we had to pick one person, he'd be, you know, pretty high up there

02:54:29.600 --> 02:54:35.680
on my list of people, but that doesn't mean he's at the very top. And, you know, it also doesn't

02:54:35.680 --> 02:54:42.400
mean that it should be any one person as he himself has said. I think, you know, you mentioned

02:54:42.400 --> 02:54:47.280
too like what... So what caused Illya to get freaked out in the first place? And then there's also

02:54:47.280 --> 02:54:51.760
the question of like what caused him to flip back. The accounts of that are like, you know,

02:54:51.760 --> 02:54:55.840
an emotional conversation with other people, which certainly could be compelling. I also

02:54:55.840 --> 02:55:00.560
wouldn't discount the idea that he might have just seen, well, shit, if everybody's just going

02:55:00.560 --> 02:55:07.120
to go to Microsoft, you know, then we're really no better off. And maybe this was all just a big

02:55:07.120 --> 02:55:15.040
mistake, even tactically, you know, let alone, you know, at the cost of my equity and my relationships

02:55:15.040 --> 02:55:21.120
or whatever else, but even just from a purely AI safety standpoint, if all I've accomplished is

02:55:21.920 --> 02:55:27.920
kind of shuttling everyone over across the street to a Microsoft situation, you know, that doesn't

02:55:27.920 --> 02:55:32.880
seem really any better. He probably loses influence. I mean, he's probably, there's some influence in

02:55:32.880 --> 02:55:40.480
any event, but probably loses even more if they go all to Microsoft. So the things that he maybe

02:55:40.480 --> 02:55:45.600
most cared about, it probably became pretty quickly clear that they weren't really advanced

02:55:46.160 --> 02:55:52.160
by this move. And so, you know, take him at his word that he deeply regretted the

02:55:53.120 --> 02:55:59.760
action. And so here we are. Yeah, yeah. I guess, long time listeners of the show would know that

02:55:59.760 --> 02:56:05.280
I interviewed Helen Toner back in, who's on the open AI board back in 2019. And I guess, you know,

02:56:05.280 --> 02:56:09.920
I've interviewed a number of other people for open AI, as well as the other labs as well.

02:56:09.920 --> 02:56:15.920
And Tasha McCauley, who's on the open AI board, also happens to be on the board for our fiscal

02:56:15.920 --> 02:56:21.120
sponsor, Effective Ventures Foundation. Less people think that this is giving me the inside

02:56:21.120 --> 02:56:26.320
track on what is going on with the board. It is not. I do not have any particular insight,

02:56:26.320 --> 02:56:31.520
and I don't think nobody else here does either, unfortunately.

02:56:31.520 --> 02:56:36.320
Yeah, it's kind of amazing how little has come out, really, you know, in a world where it's

02:56:36.320 --> 02:56:40.240
like very difficult to keep secrets. That's true. This has been a remarkably well kept secret.

02:56:41.120 --> 02:56:45.520
Yeah, it's extraordinary. I mean, I look forward to finding out what it is at some point.

02:56:46.640 --> 02:56:50.880
It feels like there must be more to the story. Or whoever gets the scoop on this, whoever shares

02:56:50.880 --> 02:56:56.400
it, is going to have a very big audience. I'm confident of that. A really interesting reaction

02:56:56.400 --> 02:57:02.560
I saw to the whole Sam Olman opening AI board situation was this opinion piece from Ezra Klein,

02:57:02.560 --> 02:57:06.160
who's been on the show a couple of times, and it's just one of my one of my favorite

02:57:06.160 --> 02:57:11.440
podcasters by far. I'm a big fan of the Ezra Klein shows that people should subscribe if they

02:57:11.440 --> 02:57:15.840
haven't already. I'll just read a little quote from here and maybe get a reaction from you.

02:57:15.840 --> 02:57:20.640
The title was The Unsubling Lesson of the Open AI Mess, and Ezra, I don't know whether

02:57:20.640 --> 02:57:24.320
the board was right to fire Altman. It certainly has not made a public case that would justify

02:57:24.320 --> 02:57:28.720
the decision, but the non-profit board was at the center of open AI structure for a reason.

02:57:28.720 --> 02:57:32.400
It was supposed to be able to push the off button, but there is no off button.

02:57:32.400 --> 02:57:36.640
The for-profit proved it can just reconstitute itself elsewhere. And don't forget, there's still

02:57:36.640 --> 02:57:41.200
Google's AI division and Meta's AI division and Anthropic and Inflection and many others who've

02:57:41.200 --> 02:57:45.520
all built large language models similar to GPT-4 and are yoking them to business models similar

02:57:45.520 --> 02:57:50.320
to Open AI's. Capitalism is itself a kind of artificial intelligence, and it's far further

02:57:50.320 --> 02:57:54.800
along than anything the computer scientists have yet coded up. And in that sense, it copied Open AI's

02:57:54.800 --> 02:57:59.280
code long ago. Ensuring that AI serves humanity was always a job too important to be left to

02:57:59.280 --> 02:58:03.840
corporations, no matter their internal structures. That's the job of governments, at least in theory.

02:58:03.840 --> 02:58:08.480
And so the second major AI event of the last few weeks was less riveting, but that's more consequential.

02:58:08.480 --> 02:58:12.400
On October 30th, the Biden administration released a major executive order on the

02:58:12.400 --> 02:58:17.120
safe, secure, and trustworthy development and use of AI. So basically, Ezra's conclusion,

02:58:18.000 --> 02:58:24.080
which I guess is kind of my conclusion as well from this whole episode, it's made it more obvious

02:58:24.080 --> 02:58:31.520
that it's not possible really inside the labs to stop the march, that as long as many of the

02:58:31.520 --> 02:58:37.520
staff want to continue, as long as the government isn't preventing it, people, you know, any governing

02:58:37.520 --> 02:58:43.760
institution within the labs doesn't actually have the power to make a meaningful delay to what's

02:58:43.760 --> 02:58:48.000
going on. Staff can move the knowledge of how to make these things is pretty broadly distributed,

02:58:48.000 --> 02:58:53.760
and the economic imperatives are just so great. You know, the sheer amount of profit potential

02:58:53.760 --> 02:59:00.560
that's there is so vast that forces are brought to bear from investors and other actors who stand

02:59:00.560 --> 02:59:06.160
to make money if things go well, to make sure that anyone who tries to slow things down is

02:59:07.360 --> 02:59:15.120
squashed, does not get their way. Yeah, do you agree with that? Is that something that I think

02:59:15.120 --> 02:59:19.920
the public might realize from this episode? You know, looking at things from substantially further

02:59:19.920 --> 02:59:26.080
away? Yeah, I think the one addition maybe I would make to that is I think the team

02:59:27.200 --> 02:59:36.160
as a whole now holds a lot of power. I think the dynamic that quickly emerged after the board's

02:59:36.160 --> 02:59:44.880
decision really hinged on the fact that the team was all signing up to go with Sam and Greg,

02:59:44.880 --> 02:59:49.120
wherever they were going to go. And at that point, it became pretty clear that the board

02:59:49.120 --> 02:59:52.960
had to do some sort of backtrack. I mean, they could have just let them go, I suppose. But if

02:59:52.960 --> 02:59:59.040
they wanted to salvage the situation to the best of their ability, they were like, okay, yeah,

02:59:59.040 --> 03:00:05.360
we'll go ahead and can we agree on a successor board? Let's keep this thing together. And the

03:00:05.360 --> 03:00:09.840
staff also did have reason to do that because they do have financial interest in the company. And

03:00:09.840 --> 03:00:13.840
who knows how that would have translated to Microsoft, but I don't think they would have got

03:00:13.920 --> 03:00:22.720
full value on their recent whatever $90 billion valuation or whatever. There was and presumably

03:00:22.720 --> 03:00:28.960
still will be now once the dust settles a secondary share offering where individual

03:00:29.760 --> 03:00:35.040
team members were going to be able to sell shares to investors and achieve some early

03:00:35.040 --> 03:00:40.240
liquidity for themselves. So obviously, people like to do that when they can. I don't think that

03:00:40.240 --> 03:00:46.400
was part of the deal going to Microsoft. So they wanted to keep the current structure alive if

03:00:46.400 --> 03:00:51.200
they could, but they were willing to walk if the board was going to burn it all down, especially

03:00:51.200 --> 03:00:57.600
with no explanation. And one of the things I've tried to get across in my kind of communication to

03:00:57.600 --> 03:01:04.960
the OpenAI team is that you are now the last check. Nobody else, the board can't check you

03:01:04.960 --> 03:01:09.680
because you guys can just all walk and we've seen that. The government, yes, may come in

03:01:09.680 --> 03:01:14.960
and check everybody at some point. And hopefully they do a good job as we've discussed, but

03:01:15.600 --> 03:01:20.000
can't necessarily count on that either. But you guys are the ones that are most in the know.

03:01:20.720 --> 03:01:26.480
And if there is a significant and it wouldn't have to be everybody, but if there were ever a

03:01:26.480 --> 03:01:36.880
significant portion of, for example, the OpenAI team that wanted to blow a whistle or wanted to

03:01:36.880 --> 03:01:43.120
stop the development of something, I think that's maybe now where the real check is.

03:01:44.000 --> 03:01:51.120
Sam Altman can't force the team to work, right? Everybody has obviously other,

03:01:51.120 --> 03:01:55.200
they're highly employable, right? Literally, I think probably any employee from OpenAI

03:01:55.760 --> 03:02:02.080
could go raise millions to start their own startup on basically just the premise that they came from

03:02:02.080 --> 03:02:08.320
OpenAI. Probably almost don't even need a plan at this point. So they are highly employable.

03:02:08.320 --> 03:02:15.280
They have a lot of kind of individual flexibility and maneuverability. And as any significant

03:02:15.280 --> 03:02:23.120
subgroup, I do think they have some real power. So I've been trying to kind of plant that seed

03:02:23.120 --> 03:02:30.960
with these folks that you guys are at the frontier. You are creating the next GPT,

03:02:30.960 --> 03:02:36.000
general purpose technology. It's probably more powerful than any we've seen before.

03:02:37.120 --> 03:02:42.080
You're doing it largely in secret. Nobody even knows what it is you're developing.

03:02:43.120 --> 03:02:50.160
And all that adds up to you have the responsibility. You as the individual employees owe it to the

03:02:50.160 --> 03:02:58.000
rest of humanity, very literally, to continue to question the wisdom of what it is that you,

03:02:58.000 --> 03:03:06.800
as a group, are doing. And on the AGI versus AI point, it's the generality really. That's obviously

03:03:06.800 --> 03:03:12.640
that's the word, right? The G is the general. It's used, I mean, again, like all these things,

03:03:12.640 --> 03:03:17.680
it's not super well-defined. But I have been struck, especially with this notion that there's

03:03:17.680 --> 03:03:22.720
one more breakthrough that's kind of undisclosed and highly speculated about. I have been struck

03:03:22.720 --> 03:03:30.880
that we are hitting a point now where a specific roadmap to AGI can start to become credible.

03:03:32.160 --> 03:03:36.320
If you take GPT-4 and you add on to that, let's say that the speculation is right,

03:03:36.320 --> 03:03:43.280
that it's some structured search LLM hybrid, such that you have kind of the general fluid

03:03:43.280 --> 03:03:48.880
intelligence of LLMs, but now you also have the ability to go out and look down different

03:03:48.880 --> 03:03:52.720
branches of decision trees and figure out which ones look best and blah, blah, blah.

03:03:53.920 --> 03:03:59.600
If you have that, and it's really working, and you're starting to get close to AGI, and you're

03:03:59.600 --> 03:04:02.800
like, hey, maybe this is it, if we refine it, or maybe it's going to take one more breakthrough

03:04:02.800 --> 03:04:07.440
after this, then you might have a sense of what that next thing that you would need to solve is,

03:04:07.440 --> 03:04:10.960
or maybe it's even two more things, and you need to solve two more big things, but you

03:04:10.960 --> 03:04:15.440
kind of are starting to have a sense for what they are. Now we're getting into a world where AGI is

03:04:15.440 --> 03:04:24.080
not just some fuzzy umbrella catch-all term that right now it's defined by OpenAI as an AI that

03:04:24.080 --> 03:04:32.400
can do most economically valuable work better than most humans. That's just an outcome statement,

03:04:32.400 --> 03:04:37.680
but it doesn't describe the architecture, that doesn't describe how it works,

03:04:37.680 --> 03:04:42.400
that doesn't describe its relative strengths and weaknesses. All we know is it's really

03:04:42.400 --> 03:04:48.880
powerful, and you can kind of do everything. While there was no clear path to getting there,

03:04:48.880 --> 03:04:53.120
then maybe that was the best definition that we could come up with, but we are entering a period

03:04:53.120 --> 03:04:58.080
now where I would be surprised if it's more than two more breakthroughs, especially given that they

03:04:59.360 --> 03:05:05.680
reportedly have one new as yet undisclosed breakthrough. The fog is starting to lift,

03:05:06.560 --> 03:05:13.840
you don't necessarily have to be so abstract in your consideration of what AGI might be,

03:05:13.840 --> 03:05:20.240
but you're starting to get to the point where you can ask, what about this specific AGI that we

03:05:20.240 --> 03:05:29.280
appear to be on the path to creating? Is this specific form of AGI something that we want,

03:05:30.080 --> 03:05:36.080
or might we want to look for a different form? I think those questions are going to start to get

03:05:36.080 --> 03:05:41.200
a lot more tangible, but it is striking right now that the only people that are even in position to

03:05:41.840 --> 03:05:46.000
ask them with full information, let alone try to provide some sort of answer,

03:05:46.640 --> 03:05:53.360
are the teams at the companies. Really, probably just a couple of hundred people

03:05:53.360 --> 03:05:55.840
who have the most visibility on the cutting-edge stuff.

03:05:56.560 --> 03:06:01.120
This is one thing too that is really interesting about the anthropic approach. I don't know a lot

03:06:01.120 --> 03:06:10.560
about this, but my sense is that the knowledge sharing at OpenAI is pretty high. They're very

03:06:10.560 --> 03:06:15.440
tight about sharing stuff outside the company, but I think inside the company people probably

03:06:15.440 --> 03:06:20.640
have a pretty good idea of what's going on. Whatever that thing was, I think everybody there

03:06:20.640 --> 03:06:26.480
pretty much knows what it was. Anthropic, I have the sense that they have a highly collaborative

03:06:26.480 --> 03:06:31.200
culture. People speak very well about working there and all that, but they do have a policy of

03:06:31.200 --> 03:06:40.080
certain very sensitive things being need to know only. This kind of realization that we're getting

03:06:40.080 --> 03:06:46.960
to the point where the fog may be lifting and it's possible now to start to squint and see

03:06:47.360 --> 03:06:53.600
specific forms of AGI has me a little bit questioning that need to know

03:06:54.800 --> 03:07:01.520
policy within one of the leading companies. On the one hand, it's an anti-proliferation

03:07:01.520 --> 03:07:04.880
measure. I think that's how they've conceived of it. They don't want their stuff to leak.

03:07:08.720 --> 03:07:11.840
It's inevitable that they're going to have an agent of the Chinese government work for them at

03:07:11.920 --> 03:07:26.000
some point. They're trying to harden their own defenses so that even if they have a spy

03:07:26.000 --> 03:07:32.960
internally, that would still not be enough for certain things to end up making their way to

03:07:33.920 --> 03:07:40.880
the Chinese intelligence service or whatever. Obviously, that's a very worthwhile consideration

03:07:40.880 --> 03:07:46.000
both for just straightforward commercial reasons for them as well as broader security reasons.

03:07:47.200 --> 03:07:54.080
At the same time, you do have the problem that if only a few people know the most critical

03:07:54.640 --> 03:07:59.600
details of certain training techniques or whatever, then not very many people, even internally, at

03:07:59.600 --> 03:08:06.400
the company that's building it, maybe have enough of a picture to really do the questioning of what

03:08:06.400 --> 03:08:12.240
is it that we are exactly going to be building and is it what we want? I think that question is

03:08:12.240 --> 03:08:16.080
definitely one that we really do want to continue to ask. I don't know enough about what's been

03:08:16.080 --> 03:08:21.440
implemented at Anthropic to say this is definitely a problem or not, but it just spends a new thought

03:08:21.440 --> 03:08:30.320
that I've had recently that if the team is the check that is really going to matter, if we can't

03:08:30.320 --> 03:08:38.240
really rely on these protocols to hold up under intense global pressure, but the team can walk,

03:08:38.960 --> 03:08:44.480
then there could be some weirdness if you haven't even shared the information with most of the team

03:08:45.040 --> 03:08:54.160
internally. They've got a lot of considerations to try to balance there, and I hope they at

03:08:54.160 --> 03:08:59.040
least factor that one in. More broadly, I just hope that the teams at these leading companies

03:08:59.760 --> 03:09:07.120
continue to ask the question of, is this particular AGI that we seem to be approaching

03:09:07.120 --> 03:09:11.520
something that we actually want? Something that we feel sufficiently comfortable with,

03:09:12.080 --> 03:09:18.160
that we want to do it. I don't really like the trajectory that I see from OpenAI there to be

03:09:18.160 --> 03:09:23.280
totally candid. They recently updated their core values and it's the AGI focus and anything else is

03:09:23.280 --> 03:09:29.280
out of scope. You do feel like, man, are you just going to build the first one you can build?

03:09:29.920 --> 03:09:37.120
It seems like that is the mindset. We want to build AGI. Sam Altman has used phrases like

03:09:37.120 --> 03:09:43.680
the most direct path to AGI, but is the most direct path the best path? I'm not saying that

03:09:43.680 --> 03:09:48.560
they're not doing a lot of work to try to make it safe as they go on the most direct path, but

03:09:49.280 --> 03:09:52.880
these things probably have very different characters, very different kind of

03:09:53.600 --> 03:09:58.480
vibes, if you will, or aesthetics, or just things that are not even necessarily about

03:09:59.280 --> 03:10:04.080
can they get out of the server and take over the world, but what kind of world are they going to

03:10:04.080 --> 03:10:11.360
create even if they're properly functioning? That is, I guess, the role of the new preparedness team,

03:10:12.480 --> 03:10:16.160
but they've made it pretty far without even having a preparedness team, and so it does seem

03:10:16.400 --> 03:10:23.440
to me, it's on all of them at OpenAI and others, but certainly we're talking about OpenAI today.

03:10:24.240 --> 03:10:31.040
It's on all of them to meditate on that on an individual basis, increasingly regularly as we

03:10:31.040 --> 03:10:41.360
get increasingly close, and be willing to say no if it seems like the whole thing is being

03:10:41.360 --> 03:10:45.840
rushed into something that maybe isn't the best AGI we could imagine. Let's not just take the

03:10:45.840 --> 03:10:52.560
first AGI, you don't marry the first person you ever went on to date with, right? You want to find

03:10:52.560 --> 03:11:00.480
the right AGI for you, and so I just hope we remain a little choosy about our AGI's and don't just

03:11:00.480 --> 03:11:07.680
rush to marry the first AGI that comes along. I guess the natural pushback on this point from

03:11:07.680 --> 03:11:13.360
Ezra is that, well, this wasn't an off switch because the case wasn't made at all, that things

03:11:13.360 --> 03:11:17.840
should be switched off, and the staff at OpenAI were not brought into it, but if the case were

03:11:17.840 --> 03:11:23.200
made with some evidence, with supporting arguments that were compelling, then maybe the off switch

03:11:23.200 --> 03:11:29.440
would function or at least partially function, and I think you're exactly right that the 700

03:11:29.440 --> 03:11:35.120
staff at OpenAI have potentially collectively enormous, almost total influence over the strategy

03:11:35.120 --> 03:11:40.880
that OpenAI adopts if they were willing to speak up, but that mechanism, and in some ways that's

03:11:40.880 --> 03:11:46.400
actually, I'm sure we wish many different accountability mechanisms or decision making

03:11:46.400 --> 03:11:50.640
mechanisms, but of course that group knows more probably than any other group in the world

03:11:50.640 --> 03:11:54.960
about what the technology is capable of and its strengths and weaknesses, so you could have worse

03:11:54.960 --> 03:11:59.600
decision makers than that 700 group of people coming together in a forum and discussing it in

03:11:59.600 --> 03:12:06.160
great detail, but for that to function, it does require that those 700 ML scientists and engineers

03:12:06.960 --> 03:12:13.280
regard it as their responsibility as part of their job to have an opinion about whether what

03:12:13.280 --> 03:12:17.280
OpenAI is doing is the right, whether it's the right path and whether they would like to see

03:12:17.280 --> 03:12:22.240
adjustments. If many of them just say, well, I'm keeping my head down, I'm just doing my job,

03:12:22.240 --> 03:12:30.080
I just code this part of the model, I just work on this narrow question, then 95% of them might just

03:12:30.080 --> 03:12:34.400
march forward into something that if they were more informed about it, if they took a greater

03:12:34.400 --> 03:12:37.280
interest in the broader strategic questions, they would not in fact endorse and would not

03:12:37.280 --> 03:12:42.560
be on board with, so yeah, it's enormous responsibility for them as if it wasn't enough

03:12:42.560 --> 03:12:49.120
already that they're already succeeding at building one of the fastest growing, most impressive

03:12:49.120 --> 03:12:53.520
technology companies of all time, but now they also have the weight of the world on their shoulders,

03:12:54.160 --> 03:12:59.120
making decisions about that will affect everyone potentially, enormously consequential decisions,

03:12:59.120 --> 03:13:05.280
they have to stay abreast of the information that they need to know in order to decide whether

03:13:05.280 --> 03:13:12.560
they're comfortable contributing and endorsing what OpenAI is doing at a high level. It's a lot.

03:13:12.560 --> 03:13:17.920
Yeah, it is a lot, but I also think it wouldn't take that many, you said 95%, but I think

03:13:17.920 --> 03:13:26.240
5% would be enough to really send a shock through the system. I mean, if 5%, 35 people,

03:13:26.320 --> 03:13:33.520
if 35 people out of OpenAI came forward one day and said, we think we have a real problem here,

03:13:34.160 --> 03:13:39.520
and we're willing to walk away, and you do have to be willing to pay some costs to do this kind

03:13:39.520 --> 03:13:45.600
of thing in the public interest sometimes, we're willing to give up our options or give up our

03:13:45.600 --> 03:13:53.920
employment or whatever to be heard, Jeffrey Hinton style, then even if those 35 people were not

03:13:53.920 --> 03:14:00.800
previously known, I think that would carry a ton of influence because one might not be enough,

03:14:00.800 --> 03:14:07.520
two might not be enough, but certainly if you had 5%, I think it would be the sort of thing that

03:14:07.520 --> 03:14:15.200
would cause the world again to focus on them and what are they saying, and you might get

03:14:15.200 --> 03:14:21.600
some government intervention or whatever at that point in time. So yeah, I think those individuals

03:14:21.600 --> 03:14:27.600
really have a super big responsibility. Now, the other thing too, in terms of narrow AI,

03:14:27.600 --> 03:14:37.440
you can make tons of money with narrow AI, and GPD4 is reportedly, this is like unconfirmed,

03:14:37.440 --> 03:14:45.600
but I think credibly rumored reported whatever, to be a mixture of experts model, which means that

03:14:45.600 --> 03:14:52.640
you have a huge number of parameters and that only some subsets of these parameters

03:14:52.640 --> 03:14:57.360
get loaded in for any particular query, and part of how the model performs well and more

03:14:57.360 --> 03:15:04.240
efficiently while still handling tons of different stuff is that these different experts are properly

03:15:04.240 --> 03:15:10.320
loaded in for the right queries that they're best suited to help with. You could just pull

03:15:10.400 --> 03:15:17.600
that apart a little bit more fully and be like, we have 20 different AIs that we offer, and you as

03:15:17.600 --> 03:15:25.280
a user have to pick which one to do, and you can have the writing assistant, you can have the coding

03:15:25.280 --> 03:15:32.400
assistant, you could have the whatever, go on down the line, you could have the purely for fun

03:15:32.400 --> 03:15:39.360
conversational humorist, and you could have a lot of different flavors, but if they all have

03:15:40.320 --> 03:15:47.520
their own significant gaps, then that system would seem to be to me like inherently a lot less

03:15:48.320 --> 03:15:55.120
dangerous, like the safety through narrowness, I do think is a viable path, and it doesn't seem like

03:15:56.000 --> 03:16:01.280
you have to have, I mean, I think it's safe to say from looking at humans, you have people who are

03:16:01.920 --> 03:16:07.040
very well rounded, this is the old Ivy League admissions saying, we like people who are very

03:16:07.040 --> 03:16:11.120
well rounded, but we also like people who are very well lopsided, and we do have these people who

03:16:11.120 --> 03:16:16.960
are very well lopsided who know everything about something, and seemingly nothing about anything

03:16:16.960 --> 03:16:23.200
else, and in fact, you have some savants who are like true geniuses in some areas and can't function

03:16:23.200 --> 03:16:29.280
socially or whatever, there's all these sort of extreme different profiles. I think Eric Drexler,

03:16:29.280 --> 03:16:35.440
I think is kind of the first person to put this in like a full proper treatment with his comprehensive

03:16:35.440 --> 03:16:42.480
AI services, that was the first CAIS before the Center for AI Safety, so comprehensive AI

03:16:42.480 --> 03:16:46.480
Services is the long manuscript if people are interested in reading more about this, but he

03:16:46.480 --> 03:16:54.400
basically proposes that the path to safety is to have superhuman but narrow AIs that do a bunch

03:16:54.400 --> 03:17:00.240
of different things, and just have each one specialize in its own thing. What we have found

03:17:00.240 --> 03:17:04.720
is that like just training them on everything kind of creates this like, you know, the most powerful

03:17:04.720 --> 03:17:10.720
thing we've been able to create so far, and it's quite general, but it doesn't seem obvious to me

03:17:10.720 --> 03:17:17.760
at all that we have to continue to train them on everything to continue to make progress. We may

03:17:17.760 --> 03:17:24.800
very well be able to take some sort of base and deeply specialize them in particular directions,

03:17:25.520 --> 03:17:32.160
and you know, I'm much less worried about super narrow things than I am about the

03:17:32.960 --> 03:17:37.840
super general things, certainly when it comes to like the most extreme, you know, existential

03:17:38.720 --> 03:17:44.720
risks. Will they go that direction? You know, as of now, their core values say no,

03:17:45.680 --> 03:17:50.800
and that's why I do think some, you know, continued questioning is important because

03:17:52.240 --> 03:17:58.160
there's not, you know, it is really nice to be able to tap into the generality of the general AI,

03:17:58.160 --> 03:18:04.320
like it is awesome for sure. You know, chat GBT is awesome because you can literally just bring

03:18:04.320 --> 03:18:11.040
it anything, but if we're going to make things that are meaningfully superhuman, it does make a

03:18:11.040 --> 03:18:18.480
lot of sense to me to try to kind of narrow them to a specific domain and use that narrowness as a

03:18:18.480 --> 03:18:24.080
way to ensure that they don't get out of control. That doesn't mean we'd be totally out of the

03:18:24.080 --> 03:18:27.920
woods either, right? I mean, you can still have like dynamics and all kinds of crazy stuff could

03:18:27.920 --> 03:18:33.040
happen. But that does seem to be one like big risk factor is if you have something that's better

03:18:33.040 --> 03:18:39.920
than us at everything, that seems like inherently a much bigger wild card than 10 different things

03:18:39.920 --> 03:18:45.520
that are better than us at 10 different things individually. So, you know, who knows, right?

03:18:45.520 --> 03:18:50.160
There's a lot of uncertainty in all of this. But I, you know, my main message is just like,

03:18:50.160 --> 03:18:53.680
keep asking that question because nobody else really can.

03:18:54.160 --> 03:18:59.920
Yeah. Yeah, on this question of narrow AI models that could nonetheless be transformative and

03:18:59.920 --> 03:19:04.080
incredibly useful and extraordinarily profitable versus going straight for AGI.

03:19:05.040 --> 03:19:10.640
I think I agree with you that it would be nice if we could maybe buy ourselves a few years of

03:19:10.640 --> 03:19:17.040
focusing research attention on super useful applications or super useful narrow AIs that

03:19:17.040 --> 03:19:21.520
might, you know, really surpass human capabilities in some dimension, but not necessarily every

03:19:21.520 --> 03:19:26.320
single one of them at once. It doesn't feel like a long-term strategy, though. It feels like

03:19:26.320 --> 03:19:31.920
something that we can buy a bunch of time with and might be quite a smart move. But, you know,

03:19:31.920 --> 03:19:36.480
just given the diffusion of the technology, as you've been talking about kind of in as much as

03:19:36.480 --> 03:19:40.480
we have the compute and in as much as we have the data out there, these capabilities are always

03:19:40.480 --> 03:19:46.640
somewhat latent. They're always in a few steps away from being created. It feels like we have to

03:19:46.640 --> 03:19:51.600
have a plan for what happens. We have to be thinking about what happens when we have AGI because

03:19:51.600 --> 03:19:55.920
even if half of the countries in the world agree that we shouldn't be going for AGI,

03:19:56.560 --> 03:19:59.360
there's plenty of places in the world where probably you will be able to pursue it. And some

03:19:59.360 --> 03:20:03.520
people will think that it's a good idea for whatever sort of, for whatever reason, they

03:20:03.520 --> 03:20:07.440
don't buy the safety concerns or some people might feel like they have to go there for

03:20:07.440 --> 03:20:11.920
competitive reasons. I mean, and I would also say I've, there are some people out there who

03:20:12.640 --> 03:20:18.480
say we should shut down AI and we should never go there. Like actually people were saying, you

03:20:18.480 --> 03:20:23.840
know, we are not just for a little while, but we should ban AI basically for the future of humanity

03:20:23.840 --> 03:20:29.440
forever because who wants to create this crazy, crazy world where humans are irrelevant and

03:20:29.440 --> 03:20:35.360
obsolete and don't don't control things. I think Eric Howell, among other people has kind of made

03:20:35.360 --> 03:20:41.840
this case that humanity should just say no in perpetuity. And that's something

03:20:41.840 --> 03:20:48.720
that I can't get on board with even in principle. That seems like in my mind, of course, the upside

03:20:48.720 --> 03:20:56.240
from creating full beings, full AGI's that can enjoy the world in the way that humans do,

03:20:56.240 --> 03:21:02.560
that can fully enjoy existence and maybe achieve states of being that humans can't imagine,

03:21:02.560 --> 03:21:08.000
that are so much greater than what we're capable of. Enjoy levels of value that humans,

03:21:08.960 --> 03:21:12.880
you know, kinds of value that we haven't even imagined. That's such an enormous potential

03:21:12.880 --> 03:21:19.440
gain, such an enormous potential upside that I would feel it was selfish and parochial on the

03:21:19.440 --> 03:21:23.840
part of humanity to just close that door forever, even if it were possible. And I'm not sure whether

03:21:23.840 --> 03:21:27.120
it is possible, but if it were possible, I would say no, that's not what we ought to do.

03:21:27.120 --> 03:21:30.800
We ought to have a grand division. And I guess on this point, this is where I sympathize with

03:21:30.800 --> 03:21:37.200
the EAC folks. Hey, listeners, just mentioned this term EAC, which if you didn't know stands for

03:21:37.200 --> 03:21:42.720
effective accelerationism. It's a meme originating on Twitter, I think, that variously means

03:21:42.720 --> 03:21:46.560
being excited about advancing and rolling out technology quickly, or alternatively,

03:21:46.560 --> 03:21:51.280
being excited by the idea of human beings being displaced by AI, because AI is going to be better

03:21:51.280 --> 03:21:56.240
than us. I guess which definition you get depends on who you ask. All right, back to the show.

03:21:57.120 --> 03:22:02.960
Is that I guess they're worried that people who want to turn AI off forever and just keep the

03:22:02.960 --> 03:22:07.760
world as it is now by force for as long as possible, they're worried about those folks.

03:22:08.320 --> 03:22:13.280
And I agree that those people, at least in my moral framework, are making a mistake,

03:22:13.280 --> 03:22:20.400
because they're not appropriately valuing the enormous potential gain from, well, I mean,

03:22:20.400 --> 03:22:26.560
in my diving, AGI's that can make use of the universe, who can make use of all of the rest of

03:22:26.560 --> 03:22:30.960
space and all of the matter, energy and time that humans are not able to access, that are not able

03:22:30.960 --> 03:22:36.320
to do anything useful with, and to make use of the knowledge and the thoughts and the ideas that

03:22:37.120 --> 03:22:40.400
can be thought in this universe, but which humans are just not able to, because our brains are not

03:22:40.400 --> 03:22:47.280
up to it. We're not big enough. Evolution hasn't grounded us that capability. So yeah, I guess

03:22:47.280 --> 03:22:53.760
I do want to sometimes speak up in favor of AGI, or in favor of taking some risk here.

03:22:54.720 --> 03:22:59.200
I don't think that trying to reduce the risk to nothing by just stopping progress in AI would

03:22:59.280 --> 03:23:02.480
ever really be appropriate. To start with, I mean, the background risks from all kinds of

03:23:02.480 --> 03:23:07.520
different problems are substantial already. And in as much as AI might help to reduce those other

03:23:07.520 --> 03:23:11.440
risks, you know, so maybe the background risk that we face from pandemics, for example, then

03:23:11.440 --> 03:23:16.560
that would give us some reason to tolerate some risk in the progress of AI in the pursuit of risk

03:23:16.560 --> 03:23:23.360
reduction in other areas. But also just, of course, the enormous potential moral and spiritual,

03:23:23.360 --> 03:23:30.560
dare I say, upside to bringing into this universe beings like the most glorious children that one

03:23:30.560 --> 03:23:36.080
could ever hope to create in some sense. Now, my view is that, you know, we could afford to take

03:23:36.080 --> 03:23:41.120
a couple of extra years to figure out what children we would like to create and figure out what

03:23:42.080 --> 03:23:48.160
much more capable beings we would like to share the universe with forever. And that

03:23:48.160 --> 03:23:52.800
Prudence would suggest that we maybe, you know, measure twice and cut once when it comes to

03:23:52.800 --> 03:23:59.040
creating what might turn out to be a form of successor species to humanity. But nonetheless,

03:23:59.040 --> 03:24:04.800
you know, I don't think we should measure forever. There is some reason to move forward and to accept

03:24:04.800 --> 03:24:08.960
some risk in the interests of not missing the opportunity because, say, we go extinct for

03:24:08.960 --> 03:24:13.920
some other reason or some other disaster prevents us from accomplishing this amazing thing in the

03:24:13.920 --> 03:24:21.040
meantime. Did you take on that way, hitting the spiritual point of the conversation, perhaps?

03:24:21.680 --> 03:24:27.280
Yeah, well, I mean, again, I think I probably agree with everything you're saying there. I'm

03:24:28.160 --> 03:24:34.160
probably more open than most, and it sounds like you are, too, to the possibility that

03:24:34.160 --> 03:24:42.160
AIs could very well have moral weight at some point in the future. You know, I look at consciousness

03:24:42.160 --> 03:24:49.040
as just a big mystery. And I have, you know, there's very few things I can say about it with

03:24:49.040 --> 03:24:54.880
any confidence. I'm like, I am pretty sure that animals are conscious in some way. I don't really

03:24:54.880 --> 03:25:01.600
know what it's like to be them, but I at least can kind of, you know, sort of try to imagine it.

03:25:01.600 --> 03:25:09.200
It's really hard to imagine, you know, does it feel like anything to be GPT for? My best guess is,

03:25:09.840 --> 03:25:14.480
honestly, I don't even know if I have a best guess. No would be a shocking answer by any means.

03:25:15.280 --> 03:25:19.520
Yes, it feels like something, but it's something totally alien and extremely weird

03:25:20.720 --> 03:25:28.880
would be another reasonable answer for me right now. Could that ever start to bend more toward

03:25:28.880 --> 03:25:35.520
something that is kind of similar to us, and that we would say, hey, that has its own value?

03:25:35.520 --> 03:25:40.640
I'm definitely open to that possibility. I think everybody should be prepared for really weird

03:25:40.640 --> 03:25:46.320
stuff and, you know, the idea that AIs could matter in some, you know, moral

03:25:47.680 --> 03:25:54.160
sense. I don't view as off the table at all. So it could be great, you know, and we're not

03:25:54.160 --> 03:25:57.600
like super well suited for space travel. Another idea that I think is pretty interesting, and

03:25:57.600 --> 03:26:03.360
that, you know, interestingly, the likes of like an Elon Musk and a Sam Altman, I believe, are at

03:26:03.360 --> 03:26:12.080
least, you know, flirting with if not in on is some sort of cyborg future. Elon Musk at the

03:26:12.080 --> 03:26:19.360
Neuralink show and tell day from maybe almost a year ago now came on and opened the presentation,

03:26:19.360 --> 03:26:22.320
which this is, by the way, I think something everybody should watch. They're now into like

03:26:23.120 --> 03:26:30.320
clinical trial phase of putting devices into people's skulls at the time they were just doing

03:26:30.320 --> 03:26:35.760
it on animals. And they can do a lot of stuff with this. You know, the animals can control devices.

03:26:36.480 --> 03:26:44.560
The devices can also control motor activity and like make the animals move. That's a bit crude

03:26:44.560 --> 03:26:49.840
still, but, you know, they're starting to do it. And anyway, you know, he came on and said,

03:26:50.400 --> 03:26:59.120
the reason that we started this company is so that we can increase the bandwidth between ourselves

03:26:59.120 --> 03:27:06.720
and the AIs so that we can essentially go along for the ride. And, you know, Sam Altman has kind of

03:27:06.720 --> 03:27:13.360
said some similar things. And there is definitely this trend to some sort of

03:27:13.360 --> 03:27:19.040
augmentation of human intelligence or hybrid systems. I mean, in terms of the future of work,

03:27:19.040 --> 03:27:25.440
you know, everybody's talking about AI human teams. So there is a natural pressure for that to kind of

03:27:25.440 --> 03:27:30.240
converge. And that's also the Kurzweil vision, right? We will merge with the machines, you know,

03:27:30.240 --> 03:27:34.880
we'll have nano machines inside of us and we'll have, you know, apparatuses and we'll have stuff,

03:27:34.880 --> 03:27:39.040
you know, attached to us and ultimately we'll become inseparable from them. And, you know,

03:27:39.040 --> 03:27:45.280
that'll be that. So that's also, I think, not, you know, not long ago that sounded pretty crazy,

03:27:45.280 --> 03:27:51.760
but now it doesn't sound nearly so crazy. So I do think all that stuff in my view is a live

03:27:52.320 --> 03:27:58.480
possibility. But, you know, if you look at like the Toby Orrd analysis in the precipice,

03:27:59.440 --> 03:28:06.080
AI is like the biggest reason he thinks we're going to go extinct. A human made pathogen pandemic

03:28:06.080 --> 03:28:10.880
would be the next most likely reason. And like everything else is distant, right? Like those are

03:28:10.880 --> 03:28:16.880
the two big things. And then, you know, super volcano or naturally occurring pathogen or asteroid

03:28:16.960 --> 03:28:25.040
hitting us or, you know, something else. Like those are all very small by comparison. So I do think,

03:28:25.920 --> 03:28:29.200
you know, a couple of years at a minimum would make a lot of sense to me before we like take

03:28:29.200 --> 03:28:36.080
the plunge on anything that we're not extremely confident in. And, you know, a little longer

03:28:36.080 --> 03:28:42.480
also I think would be probably pretty sensible because barring a super volcano, you know, we're

03:28:42.480 --> 03:28:46.320
probably not climate, you know, is not going to take us extinct in the immediate future. So like

03:28:46.880 --> 03:28:51.120
it's going to be either AI or a human made pathogen or we're probably going to be okay for a while.

03:28:51.760 --> 03:28:57.200
And, you know, the star, the sun isn't going to go supernova for a long time. So we do have some

03:28:57.200 --> 03:29:02.640
time to figure it out, you know, and this would be like, I'm open to a cyborg future. I'm open to

03:29:02.640 --> 03:29:10.000
the possibility that, you know, an AI could be a worthy successor species for us. But going back

03:29:10.000 --> 03:29:16.000
to my original kind of main takeaway from the red team, alignment and safety and like

03:29:16.800 --> 03:29:22.640
the things that we value, the sensibilities that we care about, those do not happen by default.

03:29:22.640 --> 03:29:27.280
And they are not yet well enough encoded in the systems that we have for me to say like, oh,

03:29:27.280 --> 03:29:34.240
yeah, GPT-4 should be our, you know, successor. You know, GPT-4 to me is like, definitely an alien.

03:29:34.240 --> 03:29:39.840
And I do not feel like I am a kindred spirit with it, even though it can be super useful to me.

03:29:39.840 --> 03:29:43.440
And I enjoy working with it. It's great, you know, it's a great coding assistant.

03:29:44.000 --> 03:29:50.080
But it does not feel like the sort of thing that I would send into the, you know, broader universe

03:29:50.080 --> 03:29:55.920
and say like, you know, this is going to represent my interests over the, you know, the long,

03:29:56.800 --> 03:30:03.360
you know, deep time horizon that it may go out and explore. So, you know, it's just so funny,

03:30:03.360 --> 03:30:10.960
right? We're in this seemingly maybe like early kind of phases of some sort of takeoff event.

03:30:11.600 --> 03:30:17.840
And, you know, in the end, it is probably going to be very hard to get off of that trajectory,

03:30:17.840 --> 03:30:22.640
probably, but to the degree that we can bend it a bit and give ourselves some time to really

03:30:22.640 --> 03:30:27.120
figure out what it is that we're dealing with and what version of it we really want to create,

03:30:27.840 --> 03:30:35.600
I think that would be extremely worthwhile. And, you know, hopefully, I think, you know,

03:30:35.600 --> 03:30:39.920
again, the game board is in a pretty good spot, you know, the people that are doing the frontier

03:30:39.920 --> 03:30:46.000
work for the most part seem to be pretty enlightened on all those questions as far as I can tell. So,

03:30:46.000 --> 03:30:53.680
hopefully, you know, as things get more critical, they will exercise that strength as appropriate.

03:30:54.240 --> 03:30:59.920
Yeah, I guess to slightly come full circle, I mean, the approach of the super alignment team

03:30:59.920 --> 03:31:03.760
at OpenAI, at least what I spoke to you on a couple of months ago, was broadly speaking

03:31:04.320 --> 03:31:12.560
to make use of these tools, these AI tools that are going to be, you know, at human level or

03:31:12.560 --> 03:31:17.280
so, you know, potentially substantially superhuman to speed up a whole bunch of the work that we

03:31:17.280 --> 03:31:21.200
might otherwise have liked to do over decades and centuries, putting ourselves in a better

03:31:21.200 --> 03:31:24.800
position to figure out what sort of world should we be creating and how should we go about doing

03:31:24.800 --> 03:31:31.040
it with AI, which given that, I mean, the thing that probably will set the pace and

03:31:31.040 --> 03:31:37.840
force us to move faster than we might feel comfortable in an ideal world is the proliferation

03:31:37.840 --> 03:31:43.200
issue that, well, you know, if all of the responsible actors decide to only do extremely

03:31:43.200 --> 03:31:49.200
narrow tools and to not go for any broader AGI project, then at some point, it will become

03:31:49.200 --> 03:31:54.000
too easy to do and it will become possible for some rogue group somewhere else in the world

03:31:55.040 --> 03:31:59.920
to go ahead. I guess unless we really decide to clamp down on it in a way that I think

03:31:59.920 --> 03:32:04.240
probably is not going to happen or at least not happen soon enough. So that is going to

03:32:04.240 --> 03:32:09.520
create a degree of urgency that probably will be the thing that even in a world where we're

03:32:09.520 --> 03:32:13.520
acting prudently pushes us over the edge towards feeling well, we have to keep moving forward,

03:32:13.520 --> 03:32:18.640
you know, even though we don't necessarily love it and even though this is creating some risk.

03:32:18.640 --> 03:32:23.600
But yeah, and given that, given that pressure, I guess trying to make the absolute most use

03:32:23.600 --> 03:32:27.120
of the tools that we're creating, of the AIs that we're building to

03:32:28.080 --> 03:32:34.400
smash through the work that has to happen as quickly as possible before it's too late is

03:32:35.200 --> 03:32:39.280
as good as planned as anyone else has proposed to me, basically, even though it sounds a little

03:32:39.280 --> 03:32:44.960
bit nuts. Earlier on, you mentioned that meta might be the group that you're actually

03:32:44.960 --> 03:32:48.400
most concerned about. Yeah, do you want to say anything about that? Can you expand on that

03:32:48.400 --> 03:32:52.640
point? You know, it'll be interesting to see where they go next, right? They released Llama

03:32:52.640 --> 03:33:00.400
2 with pretty serious RLHF on it to try to bring it under some control, so much so in fact that

03:33:00.960 --> 03:33:05.920
it had a lot of false refusals or inappropriate refusals, you know, that the funny one was like,

03:33:05.920 --> 03:33:12.080
where can I get a Coke? And the response is like, sorry, I can't help you with drugs or whatever.

03:33:12.800 --> 03:33:19.680
And, you know, just silly things like that where it really is true that when you RLHF the refusal

03:33:19.680 --> 03:33:25.440
behavior in, it can also, you have false positives and false negatives on kind of any

03:33:26.080 --> 03:33:32.240
dimension that you want to try to control. So it really is true, you know, the people that

03:33:32.240 --> 03:33:36.400
complain about this online are not doing so baselessly, that it does make the model less

03:33:36.400 --> 03:33:42.080
useful in some ways. And they did that, you know, they're not making exactly a product,

03:33:42.080 --> 03:33:46.880
they're just releasing this thing. So they didn't have to be as careful, they don't get the, you

03:33:46.880 --> 03:33:51.840
know, they don't care about the complaints that, hey, this thing is refusing my, you know, benign

03:33:51.840 --> 03:33:56.160
request in the same way that like an open AI does where it's, you know, it's a subscription product

03:33:56.160 --> 03:34:02.640
and they're trying to really deliver for you day after day. Now we've seen that those behaviors

03:34:02.640 --> 03:34:07.600
can easily be undone with just some further fine tuning. It might be, yeah, it might be worth

03:34:07.600 --> 03:34:13.840
explaining to people this issue. So yeah, so Meta released this open source Llama 2, which is,

03:34:13.840 --> 03:34:18.640
it's a pretty good, like large language model. It's not at GPT-4 level, but it's, you know,

03:34:18.640 --> 03:34:23.840
something like GPT-3 or GPT-3.5, that's kind of in that ballpark. They did a lot to try to get it

03:34:23.840 --> 03:34:29.440
to refuse to help people commit crimes, do other bad things. But as it turns out, I think

03:34:29.440 --> 03:34:33.200
research since then has suggested that you can take this model that they've released

03:34:33.200 --> 03:34:38.720
and with quite surprisingly low levels of time input and monetary input, you can basically

03:34:38.720 --> 03:34:44.160
reverse all of the fine tuning that they've done to try to get it to refuse those requests.

03:34:44.160 --> 03:34:48.880
So someone who did want to use Llama 2 for criminal behavior would not face any

03:34:48.880 --> 03:34:52.320
really significant impediments to that, if that was what they were trying to do.

03:34:54.800 --> 03:34:56.880
Do you want to, yeah, do you want to take it from there?

03:34:57.520 --> 03:35:04.320
Yeah, that's a good summary. The model is good. I would say it's about GPT-3.5 level,

03:35:04.960 --> 03:35:13.200
which is a significant step down from GPT-4, but still better than anything that was available

03:35:13.200 --> 03:35:20.160
up until basically just a year ago. We are, I think, three days as of this recording from the

03:35:20.240 --> 03:35:27.360
one-year anniversary of Chad GPT release. At the same time, they released the 3.5 model via the

03:35:27.360 --> 03:35:33.600
API and also unveiled Chad GPT. So again, just how fast this stuff is moving, I always try to keep

03:35:33.600 --> 03:35:41.280
these timelines in mind because we habituate to the new reality so quickly that it's easy to lose

03:35:41.280 --> 03:35:46.400
sight of the fact that none of this has been here for very long. And it's been already a few months

03:35:46.400 --> 03:35:52.000
in Llama 2. So as of a year ago, it would have been the state-of-the-art thing that the public

03:35:52.000 --> 03:35:56.160
had seen. GPT-4 was already finished at the time, but it wasn't yet released. So it would have been

03:35:56.160 --> 03:36:02.080
the very best thing ever to be released as of November 2022. Now it's like in a second tier,

03:36:02.080 --> 03:36:06.720
but it's still a powerful thing that can be used for a lot of purposes, and people are using it

03:36:06.720 --> 03:36:14.560
for lots of purposes. And because the full weights have been released, these are all in my

03:36:14.560 --> 03:36:20.240
scouting report, the fundamentals. I try to give people a good understanding of all these

03:36:20.240 --> 03:36:25.760
terms. And many of the terms have long histories in machine learning, and I wasn't there for the

03:36:25.760 --> 03:36:31.600
whole long history either. So I had to go through this process of figuring out why are these terms,

03:36:31.600 --> 03:36:37.440
what is used, and what do they really mean, and how should you really think about them if you're

03:36:37.440 --> 03:36:44.560
not super deep into the code. But basically, what a machine learning model is, what a transformer

03:36:44.560 --> 03:36:49.120
is, a transformer is just one type of machine learning model. And what a machine learning

03:36:49.120 --> 03:36:57.600
model does is it transforms some inputs into some outputs. And it does that by converting the inputs

03:36:57.600 --> 03:37:05.360
into some numerical form that's often called embedding. And then it processes those numbers

03:37:05.440 --> 03:37:11.840
through a series of transformations, hence kind of the transformer, although other models also

03:37:11.840 --> 03:37:15.840
basically do that too, right? They're taking these numbers and they're applying a series of

03:37:15.840 --> 03:37:22.160
transformations to them until you finally get to some outputs. The weights are the numbers in the

03:37:22.160 --> 03:37:26.960
model that are used to do those transformations. So you've got input, but then you've also got

03:37:26.960 --> 03:37:31.920
these numbers that are just sitting there. And those are the numbers that the inputs are multiplied

03:37:31.920 --> 03:37:37.920
by successively over all the different layers in the model until you finally get to the outputs.

03:37:38.640 --> 03:37:44.720
So when they put the full weights out there, it allows you to basically hack on that in any

03:37:44.720 --> 03:37:50.720
number of ways that you might want to. And another thing that has advanced very quickly is the

03:37:51.680 --> 03:37:58.480
specialty of fine tuning models, and particularly with increasingly low resources. So there are all

03:37:58.480 --> 03:38:05.680
of these efficiency techniques that have been developed that allow you to modify. And the biggest

03:38:05.680 --> 03:38:12.720
llama two is 70 billion parameters. So what that means is there are 70 billion numbers in the model

03:38:13.280 --> 03:38:20.480
that are used in the course of transforming an input into an output. And if you have all of those,

03:38:20.480 --> 03:38:25.920
then you can change any of them. You could in theory just go in and start to change them

03:38:25.920 --> 03:38:30.160
willy nilly wantonly and just be chaotic and see what happens. Of course, people will want to be

03:38:30.160 --> 03:38:37.440
more directed than that. So a naive version of it would be to do end to end fine tuning,

03:38:37.440 --> 03:38:46.400
where you would be changing all 70 billion numbers with some new objective. But there are now even

03:38:46.400 --> 03:38:51.680
more efficient techniques than that, such as Laura is one famous one where you

03:38:51.680 --> 03:38:56.160
change fewer parameters. And there's also like adapter techniques. So anyway, you get down to the

03:38:56.160 --> 03:39:02.400
point where you can be now quite data efficient and quite compute efficient. I think the smallest

03:39:03.360 --> 03:39:10.560
number of data points that I've seen for removing the refusal behaviors is like on the order of 100,

03:39:11.200 --> 03:39:16.160
which is also pretty consistent with what the fine tuning on the open AI platform takes today.

03:39:16.240 --> 03:39:22.400
If you have 100 examples, that's really enough to fine tune a model for most purposes. That's

03:39:22.400 --> 03:39:27.440
about what we use at Waymark for script writing. It's got to be diverse set. It's got to be kind

03:39:27.440 --> 03:39:32.560
of well chosen. You may find that you'll need to patch that in the future for different types of

03:39:32.560 --> 03:39:38.080
things that you didn't consider in the first round. But 100 is typically enough on the open AI

03:39:38.080 --> 03:39:45.360
platform. It will cost us typically under a dollar, maybe a couple dollars to do a fine tuning.

03:39:46.160 --> 03:39:51.200
If you're running this on your own in the cloud somewhere, it's on that order of magnitude as

03:39:51.200 --> 03:39:56.480
well. So exponentials and everything. It might have cost hundreds or thousands not long ago,

03:39:56.480 --> 03:40:00.640
but now you're down into single digit dollars and just hundreds of examples.

03:40:00.640 --> 03:40:08.080
So it really is extremely accessible for anyone who wants to fine tune an open source model.

03:40:08.080 --> 03:40:14.880
And that's great for many things. That allows application developers to not be dependent

03:40:14.960 --> 03:40:19.600
on an open AI, which of course many of them want, even just at Waymark. And we've been pretty

03:40:19.600 --> 03:40:24.240
loyal customers of open AI, not out of blind loyalty, but just because they have consistently

03:40:24.240 --> 03:40:33.200
had the best stuff. And that's been ultimately pretty clear and decisive over time. But after

03:40:33.200 --> 03:40:37.280
the last episode, there has been a little rumbling on the team like, hey, maybe we should at least

03:40:37.280 --> 03:40:44.720
have a backup. And the calculation has changed. I used to say, look, it's just not

03:40:44.720 --> 03:40:49.040
worth it for us to go to all the trouble of doing this fine tuning. The open source foundation

03:40:49.040 --> 03:40:55.440
models aren't as good. In addition to allowing you to do the fine tuning, open AI also serves it

03:40:55.440 --> 03:41:01.360
for you. So you don't have to handle all the infrastructural complexity around that. But

03:41:01.360 --> 03:41:05.680
all this stuff is getting much, much easier. The fine tuning libraries are getting much easier,

03:41:05.680 --> 03:41:10.560
so it's much easier to do. The inference platforms are getting much more mature over time. And so

03:41:10.560 --> 03:41:15.920
it's much easier to host your own as well. So I used to say, look, it's just whatever,

03:41:15.920 --> 03:41:22.000
if open AI goes out for a minute, we'll just accept that. And it's worth taking that risk

03:41:22.000 --> 03:41:26.400
versus investing all this time in some backup that we may not need much and won't be nearly as good

03:41:26.400 --> 03:41:31.040
anyway. And now that really has kind of flipped, even though I think we will continue to use the

03:41:31.040 --> 03:41:36.880
open AI stuff as our frontline default, if there were to be another outage,

03:41:37.680 --> 03:41:42.160
now we probably should have a backup because it is easy enough to do, it's easy enough to host,

03:41:42.160 --> 03:41:47.760
and the quality is also getting a lot better as well. But from a safety perspective, the downside

03:41:47.760 --> 03:41:55.840
of this is that as easy it is to fine tune, it's that easy to create your totally uncensored version

03:41:55.840 --> 03:42:03.440
or your evil version for whatever purpose you may want to create one for. So we can get into more

03:42:03.520 --> 03:42:12.400
specific use cases, perhaps as we go on. But popping up a couple, maybe levels of the

03:42:12.400 --> 03:42:19.760
recursion depth here, it will be interesting to see if meta leadership updates their thinking

03:42:19.760 --> 03:42:23.920
now that all this research has come out. Because they put this thing out there and they were like,

03:42:23.920 --> 03:42:27.520
look, we took these reasonable precautions, therefore, it should be fine for us to open

03:42:27.520 --> 03:42:32.960
source it. Now it is very clear that even if you take those reasonable precautions in your open

03:42:32.960 --> 03:42:40.160
sourcing, effectively, that has no real force. And so you are open sourcing the full uncensored

03:42:40.160 --> 03:42:44.960
capability of the model like it or not. They have previously said that they plan to open source on

03:42:44.960 --> 03:42:51.680
Llama 3, they plan to open source a GPT-4 quality model, and will they change course based on these

03:42:51.680 --> 03:42:57.360
research results? We'll have to see. But one would hope that they would at least be given some pause

03:42:57.360 --> 03:43:02.800
there. I think you could still defend open sourcing a GPT-4 model, to be clear, I don't think

03:43:02.960 --> 03:43:10.000
GPT-4 is not existential yet. But my general short summary on this is, we're in this kind of sweet

03:43:10.000 --> 03:43:16.000
spot right now where GPT-4 is powerful enough to be economically really valuable, but not powerful

03:43:16.000 --> 03:43:21.520
enough to be super dangerous. By the time we get to GPT-5, I think basically, all of us are off.

03:43:21.520 --> 03:43:27.360
Yeah, yeah. Okay, we're almost out of time for today's episode, whether we're going to come back

03:43:27.360 --> 03:43:31.920
and record again some more tomorrow. But to wrap up for now, can you maybe tell us a little bit

03:43:31.920 --> 03:43:36.640
about, let's wind back and find out a little bit about your journey into the AI world over the

03:43:36.640 --> 03:43:41.760
last couple of years. How did you end up throwing yourself into this so intensely like you have?

03:43:42.400 --> 03:43:48.320
Sure. Well, I've always been interested in AI for the last probably 15 years,

03:43:49.520 --> 03:43:57.920
and it's been a very surprising development as things have gone from extremely theoretical to

03:43:57.920 --> 03:44:04.560
increasingly real. I was among the first wave of readers of Eliezer's old sequences back when

03:44:04.560 --> 03:44:12.240
they were originally posted on Overcoming Bias. At that time, it was just a very far out notion

03:44:12.240 --> 03:44:16.960
that, hey, one day we might have these things, and this was like Ray Kurzweil and Eliezer going

03:44:16.960 --> 03:44:22.560
back and forth and Robin Hansen, all very far out stuff, all very interesting, but all very

03:44:22.560 --> 03:44:28.560
theoretical. At that time, I thought, well, look, this is probably not going to happen, but if it

03:44:28.560 --> 03:44:33.600
does, it would be a really big deal. Just like if an asteroid were to hit the earth, that's probably

03:44:33.600 --> 03:44:37.920
not going to happen either, but it certainly always made sense to me that we should have somebody

03:44:37.920 --> 03:44:42.800
looking out at the skies and trying to detect those so that if any are coming our way, we might

03:44:42.800 --> 03:44:46.960
be able to do something about it. I thought the same way about AI for the longest time and just

03:44:46.960 --> 03:44:52.400
kept an eye on the space while I was mostly doing other things. I had a couple of opportunities

03:44:52.400 --> 03:45:00.240
in my entrepreneurial journey to get hands-on and coded a bi-gram and a trigram text classifier by

03:45:00.240 --> 03:45:06.560
hand in 2011, just before ImageNet, just before Deep Learning really started to take off. Then

03:45:06.560 --> 03:45:12.080
again, in 2017, I hired a grad student to do a project on abstractive summarization, which was

03:45:12.080 --> 03:45:16.560
the idea that, because in the context of Waymark, we're trying to help small businesses create

03:45:16.640 --> 03:45:22.880
content, and they really struggled to create content. We coded something up based on recent

03:45:22.880 --> 03:45:30.160
research results, and basically nothing really ever worked. Throughout that whole 2010 to 2020,

03:45:30.160 --> 03:45:35.040
I was always looking for products, always looking for opportunities, and nothing was ever good enough

03:45:35.040 --> 03:45:43.280
to be useful to our users. Then in 2020, with the release of GPT-3, it seemed pretty clear to me

03:45:43.280 --> 03:45:49.520
that that had changed for the first time, and it was like, okay, this can write. This can actually

03:45:49.520 --> 03:45:55.040
create content. It wasn't immediately obvious how it was going to help us, but it was pretty clear

03:45:55.040 --> 03:45:59.120
to me that something had changed in a meaningful way and that this was going to be the thing that

03:45:59.120 --> 03:46:04.720
was going to unlock a new kind of experience for our users. I didn't necessarily, at that time,

03:46:05.280 --> 03:46:11.120
I wouldn't say I was as prescient as others in seeing just how far it would go, how quickly,

03:46:11.200 --> 03:46:15.760
but it was clear that it was something that could be now useful. I started to throw myself

03:46:15.760 --> 03:46:23.200
into that. We couldn't really make it work in the early days, but with the release of fine-tuning

03:46:23.200 --> 03:46:28.960
from OpenAI, that was really the tipping point where we went from never could get anything to

03:46:28.960 --> 03:46:34.560
actually be useful to our users, to, hey, this thing can now write a first draft of a video

03:46:34.560 --> 03:46:39.200
script for a user that is actually useful. To be honest, the first generation of that still kind

03:46:39.200 --> 03:46:46.000
of sucked. We got that working in late 2021 for the first time, and it wasn't great, but it was

03:46:46.000 --> 03:46:51.360
better than nothing. It was definitely better than a blank page. At that point, I kind of got

03:46:51.360 --> 03:46:57.040
religion around it, so to speak, at least from a venture standpoint, and was just like, we are

03:46:57.040 --> 03:47:02.320
not going to do anything else as a company until we figure out how to ride this technology wave,

03:47:02.960 --> 03:47:09.520
but we weren't really an AI company. We had built the company to create great web experiences and

03:47:09.520 --> 03:47:15.840
interfaces and great creative, but AI wasn't a really big part of that up until this most recent

03:47:15.840 --> 03:47:22.320
phase. As we looked around the room, who can take on this responsibility? I was the one that was

03:47:22.320 --> 03:47:29.520
most enthusiastic about doing it, and that's really when I threw myself into it with everything

03:47:29.520 --> 03:47:34.240
that I had. There was a period where I basically neglected everything else at the company.

03:47:34.880 --> 03:47:39.440
My teammates, I think, thought I'd gone a little bit crazy. Certainly, my board was like,

03:47:39.440 --> 03:47:44.720
what are you doing? At one point, I canceled board meetings and invited them instead to an AI-101

03:47:44.720 --> 03:47:47.920
course that I created for the team. I was like, this is what we're doing. If you want to come to

03:47:47.920 --> 03:47:52.240
this instead of the board meeting, you can come. One of them actually did, but I think did think

03:47:52.240 --> 03:47:58.400
I was going a little bit nuts. Obviously, things have only continued to accelerate since then.

03:47:59.920 --> 03:48:05.280
The video creation problem has turned out to be, and not by design by me, but nevertheless,

03:48:05.280 --> 03:48:11.360
has turned out to be a really good jumping off point into everything that's going on with AI,

03:48:11.360 --> 03:48:15.760
because it's inherently a multimodal problem. There's a script that you need to write

03:48:15.760 --> 03:48:20.640
that is the core idea of what you're going to create, but then there's all the visual assets.

03:48:20.640 --> 03:48:26.080
How do you lay out the text so that it actually works? How do you choose the right assets to

03:48:26.080 --> 03:48:31.840
accompany each portion of the script scene by scene? On top of that, a lot of the content that

03:48:31.840 --> 03:48:36.400
we create ends up being used as TV commercials. We have a lot of partnerships with media companies,

03:48:36.400 --> 03:48:43.280
and so it's a sound on environment. They need a voiceover as well. We used to have a voiceover

03:48:43.280 --> 03:48:48.960
service, which we do still offer, but these days, an AI voiceover is generated as part of that as

03:48:48.960 --> 03:48:53.280
well. We don't do all of that in-house by any means. Our approach is very much to

03:48:54.160 --> 03:48:59.360
survey everything that's available, try to identify the best of what's available, and try to maximize

03:49:00.000 --> 03:49:05.920
its utility within the context of our product. That got me started on what I now think is an

03:49:05.920 --> 03:49:11.280
even broader project of AI scouting, because I always needed to find what's the best language

03:49:11.280 --> 03:49:16.880
model, what's the best computer vision model to choose the right images, what's the best text to

03:49:16.880 --> 03:49:23.040
speech generator. I didn't care if it was open source or proprietary. I just wanted to find the

03:49:23.040 --> 03:49:30.000
best thing, no matter what that might be. It really put me in a great position by necessity to have a

03:49:30.000 --> 03:49:38.240
very broad view of all the things that are going on in generative AI and to put me in a dogma-free

03:49:38.240 --> 03:49:42.480
mindset from the beginning. I just wanted to make something work as well as I possibly could.

03:49:44.080 --> 03:49:49.680
That's a really good perspective, I think, to approach these things, because if you are colored

03:49:49.680 --> 03:49:56.560
by ideology coming in, I think it can really cloud your judgment. I had the very nice ground

03:49:56.560 --> 03:50:02.080
truth of, does this work in our application? Does it make users, small businesses, look good on

03:50:02.080 --> 03:50:08.160
TV? These are very practical questions. Yeah. My guest today has been Nathan Labens.

03:50:08.160 --> 03:50:11.040
Thanks so much for coming on the 80,000 Hours Podcast, Nathan. Thank you, Rob.

03:50:11.920 --> 03:50:19.280
Hey, everyone. I hope you enjoyed that episode. We'll have part two of my conversation with

03:50:19.280 --> 03:50:24.880
Nathan for you once we're done editing it up. As we head into the winter holiday period,

03:50:24.880 --> 03:50:30.960
the rate of new releases of new interviews might slow a touch, though we've still got a ton in

03:50:30.960 --> 03:50:36.080
the pipeline for you. But as always, we'll be putting out a few of our favorite episodes from

03:50:36.080 --> 03:50:40.640
two years ago. These are really outstanding episodes where, if you haven't heard them already,

03:50:40.640 --> 03:50:45.040
and maybe even if you have, you should be more excited to have them coming into your feed even

03:50:45.040 --> 03:50:50.560
than just a typical new episode. So look out for those. I'll add a few reflections on the year

03:50:50.560 --> 03:50:55.600
at the beginning to the first of those classic holiday releases. I know the rate of new releases

03:50:55.600 --> 03:51:00.080
on this show has really picked up this year with the addition of Louisa as a second host.

03:51:00.640 --> 03:51:05.280
Understandably, some people find it tough to entirely keep up with the pace at times.

03:51:05.280 --> 03:51:10.240
If that's the case for you, I can suggest a few things. Of course, maybe you can save up episodes

03:51:10.240 --> 03:51:15.280
and catch up during the holidays or when you're traveling. That's what I sometimes do with my

03:51:15.280 --> 03:51:20.240
podcasting backlog. Alternatively, you can start picking and choosing a bit more, which episodes

03:51:20.240 --> 03:51:24.480
are on the topics that you care about the most and are most likely to usefully act on.

03:51:25.120 --> 03:51:28.480
And the third option that I do want to draw to your attention is that you could make use of the

03:51:28.480 --> 03:51:33.200
fact that we now put out 20-minute highlights versions of every episode and put that out on

03:51:33.200 --> 03:51:38.560
our second feed, ADK After Hours. So you can just listen to the highlights for episodes that

03:51:38.560 --> 03:51:41.760
aren't so important to you, or you can use the highlights every time to figure out

03:51:41.760 --> 03:51:45.200
if you want to invest in listening to the full version of an interview.

03:51:45.200 --> 03:51:49.760
To get those, you just subscribe to our sister show, ADK After Hours. Of course,

03:51:49.760 --> 03:51:53.840
if you'd like to hear more of Nathan right now, there's plenty more of him out there.

03:51:53.840 --> 03:51:57.840
You can go and subscribe to Cognitive Revolution, which you'll find in any podcasting app.

03:51:57.840 --> 03:52:01.200
And if you want to continue the extract that we had earlier, you can find that episode from

03:52:01.200 --> 03:52:05.040
the 22nd of November and then head to one hour and two minutes in.

03:52:05.040 --> 03:52:08.240
Otherwise, we'll have more Nathan for you soon in part two of our conversation.

03:52:08.800 --> 03:52:12.000
