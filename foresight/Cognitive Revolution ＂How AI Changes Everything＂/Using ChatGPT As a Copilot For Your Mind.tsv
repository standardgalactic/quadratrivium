0	9000	When I have an article idea, I'll often start with just this like really messy document full of quotes and sentences and little like things that might go into it.
9000	15680	And then I'll be like, I don't even know where to start with this. This is crazy. And then I will just be like, can you put this into an outline?
15680	23400	And I'll just paste the entire document into chat GT and it'll often find an outline. And like the the outlines it comes up with are like really basic.
23520	34840	But sometimes I think what is one of the things is really good at is like pointing out the obvious solution that you missed because you're too like close to the problem.
34960	43560	Hello, and welcome to the cognitive revolution, where we interview visionary researchers, entrepreneurs and builders working on the frontier of artificial intelligence.
44160	53640	Each week, we'll explore their revolutionary ideas. And together, we'll build a picture of how AI technology will transform work, life and society in the coming years.
54120	57320	I'm Nathan LaBenz, joined by my co host, Eric Torenberg.
57920	65440	Hello, and welcome back to the cognitive revolution. Today, we're sharing an episode of the new podcast. How do you use chat GPT?
66120	74280	How do you use chat GPT is hosted by Dan shipper, founder and CEO of every a daily newsletter that promises the best business writing on the Internet.
75080	83360	In just his first few episodes, he's had guests on the show, including saw Hill, LaVingia, Matt Eliason, Linus Lee, and today yours truly.
84640	89280	This conversation is both extremely practical and a real exchange of ideas.
89960	96800	Coming into it, I had used chat GPT mostly for unfamiliar tasks where I really needed help orienting myself and getting started.
97320	101320	And of course, I've got great value from a wide range of different use cases.
102240	107200	But to be honest, I hadn't found chat GPT super helpful for my own writing process.
107640	113920	So I was really interested to learn more about the methods that Dan has developed to use chat GPT as a thought partner and a writing assistant.
114880	117840	Learning from him inspired me to do more of this for myself.
118240	122000	Toward the end of the episode, Dan asks me what I am most excited about next.
122160	129120	And I mentioned the new Mamba architecture and state space models more generally, which I honestly can't stop thinking and talking about.
129800	132280	We'll have a big episode on this coming very soon.
132640	143840	And I'm glad to report that I did use some of Dan's recommendations to help develop the strategy, the devices and the overall structure for that episode in a way that I did find legitimately very helpful.
144920	151400	One note before we get started, there are a few points in this episode where we each shared our screens to show off content visually.
151720	158520	And while I think you will be fine with just the audio version, if you want to see the visuals, you can check out the YouTube version of this episode.
159600	161560	Of course, there's always lots more to learn.
161560	167520	So if you like this sort of content, I encourage you to check out how do you use chat GPT with Dan Shipper.
167920	168680	Welcome to the show.
169520	170000	Thank you, Dan.
170000	170600	Great to be here.
170600	171360	I'm excited for this.
171840	172640	I'm excited too.
172920	175360	For people who don't know, you are the founder of Waymark.
175400	181440	You are the host of the excellent podcast, Cognitive Revolution, and you were a GPT for a red teamer.
181440	190720	So you were responsible or one of the people on a team of people who were trying to figure out how to make GPT for do bad stuff before it was released, which you had a really interesting tweet thread about.
191040	191360	I don't know.
191360	193720	I think a couple of weeks ago or two weeks ago, something like that.
194200	195640	So we're very excited to have you.
195640	199040	I think you'll have a lot of insights that I'm excited to share with everyone.
199680	215640	I think one of the things in thinking about your work that stands out and thinking about Cognitive Revolution, in particular, the podcast that you run, is I think you have this idea that one of the values of AI is in helping us to offload Cognitive Work.
215680	227640	So just like in the way that machines in the Industrial Revolution, we offloaded like manual physical labor, AI will augment or offload a lot of cognitive labor from humans.
227640	229760	And I wanted you to just talk about that.
230080	231600	Tell me more about what that means.
231600	233960	And then tell me, is that a good thing and where is it a good thing?
234640	235600	Well, that's a big question.
235640	243880	I would say I talk about AI doing work and helping us in a couple of different modes for starters.
244040	262640	We will probably spend most of our time today in what I call co-pilot mode, which is the chat GPT experience of you are as a human going through your life and going through your work and encountering situations where, especially as you get used to it, you realize, oh, AI can help me here.
263000	271160	So you make a conscious decision in real time to switch over to interacting with AI for a second or a minute or whatever to get the help that you need.
271600	272800	And then you proceed.
273440	278720	But you are the agent in that situation going around and pursuing your goals.
279160	282640	In contrast, the other mode that I think is also really interesting is delegation mode.
283200	287760	And that is where you are truly offloading a task.
287800	298080	And I always say the goal of delegation mode is to get the output to the point where it is consistent enough that you don't have to review every single output.
298920	306960	And if you can get there, then you can start to really shift work to AI in a way that you no longer have to do it.
307200	309760	And that can that can be useful in different kinds of ways, right?
309760	312680	The co-pilot mode is about helping you be better.
312680	317480	That's your classic symbiosis or intelligence augmentation.
318120	327840	And then the delegation mode is more like we can save a ton of time and money on things that used to be a pain in our butts, or we can scale things that are not currently
327840	331080	scalable. And there's a lot of that in the world, right?
331360	344520	I think almost everybody has things where they would say, you know, if you just ask the question, is there stuff that you could be doing that would be really valuable to have done, but you just don't have time to do it?
344640	347480	There's a lot of that that can be quite transformative.
348000	360720	In the middle, and what's kind of missing right now still is between co-pilot mode, where you're getting this kind of real time help and deciding how to work it into whatever you're doing.
361040	373440	And delegation mode on the other end in between is ad hoc delegation, where it's I'm going along, but I want to, ideally, I would like to delegate more and bigger sub tasks to AI on the fly.
373920	380040	And that's where we're not quite there yet. The agents probably can't do much in the way of a significant task.
380040	394280	So it's, you're still shoehorned into one of two scenarios where you're engaging with it in real time and getting help, or you're going through the process of doing a setup and doing a validation, setting up a workflow to where you can truly delegate.
394400	401320	And it's that in between that I think is probably that gap gets closed over the next year as agents, quote unquote, begin to work.
401560	405560	And then we can start to delegate bigger chunks of work on the fly.
406400	410360	The next question was, is it good? I don't know if I have a great answer to that. I think it's largely good.
410520	418480	It's I think it says it's good as long as it's it's good as long as humans stay in control of the overall dynamic.
418800	427600	And I'm definitely one who considers everything to be in play for the future, both on the positive side, I don't think it's crazy to think of a post scarcity world.
428200	442480	And on the negative side, to quote Sam Altman, I wouldn't rule out lights out for all of us. I think we are definitely playing with a force here that has the potential to be totally transformative in good and bad and probably a combination of ways.
443120	448400	I'm thrilled by how much more productive I can be. And that's some of the stuff that we'll get into in more detail.
448920	462000	I am thrilled by the prospect of having infinite access to expertise, and especially for people who have far less means than I do to have that kind of access to expertise.
462040	470440	I am a pretty privileged person who can go to the doctor without really thinking twice about taking the time off from work or what that's going to cost me or whatever.
470680	482480	Obviously, a lot of people don't have that luxury. I think there is a real way in which AI can cover a lot of those gaps, not fully yet, but already significantly and obviously more and more over time.
482760	488760	I think that kind of stuff is going to be potentially disruptive and maybe the source of a lot of political debates and challenges.
489240	493880	But anyway, yeah, there's there's so much upside, but I think there is very real risk.
493960	506640	And it's very easy to hold those two perspectives at the same time, to be just thrilled by the capability, but also to be always, always keeping in mind a sort of healthy fear.
507160	518560	I love that. I think that's such a rare perspective. And as humans, we just tend to collapse on one. Either it's horrible or it's great.
519000	528320	And then we have these camps. And I think, like, obviously, the wise perspective is there's going to be some really amazing stuff about this.
528360	534680	And there are dangers, like when technology changes society and change, it'll change our brains, like we will adapt to this.
534720	541800	And in the same way that it is adapting to us, that will change things and we'll need to, like, deal with the dangers that it presents.
541800	548320	I think that's a very wise perspective. And I ask that question, is it a good thing that cognitive work will be offloaded?
548320	557320	Because I think that there's good and bad. But one of the things that I feel is the fear scenario is like, is quite dominant for a lot of people.
557800	567400	And, and I think the people who are like anti fear or presenting a hopeful view are a little but they're a little bit too like rose colored glasses.
567800	585920	And I think finding real ways and real use cases for how offloading some of this cognitive work actually helps people is just like a really important part of creating a world where AI is a force for good or force for creativity,
585920	592000	rather than a world where it just replaces people or it creates dangers or there's all the bad scenarios.
592000	608800	And one of the things that I've felt going back to your kind of co pilot mode versus delegation mode point, one of the things that I felt is that AI reveals to me how much drudgery there is, even in highly valuable, highly creative knowledge work.
609600	619480	And that we sort of like lie to ourselves about the amount of drudgery because that work is so romantic compared to, I don't know, I don't know, working in a factory maybe or just any other kind of job.
619880	631480	And it's, it's easy to look at a lawyer and be like a lawyer's job is full of drudgery or whatever. But I write, I run a business. I have a YouTube show. Now I have a podcast. There's a lot of stuff that's like just pure drudgery of that.
631520	646720	And I find it really interesting because using chat GBT using AI tools more broadly, it has made me aware of how many repetitive or like just overall kind of brain dead things I have to do just to write something smart on the internet on every.
647160	655560	And once it's visible, I use AI for it. And then I don't have to think about it as much anymore. And I think that's a really cool thing.
656520	676080	Totally. For me, coding comes to mind most there when you talk about the drudgery of high value and again, pretty privileged work to be doing. But I'm not a full time coder have been for a couple short stretches in life, but more often I've been somebody who's dipped in and out of it.
676320	695340	And it is a real pain in the butt to have to Google everything. Obviously, different people have different strengths and weaknesses. I do not remember syntax super well. Sometimes if it's been a while, I'm like, wait a second, am I, is this am I remembering JavaScript or am I remembering Python?
695340	716260	Yeah, what exactly is going on here? Yeah. And so to be able to just have the thing type out even relatively simple stuff for me is a multiple x speed up often in terms of productivity improvements, often an improvement in just strict quality to compared to what I would have done on my own.
716460	734940	Yeah. And makes it so much easier to get into the mode in the first place. There's this kind of, I wouldn't even call this drudgery, but it's gearing up just like somehow getting my people talk about in birdwatching getting your eyes on really focusing on what are you seeing and trying to like get that detector right.
734940	746340	There's like a similar thing, at least for me in terms of getting into code mode. And it also just streamlines that tremendously, because next thing you know, it's writing the code and I'm reading the code reading the codes a lot easier than writing the code.
746700	763180	So I do find, yeah, just tremendous satisfaction, you know, pleasure in just seeing this stuff like outputted for me at superhuman pace better, better than me quality, maybe not superhuman quality, but super Nathan quality. It's awesome.
763420	788260	What you're making me think about is, because I think in large part, not all of it, but in large part what the current class, especially of text models are doing is different forms of summarizing and how like how much summarizing is involved in creative work and programming in writing in decision making a lot of it is just summarizing
788260	812380	like in programming, you're summarizing what you find on Google. You have to decide what to summarize and you have to summarize it in the right exact way for like your specific use case. But that's a lot of times what you're doing. Same thing for writing, like a lot of the stuff in my pieces are summaries of books that I've read or conversations I've had or ideas that I found somewhere else that I'm like stringing together in a sort of unique way.
812660	833580	And obviously, I still have to do the management overall management task of deciding which summaries to put in which order and like how they work or whatever but like a lot of it is summary. And I think that's a way that using these tools, you start to see the world a little bit differently and you're like, Oh yeah, there's a whole, there's a whole class of things I'm doing that are summaries that I don't have to do anymore. And I really think that's cool.
833580	862580	Yeah, I should be one of the areas where I have not adopted AI as much as I probably should have is in repurposing content, making more of what I do with the podcast, because I've put out a lot of episodes, there's a lot of stuff there. And we do use AI in our workflows to, for example, create the time stamp outline right of the different discussion topics at different times throughout the show. That's the most classic.
863580	892580	Summarization where I'm not looking for a lot of color commentary. It's literally just what was the topic at each time get it right. So we've got some stuff like that we go to pretty regularly. But I have not done as much as I probably could or should maybe this will be a New Year's resolution to bring that to all the different platforms. And it is I think it's an actually an interesting, it's partly a personal quirk. And it is also I think a limitation of the current language.
893580	922580	And I think that's one of the other models that I never quite feel like I want them to write as me. I'm very eager to hear your thoughts on how you relate to it in the writing process. Yeah, when I put something out in my own name, I basically don't use chat GBT at all for it. I can use it I find for like voice of the show if I want to do like that time stamp outline or just create a quick summary that's in kind of a neutral voice where it's not signed Nathan and isn't supposed to be like representing my perspective.
922580	937580	I haven't really had a great synthesis yet to help create stuff that I want to say in my own voice in my own name. So if you have tips on that, that would be something I would love to come away with a better plan of attack on because I'm not quite there.
937580	941580	Hey, we'll continue our interview in a moment after a word from our sponsors.

1032580	1040580	I do. I definitely do. I love it. I think it goes back again to when you talk about being a co-pilot.
1040580	1047580	I think that the failure mode is usually trying to use it when it's a little bit more in delegation mode.
1047580	1050580	Just go do this whole thing. That's when it doesn't really work.
1050580	1057580	But as a co-pilot, it really works incredibly well for specific micro tasks in writing.
1058580	1063580	First example, as I just brought up, everything is a summary.
1063580	1068580	I often have to explain an idea. I was writing a piece a couple months ago where I had to explain an idea.
1068580	1077580	I knew the idea. I was talking about SPF and FTX's collapse and how utilitarianism and effective altruism,
1077580	1080580	whether or not that philosophy contributed to the collapse.
1080580	1086580	In order to write that article, I had to summarize the main tenets of utilitarianism.
1086580	1090580	I studied philosophy in college and I've read a lot of Peter Singer's work.
1090580	1093580	I just generally know it, but I haven't written about that in a while.
1093580	1100580	Ordinarily, I would have had to spend three hours going back through all the different stuff to formulate my three or four-sentence summary.
1100580	1106580	I just asked Chatcha BT and it gave me the summary in the context that I needed it in three or four sentences.
1107580	1113580	I didn't use that wholesale, but it gave me basically the thing I needed to tweak it and put it into my voice.
1113580	1120580	That's a really simple example, but I think you can use it in all different parts in the writing process.
1120580	1127580	At the very beginning, I'll often just record myself on a walk, just spewing ideas and random thoughts reassociating.
1127580	1133580	Then I'll have it transcribe it and summarize it and pull out the main things and then it'll help me find little article ideas.
1134580	1143580	When I have an article idea, I'll often start with just this really messy document full of quotes and sentences and little things that might go into it.
1143580	1146580	Then I'll be like, I don't even know where to start with this. This is crazy.
1146580	1150580	Then I will just be like, can you put this into an outline?
1150580	1154580	I'll just paste the entire document into Chatcha BT and it'll often find an outline.
1154580	1158580	The outlines it comes up with are really basic.
1158580	1169580	I think one of the things that's really good at is pointing out the obvious solution that you missed because you're too close to the problem.
1169580	1177580	Of course, the outline for this article is set up the problem and then talk about the solution to the problem that you came up with or whatever.
1177580	1184580	That's such a common format for an article, but if you're in your head about it and you're being really precious,
1184580	1191580	it can be hard to be like, for this special article, it's going to be this basic thing that you've written a thousand times before, the same basic structure.
1191580	1201580	Then I think one of the other really great things is it's just incredibly good for helping you figure out what you're trying to express,
1201580	1210580	put into words what you're going for, and then also going through the different options of how to express what you want to express until you find something that exactly says the thing you want.
1210580	1213580	For example, trying to find exactly the right metaphor.
1213580	1216580	What kind of metaphor are you trying to find?
1216580	1218580	What's the idea you're trying to express?
1218580	1223580	Here's 50 different options of ways to express that with a metaphor.
1223580	1233580	49 of them will be trash and one of them will be amazing or one of them will push you in the direction of the one that you come up with is.
1233580	1235580	I have zillions of examples of that.
1235580	1243580	I find that ChatGBT, it's all over my writing, but none of the stuff that makes it into the writing I publish is wholesale from ChatGBT.
1243580	1245580	It's like doing some of those micro tasks for me all the time.
1245580	1247580	Yeah, that's interesting.
1247580	1250580	Some of the stuff that you mentioned there I have had some luck with.
1250580	1256580	The talking to it on a walk is quite helpful in some cases.
1256580	1262580	I've done a couple things where I tried to draft a letter and do, as you said, talk my way through it.
1262580	1263580	Here's what I want to say.
1263580	1265580	I'm writing here to this person.
1265580	1266580	Here's a little context.
1266580	1268580	Here's the key points I want to get across.
1268580	1269580	Can you do a draft?
1269580	1273580	And then iterating verbally on that draft.
1273580	1280580	A lot of times I'll follow up and be like, okay, that's pretty good, but you can give it pre-detailed feedback too.
1280580	1286580	The transcription in the app is so good that it is, again, point of privilege.
1286580	1289580	It understands me extremely well.
1289580	1295580	So I can literally just have to scroll through its first generation and say, in the first paragraph, I don't really want to say that.
1295580	1297580	It's more like this in the second paragraph.
1297580	1298580	More emphasis on this.
1298580	1299580	Add this detail.
1299580	1300580	Give it like eight things.
1300580	1303580	You could wish it would do a little bit better on the revision.
1303580	1313580	I've had a few moments there where at the end of that process, I have something like, all right, when I get back to the desk, it's not that far of a leap from that to the actual version that I'll use.
1313580	1315580	It's probably still underutilized for me.
1315580	1316580	I should go on more walks, honestly.
1316580	1319580	Get more time away from the screen.
1319580	1323580	Get the blood flowing a little bit and use a different modality.
1323580	1325580	The micro tasks, I should do more, though.
1325580	1336580	I think that's the tip that I'm taking here is, and there's a separation between, like, sometimes where I feel like it's hurting me is if I haven't...
1336580	1342580	And this doesn't even now start to happen in Gmail or anywhere where there's this auto-complete that's popping up.
1342580	1348580	Sometimes I'm on the verge of a thought that is really the thought that I'm trying to articulate.
1348580	1351580	And then this auto-complete comes up and it's like, that's not right.
1351580	1356580	But it can derail you at times where you're like, don't guess for me right now.
1356580	1358580	Let me get the core ideas down first.
1358580	1364580	If you don't have those core ideas, then for me, it's been a real struggle to get anything good.
1364580	1373580	But I think I've probably not done enough experimentation in the writing process of, okay, I do have some core ideas.
1373580	1378580	Can you help me order them, structure them, iterate on them?
1378580	1381580	Interestingly, I also do use it at the other end often.
1381580	1382580	Critique this.
1382580	1383580	Here's an email.
1383580	1384580	Here's a whatever.
1384580	1385580	Here's an intro to a podcast.
1385580	1386580	Critique it.
1386580	1392580	That could be really useful if critiques are usually worthy of consideration, at least, I would say.
1392580	1394580	Yeah, it truly is good at that.
1394580	1401580	We have multiple editors who are highly skilled and I still use it to be like, what do you think of this intro?
1401580	1404580	Because it's up at 2 a.m. when I'm a night before a deadline.
1404580	1406580	Yeah, it's real hard to beat the availability.
1406580	1409580	The responsiveness is clearly superhuman on that.
1409580	1410580	I think the writing stuff is really fun.
1410580	1416580	I would love to, if you're ready for it, I would love to start just diving into how you actually, how you use chatGBT.
1416580	1417580	Sure.
1417580	1421580	You sent me a doc with a bunch of historical chats and this is the first one.
1421580	1422580	Give us the setup.
1422580	1423580	What were you doing?
1423580	1428580	At what point were you like, oh, I need to go into chatGBT and then take us from there?
1428580	1441580	I am working as the AI advisor at a company called Athena, which was founded by a friend of mine named Jonathan.
1441580	1444580	Is this the virtual assistant company, the Thumbtack?
1444580	1445580	Yes.
1445580	1450580	He used one of the founders of Thumbtack and this is a different company, but founded on
1450580	1453580	some of the lessons that he learned in the Thumbtack experience.
1453580	1461580	He legendarily built up like a really amazing operation powered by contractors in the Philippines.
1461580	1471580	And that included hiring an assistant for himself and his role at Thumbtack, who became like a almost another key partner in his life over a long time.
1471580	1478580	And then Athena was built to essentially try to scale that magic for startup founders, executives in general.
1478580	1482580	They hire executive assistants in the Philippines.
1482580	1484580	They pay premium wage.
1484580	1487580	They're really focused on getting super high quality people.
1487580	1498580	And the idea is to empower the most ambitious and most high impact people by equipping them with this ability to delegate to their assistant in a transformative way.
1498580	1499580	Okay.
1499580	1501580	Now we're working on what does AI mean for us, right?
1501580	1504580	How do we bring that into the assistance work?
1504580	1511580	So one of the things I've done is train the assistance on the use of AI.
1511580	1517580	And that's been a fascinating experience, putting content together, examples, et cetera.
1517580	1526580	Another thing that I've done is just worked on building a number of kind of prototype demos for what the technology of the future might start to look like.
1526580	1535580	And this chat, which we call Athena chat, is basically our own custom in-house chat GPT is built on an open source project.
1535580	1537580	So I didn't have to code every line of it.
1537580	1544580	But it is amazing how quickly you can build things like this today with a bit of know-how.
1544580	1548580	So it's been me and one other person who have built a number of these prototypes.
1548580	1561580	In this case, what we wanted to do is say, can we create a long lived profile that represents the client that can assist the EA in all sorts of ways?
1561580	1563580	So it's essentially a plugin.
1563580	1568580	But with plugins, you have some limitations, whatever we're experimenting with this on our own.
1568580	1575580	One of the big things we wanted to enable is adding information to the client profile, updating information that's already in there.
1575580	1587580	So the hope is that this could be a hub where over time client preferences and history and even background context documents all can gradually find their way in there.
1587580	1592580	And you have this holistic view where the assistant can go query anything they need.
1592580	1596580	But again, also update add to it's in theory supposed to evolve over time.
1596580	1597580	Right.
1597580	1598580	So we have this chat GPT like interface.
1598580	1606580	And one of the things that we've noticed is that we still see, despite our attempts at education, like it's not perfect.
1606580	1614580	We still see that assistants sometimes need coaching on how to effectively prompt a language model.
1614580	1617580	So that was my motivation coming into this little thing.
1617580	1623580	I already had this react app, which is again, just the chat GPT like little app.
1623580	1628580	And I wanted to add a module to it.
1628580	1631580	The module I wanted to add was a prompt coach.
1631580	1646580	So I wanted to take a put in another little layer or would look at what the assistant, the human assistant put into the chat app and send that through its own prompt to say, are you applying all the best practices?
1646580	1649580	Are you telling the AI like what role you wanted to play?
1649580	1651580	What job you wanted to do?
1651580	1656580	Are you specifying a format that you want your response back in?
1656580	1668580	Are you are you often these days will do it by default, but are you setting it up in such a way where it will do some sort of chain of thought, think out loud, think step by step reasoning before giving a final answer?
1668580	1680580	That's actually one of the the most common things I see people do to shoot themselves in the foot with AI performance is prompt in such a way where it prevents the what is now the kind of trained in default behavior.
1680580	1685580	Explain, analyze, think about it a little bit before getting to a final answer.
1685580	1687580	So you just have a number of best practices.
1687580	1689580	Let me stop you there real quick.
1689580	1695580	What are people doing that would prevent the model from doing the kind of chain of thought best practice that that makes it reason the best.
1695580	1706580	Anything that just sets it up in such a way where it's got to answer immediately with no ability to scratch its way through the problem is bad.
1706580	1710580	And I see that very often it's common.
1710580	1714580	It happens even in like academic publications, not infrequently.
1714580	1715580	Yeah.
1715580	1719580	Often that's a hangover from the earlier era of multi shot prompting.
1719580	1721580	And obviously this is all changing super quick, right?
1721580	1730580	But if you go back, the first instruction model that hit the public was open AI's text of inchy 002 in January of 2022.
1730580	1740580	So we're almost on two years, but still not even two years since you could first just tell the AI write me a haiku and it would attempt to write you a haiku.
1740580	1743580	At that point, it was not necessarily going to get the syllables right.
1743580	1751580	The earlier generations were, you would have to say a haiku by author name colon and then hope that it would continue the pattern.
1751580	1753580	That's the classic prompting.
1753580	1756580	And with instructions, now you can tell it what you want to do.
1756580	1759580	And obviously that's gotten better and better.
1759580	1772580	But in the benchmarking in an academic context that was developed before this instruction change, typically you would have like question, answer, question, answer, question, answer, question.
1772580	1774580	And the AI's job would be to give you the answer.
1774580	1778580	And so they would be measured off it on five shot prompts or what have you.
1778580	1784580	But a lot of that stuff was all that scaffolding was built before people had even figured out chain of thought.
1784580	1800580	And so now if you take that exact structure and you bring it to a GPT-4, you're often much better off just giving it the single question with no structure, letting it spell out its reasoning because again, now it will do that by default and then give you an answer.
1800580	1810580	Versus if you set up question, answer, question, answer, question, answer, it will respect to the implicit structure that you are establishing and it will jump straight to an answer.
1810580	1813580	Often these are like multiple choice or they could be a number or what have you.
1813580	1819580	It will jump to an answer, but the quality of the answer is much reduced compared to default behavior.
1819580	1822580	If you just let it think it think itself through it.
1822580	1824580	And I've even seen this in Bard.
1824580	1833580	I think this is hopefully now fixed, but not too long ago, Bard would give you an answer before explanation by default.
1833580	1838580	And again, that's just like you're going to have a problem so that sometimes people do that by mistake.
1838580	1841580	They'll say give an answer and then explain your reasoning.
1841580	1843580	You're just hurting yourself, right?
1843580	1848580	Because it will explain its reasoning for a wrong answer once the wrong answer is established.
1848580	1852580	So AAA is my in the EA education.
1852580	1857580	It's AAA for AAA results analysis before answer always.
1857580	1859580	I never heard that before. I like that.
1859580	1862580	It's hopefully hopefully they'll remember it coming out.
1862580	1863580	No, I like it.
1863580	1866580	Hey, we'll continue our interview in a moment after a word from our sponsors.
1866580	1873580	If you're a startup founder or executive running a growing business, you know that as you scale your systems break down and the cracks start to show.
1873580	1876580	If this resonates with you, there are three numbers you need to know.
1876580	1879580	36,000, 25, and 1.
1879580	1880580	36,000.
1880580	1883580	That's the number of businesses which have upgraded to NetSuite by Oracle.
1883580	1889580	NetSuite is the number one cloud financial system, streamlined accounting, financial management, inventory, HR, and more.
1889580	1890580	25.
1890580	1892580	NetSuite turns 25 this year.
1892580	1898580	That's 25 years of helping businesses do more with less, close their books in days, not weeks, and drive down costs.
1898580	1905580	One, because your business is one of a kind, so you get a customized solution for all your KPIs in one efficient system with one source of truth.

1927580	1937580	Omnike uses generative AI to enable you to launch hundreds of thousands of ad iterations that actually work, customized across all platforms with a click of a button.
1937580	1942580	I believe in Omnike so much that I invested in it, and I recommend you use it too.
1942580	1945580	Use Kogrev to get a 10% discount.
1945580	1965580	And just to summarize, I think basically what you're saying is a previous generation of prompting really encouraged in your prompt to give multiple examples of the kind of question and answer kind of thing that you wanted the model to do and then set up the last example such that the next thing the model would do is give you a direct response.
1965580	1982580	But what we found over time is one other really effective thing to do is rather than have the model give a direct response or direct answer to a question or a problem posed to it is letting the model quote unquote think out loud first by reasoning through the problem just like a human would do a word problem.
1982580	1993580	And then at the end of its response given answer improves the quality of the answer that you're giving and improves the quality of the result that you get from the model.
1993580	2001580	And what has happened is OpenAI and other model providers have made that more of the default behavior so that you'll pretty much always do that.
2001580	2011580	But using previous prompting techniques, a few shot prompting or multi shot prompting where you're giving examples might lead it to just answer directly and you should look out for that and try to avoid that.
2011580	2023580	Great summary. Yes. If it is jumping directly to an answer, you are for sure leaving performance on the table for all but maybe the most trivial tasks.
2023580	2027580	Yeah. And just an aside, see how much creative work is just summarizing.
2027580	2032580	Important because I tend to give you the long version by default. That's my default behavior.
2032580	2037580	This is one of those micro tasks that I'll just be handing off to an AI avatar version of me at some point.
2037580	2043580	Okay, so let's get back to this. You're working on an app and you want to add a module to it that explains some prompting techniques.
2043580	2051580	And it looks like the app itself is something that you didn't build from scratch and you're trying to get the lay of the land so you know what to do.
2051580	2065580	Exactly. Yeah. And the problem is, I know how to code generally, and I've even coded in JavaScript quite a bit, but React is a JavaScript framework that has a sort of hierarchy of best practices
2065580	2070580	that if you know them and you can easily apply them, then you can work quickly with the framework. That's the value of all these frameworks.
2070580	2078580	But if you don't know them and you're coming in cold like I was, then where do I even go to where there's all these different folders and file structure
2078580	2084580	and where exactly am I supposed to look for the kind of thing that I want to do and where do I put my new module.
2084580	2089580	And so that's where this chat really starts. I have a working app. I have the code for the app.
2089580	2095580	But I've never worked with a React app personally hands on before.
2095580	2107580	So I literally just set up the scenario. And I don't really use too much in the way of like custom instructions or like super elaborate prompts.
2107580	2118580	In my co-pilot mode work, certainly in delegation mode, then you get into a lot more detailed prompts with if this, then that, cases, structured formats, etc, etc.
2118580	2123580	But I often just find a pretty naive approach is effective for things like this.
2123580	2128580	And so I just start off by telling it, I'm working on this React app project and I am a bit lost.
2128580	2137580	Can you explain the structure of the app? I give it a little bit more information and it starts giving me a tutorial of what it is that I'm looking at.
2137580	2145580	And then you've got React and you've got Redux and then you've got these kind of additional slice JS toolkits and sagas and these frameworks
2145580	2156580	and in some cases take on a life of their own where there's whole conferences, right, and companies and it's like you can be very deep down this rabbit hole and whoever like built this open source project that I'm trying to modify.
2156580	2162580	They're using a bunch of different things that are not even necessarily standard but are common or whatever.
2162580	2165580	So just like five different things here that I have no idea about.
2165580	2174580	And without this kind of tutorial, I'd be like going off to search for, okay, what is this saga JS? What does that even do?
2174580	2178580	It's able to give me that entire rundown extremely quickly.
2178580	2187580	And then this I thought was a really interesting moment because I get a lot of value from things like this where I feel like it's prompting me and it wasn't exactly that here.
2187580	2190580	But it gives me this general structure.
2190580	2191580	Yeah.
2191580	2194580	And then I was like, oh, I find it as a general pattern.
2194580	2202580	If you can give it something in a format that it natively showed you, that's probably going to work pretty well.
2202580	2208580	So sometimes even in kind of the delegation mode, sometimes I'll be like, I don't exactly know what structure this should have.
2208580	2213580	But maybe if I have it suggest the structure, then we'll get a structure that it can naturally work well with.
2213580	2222580	In this case, the structure is like dictated by the world, but it's pretty well known that, okay, this is going to be your structure of a project in this react framework.
2222580	2223580	Cool.
2223580	2227580	But this got me thinking, I should give it my actual structure.
2227580	2232580	Like I want to print this thing out for this project that I'm working on because I didn't make it.
2232580	2233580	I don't know what it is.
2233580	2236580	And I want to have it help me interpret that full thing.
2236580	2240580	But then again, I'm like, how do I print something like this?
2240580	2241580	I don't even know how to do that.
2241580	2248580	So my next question for it is, can you write me the command to print out the file structure?
2248580	2251580	And this is where you're like, okay, this is magic, right?
2251580	2254580	Because now again, I don't know how to do this, this tree command.
2254580	2256580	I don't know if it was installed for me or not.
2256580	2258580	But okay, it shows me how to do it.
2258580	2264580	And next thing, oh, there's another step here of installing some package that needed to be installed.
2264580	2265580	Okay, it was helping with that.
2265580	2267580	So I'm just encountering all these.
2267580	2269580	This is the classic developer experience.
2269580	2272580	Conceptually, I have a clear idea of what I want to do.
2272580	2280580	But now I'm like three levels, three nested problems down here where I'm like, oh, okay, I need to understand this framework.
2280580	2281580	Right.
2281580	2282580	Oh, okay.
2282580	2287580	I need to print out the structure to better understand the version I'm working with in this framework.
2287580	2290580	Oh, now I need to install something so I can do that print.
2290580	2292580	And this is where people just time goes to die, right?
2292580	2296580	It's like, yeah, you talk to programmers and you're like, yeah, you didn't get anything done today on there.
2296580	2301580	But what happened was I was on the way to the market to get my app together.
2301580	2304580	And then I had to install this thing and then I couldn't install.
2304580	2307580	But each of these things, like it's helping me get over.
2307580	2310580	And now finally I'm able to say, okay, here is my app.
2310580	2313580	This is the app that I actually am working with.
2313580	2319580	And now we're really getting into something good because it can now break that down.
2319580	2323580	And the names of the things are like pretty semantic.
2323580	2325580	I noticed I haven't even given it any code here.
2325580	2331580	I've just given it the file names, but the file names have a kind of an indication of what is what.
2331580	2335580	And it gets a sense just from that of what the app actually is.
2335580	2340580	So let's go over to, I think I just got a link to a working version of the app.
2340580	2341580	It's pretty simple.
2341580	2343580	It's a chat GPT like environment.
2343580	2345580	We can create these client profiles.
2345580	2346580	We have our chats.
2346580	2348580	We have our history, a couple of different models.
2348580	2354580	And there's function calling in the background that connects the chat experience to the client profile.
2354580	2360580	And what I'm trying to add is a module in the lower right hand corner, which I'm actually not sure if this version has.
2360580	2367580	But the point of it is to take my prompts, run them through this meta prompt as we discussed, and then show feedback warnings.
2367580	2370580	Okay, you may or may not be doing this quite right.
2370580	2371580	So back to the thing.
2371580	2372580	I've given the file structure.
2372580	2375580	It's now able to understand the file structure.
2375580	2378580	And now I'm saying, okay, here's what I'm trying to do.
2378580	2380580	I'm trying to create this prompt coach.
2380580	2382580	I forget exactly how I had approached this.
2382580	2386580	Yeah, this is a different file.
2386580	2387580	We see exactly what I'm doing here.
2387580	2391580	Seems like maybe you had some sample code or something you've written or.
2391580	2392580	Yeah, I did.
2392580	2395580	I guess I took one stab at it myself and it didn't work.
2395580	2398580	I see where I'm looking at the human version.
2398580	2401580	I was looking at the same file structure and I'm like, okay, I see that there's this module.
2401580	2403580	There's like a sidebar here.
2403580	2405580	And as you see these names, right?
2405580	2412580	So you've got sidebar and search and there's going to be like chat history here somewhere chat.
2412580	2416580	I'm looking at this and I'm like, okay, I see all these different elements and I see all these things.
2416580	2420580	Let me just try to copy one and mess with it a little bit and hopefully get somewhere.
2420580	2421580	Right.
2421580	2422580	And then I'm not getting anywhere.
2422580	2424580	It's not showing up where I want to show up.
2424580	2425580	I'm not seeing it.
2425580	2428580	And so that's where I come to say, okay, now here's what I tried.
2428580	2429580	Why isn't it working?
2429580	2430580	Yeah.
2430580	2431580	And I explain my problem here at the end.
2431580	2435580	The problem I have is that it's being shown in the wrong place.
2435580	2436580	Right.
2436580	2437580	So then it explains the answer.
2437580	2438580	Yeah.
2438580	2444580	Next thing we're motto, it's giving me instructions with code, modify this, put it over here.
2444580	2445580	This is pretty cool too.
2445580	2447580	Unfortunately, we can't share the old screenshots.
2447580	2454580	I don't know exactly what I used, but this is right as vision was being introduced to chat GPT as well.
2454580	2458580	So I was able to then say, here's my screenshot.
2458580	2461580	Here's where it is showing up and here's where I want it to show up.
2461580	2462580	Right.
2462580	2464580	And can you help me with that as well?
2464580	2470580	So from the screenshots, from the HTML structure, basically we just work through this entire thing.
2470580	2477580	I continue to run into issues where only 25% of the way through this whole thing.
2477580	2478580	Oh, wow.
2478580	2483580	This probably took me, I don't know, two to three hours total to get these suggestions,
2483580	2485580	implement them, see what's going wrong.
2485580	2486580	Yada, yada, yada.
2486580	2488580	It writes all the code basically.
2488580	2489580	Right.
2489580	2492580	Because again, I've never written a line of React code in my life.
2492580	2497580	So I don't know any of this syntax, there's a million ways to get it not quite right when
2497580	2499580	you have no idea what you're doing anyway.
2499580	2504580	And so it's writing all the code and just bit by bit where we're finding the experience,
2504580	2507580	we're finding the interface, here we're creating some CSS.
2507580	2511580	We're using, we have a particular style pack that's already built into this.
2511580	2514580	So again, that's just another thing I'm not at all familiar with.
2514580	2519580	You know, this is the syntax for figuring out how to use that style pack.
2519580	2521580	Good luck making that up on your own.
2521580	2526580	And then we go basically after a couple of hours, I got to a working module where the
2526580	2533580	prompt coach, you know, would intercept your call, do the meta prompt, parse the response,
2533580	2538580	identify, I had it giving the suggestions and the urgency of the suggestions.
2538580	2541580	So we're color coding those suggestions as they come up.
2541580	2543580	If it's serious, then you get it in red.
2543580	2546580	And if it's not, you can get it in yellow or just a notice.
2546580	2550580	And I would have, I would guess that this would have taken me easily order of magnitude
2550580	2554580	longer in a pre chat GPT here.
2554580	2560580	If this was two to three hours, it's probably two to three days of work to figure out all this stuff.
2560580	2566580	And I know a lot more frustration that is because I'm not a super patient person.
2566580	2571580	The feeling of a million people have done something almost exactly like this.
2571580	2574580	There's nothing differentiated or special about what I'm doing.
2574580	2580580	I'm just like in this phase of kind of not knowing what I'm doing and just getting constantly stuck,
2580580	2583580	constantly stumbling, constantly running into friction.
2583580	2584580	I really don't enjoy that.
2584580	2586580	I think most people don't.
2586580	2589580	This is none of that or almost none of it, right?
2589580	2591580	Even just that going back to the install, right?
2591580	2593580	Or the command to print out the structure.
2593580	2594580	Man, this is so stupid.
2594580	2596580	I know exactly what I want.
2596580	2598580	I know that it is doable.
2598580	2601580	I know that it's been done a million times, a million places.
2601580	2602580	And yet I don't know how to do it.
2602580	2609580	And then liberating me from that frustration is, it turns out, it would go to your drudgery point, right?
2609580	2615580	That was probably 80 to 90% of the time in a world where I was doing this on my own.
2615580	2620580	And now we're down to the two to three hours where it was really about defining what I want.
2620580	2623580	This could have been one hour if I really knew React,
2623580	2628580	but it taught me the ropes and did the task in probably again,
2628580	2633580	80 to 90% time savings compared to the unassisted version.
2633580	2634580	I love this.
2634580	2636580	I think this is such a cool example.
2636580	2638580	I really appreciate you bringing this.
2638580	2643580	One, yeah, it's obvious that this kind of thing, which if you're not a programmer,
2643580	2647580	like as a programmer looking at this, I'm like, yeah, this is so much of what you do as a programmer,
2647580	2651580	especially if you're a programmer like working on startup stuff is like this kind of thing.
2651580	2652580	It's like, this is doable.
2652580	2653580	It's been achieved before.
2653580	2656580	I just need to do it in this, in my specific context.
2656580	2662580	And it's obvious that this would have taken you days or taken really anyone days to do from scratch,
2662580	2667580	but with chat GBT, it makes it like the way quicker and takes away a lot of the drudgery.
2667580	2671580	But I think what's really cool and really beautiful, which is like weird to say about this stuff.
2671580	2680580	It's striking me right now is there's this dance happening in this chat where at the beginning,
2680580	2683580	obviously you're asking it for to help you.
2683580	2690580	But you are giving it what it needs and filling in the gaps that it needs in order to like help you
2690580	2692580	and it is filling in the gaps for you as well.
2692580	2696580	So it is explaining react to you, but you are explaining.
2696580	2700580	Here is the project that I have and here are the specific details that I want done.
2700580	2707580	And then there's this like dance back and forth where you're mutually filling in gaps that both of you can't on your own fill in.
2707580	2715580	And I think that is like really cool to just watch that evolve where at the start you don't know react
2715580	2719580	and you don't know like where to where to put your code and you don't know why it's not working.
2719580	2725580	And at the start, it doesn't know who you are or what you're trying to accomplish or what the specifics of your project is.
2725580	2730580	But as you build up this chat, you yourself are starting to understand things more.
2730580	2732580	Like you didn't ask it, just go do this for me.
2732580	2735580	You asked how does a react project work and like what is the structure.
2735580	2739580	And so you learned more about react and it learned more about you.
2739580	2744580	And as your mutual understanding increased, you were both able to accomplish the thing together.
2744580	2746580	And I think that's really cool.
2746580	2748580	Yeah, it's awesome.
2748580	2751580	The next generation, it's episodic.
2751580	2754580	We were still only halfway through this scroll for all the scrolling I've done.
2754580	2756580	I just highlighted this. Okay, cool.
2756580	2760580	This is working because at this point I'm starting to get into like refinements.
2760580	2766580	Okay, now I want to dial in the styling and basically at this point, the core problems have been solved.
2766580	2772580	And now again, it's just going to do the drudgery of making sure that there's padding and things are centered and so on and so forth.
2772580	2777580	I try to be polite and encouraging to my AIs wherever I possibly can.
2777580	2779580	But you can envision a future.
2779580	2788580	And I think that future is already starting to become visible through the through the mist a little bit as more and more stuff gets published on the research side.
2788580	2795580	Where this sort of episodic relationship where I started a new chat, it now knows nothing about this, right?
2795580	2797580	I can continue this chat up to a limit.
2797580	2804580	And obviously, superhuman expansive background knowledge, but zero contextual knowledge.
2804580	2808580	And we can't retain that from one episode to the next.
2808580	2811580	But I do think that is also coming soon too.
2811580	2814580	And there's a couple different ways it could shape up.
2814580	2821580	But I think we will, in a year, certainly not that much longer than that, I can't imagine.
2821580	2829580	Start to see things where all this history is accumulated or maybe divided into different threads or whatever.
2829580	2837580	But where this kind of can follow you forward into different tasks as well in a history aware way, I think will be another level of unlock.
2837580	2838580	I think you're totally right.
2838580	2840580	That's what custom instructions is.
2840580	2841580	It's a step in that direction.
2841580	2844580	Unfortunately, custom instructions is very hard to set up.
2844580	2846580	But if you do set it up, it's really great.
2846580	2848580	It's really nice for it to have context on you.
2848580	2849580	But I do think you're right.
2849580	2855580	ChatGPT will definitely have a memory that it can reference this stuff and reference the context of what you need and who you are.
2855580	2864580	And that will make it, even with the same level of intelligence as the model, will make it like 10x more useful and 10x faster to get to the right answer.
2864580	2868580	How much do you put into custom instructions?
2868580	2874580	Because for something like this, it might be my profile, my writing sample, maybe whatever.
2874580	2880580	But I probably wouldn't have, by the way, Nathan's a React novice and doesn't know how to install anything.
2880580	2887580	Do you have a vision or a sort of recommendation for a custom instruction that would help me with things like this?
2887580	2888580	You're asking the right person.
2888580	2892580	I have a very extensive custom instruction and a lot of opinions about it.
2892580	2893580	If you want, I can share them.
2893580	2895580	I can share it with you right now and we can talk about it.
2895580	2896580	Sure.
2896580	2897580	Yeah, let's check it out.
2897580	2898580	Okay.
2898580	2902580	The first part of custom instructions is, what do you want ChatGPT to know about you?
2902580	2914580	And I actually like really having it know a little bit about who I am because there's enough about me on the internet that it knows my name and that actually helps.
2914580	2917580	Same thing with every, there's enough about every internet that it knows my name.
2917580	2923580	And every once in a while, not having to explain who I am or what the company is that I run is like really useful.
2923580	2930580	For example, I was thinking a couple of weeks ago about starting a course and I was working with ChatGPT to decide how to do the course and whatever.
2930580	2932580	And the first problem was I want to do a course.
2932580	2933580	Can you help me think about it?
2933580	2937580	And with custom instructions on it knows that I'm a writer and entrepreneur and so cool.
2937580	2938580	I'll help you build a course.
2938580	2941580	Here's how to think about it because it knows that I'm probably going to build one.
2941580	2945580	But if I turn custom instructions off, it will be like, cool, what course do you want to take?
2945580	2949580	And it's those like little things that like really make a difference for me.
2949580	2958580	But basically like who serious relationships in my life are I have in here, like my sister, her husband, her son, I have my girlfriend up there.
2958580	2969580	Who people are at every because referencing their names is just much easier for me to be like, okay, when I'm talking about something and not have to explain who she is every single time is really helpful.
2969580	2975580	I think another really interesting thing is adding into custom instructions.
2975580	2979580	What are the things about you that you know that you're trying to like work on?
2979580	2984580	For example, I feel like I'm I have a fear of rejecting people which causes me to be too agreeable.
2984580	2994580	I'm a little bit too opportunistic and I would like to be more strategic like stuff like that is really helpful to put in custom instructions because it's these little realizations that you have every day.
2994580	2998580	You're like, wow, yeah, I am a little too opportunistic.
2998580	3004580	I think Chatchity is great for being the thing that can help you as you're in the moment day to day.
3004580	3009580	Remember to pull back and incorporate some of these insights that you have that everyone has about themselves.
3009580	3019580	And same thing for goals like having know what your goals are and bring you back to those things all the time as you're using is really helpful.
3019580	3020580	Cool.
3020580	3021580	Well, thanks for sharing.
3021580	3028580	I think I use it a lot more for just like very unfamiliar topics.
3028580	3033580	I'm very just looking at these examples right that we had queued up.
3033580	3042580	Okay, there's an app in a framework that I've never touched and know nothing about working on a patent application and creating diagrams for a patent application.
3042580	3044580	I don't really know how to do that at all.
3044580	3046580	Is there again, I'm starting with these very basic questions.
3046580	3050580	What's a good syntax that I might use to create a diagram for a patent application?
3050580	3052580	I just come in so cold.
3052580	3065580	But it does suggest that you are doing a lot more kind of thought partner like brainstorming about your kind of core stuff, which is interesting.
3065580	3075580	I'm much more on these kind of episodic things that we're like my history and this doesn't overlap almost at all in a lot of cases.
3075580	3082580	But it just goes to show how many different ways of using these tools there are too.
3082580	3088580	And yeah, this could be another new year's resolution to try to bring it a little bit closer to the core of what I do.
3088580	3091580	It's not to say that it's not at the core of what I do, but not in this co-pilot way.
3091580	3096580	With things like Waymark, I'm working very closely with language models to make an app work well.
3096580	3102580	And I feel like I have intimate knowledge of the details of how it works in that respect.
3102580	3111580	It's a big project for me, but again, a different mode than the interactive dance kind of mode that you describe.
3111580	3112580	Fascinating.
3112580	3114580	Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
3114580	3120580	I definitely use it for some of this knowledge exploration stuff too, but yeah, it's totally a sort of thought partner for me.
3120580	3124580	But I'd love to keep looking through some of the other chats you brought.
3124580	3125580	Cool.
3125580	3128580	Next one on working on diagrams.
3128580	3136580	We're going to have a combination of a provisional patent application and the supporting diagrams for the patent application.
3136580	3139580	This is something that I was doing for Waymark.
3139580	3146580	And we have this ensemble method of creating advertising video for small business.
3146580	3150580	Basically, folks come into the site.
3150580	3153580	They get to enter a website URL.
3153580	3156580	Typically, people will give like the homepage of their small business website.
3156580	3160580	We have some code that goes and like grabs content off of that website.
3160580	3166580	And then we build a profile on a synthetically if you're custom instructions, so to speak, within the context of our app.
3166580	3167580	Who are you as a user?
3167580	3168580	What's your business?
3168580	3169580	What are you all about?
3169580	3170580	What kind of business?
3170580	3171580	What images?
3171580	3175580	And then to actually create the video, you give a very specific, although it's like a super short instruction.
3175580	3182580	I want to make a video for my sale this Saturday where I'm opening a new location and here's the address or whatever.
3182580	3185580	This is my purpose in this moment prompt.
3185580	3193580	And then we've got a pretty complicated machinery that takes all those inputs and it works with a language model to write a script.
3193580	3201580	And then it has computer vision components that decide which of the images from your library should be used to complement the script and all these different points along the way.
3201580	3204580	And that is, it's a pretty cool experience.
3204580	3211580	Now, really compared to, again, you think about pre AI and now what we had before was an easy to use template library.
3211580	3214580	And what we have now is really the AI makes you content.
3214580	3222580	Like it's a phase change in terms of how easy it is to use, how quick the experience is, how much you can just rifle through ideas.
3222580	3227580	If you don't like the first thing, you just ask it to do another and it's qualitatively just way more fun.
3227580	3231580	People used to have to sit there and type stuff in and they were like, okay, what do I say?
3231580	3232580	And I'm not sure what to say.
3232580	3239580	And a lot of people are not content creators, but everybody always referred to the Mr. Burns episode from the Simpsons.
3239580	3246580	This is a long time ago, but he goes to an art museum for a reveal of some piece of art and they reveal it.
3246580	3249580	And he says, I'm no art critic, but I know what I hate.
3249580	3253580	And that's, I feel like, exactly how our users operate.
3253580	3255580	They ask for something.
3255580	3256580	They wait 30 seconds.
3256580	3259580	They now get to watch a video featuring their business.
3259580	3261580	And if they like it, they can proceed.
3261580	3266580	And if they don't like it, it's very obvious to them and they can very quickly be like, no, not that.
3266580	3267580	Give me another one.
3267580	3269580	And here's an alternate instruction.
3269580	3271580	So anyway, this is the app that we built.
3271580	3275580	And now we're like, okay, maybe we should think about filing a provisional patent on that.
3275580	3281580	Like most software companies, we're never going to prosecute our patents, but we just want to make sure nobody can come in and give us a hard time.
3281580	3283580	So how do I write a patent?
3283580	3286580	And how do I create the diagrams?
3286580	3288580	And I want to be able to update it.
3288580	3291580	I want to have something that's not like just a total mess.
3291580	3297580	So this was a series of different interactions that ultimately led me to these diagrams.
3297580	3305580	But I provided initially basically what I just said to you, which is a rambling sort of instruction on here is my app.
3305580	3306580	And here's what it does.
3306580	3307580	Here's how it works.
3307580	3308580	Here's some of the parts behind it.
3308580	3312580	The language model writes the script and the code that's scripted from the website.
3312580	3320580	And then the other part with the computer vision that figures out what I just literally tell the whole thing and say, now can you use some syntax?
3320580	3327580	To make me a diagram that shows the structure of that app that I just word vomited to you.
3327580	3329580	And so there's like a bunch of different structures out there.
3329580	3331580	So that's the first part of that conversation as well.
3331580	3337580	You could use the mermaid syntax or you could use graph viz or you could use a couple other things.
3337580	3341580	But what are the pros and cons of those and can they represent certain different kinds of structures?
3341580	3346580	We dialed it in on either mermaid or graph is it started to make me a thing.
3346580	3347580	And then you can see here too.
3347580	3353580	This is interesting because I did find in this one that at some point it got confused.
3353580	3360580	I'd given it this thing and had generated this syntax, asked for refinements on the syntax because I'm taking the syntax by the way, going over to another app.
3360580	3365580	What's cool about the syntax is you drop in this pure text syntax and it will render the app for you.
3365580	3370580	So you've got things like this graph is diagram.
3370580	3371580	What's a digraph?
3371580	3372580	I don't even really know.
3372580	3380580	It's called this digraph is G and it has these elements and they have these properties and they're connected in this sort of graph structure, blah, blah, blah.
3380580	3383580	You load it in half a second, you know, it renders it.
3383580	3385580	You're like, oh, no, that's not quite right.
3385580	3387580	This point should be connected to this point.
3387580	3390580	And it's it's skipping one that it's so whatever.
3390580	3392580	So you give it these kind of iterations.
3392580	3396580	It would make progress, but then it would also get confused.
3396580	3400580	It seemed after a number of rounds because there's just maybe like too much syntax.
3400580	3411580	So at some point, I did say, OK, using the episodic memory to my advantage or working around its working memory weaknesses by just wiping and starting over.
3411580	3413580	I'm like, OK, here's the best one from that chat.
3413580	3416580	It was closest to what I wanted it to represent.
3416580	3417580	We just go have another chat.
3417580	3422580	And this time we're going to skip all the part about which format do we use and skip all the word salad.
3422580	3424580	And I can just be like, here's a diagram.
3424580	3426580	I want to make some changes to it.
3426580	3430580	And now have it do more localized edits for me.
3430580	3434580	And again, a lot of little details, a lot of nuance here, but it's happy to do that.
3434580	3437580	We work through a number of rounds of it.
3437580	3444580	And I believe I attached the thing for you what I ended up with after or a couple chats.
3444580	3448580	You even get to the point where you're like color coding and really starting to make sense of it.
3448580	3449580	It's like, right.
3449580	3453580	The green in this diagram now is the things that the user does.
3453580	3456580	So the user tells us what their business website is.
3456580	3457580	Then there's code to go scrape.
3457580	3462580	Then there's this fork where we have to grab all the images and process them in various ways.
3462580	3468580	One of the big challenges is which parts of this can happen in parallel and which parts depend on which parts.
3468580	3473580	This is actually something that we didn't have until I did this, even for the technology team.
3473580	3479580	And I'm not sure how well all the members of the technology team could have even drawn this.
3479580	3486580	So now we actually have a better reference internally also to be like, hey, if we like, what depends on the image aesthetic step?
3486580	3488580	Now we can go look at it and be like, oh, okay.
3488580	3492580	Yeah, you can't select best images until you have the aesthetic scores.
3492580	3493580	Yeah.
3493580	3494580	Good.
3494580	3495580	Completed.
3495580	3497580	Just having that clarity is also I think just operationally useful.
3497580	3508580	But this is the sort of thing that you can attach to a provisional patent application and at least begin to protect yourself from future patent rolls coming your way.
3508580	3509580	Again, how long would this take?
3509580	3518580	If I had drawn it freehand, I maybe could have drawn it in a somewhat comparable time to the amount of time that I spent exchange,
3518580	3527580	but having the syntax and now having it in that kind of structured language way also makes this like much more maintainable,
3527580	3531580	can fit in other things, even can be like more readily used in language models.
3531580	3533580	The vision understanding is getting very good.
3533580	3541580	But I would say it's probably still better at understanding the syntax of the graph more than this visual rendering of the graph.
3541580	3542580	I think that's great.
3542580	3544580	Obviously, ChatGPT has the Dolly integration.
3544580	3550580	So I'm familiar with that, but I've been thinking a lot about sometimes I want to create something that looks like this,
3550580	3552580	like in a graph with text and boxes and all that kind of stuff.
3552580	3557580	And I didn't even think to do to have it just write graph is markup or something like that and paste it somewhere else.
3557580	3561580	So I think that's a really cool thing to know it can do.
3561580	3566580	And it's also pretty clear, I don't know, in a year, it'll probably just render the graph is stuff for you.
3566580	3574580	And you'll be able to like move it around and do all that kind of stuff without even necessarily having to chat back and forth after the first round or something like that.
3574580	3579580	I think that would be a very cool next step for ChatGPT is jump into an edit mode for something like this.
3579580	3585580	Closest thing I've seen to that so far is diagram GPT.
3585580	3587580	This is a slightly different notation.
3587580	3591580	But basically you can prompt in natural language.
3591580	3596580	Yeah, it will then generate, in this case, mermaid syntax for you in response.
3596580	3602580	And then it'll immediately render your image and you can then edit the syntax.
3602580	3606580	You can't quite like drag and drop within the interface itself.
3606580	3616580	But I think this is a really interesting question around highlights and really interesting question around like what things should be in chat GPT versus what things should have their own distinct experience,
3616580	3620580	even if there's still like a very AI assistant component to it.
3620580	3624580	This is one actually that I would expect lives outside of chat GPT.
3624580	3625580	And who knows, right?
3625580	3629580	In the fullness of time, maybe you have like dynamic UI is getting generated on the fly.
3629580	3631580	We're starting to see that a little bit already.
3631580	3641580	But I don't think open AI is going to say what we need to do is create like a UI where people can edit these graph things.
3641580	3642580	If possible, you could do that.
3642580	3648580	GPTs don't really give you the ability to create like custom editor experiences yet anyway.
3648580	3652580	So for now, if you want to have something like that, you have to bring it to a different app.
3652580	3655580	But increasingly, these are out there as well, right?
3655580	3657580	They just use chat GPT and just a renderer.
3657580	3666580	So I had the AI doing all the syntax and then the renderer showing me what it actually is and then going back and continuing the dialogue with chat GPT.
3666580	3667580	I think you're right.
3667580	3673580	Like I could see a world where they let developers build their own renderers inside of chat GPT, not for like really serious stuff.
3673580	3681580	I think like dabble in half one time or make a little video or whatever that like having something in the interface so that you can do it in there.
3681580	3683580	Like a rough thing is really helpful.
3683580	3684580	But then yeah, I think you're right.
3684580	3691580	There will have to be other pro tools for people that all they do all day is make graphs that are not inside of chat GPT.
3691580	3692580	So here's another one.
3692580	3704580	This is recent episode in my life where I had to admit defeat after 10 years of swearing that I would not replace my car until the replacement was self driving.
3704580	3705580	Wow.
3705580	3707580	And we're not quite there.
3707580	3710580	So I finally and I've had three kids in the meantime.
3710580	3715580	So I finally had to break down and get a mini man like many parents of young kids.
3715580	3720580	I'm like, what my kids do is they really depreciate stuff pretty quickly.
3720580	3728580	So I was like, I think I'll get a used right mini man because if I get a new one, it's going to be pretty used pretty quick anyway.
3728580	3730580	So let me just look at what is out there.
3730580	3735580	Now, anybody who's ever shop for a used car knows that it's a total jungle, right?
3735580	3737580	And the car dealer websites are terrible.
3737580	3741580	What features they have is a huge question.
3741580	3749580	And what you end up encountering very quickly is these trim levels, which if you're not like a car head, you may not even know what that is.
3749580	3758580	But that is the sort of you've got your make, which is the brand of the car, your Chevrolet or your Toyota or whatever.
3758580	3762580	You've got your model, which is the kind of car.
3762580	3766580	And then the Dodge caravan is the make and model.
3766580	3769580	And then you've got this trim, which is often just like a couple of letters or whatever.
3769580	3774580	It's like the XRT or the SRT or the L limited or whatever.
3774580	3777580	They just have all these like little and these are package levels, right?
3777580	3780580	What features, what upsells have been included?
3780580	3782580	Does it have a sunroof?
3782580	3788580	Does it have a screen in the back that drops down out of the ceiling for the kids or whatever?
3788580	3789580	Right.
3789580	3797580	And it's just a jungle to even try to figure out what those things have, what levels there are and what those things have.
3797580	3801580	So this is perplexity, which is a great compliment to chat GPT.
3801580	3806580	It is more specifically focused on answering questions.
3806580	3811580	So in this way, it's a more direct rival to a Google search.
3811580	3814580	It's not so much meant to be like a brainstorming partner.
3814580	3821580	They really aim for accurate answers to concrete questions, do a phenomenal job on it.
3821580	3825580	So here I had a number of runs of this as well, different kinds of questions or whatever.
3825580	3831580	But okay, these minivans that are like not super old, but old, pretty cheap.
3831580	3832580	What do they have?
3832580	3833580	What do they not have?
3833580	3837580	And this would have taken, I don't even know if I had really tried, I wouldn't have done it.
3837580	3839580	This is one of those things that you just, I wouldn't do.
3839580	3850580	But if you had set out to go collate, okay, here's all the makes and the models and the trims and what they have, you're going to be in like user manuals or something.
3850580	3854580	I don't even know really where that information is stored around truth.
3855580	3864580	But just in asking that question, I was able to get the trim levels for all of the different brands for this window of time.
3864580	3872580	And just easily get a handle now that I could reference back to, okay, this one on this dealer site, it doesn't have any pictures.
3872580	3877580	It doesn't say anything, but it does say, for example, oh, it's an, it's a SXT.
3877580	3878580	Okay, cool.
3878580	3882580	Now I can at least know that is the second of however many trim levels or whatever.
3882580	3886580	So the SE, that's your top one, your SXT, that's your, you can imagine, right?
3886580	3888580	Trying to sort this out on your own.
3888580	3890580	And then you get the AVP slash SE.
3890580	3892580	Well, who comes up with this stuff?
3892580	3893580	It's ridiculous.
3893580	3898580	But it's super useful if you're like, I don't want to drive across Metro Detroit to go look at this minivan.
3898580	3901580	If it doesn't have something that I really cared about.
3901580	3904580	And the things that I were zeroed in on were like fairly basic safety features.
3904580	3907580	I wanted the blind spot detection and the backup camera.
3907580	3915580	So there were other questions too, like when did USB charging get introduced into cars in general?
3915580	3917580	I didn't know the answer to that.
3917580	3922580	I'm old enough to remember when you had to plug the thing into the lighter and I didn't want that.
3922580	3925580	So I don't want a car that's that old where I have to use the lighter outlet anymore.
3925580	3931580	I want a car that's at least into the like USB charger era, but when did the USB charger era begin for cars?
3931580	3933580	That was another one that perplexity was able to answer.
3933580	3935580	And it is so good.
3936580	3939580	I think this is about to be a huge trend.
3939580	3942580	If I had to guess, because I've been a big fan of this app for a while.
3942580	3949580	I had the CEO, Arvind on the Cognitive Edition twice and they just they ship super fast.
3949580	3953580	They win head to head comparisons for answer accuracy.
3953580	3955580	The product itself is super fast.
3955580	3962580	It's got great UI with these sources and others starting to become more multimodal with images as well, which is relatively new.
3962580	3965580	We're just a great experience all the way around.
3965580	3972580	And I see it as like setting a new standard for answers that are like I started.
3972580	3981580	I'm starting to use the term per perplexity to say I'm not sure this is necessarily rock solid ground truth.
3981580	3987580	Like perplexity is not always right, but it's the most accurate AI tool.
3987580	3990580	It's usually right in my experience.
3990580	3997580	You might be able to find something here that is wrong, but everything I ended up fact checking turned out to be true.
3997580	4010580	And so there's this kind of very interesting, good enough for practical purposes standard where I don't necessarily need it to be 100, 100 percent accurate for it to be very useful.
4010580	4012580	And I would make my decisions.
4012580	4019580	Did I trust it enough, for example, to be confident that there was in fact going to be a USB charger in the car that I went to go look at?
4019580	4023580	Yes. And in fact, it was correct about that.
4023580	4032580	And so I have this kind of per perplexity standard of verification in my mind now where I'm like, yeah, it's in many situations.
4032580	4034580	It's like good enough to act on.
4034580	4042580	I wouldn't make life and death decisions without more fact checking, but I don't even need to follow these links in most cases now for something like this.
4042580	4043580	I'll trust it.
4043580	4047580	And it's an emerging like standard in the family as well.
4047580	4051580	My wife asks, do we really have to get a car that's that old? Do they have this? Do they have that?
4051580	4057580	And I was able to ask perplexity and send her like, yep, it should have a backup camera per perplexity.
4057580	4060580	It should have a USB charger.
4060580	4063580	It should have the blind spot detection.
4063580	4067580	And it's an incredible time saver.
4067580	4074580	I think I'm just a worthy alternative to even something like a wire cutter, which has been the standard that my wife has used for a long time.
4074580	4079580	But obviously that's an editorial approach where you can't just ask any question you want to ask here.
4079580	4081580	You can ask any question you want to ask.
4081580	4088580	And I think you do get something oftentimes that is like a worthy rival even to a much more editorial product.
4088580	4090580	No, that makes perfect sense.
4090580	4103580	It reminds me of wire cutter reminds me of there are all those sites that are like Cora, but it's like for this new generation where no one had to think previously to ask this particular question.
4103580	4106580	I can just gather and answer the question for you immediately.
4106580	4109580	And I think that's so it's so powerful.
4109580	4114580	Like it's really starting to click for me when and how I might, I might use it.
4114580	4121580	There are so many questions I have this where I'm like, I basically want to get to the best answer for a fact based question, more or less.
4121580	4122580	And I'm so lazy.
4122580	4130580	I really don't want to do all the research and chat to BT will kind of like, it'll do one search and then sort of crib the first article.
4130580	4132580	And this feels a lot better than that.
4132580	4133580	Yeah, it's really good.
4133580	4137580	It's faster than chat to BT on the browsing side.
4137580	4146580	So you're getting to answer notably faster and marginally more accurate, just more the sort of answer that I want.
4146580	4155580	A lot of times like I've had a couple of instances where I tried the same thing with chat to BT and I was able to get there, but it was like slower on the browse.
4155580	4158580	Didn't give me the full answer the first time.
4158580	4160580	I was like, no, but I need a little more.
4160580	4162580	And then I was able to get over the hump and get there.
4162580	4171580	But this was definitely just a faster, cleaner experience that I do believe is a bit more accurate as well.
4171580	4175580	It goes to show that there are different roles that you want AI to play.
4175580	4178580	And I think there is, it's interesting.
4178580	4180580	There's forces pushing both ways, right?
4180580	4184580	What makes the AIs so compelling is that they're extremely general purpose.
4184580	4192580	And it seems like there is something, there is like a fundamental reality that they get really powerful at scale and to scale.
4192580	4194580	They have to be the general purpose.
4194580	4196580	And that kind of comes as a package.
4196580	4198580	But here the scope has been narrowed.
4198580	4204580	And there are a lot of things that chat to BT does for people that this is not trying to do for people.
4204580	4213580	And in its specialization, it does seem to be achieving higher heights in the domain that it really attempts to be best.
4214580	4218580	So I definitely recommend perplexity a lot.
4218580	4223580	And I'm just old enough to remember when people were first saying that they were Googling it.
4223580	4232580	And this has a similar vibe to me where it's a standard that I think people can comfortably socially transact on and feel like they're pretty solid.
4232580	4233580	I love this.
4233580	4239580	Like you're using it to build stuff or also really using it to fuel your curiosity.
4239580	4244580	And I'm curious, like, you know, before we wrap up, what are you excited about now?
4244580	4246580	What are you thinking about right now?
4246580	4254580	Like what's on your radar that you think people should be paying attention to in chat to BT, maybe specifically, but like broadly in AI over the next couple years.
4254580	4262580	Boy, broadly in AI over the next couple years, I think almost anything's possible.
4263580	4272580	I take the leaders of the field pretty much at their word in terms of being honest reflections of their expectations.
4272580	4276580	And you listen to what Sam Altman thinks might happen over the next couple years.
4276580	4281580	You listen to what Dario Amade from Anthropic thinks might happen over the next couple years.
4281580	4290580	And we are potentially looking at something that is superhuman in very substantial and meaningful ways.
4290580	4296580	I think there's a lot of kind of conflation and talking past one another when people try to analyze this.
4296580	4304580	And I do think it's important to say you can be superhuman in very consequential ways without being like omnipotent or infallible.
4304580	4311580	And I think there's actually quite a lot of space right between like human performance and omnipotence or infallibility.
4311580	4318580	And I kind of expect that AI is going to land there for a lot of different things over the next couple of years.
4318580	4325580	So I think the value of the kinds of things that we will be engaging with it for is only headed up.
4325580	4337580	Just a recent result from Google DeepMind on using their best language models for differential diagnosis was an extremely striking result.
4337580	4340580	This team has been on an absolute terror.
4340580	4350580	It was only maybe like a year ago that they first got a language model to like hit passing level on medical licensing tests, which hey, that's crazy.
4350580	4352580	But you can just kind of say, well, it's a test.
4352580	4353580	It's more structured.
4353580	4356580	The real world is messy and they're only passing.
4356580	4357580	You would want a doctor.
4357580	4358580	It's just merely passing.
4358580	4359580	OK, guess what?
4359580	4360580	We didn't stop there.
4360580	4363580	Next thing you know, it was hitting expert level performance on the test.
4363580	4371580	Next thing you know, it's they've added multi modality and it can now do a pretty good job of reading your x-rays and other tissue slides.
4371580	4373580	And again, is it perfect?
4373580	4378580	No, it would be probably on the lower end of what the actual human radiologist could do.
4378580	4379580	Right.
4379580	4380580	Oh, they're even there.
4380580	4381580	It was like 6040, I think.
4381580	4388580	I think it was like 60% to 40% that the human radiologist was beating the AI radiologist.
4388580	4389580	So it's OK.
4389580	4390580	That's a pretty narrow margin.
4390580	4391580	Obviously, we're not done.
4391580	4401580	The current thing is taking case studies out of medical journals, case studies being like extreme hard to figure out cases, right?
4401580	4407580	When a case gets reported in a medical journal, that's because this case, you know, is thought to be highly instructive, right?
4407580	4408580	It was a confusing situation.
4408580	4412580	It's an unfamiliar combination of symptoms or what have you.
4412580	4415580	So they don't publish just the routine cold, right?
4415580	4416580	In the journals.
4416580	4429580	So they take these case studies out of journals and they had a study of comparing AI's effectiveness at doing the differential diagnosis versus human with access to AI.
4429580	4432580	And AI was the best by like a significant margin.
4432580	4435580	The human alone was last.
4435580	4445580	And so they, in their kind of presentation of this, they're very modest and they take almost like a, in my view, almost like a two-grounded willfully bearing the lead.
4445580	4446580	Almost at times, it seems.
4446580	4454580	And what one of the main conclusions of the paper was we need better interfaces so that doctors can take better advantage of this.
4454580	4458580	But it was like, to me, that's yes, that's one lesson I would take away from this paper.
4458580	4466580	But the other lesson is that the AI is getting it right like twice as often as the human clinician, like 60% to 30%.
4466580	4469580	That's another big lesson, too, that I take away from a lot of these things.
4469580	4472580	We don't often measure human performance.
4472580	4478580	We think because we've lived in a world for a long time, we're like, a human doctor is human.
4478580	4484580	We know that like some are better than others, but we look at that as a standard, that there's a human doctor and their license and they're supposed to be good.
4484580	4486580	But like, how often do they get the right diagnosis on this?
4486580	4490580	It turned out in this particular data set, it was in the ballpark of 30%.
4490580	4492580	So there's a lot of room for improvement.
4492580	4496580	And you could perhaps say, what's the best doctor in the world do that?
4496580	4499580	Best doctor in the world, I'm sure is a lot better.
4499580	4503580	Maybe even better than the 60% that their language model was able to do.
4503580	4505580	But you probably can't access that person.
4505580	4510580	We are apparently headed for a world where you should be able to access that AI doctor.
4510580	4523580	And if it's a 2x better performance on such a challenging task as differential diagnosis that I think we're headed for a world of radical access to expertise,
4523580	4531580	which I think is going to be at unbelievably low prices, which I think is going to be a transformative force in society, right?
4531580	4539580	It's going to be one of the greatest blows ever struck for equality of opportunity, equality of access in many ways.
4539580	4547580	It's also going to change a lot of market dynamics and change what wages can be commanded for different kinds of services.
4547580	4548580	I'm excited about that.
4548580	4554580	I think it probably is going to be fairly disruptive and it probably is going to become more and more political.
4554580	4560580	I think that the upside of that, I think is pretty clear and really extremely compelling.
4560580	4566580	So I hope we do get to actually enjoy the fruits of that future.
4566580	4569580	And then one other thing I'll say is just, I don't think we are it.
4569580	4571580	The transformer is not the end of history.
4571580	4573580	That's a chat GPT is not the end of history.
4573580	4576580	It's kind of no memory AI.
4576580	4583580	Just this last week or two, we've seen a flurry of activity in the state space model architecture.
4583580	4592580	And again, it's been reported the headlines if you're on, if you're on Twitter and seeing this stuff, it's hey, there's a new thing that might even be better than the transformer.
4592580	4594580	It might be a transformer successor.
4594580	4595580	It might be a transformer alternative.
4595580	4597580	It might be a transformer replacement.
4597580	4602580	It has some nice properties that the transformers don't have better long term memory, better scaling, better speed, better throughput.
4602580	4605580	Maybe we just all flip over from one to the other.
4605580	4607580	And if the transformer was the old thing, this is the new thing.
4607580	4620580	But I strongly suspect that what we are going to see is a mixture of these architectures where just like in the brain, we obviously don't have just one single unit of the brain that gets repeated over and over again.
4620580	4624580	We have a lot of different modules, including some that do get repeated.
4624580	4635580	It seems like we're almost for sure headed for AIs that are like composites of different kinds of architectures that bring their own strengths and weaknesses in information processing to the table.
4635580	4648580	Such that as much as this has been a shocking amount of progress to get to GPT-4 from GPT-2 just four years ago, I have to say I think the next few years are going to bring at least as much more change.
4648580	4651580	And it's going to be a wild ride.
4651580	4659580	It's exciting. It's inspiring. I'm excited for the future and I really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts and show us how you use chat GPT.
4659580	4664580	And I'd love to have you back and see where we are, see what new stuff comes up on the horizon.
4664580	4665580	Yeah, thank you.
4665580	4667580	I appreciate the opportunity Dan. This has been a lot of fun.
4667580	4673580	And I definitely learned some things and was inspired to go chase down a few more use cases as well.
4673580	4679580	So hopefully next time I'll have some better custom instructions and a little bit better track record in the brainstorming department.
4679580	4680580	Let me submit a great exchange.
4680580	4682580	That sounds great. Yeah, thanks a lot.
