0	14480	Hello, and welcome, everyone. This is Active Inference, guest stream 77.1. We're here
14480	21640	with Gareth Stubbs, going to be discussing the police hunch. So, Gareth, thank you very
21640	29360	much for joining. Looking forward to your presentation and the discussion we'll have.
29360	33840	Thank you so much for having me, Daniel, and it's an absolute pleasure to be on the stream,
33840	39000	one that I've watched many times, and it's a privilege to be able to talk through the
39000	44200	paper. I'm hoping to give you a little bit of background as to why I wrote the paper,
44200	49600	where I've come from, a little bit of history, talk through the paper itself, and then hopefully
49600	55320	take some interesting questions, if there's anybody watching, or from Daniel himself,
55440	63120	who's always got some very insightful questions to ask. So, if you're all right, Daniel, am I okay to
63120	70520	start and get going? Yeah, okay. So, a little bit of background. So, I'm a relatively new
70520	77240	academic. I was a police officer for 18 years in the UK. I was in a Northern English force,
78360	85000	and during my career, I did a wide range of stuff from like frontline emergency response,
85000	90440	blue lights, to community policing, which is building relationships with the community,
90440	97080	gathering intelligence, and then working on long term problem solving. Through to working in
97080	103160	national strategy, I worked for the College of Policing, and more latterly, the home office,
103160	108760	the inspectorate. And the inspectorate was an organisation where we would inspect police officers
108760	114840	and make sure that the standards of policing and how they recorded and monitored and all that was
114840	122040	up to a particular level. And for the last five years of my policing career, I was studying a
122040	129160	part-time PhD on the side, and you would think, with me having written this paper, it would be a
129160	137800	police decision making or similar, and it wasn't. I actually studied using two theories, which were
137800	142200	representative bureaucracy and social embeddedness, and it was actually about how
142920	149000	new police recruits navigated the police recruitment process via the use of their
149000	156440	social networks. It sounds complicated and convoluted, and it was essentially spent a lot of time
157080	162440	trying to figure out how people gained advantage or disadvantage through their current social networks
162440	171160	whilst trying to get into the police, with the hope of figuring out why our recruitment process
171160	178520	was so discriminatory. And I've been working on publishing from that PhD, I've only just finished
178520	184920	actually, over the last maybe two, three years, whereupon I went out to the Middle East to teach
184920	190280	police officers now. There's two people that I want to discuss during this stream, the first being
191800	196120	two different groups of people, the first one being Professor Friston, who was just amazing
196120	202840	when I contacted him, and the other being two very well known criminologists called Ken Pease
203960	213640	and Jason Roche. And this entire lane or path of study came out of a discussion with them,
213640	219800	because I was talking about very strange decision making that you make while in service.
220440	224280	So you make decisions that other people look at and say, oh, that's a very strange decision,
224280	229080	why did that police officer make that decision? But when you speak to the officer, they're often
229080	235400	able to relate quite a complicated series of past experiences that have led to the decision
235400	241720	that they've made. And it was Ken Pease, who's, again, a very well known criminologist who said
241720	247080	to me, look, you need to read about the Bayesian brain. He said, what you're describing is how
247080	256760	the Bayesian brain works. So he set me on this kind of down the rabbit hole journey, if you like,
256760	262120	and did a lot of reading of the foundational papers around the Bayesian brain, which I found
262120	266840	very complicated because I didn't have a background in mathematics or neuroscience or cognitive
266840	273320	science. So it was kind of like jumping in the deep end. But he recommended a really good
273400	278760	book called Super Forecasters by Tetlock. Some of you may have heard of it, some of you may not
278760	285240	have heard about it, but it's essentially the human art of prediction, like how intuition is made
285880	293800	in the Bayesian brain. And I found the book revelatory because when I look back at my police
293800	298280	experience, I could see the development of my Bayesian brain as time went on and how my decision
298280	303080	making changed. And this was like kind of mixed because we all have our backgrounds and our history.
303080	310120	But when I was at the home office in London, and we were looking at the way that police forces were
311080	315400	organized and governed and all that sort of thing, we could see that there was a general
315400	321720	tendency towards this kind of promotion of the generalist. So a lot of your senior managers
321720	325400	seem to have been able to like bounce around the organization. They've done lots of different
325400	330440	things. Some have been detectives, some have been uniforms, some have been in corporates,
330440	335480	some have been firearms. You had all these different kind of disciplines, if you like.
338040	342600	You ended up with a lot of senior leaders who were jack of all trades and essentially
343880	349160	masters of none. And this was in direct contrast to a lot of the research that looked at teams
349160	353960	of specialists, people with specialist knowledge that have built up very, very solid, what you
353960	358200	could call like Bayesian building blocks when it comes to specialist decision making. And then
358200	362200	when you put them together, the matching of all these specialisms then resulted in higher
362200	366920	performance of external private companies. So we were trying to think about how this might
366920	372840	look in policing. And it was only when I wrote a read super forecasting solid blocks of prediction
372840	380840	that I started to understand how the brain may work. Now, of course, if you at any point go into
380920	384920	YouTube and you type in the Bayesian brain, you're going to get Professor Friston in some way.
386200	392840	So that was my first introduction. And this was probably about two years ago. And I absolutely
392840	401240	devoured all of his podcasts. I mean, everything that I could find. And that kind of linked in a
401240	406360	lot with the LLM development. Obviously, we have the side by side active inference seem to be like
406360	412040	picking up steam like crazy. And then we have the LLMs and the AI research picking up steam.
412040	416120	And then you could see how the two were starting to like twist and merge. And there were some really
416120	424440	good podcasts from Machine Learning Street Talk and Curt Jaimungles podcast theory of everything.
425720	429960	Well, we're talking really long form like two and a half, three hour discussions on this stuff.
430040	438600	And I was just absolutely immersed. And I started to think about how this has never been used in
438600	443560	practice like in policing, you know, like, a lot of the time we go to these training sessions,
443560	447640	you'd have some experienced practitioners talking to you about how they made decisions.
447640	452200	We'd have decision making models and me with my relatively new academic brain was immediately
452200	455880	going straight to Google scholar and saying, okay, what's the empirical basis for these
455880	461000	decision making models? I know everyone's using them. But do we know if they work? Do we know if
461000	466120	they speed up our decision making? Are they better with those who've got better Bayesian
466120	471240	building blocks? Are they not better? So when you start to look at these questions, you realize that
472040	480200	there's almost no research to support police decision making models. And the best stuff
480200	485800	that I found on that is in Andy Clark book, and the experience machine as a full chapter
485800	491880	on looking at police decision making. Anyway, I'm getting slightly distracted. How did I actually
491880	499880	come to the paper? So there was one experience in my service. And I'm going to tell the story
499880	506520	because it's in the paper. If that's all right, Daniel, is that okay? Okay. So I was a
507480	511720	newly promoted sergeant. And that's like a first line supervisor in the police. I had a team of
511720	519480	about 15 police officers. And I was probably about 27, 28 years old. And I was out with one of those
519480	525000	police officers who was new. And he was trying to build his confidence. So I said to him, look,
526200	531320	Jamie, I said, we're going to go to all the bad stuff tonight. So when the nasty incidents come
531320	535160	in, we're going to go and I'm going to see if I can work with you on building your confidence in
535160	539400	these sort of like, you know, these, these high risk situations. And he was all up for it.
540920	547320	And then domestic violence incident came in and the male offender was still inside the
548280	552120	house. And we knew that they've been violent shoes because the person who rang it in was a
552120	558120	neighbor. And the neighbor had said that she was severely injured and bleeding. So because there
558120	563080	was a chance that it could get rough, and we might need to make an arrest straightaway,
563080	568680	I thought this would be good for Jamie to go to. And he was a Taser officer. And I don't know how,
568680	573800	how like, experienced you guys are. So I'll just let you know, but police officers in
573800	578600	England, we don't carry guns like, and there's probably about five or 6% of police officers
578600	584040	that carry guns at the most. And a lot of them are only sent to incidents that may involve firearms.
584040	592120	So the vast majority of incidents we go to, we have a baton, she's like a stick, and a spray.
593080	597560	And they're the, they're the two bits that we've got to deal with it. Now Jamie had just got his
597560	604120	Taser, and he was trying to build his confidence. And so we turned up, there was a very injured
604120	608680	lady on the sidewalk, she was pulling clumps out of her hair, she'd been clearly
609720	615480	punched a great deal of face was an absolute mess. And she told us that he was still inside the
615480	621480	male offender. And obviously, he would be violent towards us as police officers. Now that if you
621480	628520	read the paper, this may come across as if it was a like a kind of a one off incident. It wasn't,
628520	633800	you go to things like this all the time on a busy Friday or Saturday night, I could go to the two
633800	642520	or three of these maybe. So this was very, very normal, nothing out of the ordinary. And I said
642520	646920	to Jamie, okay, well, let's go on. We'll wait for some backup because he might be violent,
646920	651400	this guy and you know, we'll go in and we'll see what we can do. He's obviously going to need to
651400	660360	be arrested because of the damage that he'd done to the lady. And she said, no, I've got my one year
660360	666440	old upstairs and he's in bed. And the minute that she said that, like, we can't wait for backup,
666440	673160	we have to go in because there's a chance that the child could be injured. So obviously that
673160	677000	changed our decision making. And as we're working up the front door up to the front door, the door
677000	684200	opens and this big muscley guy comes to the front door. And the thing that got me at that time,
684840	688520	and again, I just have to stress like I got these with the very, very normal incidents,
688520	693320	like we'd go to these all the time, there's something about this incident where I felt
693320	700840	like my heart hit my stomach, big adrenaline dump, all of the prickles on my arm stood up,
700840	705960	like my hair stood up, power reaction, and up the back of my neck. And I remember looking at
705960	710040	Jamie, Jamie didn't feel this and I spoke to him afterwards. It was really strange because
710040	715480	there was two of us presented with the same incoming sensory stimuli. I had a very different
715480	720440	bodily reaction. And we talked about it afterwards. I mean, at the time, I would like to say I was
720440	725240	eight or nine years of experience, Jamie was like coming up to two. So there was a big buildup of
725880	733480	abasing priors in me for some reason. Anyway, let's cut long story short. We ended up fighting with
733480	741400	the male. He was very violent towards us, really, really bad incident. And when we finally got him
741400	744920	in handcuffs, as we got to the front door, we noticed that he dropped a knife and he'd had
744920	750920	the knife when I pulled him out of the doorway. Now, this is like one of those moments that you
750920	755240	have in a policing career where your mortality punches you in the face, you know, because
755240	759160	had we gone inside or had we engaged him in a very different way, there's a chance that
759720	766200	both of us would not have come away from the incident. And sometimes that like hits you and
766200	773160	it hit us both then. And Jamie got very upset. I remember it very distinctly. We walked into the
773160	777880	kitchen, we had to go and check that the young lad was okay. And he was. And obviously, we got the
777880	783720	injured party back into the house. But I remember doing like an immediate reflection afterwards
783720	791480	and saying to Jamie, like, I have never had this severity of bodily reaction like that
793400	798760	that came on so quickly. And I've used the word salience to describe it in the paper.
799400	803800	But there was something that was distinctly different. And I don't know what it was. But
803880	808600	obviously, whatever signals I was receiving, be it from the lady on the curb or from the
808600	813720	male's behavior as we approached door, there was something in me that told me intraceptively. So
813720	820040	it was an internal feeling that then triggered my cognitive processes to approach the incident
820040	827560	differently. Anyway, that incident, obviously he went to court, he went to jail actually.
828520	833400	So the incident itself, we managed to safeguard the lady in the sun, which is always a good outcome.
834760	840280	But for me, it really stuck with me for a couple of reasons. The first was that the bodily reaction
840280	845800	that was so different was something that Jamie didn't receive at all. So there was no difference in
845800	853960	him. He saw nothing of the evidence that I saw. And when I say saw, this is obviously, and again,
853960	858120	covering the paper, there's so much information that you're taking into these incidents. And it's
858120	864520	in such a temporal window that such a tight temporal window that your ability to be able to
864520	871400	affect the environment that you're in is very, very highly constrained. Because you're only going to
871400	878360	be at that incident, maybe for minutes, if you're lucky, an hour or over, depending on how busy
878360	885000	the radio is. So you can't do what you would call any longitudinal niche, niche construction,
885000	890600	your ability to mold or shape your environment when you turn up as a police officer is limited
890600	895000	solely to the time that you're there. And because you don't know any of the people there,
897000	900920	there's something going on in the police officer's brain. And again, this is discussed in the paper
900920	911640	that is very different to a normal work environment. So I'm just going to, I'll try my best to give
911640	916520	you an example. So if you work on a till and customer services, you have a very predictable
916520	921720	way of living your day out. And of course, the unpredictability comes from the customers.
921720	926520	But there's often a set of like procedures or protocols that you follow that enable you to
926520	931720	deal with those people in a particular way. And that allows you to predict your work and hopefully
931720	936760	comfortably do that. Now, when you're a police officer, you have the law. And this was interesting
936760	941320	actually, Daniel, because when we first had a chat about this, I think you put me in touch with
941320	945960	somebody who was talking about the law as an agent of active inference, which is proper
945960	951480	interesting stuff. And if we get time, like later on, it might be worth a discussion. But
952520	957400	the officers are working within the law. So you've got bounds, if you like, you have boundaries that
957400	964440	you work within. And there's particular actions you can take. But everything is so highly
964440	969000	unpredictable. I'm not working with a till and working directly with people. It's often in a
969000	972680	very, very emotionally charged environment, because that's why police get called in the
972680	977400	first place. You don't know any of the people that you're dealing with, and they're not coming to you
977400	981400	asking for the same service. So it's not like you're going up to a shop and saying, I want to buy
981400	986680	this again and again and again, which is the same thing that you'd get as a cashier. When we turn
986680	994360	up, a lot of the time, people don't even want police there. So you come in as like a kind of alien,
994360	998600	if you like, and there's often something that again, it's like high emotions, everything's
998600	1003560	going a little bit crazy. The decision making of those people is normally totally out of the norm.
1003560	1008520	You're trying to bring everything back within the norm. So if you like that the officer is like
1008520	1012360	an agent of our status, we're trying to bring back home your status to the environment and get there.
1013320	1019320	But it's so messy, and so difficult, that you often end up making decisions that other people
1019320	1023480	may look at and say, Oh, why have they done that? It's such a strange decision. But if you've been,
1024200	1028920	and I suppose in the paper when I go through it, if you've been in that particular situation a
1028920	1034760	number of times before, and you have a good set of Bayesian building blocks that allow you to make
1034760	1039480	but improve decision making as a result of that experience, you may end up with improved outcomes.
1040120	1048600	And I'm not going to say that you will, but you may. And it's a solid theory to back up
1048680	1053480	good experience led decision making. And there's lots of things that you can look at. And hopefully
1053480	1058120	the paper towards the end might be able to just talk about some of those and I can take the viewers
1058120	1065160	through them. So that's the kind of background. The salience of this particular incident is the
1065160	1070440	one that the paper is based on. It was so different to me during my police career that I needed
1070440	1078440	something that explained it. This theory explains it in a lovely way. It's so nice. And obviously the
1078600	1086200	kind of absorption of Carl Friston's work over time and the reading of the books. I mean,
1086200	1091720	that's inference book by Thomas Pye. I know that you're doing a series on it, a reading group on it.
1091720	1096440	It's brilliant. I would say it's a little bit hard going. Don't pick it up as your first book.
1096440	1100520	Do some listening to the podcast first, try and get your head around how it all works,
1100520	1104040	and then pick up the book and go through it. It gets a little bit heavy towards the end.
1104040	1107960	The experience machines are really good introduction. That's another good one. Andy Clark
1107960	1112520	talks about Active Inference Book. It's not an active inference book. It gives you a much wider
1112520	1118440	view on the cognitive neuroscience and how the active inference stuff is brought in.
1119080	1123880	But I really enjoyed that. And then obviously, when I'd had this idea and I'd written most of
1123880	1128280	the paper, I think I was at maybe, you know, six and a half, seven thousand words. I took the
1128280	1135480	lead and I emailed Mr. Friston. And I just emailed Professor Friston with a massive
1136280	1141960	chunk of humble pie and said, Professor, lovely to meet you. I feel like I know you because I've
1141960	1148120	watched you a million times online. This is what I've written. What do you think? And then
1149480	1157720	to my surprise, he sent me back another 800 words or so with a very heavy endorsement.
1159880	1162520	I was a little bit in shock. It's one of those moments where I was looking at my computer and
1162520	1167640	I was like, is that an email from? Oh my goodness. And then I opened the manuscript and I was like,
1167640	1175000	wow, okay, this is amazing. And then obviously a little bit more dialogue and we chose to
1175720	1180440	submit, but needless to say, and I mentioned this earlier in the podcast because I don't have a
1180440	1187000	background in maths or neuroscience. I'm fairly sure that those holes were evident in that first
1187000	1194200	draft. And Mr. Friston did an absolutely amazing job of plugging them. So I guess that's the story
1194200	1202440	behind the research, Daniel. Did that make sense? Yes, you good with that? Yeah, thank you.
1204200	1209240	Okay. Have you got any questions so far or do you want me to just wait through the paper quickly?
1209240	1214920	Yeah, let's look through the paper. Okay, cool. I'll just go to share screen then.
1217000	1224840	Okay.
1231400	1239640	Okay, is that? Yep, looks like. Okay, perfect. So I don't want to read the paper only because I think
1239640	1244840	everybody will dive boredom, but I will skip through the sections and explain to you my thinking.
1245560	1255320	So I go very gently into setting the scene, talk a little bit about how police officers are often
1255320	1259880	flung into what you would call vital high-stakes situations. And this is elaborated on a little
1259880	1264120	bit further, but it's that temporal nature of the decision making, which I think causes very
1264120	1268440	specific grooves in the police officer's brain. And I'm using the word groove because I think it's
1268440	1272680	a really good analogy that kind of like explains the brain. It's not that we can't step out of the
1272680	1277160	groove, but they help us make decisions. And I suppose that's in line with heuristics. It's
1277160	1282520	actually in line with like hemispheric theory, like all sorts of like, and I talk about this later,
1282520	1288200	like system one, system two thinking. This is all quite well-established, good psychological
1288200	1294520	research. It all kind of melds together. It gives you a good little background. So I talk about a
1294520	1301960	little bit of the history with regards to the hunch and what the hunch is. It's been described
1302040	1307720	using a number of different terms. So we've got suspicion in here. This was done on research that
1307720	1313480	was conducted when it comes to things like stop and search. And stop and search is such a
1314840	1322040	contentious area of policing. So high impact when it comes to things like community tension,
1322040	1329640	community confidence, trust, safety, legitimacy, a lot of it is linked with the use or the abuse
1329640	1336600	of stop and search. So there's been quite a lot of study that's looked at the decision to stop
1336600	1343000	and the decision to search, how those decisions are created and often through ethnographies,
1343000	1349320	where academics have gone out with police officers and watched officers conduct their
1350920	1356280	stops and their searches and how they've then asked after that's been done like,
1356280	1360200	how did you make that decision? How have you come to that decision to stop and search that person?
1360200	1365480	What was going on inside your brain? And I've then introduced the domestic violence incident,
1365480	1369560	which I've already discussed, so I'm not going to go through that. But I've just talked about this
1369560	1373640	bit here where it says this scenario creates fundamental question. How does an officer's
1373640	1379320	body generate these hunches, these internal alarm bells, and what role do they play in
1379320	1385320	navigating the experience of being a police officer? Now they're not restricted to police
1385320	1392040	officers and I talk about this here, especially when it comes to things like medicine and public
1392040	1403560	service based professions, armed forces, firefighting, etc. There's an excellent article and if I could
1403560	1408760	remember it, I would share it. But it was about a group of firefighters that went in there in the
1408760	1414360	midst of like, you know, fighting this crazy big fire and all of a sudden the supervisor just says,
1414360	1419400	right, get out, get out, get out. And he grabs all his team and he pulls them out and literally
1419400	1427720	within seconds the floor collapses. Now, obviously there's going to be no super particular salient
1428280	1433400	detail that's made him do that. It's going to be a gathering of details which are going on
1433400	1440280	often unconsciously in the midst of the fire. Even him, I imagine, can't process in a way that's
1440280	1445320	rational and deterministic. He can't say this led to this and then this led to this and then this
1445320	1451240	led to this. It just, this overwhelming feeling came to him as a firefighter and he said, no,
1451240	1457320	come out, come out quick. And as they came out, the floor collapsed. Now that's an example of the
1457320	1461560	hunch, but the hunch within a firefighting circumstance. It's the same thing. It's like a
1461560	1467720	kind of overpowering feeling of intuition. So I talk a little bit about this here and we talk
1467720	1473240	about it being a little bit wider than stopping a vehicle. There is a discussion here of
1475560	1480360	almost like the spectrum of what a hunch can be like. How does intuition present itself?
1480360	1484200	There is some research coming very shortly from somebody called Emily Quinn at Cambridge.
1485080	1489640	She's just done a PhD in something called the copper's nose, which again is the police hunch.
1489640	1495800	I didn't know about this until after I'd written it, but I know that she's done a data collection.
1495800	1500600	I know that she's much more hot on the terminology and the neuroscience and the cognitive science
1500600	1505320	behind this. And I know that her research is about to land. So just for the listeners,
1505320	1513080	it's definitely coming. That's going to be a treat when it lands. But a hunch or a copper's
1513080	1516920	nose when you're trying to find vehicles that may be up to no good, for instance,
1517880	1522280	I'd been in cars with people who are very experienced police officers and say something
1522280	1527240	like, I want to stop that car. I don't like the look of it. Now I'm trying to learn and
1527240	1530520	my immediate question would be like, well, what do you mean you don't like the look of it? What is
1530520	1537720	it about that car that's promoting this feeling of unease? And even the most experienced police
1537720	1543720	officers, they can't answer that question. They'll say something like, oh, well, maybe it's the manner
1543720	1549000	of driving, you know, but if it was the manner of driving, and I might have picked up on it,
1549000	1554760	there's something else, there's something that's, that's triggering. And I imagine their heuristics
1554760	1560040	and their heuristics that have built up over time. Again, it'll be Bayesian. There'll be tiny signs,
1560040	1566600	tiny inputs, sensory inputs about a particular vehicle and the way that it is behaving that
1566600	1573240	over time have led to the building up of this, this intuition. Now, that is a very, very small
1573240	1577240	slice of what is intuition, a very, very big slice of what is intuition might come in the
1577240	1581720	detective world. So if you're working on a murder case, it could be that you have a very
1581720	1587160	particular feeling about one of the suspects, and that feeling may build up over time. Now, again,
1587960	1592760	very, very difficult to explain. Why do you, why do you have a feeling that that suspect did or did
1592760	1598280	not do it? Why, why is it coming? And again, those detectives, and I know I've worked with them,
1598280	1603320	they can't explain it. There's something that's, that's building up for them and they can feel
1603320	1608440	the hunch. The hunch isn't something that's visceral. It doesn't come into the pile of erection,
1608440	1613240	kind of like, you know, like response to threat or response to stimulus that's severe. It's very,
1613240	1617800	very slow creeping. And it leads to like this. It's almost like intrusive thoughts, you know,
1617800	1622920	like they're very, very slow. They come in without their unbidden. There's no like kind of, I'm not,
1623640	1628040	very, very, I'm not happy with this. You know, this is not good. You know, it's uninvited.
1629160	1633000	So the hunch can manifest itself in lots of different ways from the kind of, I want to stop
1633080	1638600	that car. I don't like look of it to something that generates over weeks or months. And again,
1638600	1643800	it's very difficult to discern like, where does that sailings come from? We don't know. We don't
1643800	1648360	know. And that's one of the things that I think that should be looked at. And I discussed this at
1648360	1654920	the end when we talk about where the research could go. So again, I take them through the incident
1654920	1659080	which I've just discussed. And we talk a little bit about the background of intuition research.
1660040	1664360	And then we talk about rational decision making and intuition. There's a meta study there
1664360	1670280	from Wang, Wang et al. in 2017. He's talking about constructs and think they are separate.
1670280	1674600	They've run up on the dual cognitive system, system one, system two again, emotional thinking,
1674600	1678200	what you would call emotional thinking and rational thinking if you were being a Philistine like me.
1680600	1687480	So, yes. And then I very, very, tentatively, and I have specifically used that word,
1687560	1691320	I'll just highlight it there tentatively. With this prior discussion in mind,
1691960	1697960	the author posits a definition of a hunch for the following discussion, which is an often
1697960	1703320	unbidden, salient intuition experienced by a police officer that subsequently influences their
1703320	1709000	actions. Now, when I say influences their actions, I don't mean that it specifically
1709000	1712520	sends them in a particular direction. That direction can be anywhere. But it's the fact
1712520	1719000	that it causes some sort of change in direction or causes you to consider a change in direction
1719000	1724760	that then, so in other words, it's instrumental. It's not something that just pops up and it
1724760	1732440	can be dismissed. It does something. Now, there was some pushback a little bit on the definition.
1732440	1739160	So words were added as we went in and through from the reviewers who were amazing on the article.
1739160	1745800	They were so cool, gave lots of different editions or possible editions and talked about this.
1745800	1750280	And we ended up with this, this inclusion of the word salience to kind of
1750280	1754760	generate to describe a hunch, you know, like what, well, it's the salience of the hunch.
1754760	1759320	It's not like a normal hypothesis. Our brain is constantly generating hypotheses all the time.
1760120	1763400	But there's something about this particular hypothesis when it pops up.
1764040	1769080	Wham, it hits you. Okay. Well, what does that hit feel like? Where is it come from?
1769080	1773720	And why is it different to your normal train of thought? What is it that's made it pop out?
1775960	1783320	And that then leads to the maths. Now, some of the narrative, probably half ish,
1783320	1789080	that this is mine, some of its calls. And Professor Friston went into a lot more detail than me.
1789880	1794440	The equation that I put forward for surprise was tripled in length.
1795960	1801240	So he went into a lot more. This was the Bayesian brain bits. We introduced the Bayesian brain.
1803080	1808120	If you like the older research. And then we bring in the newer research data, for instance,
1808120	1817480	free energy principle. And then Professor Friston added the detail in the equations here.
1817560	1822200	And also the figures, which have come in, which are the background, if you like,
1822200	1825160	for these equations. How do these equations work? And what do they say?
1827000	1831320	But what's the gist? So if I was to describe this.
1833400	1836840	Surprising bounds or the level of surprise that somebody operates within.
1839160	1841800	A police officer is going to be very, very sensitive
1842760	1847880	to boundaries of surprise. This is the hypothesis, essentially because,
1848600	1852280	and I talk about this in the next section, which is about cultural niche construction,
1853000	1856440	because they have very little control over their environments and they have very little
1856440	1862120	knowledge of the people within them. I think that their brain will generate hunches
1863080	1869400	in a much more sensitive fashion within those constraints. So essentially,
1869720	1875880	and through the gathering of experience, very temporarily informed, if you like,
1877560	1883080	work environment. If I go to a domestic, and I walk into a domestic incident,
1883080	1886440	and the male and female are shouting and throwing things at each other, I have,
1887080	1894440	I have no discretion. I have to take action immediately because there's harm that can
1894440	1901400	take place at any point to either of the parties. So I have to take what is a very active role in
1901400	1907000	that environment immediately. And therefore, I'm constantly training my brain, I think, personally,
1907000	1912280	as a police officer, this is what I think goes on, to take action and to take action decisively
1912280	1919400	in order to reach desired outcomes. Now, in most people's daily business, they have lots of time
1919480	1924120	to make these decisions. And as a police officer, you just don't. And that generates
1925880	1929880	grooves. I think it generates grooves in the police officer's brain, and it leads to something
1929880	1934280	which has come out in the ethnographic literature around policing called pragmatism.
1934280	1940200	Now, it's described as a tendency to do over a tendency to think. So a police officer will often
1940200	1947080	tend, I think, towards jumping into some sort of very active role in the environment,
1947880	1954920	sometimes too quickly, way too quickly. But I think that too quickly, and I'm going to use
1954920	1961880	air quotes there, is Bayesian. I think that your brain is trained to intervene quickly
1961880	1967480	in many, many cases, and it sets up grooves. And those grooves are very easy to fall into.
1968520	1975720	And that presents risk. So I'll give you an example. If I'm going to be controversial here,
1975720	1981560	but this is where I think the research will be really cool. If, for instance, there is a drug
1981560	1986440	problem within a particular neighborhood, and that neighborhood is high in ethnic minority,
1987320	1994920	and it could be ethnic minority from anywhere. So in the UK, Albanian, for instance,
1995800	2000200	or it could be black in London, or it could be Afro-Caribbean. There's lots of different
2000280	2006360	ethnicities. But if there is a community which is heavy in a particular ethnicity,
2006360	2010360	and as a police officer, you are constantly interacting in what will be
2011880	2017800	highly temporal niche situations, normally violence-related, with that community,
2017800	2025320	that's going to influence the way that that officer thinks and reacts in other, maybe less
2025960	2033480	temporally influenced situations. So I'll give you a physical example. If I am going to
2035080	2040680	gang-related violence a lot, and I'm dealing with victims that have been injured as a result of
2040680	2047640	gang-related violence, if I do a stop and search in that same area, and I have been to all these
2047640	2052760	previous incidents, there's going to be a building up of influence and experience in me, which is
2052760	2059320	then going to change the way that I behave when I stop that car. And you will see this in the
2059320	2065800	research, this comes out in a lot of the way that police officers are perceived when they're dealing
2065800	2072040	with ethnic minorities, the way that police officers act, they're not the same when it comes to
2072680	2079640	majority population interactions. But I do think, and again, I'm pushing this theory way out from
2079640	2086440	beyond my paper here, I do think that we can probably find some evidence of why that may be the
2086440	2093480	case, and maybe prove empirically that the more incidents that you go to that could be highly
2093480	2098680	temporally influenced, that may involve particular ethnic minorities, could then change the way that
2098680	2103640	you as a police officer operate on a much more wider scale with members of that ethnicity. Now,
2105320	2108680	I don't think a lot of that's conscious, and I know because I've worked with police officers,
2108920	2114920	I mean, I met one racist police officer in my entire service of 18 years. So I know people say
2114920	2118840	other police officers, police, police are racist, you know, I don't think it's as simple as that.
2118840	2123320	I think it's way more complicated. I think that we have to really understand why police officers
2123320	2127720	make the decisions they do over time for us to properly unpick this problem. I don't think it's
2127720	2133320	something that we can turn the page on. And it's going to be years of good research, some of which
2133320	2139160	is alluded to in Andy Clark's book. So anyway, I'm going a little bit wide here, but all of this
2140120	2145880	influences that conversation that I've just had. I'm not going to go into the detail,
2145880	2152120	but that's the bit that is there. And we have this wonderful addition from him,
2152120	2155400	which gives you the background to the theory from Professor Friston.
2157160	2161000	Now, this is the section that if I had the choice, I would have put a lot more
2161960	2166360	words into. And this is the hundreds of niche construction stuff, and you'll probably be able
2166360	2173000	to tell that from how I've been talking about it today. But low surprise, longitudinal relationships
2173000	2179560	probably make up the vast amount of our interpersonal relationships that we all experience on a
2179560	2185240	day-to-day basis, all of us in general in the world, unless you're in somewhere that's very,
2185240	2190920	very volatile. Mostly they're going to be low surprise, longitudinal relationships. So you
2190920	2199160	are going to have more opportunity to mould the environment over time. So that's the active bit
2199160	2203800	of the influence. So you've got this ability to interact with the environment, the environment
2203800	2209160	then interacts with you, and you end up with this constantly forward and back in between you and
2209160	2214600	the environment. The problem is, of course, again, with police officers, the ability to
2214600	2220520	longitudinally change or influence an environment is just not there. You have, I have an hour at
2220520	2225160	most of the incident, and then I'm getting sent to another. And that may then cause, I think,
2225160	2232280	this pragmatic leaning to do rather than think. So that's the kind of what I'm getting to in
2232280	2239080	this last part here before moving into the discussion. So there's a couple of questions
2239080	2242280	that I've come up here. I've mentioned the pragmatism here from Loftus. This is from
2242280	2248280	the cultural literature. So what cognitive signals were generated by initial attendants that
2248280	2252840	contributed to the hunch generation? When the Bayesian brain processes these signals,
2252840	2257240	what is produced empirically during the process of active inference? What was the officer's
2257240	2263960	qualia? So how does the hunch present into consciousness? Massively complicated. And I've
2263960	2268360	even put it in the paper. We don't want to get into the consciousness debate because it's
2269320	2275800	absolutely fascinating, but it's just incredibly complicated. So there are some things here that
2275800	2280280	make that person aware. And this refers to that salience, which is in the definition.
2281080	2288920	How were those qualia interpreted? So when the hairs on my arm stood up, how did I see
2288920	2293400	the hairs on my arm standing up? So obviously, you're going to receive the signal, but how
2293480	2299320	do you interpret it and then turn that signal into action? These are questions that haven't
2299320	2306840	really been answered yet in this particular area. And then this last one, which I think,
2308120	2311480	it looks like an afterthought because it's one sentence, but it's not one sentence,
2311480	2316680	it's actually really important. How did the officer justify this hunch in later court proceedings?
2316680	2322440	And I have written hundreds, probably thousands of police statements over the years. And I know
2322440	2328440	that reading back those statements, they will read very rationally. They will read super rationally.
2328440	2335240	So my ability to rationalize my decision making, post decision making is way better than my ability
2335240	2342600	to interpret a hunch rationally. And there's a big disconnect there. So you end up with a lot of
2342600	2346760	obviously hindsight bias. If you stopped a car and you found some heroin, well, you stopped the
2346760	2350520	car because you think that there was drugs on the car. But as mentioned earlier, in the
2351160	2357560	article, sometimes that hunch is nonspecific. It's raised through experience. That's
2358600	2364600	very, very different, really different. And I don't think that officers have got the skills
2364600	2369960	to interpret the hunches well enough to make well-reasoned decisions. I think that they rely
2369960	2375960	upon intuition much more than they say they do. And I'm not, well, I know because I've been one
2375960	2380120	and I've been around them. I know how these things work. So I just don't think that it's been
2380120	2388360	researched well. And then as we get towards the end, we move into the, again, the theory
2389720	2394920	support from that figure. And we posit a series of areas for future research.
2396360	2400520	So we've got here longitudinal study on hunch development. So this is tracking the development
2400520	2404840	of hunches in police officers as their career develops. I think this is super interesting
2404840	2409480	because when I talked about going up to that door in the domestic and Jamie not feeling
2409560	2415640	anything and me having the most salient feeling I've ever had, there's something going on there.
2417000	2423800	So when does that start to happen? When do police intuitions become so noticeable and
2423800	2428680	powerful that people can see them and be able to act upon them or be able to notice them and
2428680	2434520	suppress them? Because even that is an interesting area. So if you are getting a hunch and you think
2434520	2440520	that hunch may be informed through past discriminations, then surely you need to be able to suppress
2440520	2447160	it. You shouldn't be acting upon it. So if you think, for instance, that there's an element
2447160	2452840	of discrimination in stopping a vehicle, you need to be able to notice that and stop that before it
2452840	2458040	happens. And it could be unbidden. And again, this is in the definition. So you haven't invited the
2458040	2463080	hunch. It just comes, but you may know that there's not enough there for you to make that stop.
2463560	2468200	There's not enough evidence. So something's going on and you need to be able to see that and stop
2468200	2472920	that happening. Comparative analysis with a little profession. So this is looking at the
2472920	2477560	generation of hunches, for instance, in the medical environment, neurobiological correlates.
2477560	2482680	So this was to look at neurobiological processes associated with hunch formation,
2482680	2487080	the use of brain and body imaging techniques. This is probably way above my pay grade,
2487080	2491800	but it will be super useful. And there is some precedent for it in very, very primitive studies
2491800	2497400	in the 70s and 80s that look at things like heart rate and blood pressure over the tour of
2497400	2504680	duty of a police officer. But it'd be brilliant to see that advance. Much more advanced wearables,
2504680	2509160	even looking at good scanning equipment, how are these hunches generated? It might even be one
2509160	2514840	for the future, but we thought we'd discuss it. The impact of training on hunch accuracy,
2514840	2519240	this is something that came from Professor Kempese. He was talking about training scars.
2519480	2524760	Have you heard of training scars, Daniel? No. So training scars are where
2526040	2532280	you constantly train in a particular way. Your grooves become very, very pronounced
2532280	2537080	in the way that you approach similar incidents because you train so much. And then when an
2537080	2542680	incident presents itself, your brain kicks you into those grooves, even though the grooves may
2542680	2549640	be inappropriate. So they can lead to, so for instance, taking a shot because that's a shot
2549640	2556440	you would have taken in training, despite the fact that that shot was non-justified. Or another one
2556440	2562280	where there's not enough threat in the training scenarios. So because of that, you act in a much
2562280	2568200	more slow and considered way when you need to act much more quickly. Both of those will be
2568200	2575800	considered training scars. And again, so overtraining may suppress good hunch
2575800	2580920	intuition or development. That's an idea. I'm not saying it's there, it's just an idea.
2582360	2587640	So diversity, and we'll discuss this quite a bit today. Insighting to potentially gendered
2587640	2593160	hunches. I mean, I'm super interested in that. Look, this plays out. When you look at the stats
2593160	2598920	of things like stopping vehicles, it is different. It's different from a gender basis. There's
2598920	2605720	something going on. No one's looking at it. I think this needs looking at. Operationalization
2605720	2613960	of hunches in policing. So when, and I'm currently planning a study that looks at this now, so using
2613960	2617560	both qualitative and quantitative methods, investigating the factors that contribute to
2617560	2622360	the activation and follow through of hunches. But to do that, you have to be aware that a
2622360	2627560	hunch is happening. And that's a that's the one of the things that we're trying to get our heads
2627560	2633320	around like, how do we, how do we make officers aware enough that intuition is kicking in? And
2633320	2638440	then when that intuition is kicking in, how do we help them describe it and also help describe
2638440	2643160	their decision making off the back of it? Because I think, again, if we go back to that pragmatism
2643160	2647160	side, I think the hunch kicks in the police officer makes the decision, but there's very
2647160	2652120	little rational consideration of the connection between the hunch and the action. So that's
2652120	2657080	something that I think we can look at. Comparative analysis of policing models, and I'll give you
2657080	2663160	a really quick and dirty example of this. So in the US, obviously, it's a coercive policing model.
2663160	2668680	In the UK, it's a consensual policing model. Both of those will change the way that hunches
2668680	2675960	are generated. They will. So have you heard of the touching the tail light on police vehicles? So
2676680	2684360	in the US, when a cop touches, stops a car, as the police officer walks towards the car to speak
2684360	2690200	to the driver, they touch the tail light. Now, there's lots of reasons for this. The first is that
2690200	2695080	you leave your fingerprint and DNA on the tail light. Okay. But if you think about what that's
2695080	2700200	doing in the officer's brain, the immediate consideration when he gets out of that car is,
2700200	2706040	I could die. And I need to leave evidence on this vehicle in front of me. Now,
2706760	2710280	I have stopped thousands of vehicles in my police career, and I have never once thought that.
2711240	2717400	And because I've never once thought it, I can hypothesize that the generation of hunches will
2717400	2724680	be way different in terms of sensitivity to an American police officer's generation of hunches.
2725320	2730440	Not least because the threat is so mitigated in the UK, the chances of me coming up against
2730440	2735720	firearm is almost nil. I have never seen a gun. I've never fired one till about six months ago.
2736360	2741080	So like 18 years of service, and I've never carried and I've never seen a gun in a real life
2741080	2745720	police environment, that's going to change the way that I police. And I do think that there'll be a
2745720	2750840	different operationalization of hunches as a result. And that's something that will be a fascinating
2750840	2758760	study. And then this one here, this impact of technological support, how does the use of technology
2760200	2764600	change hunch development? So for instance, and this is going to sound really weird, but
2764600	2770120	let's just say a police officer is trained to record when a hunch is received. And it could
2770120	2777400	be as simple as a tap on the wrist for a wearable or something similar. And that could then help
2777480	2782360	us correlate the types of incidents that police officers are at when they receive hunches. They
2782360	2786680	don't have to explain them. It's just like, where are you most likely to get them? Where
2786680	2791960	does your intuition manifest? And then we could look backwards at how it manifested and what it
2791960	2797560	did. And then the last one, which is the public perception and trust. Possible to investigate
2797560	2803160	how public perception and trust in law enforcement are influenced by officers reliance on hunches.
2803160	2808200	So I'll give you a quick example of this. If you rely on hunches to do stop searches,
2809080	2814680	and that means that you do more stop searches, that may affect community trust within that
2815880	2820200	that particular community where you conduct in the stop searches, that then becomes reciprocal.
2820840	2825960	So you rely on intuition to do stop searches rather than rational thought. That leads to a
2825960	2831320	rise in stop searches, leads to a rise in arrests, and also probably a rise in much more like
2832280	2837480	a friction based interactions with members of the public. Long term, that's going to lead to a
2837480	2844920	breakdown in relationships and possibly issues with legitimacy. So how the public perceive
2846920	2853000	the legitimacy of police actions. So that's just an example of where we could go on the big scale.
2853000	2858680	This last one's a very macro, like kind of level study. And some of these up here are much more
2858760	2864040	personally based. And Daniel, I think that's about it.
2867480	2874120	Thank you. Thanks for overviewing it. I have some questions and there's some great
2874120	2877320	questions in the live chat. So. Okay, that sounds good.
2880120	2886040	Wow. Many places to jump in. There's the fundamental tension with the
2886600	2897000	possibly arbitrary or hard to explain yet intuitive and honed nature of the hunch.
2898200	2907400	And about how the hunch has such a rich before, during, and after. There's kind of, there must
2907400	2914040	be something like hearing the code called on the radio. Yeah. And that setting a stage like,
2914040	2920600	I'm going to a comedy, I'm going to a horror movie, or it's this code and that's all that is
2920600	2925880	being passed through the blanket is just what code it is. And that's equivalent to like saying,
2925880	2931480	what is your prior? What do you prepare yourself for, given that it's just this number or that
2931480	2936760	number? And what are the costs and the sensitivities to like false positives and false negatives?
2938600	2942200	So there's a lot of stages to investigate, like looking forward to the hunch and then
2942200	2947640	looking back on it, where certain kinds of rhetoric or certain kinds of thinking are
2948440	2953960	privileged or supported by legal proceedings and saying something like, well,
2955160	2958840	I just didn't think it was that way in the moment, could be the most honest statement,
2958840	2961640	yet it might be seen as like almost malpractice.
2964600	2971080	Okay. Awesome questions from the live chat. Yes, exactly right. Okay. All right. Here we go. I'll
2971160	2977800	just read them basically in order they come in. All right. So Susan asks, does hunch lead to
2977800	2985080	epistemic foraging or pragmatic foraging? So let's just unpack that in the expected free energy,
2986040	2993800	decision making, functional, different policies are evaluated in terms of their epistemic value,
2994360	2999880	like expected information gain and pragmatic value, which is aligning observations
3000680	3009720	with your preferences. So how does that raising of the hunch then get pushed one way or another
3010520	3018520	into seeking more information epistemically or directly moving to take pragmatic action?
3019880	3026760	So I think that was a very nice way of summing up a lot of the discussion that where I talked
3026760	3032840	about the lean towards pragmatism, the desire for control for a police officer when they first get
3032840	3043320	there is like, it's almost primal. And I know that that's a big word to use. But they will, I think,
3043320	3051560	tend to lean incredibly strongly into the pragmatic and then move into the epistemic.
3052200	3059000	So, and if you think about this, this mirrors the court process, like if I turn up to an incident
3059640	3064600	and there's threat within the incident, the first thing that I want to do is, and I know the word
3064600	3070600	is awful because of the connotations it brings, but neutralise the threat. I want the threat gone,
3071160	3077640	because while the threat is there, my intuition is going nuts. I mean, it overrides everything.
3078120	3083320	I'll give you a very quick practical example. If I'm in an incident where I believe that the
3083320	3087880	male party in domestic violence is going to assault me or assault the victim while I'm there,
3089480	3096680	that my brain does not want to allow any epistemic foraging. No, there's a safety override and the
3096680	3102040	safety override is essentially make sure that this male is not going to assault you or assault the
3102120	3107800	other person before we start asking questions. And that safety override is often the thing that
3107800	3112040	people will look at and say, and this is what I meant when I talked about the difference between
3112040	3118520	jurisdictions. So, I would say that the safety override in the US is much more powerful than it
3118520	3123720	is in the UK because of the threat that's there, because of the availability of firearms. So,
3123720	3130120	you're probably going to find where there's more firearms, the link towards pragmatic foraging is
3130120	3136200	way higher, way, way higher. And then once that's done, neutralized, whatever word you want to use,
3136760	3142920	then that's when the longer form questions and the much more calm information gathering takes
3142920	3150920	place. So, really good question. There's definitely a lean towards pragmatic over epistemic,
3151640	3157960	but epistemic will happen and it just may come after the pragmatic. So, there could be a kind of
3157960	3166120	hierarchy, a hierarchy if you like affordances because of the situation that presents. Does
3166120	3172760	that make sense? Yeah, like to give a kind of a non-policing example, it's like you dropped an
3172760	3179400	object on the floor. If it was very surely just a soft carpet, you might feel around blindly and
3179400	3185480	epistemic foraging would have like a low risk. But if you strongly believed that there was like
3185480	3191640	other sharp objects on the floor, you would be way more skeptical with just kind of reaching
3191640	3197240	into dangerous locations. Daniel, can you answer my questions because that was way better than I
3197240	3209800	just did. Okay, next one. We'll each give a shot. Susan asks, how are police trained to avoid group
3209800	3218360	think i.e. not just follow the ones with improper force over motivations? So, you're talking about
3218360	3225160	individual cognition in that moment, but yet in that dyad encounter, there was like a collective
3225160	3234840	intelligence component and a difference in hunches. So, how does the group training and operating come
3234840	3243480	into play? Yeah, this is really interesting because there's nothing about the way that your
3243480	3251240	brain behaves under pressure in any of the police training. Nothing. So, and I suppose, and this is
3251240	3257080	a massive criticism and I used to talk about this a lot because I was involved in the design of what's
3257080	3262440	called the PQF in the UK, which is the Education Qualification Framework. And it was a very,
3262440	3268600	very controversial project for me to be involved in, but it was about raising the initial level
3268600	3274840	of education to a degree level, bachelor's level for police officers. And one of the major drives
3274840	3282600	is obviously to blunt to some extent the lean towards pragmatism and offer some priors for
3282600	3288520	the making of police decisions that are better than those based just in practice. But this is a move
3288520	3294760	away from what you would call like a kind of master apprentice model, which is the, and it's
3294760	3300840	experience based epistemic model now of police learning into something that's much more a priori,
3300840	3308520	which is your more traditional, educative professionalized model. So, are they taught to
3308520	3312520	ignore group thing? I'd probably say, well, there was no discussion of group things during my training,
3312520	3316680	but I have to think back, I mean, my training was 23, 24 years ago, and I'm sure that things have
3316680	3326520	progressed. Will it be good informed, solidly evident stuff? Probably not. And I think in some
3326520	3330920	cases, I think there may be some really good academics who will be out there working with
3330920	3335880	particular forces, and they will be given this sort of training. But I think it's a more general
3335880	3340760	approach. I don't think it's there. And I think it's a massive gap. So really good question.
3341720	3354120	All right. Yeah, very interesting. It's a team sport, team art slash science. And so,
3355080	3362760	it has to be at least considered how do officers share their hunches? They just raise their hand
3362760	3367800	and say, I have a hunch. But that might be throwing a wrench into things in the moment.
3368760	3377480	So, how do the right communication surface, and then you have the radio, and you have the
3377480	3383160	local communication, you have these different avenues of message passing, but not all messages
3383800	3390680	lead to resolution of the situation. So, Daniel, that's a really good comment. And we're just
3390680	3395400	submitted a paper, which is on the use of decision making models in detective world.
3396040	3401560	And we were talking about this, like, I was only on a murder inquiry for a year of my service. So,
3403160	3407960	but I saw the way that the murder inquiries worked. And it is way more rational. And they
3407960	3413320	invite hunches. So, like, you're seeing your investigating officers will say, look, have any
3413320	3418680	of you got any feelings about this? Please try and explain them, you know, how or the other one
3418680	3422280	where you just run an interview with one of the suspects. And one of the first questions that
3422280	3427560	would come out isn't what did the suspect say? It's, what do you think? How did it make you feel?
3428120	3434440	You know, so there's a real space within the detective world for the discussion and sharing
3434440	3442360	of hunches. Now, if I pick that same instance up and you drop it into uniform, because it's so
3442360	3448120	temporarily enforced, that you won't get chance a lot of the time to share your hunches. Like,
3448120	3453240	so if I have a bad feeling about somebody at an incident, and this is that lean towards
3453240	3458840	pragmatism again, I will want to make sure that I'm safe before I go anywhere. I won't share
3458840	3464760	with the officer next to me, I have a bad feeling about that person. I want to take pragmatic action
3464760	3469480	to go and try and deal with that bad feeling. So again, this leans back into that other question
3469480	3474520	that we've just discussed. I would say that so the sharing of hunches and the passing of messages
3474600	3483160	probably much more available within the long decision making processes within detective work
3483160	3489320	and very poor within the incredibly short, temporarily influenced decision making of
3489320	3497400	uniform. Does that make sense? Yeah, it also makes me think about active inference and
3497400	3503640	statistics are providing like a science of uncertainty and decision making amidst uncertainty.
3503720	3511880	And yet in many different domains, ranging from policing to law, science, there's kind of
3512760	3519400	bespoke ways of dealing with uncertainties. And different settings even within the given
3519400	3524680	field like different cases are going to have different treatments of uncertainties. And so
3525640	3534440	there's now this dance or a fusion to bring together those different treatments of uncertainty.
3535960	3542280	I'm really curious how you see active inference and extended cognition in light of
3543720	3548760	even though I'm not very familiar with the details, the growth of policing technologies
3548840	3556680	and surveillance technologies and the different paths that a given officer or department might have
3556680	3563480	in front of them in terms of how they incorporate technology into their whole apparatus.
3565080	3568040	So there's definitely going to be a really, really big shift here.
3569480	3575640	So when I left two or three years ago, there were discussions three years ago about things like
3575720	3585480	the integration of active heads up displays. Okay, so when I'm at an incident, if I've got facial
3585480	3591320	recognition, and it's running in the background, and it's passing me information that I don't have
3591320	3598520	and didn't have, how will that affect my decision making? And that is, and I'm going to be really
3598520	3607320	honest, really scary, because really scary and really beneficial. So I'll give you a quick example.
3607320	3611160	I turned up at an incident again, I'm going to keep using the domestic incident because it's
3611160	3616040	simple and we as police officers go to them all the time. Okay, so it's a, and I keep calling
3616040	3619800	myself a police officer. I'm not a police officer anymore, I'm full-time academic, but you know,
3619800	3627320	one time. So anyway, if I turn up at an incident and I have a set of glasses and my body cam on,
3627320	3631640	my body cams running at all times. So I know that there's some element of surveillance of my
3631640	3636600	behavior. And I know that whenever you look back at this incident, my decision making is going to be
3637960	3644280	scrutinized. Okay, so when it goes into the court system, my behavior will definitely be on show.
3644280	3648440	And I know that as a result, obviously, I have to behave within the rules and the bounds and all
3648440	3653880	that sort of thing. Now, there's a propensity, and I'm sure you know this, of police officers to do
3653880	3659160	what's called informal working practices, where they essentially step outside the strict rules and
3659160	3666680	laws and they try and take pragmatic decisions. So an example might be if I stop somebody speeding,
3666680	3670920	I might want to give them a warning, I might not want to give them a ticket. But speeding is
3670920	3675320	technically a strict liability offense, so I should have to give them a ticket. And instead,
3675320	3680760	I operate and I use discretion, I decide not to do it, I give words of advice and that person drives
3680760	3687240	off. Okay. With things like your heads up display, if I'm walking towards that car, and I'm wearing
3687240	3694680	glasses that is giving me full history, full driving history, including infraction, speeding,
3694680	3699720	tickets, et cetera, just by looking at the number plate. And then when I get up to that
3700680	3704440	driver's side window and the window comes down and my facial recognition tells me that this
3704440	3710520	person has got previous for X, Y, and Z, a soul, et cetera. Is that going to change my decision
3710520	3717640	making 100% because what has the police officer got to deal with now? They have what's in front of
3717640	3724600	them. And then they do that epistemic foraging. The extended cognition that would come from
3724600	3732600	lifetime information during decision making is crazy. And I'll tell you right now, we'll be doing
3732680	3739480	it before we understand whether it is a good thing to do or not. Because that's what police do,
3739480	3744040	they will jump in probably. In fact, I'd be surprised if people weren't testing this stuff now.
3746840	3752120	And the other thing I think, I mean, I went straight to wearable stuff there, but there's
3752120	3757400	other stuff that might help. So if I'm thinking from an interceptive perspective, there's a really
3757400	3765240	good study called Emotional Survival for Law Enforcement Officers. It was a police psychologist
3765240	3773160	that wrote it. And he put heart rate monitors on police officers. And he showed that when you go
3773160	3777000	into what's called a Code 1 incident in the UK, which is an emergency incident, the blue lights
3777000	3780840	are on, you know, like you were talking about the code, the pattern of the information and the
3780840	3786520	bodily reactions to it. If I'm going to an emergency incident, when I first start, you're
3786520	3791800	incredibly aware, interceptively, of what's going on. So you can feel your heart, your
3792600	3801000	breath quickens, your periphery narrows, all of the normal stress reactions kick in.
3801000	3804760	Okay. Because you know that when you land there, there's probably going to be conflict of some
3804760	3808920	sort and you're going to have to deal with it. Now, what the study showed was that
3810440	3815240	very, very experienced police officers, so we're talking like 15 years, 20 years plus,
3815240	3822440	when they were going to the emergency incidents, they would say that those bodily reactions were
3822440	3830760	not happening. But the monitors would say that they were. And this is super interesting.
3831640	3837080	Because it may mean, you could say that the police officer has got more control over their
3837080	3843400	interception, or you could say the exact opposite. So they have dulled their interception over time
3844360	3850280	through exposure, continued exposure. And we don't know about the effects on hunches,
3850280	3856040	or the effects on general decision making in those different lengths of service, if you like.
3856040	3861480	Now, if we go back to the extended stuff, imagine having a wearable that tells you this
3862120	3868360	lifetime. That would be super interesting. Like it, I mean, again, I'm like, you know,
3868360	3872440	maybe five years in the future here, but we're not a million miles away. There are well-being
3872440	3876040	wearables that are ongoing now. I don't think they're being used for this purpose.
3876040	3881880	Could they change decision making? Definitely. In good and bad ways, hey,
3882600	3887320	I know this just needs a lot more research, this bit that you're discussing, loads more research.
3887320	3892440	It just needs some proper, proper good looking at, because it could be immensely beneficial.
3892440	3895320	I can just see a million ways where it could also be quite damaging.
3895880	3906040	Wow. Yeah, the awareness of the hunch. And then there's one setting where the hunch is not
3906040	3913000	aroused, which may be like a burnout situation. Yeah, exactly. And then yet also on the other
3913000	3920040	side of, let's just say, like a stage performer, they still might get the physiological arousal,
3920120	3925720	but they actually expect it. And so they don't attend to it because this whole thing with
3925720	3932200	active is not paying attention to what we expect. And so they have a deeper experience layer that
3932200	3938760	contextualized the hunch. And yet that might obscure that hunch from being communicated,
3938760	3947240	like to a younger colleague, and yet communicated where and how the experienced professor or
3947240	3957320	lawyer or officer feels in a situation is that ineffable experience transfer. And then I totally
3957320	3966360	see these different paths with the wearables, one path where the boots on the ground are just
3966360	3971160	reduced to an actuator in a decision making system that they're not even a part of.
3971880	3974840	Because it tells them, here's what you want to do to this car.
3975560	3983320	Don't epistemically forage, just fulfill what the order is. Exactly. And then there's the
3983320	3989240	epistemic engagement mode. And we can imagine like the family doctor asking somebody questions
3989240	3995320	rather than like looking at their digital health record. And there's kind of, there's a charming
3996120	4003240	and an open-endedness to that. And yet in high reliability situations, people are going to be
4003800	4010040	put into which lane are we going to take this doctor's office? Are we going to use digital
4010040	4016840	health records? Or are we going to have slower, potentially noisier encounters just because
4016840	4024520	people self-report that they like that more than the other way? Yes. Yeah. And just as you got me
4024520	4030040	thinking that there's some really good studies that look at things like cancer diagnosis. And so
4030120	4034440	you know, somebody comes in with a bad ankle and a doctor says, yeah, you need to go for this test
4034440	4039720	and this test and this test. And they're unable to rationalize that. It's the same thing, but there's
4039720	4045720	a much more. So if you look at a doctor's purpose, they're still going to be pragmatically based.
4045720	4050920	They're going to be trying to solve whatever problem is facing them. But their relevance
4050920	4055080	realization has got so skilled over the years. And this is some of the stuff that you were just
4055080	4060600	talking about there, where there's lots of signals coming in that are just very, very
4060600	4065880	efficiently dealt with subconsciously. And it may be about making that person aware of what
4065880	4069800	that subconscious is doing in order to properly understand it. And this is what I was talking
4069800	4075960	about with the hunch generation stuff. Because police officers don't often, they don't interrogate
4076600	4081320	the journey that led them to make the decision, they make the decision and then they rationalize
4081400	4088440	it backwards. I think there's so much we could do here. There's so much potential because, and again,
4088440	4092680	this is for improved decision making. This isn't like, so we're looking at improved outcomes here.
4092680	4096360	We want to make policing better. How do we make it better? Well, I would say that increasing
4096360	4101800	self-awareness about decision making is absolutely fundamental. You can't go anywhere. This is just
4101800	4110360	like perfect, you know, and the whole framework of active inference and the Bayesian brain,
4110360	4115960	it just lends itself to this so well, way better than the other theories that I'd explored. And
4115960	4121400	some of which are in the article, like, you know, like the schema, the script, et cetera. But I
4121400	4126600	love Bramsted's work on niche construction in it. That's something I think that I would like to look
4126600	4130520	at a little bit more, I think, because as time goes on, sorry, my brain just went there towards
4130520	4136200	the end. I don't know why. Is there anything else on your question wise? Have we got some more?
4136200	4140280	Yeah. Yeah. Okay, let's keep going with questions. Jeff asks,
4153240	4155720	I don't know the book, but what do you think of the general question?
4156680	4165000	I don't, but I have. So I work in a security and defense academy. So I'm surrounded by
4165000	4169560	military scholars. That's a really good question. And I will go and ask it for Jeff.
4171800	4174680	Cool. Okay. Dave asks,
4185720	4189320	Oh,
4199400	4206200	that's a really good question. And I have to be honest, I mean, I've read some stuff
4206200	4211400	on hallucinations, and I've listened to podcasts from machine learning street talk as well as some
4211960	4217560	good discussions around it. I mean, they're anomalies, aren't they? But
4220120	4225000	and I suppose you're going to have a set of rules within the LLM that still allows them to be
4225000	4229480	displayed in the same way that you're going to have a set of rules within the body that allows
4229480	4237960	the hunches to come to the fore. I don't know is the answer to that. And I know that we don't
4238040	4243640	properly understand hallucinations yet. But I would, I mean, obviously, we've got no consciousness
4243640	4249800	in in the deep learning machines point of contention, but most people would say there's no
4249800	4257400	consciousness there. Whereas the hunch, the hunch is ability to rise through the consciousness.
4257400	4263000	So the quality of the hunch is the bit that makes it salient. And I think that that salience
4263000	4270200	will be lacking in any element of LLM deep learning based work, if that makes sense. Does
4270200	4278440	that make sense, Daniel? Yeah, I think another complimentary way that I thought of that question
4278440	4286200	is the hallucinations, let's just say in image output, you say represents this, and it makes a
4286200	4292440	full resolution image that is non factually based. And so people sometimes refer to it as a hallucination.
4293240	4302440	So whereas the outputs of that are in terms of observations that are just factually ungrounded,
4303080	4312200	the hunch, it's not like it's a, it's not a visual phenomena. It's not like there's a visual,
4312200	4319720	a new visual overlay or a sensory prediction. It's something slower that is kind of like
4320440	4327320	an upwelling of something that is salient, because as you pointed to, it's slower, it's
4327320	4336360	interceptive, it's affective. It's not modifying like what we see, smell here in the way where
4337000	4342440	when people talk about hallucinations as outputs of machine learning models, they're usually
4342440	4345880	talking about that. I think you might do that though, Daniel. That sounds really weird, but
4345880	4353560	I think it may to some extent do that. So and I'm just thinking about how that might be the case.
4353560	4362040	So if I'm at an incident, I'll give you another very quick example. So we went to conduct a
4362040	4365960	mandatory section in which is a horrible incident and I hate them, but it's essentially taking
4365960	4372440	somebody into full-time mental health care. He was a serious schizophrenic with, he was a danger
4372440	4379000	to others. And we went to basically take him into custody so that he could go to the hospital
4379960	4383960	because he wasn't, he wasn't refusing to take his medication or short for his appointments,
4383960	4389320	and it was carrying the community, et cetera, and he had to attack somebody. And I was in that room
4389320	4397240	for probably one minute and I was telling the doctors to get out because I knew what was coming.
4398200	4405160	And if somebody had, and this is what you say, well, it changes the way that you see,
4405160	4411640	well, it does because it changes your relevance realisation is that as the intuition kicks in
4411640	4417160	and becomes stronger, then your focus changes visually. So you're going to be filtering out
4417160	4421880	much more of the side if you like and focusing in on what would be considered the threat,
4421880	4427480	whatever the threat may be. And in this case, I mean, he was holding a knife down the side of
4427480	4432840	a sofa and he was about to attack us. And for some reason, something about that incident, again,
4433480	4439720	highly salient feeling, it then changed the way that I saw, it changed the way that I interacted,
4439720	4447000	communicated, changed the way that I dealt with my externals, and I suppose you could call them
4447000	4451880	variables. So I wanted all the people out of the way, because that would then give me greater,
4453080	4458600	that would give me less to think about when the conflict actually happened. So I would probably
4458600	4465800	say, there's a little, there's a parallel there, I think that it can affect the senses. And I imagine
4467960	4470920	no, I quite like it. It's an interesting thing to think about.
4471800	4479080	I saw in the paper, you cited the quantum reference frames and Chris Fields' work,
4479080	4483400	so that just makes me think walking down a street, one reference frame is just like,
4483400	4489320	oh, there's people milling about. And then another reference frame, whether this is paranoid or not,
4489320	4495560	is like, their information to circle me, or somebody is shaking a little bit in their hand,
4495560	4500600	and it's like, oh, maybe they have essential tremor. Maybe they're nervous. Maybe they're
4500600	4507400	about to do this. And so that doesn't change the, the photons hitting the retina.
4508040	4513000	That's right. It changes our framing. And that is what is actionable.
4514520	4524040	And a more cognitively informed law and legal system could have a more
4525000	4533080	agreed. Yes, you're right. Yes, you're exactly right. Yeah. Yes. Very good. I told you, you're
4533080	4539960	way better at this, Daniel. You wrap up my words and it just comes out in a much simpler way. Very
4539960	4549800	good. Let's, we're cruising together. Well, where are you going to go in your continuing directions
4549880	4555720	here? Like, what are you going to do with this now that you have the frontier's paper?
4556760	4561320	Okay, so there's a couple of things that I want to do. I want to
4563880	4574360	test whether current decision making models in policing that are used widely in many different
4574440	4583960	countries are useful for the processing and understanding of police hunches,
4585080	4589400	because I think that they are accountability models and not decision making models. So that's
4589400	4595960	something that I want to look at. But I suppose the more relevant study will be research in the
4596920	4604440	quality of the hunch. So within different settings, especially within uniform, I'm very
4604440	4610120	interested in it because of its, its contact with legitimacy as a whole, like how police
4610840	4618760	are perceived. I want to know how uniformed officers receive, understand, process, and then act upon
4619560	4626680	hunches. And the study that I have in mind is, this is going to sound really weird.
4627800	4633560	I want to do like a kind of personalized dictophone, like a narrative account. So essentially,
4634200	4639480	when a police officer in any corner of the world makes a decision on the basis of a hunch,
4640200	4646760	that is then narrated into this kind of like repository. And we use that repository as a
4647720	4654760	qualitative evidence base to research how the hunch is processing and then acted upon.
4654760	4662760	That's what I'm thinking. So I'm currently in the process of getting funding. And I'm hoping that
4662760	4667640	I can secure it. And if I can, I'd like to run it as a, this is going to sound really strange,
4667640	4674200	but a voluntary, worldwide study. So I don't care where you're a police officer. I want you to take
4674200	4683560	part. And we look at how you are receiving on a daily basis, your minor hunches from I want to
4683560	4689480	stop that car through to those like kind of heart hitting your stomach, pile or reaction,
4689480	4693960	high threat hunches that totally change the way that you see the incident in front of you.
4693960	4701560	So that's the, that's the next step, I think. That makes me think of Aeroid, which is a repository
4701560	4709880	of alternate states of consciousness, mostly based upon substances. So yeah, that's another,
4710440	4718360	but it's a voluntary self-report. And that sounds very cool and voluntary.
4719400	4724840	I'm hoping, I'm hoping that's the plan. But I'm hoping that once I get the funding,
4724840	4729560	that that will be a green light. And obviously in the meantime, I mean, it's been so cool talking
4729560	4736040	to you, Daniel. And I know that the community is quite tight in around the Active Infants Institute.
4736760	4741320	So if anybody has been listening or if anybody listens to this in the meantime, if you've got
4741320	4747240	any cool ideas or you want to ask me any questions, but just email me. I love to talk about this stuff
4747240	4750920	in general. And the discussion, I know that we mentioned it right at the beginning, but even
4750920	4755160	the discussion where we talked about the law, I've got, I've got a theory that I've spoken to a
4755160	4761080	professor about. I'll just throw this out there just to finish off. I think that people may call the
4761080	4771320	police when the surprising bounds are breached. And they want the police to be an agent of return.
4772040	4776520	So essentially, the police become an agent of our stasis to return to home your stasis for
4776520	4783160	that person. Now, what that gives us, and it's something that we don't have, is a general theory
4783160	4790200	of police contact. And it allows us to see how different communities may call the police based
4790200	4796040	on their different surprising bounds. So for instance, in high chaos communities, their
4796040	4802600	sensitivity to surprise is going to be much higher than those that are in, sorry, much lower than
4802600	4810920	those that are in very, very structured gated communities, for instance. And this, this could
4810920	4816360	lead us to some really interesting research. But it's something that is very much in the
4816360	4821160	background of my brain and something that I'm, I'm thinking about a lot, reading about a lot,
4821160	4829960	and hoping that maybe over time, I can start to develop it. Awesome. Thank you, Gareth, for
4831320	4837000	connecting these critical areas and bringing active in. And it's just exciting to hear where it's
4837000	4841480	going. Oh, thank you, Daniel. Thank you for your time. And thank you to everyone who's actually
4841480	4846120	managed to listen to me for, to drone along for this long piece. It's been a pleasure to have you.
4846120	4851240	Oh, there's great comments in the live chat. So thank you. Talk to you next time. Okay. Thank you
4851240	4852440	very much. Bye bye.
