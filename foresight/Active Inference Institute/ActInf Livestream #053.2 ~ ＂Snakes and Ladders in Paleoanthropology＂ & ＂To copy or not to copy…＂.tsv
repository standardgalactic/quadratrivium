0	5120	to copy or not to copy. That is the question from chimpanzees to the foundation of human
5120	13200	technological culture, recently appeared in physics of life reviews. Let me see if this works. Yeah,
13200	20960	sorry. So it all starts with a jigsaw puzzle. And the puzzle is why a highly innovative species
20960	27040	like chimpanzees do not live in a complex technological world. So we know chimpanzees are
27040	32400	very inventive. They are very creative. They are insightful. They can learn socially.
33440	41120	But what we don't see in the same extent or similar extent we see in humans is the accumulation
41120	46720	of complexity across generations. So you can see here in these images, we have one of the more
46720	52800	complex and demanding tasks that chimpanzees perform, cracking nuts open, and they can combine
52800	57920	different tools. They can use it in the appropriate order. So this means they are very insightful.
58560	64400	And yet, if we compare it with a rocket that can bring civilization to Mars,
65840	70960	it is clear that the accumulation of technology across generation works very differently in humans
70960	79520	and other non-human species. So the basic question or the one million dollar question is why does
79600	84720	innovation fail to translate into technological cumulative complexity in chimpanzees?
85840	91040	Does it owe to a limited capacity to copy with fidelity? Or what we referred
91840	97040	as true imitation, which means reproducing not only the end result that would be emulating
97040	102720	or emulation, but also the steps that lead to that end result. So according to this view,
103360	109680	further to copy innovation with faithful accuracy, hampers their intra and intergenerational spread,
109680	115680	and any ensuing ratcheting up effects. So possibly when copying with fidelity is impeded,
115680	121040	innovative performances are unlikely to lift their protagonist. And this brings us back to the
121040	126800	discussion we had the other day in The Snakes and Others paper where we said that after two
126800	134960	million years ago, Iriomo produced these almond-shamed bifacili flaked stones. But these
136160	142880	kind of artifacts that we don't even dare to call them tools were not copied by
142880	148240	conspecific observers because perhaps they were not attributing to them any kind of functional
148240	156240	use. So perhaps they were not seen as tools and were the result of manual inactions.
156880	166080	So to ratchet up complexity, it is important that inventions, that is tools, are copied with
166080	170800	sufficient fidelity so that they retain the fundamental features or attributes that make
170800	175920	them functional. So following the steps of demonstrated tool manufactured by an expert
175920	182320	model to the letter is the simplest, fastest and cheapest way to make sure that copies of the
182320	190640	original artifact are accurate. And here cheapest we refer to in terms of expenditure of energy.
191600	197680	So if the copies are functional, hence useful, they keep circulating in the group community
197680	203760	longer. And these skills increase the opportunities for one or more individuals different from the
203760	210160	original inventor to add in complexity. So for example, one individual invents a wooden spur
210240	217200	and 100 years later the smelting of copper is discovered and another individual adds to it
217200	220480	to this spur a sharp copper point and so on.
223360	230640	So here is an interesting concept of ratchet effect that would explain in part why humans
230640	236880	have built such complex cultural and technological work. So the idea of the ratchet effect is that
236880	242480	no generation starts from scratch. Instead, inventions and cultural products created by
242480	248480	one generation are kept in mind and transmitted to the next generation. This way, every generation
248480	254560	is better off supposedly than the one that preceded it. So here we can think of books,
254560	262480	books are a wonderful way of keeping information, sharing it across generations and among the same
262480	269120	generation also. So thus technological complexity and success in humans is not dependent solely
269120	274960	on the geniality of one or few individuals. It is a joint endeavor where many individuals
274960	280400	contributed specific expertise and skills to produce increasingly complex artifacts.
280960	288080	And again, we can think in establishing a colony in Mars, no single human alive could achieve that
288080	293760	alone or we have the required expertise to achieve that alone, but all together we can
293760	300640	perhaps manage that. So we need this kind of shared knowledge and accumulated accretion of course.
303440	311120	So why it is some behaviors or innovation are copied or not can be explained at the level of
311120	317120	social dynamics but also at the level of the brain or giving a more mechanistic explanation.
317200	321520	So explanation of why coping of certain behavior in chimpanzees does not occur with frequency
321520	326880	have been often kept at the level of social dynamics where factors such as social prestige,
326880	333040	dominance, etc. are said to be key to explaining whether or not an invention is adopted by observers.
333920	338480	And this is a problem against the brain to a subsidiary role. Here, Michael and I will
338480	344000	be attempting to identify what the minimum cognitive requirements are that can give rise
344000	350720	to innovations and their horizontal and vertical transmission. And we also attempted to differentiate
350720	356960	the cognitive ingredients necessary for innovation from those that need to be in place for the adoption
356960	362080	of an innovation. So we wanted to establish a clear demarcation between the brains of the
363120	367840	ones that innovate and the brains of those who observe an innovation because we think this
367920	375760	is important to be analyzed separately. So in order to see which are the mechanisms
376640	381680	at the level of the brain that would allow for one innovation to be copied, we invoked
381680	388480	the lens of the free energy principle. According to active inference under the free energy principle,
388480	394000	it is through there being limited to a certain number of states that is the attracting set
394000	400080	that organisms minimize the variational free energy of the internal states and resist entropic
400080	406320	dissipation. Minimizing variation of free energy reduces prediction sensation discrepancies,
407040	412240	prediction errors that can be corrected by active sampling of predicted sensory inputs
412240	417760	and perceptive modification of predictions. This is sometimes expressed in terms of perceptual
417760	424320	inference that is changing predictions to mad sensations and active inference reactively
424320	434480	changing sensations to match predictions. So innovation in a way might represent a potential
434480	439680	misfireings from a Darwinian perspective. So minimizing variational free energy can be achieved
439680	444560	through action, sending creatures can act, active inference in order to fulfill their predictions
444560	448480	and thereby reduce discrepancy between the latter and sample reality.
449600	454960	Being limited to a certain number of states, what we could refer to as the attracting set,
454960	461200	is therefore synonymous with minimizing variational free energy and hence maximizing adaptive fitness.
462640	468080	Here innovation represents an anomaly and innovators are unorthodox actors or protagonists
468080	474000	who entertain new courses of action or plans. New phenotypical responses that have not been
474000	479760	previously entertained and according to this interpretation of the free energy principle,
479760	483680	it is at the level of policy selection where innovators stand apart from the crowd.
484480	490000	Their policy selection is in a sense faulty insofar as their ensuing behavioral outcomes are
490000	496080	in more contrast to those of their fellow actors who deploy orthodox responses that reduce discrepancies
496080	501600	between predictions and sensations thereby reducing the prediction error. Here when we talk
501600	507120	of misfireings, we don't do it in a kind of negative sense, it's just to express that
507840	512800	these new behaviors, these innovations necessarily will produce more surprise.
515920	523360	Okay, seeing surprising things, with this phrase I am kind of paraphrasing Andy Clark
523360	529360	in a paper in Behavioral and Brain Sciences. He referred to seeing surprising things to being
529360	535040	able to lend credibility to the sensory information that is not in accordance to prior beliefs.
536160	541520	So the family of priority density is entertained by an individual irrestricted to the systems,
541520	547200	the brains prior by some beliefs. Equivalent, roughly speaking, to its phenotypical repertoire.
548080	554000	This means by definition that innovative behaviors both are likely to be missed in any given phenotype
554080	558080	and, crucially, difficult to recognize when observed by another.
559600	565040	Should an innovator's behavior diverge markedly from the repertoire of plausible policies used
565040	570720	usually by an observer to predict another's behavior, it may be beyond the capacity of
570720	577760	the latter's generative model to recognize it, that is, to make sense of it. So large discrepancies
577760	584240	pose a threat to the brain, because one, updating involves making energetic demands, and two,
584240	589840	risk-reducing adaptive fitness by inappropriately changing the generative models. And here we
589840	594880	need to think that the generative model has been selected also in a specific economy, so changing
594880	604720	it might have risks. Okay. So what is required for a brain to entertain generative models that
604720	611600	involve unusual or bizarre behaviors? The hierarchical predictive interpretation of the brain,
611600	618080	or hierarchically mechanistic mind, an amphibious inference machine, sorry, implies that each level
618080	623280	of the hierarchy of cerebral neuronal circuits conveys predictions or conditional expectations
623280	628960	that suppress errors at the level below, while concurrently conveying errors that permit the
628960	636080	revision of the expectations at the level above. Possibly, dynamical precision weighting enables
636080	641600	the system, that is, the brain, to readjust the confidence afforded to top-down expectations
641600	647840	as opposed to bottom-up prediction errors. In other words, in order to entertain a prior
647840	653760	data and likely hypothesis might explain best some behavior within us, it is first necessary to
653760	659200	relax the precision or commitment to prior beliefs, thus enabling new or implausible
659200	668400	hypotheses to explain novel behavior. And here I introduce some things we discussed the other day,
668400	672480	Professor Freiston talk of attenuation of sensory information in relation to
672480	678560	saccades, which is kind of switching off the sensory information we are being aware of,
679200	687680	and that would be the opposite as being impressionable. So I'm quoting Professor Freiston here.
688480	694240	If I can copy, that means I am impressionable. I will accumulate new evidence very quickly.
694240	699280	I have the capacity to assign greater evidence or precision to sensory evidence and suspend
699280	706480	the precision to my prior beliefs. This is something he mentioned in the last
707280	715760	active inference recording, 53.1. And to end this introduction,
716800	721920	one concept we introduced in our paper, which is central to our discussion, is that of zones
721920	727280	of bandwidth surprise. So this is a new concept we introduced to refer to the levels of mismatch
727280	734000	between prior beliefs or top-down predictions and sensory information that species can tolerate.
734640	741440	So first and foremost, the focus of the ZBS concept is on the observers and their ability
741440	748320	to make sense of unobserved innovation. Encoding and subsequent copying of innovation depends
748320	753440	on the degree of disparity or surprise between predictable behaviors, namely,
753440	758640	those typical of the species, and the perceptual incoming information about novel behaviors.
759520	765040	If the ZBS is right, it means that the species can give credit to the information received
765040	771120	through its senses that challenges the prior beliefs. In short, as species can register and
771120	776080	code and potentially reproduce innovative behavior of certain code specifics that
776080	782720	deviate markedly from customary prototypical behaviors. The species is highly impressionable
782720	788960	if we use the words that Professor Friston used the other day. So if the ZBS is narrow,
788960	793920	then a species' ability to change prior beliefs to accommodate new evidence regarding
793920	801840	innovative practices of serving code specifics is compromised. I just want to end up and avoid
801840	806640	any kind of misunderstanding. I want to make clear that our zone of bandwidth surprises have
806640	813680	nothing to do with the zone of Latin solutions by Tenie, albeit we are discussing similar topics.
813680	821520	So the zone of Latin solutions that was introduced by Tenie Kai and Tomo Aselo refers to solutions
821520	827920	to a problem, for instance, extractive foraging that can be achieved by an individual in isolation
827920	833600	during his or her lifetime and hence is not likely to be the product of cumulative culture
833680	839120	involving social learning when observed in the wild. And for those readers interested in this
839120	849360	concept, they can go to the original paper I'm showing here. And also there is a recent paper
849360	858880	by Andrew Whiten, who is Professor in St. Andrews, that discusses this concept and that has replication
858880	864720	by other authors. So it might be a good update for those interested also. And with that, I
864720	873120	finish this short presentation and we can enter this question. Let me stop sharing the screen. Okay, now.
875120	883120	Thank you, Hector. I will bring up the notes again and to Michael, Carl or Dean,
883120	885680	whomever would like to provide a first response, please.
894960	899360	Well, I don't really have a great deal more to add. I think
903280	909920	Hello. Yes, please continue. What's happened here? You're all good, Michael.
910640	917120	We're here, Michael. Hello. Can you hear me? Yes, we hear you continue. Yes, we can. I'm not quite
917120	924880	sure what's happened here. We seem to have snakes and ladders up on the screen. As I said, I don't
924880	931200	think I can add much more to what Hector has just said. I think it makes a very succinct
931840	942720	summary of our paper. And I would like to certainly congratulate Hector for making
943680	951520	what seems to me a very original and perceptive observation that it is the observers whom we
951520	961600	have to thank for the copying and therefore for the handing down of technological achievements by
961600	971280	early humans. Whereas too often the emphasis has been made on the personal responsible for making
971280	978960	a technological innovation. But of course, unless somebody copies that, or at least unless it registers
978960	984720	in the mind of somebody else, it is unlikely ever to get copied. And although this seems to be a fairly
985760	993360	obvious observation, it seems to have escaped most of those who have published on the matter
993360	999600	either too. And I think this is a very original contribution on Hector's part, which deserves
999600	1007680	to be complimented. And really, that's all I wish to say. I think I'd like to throw this open to
1007680	1015600	other people. And if I can illuminate or elucidate any matters, I'm happy to do so. But I think
1015600	1023280	this is really very much to put it mildly Hector's brainchild. And congratulations.
1026080	1031840	Thanks, Michael. You're very kind, but this is our child. And you know a lot. You have a lot to
1031840	1037280	contribute. So I mean, I can only learn school. But thank you anyway.
1040640	1043360	Awesome. Carl or Dean?
1047200	1047920	Go ahead, Carl.
1050800	1060160	Right. So I just wanted to reiterate Michael's admiration for both the idea, but also the very
1060160	1070400	fluent and clear articulation of it. It was nice for me to see that presented so succinctly,
1070400	1077680	because the clarity of the idea is really very evident. It struck me there are sort of two
1078640	1089600	themes that we could discuss, which is the emergence of more complicated solutions to
1089600	1094800	accurately engaging with and modeling our world. I think that was sort of a generic theme in the
1094800	1099040	first part of the presentation. But then very quickly, we moved to this kernel idea, this core
1099040	1111600	idea that the dissemination and the transgenerational propagation that could be read as some kind of
1112480	1118080	cultural niche construction in a sort of evo-devo context depends upon being able to recognize
1118640	1126640	a particular behavior and thereby copy and imitate. I think that was the key thing. And for me,
1126640	1136160	just understanding the mechanics of that from the point of view of belief updating and active
1136160	1148320	inference was, I think, a really useful thing. And as Hector beautifully articulated, the ability
1148800	1157360	to recognize something new and update one's generative model or posterior beliefs depends
1157360	1164000	very sensitively on the confidence or the precision that you've described, the sense of evidence,
1164000	1170640	in relation to the precision with which you hold your prior belief. And I think that's
1170640	1180000	absolutely crucial. And I sort of highlight that issue because it is exactly the same issue
1180720	1186800	that you will find when applying active inference and the free energy principle to
1188160	1192880	psychiatry and the different ways in which we can... I can't remember, Hector, what was your
1192880	1199120	word, misfire, in neither a good nor a bad sense, but certainly there are certain psychiatric
1200080	1205120	syndromes that could be regarded as misfiring. And of course, there's a very close association
1205120	1212560	with innovation and creativity and manic depressive psychosis, famed in terms of various
1212560	1222640	historical figures in the arts. And that, I think, again, brings us back to this key notion
1223440	1230880	of getting that balance, the balance of the precision of our prior constructs,
1230880	1236960	what we have accrued through experience-dependent learning, and the precision-afforded evidence
1236960	1241200	that this is how the world is actually working and how I am actually working, getting that balance
1241200	1247760	right. And that's a really difficult job. And sometimes in computational psychiatry,
1247840	1255040	we try to explain this in terms of a statistician. In order to get the balance right, you have to
1255040	1261520	be able to estimate these precisions in exactly the same spirit that a statistician, when making
1261520	1266880	an inference doing a t-test, has to estimate not just the difference in the group means,
1266880	1271920	but also the standard error. And it's often much more difficult to estimate the standard error
1272800	1278960	than it is to estimate the difference in the group means. And that standard error is the
1278960	1285200	inverse precision. It's the weight that you afford, the meaning, the significance of some
1285200	1292080	quantitative difference, say, a prediction error. So you see this theme that there are two parts to
1292080	1298000	inference. The first order part is just the prediction error or the surprise. But then
1298640	1304160	you have to assign how newsworthy is that. You have to actually modulate that
1304160	1308720	with its precision. So you can multiply by the precision or divide by the standard error
1308720	1315200	to get the actual thing that matters that's going to change your mind. And there's a whole
1315200	1324320	literature on different kinds of people in the context of neurodiversity that have an impairment
1324400	1329520	in being able or possibly have an impairment in being able to estimate that precision. And
1329520	1336400	I'm thinking here of the poster child of this kind of formulation, which is autism. And the idea
1337120	1345120	being that there is an early developmental failure to attenuate sensory precision. So they are
1346080	1356160	early and continually during their early development, severe autism, unable to ignore
1356160	1363600	any of their sensations. And as a consequence, everything is surprising. Everything's arousing.
1363600	1370560	Everything is in danger of revising any beliefs very, very quickly. So they're highly impressionable
1370560	1377120	to the extent they can't build deeply coherent models of their lived world or indeed the other
1377680	1385440	artifacts such as mum that constitutes their world. So I'm just wondering whether a species
1387280	1394720	that has the same kind of latitude in terms of either biasing attention or precision
1394720	1400960	to sensory evidence versus accumulated prior beliefs would display the same kind of misfiring.
1400960	1406480	So you can go from one end and autistic species will be overly impressionable.
1406480	1411440	It'll be too evolvable. It will be able to remember anything from generation to generation.
1412000	1419600	The converse is somebody who you can imagine from a psychiatric perspective
1419760	1426880	has committed unduly to very precise prior beliefs about the world works. And you can think of this
1426880	1432960	in terms of compulsive obsessional disorder or perhaps even depression. The world is an awful
1432960	1439040	place. That is true. Therefore, there's no point in going out and challenging the evidence that the
1439040	1447280	world is an awful place. So I'm just going to stay inside and feel isolated and not move or say very
1447280	1452560	much. So that would be an example of who somebody is not very impressionable. In fact,
1452560	1458320	their pathology, their misfiring prevents them from acquiring any evidence to revise those beliefs.
1458320	1465280	So if you imagine a species that had that same kind of second order misfiring,
1466160	1472320	this is not the misfiring of the innovative soul. This is a failure to infer the second
1472320	1478960	order cystics, the reliability, the precision, the variance, the entropy of the content of the
1478960	1487760	things they try to innovate or make sense of. You're left with this notion of a species that
1487760	1496560	just cannot respond to selective pressures for selectability. They can't respond by adjusting
1496560	1501360	their evolvability simply because they're fixed in their way. So for the environmental,
1501360	1507440	economic changes in any fundamental way, they're not going to be able to respond to that.
1508320	1518560	So I think there are many examples of this key. I think it would be called a pathology in the
1518560	1526080	sense that in a volatile environment, you would need to optimize the precision afforded sensory
1526080	1531120	evidence in order to make the best sense and understand and engage with that environment.
1531120	1536880	And if you get that wrong, there will be a pathology. And I think basically Hector's
1538240	1546560	formulation really drills down and really focuses on the actual mechanism of this kind of pathology.
1546560	1552960	It's all about the transcultural spread of generative models and sense making
1553920	1559120	in terms of engaging either with artifacts or indeed with conspecifics.
1560160	1568080	I repeat, it's such an easy thing to get wrong as evinced in psychiatry. There are so many instances
1568080	1578160	of neurodiversity expressed clinically that I think reflects this singular dimension in terms
1578160	1584640	of the ability to get that balance right. I remember we discussed last time again in terms of
1584640	1590160	impressionability and selection for selectability and the like, the same kind of mechanism unfolding
1591600	1598000	in terms of evolutionary mechanics. But at the level that I think we're talking about today
1598000	1606800	in terms of pursuing plans and novel ways of doing things that may or may not be
1607680	1616240	recognized due to a failure or not of being able to suspend the precision of your priorities.
1616240	1622640	I think that was a central theme. I'll just close with an interesting comment that
1623440	1628960	in terms of the kind of misfiring that Hector was implying, basically a novel way of doing things,
1630400	1635360	being the unique province of those kinds of creatures that can plan possibly deeper into the
1635360	1641760	future. There's a really interesting sort of link back to this precision notion
1642560	1650640	in the sense that if you try to simulate the depth of planning of any sentient artifact,
1652400	1658080	then the degree to which they are able to look into the future depends upon the precision
1658080	1664160	of their beliefs about the succession of contingencies. What will happen if this happens
1664160	1670480	and then what will happen if that happens? It's technically the precision of the transitions
1670480	1676480	amongst worldly states of affairs as you roll out into the future. Again, you have to estimate
1676480	1684320	that precision. There's another point at which precision gets into the game, but in this instance,
1684320	1692000	it's not the precision of the sensory evidence, but the prior precision about the ways things
1692000	1698320	unfold and what will happen if I do that. If you have a low precision there, then you don't
1698320	1702960	hang very far into the future because you lose certainty and confidence very, very quickly
1702960	1710640	after just a few moves. Whereas if you have very precise beliefs about the state transitions and
1710640	1717040	the consequences of various actions or sequential policies, then you can roll out confidently much
1717040	1724320	further into the future and perhaps find that innovative solution. Again, you come back mechanistically
1724320	1735120	to phenotypes that have differing degrees of precision. In this instance, get into the game
1735120	1746720	in terms of bounding the depth of the planning or the temple horizons that you can entertain
1746720	1753760	when scoring different plans in order to actually select the best action at the moment.
1755360	1761440	For me, that insight is really useful because I can see how one could simulate that quite easily
1761440	1769760	in toy situations. Those are my thoughts inspired by Hector's excellent presentation.
1770160	1776960	Thank you, Carl. Dean, what say you?
1779680	1790240	Well, if it's okay, I'd like to step back for a second. Because we were privileged to be able
1790240	1797360	to look at the two papers almost simultaneously, I know chronologically we've split it up into
1797360	1804080	weeks, but as readers we were able to kind of look at both papers side by each. I kind of want
1804080	1810800	to take a bit of a Hofstetter strange loop, two-sided condition, Mobius. We've got all those
1810800	1818080	representations in a lot of our live stream introductions. So if we were to assume that
1818080	1824480	because Carl pointed out not everybody can accommodate a two things at once perspective,
1824800	1831520	if we can assume that that doesn't overwhelm, my question to the authors is, do they see their
1831520	1843200	own journey as a one paper or artifact morphing into the next, or as we were pulled out and taken
1843200	1849120	up by this relationship between epistemic and pragmatic values when uptaking an active inference
1849200	1856400	perspective? That's part one of the question. Part two is the former is kind of a sequential
1856400	1862960	mechanical technical side of things. The latter is the combinatorial plus meaning entailed and
1862960	1872320	entangled. So more where am I relative? So combined, that's a relative depth of field
1872320	1879840	as setting, as establishing, morphing, we want to call it that. As active inference strategy
1879840	1886560	is applied, how do the authors see or potentially see this perspective combining, meaning the
1886560	1893120	sequential end of the combinatorial affecting, not effecting, but affecting what we believe?
1895200	1900640	Because I'm a big believer that we can't just sort of strip the feelings part of this out. I think
1900640	1906880	that's whether we're talking chimpanzees or whether we're talking the emotions of sliding down a snake,
1907680	1912480	those are part of this thing that we're looking at.
1916080	1923040	I'll just give one short note on that. In the paper, Sophisticated Affective Inference,
1923920	1932560	they simulated counterfactual futures, projections about futures, which are in active inference,
1933360	1939600	action oriented. All futures are analyzed and inferred about with respect to policy selection
1939600	1948640	by the agent. And one of the patterns already apparent in even the simple simulations were that
1949120	1957280	even if a very small fraction of counterfactuals have like death as an outcome or highly negative
1957280	1962880	outcomes, it can increase the variance estimator on possible futures greatly,
1963600	1973680	leading to essentially ruminative behavior and affective anxiety around the legitimately warranted
1973760	1981760	variance in possible outcomes. So I see a key piece of this puzzle to be entertaining
1981760	1988080	progressively wider time cones of possible futures in a prospective capacity,
1990000	1997040	and entertaining progressively wider time cones in the past of causal mechanisms
1997440	2012400	and somehow negotiating that affect barometer in the moment as the eye of the needle.
2014640	2022080	Hector and Michael, where do you see affect coming into the snakes and ladders to copy
2022160	2032400	or not to copy set? Well, may I make one or two comments? First of all, in addition to
2033040	2040000	what Professor Fiston has told us about autism and so on, I think it's worth mentioning
2040800	2047200	in the connection of the question that Daniel has just raised to say that there is clearly a
2047200	2056560	difference in the evolution during the life cycle of early humans on the one hand and great apes
2056560	2065200	and probably most human forerunners on the other, the extension of the human life cycle,
2066000	2071120	the extension beyond childhood, and in particular, as I mentioned last time,
2071120	2080240	the adolescent growth spur to which we have, but which may not have existed in early hormone
2080960	2089520	even one and a half million years ago, I'm sure is relevant to making the evolutionary
2090320	2101680	step between, let us say, the surprise that perhaps a chimpanzee has if she
2103280	2110160	observes a dead bird and then regards this as counterintuitive because birds ought not
2110160	2117920	to be lying on the ground, throws it up into the air, but this is an individual spontaneous
2118720	2125440	reaction which is not handed on as part of a behavioral repertoire of the species.
2126880	2135360	And on the other hand, when we begin to see the reproduction of, as it were, counterintuitive
2136320	2144640	behavioral sequences such as taking a lot of flakes repetitively by hand from a piece of stone
2144640	2153360	using another stone to produce an almond-shaped hand axe fairly regularly flaked on both sides,
2154000	2161440	something which is not found before Homo appears in the archaeological and paleoantribological
2161440	2169520	record, but which is not something that seems to be a regular part of human behavior. It is almost
2169520	2178720	as if the individual who made that was doing it as a kind of spontaneous thought of what might
2178720	2186880	happen if I was to do this, part of the deep generation of the hierarchically mechanistic
2186880	2194560	mind which Professor Fiston has told us about, a deep generation that, however, may have been
2194560	2201840	a misfiring, it may have been simply a personal spontaneous event which is not easily
2203120	2212000	recognized by others, particularly if their, shall we say to put it mildly, their mental
2213360	2220720	development is stunted due to the early adulthood and the lack of any adolescence.
2220720	2229200	Adolescence in particular, which and of course the development of the neuronal
2229200	2234800	architecture of the brain which in modern people continues until our mid-20s, if this was not to
2234800	2244160	have occurred, as it does not of course in evening gray tapes, then there would have been perhaps
2244720	2252320	a problem here about the deep generative potential of an individual ever being
2253760	2260400	recognized such that it isn't just what might happen if I was to do this with a piece of stone,
2260400	2266560	but what might happen if I was to copy what that other individual is doing with a piece of stone.
2267520	2275760	And this I think is the stumbling block, this is what has led to the snakes and ladders picture,
2275760	2285920	it is what I think has led to the very slow adaptation of technological, cumulative technological
2288080	2293680	handing down from between generations or between individuals of a generation and between
2293760	2301280	generations and it may well have been the case that it was not until demographical
2303040	2312400	as well of course as paleobiological changes had evolved in the Guinness Homo that there was
2312400	2322640	sufficient intercourse, not merely sexual but social such that these questions continue to be
2323680	2330880	asked ever more frequently and with the appearance of better and ever more fluent communication
2331680	2342160	would allow what we now regard as human culture specifically human nature which
2343280	2352640	I think has differentiated us ever more from the gray tapes. I just, those are my thoughts on the
2352640	2361600	matter. Thank you Michael, Tari or anyone else please.
2365760	2373360	When I just speak to the question about affect and what Michael has just treated us to,
2373440	2386320	so one way of conceiving of affect and valence and the emotional aspects of
2387360	2395840	choosing different plans or making sense of my own bodily sensations is to think a bit in terms of
2396480	2406000	precision estimation. So one way of carving, one way of a very generic way of thinking about some
2406560	2413280	negatively effectively charged states of mind would be those states of mind in which there is
2413280	2422000	irreducible or unresolvable uncertainty. So you know to put simply to be uncertain about what is
2422000	2430640	going to happen to me or what I should do is to be in a state of angst and that can be linked to
2430640	2439440	notions such as anxiety and you know with some extra nuances other feelings such as you know
2440320	2447600	a low affect and indeed if that is pervasive a low mood or or depression but I think the key
2447600	2454400	thing here and indeed many people have developed a calculus of emotion based upon whether your
2454400	2459920	average level of uncertainty is increasing or decreasing or is high and low and adding these
2459920	2465440	things together to get an ontology of emotional states or a purely sort of inference perspective
2465440	2474480	there's another body of thought and literature which links emotions to the literally gut
2474480	2482240	feelings, interception. So that certain emotional states are just hypotheses about the way that I
2482240	2488960	am feeling now that best explain the myriad of extraceptive, intraceptive sensations. So I think
2489520	2497280	there is a mechanics of affect in certainly intraceptive inference and possibly more generally
2497280	2506080	in terms of active inference. However there is another aspect of things that we
2508080	2514880	the feelings that we might associate when we feel compelled to do things and I'm thinking here
2514880	2522400	not about the irreducible or irresolvable uncertainty but about uncertainty that can
2522400	2529520	be resolved. I'm thinking here when Hector mentioned Andy Clark's treatment of surprise
2530240	2541840	there is also the truism that we expect to be surprised and technically that lens that can
2541840	2550240	be explained in terms of the imperatives for choosing those actions that will resolve uncertainty
2550800	2558080	about the way the world works. So this is just an expression of novelty. So if we anticipate
2560160	2566640	that we are going to be surprised by some outcome what we are saying is that that outcome is going
2566640	2573360	to be informative and that it will reduce some uncertainty. Technically it has a high expected
2573360	2580960	information gain. So I'm speaking here as a statistician and using terms that would underlie
2581520	2588960	the Bayesian principles of experimental design that we do these experiments specifically
2588960	2594720	in order to get surprising outcomes that are by definition going to resolve my uncertainty
2594720	2601280	about my different hypotheses. So if we think about the misfires that are innovations
2602240	2610480	these are effectively by definition novel behaviors and there are the fact that people
2611200	2621040	or certain people in certain regions engage in novelty seeking is entirely sensible from
2621040	2627520	the point of view of the free energy principle because novelty seeking just is an expression
2627600	2634160	of curiosity it is just an expression of choosing those outcomes that are going to yield rich
2634160	2641520	information that has technically a high self-information or an expected information gain.
2642080	2650960	So this is another view of the if you like the effective aspect that we do we are compelled
2650960	2657280	and expect ourselves and will possibly explain ourselves as being excited in a positive way
2657280	2663360	at the opportunity to resolve uncertainty because we see an opportunity to do something novel what
2663360	2668720	is behind that door you know what is inside this present you know what would happen if I did that
2668720	2674640	and that's an entirely natural and by natural I mean something that is easily naturalized under
2674640	2681280	the physics of self-organization of any system that has or entails an implicit generative model
2681280	2688400	the consequences of its own action. So I thought it was a lovely link between that kind of
2690720	2702320	affect written into the imperative to seek novelty to seek surprises in the future
2703680	2710000	and what Michael was saying about well yes in order to do that you still have you still have
2710000	2719120	you have to suspend your your prior convictions because if you a priori think you know everything
2719120	2725440	there is no novelty there is no imperative for expiration and you just do the same thing time
2725440	2732240	and time again but if you're in a if you can recognize that there is reducible uncertainty
2732800	2739600	and choose those actions that have the greatest expected expected information gain then you
2739600	2748800	will necessarily succumb to novelty seeking behavior and thereby discover those misfire
2748800	2758320	innovations so and it may be that you know there is well the story that Michael was telling was
2758400	2764480	that we are built to be curious creatures for much longer we are built to you know to be able
2764480	2773520	to respond to novelty and to find those innovative novel ways of behaving and you know so that we
2773520	2782080	remain we were we retain that childlike curiosity as part of our epigenetic neurodevelopmental
2782080	2789360	programming for much longer than other species so I I think that matches very nicely with
2790240	2795760	the sort of the basic thesis that Hector was proposing during the presentation it all comes
2795760	2804960	back to getting the precision of your prior beliefs right and suspending very precise
2804960	2812080	prior beliefs in order to explore hypotheses and that exploration just is in terms of engaging
2812080	2818800	in novel innovative behaviors that moves um that you know will resolve your uncertainty
2820080	2826480	so I if that's right it's sort of engender the question why is there an evolutionary pressure
2827280	2833760	for this kind of eternal childhood so I want to ask Michael and Hector
2834800	2839840	because Michael certainly brought in language and cultural niche construction
2843040	2847840	my guess would be that there will be a circular causality between the
2848640	2857840	the cultural eco niche and the phenotypes that are trying to adapt to that cultural eco niche
2857840	2864400	such that they are required or the phenotypes that have the greatest adaptive fitness are those
2864400	2871920	that retain a greater curiosity in the context of the culture in which they find themselves
2871920	2878240	and part of that will be necessary to actually understand the communication and the signs and
2878240	2884160	the semiotics afforded by their conspecifics which could be read just as language so my question is
2884160	2892720	did this innovative uh does innovative tool use does it emerge um um stochastically or um
2892720	2902560	sort you know um at certain points along with communication and language um or um are they
2903280	2909920	or are they not correlated and if they are correlated in terms of you know um you know
2909920	2915920	historically um what are their thinking about the direction of causality does the fact that you
2916720	2925440	um um remain curious and innovative for much longer um lead to language that we can you know
2925440	2933440	engage in novel communicative behaviors or is it that we need to um remain curious and open-minded
2933440	2940080	in terms of um thinking about or entertaining novel plans and innovative plans simply because we
2940160	2946000	have to make sense of a world that is rich in information because there is language that is
2946000	2951840	that has been culturally inherited or is it both is there is a both top down and bottom up causation
2953840	2962320	so so two questions language tool use and copying and the um the coupling between the
2962320	2969920	sort of evolutionary um phylogetic um sorry the phylogetic on the um the um sort of phenotypic
2970800	2977280	levels when it comes to things like language well um I wonder if I could come in here
2979200	2985840	Daniel is it okay if I address uh calls questions yes in whatever order you like
2985840	2996000	thank you um well in the first place there is a voluminous literature on the relationship between
2996640	3004240	language and the origins of toolmaking and tool use uh really and there's a lot of
3004240	3010960	unresolved argument about whether the two came together very early in human evolution
3010960	3015360	let's say between one million and two million and one and a half million years ago
3016240	3024640	as I originally thought some years ago or whether in fact languages we know it or shall we say
3024640	3031920	fluent communication at least uh only developed much later as I'm coming around to believe now
3031920	3037680	and as Noam Chomsky has said for many many years uh I don't want to get involved in that because
3038240	3045600	really we would need two or three programs and a lot of literature to compare and contrast
3047920	3054400	rather I would query whether we have an eternal childhood
3056160	3060800	on the contrary I think that physiological childhood
3061520	3071120	is slowed down and when the adolescent growth spurt arises after about the age of let's say
3071760	3076640	nine years old uh at sometimes or perhaps somewhat later at others
3078000	3086720	is when we see a major change uh in behavior which is no longer childish but is neither is it
3087680	3093360	adult um of course we needn't go into that we all know that adolescents can be very impetuous
3094720	3101440	but they can also be extremely anxious and this brings us to the angst that uh Carl has mentioned
3101440	3111440	and which I certainly felt uh as an adolescent uh facing the weekly viva voce examinations in human
3111440	3118160	anatomy in the dissecting room which in those days we all had to undergo uh at least in the United
3118160	3124880	Kingdom uh as I can show uh Carl remembers and which always that put me into a state of extreme
3124880	3136320	nervousness and has given me a lifelong worry about the lack of accuracy uh let alone precision
3136320	3144720	in anatomical description and identification uh and a concern um with the statistical
3145600	3153280	variability in uh uh in human anatomy or aspects of it or anatomy in general necessarily human
3153280	3161280	and its relation to uh uh process in other words to physiology and I feel myself much more
3162240	3169360	despite having lectured in human anatomy much more uh aligned to physiology uh and I spent
3169360	3174320	some time doing your physiological stuff you know many many years ago you know I talked to
3174320	3183360	him in Göttingen um then uh in the uh classification this has to be that way uh and as we were taught
3183360	3188800	as medical students all was linked back to about the most obvious rather than the most obscure
3188800	3195760	but we have to have the whole range before us and this brings in the whole um the whole problem of
3196720	3207120	do we think in terms of very uh right or wrong concrete uh facts about stuff in general
3207920	3215280	or do we think in terms of the statistical range of variability whether uh this is uh in terms of
3216240	3224720	occurrences uh let's say related to um Poisson type distributions or to uh uh continuous
3224720	3231440	variants which can be let's say related to um Gaussian type distributions and unfortunately it
3231440	3237920	was only much later in life that I discovered that in fact uh modern statistics allows these two
3237920	3243920	approaches to be uh compared and contrasted in a uniform manner I didn't know that um
3245280	3254000	50 years ago alas uh which shows my my my my ignorance still uh I would come back to the
3254000	3263200	whole business of the growth um curve of of humans that this clearly has altered when we
3263200	3271120	look at chimpanzees and other great apes basically they don't have much of anything approaching
3271120	3277840	our adolescents they don't have this slowing down of growth and then a recuperation of the
3277840	3286800	velocity of growth combined with uh most important not merely anatomical and physiological changes
3286800	3299520	but also uh those of the mind uh the ability to uh innovate the ability to have lateral thinking
3300160	3308880	or the ability um which I have noticed in some um uh young people I've met with an
3308880	3316400	asperger syndrome to be able to concentrate in much great in great detail on particular matters
3316400	3323120	which are extraordinarily arcane such as Sanskrit literature uh in uh people that are not of a
3323120	3332800	South Asian heritage uh whereas uh in dealing with uh other people uh their other colleagues uh
3332800	3344160	they appear to be uh shall we say gauche uh and this is of course well known however and indicates the
3344160	3355040	range of variability but it is the change which we all undergo uh in not merely physical but also
3355840	3362560	intellectual uh ability and inquisitiveness uh which could get us into trouble uh when we are
3362560	3373840	in our adolescence and as young men and women uh given the uh continual and continuous changes in our
3374320	3382720	urinal architecture at least until our mid-20s these days which I think distinguishes and has
3382720	3389920	distinguished the evolution of uh homo sapiens well homo in general and homo sapiens in particular
3389920	3398080	but I wouldn't rule out Neanderthals or even homo erectus and which I think has been cumulative
3398640	3403360	and undoubtedly although we have no idea undoubtedly
3404800	3415920	enhanced by uh increased excuse me and ever ever more complicated uh communication
3418320	3423600	during the the past probably half a million and certainly quarter of a million years
3423600	3432880	this curiosity what would happen if we did this what would happen if we did that um but
3434560	3444560	even so things are not rapidly uh grasped and we see that in different parts of the world
3444560	3448880	particularly in modern populations even that have been long separated from each other
3449760	3456560	not everything is developed at the same rate a couple of well-known examples
3457120	3465360	are for example uh the wheel which first appears probably on the Eurasian steps about 5000 years
3465360	3472480	ago and was used for traction and then appears quite independently in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica
3473200	3479200	um about 2000 years ago and was not used even that would have been very useful
3479200	3484080	but even anything as simple as a wheelbarrow but simply to move around in your images
3485680	3491520	whether they were dolls or toys or gods with no idea and another one taken from the same
3491520	3498720	two areas of the world uh is the metallurgy of copper which appears about well perhaps over
3498720	3506400	6000 years ago in Eurasia and possibly 2000 years ago independently in the new world
3507840	3517520	and yet other things happen too for example in Australia we find modern people were making
3517520	3524880	hand axes when these had long ceased to be made by anybody outside your uh Australia
3524880	3532080	some of them may even be um only a few thousand years old so this
3535120	3542160	appearance and disappearance and reappearance is something which has not gone away and must
3542160	3553920	be related somehow to our ability to to this deep generation of our inquisitiveness our curiosity
3554720	3562880	and indeed our ability um to not to see the most obvious thing around us the desire to see
3564000	3573840	only one simple solution uh this uh which so irritated me when my teachers in the
3574880	3579760	in has a department when I was a medical student believed that there was only one
3580720	3589600	right answer asked how many heads this muscle had or which um how many how many
3590160	3593680	vertebrae there were and this and all that part of the vertebral column
3594320	3599680	that alone in the skull and we know how very variable these matters can be so
3601760	3608320	there is this tension between the desire for things to be seen in one light only
3608880	3618800	in a one-dimensional way and our natural inquisitiveness this deep deeply generated
3619840	3627760	desire to say what would happen if it was like this how is it how has it come to be like that
3628560	3635760	why is everything different and not the same I can't put it any other way with that I've said
3635760	3640880	of course you know thank you Michael Dean
3643520	3650880	thanks Daniel um so again this is for the authors this this has been really helpful to me
3650880	3660320	as observers because that's that's highlighted um very clearly in the papers I see both papers um
3661280	3664880	speaking to something that I would describe as condition set meaning
3665520	3673360	in the papers examples limit the game to the game metaphor at least to this type where there's
3673360	3681680	a limited number of tiles and a and a clear continuation until a conclusion or recognize
3681680	3689920	the limit of the species to not cracking so there there's a there's a real clear idea and Michael's
3689920	3698080	and Hector both spoken to so what was the what was the growth limit of the of the
3698720	3704480	brain's capacity etc well I'm curious about and I and I don't know if there's a Michael or Hector
3705280	3713520	have a a real clear answer to this but I'm wondering what and when was the
3713760	3723920	the was maybe the range of time that we see the unlocking or or or sort of combinatorial
3723920	3731920	explosion or not but what I guess what I'm asking is is is there a move that we can
3731920	3738720	clearly see as being something that differentiates playing which we know happens in a lot of species
3738720	3744880	and gaming because as I said at the end of 53.1 I wondered if it was going to be game on
3745920	3751440	and so I'm I'm curious what the authors think about that is there a difference between playing
3751440	3761440	and gaming meaning that there's now an actual introduction of strategy in this um so maybe
3761440	3768400	another way of asking it is there a moment when you guys can point to it and say this was kind of
3768880	3778400	when we saw a a reducing or maybe a relaxing of a of a limit forward world
3781840	3788880	I wonder whether in fact this difference is really quite as great as Dean suggests
3788880	3799760	and whether it may be have something to do with the ability in working memory and other aspects
3799760	3816080	of memory in dealing with or in developing a logical mathematical ability to plan or in planning
3816640	3826800	and in communicating disability such that the planning is no longer at an on an individual
3826800	3836480	level but is participatory and therefore again in other words and perhaps Hector can answer
3836480	3846080	this question but I would suggest that this developed slowly gradually and by no means
3846080	3855280	in a continual let alone a continuous manner in Homo but not in earlier in a way it did not in
3855280	3863200	earlier and other hominid species do we see and this I would ask Hector do we really see
3863920	3871840	um let's just say uh well chimpanzees or other great apes developing the kind of
3872480	3877680	logical math ability to make very very simple combinatorial
3881600	3891600	associations between objects or behavioral activities and developing this into a communal game
3893200	3900480	which involves other individuals in the group because as Hector has remarked on various occasions
3900480	3908720	and informed me when we see things like nut fat in small groups of chimpanzees by no means
3909760	3919040	is copied by all of them let alone copied or emulated by all of them but and by no means
3919040	3926480	even when it is with faithful accuracy and precision in the manual operations that are
3926480	3936080	required so that I would ask Hector do we see these associations being transformed into games
3936400	3942560	okay that's a tricky question um
3944640	3951200	I mean what we know with chimpanzees is that they have promised to do these second organ
3951200	3959040	relationships which is like hierarchical um ordering of for instance if I have a set of
3959040	3966400	objects I can classify them attending to the color for instance chimps could do that okay if
3966400	3972560	only color is involved but I can classify them by color and shape so this is another order of
3972560	3980480	of hierarchy so I can pick things that are square and red and put them together so this ability to
3980560	3989520	abstract um a kind of ordering category so that I have relations of relations like in
3989520	3997600	analogical reasoning when I I can focus on one dimension or in another simultaneously so I can
3998240	4002720	shift my focus from one dimension to another in order to classify things this I think it's
4003520	4010400	quite human like for instance the Wisconsin card sorting test so I can shift from one dimension
4010400	4016720	to another to classify objects or cards and this is something that chimps would have more
4016720	4023520	problems to do so they might classify in a first order categories like I put things that have a
4023520	4030000	same color they could learn to do that that wouldn't be a big problem but I guess they have to use
4030000	4035760	two dimensions together to classify objects that we have more problems because this involves
4035760	4041840	considering more one that more than one dimension simultaneously I'm not sure I'm making sense here
4041840	4050720	this is the the Jonas Langer work that he did with with kids and that's a remarkable work that
4050720	4057680	Jonas Langer did and then there were these people in Rome I think it was Poti at the lab of
4058240	4066960	um Biopark and Rome that replicated that with um with chimpanzees uh I think it was a spinosci
4066960	4072640	who replicated it and found that chimpanzees were more compromised in order to have this kind of
4073360	4079920	classificatory relations of relations so and I think that's a very very remarkable ability that
4079920	4085120	that uh that we develop so I don't know if I answered your question Michael
4087840	4100960	perhaps that comparison of two dimensions color and shape and then the snakes and
4100960	4112880	ladders overlay that lets us take the hypotenuse is that abductive jump enabled developmentally
4112880	4118160	and neuro epigenetically by all of these different features which happen over much slower
4118160	4126880	timescales especially considering the actual millisecond timescale associated with recognition
4126880	4134400	those other changes are so much slower but the ability to move diagonally on the grid
4134800	4141760	through the rows and the columns and turn that into movement on a manifold
4143360	4150960	is the ability looked at from the either row or column perspective to move in both at once
4151760	4160000	but by condensing those two dimensions into one there can be new kinds of cognitive movements
4160800	4171280	and then applying that cognitivist lens also evolutionary transitions even without the complex
4172240	4181600	cumulative feedback with the eco-cultural niche merely in the um abductive moment
4182320	4189840	and just one other piece I wanted to return to is that every variable can have a precision
4189840	4196240	estimator or not in the generative models and active inference every variable can be fixed
4196880	4202880	and so the model can just be persistently surprised with no updating or one can have any
4202880	4210320	kind of prior or hyper prior and so on and that enables learning and that's what enables not just
4210320	4217360	estimation of the mean or the center of gravity the expectation of but also the variance the whole
4217360	4228320	distribution and then it's um by applying that kind of precision on everything view which as
4229280	4235040	Michael brought up is exactly what modern statistics does you can't do
4236000	4239760	inference with a t-test unless you have the mean and the variance
4241920	4245520	we won't go into any more details on the statistics but every variable has the
4245520	4251280	center of gravity mean estimator and the variance estimator and so we talked about precision on
4251280	4256960	sensory information the mapping between observations and hidden state estimates
4258160	4262880	and then also there's this action oriented precision on how things will unfold
4263840	4270880	and you might be able to update your precision on sensory evidence by seeing something different
4273280	4282880	but updating your precision on how things will unfold is oriented around taking actions
4293120	4295120	and
4299280	4305840	Daniel you must have some questions I can't be the only one floating questions and having my
4305840	4308240	zone of bound and surprise of being expanded here
4311920	4318400	I I have um questions I can ask you a question or Michael or Hector or Carl please feel free
4319120	4326960	if you're only I would like to pick up with something that professor please don't mention
4326960	4334640	before and that was kind of it was intriguing because it is true that some great artists like
4334640	4342640	Van Gogh and others were very creative and also I don't know if it's appropriate to say
4342640	4347200	that they were in the verge of psychosis I don't know if it's appropriate because I
4347200	4356960	don't have any statistics but I'm thinking if being innovative is this again is misfiring so I
4356960	4364720	would like to separate two things one is how innovative you are and I'm thinking in the
4364720	4370640	economy if you are well adapted to an environment it's not a good idea that you try different
4370640	4376080	things all the time because imagine that you have some place where there are nice berries
4376080	4381760	you have discovered a safe path to that place and if you keep to that path you go to the berries
4381760	4387600	you get there you feed so that's good for you imagine you want to try something new so you
4387600	4394240	are very innovative and one day you decide to try another path to the berries a shortcut so you have
4394240	4400160	one risk that you can face new dangers because this path is new you don't know what is waiting for
4400240	4406000	you there the other is you face it that you can get lost and then you could spend the energy you
4406000	4413280	need to survive so in a way I don't think that being innovative is good in itself but we have
4413280	4419760	the risk if we are too conservative that the environment changes and if the environment changes
4419760	4425760	significantly we are not well adapted because we don't have alternative behaviors that are
4425760	4432720	adaptive to the new environment so I guess with this happens like psychological traits
4432720	4440000	nobody has extremes so we don't have people with extreme psychological personalities I mean
4440000	4446160	we have pathologies but the selection has favored kind of intermediate levels so I guess
4446880	4451280	and Professor Friston can correct me on this he knows more about psychopathology
4451280	4456880	but I guess it happens with innovation that we need some kind of balance and
4458480	4465520	what this is doing for me is how humans escape that balance in terms of how they
4465520	4473520	manage to be creative and innovative at times because we are very good we repeat many routines
4473520	4481040	so but still we can be very creative and we have selected so we have been successful in
4481280	4488000	up to our recognition and I'm just thinking in this counterfactual idea so I think this
4488000	4493520	might have played a major role the ability to have counterfactuals because perhaps
4494320	4501520	instead of risking my life every time I innovate I can rehearse what will happen and as Professor
4501520	4507680	Friston mentioned before if I have a good precision I can imagine things that will unfold
4507680	4517680	if the genetic model is very deep I can think ahead many steps and see how I will fare in the
4517680	4523120	future so I can kind of rehearse things in my head before I put them into practice in the real
4523120	4532320	world and this might help me to be innovative but with a kind of bounded risk or controlled risk
4532320	4535760	I don't know if this makes sense but I think it must be some kind of balance between
4536640	4540800	if I can rehearse things in my head I'm very good and predicting things that will
4543200	4552400	evolve or unfold many steps ahead I can see how I will fare and then I can risk to be
4552400	4557840	innovative I don't know I mean I'm very I'm being very speculative here okay so I just want to
4557840	4560480	make clear that I'm being very speculative
4564080	4572960	please Cara yeah no I'd like to speak to that yeah I don't yes you may be speculating but I think
4572960	4579280	those those observations are very very little and very and very useful I mean you've brought a
4579280	4585120	number of fundamental issues to the table first of all the importance of being able to plan
4586080	4590960	to have a generative model of the consequences of actions is not the gift of all species and
4590960	4596880	and in some instances in your words when the environment doesn't change you that would be
4596880	4602480	an undue complexity cost to carry around a brain with a generative model of the consequences of
4602480	4607440	my actions if I don't need it if I was a virus or an insect I wouldn't I wouldn't need that it would
4607520	4616800	be it would be very inefficient and so that sort of lens brings you to a picture that our world
4617520	4627040	is sufficiently complex and changing at pace the committing to very simple underly expressive
4627040	4632640	generative models is not an option and one really important way of making the more expressive is to
4632720	4637520	increase that temporal horizon or temporal depth so that we can you know in accord with things like
4637520	4644400	simulation theory roll out into the future and and now become the kind of phenotypes that can
4644400	4650960	select among a number of plausible policies and you know I think that would be one bright line
4650960	4655840	between lots of you know different genres and different species you know that could be just
4656400	4663520	drawn on a dimension which is just the depth of planning that my generative model will support
4664880	4671920	and we've talked previously about that being constrained by the precision afforded in a given
4671920	4678400	context my beliefs about how I would roll out into the future so I think that's just you know
4678400	4684000	from the from my perspective at least that's a really important observation that the depth of
4684000	4689520	planning is a very important functional characteristic of the generative models
4690080	4696960	that are implicit in phenotypic behavior and possibly in terms of what what kinds of models
4696960	4703520	are subject to selective pressure at an evolutionary or indeed at you know an eva diva at an eva diva
4704560	4712240	level and the other the other I think key insight that you bring to the table here
4712720	4722240	relates to what affords the right balance between novelty seeking exploratory behavior
4723440	4732480	and the risks that that would entail and I think you know that from a purely sort of mathematical
4732480	4739120	point of view is a really important observation just to sort of join the dots with other ways
4739360	4746240	of understanding how the universe works that particular question is very
4746240	4752080	usefully framed in terms of constraints so the free energy principle that from which active
4752080	4760640	inference inherits is one way of or is dual to something called the maximum entropy principle
4760640	4769040	under constraints so this was brought to physics in the 20th century by a foundational thinker
4769040	4775520	et james who basically rewrote physics in terms of probability theory and said that basically
4775520	4785440	everything of interest at least or physically conforms to a constrained maximum entropy principle
4785440	4791120	so that actually is just an expression or form
4793760	4798080	for 10s the free energy principle in the sense that the constraints
4799520	4805120	in from the point of view of free energy principle are just what is brought to the table by a
4805120	4813120	generative model and the entropy pertains to the entropy of belief so you've got this
4813920	4821760	this dialectic simply at the level of the physics of measurement and inference
4822320	4827200	which means that I'm always trying to explain any measurement
4828160	4834960	in such that my predictions are as accurate as possible but at the same time
4835920	4842000	leaving having the maximum of the attitude so that I don't over commit in accord with
4842000	4847280	Occam's principle so mathematically what that means is the entropy of my beliefs has to be as
4847280	4854720	big as possible provided I provide provided I have an accurate given the constraint that my
4854720	4860480	account on my measurement has to be an accurate measurement so that that may sound if you like
4860480	4867280	completely unconnected to whether I choose to wander away from the very path and but in fact
4867280	4873920	exactly the same maths applies to these quantities either the constrained entropy
4873920	4882080	or the variational free energy in the future and what happens is you get exactly the same dialectic
4882080	4889600	you have two pressures on one hand to comply with Occam's principle or Occam's razor
4889680	4891200	and on the other hand to
4894880	4903840	to keep all your options open which in a sense is exactly do I comply with the constraints
4905440	4910080	that I know I'm going to get my barriers and I'm not going to be eating my myself by a predator
4910080	4916560	or do I keep my options open and try that other path so this this so dialectic is just baited
4916560	4923680	into the physics of any self-organizing system and practically you know it emerges in a number
4923680	4931600	of ways one way of writing down the free energy or the constrained entropy from James's point of
4931600	4939360	view expected given a particular policy do I go down this path or that path is in terms of ambiguity
4939360	4945680	and risk to you're using exactly your words you know so the risk is just the relative entropy on
4945680	4951920	the divergence or discrepancy between what I think will happen and what I expect to happen to me
4951920	4957200	so I expect not to be eaten and that's the key constraint at hand here there's not about rewards
4957200	4962960	anymore we're throwing away the notion of rewards and we're now replacing it with a multi-dimensional
4962960	4969040	construct which is all the constraints in the ways of being like having a certain temperature or not
4969040	4974240	being very cold or very hot not being eaten not being dead just keeping within my characteristic
4974320	4979920	states so you write down those characteristics states in terms of constraints and those constraints
4979920	4986800	basically preclude certain states of being and then I just compare well what will my states be
4986800	4996400	if I do this and how far away from how far away is that anticipation from my prior constraints
4996400	5002000	and that literally is called risk it's the KL divergence between your policy dependent
5002960	5006960	predictive posterior and your prior preferences that have the constraints
5006960	5014160	the other thing is the ambiguity and that simply reduces to making sure that you make moves in a
5014160	5027200	way that underwrites an unambiguous precise mapping between what you see and what caused your
5027200	5033040	sensation so you avoid dark rooms basically you avoid the dark you avoid dark alleys you don't go
5033920	5038800	where you can't see what's happening so that's the ambiguity so together the expected free
5038800	5047680	energy is equal to risk plus ambiguity and when read like that then the balance between
5048400	5054240	the risk and the ambiguity or another way of carving this up is in terms of expected information
5054240	5062960	gain and expected cost or its complement expected value where the value is just how to what degree
5062960	5075040	am I complying with my constraints is enables you to to now write down the balance that resolves
5075040	5080960	to a certain extent dissolves that dialectic by the precision of your prior preferences your
5080960	5089360	constraints so if you're the kind of creature or child or insect that has very precise beliefs
5089360	5095920	about the kinds of outcomes I expect to anticipate and I may have very precise beliefs about my body
5095920	5101760	temperature for example but I may have very less precise beliefs about where I am in terms of latitude
5101760	5107440	I could be in Alabama I could be in Newcastle London I can still be me but I can't be minus
5108160	5112960	your minus two degrees centigrade and still be me so some constraints are very precisely
5112960	5119040	specified and other constraints are less precisely specified so the risk is you know
5120560	5129840	is determined by the precision of your prior beliefs about your characteristic states the
5129840	5134400	precision of the constraints you bring to the table as a phenotype and some people will be innate
5134400	5141280	and completely sub-personal it's wired into your home ostensis and some will be learnable some may
5141280	5147440	even be sort of oppositional you know we can talk about them but whatever they have to be that
5147440	5152720	because they define basically what kind of thing you think you are and how you act accordingly
5152720	5160400	so the balance between the you know whether to go down another path as opposed to the berry path
5160960	5167280	is going to depend upon this particular creature of phenotype and specifically the precision of
5167280	5176880	their prior preferences in terms of what outcomes they would a priori entertain and if they have very
5176880	5184240	very precise preferences of not being eaten and there's even a marginal small probability of being
5184240	5190080	eaten if they stray from the current path then they won't explore if on the other hand they
5190080	5199040	have a slightly more liberal expectation about being about the encounters with the predator for
5199040	5208320	example and then there will be more there will be more likely to engage in novelty seeking and
5208320	5215680	exploratory behavior so you know perhaps put this even more simply you know that this is the
5215760	5222640	exploration exploitation dilemma written in terms of the physics of self-organization under
5222640	5231120	planning and you know and it all reduces again to precision and in this instance it's the precision
5231120	5239040	of the constraints that are articulated as the your prior preferences your characteristic states
5239040	5246880	your the kinds of states that you know you are you believe characterize you that if you stray from
5246880	5254800	you cease to be you cease to exist basically so I thought I was I thought you know that's I don't
5254800	5260320	think what you said was speculation I think they're all fundamentals of behavior and actually
5260560	5268160	um from an ecological perspective you know they speak to the heart of the of choice behavior
5269120	5275760	and you know why we do the things we do and why it is always in the background the game
5275760	5284000	of saying do I explore or do I play it safe awesome thank you Carl Dean
5284000	5289200	I think you'd muted Daniel oh thank you thank you Carl go ahead Dean
5290880	5294000	I just like to run with what Carl was saying
5297200	5300240	this is mostly for Hector and Michael um
5302400	5308720	here's a here's a here's a case in point all the collective wisdom on the side of a volcano
5308720	5316000	can suddenly be arrested and yet there is still a Pompeii today I wonder what you gentlemen think
5316000	5320320	that says about certain species zone of founded surprise
5320720	5342720	Dean does this refer to the material the fixed materiality alone of the ruins of Pompeii
5342720	5347680	of which no more will ever exist in the
5350080	5354800	archaeological context being able to be unpacked into this collective wisdom
5356000	5362000	I'm just curious because we are talking about regular irregularities and regular irregularities
5362000	5370880	these these seismic events occur in the timeline and I'm just curious what we think then as we
5370880	5378000	reflect on that and still adopt that kind of risk mindset as I said I just want to run with what
5378640	5385920	Carl was was suggesting and I don't know that I don't know that there's an equivalent I don't
5385920	5395120	know if I if I if chimpanzees would do what humans have done like see the evidence and still
5395760	5403760	you know park themselves right in the path of of danger I'm just curious what they think about that
5404320	5407360	in terms of the timeline aspect of this
5418880	5422000	Hector or Michael go ahead
5422000	5426000	I don't think you're muted now Hector
5430160	5431200	sorry my microsoft
5434000	5439040	so it's a kind of difficult question Dean I'm not sure if I understood correctly
5440080	5447360	but as you're referring to the zone of founded surprise and linking what what Professor Christon
5447360	5454800	said before if I'm to take any road which is I don't know what awaits for me there okay
5455920	5465120	but if I'm very good at making guesses or inferring what might happen based on information I have
5465120	5473360	gathered before so I'm good at anticipating what might unfold okay because I have this complex
5473360	5478000	machinery let's call it working memory which is a construct I have a powerful working memories
5478000	5484320	for I have entertained many possibilities and there is something that kind of
5486320	5495040	ring bell when Professor Christon was talking of precision which is the concept of metacognition
5496000	5505360	so metacognition refers to thinking about my own thinking right so I and you have to clear
5506880	5515920	to clear aspects one is how sure am I about my knowledge for instance I'm sure I know
5517280	5523440	something even when I cannot remember this is the tip of the tongue effect so I can be
5523440	5530480	or I can give you an answer and be 100% sure this answer is correct I can be 80% sure 50%
5530480	5538080	sure so I can evaluate how much sure I am about something okay so this I think it looks a bit
5538080	5545680	like precision so if I make some expect plans and I think one might unfold I can be very sure
5545680	5551520	this will happen or not and this probably has to do with my metacognition so how sure I am
5551520	5556320	about what will happen and that might help me to decide whether I go or not
5559120	5567920	and coming back to your son of under surprise I'm not sure if I'm digressing but perhaps I can
5567920	5576880	preempt the surprise if I have a good precision or good metacognition so if I'm sure that I can
5576880	5584480	rehearse things in my head and see how they will unfold they won't be that surprising later
5584480	5591840	so I'm just speculating perhaps this ability to have counterfactuals to have this kind of
5591840	5600240	rehearsing in my head and this depth of generative models can be empty surprise and here I'm
5600240	5606400	speculating clearly so I don't know if I answer your question about Pompeii because I'm not sure
5606400	5614400	they understood but just bring some some ideas that might be useful but again they are speculative
5618960	5625840	it'd be nice just to link that notion of metacognition and having beliefs about beliefs
5625840	5631440	you know the precision of a belief about the likelihood of being eaten by a predator
5631760	5638800	I think that's what Daniel was speaking to before when he was talking about the hierarchical depth
5638800	5646080	of models and their increasing complexification one really important way of making a model more
5646080	5652560	expressive and context sensitive is to induce a hierarchy of exactly the sort that Hector was
5652560	5658960	talking about in terms of this metacognitive aspect but not just content but crucially again
5659040	5668320	coming back to the confidence and the precision I think that's a really central concept and I
5668320	5680000	was just thinking you know if you had to commit to what kinds of epigenetically specified constraints
5680960	5688560	you would associate with the genome what in what space would they live
5689760	5694880	and my guess is that most of it is about the constraints and within that it's going to be
5694880	5702800	the constraints on the precisions that there are certain sort of innate ranges of outcomes that I
5702800	5711280	will entertain and in in principle at least you can actually just write down an entire
5711280	5718640	generative model in terms of constraints and in terms of precisions in the sense that if the
5718640	5726080	generative model is universally expressive and everything goes then you can sort of carve out
5726080	5737040	an apt structural form for that generative model despite shrinking some of or 99.9% of this overly
5737040	5745360	expressive generative model to zero with very very precise constraints so well perhaps I'll
5745360	5754560	turn this into a question if you were trying to simulate artificial life in its most generic sense
5754560	5760480	if you're trying to simulate tool use for example the emergence of tool use in a synthetic
5760480	5769440	population and you had to actually write down what could be asked via genetically or epigenetically
5769440	5774240	to each subsequent generation what what kinds of things would you specify
5785520	5790080	that's kind of my question in the same in the same sense how do we
5792240	5797520	where where do we draw those arbitrary lines I mean it's this it's the thing that comes up again
5797520	5804960	and again as we continue to sort of see the next the next sedimentary layer of papers discussing
5804960	5812800	this right but the but the fact that it can be moving and the fact that it it isn't there is
5812880	5818000	a rate constant that you mentioned in the last live stream that has to be
5820480	5826560	working functioning and effective and then there's still this question of so
5828480	5835760	so what is our our but what are we attending to and what are we still available to all at once
5835760	5844160	and how do we organize that in a way that it most closely as you say precisely if that that's
5844160	5853120	the best way to describing it what's really going on and that that's that that seems to me at least
5853120	5864880	to be a moving target just one quick speculative mapping as well first the um instead of just
5864880	5873600	stacking bricks with content on content on content intercalating layers of content estimation
5873600	5880080	with metacognitive estimation is what allows the extendability of the multi-layer predictive
5880080	5886880	processing type architectures it's actually like the back and forth or the interplay between
5887760	5895200	the content estimators and the variance estimators that allows that model to
5896400	5902720	not just be described in terms of its center of gravity but also in terms of its full distribution
5902720	5909600	and then to Carl's question about what is being passed down genetically and epigenetically
5909600	5916560	and thinking about those terms even generically like in the context of perhaps source code
5916560	5924240	and a configuration file or some other mapping of like what is inscribed from a classical information
5924240	5933200	genetic perspective and then what is contextually and more rapidly transmitted there's an interesting
5933200	5940800	angle I could see it this way or potentially the opposite but there's a shorter term epigenetic
5940800	5952880	firing rate and then a slower updating of neuromodulatory like genetic possibilities
5952880	5960480	kind of opening and closing valves over a slower timescale and then of course these are nested
5960480	5965920	within another one so what is what is neuromodulatory this can also itself be a firing rate in other
5965920	5975440	ways but just focusing on this direction the inscribed constraints are like the width of the
5975440	5984000	aperture and then the actual flow of the photons through the lens is an instantaneous firing rate
5984000	5992880	that's happening way faster than the aperture can be dilated or not and so merely the fact that there
5992880	6000400	are multiple concurrent timescales and the associated interplay of their rate constants
6001040	6011040	tells us a lot about this kind of learning architecture what we do without understanding
6011600	6020320	is the action question and related to our preferences and precision however it seems
6021120	6031120	pretty key that to alternate estimates about content with metacognitive type estimates
6031120	6039680	and to package that set of two belief distributions mean and variance to package those also as one
6040480	6044320	so it can be handled as a composite one
6054480	6061680	and just to point out that learning rates are the manifestation of that second order
6061680	6070800	specification that precision so they are the same thing at every timescale
6071680	6079200	so you could articulate the developmental stages for example the
6079360	6089440	rejuvenation but certainly the changes say in late adolescent
6090880	6098480	as a programmed learning rate or learnability that can be read at some level as a precision
6098480	6103920	because the precision is just the rate constants that link the state to the rate of change of the
6103920	6110960	state and that basically is just a learning rate at many many different levels so I think it was a
6110960	6117760	sort of uniform way of putting together these different notions some useful notions here
6121280	6128320	from machine learning are sort of the notion of learning to infer you know so I was just
6128320	6132880	thinking about my an answer to my own question and clearly you can't write down a generative model
6132880	6138560	that's going to be able to get up and go to school in the morning all you can do is to
6139680	6148080	create a self-organizing blob that has exactly the right learning rates so that it is has exactly
6148080	6152960	the right learnability so that it can acquire a generative model and learn through experience
6152960	6159680	dependent plasticity that model of its little lived world of course that little lived world
6159680	6166960	has been constructed by other grown-up babies so you know we get back to this circular
6166960	6173120	causality that evolution is trying to provide you with the right ability learning rates,
6173120	6180880	precisions and structural constraints on your generative model but your generative models
6180880	6184560	from the evolutionist point of view are actually creating the environment that has to be learned
6185200	6190160	so there's to my mind isn't there's you know a very beautiful circular causality here
6190720	6197200	that you know as fast as you're learning you're actually creating new worlds in which to learn
6197920	6202160	you know I guess we're seeing that at the moment with the advances in technology and the like
6204960	6210000	which brings me back to my question about the sort of the top-down versus bottom-up causation
6210640	6217360	about you know what is a good model of this world what is a good phenotype?
6217360	6239920	in our final 15 minutes or so here how do we move beyond the 53.2 either to the authors
6240800	6251280	their directions and excitements about the work or anyone's exhortations or
6252960	6266480	raising of possibilities for other ways it can be developed
6270880	6279280	I wonder if it's worth bearing in mind that
6283440	6289600	increasing technological not necessarily complexity but at least variability
6289920	6300560	may well have permitted a reduction in selection pressure on the
6302800	6312880	phenotype and evidently affecting both the genotype and epigenetic
6313600	6322400	variability I see this because I would like to draw attention to the the graph which I
6323120	6330080	presented last week which was taken from Professor Philip Tabars's work on early humans
6331600	6339280	showing an increasing range of variation in the cranial capacity of
6340080	6349200	bipedal hominids from the osteopathy signs through to homo sapiens suggesting a reduction
6351040	6360720	in selection pressure for particular well for the size of the brain basically
6361120	6373600	I find it hard not to relate this to the advantages that slowly accrued to
6377280	6384320	tool use and thereby of course the variability and variation of tool making
6384640	6393360	thereby reducing the risk or some of the risks existential risks
6396880	6407120	that otherwise plague or have plagued other hominins whether extant whether the ancestors
6407120	6416800	of extant great apes or indeed the earlier forms of bipedal hominin and osteopathy signs
6416800	6427040	palanthropus canianthopus etc well who knows but it's perhaps
6427120	6439280	um not totally irrelevant that this variability has grown over the past couple of million years
6439840	6443680	and is now very wide as I mentioned last week
6443680	6456080	this I think is in contradiction to the the way in which
6457600	6467040	selection pressures have been highly discriminatory in for example producing let's say the wide range
6467040	6472400	of Darwin's famous Galapagos finches yeah just to give a well-known example
6477280	6487280	thank you Carl can I ask um coming back to this theme of um selection for selectability
6487360	6498400	um and the notion of precision or learning rates cast in terms of mutation rates so
6498400	6503840	you're my favorite example of and I'm sure there are better ones nowadays when I was reading around
6503840	6511760	this subject my favorite example was um the story told by Ernst Merer about Drosophila fruit flies
6511840	6518480	being reared in volatile versus non-volatile environments so you're rearing generation after
6518480	6525360	generation at a fairly fixed temperature and then an equivalent set of generations where they've
6525360	6532240	varied the temperature um you're a few degrees plus and minus um and what they showed was that the
6532240	6538800	mutation rate of the Drosophila in the volatile changing environment
6539040	6546560	was greater than the mutation rate the genetic mutation rate in the less volatile population or
6546560	6552240	transgenerational populations which I thought was a beautiful example of selection for selectability
6552240	6560000	itself that you know that increased variation um certainly or it's you know a phenotypic
6560000	6567440	expression of implicit increased genomic variability was itself an adaptive response to
6567840	6574080	the rate of change of the environment so my question is is there a similar sort of picture
6574080	6585680	or view of um variation in um either phenotypic or genetic um characteristics in um over a longer
6585680	6594480	time scale in in sort of um human evolution uh and if there is is there any evidence um
6595040	6598720	that there's go that there is in the past century or so um
6600560	6605600	perhaps this is a bit of an ambitious uh ask but uh is there any evidence that the
6606640	6612480	there has been a sort of phase transition in the variability and the evolvability and the
6612480	6629360	associated um phenotypic variation the empirical or an empirical research agenda would be to make
6629920	6635840	a hierarchical active inference model and perform dynamic causal modeling on different
6635840	6644880	variability characters across levels of phenotypic and genotypic integration and have that model
6646880	6654800	in use but a very provocative and interesting question Carl
6655040	6666320	and to what extent is it happening with our cellular architecture and to what
6666320	6675360	extents are these processes happening with our niche given these unique cumulative cultural
6676000	6681920	generative model generative process thinking through other minds increasingly the production
6681920	6692960	of artifacts that enable not just offloading but outsourcing these do represent unique cognitive
6692960	6705040	niches and so it will be quite interesting to investigate perhaps if we each want to have
6705040	6716800	some closing round thoughts perhaps dean with the first word thank you because you know I hate
6716800	6723920	having the last one I'm just curious gentlemen thank you first again for for your generosity
6724560	6730400	I'm just curious now that you've dipped your toes in this this active inference institute
6730400	6737200	live stream world what are your what are your impressions is was it was it it was it helpful at
6737200	6757840	all who is next you okay so I think that's been very useful and mostly very I mean I've enjoyed
6757840	6765440	a lot to have this discussion with all of you so it's been very enjoyable and just for the future
6767680	6774400	I'm just wondering if there is such a thing like preempting surprise based on these counterfactuals
6774400	6780000	I guess maybe it's already written and discussed and it's all clear but I wonder that this might be
6780000	6788240	an interesting idea to explore if I can preempt to surprise before I act I mean for even acting but
6788240	6795600	that's kind of maybe that's resolved already anyway it has been fun thank you all honestly
6799840	6805200	thank you that makes me think about saying I don't mean to surprise you but that's actually
6805280	6811280	going to increase it's like oh boy has someone been injured but what is the show not tell
6813040	6822080	of preempting surprise so that with a linear string in time there is the path from the old
6822080	6831360	berry patch to the new berry patch such that it appears to be within a nested hierarchical model
6831360	6840320	the path of least action to follow though in a less nested model it would be quite surprising
6847360	6858480	Michael or Carl your kind of closing thoughts or questions as we bring this set of 53 to a close
6858800	6864640	well I'll let Michael have the last word and
6866640	6873120	what you just said in Hector's comment I think there's a lot of interest in that in that notion
6873120	6879920	you know sort of trying to preempt surprise I mean a simple reading of risk minimization
6879920	6885760	you're just basically not engaging in policies that are going to result in surprising outcomes
6885760	6893120	where surprise is just the violation of prior preferences and so at that level I think that's
6893120	6902000	that sort of almost a truism but there is an interesting there's an interesting sort of
6902000	6908240	implication of that which leads to notions of the way that we choose to behave epistemically
6908240	6915760	in terms of avoiding information that would be very surprising sometimes articulate in terms of
6915760	6921440	optimism bias sometimes in terms of wishful thinking but the kind of paradox that you get
6922000	6928320	when we are Bayes optimal creatures and yet we don't want to open the letter from the GP giving
6928320	6934720	us our most recent cancer results or we don't want to open that letter whether we fail to get
6934720	6941600	that job or pass that exam or indeed the anatomy dissection survivor and there are certain things
6941600	6948000	that we avoid there are certain surprises that we avoid or split another way there are certain ways
6948000	6956400	of preempting surprise by avoiding knowing stuff that we might find surprising and that's an emerging
6956400	6961600	literature now which takes you a little bit outside your comfort zone but it's a fascinating
6961600	6967200	literature because you'll find things like trends in cognitive science and and the like
6967200	6972400	in answer to Dean's question about these sessions because this is not my first session so but
6974240	6982160	but this does exemplify it yeah it's for fun and we're amongst friends and indulging ourselves
6982160	6988160	and those people who care to listen to us so I think the next thing to do is the next horizon
6988160	6994320	although I do think dynamic calls the modeling of evolutionary trajectories is an excellent idea
6994960	7000640	I suspect the heavy lifting now is to get the ideas that we've been talking about out there
7000640	7006240	I think that's what Michael and Hector have to do basically it's just keep keep on telling the story
7006240	7010320	and in my experience usually takes about five to ten years before people start listening
7010880	7020400	thank you Carl Michael with the last word
7022480	7029040	well there have been these sessions have been fun and most illuminating there is a lot to be done on
7029040	7035120	the matter of whether there have been phased transitions in the evolution of what we might
7035200	7040560	call evolvability in again as Homer over the past two million years there are big
7040560	7047840	arguments amongst human evolution specialists between whether there was a unitary evolutionary
7050400	7058160	whether a unitary evolutionary model is acceptable or as lumpers like myself would like to believe
7058160	7067600	or whether in fact there was a big bush with a lot of dead end separate unsuccessful
7068560	7081440	species like homo flori ciensis, homo allelusoniensis, homo allelidae or even perhaps Neanderthals
7081440	7085680	with whom I've had a lot of contact have excavated about 15 of them
7086240	7096400	and these arguments are highly relevant to the matter of cognitive evolution and indeed
7096960	7105840	as to whether the record of artifacts and tools can indeed inform us as I believe it can about
7106720	7117760	just how and how slowly I would say evolution proceeds proceeded and of course the splitters
7117760	7124800	believe it happened in leaps jumps and leaps I'm rather convinced Darwinist I believe that things
7124800	7131520	happen very very slowly and that we have to concentrate and with this I conclude on
7132160	7144400	the especially the neuro epigenetic modification of genetic expression as affecting not merely
7144400	7153520	morphology and physiology but also I would say cognition and the matter in hand of course
7154080	7164640	the ability or not to let our surprises affect one lookers and other people
7165440	7175520	permitting let's say modification of behavior in a very wide in a far wider with far wider results
7175520	7184240	than those that occur in many other species including some of those of our closest
7185200	7192080	closest primate relatives and thank you very much for organizing this session Daniel and Dean
7192960	7200240	it's been a pleasure to take part I'm sorry that I have this terrible appearance but I
7200880	7207920	I really can't do much about that at the moment I had well lost a few days
7210560	7214320	thank you all Michael at least you have an excuse I have no excuse
7220080	7227440	all right till next time long live the mean long live the variants thank you
7227440	7230320	you bye everybody
7257440	7259440	You
