0	16040	Hello and welcome. It's August 16th, 2023. We're in the Collective Behavior Discussion
16040	24280	section of the Active Inference for the Social Sciences course in 2023. So perhaps let us
24280	35680	all go around and give an opening introduction and or reflection and see who joins and what
35680	40120	happens from there. But just so that everybody has said hello.
40120	57840	Hi everyone, I'm Bryn. I'm PM in South Africa and yeah, just excited to be here and see what
57840	77840	happens. Hi, I'm Andrew. I'm a graduate student in Indiana and I guess my field of interest
77840	83480	now is the knowledge management and I think that figuring out how we collectively learn
83480	92680	and can share information is a really interesting topic and I'd like to see how this would apply.
98040	106560	Hi, I'm Regina and I'm from Guatemala, but I'm living in Spain, studying and doing experiments
106560	114400	related to this topic and trying to learn a little bit of the theory that's behind it so we can, you know,
114400	125360	advance better. I'm excited. Hello, my name is Sasha. I'm calling in from California. I'm also a graduate
125360	133480	student. Yeah, just really enjoyed the spirited presentation last week. I'm looking forward to
133480	146720	discussion. All right, well, how about anyone can give a first reflection on collective behavior or
146720	156960	what was their thought or context before and where are they at as we kind of begin? Yeah, Regina.
157400	169560	Okay, so I just want to make sure that I understand because I took like two big lessons from your
169560	177800	lesson, right? And the first one is that, you know, this famous model of active inference that has
178200	187160	the agent and the environment and the mark of blanket in the middle, right, and just interacts
187160	193520	with everything, right? So I think what I got from what you discussed, maybe I didn't have a good
193520	202040	definition of an agent, but first that you can have that agent not be just an individual, but also
202080	209720	your definition of an individual changes, depending on what you want to study in the behavior, right?
209760	219800	So an agent can be an ant, it can be an ecosystem, it can be an eye looking at something, or it can
219800	226120	be as a society, for example. And I think that's a big take for me because it changes a lot the
226120	233720	concept of how to study things and use active inference just by changing how big the agent can
233720	240000	be. So I don't know if I got that right, right? So first that clarification.
243560	244960	So what is an agent?
249880	255080	Yeah, so I don't know if there's like a formal definition of an agent in active inference, right?
255120	263240	But if we, if we want to study whatever we want to study, because I'm not going to study because I
263240	271120	have to do that's like my goal, whatever I'm doing. So I want to study whatever I have to choose
271160	278200	what's going to be my agent and the environment it has. So choosing the agent, you can do it to
278200	286760	create a model or to make an experiment, whatever. But the choice you make, it will depend on your
288600	293720	and what you understand as an individual or as an agent, I think so, right?
305200	306600	Awesome. Anyone have a thought on that?
306600	316720	No, if I continue with just to add something else and this will be my mind. And then I'm thinking is that
319040	329320	also a big problem that we have or I think I have is that since I am part of the environment, you
329320	333920	know, you know, the perspective of whoever is studying whatever it is, it's also going to be an
333920	341280	effect in it. So maybe, maybe scientists already decided, but I don't know that we can never have an
341280	349400	objective way of studying something if you're part of the environment of the agent. So I don't know
349400	354800	we already forgot it, or we already decided that's it. We cannot have objective observations of
354800	361480	behavior in general. But you know, you always think about like the agent environment, and you
361480	367520	start in it as something else, but the something else is also affecting it. So I see that as a
367520	373120	problem, or maybe something that has to be said, like, we are not objective, because we're part of
373120	380240	what it's affecting our agents in the behavior collectively too. So those are the thoughts I
380240	381280	have to share.
384120	391400	Regina, I'm also new to all of this. So my preliminary understanding of what is an agent,
391880	402120	is anything that has any good reason to self evidence, and to itself, or to survive,
403400	409160	that doesn't want to dissipate, that might delineate the boundary of what an agent is that then
409160	422760	sets up the boundaries with which it will, as you described, start interacting with the world,
422760	428880	the environment. So if something, as I understand it, if something has a reason to go on being, to
428880	436400	survive, then it is an agent in the world.
439200	445240	Okay, but that agent could be anything, right? Like, is that what you're saying, right? Like, if he
445240	451720	wants to survive, can be an ant surviving individually, or a cell or a group? Okay, yeah,
452000	454600	that's a good, that's like a good definition.
455040	462040	Yeah, Sasha.
462040	472160	Great points, Regina. So much to say there. It's something that I have experienced with as a
472160	480400	researcher in biology is deciding the kind of the statistics or sampling approach to use,
480520	488080	whether we're taking, you know, one cell from one individual, or we're taking many cells from
488080	495880	many individuals, and how to do the statistics and kind of sampling approach on that. That is a,
495880	502080	you know, an evergreen question that we're always reevaluating to see how to think about the
502120	511280	independencies within biological systems. And then another thing that you mentioned was about
511280	517640	the individual being part of the ecosystem. And that makes me think a lot about complexity
517640	524680	science and something that is addressed there in thinking about the interplay of the scientists
525280	531400	and what they're studying. Yeah, thank you for those points.
539400	546760	Sasha, sorry, I'm not raising my hand. I'm just unmuting. That's okay. Can you say a bit more
546760	549400	about what you mean by complexity science? It is
554680	566800	maybe muted. Oh, can't speak at the moment.
566800	577480	Yeah, complexity science has looked at agent, agent based modeling as a fundamental tool,
578360	585560	John Holland signals and boundaries, focusing on what, from an active inference side, we might say
585560	593320	as like message passing or communication for the messages and then boundaries with the whole
593320	601080	discussion around the boundaries in the world, map territory, map territory fallacy, map territory
601160	611480	fallacy, fallacy, doing iterative modeling. Sasha brought up limited experimental resources in the
611480	617880	scientific setting. And that's kind of analogous to the limited energy budget or attentional
617880	626360	budget, ultimately, or just decision making budget of the kinds of active entities that
626680	634680	make sense to model the ones that kind of have those characteristics. This is really the question
634680	641880	of what makes something first principles or what are the first principles. One aspect of it as brought
641880	649480	up is the censoring of the persistence. So from the outside, that's kind of like an empiricist's
650280	657000	view of persistence, like is it measurable, but not saying that something is necessarily that,
657000	663160	which is the statistical tool. And then the sort of like inside out implementation type.
665240	673560	But there's a lot more to say in that who wants to bring in some new angle or
673880	679960	or how do they see collective behavior? Why do we talk about collective behavior?
681720	686440	Why not just behavior, recognize that behavior is multi scale or is social?
689160	697640	What's really being communicated with the collective?
703880	709880	I mean, I believe that we chose those levels so we can make it more simple for our brains to
709880	715720	understand it. Because if we talk about collective behavior, actually is the universe
716680	724760	behaving in the particles and everything, right? So I don't know if that's a little bit just based
724760	730600	on I don't know what's the word like just in the material world and how it physically moves.
730600	740440	And that's like deterministic or whatever, right? But I think we chose to have those limitations
740440	745320	so we could understand the world. But also we should acknowledge that are limited because we're
745320	752440	part of the system. I'm having a little trouble on my kind of understanding the
753400	763800	I guess where the schism lies between kind of the Markov blanket and the Umwelt in
763800	768680	semiotics of like the animals sensory experience.
769000	783080	Anyone have a maybe maybe someone could I mean, Daniel, do you know
785160	786520	like the difference between that two?
788360	792360	Can you be a little louder? Thank you though. Andrew, anyone have a thought on that?
792920	798360	I'll bring in a definition of Umwelt and then and then we can see. But meanwhile,
798360	805800	does anyone have a thought? Sorry, I was just muted on Zoom. Andrew, you're a little quiet,
806440	812920	but I'm going to bring in a definition of Umwelt and then meanwhile, does anyone have a thought?
823320	826680	I hope I'm not
829400	840120	the diluting Andrews question. But I think of collective behavior in kind of like a,
840840	845560	I don't know, football team or soccer team. And what that provides
845720	851240	is the the group who is
853400	860760	share some common ethos and what that does to the how that regulates the their collective or
860760	867640	individual and collective free energies during a match or throughout the season and how that
867800	885960	that gives some charge to some investment because it's my team against yours. And we have to try
885960	896120	and win. And so, you know, without without that collective behavior, it's it's might be far harder
896120	905160	to achieve groups goals if they aren't able to collaborate and share, you know, implicitly and
905160	911720	explicitly certain traits, behaviors, thoughts, feelings, ideals, ideologies, whatever they might be
912360	916760	and how that then allows us to compete in the world.
916760	928920	I see what you think it's it's been. Yes. Okay. Okay. I see what you're seeing,
930040	933640	especially because we're watching the World Cup, right? Women's World Cup.
935480	940520	Yeah. So it's very relevant. Yeah. But I see that in all the
941480	946840	these things you've said, it seems that for you behavior needs to have like a goal.
947560	952920	And I don't know if I if I agree with that, it's either survival or winning.
954760	959480	But for me, it's just something that happens. And maybe the consequence is surviving.
960200	966840	But it's not the goal to survive or to win the game. I mean, in the football, it is right.
966840	973320	But in general, maybe there's no goal to the behavior collectively.
974520	978920	It's just just a thought. It's interesting.
981720	989320	Yeah, a great comments. Well, the paper of Connor Heinz at all on the collective behavior as
989320	997560	surprise minimization that points the way towards using the act in fontology, these kinds of modeling
997560	1003480	approaches for collective behavioral situations, and really just recognizing them as a certain type
1003480	1010840	of behavioral modeling. The simplest case might just be a single closed system.
1011800	1021800	All part of the composition that leads to the ability to describe at very least a lot of
1021800	1025720	different kinds of systems, just like a linear model can describe a lot of systems. So then
1026760	1032840	it's also really interesting, a topic that came up in one of the recent textbook groups
1033800	1042600	with what's normative about active inference. Because the term of the process theory, even
1042600	1049400	of active inference, being normative is mentioned multiple times. And that's definitely a topic
1049400	1058520	that connects to the social sciences. One can imagine the kind of niche normativity or niche
1059160	1067240	regularities in a broad sense, and then the real minute particulars of how they play out,
1067800	1076920	which kind of hints at the kind of descriptive or causal minimum to start making some
1076920	1081000	anything but toy specific generative models.
1081560	1095160	So it's been an interesting theme to see even already in Avel's and Ben's lectures and discussions.
1096920	1106520	This question between description, process of describing, which is what I associated with
1107080	1113560	Professor Gordon's approach to ant watching, how that descriptive process,
1114200	1121080	which is what we can say that we have for active inference, just like a linear modeling ecosystem
1121080	1129560	could say about their linear modeling in principle, and how to then articulate the
1129560	1137720	normativities of the framework, if that concept, if that separation can even exist
1139000	1151240	from the behavioral normativities that include the basis of social fabric in all different
1151240	1152280	kinds of communities.
1190040	1206360	Here's another question. So what is the role of any technical detail in the social sciences,
1207560	1215880	whether more on the statistical connecting with data or more category,
1215880	1223880	theoretic like just formal? What's the role of formal methods in
1226040	1231320	different kinds of academic or practical expressions about social systems?
1231960	1244200	Does it matter at all how we think about a framework at all?
1246360	1255160	Well, for formalizing aspects of a social system, I would say that the purpose is for
1255800	1265640	communication between individuals, because just we can't verify that.
1267080	1272360	Well, formalizing is just setting a system on top of what you're observing,
1274280	1282280	but there is no explicit guarantee that you're saying encompasses everything of the phenomena
1282280	1296600	you're observing. And just kind of going back to Taoism of the name that can be named is not
1296600	1305720	the true eternal name. And so it's just a way of, it's a slice of what we can observe,
1306680	1314840	and the way to, you know, maybe you can make predictions or maybe you can generate something
1314840	1323640	that acts like the phenomena you're observing, but it's just a way to kind of,
1328760	1334920	it's just a way to kind of approximate our understanding of some phenomena and you have
1335000	1338760	to slice it in a specific way, but also understanding that it is a slice or,
1338760	1341560	you know, it is a tangent line that you're approximating as opposed to
1342520	1346840	encompassing the whole system from verbalizing it.
1354840	1358520	I was at, maybe it's not the goal, but something that happened instead of
1359320	1366840	describing any system, like Andrew said, it's like the goal to modify it or to
1368680	1374440	or to co-opt it in some way to gain control or whatever. If you know the model,
1375000	1382200	you know how to play the game, kind of. So you write instructions and try to see if you can
1383160	1389960	outsmart someone else. I mean, it sounds kind of dark, right? But maybe it's one of the goals to
1389960	1394040	or something that just happens out of nulling the rules that nobody else's knows.
1398200	1400760	I mean, I guess when you talk about control, there is a
1404600	1411800	shade that can be gained from that specific wording, but control in terms of, you know,
1412200	1417400	control theory or, you know, that comes from electrical engineering. It's really just what
1419800	1425400	shapes the behavior or what are the inputs that drive the behavior. And when you're talking about
1425400	1431160	control, it's really just about, well, if you change these inputs, how does that change the
1431160	1440360	behavior? And so you can actually, you know, from electrical engineering of controlling some sort
1440360	1447640	of electromechanical system, but then you can make analogous statements on like control into
1447640	1452600	society, which doesn't necessarily mean like the dark negative control. But like, you know, maybe
1452600	1459320	there's some pathological behavior in a society or, you know, even pathological
1464040	1468440	pathological responses within the brain. And it's like, well, what is what is driving that?
1468440	1478600	And is it possible to change the drivers of that to have something that is more beneficial to the
1478600	1495000	system? Yeah, just to add to what Andrew's saying, because it matters sometimes how you manipulate
1495320	1507000	you know, a system or it matters how you affect a brain. So it cannot be random. I mean, you know,
1507000	1513640	we've come a long way, for example, from lobotomy, which had disastrous effects. And
1514600	1524520	it matters to a system how you affect it. And so to know more formally, the most effective way
1525320	1531640	to create a desired effect, whatever that might be, it's essential that it's not just kind of poking
1531640	1545480	and prodding. As much as that is part of the scientific method to update that method in
1545480	1555800	accordance with what you're learning. So it is important. No, I think you're both right. I
1555800	1563800	didn't have to be back. But also something that Andrew said about predicting, I think that's one
1563800	1575160	of also the big goals, trying to predict whether to be prepared to, or just to, I mean, couldn't be
1575160	1582520	to control, right? But if you can somehow predict how people respond to this or how a system will
1583160	1592360	behave in this other scenario, you can, you know, change what input is, or prepare for whatever comes,
1592360	1606200	I guess. Yeah, a lot of great points. Some of the commonly held, not equally by everyone, everyone,
1606200	1612680	but some of the tenants of science being to explain predict designing control,
1614440	1621560	where explanation and prediction are on the pathway towards systems designing and
1621560	1628280	and maintenance and other other words that people can add. But that's the pragmatic utility oriented
1628280	1633640	view, which doesn't have to be an absolutist view. But certainly there are regimes of attention
1633720	1643160	socially, now and seemingly for long, long times, where people were wanting to retain and to
1643160	1650280	constrain the variance distribution on what we would say is their generative model, some norm,
1650920	1657320	and then other times, engaging in these functions. And that instrumentalist usage of active inference
1657320	1666600	is like, we're going to be able to model it with a pretty minimum framework that's commonly used
1666600	1672840	in statistical systems, where some things we observe and some we don't. And at least we know
1672840	1679000	and how all the pieces are connected. And then that is an artifact in model based design,
1679240	1689880	as people develop that line through time socially, just like probably has been always
1689880	1694840	the case for complex projects and scientific collaboration.
1697640	1700120	There's a few other interesting pieces, but yeah, please, please.
1700840	1708760	I'm just, I'm just wondering if now that I'm thinking a lot, isn't that like a problem
1709880	1716440	for confirmation bias, right? Like, there's a paper in here here, because we create the
1716440	1721560	knowledge and we tell everyone the knowledge. This is the model, this is how everything behaves.
1721560	1727480	And then we update our knowledge about it. And then we look for everything to just,
1728280	1737160	you know, confirm it. And, and yeah, maybe there's another system that will not let us be
1738280	1742200	getting knowledge so slowly, because if everybody just agrees on something,
1742200	1747080	we teach it to everyone, and we confirm the model, and then we just try to look for evidence for
1747080	1753160	that model, then we go slowly if there's any better thing or better model that comes along.
1754040	1762840	Yeah, a lot to say about that, like, if we believe that trees exist or that people exist,
1762840	1765800	and then we come to see them. So there's kind of this sense where problem
1765800	1771960	confirmation bias, which I think it's a great term, a great topic to bring in with definitely also
1771960	1777400	what's called like the golden nail syndrome or something. If all you have is the hammer,
1777400	1782520	then everything's a nail. And there's definitely a tension there, because it's like,
1783960	1788520	how much of what you can do, are you supposed to do something that you can't do?
1789720	1793720	Or, but then at least you could do what you needed to do to get there. So that's actually
1793720	1797560	within your scope of what you can do. So it's not that there are things that you can do that you
1797560	1807320	can't do, if just from measurement perspective. So like, how does it look? Or how do we recognize
1807320	1816680	across systems? Or how do we have awareness in situations as limited individuals who do have
1816680	1824600	all of these cognitive phenomena, how to make decisions or sense making or infrastructure
1824680	1832040	or whatever it is, the socialness, the system of interest of the social sciences, make that
1832680	1835160	and then dot dot dot normatively what?
1839320	1847800	I think there's some protection built into the problem of confirmation bias because
1848360	1855560	all knowledge generation is happening in an open system. And so there's always going to be an
1855560	1865160	agent outside of your own mind and what it's perceiving that can then challenge or add to the
1865880	1878040	you know, like the LK-99 semiconductors that have been all the rage recently and how
1879160	1887640	other scientists have now kind of discredited it quite convincingly. And it's because of this open,
1887640	1892520	they might have had degrees of confirmation bias that they were egging each other on,
1892520	1900200	but it's ultimately been refuted, which is this built-in kind of protection because it's all
1900200	1913240	operating in an open system, fortunately. Yeah, a lot to say there. Monday morning, reviewer doing.
1914120	1923960	How do we again go from any given description of a communicative event like the kind of specific
1923960	1933320	unfolding of the LK-99 narrative as yet uncompleted in the minds of some, which is real enough
1933960	1940120	to be real socially. And so how do we go from any descriptive anything about that?
1941080	1953640	Total observation to core screening. Then how do we come to work with that interface with
1953640	1956360	what whatever that is hands that to us?
1965960	1976360	What is the social behavior or some some classic or some novel social behaviors?
1976760	1987080	Maybe ones that seem pretty obvious, due to recency bias.
1998840	2005000	I'll just mention one aspect that Andrew and I have also talked about is the auto-poetic
2005800	2012680	nature of information systems. Andrew, do you have any thought on this?
2013400	2021960	Or about where auto-poesis comes into like social sciences or these kinds of models?
2024280	2027720	Daniel, Andrew just left a note that he needs a... Okay, okay.
2029720	2033480	Oh, totally. He just wasn't looking at the time. Funny stuff.
2034280	2035480	Anyone else have a thought on that?
2041000	2047320	Okay, just to kind of carry forward then. Basically, the ability of social systems that
2047320	2058120	include written niche modification, cumulative culture, their increasing extent of control.
2059080	2065640	As discussed earlier, that definitely is a bit of an overloaded or at least doubly meant term
2065640	2070040	in different settings, because it can just simply mean modeling it with control theory,
2070600	2075080	which is a pretty limited philosophical statement relative to any statistical method,
2075080	2082440	or control like the kind that people are unhappy with and the kind that's described in
2082440	2089320	thinking like a state. A lot of other works that I know, Mao and Lorena and Avel are going to be
2089880	2097480	definitely going into more detail on... So when societies can model
2099400	2106680	and introspect or self-reflect formally, much better.
2112600	2119000	And that can happen through anything from free and open source,
2119720	2127800	better aided protocols. There's many limited formats of self-meaning making, but cryptography
2127800	2132520	definitely allows those explorations. And that doesn't necessarily mean computer cryptography.
2132520	2138280	That could also be like linguistic encoding and all these other ways of niche
2139240	2149560	sub-differentiation in multi-scale systems. You just do not see a system that is cookie cutter.
2150760	2157400	It's very rare in ecosystems. There are algal blooms and things like that.
2159640	2165480	So when we really think about the developmental and the cognitive and the selective niche,
2166440	2172200	which is a concept that Axel Constant and others have differentiated in some of their
2172200	2181160	like ecological active inference work, like that niche is very embodied, extended in culture,
2181160	2188520	et cetera, et cetera. It's just like a kind of cool direct way to open up to that challenge of
2188520	2202040	modeling and just bring some closures with different accounts or compatibilities with
2202040	2208600	different accounts. So like all, just to give one right of example, but maybe it'd be interesting
2208600	2217720	what other people think, all the expressions that people make in social settings can just simply
2217720	2229480	be their expressions or modeled as such. That is in one way implicitly what was always in play,
2231160	2242120	but now it's describable and legible and autonomous. So how do we take this active
2242200	2248360	inference collective behavior crossover and think about what it really means
2250040	2253960	in how we're going to be like thinking differently, even just this discussion forward
2254680	2265320	or like more locally are our understandings with collective behavior or with behavior.
2272120	2298600	Yeah, and you can you ask the question again. I didn't actually catch the
2299160	2310520	question. How do we start to adapt some of these general comments or frames that are
2311240	2317720	in some ways disconnected from descriptions of real systems? How do we think about that
2318040	2324520	and and what it means now?
2324520	2336120	Do you mean on the document in front of us? These disconnected things in front of us
2336120	2342840	there on the document? I don't know whatever you think or whatever you want to say.
2348040	2356840	Yeah, I think there's a lot and again I hope I'm not
2359880	2366520	fully understanding the question. I hope I'm not steering away too much, but I had a general
2366520	2375160	sense of what I think you were saying and I think it's an enormous problem with the amount of
2376120	2386520	information sharing just in a with let's just take the generative models of
2388280	2395640	social media and all of the platforms that are available to us. How much information we are
2395640	2407960	privy to in any given moment and I'm kind of forgetting the question that you asked.
2412440	2419720	It's almost as if there is such a high rate of information and data flow that it's really
2419720	2426920	hard to know what to do with all of it and at least as a human being I'm not saying from machines
2426920	2437720	but as a psychologist I'm certainly interested in how humans are able to tolerate and respond to
2437720	2455720	the amount and rate of information that's out there.
2455720	2469000	I mean this is not the first time this happens right? Like when we went from talking to writing
2469000	2476120	information then everyone wrote their information and then we have books and then we have libraries
2476120	2483480	and that's all available and again we have access if you can read right to all the information in
2483480	2493240	the world so we adapted to I don't know to get careers so we could specify in which type of
2493240	2500440	information you are going to know more so maybe we need some sort of new career types I don't know
2500440	2508040	more specification with more information. But is it not is the rate of information
2508360	2515800	uh flow and increases are not is it not exponential is it not um I don't know it's a crazy amount
2515800	2521400	on our brains cannot do anything about it so we have to do multidisciplinary things and work
2521400	2529640	together with others if we want to make something but yeah I don't know maybe we will die of excess
2529640	2533240	of information
2560600	2569960	how do people feel like active inference brings something to the discussion relative to
2571320	2573240	how they want to work towards
2573240	2591560	answer yeah well isn't that the provocative question too but like any system that's that
2591560	2596920	that's the question everyone is going to have their own memes and themes and and systems that they
2597720	2601320	have spent time with and did fieldwork with and all this other like
2601400	2606600	particularity because a system that doesn't have particularity is just not going to be
2607800	2616200	hosting a broad enough niche for for phenotypic diversity it's just riding on the edge of a
2616200	2622200	razor instead of more like a fabric that continues to unfold I think
2622280	2633160	there's a lot of work to do with the social sciences and active inference just from what I was
2633720	2637080	like reading trying to find things for this
2639080	2646200	um discussion and just I personally wondered what is is meaningful or interesting
2646600	2655480	or useful what's epistemic and pragmatic value for different audiences how does it go from kind of
2656600	2666200	bringing citations that were not linked together in some more theoretical or more
2666200	2673400	generative model oriented work in active inference like epistemic foraging or the
2673400	2680120	inference model or any other kind of specific model what what are these different kinds of
2680120	2682520	scientific artifacts do
2685960	2696840	for who
2696840	2705720	I guess I'm still learning very
2709160	2709560	very
2712440	2718360	kind of crudely ploddling along here Daniel with to try and answer that because it's
2718360	2724280	quickly realized that the field is it's so multi-nodal it has so much
2725000	2735320	and the free energy principle the Bayesian brain even just to psychology has so much
2735320	2741640	applicability and everyone seeing everyone I meet at these discussions is coming at it from
2741640	2748920	a different angle and it can be a bit confusing to hear how other people
2749800	2755400	are applying it how other people are making use of it
2756840	2765480	in all manner of ways and so I'm still learning how to apply to kind of ring fence the free energy
2765480	2772680	principle and connect it to psychological processes including collective behavior
2772680	2778760	and because there's a lot of psychopathology in group think in collective behavior but I'm also
2779560	2783400	very very interested in its application at the interface of
2784920	2792760	what happens between a a therapist and a patient and I'm often unlike other
2793480	2801960	professions who seem who are just by nature of the scientific method are able to extract
2802840	2815800	a lot more data to work with to analyze to you know in a that's very hard to do I feel very limited
2816440	2820360	other than just making kind of theoretical leaps and inferences about how to apply
2822840	2831560	the free energy principle to psychology. I can't have a session with my brain hooked up to
2832040	2840840	an FMRI machine to get data and to see when a patient says Google bar that's a spike on the
2840840	2847160	spike trains which represents you know surprising and we can then solve for that in some way and
2847160	2853400	I don't have access to that sort of data flow so it feels limited but I'm still learning how to
2854040	2869320	apply it and yeah and trying to collaborate with colleagues on that the influence group.
2875480	2881400	What are people wondering about collective behavior even if we're totally of course not
2881400	2885160	going to address it but just what what are the kinds of things that people
2889240	2895800	what makes you look up collective behavior instead of just behavior or individual behavior.
2896760	2910280	For me it's about safety and need to belong.
2910360	2917160	For me it's
2920040	2926360	I think that it depends where you come from and in the country you are but
2927080	2932040	there are places that are more collective and there are places that are more individualistic and I
2932040	2938120	think mostly non-western countries have a lot of collective behavioral knowledge and
2938840	2946440	spirits already right that they're already new these things that we think are new for us right how
2946440	2953560	the collective thing works for example I don't know you don't make a decision for yourself
2953560	2960360	you make a decision for the group like marrying you marry because you want an addition you want to
2960360	2966440	interact with someone or other group and that's something that affects the the collective not
2966440	2972840	just you so arranged marriage makes sense something like that right so for me making that
2972840	2978040	distinction about individual collective comes from understanding that I don't know there are
2978040	2983720	other places that are already ahead in what collective means in terms of human beings and
2983720	2989320	how to interact and the worst through all we have all this individualistic thing which is
2990040	2997480	very interesting because why do we have a same species and then we have very different approaches
2997480	3003000	of how to understand ourselves in terms of what the individual is and why it matters
3003160	3020440	yes there's so much loaded on different understandings among people including
3020440	3026440	even the the essence of the social which is who are people and what is the
3027320	3038920	the obligation and how do we view that that relationship that's a very very deep area and
3038920	3043320	and again the part that just kept returning to me in the lecture and when I was trying to think
3043320	3052680	about how to how to even reflect part of this very large area is like what is the adjective doing
3052920	3060600	and what what is what's the reference point by which this is being said in the speech acts
3061240	3069160	like people often will dismiss I don't mean to you know straw people but dismiss collective
3069160	3073800	behavior by saying well we are explaining individual behavior what are you explaining
3073800	3082440	beyond the estimates in the colony and then the exterior like that is it and so that can feel
3082440	3088600	like looking at the same thing from two different sides and there are different methods like some
3088600	3095640	methods blur over individuals a lot more like statistical methods that might correspond to
3095640	3099720	demographics and then on the other hand like more agent-based models
3100680	3110680	but how much variability in what shared variability in white general
3110680	3116360	synchronies amongst different quantum reference frames all these nested
3117960	3126280	if these possibilities that are grounded in wanting to explore mathematical and scientific
3126280	3133400	possibilities as as the literature of linear regression is full of so many incredible
3134120	3144360	extensions and and and similar and then that's I think what the course is even beginning to
3145640	3151880	to try to express and what what I understand in the works of the the other teachers and
3151880	3158840	like a lot of your backgrounds and and everything like that is where is that
3161240	3168120	moment where it is not only science because science is not simply the social
3169480	3174360	so science has an activity and then as there's a diffusion away from science
3174360	3181800	and and I think that or or at least that relationship between social and science is
3181800	3189000	right there in the title maybe that's kind of like a science major's take but but it is itself
3189000	3198600	in a way a um presenting a dilemma with what science means there and then that's the frame game
3199320	3206600	who's doing social science who's doing not social science and that's that's where
3208120	3215480	in in the culture I'm sitting in slash in the technical side of that it is related to statistics
3215480	3227320	and formality it's the xkcd comic and the way that formalisms and and details are taken as
3228360	3235560	under some regimes of attention basically definitive and yet there's like a yearning
3235560	3244760	and a counter balancing that's expressed also in many ways and so that's and science maybe
3244760	3249720	some people feel like certain social scientific methods that's like not far enough in this dimension
3249720	3256120	and then the others feel like they're too far in this direction but it's like just like any
3256120	3261720	like that academic field let alone any other community of diverse agents like of course
3261720	3270280	there's going to be distributions of perspectives at different times and and at takes rate of
3270280	3280680	uptake by those different perspectives and no yeah Daniel do you think uh these first principles
3283000	3291560	would be able to explain why uh an ant colony exists uh I know that was your um a kind of
3291560	3299080	area of interest of study uh why an ant colony exists uh in in the way that it is as a kind of
3299080	3310840	operating as a collective and why um another animal is able to survive and achieve its goals
3313800	3320520	as an individual only relying on the environment and its actions and sensations to get its needs
3320520	3328360	met and to no doubt minimize its free energy but could first principles explain why the one
3328360	3334360	has to survive as a group and the other has to survive or is able to survive um and the different
3334360	3343480	conditions yeah that's a super interesting question it's it's very core to this individual
3343480	3351560	individuation and multi-scale individuation concept like is the nest made the individual and
3351560	3357640	then the colony is the social because then for sure it's super collaborative or is the colony
3357720	3364280	the organism and the nest mates are tissues and then are they social across colony boundaries
3364280	3368520	not where I was in Arizona but they're often friendly across different species and they
3368520	3374040	avoided conflict more often than not so it's like well and then go it why does it even matter
3374040	3381240	what's happening on this plot of lands in this in this area from like a biomimic
3381240	3388680	perspective we might learn new algorithms it's a sandbox for learning new techniques and
3388680	3394520	observation all these other like richnesses so it's to say though like what comes away from that
3395080	3403400	science that makes it social science and I think there's a lot of disciplinary ways of
3403400	3409160	understanding that which which I'm definitely not expert in in in the um professional fields like
3409560	3417320	counseling but probably in in all the different humanities and histories and all these other
3417320	3429720	fields all these different maps the kind of social um the epistemic organizing question
3431080	3438120	and then the social organizing question yeah and and the way like technology is also in that
3438120	3446520	tangle and yeah someone pointed out like this is not a new problem and uh but then it's like well
3446520	3451080	what parts are new and then what's our model by which we're saying that it's like new or two
3451080	3455640	individualists or two collective on what scale what if they're like really collectivist at this
3455640	3463960	scale but not at this scale or another an example of an ambiguous or at least like um poly poly
3463960	3470280	submits phenotype of colonies is in some colonies there's partial reproductive activation
3470920	3480600	of like non reproductive nests and that has often been modeled from like a position of like
3480600	3487080	zero is the law and how are they cheating above this but it's also been approached from a
3487080	3496120	colony level strategic bed hedging so without super deep knowledge of really some of the specifics
3496120	3504600	of the regularities that that colony algorithm had to persist for so long and to have gotten swept
3504600	3510760	off the table if it was even it's like that's that's a very integrated problem so it helps you
3510760	3515800	approach collective systems and and learn about them but it's like there's a lot to say about
3515880	3524600	humidity loss in foraging and humidity loss isn't even the whole picture and human foraging is a
3524600	3532360	lot more sophisticated from just like a perception cognition influence perspective
3534280	3540440	so those are just some ant related thoughts but it's it just centers a lot of discussions that
3540440	3546760	really matter and I think the really interesting piece is not always in the way that they're
3547480	3554920	thought to by some yeah and it's and it's very hard to get any kind of
3555880	3564600	cross pollination or to see cross pollination uh studying one agent it's it's quite for at least
3564600	3569960	in my mind very difficult to kind of generalize things across different agents and it starts
3569960	3582840	getting a bit uh yeah tricky to infer one collectives and uh how and why and and how
3582840	3590360	they survive and how another agent does it's tricky so I'm almost just kind of an agent
3590360	3595560	human beings as hard as they are to study and just try and run with it as far as possible
3596520	3602280	yeah otherwise it's just information overload
3612200	3622120	body's a complex place too and digital technology virtuality these are such um
3622200	3626520	richly developed topics in the social sciences I only know the tiniest amount from
3627640	3635720	but I think that through participation and inclusion in collaboration and in conversations
3635720	3646520	and everything there's going to be a lot of interesting connections and paths um and
3647480	3655480	and it's being approached seemingly uh multiple layers like within the the two layers that just
3655480	3662200	we can focus most narrowly on it's like within the realm of science what is science which is
3662200	3668520	kind of like playing this other um role with inertia in some people's minds and in systems
3668520	3672120	what is science who gets to decide what social sciences I don't know I'm I'm not in social
3672120	3679080	science but it's system of interest in society and certainly I'm a part of that um so it's like
3679960	3689480	what is the what is good technically what is social scientific and then what is that social
3689480	3696120	scientific how does that going to interface into the the metaphysical questions and and the normative
3696120	3706280	ethical and um decision making with trade-offs and the real reflexive complex decisions that matter
3707960	3716120	also while recognizing this increasingly nuanced way of thinking about different social intelligences
3726120	3734120	what's any other random thought or curiosity about collective behavior
3745240	3752280	one point that I would have added into the uh lecture was just that in distributed systems
3752280	3760840	whether as modeled or as such all behavior is arising from interactions local to individuals
3760840	3765080	even if it's sent through some wireless mechanism it's like all about the local interactions
3765960	3774680	and so that is a an arising type process that gives the modeler like one hands-off layer
3775000	3784680	at least if not much more another nice feature about them um they are in a way
3786200	3793160	waiting to be composed because they intrinsically contain like at least two layers of consideration
3794200	3799160	now whether there's kind of like a forcing function of one layer and just sort of dangling
3799160	3804040	a bottom layer or whether there's a lot of what we would call emergence or discussive in in that way
3804040	3811640	like that more arising function can be modeled but in either way then you can kind of wrap
3812200	3818360	that two-layer system and then compose them so that's like what enables in certain situations
3818360	3825720	like parallelization or at least you know that's obviously a big area but that's what allows multi
3825800	3833160	agent simulation frameworks to do well on certain very challenging
3834760	3841640	sense making and action selection problems not by guarantee or default because any given
3842440	3848200	slicing and dicing of any given um prompting of information may not help you adapt
3848200	3858440	but there are paths that do and don't help persist or not and that's this kind of persistence
3859320	3870360	starting place that we began with Sasha um can I really resonate with what you mentioned about
3870360	3882120	the local interactions that even if information is transmitted over long distances then the agents
3883800	3889960	behave in a way that is locally relevant and integrates that information and it actually
3889960	3899560	makes me think a lot about the like psychology therapy angle that while you try to get information
3899560	3908920	about persons like um sort of local environment and behavior um or like perhaps you know demographics
3908920	3917240	and age that um their informational environment and like wealth of what kind of information they
3917240	3930280	consume might also be really telling about their uh psychological and like behavior interactions or
3930280	3941800	pathologies um and then to bring it kind of full circle back to um that the researcher is part of
3941800	3954760	the ecosystem that they are uh studying um yeah I I think it's just um such a difference in
3954760	3961240	perspective to see that as like a positive and a gift that um the way that you would design and
3961240	3967160	run an experiment today is not the way that you would do it two years from now with more experience
3967160	3976920	and so um that is a a a benefit and like a bonus in the system and not um like a negative
3976920	3984920	perspective of bias that it's detracting from some underlying uh truth or reality
3987160	3988360	so just a few thoughts
3988360	3997960	oh very interesting anyone want to add something
4004920	4010520	I think we didn't fully resolve this early question about the umvelte um term from ethology
4010520	4018200	behavioral research observation science uh using the term to describe the world as its experience
4018200	4024360	by a particular organism I think a few different pieces and there's a lot of discussion in discourse
4024360	4030680	or just just to give it like a super short overview the world we might connect to world
4030680	4037960	modeling and there's a lot of interesting work in all kinds of different like pros focus on
4037960	4044920	qualitative systems as well as some artificial or synthetic intelligence world modeling as it
4044920	4051720	experienced as it is experienced is one of the sticky and deep ones because this is the area
4051720	4059480	phenomenology and so this is like a kind of semi-eternal discussion point so whether whether
4059480	4066280	active inference delivers on world modeling is kind of empirical and just plain whereas as it
4066280	4072440	is experienced is going to be a philosophical question and then by a particular organism
4072440	4078920	that specificity we get by actually making the generative model even if we're just speculating
4078920	4086840	about it it's like talking about experience without an experiencer would be like talking about um
4088200	4096360	some agent's behavior without reference to its niche and then where there is like that complex
4096360	4104360	negotiation I think the humanities and a lot of the social sciences have identified a lot of the
4105720	4114840	structural top down and also the personal bottom up motifs of of things being
4116920	4124440	blurred and made complex and so I think part of the social and the scientific as
4124440	4134280	coming only from scientific side is like to to meet in a third space and or at least make it work
4135160	4137080	to have a mutual compromise where it's like
4139400	4144920	certain social science social oriented claims based upon this scientific measure
4145640	4150120	that is going to be a judgment call but understanding that conversation where is it a
4150120	4157080	mutual compromise and like what dimensions not simply along the kind of like rigor accessibility
4157080	4164040	or implications axis there's just very many things in play in these iterated relationships in ecosystems
4164040	4183800	like having a researcher as part of the ecosystem well what is it here's here's the forager question
4183800	4188920	you see the nested on the ground it's a forager but then we step back it's like okay well it's foraging
4189000	4197320	and then that's the allocation of the forager then it's foraging is still part of this sense
4197320	4204520	making is generative sense making with like process understanding even of a trace which is something
4204520	4210120	that Bruno Latour and others have have explored with like following a trace in a social setting
4210120	4218360	and using that to to trace networks so in our digital ecosystems though our information ecosystems
4219720	4226200	is not research happening and so what what does that really mean and then what what are those
4226200	4233160	social normativeities there's going to be like a meeting or a handoff with with where that really
4233160	4245800	is happening or maybe it's a knocking on the door that's ignored or it could be whatever
4245800	4251960	metaphor in that setting it actually is there's no general metaphor because that'd be like oh what's
4251960	4259000	the general metaphor on this experiment which experiment just the general action that we play
4259000	4272200	the sake oh hard to say
4289640	4296120	okay well in our last like actions I guess if anybody types a question live chat we'll look
4296120	4309400	at it otherwise what are any other thoughts or like what what can we learn more about about
4309400	4315400	collective behavior or what will it mean for our sense making decision making if we understand
4315400	4328600	collective behavior better
4345400	4346300	you
4376280	4382920	what else are people excited about for the rest of the course
4390600	4393160	like based upon the sections that we've done so far
4393400	4406200	and and how we can even even start to approach this in an acknowledged limited finite way
4408280	4410120	yeah Sasha then than anyone else
4413800	4419480	I just added a question to the very bottom of the notes and it makes me think about
4420440	4426280	how working on this document collaboratively throughout the last hour we're able to
4427880	4435480	kind of leave a stigmatic trace of things we've discussed and what sort of traits or practices
4435480	4443000	should individual humans I guess I should specify humans should be embodied in order to improve
4443080	4449880	cohesion in collective behavior it makes me think of certain psychology
4452360	4458680	traits or descriptions of like openness or conscientiousness
4460760	4469880	what will make individual humans better participants in collective behavior
4473000	4487560	yeah I think to to add to that to just emphasize the importance again only with human agents
4488680	4496120	specifically who have the capacity to think and reflect and the only ones that have that those
4497080	4503800	really advanced capabilities that we know of as yet but to really kind of leverage
4506360	4512600	in order to make the collective better there's a responsibility on the individual
4513640	4519560	despite being part of a collective and on many different on many different fronts to be able to
4520440	4528200	leverage and utilize their own internal states and what they have learned and to be able to think
4530520	4537640	to retain the individual the individual's mind and think about the collective I think is so
4537640	4546440	important if the collective is to become healthier Sasha to your point and to improve its
4550520	4557560	you have to become more conscientious and become more responsible or whatever that might be
4563800	4566360	so to always try and maintain a thinking
4571000	4578120	self is crucial in words you can very easily be usurped into the collective as is
4580280	4584200	if you just go on any social media media platform you will see
4587160	4588760	individuals rarely thinking
4590600	4596600	for themselves and seemingly kind of just purely in each other and that causes massive problems
4597640	4604200	so an individual mind is strikes me as being just the most important thing in the future going forward
4609560	4617960	yeah this dialectic with individuation and collectivization as these like ongoing
4619000	4623960	negotiated compromises that can be also viewed many ways however they are
4632200	4634120	cognitive science coming into play
4634360	4644040	maybe historical processes or philosophies were
4647160	4649880	used in many settings for
4651880	4658680	even approaching these kinds of social questions and now with computer science and technology
4658920	4667000	it even like is a discussion more about the capacities of measurement and action
4668520	4673400	not that those are new in and of themselves like but thinking like a state like the development
4673400	4681000	of the apparatus the development of the social social systems that can be run on on open source
4681000	4691000	hardware open source software things like that so I don't know if something's generalized across
4691000	4702440	all such groups but understanding what environments at least initially things are beginning at
4702840	4712360	is just a realist starting point probably no guarantee since most things slash all things
4712360	4723160	are swept off the table in their specifics anyway so and how to deal with that kind
4723160	4730840	of like skin on the line type of decision making is very interesting how it's pursued
4730840	4738440	in the in the sciences because often like many runs are presented or that kind of like like
4738440	4742840	catastrophic failure mode of models is is not considered just like part of the training starting
4742840	4754200	naive so just the way that different social considerations are converged upon it's never
4754200	4760760	it's not like reduced to one feature of the social because the social is such an open space
4763880	4768920	as a scientist always impressed by how that writing could kind of open up
4770520	4777800	the um situations which are like mundane but also of course very deep and meaningful
4777800	4781400	also though mundane
4807960	4808520	you
4819400	4828600	any other thoughts or otherwise uh on on collective behavior or on the social sciences
4828600	4834120	course or anything otherwise people can have any last words if they want
4838680	4845720	yeah awesome thank you all for participating David want to add anything
4855720	4859800	yeah well i look forward to uh more questions being asked on the course
4860600	4866280	website and everybody's um engagement with the course is very much appreciated
4866280	4872520	so keep up the collective thanks for my scale learning and it's it's a fun course really happy
4872520	4876520	that we could have done this session and very happy to have concluded the session
4880120	4885800	all right thank you bye bye bird ciao
4896280	4896780	you
