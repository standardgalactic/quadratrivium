Hello and welcome, everyone. This is Physics as Information Processing, Session 4 on Communicating

2
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:20,960
Observers. It's the 10th of August 2023. Chris, looking forward to this lecture off to you.

3
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,320
Thank you, Daniel, and welcome to this session.

4
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:32,480
As Daniel said, this is about communicating observers and fastening your seatbelts,

5
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,200
because we have a lot to cover in the next hour.

6
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:43,440
So just to do a quick review, we've been talking about quantum information theory,

7
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:51,200
and we've been talking about it in the simplest possible setting of two systems, Alice and Bob,

8
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,440
that exchange information through their mutual boundary.

9
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,920
And we've assumed that everything is finite dimensional, so we don't need to worry about

10
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:08,320
infinite energy transfer across this boundary. And of course, we assume conservation of energy,

11
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,520
so there are no sources or sinks in either of the systems Alice and Bob.

12
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:21,040
And we emphasize that this way of depicting things as topological, we're not assuming any

13
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,400
background geometry, no sort of spatial embedding, which is going to become very important in this

14
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:35,360
session. In the last session, we talked about how the boundary, which I'll always call B,

15
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:42,720
it can be thought of as a channel that comprises in qubits that are independent,

16
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:50,320
and Alice and Bob each can prepare and measure those qubits. And they can always choose

17
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:56,240
independently their reference frames for doing so, so how they define up and down when they're

18
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:03,920
measuring a spin with effectively a Z-spin operator to interact with these qubits.

19
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:10,320
We talked a little bit about the free energy principle and its quantum formulation.

20
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,360
And the principle basically says that interacting systems will behave in a way that aligns their

21
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,800
reference frames and that they therefore asymptotically approach entanglement.

22
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:30,320
So the FEP is a classical limit of the principle of uniterity. And that's one reason for studying

23
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:37,280
quantum information to learn more about the FEP and so to learn more about active inference

24
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,800
and what the theory of active inference says about agents.

25
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:51,520
And last time we talked a lot about the constraints that are imposed by a limited free energy supply

26
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:59,280
on any agent. Recall that we talked about the fact that in the absence of sources of free energy

27
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:08,560
within an agent, so as long as you conserve energy globally, that the free energy that each

28
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:15,680
agent uses has to come from its environment. That's clearly true for us. We have to consume oxygen

29
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:23,200
and eat food and things like that to keep running as systems. And we discussed a little bit this

30
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:32,000
theorem that if two reference frames or quantum processes Q1 and Q2 don't commute,

31
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,920
they have to be implemented by compartments that communicate classically. And we'll use this

32
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:45,200
extensively today. But the bottom line last time was that physics alone gives us compartmentalization

33
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:51,680
in systems whenever the systems are complex enough to have multiple kinds of measurements that they

34
00:03:51,680 --> 00:04:03,360
can't deploy simultaneously. So where we're going, today we're going to start from this

35
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,520
place we left off last time of the possibility of agents that are compartmentalized

36
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:17,120
and into compartments that have to communicate classically. So we're going to talk about agents

37
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:24,000
that can be compartmentalized into multiple subagents that share an environment, the environment

38
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,480
consisting of Bob, and how those agents talk about that shared environment.

39
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:38,240
So the motivation for this is simple. It's that what we do all the time is a group activity.

40
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,440
And what we're doing right now is a group activity that involves sharing an environment,

41
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:52,880
what's shown on this screen, and talking about it. And the whole post-session discussion process

42
00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:00,800
will be another example of just that sort of thing. So to talk about science at all, or to talk

43
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:06,960
about any kind of social relations, or to talk about anything other than solipsism, we have to

44
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:12,640
be able to talk about how multiple agents communicate about some shared environment.

45
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,600
And so that's what we're going to develop a formal way of talking about.

46
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:27,520
And there are two things to notice right off the top about this. One is that the way we've defined

47
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:33,200
interactions of boundaries, they're effectively instantaneous. So each agent, remember,

48
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:40,240
interacts with its boundary with some set of operators. And what those operators do is

49
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:46,720
effectively measure, each operator effectively measures the spin of a cubic. So this is a very

50
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:57,200
fast process. The other thing that we then need to notice is that if we have two agents,

51
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:06,320
and they're communicating with each other classically, then they're going to be using degrees

52
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:12,160
of freedom of their shared environment in order to communicate. And that's exactly what we're

53
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:20,240
doing right now. For example, we're using degrees of freedom of the internet to communicate. I'm

54
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:26,880
using degrees of freedom of the local atmosphere to talk to my microphone. And I'm using degrees of

55
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:36,000
freedom of the local photon field to see my screen. So all communication between agents,

56
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,920
and certainly all classical communication between agents,

57
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,760
uses degrees of freedom of the environment. And the environment, remember, is the other system,

58
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:52,480
Bob, that's on the other side of that shared boundary. So we're going to be interested in

59
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:59,680
how components of Alice use Bob as a communication channel, and in fact, as multiple communication

60
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:07,280
channels. And I just wanted to quote my colleague and friend, Mike Levin, in his statement that

61
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:15,440
all intelligence is composite. All of us, all organisms, even single cells, are composite

62
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:23,520
systems that comprise many, many different agents that are able to make different kinds of measurements

63
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:29,040
and execute different kinds of actions, and so have to communicate classically.

64
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:37,040
So we're talking about all of life here, as well as all of social systems and ecosystems,

65
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:45,360
and such things as that. So the first thing I want to do today is simplify the notation

66
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:52,160
so that we don't have to draw quite such complicated diagrams. So the picture on the left

67
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:58,800
here is a picture from the last session. It shows the structure of a very simple agent that

68
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,560
makes some measurements using a reference frame called E, and then writes some results of those

69
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:13,440
measurements to memory using a reference frame called Y. And those two processes are connected

70
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:21,840
by an internal clock that ticks between the input process and the output process. And the clock

71
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:27,600
tick corresponds to the expenditure of free energy to write information irreversibly on the

72
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:33,280
boundary. So the memories are actually written on the boundary because that's where classical

73
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:40,160
information lives in this theory. So you can think of this whole process from E through the clock and

74
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:47,840
back to Y as a single quantum process or as a quantum computation that maps some sector E of

75
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:54,560
the boundary to some sector Y of the boundary. And so we can represent it in this much simpler way

76
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:02,400
that's over on the right side as some process Q that maps some sector on the boundary to some

77
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:09,920
other sector on the boundary. And formally, that process can be thought of as a topological quantum

78
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:16,640
field theory. Topological here is important. It's not geometric. It doesn't assume an embedding

79
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:24,400
in space. And this will become critically important later on. And the operation of that

80
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:33,280
TQFT requires a clock tick, or it incorporates a tick of this internal clock.

81
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:44,640
And we can do this because we were able to prove, Jim Glaceburg and Tonino Marchiano and I were

82
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:51,040
able to prove last year, that we can always represent a quantum reference frame as a topological

83
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:56,640
quantum field theory. And this just illustrates the two kinds of transformations between

84
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,240
quantum reference frames that are important. We can take one and divide it into two pieces

85
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:12,800
that commute, or we can take a two-part reference frame, and we can swap in

86
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:20,320
another part that doesn't commute with the part that we've swapped it in for, but that does commute

87
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:28,320
with the remainder of the reference frame. So here, R is the reference component of some object

88
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:35,920
identification system. And we can swap in some different way of looking at the object

89
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:42,320
once we've identified. So for example, if the object that we're identifying is a box that can

90
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:51,280
measure both Z-spin and X-spin, then P and Q can be the Z-spin and X-spin settings on that box

91
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:58,400
that allow us to effectively rotate the filter from this way to that way, so that we measure

92
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:05,920
vertical spin versus horizontal spin. And that's really it. I mean, those are the ways that one

93
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:12,320
can transform quantum reference frames. Of course, we can do arbitrarily many compositions of this

94
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:18,080
kind of transformation to do something very complicated, but they map very simply to TQFTs

95
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:25,120
with the structure, and you can construct categories out of this and find a fumpter that's

96
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:32,000
well-defined that maps one category to another. So it's an example of the niches of categorical

97
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,080
techniques for solving a problem that looks difficult, but in fact, it's very straightforward.

98
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:47,360
So using this simplified notation, it becomes very easy to see

99
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:54,560
that if we have two systems, Alice and Bob, on opposite sides of this boundary,

100
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:03,760
and we perfectly align their quantum reference frames, which is what the FEP says they will

101
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:12,560
tend to do, then they become entangled. And you can see that they're entangled by seeing that once

102
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:19,680
the reference frames are perfectly aligned, they jointly implement one quantum process.

103
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:29,040
And jointly implementing one quantum process just means you're entangled. The two sides no longer

104
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:38,080
have conditionally independent states. If one quantum process, which is time reversible,

105
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:46,960
information preserving, is implemented jointly by the two systems. So a lot of things like

106
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:57,680
this become very simple when we think of these processes as just quantum computations going on

107
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:05,680
inside some system implemented by some system and how those processes relate across some boundary.

108
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:12,320
So that's what we're going to do for studying communication today.

109
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:21,840
Another thing to recall from a couple of sessions ago, or last session, is that if two

110
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:31,520
reference frames Q1 and Q2 commute, we can always join them together to form a single

111
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:38,160
reference frame. And this is just a graphical depiction in this simpler language of how that works.

112
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:46,800
And topologically, there's no distinction between the left side and the right side.

113
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,520
What I've done is just squeeze the top two green circles together and the bottom two

114
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:58,480
green circles together into one circle. And that just makes a simple process connecting

115
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:04,320
the top one to the bottom one. So what we're going to be interested in is situations where this

116
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:14,880
doesn't happen, where Alice consists of two components that execute reference frames that

117
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:24,240
don't commute. And so the two components are conditionally independent. They do each have

118
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:31,280
free choice of reference frame. And so they have to communicate classically. They don't share

119
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:41,840
a single quantum process. So they're not entangled. And before we go ahead to do that,

120
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:50,240
I just wanted to remind you of some of the no-go theorems that follow from this situation

121
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:58,480
depicted on the right, where we have a single agent executing a single reference frame,

122
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:05,840
a single process, a single kind of measurement, any set of commuting measurements that can be

123
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:11,760
combined into one measurement. And here's some things Alice can't do. And we've talked about

124
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:21,920
some of these previously. So this is basically a reminder. But Alice can't, using just one

125
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:29,200
measurement, measure the entanglement entropy across her own boundary. So Alice can't know

126
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:36,720
that she has an independent state. She can't know that she's not entangled with Bob. And that's a

127
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:44,400
useful thing to think about philosophically, as it applies to you and me. We can't actually know

128
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:52,560
that we have independent states. Alice can't measure her own entanglement entropy. So she

129
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,360
can't know whether she has components that have to communicate classically.

130
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:06,000
She can't measure Bob's entanglement entropy. So she can't know whether Bob has compartments

131
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,120
that have to communicate classically. And if you think in terms of perception theory,

132
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:18,400
this says Alice can't know whether Bob consists of separate objects that behave classically.

133
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:27,440
Their behavior can look classical to her. But she's not able to determine that their

134
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,640
behavior is classical because she can't measure Bob's entanglement entropy.

135
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:42,080
She can't measure the dimension of her own boundary. And recall from a couple of times ago

136
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:49,440
that the boundary includes some sector that supplies free energy that Alice can't extract

137
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,080
information from for further processing. She can only extract free energy from.

138
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:01,920
So she can't measure the dimension of that sector. And so she can't measure the dimension of the

139
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:07,760
whole boundary itself. And this of course means that she can't measure her own dimension either.

140
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:12,960
And of course she can't measure Bob's dimension because the only information she can get about

141
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:18,480
Bob is the classical information that's encoded on this boundary. She can't reach past the boundary

142
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:26,320
to see how large a system Bob is. And that's clearly connected to this first point that she

143
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:31,760
can't measure the entanglement entropy across Bob because the entanglement entropy can only be small

144
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,360
if her dimension and Bob's dimension are both much larger than the dimension of the boundary.

145
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:45,360
So that's a condition she can't check. So all of these kind of no-go theorems lead off an interesting

146
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:53,920
direction. And the only one that we're really going to be interested in here is the third one,

147
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:59,520
the one about measuring Bob's entanglement entropy because we want to talk specifically about how

148
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:07,600
multiple agents, so multiple components of Alice, can access information about Bob's entanglement

149
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:19,360
entropy. Okay, so recall from the end of the last session that the last thing we talked about was

150
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:26,240
classical communication. And we talked about the fact that classical communication involves

151
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:31,280
assumptions and pitfalls and that we have to be very careful whenever we talk about it.

152
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:38,880
And what we're going to do today is standard practice in physics. We're simply going to stipulate

153
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:46,720
that of these components, A1 and A2, the separable components of Alice communicate

154
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,040
classically. And so we're going to draw out like this. We're going to draw a classical channel

155
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:57,760
between them. And that classical channel passes through Bob. It uses degrees of freedom of the

156
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:04,800
ambient photon field or the ambient atmosphere or pieces of paper or email or something like that

157
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:11,360
that's out there in the environment to exchange classical messages. And there are a couple of

158
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,960
things to note here. I haven't even written down here. We're assuming that A1 and A2 share some

159
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,840
language for this classical communication. That's a big assumption as we talked about last time.

160
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:30,240
But I will note explicitly that classical communication takes time. That's what defines

161
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,760
classicality here. It's causal. So it can't work faster than the speed of light.

162
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:42,480
This is a topological theory. We don't have an embedding geometry. So we can't at this point

163
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:48,640
talk about light, which is a relationship between space and time. Because we've got time,

164
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:55,600
we've got clocks, but we don't have any space. But we can say that whatever passes through

165
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:04,560
this classical channel requires at least one clock tick on Bob's side. So it's a process that

166
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:14,160
Bob has to execute. And executing that process takes time. So getting the signal from me to you

167
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:19,920
on the internet takes some time. So the environment's clock has to tick during that.

168
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:28,320
And all of these assumptions bundled together turn out to be a fairly serious set of assumptions.

169
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:34,800
And they involve assumptions about fine tuning, about the universe being just right.

170
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:43,360
And they should make us nervous. And I just want to leave it at that. We always assume

171
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:48,800
with complete aplomb that agents can communicate classically, but it's not a straightforward

172
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:55,200
assumption. And it's worth any of you are looking at, for interesting research projects,

173
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,640
can look into the nature of classical communication. It's full of hidden assumptions

174
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,600
and surprises and things that aren't at all straightforward, even though they look like

175
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:12,000
they ought to be. So there's a challenge. So why do we assume this? Why do we assume

176
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,840
classical communication? We do it because we have to, if we're going to talk about detecting

177
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:27,760
entanglement. And most of you probably know the history of the notion of entanglement.

178
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:35,840
It was first noticed by Einstein, Podolski, and Rosen ever after called EPR in 1935.

179
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:44,400
And they wrote a paper, which is infamous and called the EPR paper, in which they argued that

180
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,960
the phenomenon of entanglement made no sense and couldn't possibly be physical.

181
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:58,000
And since quantum theory included this notion of entanglement, it couldn't possibly be a complete

182
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:05,520
theory of what's going on in the world. And Schrodinger replied the same year with a very

183
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:11,200
detailed paper where he introduces among other things Schrodinger's cat as a paradox.

184
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:17,920
And he explains very clearly what entanglement is and why entanglement follows from quantum theory.

185
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:25,040
And he uses that discussion to argue that the classical notion of a physical state is not

186
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:30,640
actually applicable to the world as it is. So he answers the EPR paper very directly.

187
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:43,600
And this discussion is currently mostly known as the Bohr-Einstein debate because of course Bohr,

188
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:51,680
already in 1928, has said in print that the classical notion of causality in space and time

189
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:59,520
simply doesn't apply anymore. And Einstein objected to that vigorously. But that was 1935.

190
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:05,360
And it was almost 50 years later that entanglement was first observed in the laboratory. Here,

191
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:12,640
the 1982 picture is a picture of the interior of Alan Asbest laboratory when he performed

192
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,600
the first entanglement experiment for which he finally won the Nobel Prize last year.

193
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:27,360
And these days, this kind of experiment is done all over the world and is even done with

194
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:37,840
satellite-borne sources. Potential resource is the key to quantum security, quantum

195
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:44,400
security communication, as we'll discuss in quantum cryptography and quantum banking,

196
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,920
the quantum internet, all this other stuff that you may have heard of.

197
00:23:48,320 --> 00:24:00,160
So before talking more about these experiments, I just want to provide a definition of entanglement.

198
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:10,720
Entangled simply means not separable. That's the definition. So a state, a joint state,

199
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:19,040
a b is entangled if and only if it does not factor into two separable states.

200
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:29,280
And that's it. That's the definition. And the literature and especially the popular literature

201
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:36,080
are, is absolutely rife with hype and various kinds of misjurification of entanglement. And

202
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:44,080
authors trying to convince you that entanglement is this amazing kind of woo-woo thing.

203
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:51,920
And whenever you run across that, go back to the definition. I mean, entanglement simply means

204
00:24:52,880 --> 00:25:00,240
this simple mathematical condition of not separability or a state that isn't factorizable.

205
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,840
And that means that the state does not display classical conditional independence.

206
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:11,440
So classically, that's the way to think about it. It's a failure of conditional independence.

207
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:17,360
And it's ubiquitous in quantum theory, even though it wasn't actually hipster for almost

208
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:24,640
50 years after it was predicted. So here's what all these experiments look like. They're called

209
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:33,680
Bell EPR experiments after John Bell, who derived the statistical criterion for detecting entanglement.

210
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:40,560
And EPR, Einstein, Podolski, and Rosen, who did this as a thought experiment and said,

211
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:45,440
if this occurs in the theory, it can't possibly be real. And of course, it is real.

212
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:51,680
It's now amply demonstrated by experimentation. Here's how they work. There's a source.

213
00:25:52,640 --> 00:26:01,600
The source produces a state that is entangled. And I've written the typical what's called a Bell state.

214
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:07,280
It's up plus or minus down divided by the square root of 2, just to normalize it.

215
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:15,200
But up plus or minus down is clearly not the same as up times down. So this is not a separable state.

216
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:22,800
And this state propagates outward in space and time to two observers who have independent laboratories,

217
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:28,960
for example, on different continents in that space-based experiment that I showed you the picture

218
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:36,720
of from the cover of Science a few years ago, 2017, I think. The two observers have freedom

219
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:43,360
to choose their own reference frame, their own z-axis for measuring spin. They do a spin measurement,

220
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:50,640
and they do this over and over and over again. They accumulate statistics, and they exchange their

221
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:57,680
results so that they can analyze the joint statistics of their experiment, and they check to see

222
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:03,760
whether that joint statistics is consistent with classical probability theory. And if it isn't,

223
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:13,680
to a statistically significant level, then they've been able to detect entanglement.

224
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:22,160
Now, notice that this process requires classical communication. They have to make their independent

225
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:27,360
measurements in their own laboratories, and then they have to exchange results.

226
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:32,000
Or one of them has to send results to the other one, or they both have to send their results

227
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:39,680
to some third party. But in all of these cases, they're exchanging some classical data, and so we

228
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:45,920
have the assumption that whoever gets that classical data knows the language it was recorded in,

229
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:53,120
and so can do a joint analysis. So I'll just show you another picture of this experiment

230
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:59,360
that's in a standard space-time diagram. Here, time is vertical, space is horizontal.

231
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:08,080
The two observers are labeled Alice and Bob. They share a quantum channel

232
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,880
that goes from Alice to the source to Bob. That's the entangled state.

233
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:21,280
They do some processing, and then one of them here, Bob, sends the results to Alice,

234
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:27,280
and that's a classical communication. It takes time, and it traverses space.

235
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:35,440
So this step is classical. So this is why we have to assume classical communication to talk about

236
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:43,200
detecting or using entanglement. So now I want to represent this in a different way,

237
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:51,040
using our little picture earlier. We're going to think of Alice again as two components,

238
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:58,320
A1 and A2. They're separable, so they have to communicate classically. They have a classical

239
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:04,640
channel that goes through Bob, and they also now share some quantum channel. They share an

240
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:11,520
entangled state, and the entangled state, of course, is produced by Bob. The source is part of Bob,

241
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:18,880
and their detectors, if you want to think about it that way, are located on this boundary B,

242
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,560
or their interface with the source is on this boundary B,

243
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:30,720
and each of them executes a process that accumulates data from the quantum channel

244
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,480
and communicates it to the other observer via the classical channel.

245
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:42,320
Now this picture illustrates what's called a LOC protocol. LOC means local operations

246
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:49,840
in classical communication. So A1 and A2 are each operating locally on their boundary.

247
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:56,560
They're making measurements locally on their boundary, and they're communicating via actions

248
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:01,920
locally on their boundary and observations locally on their boundary. So for example,

249
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:10,400
I'm communicating with my computer here, we can consider it my boundary, and stuff is happening

250
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:16,960
in the environment that's implemented by the internet, and you're receiving those communications

251
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:22,560
locally on your boundary, on your laptop, or whatever it is you're using.

252
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:31,040
So that's what local operations means, and these protocols specifically involve classical

253
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:37,040
communication, and so they're able to detect entanglement. And a Bell EPR experiment is just

254
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:44,720
an example of a LOC protocol. The observers exchange information about how they're going

255
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:49,680
to do their experiments, they're both going to measure the spin, they're going to use independently

256
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:54,560
chosen reference frames, and they're going to look at the output from some agreed upon source.

257
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,760
So that's all classically set up, then they actually make their observations, and then

258
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:07,200
they classically communicate the results. So classical communication front and back.

259
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:19,280
LOC protocols are not limited to this sort of Bell EPR sort of setting. We can also represent

260
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:28,960
a scattering experiment as a LOC protocol. So here's a representation of scattering as a LOC

261
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:38,720
protocol, and you can see all I've done is cut that previous boundary out the division between

262
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:49,120
8.1 and 8.2, and I've then extended it in some external time, the time that is

263
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:59,040
counted by Bob's clock, not by Alice's clock, that's what's meant by external, and I've relabeled

264
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:07,840
Alice 2 as Alice 1 at a later time. So now what Alice is doing is communicating with her past self,

265
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:15,920
or A1 is communicating with her future self, and they're each doing something different.

266
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:24,160
A1 is executing a procedure that in the laboratory we call state preparation.

267
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:32,160
She's preparing a state that we'll call N, which is just the initial state of some

268
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:41,120
scattering experiment. So for example, at the LHC, N is some state of two protons that are

269
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:50,320
quartering around the ring at the LHC at close to the speed of light, and Alice then later on

270
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:58,000
at t plus delta t is doing a different kind of quantum process. She's analyzing the data

271
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:05,440
coming out of something like the Atlas detector, which is a multi-particle counter that's located

272
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:13,520
at the LHC. So they share a quantum channel, which is the scattering channel that takes the

273
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:23,120
incoming state and produces the outgoing state, and I recall from the very first session, as Feynman

274
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:30,880
told us, to understand this transition from N to out, we have to integrate over all possible paths

275
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:39,440
that are consistent with conservation of spin-holicity, basically momentum plus spin.

276
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:46,480
All the different spins that are relevant in a high-energy physics experiment,

277
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,320
including things like lepton number, which is basically a spin.

278
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:58,720
Now, how do we know? How do we know what we have to conserve? We know what we have to conserve

279
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:06,160
because Alice is doing the experiment, has a classical memory that allows her to remember

280
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:14,960
what she prepared. She can remember that what she did back in the past was set to protons

281
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:21,280
counter-rotating in the LHC, and they had certain energies, and so they had certain momenta,

282
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:27,600
and they were protons, so they had certain spin variables. All of that has to be remembered to

283
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:37,760
make any sense of the output of the detectors, and so to actually come up with a measured state

284
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:48,000
that makes sense. Very often, this memory channel is neglected by physicists, and I'm going to pause

285
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:56,160
here and let Andrew ask a question. Thank you, Chris. Does this imply that every time you have a

286
00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:02,640
block channel, the quantum part is like a scattering picture, like a unitary evolution,

287
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:08,640
even in the earlier EPR picture. Is that quantum channel portion always a unitary evolution

288
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:22,560
scattering picture? Thank you. Yes, for essentially the reason that I'll define the classical

289
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,680
channel, you're always assuming you have something that's protected from decoherence.

290
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:35,280
By the environment. So, yeah, if you're doing an EPR experiment, you have to assume that you

291
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:40,320
don't have any environmental decoherence between the source and the detectors,

292
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:48,160
and similarly, when you're doing a scattering experiment, you have to make the assumption

293
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:55,600
that the environment is not reaching in there and messing with the outgoing state that you're

294
00:35:55,600 --> 00:36:00,320
going to see or reaching in and messing with the incoming state and changing it in some way

295
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:06,320
that re-prepares it in a way that you don't know, that you have no knowledge of.

296
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:13,600
So, yes, you're making a fairly strong anti-decoherence assumption in any of these settings when you're

297
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:21,840
talking about having a quantum channel. Does that answer the question? Yes, thank you.

298
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:29,680
Okay, great. So, we can think of, we can think of LOC, we can think of scattering as LOC.

299
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:41,520
And I just wanted to now emphasize that effectively what LOC is implementing is two

300
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:48,240
parallel memories, a classical memory, which as we said in the case of scattering is memory for

301
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:56,160
preparation. In the EPR case, it's memory for preparation for what the experimental setup is,

302
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:04,240
for what the instructions for doing the experiment are. And we also have a quantum channel,

303
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:10,000
which is effectively another memory. It's something that's extended through time,

304
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:17,600
and again, it's implemented by the environment, implemented by Bob, and it involves Bob's clock

305
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:27,680
ticking. So, whenever we have two memories in parallel, we can construct an error-correcting

306
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:34,800
code. So, think of a simple classical error-correcting code, for example, the use of parity bits

307
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:44,000
in exchanging digital data. So, if I send you a bit string, classically, and I send it to you

308
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:51,760
two or three times, so there's some redundancy in my signal, and I send you a parity bit.

309
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:58,720
I say, okay, add up your bit string, and the result should be one. It's one on my side.

310
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:05,840
If you've added up and you get zero, there's an error someplace. You can use that parity bit to

311
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:13,280
detect errors. So, you can throw out the bit strings that you receive that have parity as zero

312
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,920
and say, oh, the environment interfered somehow with the signal, or some eavesdropper interfered

313
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,920
with the signal and made a mistake, or something like that. So, this corresponds

314
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:31,120
to environmental decoherence not being a good assumption, even though it's classical. Environmental

315
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:37,920
interference is not a good assumption in this case. So, a quantum error-correcting code is

316
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:46,160
basically the same idea. I use some feature of the fact that I have two different memories,

317
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:57,600
and that I'm encoding something in time, I'm encoding multiple replicates of something in time,

318
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:04,720
to provide a way of checking to make sure that I'm sending the correct message.

319
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:14,240
So, I can, for example, consider the message to be my classical memory,

320
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:23,520
and consider the quantum process as a process that tests that memory. So, I remember that I

321
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:32,560
need to do experiment X, and I will get result Y. I actually do experiment X on this quantum channel

322
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:41,280
and see if I get result Y. And if I don't get result Y, then something's wrong. Either I can't

323
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:50,320
trust the quantum channel, or I've remembered my preparation conditions incorrectly. So, I'm

324
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:56,560
using one memory to check the accuracy of the other. And this problem

325
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:04,960
of using something about the environment, some channel in the environment, to check memory

326
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:13,600
is absolutely ubiquitous, and we use it all the time. So, for example, look around your room,

327
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:21,440
and your room hopefully looks more or less the same now that it did at the start of this session.

328
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:30,720
And that's very reassuring. It reassures you that something's not happening in the environment

329
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:41,120
that's dangerous and disturbing. And if you couldn't do that, if your environment was constantly

330
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:47,120
changing, and there was no familiarity about the environment, you wouldn't be able to check your

331
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:53,680
memory. You wouldn't be able to check your sanity. So, even though we don't think about

332
00:40:54,880 --> 00:41:00,480
our local environments as effectively an error correcting code, that's exactly how we use it.

333
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:06,560
We use the emerging memory or memory out there in the environment as a way of checking our own

334
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:16,560
memories and assuring that our memory is okay. So, I talked a little bit about quantum security.

335
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:25,280
Here's how quantum security system works. Again, it's a lock protocol. We have some classical

336
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:34,560
signal that can be thought of as a code or a key or a one-time pad, for example,

337
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:42,720
that encodes a way of doing experiments. And once that's been exchanged, assuming it's secure,

338
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:50,720
then we can use the quantum channel to communicate information. And the classical channel has told

339
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:56,320
us what we have to do with that quantum channel. We have to make certain kinds of measurements

340
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:06,160
at, say, particular clock times as measured, and we'll get information sent from the past,

341
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:17,280
from the sender. And the classical channel protects the quantum channel from adversarial agents,

342
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:24,400
because anything that an adversarial agent does to the quantum channel, if some agent

343
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:29,760
tries to eavesdrop, for example, on the quantum channel, they'll disrupt the quantum channel,

344
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:37,920
and the results of our measurement will not be what's expected given the protocol that we run,

345
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:47,200
that we have run. So quantum communication is secured by the fact that interfering with some

346
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:54,480
entangled state actually destroys the state, so it's detectable. We can always know if someone is

347
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:59,840
trying to disrupt our communications, which isn't true if we just have two classical channels.

348
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:05,760
Charlie can always intercept a message and then recreate it, and that's not possible

349
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:17,760
with a quantum channel. So let's refold this diagram so that we've taken the external time

350
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:26,960
back out of it. And we have this picture where the two components of Alice are just interacting

351
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:33,600
via their shared boundary with their environment, Bob. And now we can see that the source of

352
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:42,720
redundancy is not time, it's the boundary itself. Just sharing the boundary allows

353
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:53,520
Alice's components, A1 and A2, to put copies of the same information on different places

354
00:43:53,520 --> 00:44:00,400
on the boundary. So the boundary now becomes a resource for redundant storage of information.

355
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:06,640
So Alice 1 and Alice 2 can use different parts of the boundary

356
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:16,560
to check what other parts of the boundary say, to check the information that's encoded on other

357
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:23,680
parts of the boundary. So they can define an error correcting code on the boundary itself

358
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:39,600
using this lock protocol. So I just want to leave you with this idea that using classical and quantum

359
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:49,680
channels together allows us to define error correcting codes on boundaries that we share

360
00:44:50,000 --> 00:45:03,280
as separate agents. And leave you to think about what shared measurements, what shared

361
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:15,200
quantum reference frames, let us as agents see the same things. And this is what we'll talk about

362
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:26,000
next time in September. We'll talk specifically about how space provides us with an error correcting

363
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:37,280
code and try to understand why space is treated as emergent from something else, basically,

364
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:46,000
from communication in most of quantum gravity. So thank you very much. I encourage you to use

365
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:53,360
the interactive QA and to attend the discussion sessions and we'll see you in September. Thank you.

366
00:45:54,320 --> 00:46:08,720
Awesome. Chris, thank you for the lecture. Andrew, do you have any remarks or questions?

367
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:16,880
Not right now. Thank you. I'll just ask a few quick questions and if anyone has one quickly

368
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:24,400
in the live chat. So you mentioned the tick of the clock and in active inference, we often hold

369
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:31,040
up side by side both the discrete time models and the continuous time models. So do clocks have to

370
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:40,880
tick discreetly or how do we think about continuous time modeling? In this in this quantum setting,

371
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:46,240
they do have to tick discreetly because one has to be able to distinguish

372
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:53,600
Alice's preparation of the qubits on her boundary from Bob's measurements of the

373
00:46:54,480 --> 00:47:05,440
qubits on the boundary. And this process can be extremely fast with respect to any kind of sense

374
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:14,560
of macroscopic time. You know, your eyes are responding to photons in I think it's hundreds

375
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:25,440
of femtoseconds. So the discrete transitions that are effectively time measurements for you

376
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:33,280
are at that very fast molecular time scale, much, much faster than our typical clocks.

377
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:41,440
When we try to do very fast timing, we're constructing a faster clock than that,

378
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:45,440
but it's a clock that we can only observe indirectly.

379
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:57,680
Awesome. Okay. Now this one maybe connects a little bit to application, but with all the

380
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:04,320
developments happening in theory, some of which you're reviewing here, and also in practice with

381
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:11,920
quantum computation, and then keeping in mind this distinction. Sorry, I've lost you. Back.

382
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:24,160
I've lost you, Daniel. Okay, we'll wait till you're back. I can see you. No. Okay. Yeah,

383
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:31,280
just repeat your question, please. Yeah, so given these rapid and ongoing developments in

384
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:36,480
theory and practice related to quantum information science and quantum information security,

385
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:45,120
how are people using this distinction of the classical Stigmergic memory and then the

386
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:49,040
quantum cognitive process to anticipate

387
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:56,960
how to develop information systems that are reliable going forward?

388
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:10,880
I don't know of any instances in which thinking about quantum cognition has entered directly into

389
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:20,240
any design of communication systems. The ability of humans to interact with these systems is just

390
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:29,120
assumed. So it's just assumed that the user can interact with, say, a computer interface,

391
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:36,640
which is the sort of interface that will be provided or is provided to any quantum computer.

392
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:43,920
So if you think about a quantum computer, a practical quantum computer, it has classical

393
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:53,440
interfaces front and back. So in thinking about interacting with the computer, I'm giving it some

394
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:59,760
classical problem statement, for example, and asking for some classical answer. And what it's

395
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:06,880
going to give me is a probability distribution of classical answers. But I can, by running the

396
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:11,040
calculation many times, make that probability distribution fairly tight.

397
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:22,160
So yeah, I don't know of anyone talking about quantum BCIs at this point. It'd be an interesting

398
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:34,640
question. Was it always understood these sorts of blind spots and axioms associated with classical

399
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:45,680
communication? Was it developed as kind of like a proposal or like a special case? And more unpacking

400
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:50,640
was left for later? Or are these blind spots things that we're now coming into awareness of,

401
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:53,760
given what we're learning in the quantum information sciences?

402
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:02,560
I think we're learning how serious they are. But they were certainly recognized even by Bohr

403
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:12,880
in his 1928 paper. And that's a very good paper, too. It's called the present state of quantum

404
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:18,960
theory or something like that, and it's in nature. And it's available on the web somewhere.

405
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:29,280
I have a copy of it. But it was written, in a sense, as Bohr's summary of the 1927 Solvay

406
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:34,480
conference, which was the conference at which everyone doing quantum theory at that time

407
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:45,040
got together to talk about their results. And in it, Bohr essentially presents what came to be

408
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:56,400
the Copenhagen interpretation, which I think is probably unfairly called an interpretation.

409
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:06,640
And it's sort of the Copenhagen pragmatic stance toward quantum theory. And essentially what Bohr

410
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:16,880
says is that if we're going to do science, we have to assume that people can talk to each other.

411
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:24,960
And if we're going to do science, we have to assume that there are instruments that we can

412
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:33,120
manipulate and have reasonable confidence that we know what manipulation we've done. So if I turn

413
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:39,920
a knob from one to two, I have to be reasonably confident that I'm making a particular change

414
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:49,280
that I can understand. And we have to have reasonable confidence that different laboratories can

415
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:55,920
replicate the same experiment. And if we think about any of those assumptions in purely quantum

416
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:03,680
theoretic terms, then all sorts of questions are raised, right? Every quantum system is unique.

417
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:11,600
We have the no cloning theorem. So every scientific instrument is unique. So there's no such thing as

418
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:19,680
exactly replicating an experiment, right? That's a coarse-grained description of what I've done

419
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:27,520
with a completely unique quantum system. And my brain, of course, is unique. And yours is too,

420
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:36,480
and everyone else's is. So talking about a sharing a language is essentially a coarse-grained assumption.

421
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:44,800
And what the Copenhagen stance is all about is coarse-graining, yielding, effective classicality.

422
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:52,160
Or what that really means is coarse-graining, yielding, a description that we can use in

423
00:53:52,160 --> 00:54:00,800
the language that we understand. So these are very, very old issues that have been recognized for a

424
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:07,760
long time. But I think, in part, because of the disaster of shut up and calculate,

425
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:11,840
they haven't really been talked about in the classroom.

426
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:20,400
Awesome. I'll just read short questions from the chat. We can just, we can pass them to the

427
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:25,440
discussion section, but there's a lot of great diverse questions. So Alexi wrote.

428
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,680
I think I've lost you again. The Revenge of Zoom.

429
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:35,040
Well, we looked at the chart earlier where like Bob was talking to Alice,

430
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:38,400
the unidirectional communication. Okay, good.

431
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:45,120
Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. The unidirectional. The third party is recording it, I'm sure.

432
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:53,840
Alexi wrote regarding the environment for being used for error correction. A symptom of

433
00:54:53,840 --> 00:55:00,720
derealization in psychological trauma breakdown. We don't recognize the environment around us and

434
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:10,720
it's scary. Makes sense. Makes sense. All right. From Bala. Nice presentation. I heard Chris say,

435
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:17,920
entangled states are LOCC for a specific reference frame. Is this entanglement unitary or

436
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:21,200
is it related to the numbers of degrees of freedom?

437
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:35,440
I think the quick answer would be both. If you have a complex system with many

438
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:43,920
degrees of freedom, some can be entangled while others aren't. It depends on what parts of the

439
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:49,920
state are separable. So again, entanglement is just a statement about

440
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:57,040
components of a joint state that factor or don't.

441
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:04,240
So you can have a joint state that looks separable along some dimensions, but

442
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:10,320
other dimensions. The other big complication here is that

443
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:16,640
whether a state looks entangled depends on the reference frames that you use to measure it with.

444
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:26,400
And if you pick entangled reference frames, then what we ordinarily think of as separable

445
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:30,880
does entangled states become separable. So you can move entanglement around.

446
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:40,560
Awesome. Okay. From Roland Rodriguez. Is the discrete temporality only within the context

447
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:46,000
of a given holographic screen interface? With time being bracketed otherwise,

448
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,880
beyond interface systems is continuity or discretion kept agnostic?

449
00:56:54,880 --> 00:57:03,040
I think if I understand the question correctly, it's yes. If I don't draw any boundaries,

450
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:13,760
I just have the joint state, then the evolution is unitary. And in a sense, time plays no role.

451
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:23,520
And if unitary evolution is perfectly time symmetric, so time actually drops out altogether.

452
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,320
Awesome. So to talk about time, we have to draw boundaries.

453
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:37,440
Awesome. Time must have a stop. And I'll ask one last question from the appropriately

454
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:44,880
monocled question quanderer. All communication is abductive. Is a sentiment that I've been

455
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:51,280
using to develop some arguments? Does that scan for you? How do we connect what we're discussing

456
00:57:51,280 --> 00:58:04,000
here with quantum to abductive logic? Yeah. I could go along with that. I want a lot more detail.

457
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:11,920
All communication is essentially analogical. I would agree with that. Yes.

458
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:22,960
Andrew? Yes, thank you. So going back to the picture where the scattering picture,

459
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:31,920
so we have so far everything is topological and certainly induces breaking the boundary

460
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:37,920
in different sectors. I suppose it induces a topology on the boundary. Now, I have a couple

461
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:46,000
questions asked for the geometry, and this might be getting ahead. Is it an emerging property of

462
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:51,840
those channels between different boundary sectors? And if that's the case, then what does it mean to

463
00:58:51,840 --> 00:59:06,160
have a QRF for space? Yeah, this is really the topic for September. But you do point out the

464
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:14,560
fact that it's something of a chicken and egg situation. The way I think of it is I suppose

465
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:24,720
to choose the chicken side and think about what kind of reference frame does the agent have to

466
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:35,600
implement to see space on their boundary? And the reason I think about it that way is

467
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:41,280
that's a question I want to be able to ask about biological systems. And this actually gets into

468
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:49,520
probably what won't be talked about until October. But I want to be able to ask

469
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:59,600
essentially a phylogenetic question of what sorts of organisms, where in the lineage from Luca,

470
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:08,560
do we find systems that are able to assign spatial coordinates to their boundaries?

471
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:20,080
And what coordinates come first? And I suspect that sort of discrete location names with no metric

472
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:28,160
come first. That a system can talk about, for example, this part of their membrane versus

473
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:33,600
that part of their membrane without even having any ability to say how far apart they are.

474
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:40,320
That some sort of metric representation of this angular space comes later.

475
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:50,240
And that a radial space comes even later than that. That's at this point speculation. But I

476
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:55,920
think these are questions that we can end up asking given the right kind of formalism

477
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:01,920
and the right understanding of what it means to be able to make a spatial measurement.

478
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:09,680
So the conjecture is that the metric would emerge from a discrete network metric of counting ticks

479
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:18,480
sort of thing? Yeah, I think that's correct. And the sort of cemeteries of space that we see

480
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:27,760
are very much tied up with object identity. So if we think about something like rotational symmetry,

481
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:35,680
let's see. I should stop screen sharing.

482
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:46,320
So I've got this object, right? And I can do this and I say, oh, the space has this rotational

483
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:52,480
symmetry. But for me to say that, I have to recognize that this is the same object, right?

484
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:59,200
I have to implement object persistence, which we all learn to do when we're nine months old or

485
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:09,520
something. But we tend to regard those as separate things as, you know, we learn object persistence

486
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:15,280
because space is rotationally symmetric. But we can view it the other way around that space is

487
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:22,000
rotationally symmetric for me, because I implement these constraints that are called object persistence.

488
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:32,000
Do you think we can understand phylogenetics as a whole, as a kind of scattering experiment,

489
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:40,720
like the high energy Luca event, and then dissipating and propagating in a very tangled bank?

490
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:49,440
Well, I do want to be able to understand phylogeny in exactly the same terms as embryology.

491
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:54,400
And Mike Levin and I have published papers about that. We should be able to view the

492
01:02:54,400 --> 01:03:01,520
lineage of Luca in exactly the same way that, you know, we view the lineage of the zygote that produced us.

493
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:10,960
So that's why it's no coincidence that during pregnancy, the development of the embryo

494
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:14,880
mirrors evolution in terms of the parts that are developed first?

495
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:23,360
Yeah, this is the old idea that phylogenia and ontogenia are related in some way,

496
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:30,320
which from an embryonic development point of view, they're certainly analogous in ways.

497
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:36,480
And sorry, if I may ask one last question, I think it should be very quick.

498
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:42,480
Regarding the weak rotation, I'm still a bit unsure of how it ties to this

499
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:48,080
diagrammatic notation that we had with quantum channels and so on.

500
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:55,200
And there was a note in the second session, we briefly talked about the weak rotation,

501
01:03:56,160 --> 01:04:02,480
you know, being a reversal in the direction of time. Is there any relation to today's session?

502
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:18,480
Yeah, whenever we think about the flow of time as driven by the input output cycle,

503
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:28,400
the input output cycle for agents separated by a boundary is always, there's always a sign

504
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:37,120
change, right? My input is your output and vice versa. So when we think about the

505
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:50,480
Bob's clock ticking when Alice does something, his direction of time, in a sense,

506
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:54,240
points with respect to the boundary opposite to hers.

507
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:03,520
But that's only with respect to the boundary. He sees information flowing in and she sees

508
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:12,080
information flowing in. That's the only point being made here about the weak rotation as an

509
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:24,080
operation. Thank you, Chris. Very well appreciated by the viewers and by us. So we'll certainly

510
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:31,680
look forward to reviewing the Q&A and everybody is welcome and encouraged to join for the

511
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:37,840
participatory discussion in about two weeks on Saturday. So till next time.

512
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:41,680
All right. Thank you. Cheers.

513
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:03,060
you
