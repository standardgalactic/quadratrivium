32000	36060	Opport.
36060	55520	Hello, everyone. Welcome to ActonFlab livestream 25.0. Today is July first 2021. And we're going to be talking about this paper, the computational boundary of a self. Developmental bio-electricity drives multi-cellularity and scale-free cognition.
55520	58700	I'm blue, and I'm here with Daniel. bill.
58700	59960	Awesome.
59960	71960	So, welcome to the Active Inference Lab, everyone. We are a participatory online lab that is communicating, learning and practicing applied active inference.
71960	81960	You can find us at the links here on this page. This is a recorded and archived live stream, so please provide us with feedback so that we can improve our work.
81960	87960	All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome here. We will be following good video etiquette for live streams.
88960	96960	Here at the short link, you'll find all of the live streams and different series that we do in the communications unit of the Active Inference Lab.
96960	116960	And today, we're doing the contextualizing paper, the .0 video for two upcoming discussions in the first half of July 2021 on the 6th and the 13th, when we have discussions 25.1 and 25.2 on this paper and hopefully the author joining.
117960	125960	Today, in Active Lab live stream 25.0, we're going to be trying to set some context and give an introduction to the following paper.
125960	133960	The computational boundary of a self, developmental bioelectricity drives multicellularity and scale-free cognition by Mike Levin.
133960	138960	And this video is just an introduction to some of the ideas. It's not a review or a final word.
138960	148960	It's kind of like a three-way intersection where we have people who might be within the Active Inference community looking to be exposed to some different areas like developmental biology or cognitive science.
148960	156960	And then another group of people who are coming from the developmental biology or cognitive science background and curious about active inference.
156960	165960	And then also we hope that this is exciting and interesting even for people who are not familiar with active inference or developmental biology or cognitive science.
166960	172960	We will hopefully try to connect it with some broader questions.
172960	188960	So we're going to walk through some of the aims and claims of the paper, the abstract and the roadmap and bring a few big questions and some key points of the paper so that whether you read the paper or not, you'll hopefully be in a good spot to ask questions and learn more.
188960	200960	And of course in the .1 and .2 videos in the coming weeks we'll be discussing the same paper. So save and submit your questions and let us know if you'd like to participate or contribute in any way.
200960	212960	So here we are on the paper itself. That's a screenshot of the cover and the aims and claims and I'll read them so that then Daniel you can give a first thought on what you thought was cool or what you thought was important about the paper.
212960	214960	So the aims and claims of the paper.
215960	226960	First, they define individuals and selves in a way that facilitates taxonomy, comparison and communication with evolved, created biological, artificial and exobiological agents.
226960	241960	He says, I propose a fundamental definition of an individual based on the ability to pursue goals at an appropriate level of scale and organization and suggest a formalism for defining and comparing the cognitive capacities of highly diverse types of agents.
242960	254960	Second, he proposes a plausible naturalistic framework for the evolutionary scale-up of cognition from the earliest origins of life, hypothesizing about the forces that drove it and the major transitions along the continuum.
254960	262960	And the goal of this research program is to show how complex agency and goal-directedness evolves naturally from ancient mechanisms.
262960	264960	So Daniel, what do you think about that?
266960	267960	Nice work.
267960	279960	Well, I thought the paper was pretty exciting because it touches on just so many big topics like goal-setting and agency, cognition and natural and artificial systems, multi-scale systems.
279960	292960	And then it links it in a way that people might not expect, which is through developmental biology and bioelectricity, which are kind of like processes that these life forms or other forms engage in.
292960	309960	So to be able to connect things that are awesome about systems that matter, like, again, their goal-seeking nature, their ability to do cognition, and then connect that to a process theory, it's kind of what we're all about in active inference, connecting the cool features of the world to process theories that are tractable.
309960	310960	Cool.
310960	315960	So moving on to the abstract, I'll read the first part and then you can read the next slide.
315960	321960	So all epistemic agents physically consist of parts that must somehow comprise an integrated cognitive self.
321960	330960	Biological individuals consist of subunits, organs, cells and molecular networks that are themselves complex and competent in their own native contexts.
331960	337960	How do coherent biological individuals result from the activity of smaller subagents?
337960	352960	To understand the evolution and function of metazone creatures, bodies and minds, it is essential to conceptually explore the origin of multicellularity and the scaling of basal cognition of individual cells into a coherent, larger organism.
352960	365960	So I find this line of research truly fascinating and really a burning question for me is how information is consolidated or prioritized across scales, whether it's coarse-graining or salience or something else.
365960	367960	So do you want to read the next part?
367960	371960	Yep, just one thought on that and it's going to be a theme that's returned to.
371960	378960	It's that cognition or agency doesn't just blink into existence at a larger level of analysis.
378960	390960	It's actually composed of smaller cognitive units and so it's kind of like cognition all the way down that helps us integrate across scales but also recognize what's special about larger levels of organization like culture.
390960	393960	So part two of the abstract.
393960	406960	In this article, I synthesize ideas in cognitive science, evolutionary biology and developmental physiology towards a hypothesis about the origin of individuality, scale-free cognition.
406960	422960	I propose a fundamental definition of an individual based upon the ability to pursue goals at an appropriate level of scale and organization and suggest a formalism for defining and comparing the cognitive capacities of highly diverse types of agents.
422960	431960	Any self is demarcated by a computational surface, the spatial temporal boundary of events that it can measure, model and try to affect.
431960	439960	The surface sets a functional boundary, a cognitive light cone, which defines the scale and limits of its cognition.
439960	456960	I hypothesize that higher level goal directed activity and agency resulting in larger cognitive boundaries evolves from the primal homeostatic drive of living things to reduce stress, the difference between current conditions and life optimal conditions.
456960	472960	So I like this goal directed like aspect of this and it really kind of implies to me that the it's like biological cognition has to be biological but I wonder about like, you know what is the goal of molecules in their like organization right is that
472960	484960	like a goal directed activity like the protons and neutrons and electrons want to like reduce their uncertainty about where they are in space or how does it work at like a non biological level makes me wonder that.
484960	500960	Or strain strain and stress, those are things we psychologically experienced but then you can have you know like a ring with four carbons it's under strain and the carbons they seek to do what well get into a less stressed position like a unstrained arrangement.
500960	525960	For sure. The next part, the mechanisms of developmental bio electricity, the ability of all cells to form electrical networks the process information suggest a plausible set of gradual evolutionary steps that naturally lead from physiological homeostasis in single cells to memory prediction and ultimately complex cognitive agents via scale up of the basic drive of info taxes.
525960	540960	Recent data on the molecular mechanisms of pre neuro bio electricity suggest a model of how increasingly sophisticated cognitive functions emerge smoothly from cell to cell communication used to guide embryogenesis and regeneration.
540960	559960	This set of hypotheses provides a novel perspective on numerous phenomena, such as cancer and makes several unique testable predictions for interdisciplinary research that have implications not only for evolutionary developmental biology, but also for bio medicine and perhaps artificial intelligence and exo biology.
559960	563960	Do you have any thoughts on that Daniel.
563960	573960	I guess it's just cool to see development and cognition come on to equal grounding because there was ecology evolution and development eco evo divo.
573960	583960	And then it's sort of that's natural things happening and then often cognition and especially computational perspectives on cognition are seen as unnatural or designed.
583960	594960	And so again, all of these pieces are going to be woven together with a few pieces like bio electricity and light cones that maybe people aren't expecting.
594960	595960	Cool.
595960	602960	So the roadmap of the paper, we're going to go through the introduction, then the papers broken up into lots of different parts.
602960	603960	What is a self?
603960	612960	How do you define an individual body patterning cognition multi cellularity versus cancer defining individuation from a cognitive perspective.
612960	621960	The agents evolutionary backstory conclusion future outlook discussion and then some predictions and research program.
621960	628960	And then in the end, what does it feel like to be a pancreas, which I renamed that part, but maybe you changed it back.
628960	629960	So we'll see.
629960	632960	Do you want to read over the keywords.
632960	645960	Here's the provided keywords were development bio electricity and the related gap junctions primitive cognition and our favorite active inference.
645960	652960	So development, I like this quote from Seth Smith, Seth, Mary and Maynard Smith, which I can never say yours is last name.
652960	653960	I feel bad.
653960	661960	Sorry, yours developmental biology can be seen as the study of how information in the genome is translated into the adult structure.
661960	666960	And evolutionary biology of how the information came to be there in the first place.
666960	669960	So that's a kind of cool definition of development.
669960	672960	Do you have any thoughts on that?
672960	680960	It reminds me of earlier discussions we had about Tim Bergen's for wise, which are kind of related to Aristotle's for wise.
680960	682960	It's like, why is there a foot?
682960	686960	Well, the easy sort of material answers because there's matter in the shape of a foot.
686960	689960	But maybe you want to know something that's historical.
689960	695960	And over really long periods of time, it's a story about evolution, how the foot came to be selected on through time.
695960	703960	But development is just right there in the middle where it's the story for that individual, how that foot came to be.
703960	706960	Thanks said, blue, could you turn down my mic?
706960	709960	It apparently is a little louder distorted.
709960	710960	Thank you for the feedback.
710960	717960	Yeah, if anybody has comments on like the audio, blue is doing an awesome job of first broadcaster role.
717960	718960	Cool.
718960	719960	All right.
719960	722960	Hopefully that's a little bit better.
722960	725960	All right.
725960	726960	Bioelectricity.
726960	729960	So this is a quote from the paper.
729960	737960	Developmental bioelectricity is the ubiquitous exchange of slowly changing ion based voltage signals within and among cells.
737960	746960	All cells are electrically active and modern neurons evolved from preneural precursors that were already reaping the benefits of ionic signaling for competition.
746960	748960	Computation.
748960	750960	Ionic signaling for computation.
750960	752960	So there's some ion channels.
752960	756960	I like that cool, like digital image of ion channels and cells.
756960	764960	And of course, this painting by Alex Gray, like isn't officially bioelectricity, but whenever I think of the word bioelectricity, I always think of this picture.
764960	766960	Do you have any thoughts?
766960	774960	And to connect the developmental aspect to what is mentioned here about the cells being electrically active.
774960	778960	The neural tissue arises during development from neuroectoderm.
778960	785960	So before there was sort of an inner layer of these electrically specialized cells, the ones that we call neurons.
785960	793960	There was an outer layer and we see that recapitulated in embryogenesis when the neural tube is closed.
793960	806960	So that's combining sort of ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny, which is just to say that the development of the organism carries some resonance with the way that the organism evolved through time.
806960	812960	And then just to remind that every cell has those pumps that maintain charge.
812960	824960	All of them are involved in rapid fire signaling, but to maintain ionic gradients and therefore bioelectric gradients is essentially what cells do with their membranes.
824960	828960	Cool, and awesome segue into talking about gap junctions.
828960	832960	So this is like something that's near and dear to my heart with my neuroscience background.
832960	837960	So gap junctions were originally attributed to neurons.
837960	843960	Like gap junctions are there at the synapse and they facilitate the electrical signaling between neural cells.
843960	849960	But really they're channels that permit cell to cell transfer of ions directly.
849960	857960	And they were originally described in nerve and muscle, but they're really found in virtually all cells that are present in solid tissues.
857960	865960	And then I just did a quick like brief look up of a recent review of gap junctions and it's cool like they're involved in all kinds of things, right?
865960	879960	Like so cell proliferation, immune response, migration, optosis, carcinogenesis, hyper proliferative skin disorders, lymphatic vessel diseases, inflammatory lung diseases that's like asthma, liver injury and neoplastic disorders.
879960	881960	That's also cancer.
881960	885960	So I thought that that was kind of a neat thing.
885960	888960	Any thoughts on this one, Daniel?
888960	894960	Just that active inference helps us think about how agents communicate and interact.
894960	901960	So if there's two cells and they have totally disjoint membranes, then they can both modify a niche in common.
901960	907960	So they could pump ions in and out of the fluid like the extracellular matrix that's surrounding the cells.
907960	909960	So there's a common niche that they're sharing.
909960	911960	That's like the least connected they could be.
911960	917960	And then there are also ways in which they can have a long term connection with a higher throughput.
917960	933960	So we're seeing a lot of these ideas of communication where we can talk about these two agents now directly exchanging information with each other as their electrochemical niche rather than just jointly modifying the shared fluid that they're in.
933960	935960	Cool.
935960	942960	Okay, next.
942960	945960	All right, primitive cognition.
945960	949960	Let's see if I can play this video. Did you want me to play it?
949960	951960	Sure, if it works on your side.
951960	954960	Let's see it.
954960	958960	Perfect.
958960	964960	Role of actin and cell motility, stunning 3D animation.
964960	969960	Maybe we don't need the sound.
969960	984960	Well, what is written in the paper is the emerging field known as basal cognition tracks the evolutionary history of learning and decision making processes beginning from the dynamic problem solving capacities of cellular and subcellular forms.
984960	998960	Many examples of memory, anticipation, context dependent decision making and learning are exhibited by organisms from yeast and bacteria to plants and somatic cells.
999960	1004960	So down at the bottom, what does cognition or intelligent behavior look like across scales?
1004960	1010960	Where and how does cognition arise and how does it develop or evolve convergent and divergent features?
1010960	1015960	And where does active inference come into play?
1015960	1033960	I think that first question is fun because it's a little easy to off the cuff just say, well, I don't recognize the intelligence of a cell because it's not, you know, doing an undergrad course, or it's not doing skillful performance like we talked about in a previous discussion.
1033960	1040960	So will we have a human centric conception of intelligence tied up with all of our cultural understandings?
1040960	1046960	Or is there something about intelligent behavior that might help us recognize it across scales?
1046960	1052960	And that's what turns us to these fundamentals like memory, anticipation, context dependent decision making.
1053960	1060960	And then once we open up to that functional level of intelligent behavior and cognition, we start seeing it everywhere.
1060960	1071960	And so instead of just seeing these cells and their behavior as taking part of an intelligent system that again only blinks into existence at the top level, they're in and of themselves intelligent actors.
1073960	1074960	Awesome.
1083960	1085960	The video got me locked in here, sorry.
1088960	1090960	How about that? You want to take us through that slide, Daniel?
1091960	1094960	Yep, so it's written in the paper.
1094960	1099960	I propose, well, we'll come back to, I'll give you a second.
1099960	1109960	At the top, it's written, developmental bio electricity is the ubiquitous exchange of slowly changing ion based voltage signals within and among cells.
1109960	1114960	All cells are electric electrically active, and we talked about that just a few slides ago.
1114960	1116960	How ancient are these mechanisms?
1116960	1120960	How early was bioelectric coordination exploited by evolution?
1120960	1127960	So this is raising the notion that early cognition was biomechanical, it was biophysical.
1127960	1138960	It involved morphological computation like we saw on the previous slide with the movie of cells, but also electrical affordances existed from the beginning.
1138960	1156960	And so if biophysical affordances existed from the beginning and allowed for cognition to arise, then it makes just as much sense to say that electrical affordances for cells to communicate and do these types of cognitive processes also were exploited very early in evolution.
1157960	1169960	So primitive, meaning at a smaller level, but also earlier on, and suggesting that it's bioelectric was one of the earlier mechanisms of cognition is pretty cool.
1171960	1185960	And I like this quote from the paper that says the ability to operate toward a region and state space may be the primitive origin of complex cognitive systems that can entertain counterfactuals, which is to remember or anticipate events that are not occurring right now.
1185960	1189960	So we'll touch back on homeostasis, but how are the goals related to homeostasis?
1189960	1192960	How does bioelectricity play a role in homeostasis?
1192960	1194960	And I think we come back around to that.
1199960	1208960	On 17, I wanted to give an example about where bioelectricity and development came together with cognition.
1208960	1215960	And for some people, genetic reductionism makes it so that, you know, the story is not complete until we know what gene is involved.
1215960	1237960	And I think that they'd find this recent 2021 paper from Drosophila fruit flies to be really interesting, because what they do with a series of experiments is actually demonstrate the importance of membrane depolarization, which is to say bioelectric capacity in gene regulatory networks.
1237960	1250960	So like H H and PTC are proteins that are produced by loci and DNA, and they're part of feedback loops involving the depolarization of membranes.
1250960	1261960	So they show that regulation of that membrane potential has an important role in signaling hedgehog and that there's a mutually reinforcing relationship between these two processes.
1261960	1271960	And then what does that allow? Well, it allows morphological computation of this developing disk of the fly that later turns into the wing.
1271960	1283960	And so there's advantages and disadvantages like with diffusible molecules, there's a tremendous amount of expressivity with what that molecule is like you have an infinite number of hormone possibilities.
1283960	1286960	But on the other hand, it's very slowly diffusing.
1286960	1289960	And maybe you can only signal a short range.
1289960	1292960	On the other hand, there's only like one electricity.
1292960	1298960	There's not like the blue membrane potential and the pink membrane potential as parallel membrane potential.
1298960	1300960	There's only one membrane potential.
1300960	1302960	So it's kind of a big knob to turn.
1302960	1308960	However, as shown here, it really does play a functional role in stabilizing gene regulatory networks.
1308960	1314960	If you were missing that part of the puzzle, it would be as incomplete as if you were missing a critical signaling molecule.
1314960	1326960	So I suspect that as advances, the kind that are going to be referenced in this paper, advances in being able to visualize and track and manipulate bioelectric fields become more accessible,
1326960	1335960	that more and more systems that were thought to be purely chemical or purely mechanical, I think that they'll be a more important role for bioelectricity.
1335960	1339960	Right. It is like one big surface, one membrane potential.
1339960	1350960	So you have one membrane and that's like the differentiator right between that's the boundary right is what is enclosed or encapsulated in the membrane versus what is not.
1350960	1352960	Okay, so here we are active inference.
1352960	1365960	This is the final keyword and I pulled this image out from the active inference lab, a previous live stream that we did with Ines and Thomas or Thomas.
1365960	1369960	So this is the free energy principle computation and computationalism and realism and tragedy.
1369960	1373960	And so this is just the basic action perception loop.
1373960	1378960	So you have active states, external states, sensory states and internal states.
1378960	1384960	And so the both of the active states and the sensory states are the blanket states, right.
1384960	1390960	So you have the the internal connect on the external via these two blanket states.
1390960	1399960	So this is all of the sensory perception of the organism and the degree on which they're able to act on the environment.
1399960	1403960	Do you want to add any thoughts here, Daniel?
1403960	1410960	Just that active inference is a unifying framework for thinking about perception, cognition and action.
1410960	1416960	And it does that in a scale free way that's grounded in Bayesian statistics and physics.
1416960	1422960	So it's going to be deployed as a way to help us look for different kinds of behavior across scales,
1422960	1428960	because the internal state could be internal to a cell, it could be internal to a tissue, internal to the organism, etc.
1428960	1435960	And it's that expressivity of the active inference framework that is going to come into play in the paper.
1435960	1441960	Awesome, and it's a process, a scale free process.
1441960	1446960	Okay, active inference as brought up in this paper.
1446960	1453960	The author says agents scaled up by evolving from basic homeostatic loops driven by active inference,
1453960	1460960	surprise minimization via addition of delays, which are memory, anticipation, which is inference and networks,
1460960	1467960	spatially distributed processing that enables learning and progressive abstraction or generalization from the data.
1467960	1474960	Gathering into larger collectives with optimal information structure also improves the computational i.e. predictive capabilities
1474960	1480960	and gives rise to functional relationships such as memories, encoded goal states, test, operate, test, exit loops
1480960	1483960	that exist over and above any individual member.
1483960	1491960	These levels coexist, enabling numerous coherent selves of different scales to be implemented by any collection of living matter.
1492960	1496960	That's intense.
1496960	1508960	One of the other pieces about active inference that differentiates it from a framework like reinforcement learning is right there that there's the minimization of surprise.
1508960	1517960	And in order to minimize surprise through time, you kind of have to be doing two things that at first pass don't seem like they're going to facilitate each other,
1517960	1521960	which is the pursuit of what you already know is going to be useful.
1521960	1527960	That's called pragmatic value, as well as the pursuit of sampling things that will be informative.
1527960	1529960	That's epistemic value.
1529960	1535960	And so in active inference, the way that agents through deep time minimize their surprise about perception,
1535960	1540960	that's what's referenced in the top paragraph about perceptual control theory,
1540960	1556960	the way that the agents minimize their surprise about their future expectations of perception is going to be by jointly working on pragmatic and epistemic aspects of their behavior
1556960	1566960	and thinking about what behavior is going to be minimizing free energy in terms of kind of existing on the optimal trade off where you're performing, but also learning.
1566960	1569960	So these are a few features of active inference that differentiate it.
1569960	1574960	And then if we think about like a growth cone of a neuron, is it doing reinforcement learning?
1574960	1576960	Is it doing reward maximization?
1576960	1578960	It just barely makes sense.
1578960	1585960	But once we start to think about surprise minimization, like it's a dad with an evolutionary prior, it expects to connect to a neuromuscular junction.
1585960	1589960	Then maybe some of its searching behavior makes more sense.
1590960	1597960	And in the top section also the author, you know, states that the sensory input layer is what enables active inference to operate.
1597960	1603960	So because there's receptors and channels that that's the perception, the perception for a cell.
1603960	1605960	Yeah, anyway, just thought I'd add that in.
1605960	1607960	Okay.
1607960	1609960	Greetings Sarah.
1609960	1611960	Hi Sarah.
1611960	1616960	Daniel, do you want to read these core assumptions and I'll fix the thing. Thank you.
1616960	1618960	Classic.
1618960	1626960	I'm only going to read the two highlighted parts here because these are paragraphs that people want more detail on.
1626960	1629960	They can definitely read the paper to learn more about.
1629960	1633960	There's three core assumptions that are laid out really clearly.
1633960	1641960	So I appreciated that about this paper that it makes clear assumptions and shows how those assumptions come into play.
1641960	1645960	And then basically there's two avenues for disagreeing.
1645960	1656960	I guess one would be, I think those are invalid assumptions, but they're properly applied, or one can think that they're valid assumptions but improperly applied.
1656960	1661960	And so that helps structure discussion with the contents of the paper.
1661960	1664960	So the first core assumption is a commitment to evolution.
1664960	1669960	Every capacity has a natural history and emerged from simpler variants.
1670960	1674960	I guess also evolution can proceed through a reduction of complexity.
1674960	1680960	So eventually it had to have emerged from simpler variants, but in the short time I guess it could have emerged from more complex variants.
1680960	1692960	But the commitment to evolution means the commitment to the dispelling of magical thinking and not looking for some sort of a metaphysical answer to our physical questions.
1692960	1702960	And the second assumption of the three is it is assumed that all metaphors are to be judged by their utility in driving scientific progress,
1702960	1709960	and there is not a binary categorization of scientific pictures which should be taken literally or not, which can be decided a priori.
1709960	1714960	So we're not going around with posted notes saying what's real or what's not.
1714960	1718960	We're using utility as a guiding metric.
1719960	1726960	We can actually just take a quick visualization and then Sarah, you can say hello and give any thoughts if you'd like.
1726960	1735960	But we previously in livestream 15 and 20 talked a lot about this continuum from realism to instrumentalism.
1735960	1739960	Like is active inference the territory itself? That's realism.
1739960	1743960	We're really describing what's really there when we make an active inference model.
1743960	1748960	Or instrumentalism on the right side here is like active inference as a map.
1748960	1757960	We're just using it as something that could be used to capture some features of a system and then used instrumentally like a model.
1757960	1767960	And then here we've introduced sort of this third vector of utility, which is like, okay, whether it's the map or the territory or diagonal to that is, is it useful?
1768960	1776960	And so this is a space that's describing not just where we can think about active inference existing, but also ways to evaluate different models.
1776960	1781960	Not that one is better than the other, but these are just different dimensions that models exist on.
1782960	1783960	Yeah.
1794960	1795960	All right.
1795960	1797960	Okay, maybe go to the third course option.
1797960	1798960	Onto the third one.
1798960	1804960	So much of the discussion centers around goals related to teleology, a hotly debated topic.
1804960	1820960	Here goal directedness is taken in the non magical cybernetic engineering and control theory sense of a feedback system that operates to maximize some specific state of affairs which could be modeled as a dynamical system with the tractors in its state space.
1821960	1827960	So to reiterate these three assumptions, the first one is evolution.
1827960	1829960	The second one is utility.
1829960	1834960	And the third one is a non magical sense of goal directedness.
1834960	1838960	So these three assumptions play nice with each other.
1838960	1844960	And then they also lead directly to this final statement that except for a few brief remarks at the end.
1845960	1853960	No claims about consciousness defined rapidly as first person experience or sense of self as qualia are made.
1853960	1860960	All the examples concern functional third person objective capacities, computation and behaviors.
1860960	1865960	So we're kind of like outside of systems looking at them as an investigator.
1865960	1867960	This isn't about the first person perspective.
1867960	1872960	And there's always so much fascination and interest in what consciousness is.
1872960	1884960	But in a way, these three assumptions go a really long distance towards just saying, hey, let's look at the systems behavior as we observe it, rather than as we imagine it to be like.
1884960	1890960	So that's at least a starting point for a great discussion.
1890960	1897960	Before we jump into the figures, Sarah, do you want to give any thoughts or say hello?
1897960	1901960	Sure. Yeah, I am.
1901960	1912960	I'm kind of coming in pretty different, but I've tried to follow Michael's work quite a bit and I'm enjoying discussing it from whatever angle comes up.
1912960	1915960	And, oh, I don't know background who cares.
1915960	1918960	I'm in philosophy right now.
1918960	1921960	Yeah, that's all.
1921960	1922960	Nice.
1922960	1928960	Well, any slide you want to chime in on is great.
1928960	1930960	I have to find the slides.
1930960	1933960	Yeah, anyway.
1933960	1939960	Okay.
1939960	1941960	Go for figure one blue if you want.
1941960	1942960	Sure.
1942960	1945960	So this is a continuum of cognitive powers.
1945960	1948960	So this is just the first part of the figure.
1948960	1950960	We'll show the next part in the next slide.
1950960	1977960	So the author says that by continuously taking action to minimize the distance, the difference in error between the current state of affairs and a set point describing a different possible future state of affairs, it enables a system to pursue goals despite perturbations from the outside world and intrinsic noise.
1978960	1990960	So this is, I thought, cool, like, you know, the first, like, possible counterfactual, like, yes, it's 75 degrees and I have plenty of sodium and potassium and, you know, calcium.
1990960	1993960	But what if I don't always, what if it's not always this way, right?
1993960	1995960	What if what if my state changes?
1995960	2000960	So like that the first counterfactual maybe enabled this kind of homeostatic feedback loop.
2000960	2003960	I thought that that was a neat idea put forward in the paper.
2003960	2008960	So how is this related to active inference or systems engineering, Daniel?
2008960	2016960	Well, the terminology reminded me a lot more of engineering than we often see, like sensors and actuators.
2016960	2019960	It makes it sound like it's going to be a robot.
2019960	2024960	And also this like test exit sounds like we're going to be doing sort of software evaluation.
2024960	2035960	But we can pretty clearly see the skeleton of action perception loops, whether it's framed as it was a couple slides ago with internal external states and then blanket states.
2035960	2045960	Or here, where you had basically have the difference between the desired and expected value, leading to policy selection, not shown here, leading to action.
2045960	2050960	Actions cause events in the environment on the yonder side of the blanket.
2050960	2060960	And then the state of the external environment influences the measurements on the inbound side, which are again contrasted with the idealized state.
2060960	2062960	And that leads to another round of action selection.
2062960	2070960	So this is an engineering way of laying out the tote test operate test exit loop.
2070960	2077960	But who knows, we're able to jump from active inference pretty nicely into a more engineering frame.
2077960	2084960	And so perhaps engineering could be integrated closely into active inference.
2084960	2092960	Yeah, it seems like the blanket states like the sensors and actuators like our, you know, the action perception part are here in the middle.
2092960	2097960	And so it kind of reminds me of the active inference loop like diagram that we showed earlier.
2097960	2101960	So it's interesting.
2101960	2105960	Next part. Do you want to go through this one Daniel?
2105960	2116960	Yeah, so in figure one B, the caption reads that the scale is showing how different types of activity and systems can be ranked according to their degree of purposeness.
2116960	2121960	So again, think about purpose in the third person, not the first person.
2121960	2128960	Not the sense of purpose, but more what I believe Hofstetter called the anti-spectus niche.
2128960	2135960	I'm not sort of pronounced it, but it was like, think about the most mindless behavior and then push away from that.
2135960	2142960	And that's what you can call purposeful rather than imagining that there's like this pure crystallized purposeful behavior.
2142960	2148960	And it sort of goes from bottom to top in terms of the degree of purpose ability.
2148960	2161960	And on the bottom, we see basically just action that doesn't appear to have any kind of sense or purpose to it, like maybe gas molecules bumping around.
2161960	2166960	And then we progress through higher higher levels of feedback loops.
2166960	2170960	And then each one of these brackets, it's kind of like a distinction.
2170960	2177960	So like starting the left behavior, you can take the right branch or bottom branch passive behavior like a ball that's being thrown or active behavior.
2178960	2183960	Okay, active behavior. Is it going to be non random or random?
2183960	2191960	Like many things are random, but you know, is it a wind up toy that's just doing something that is not appearing to be too purposeful?
2191960	2205960	And you continue up and up the branch choosing the higher branch each time till you get to these first and second order predictions and higher order recursive logics, which are seen as higher and higher levels of purpose.
2207960	2211960	Cool. Do you have any thoughts, Sarah?
2211960	2215960	Okay.
2215960	2219960	Daniel, do you want to take this one?
2219960	2227960	What is an individual? Well, there's so many ways to go about this. And as an aunt researcher, that's always the debate.
2227960	2240960	Like, okay, is the individual the six legged next mate, and then that makes the colony like a society or a super individual, or is the colony the individual and then the nest mate is like the tissue.
2240960	2249960	So there's a lot of discussion around what constitutes an individual and how would you determine where the boundaries of individual individuality are.
2250960	2257960	And that piece I just referenced about establishing the bounds can be done in a few different ways.
2257960	2264960	One of them would be looking at where information theory is strongest or where information flows are occurring.
2264960	2267960	That's the information theory of individuality.
2267960	2272960	And here we're going to take a cognitive perspective on individuation.
2272960	2277960	And McCulloch is quoted so early in the neural network days.
2277960	2293960	The definition of the paper is I propose a definition of an individual based upon its information processing structure, the scales and types of goals that a system can pursue to finds slash determines the boundaries and contents of the putative agent.
2293960	2299960	So it's an informational lens on what constitutes an individual.
2299960	2313960	Like, we can say that individual people become maybe an individual mob, just one mob, not multiple mobs, when they start integrating information differently, or when they start pursuing different kinds of goals in a different way.
2313960	2325960	And it touches on these big questions like, why does it matter how we define individual, as well as what other ways of thinking about individuality exists.
2325960	2327960	Yeah, it's intense, right?
2327960	2336960	So not only like in the information theory of individuality, is it like the most concentrated information, but it's also like that bi-directional information flow, right?
2336960	2341960	Is how Krakauer and that group defined individuality in that paper.
2341960	2343960	And so that's super interesting to me.
2343960	2347960	Like at what point is there downward causation in an aggregate?
2348960	2356960	So it's at that point, that is like the crux for how they talked about individuality, which is, I mean, it makes sense to me, right?
2356960	2363960	Like, you know, my brain tells my foot to kick the ball, or I decide I want to kick the ball, and so my body then acts accordingly.
2363960	2371960	But it's really interesting to think about when that emerges, that downward causation in a system.
2371960	2376960	Anyway, something I think a lot about probably too much.
2376960	2378960	What about you, Tara?
2380960	2386960	Yeah, that is actually one of the few papers I actually have read, and I like went with a highlighter and everything.
2386960	2395960	And I always wonder on, I was looking through the math on that, and I actually learned a lot about, like, math I didn't even think was possible yet.
2395960	2399960	But it was binary in a sense, it was digital.
2399960	2405960	And I'm never clear about when that matters and when it doesn't in these kinds of models.
2405960	2408960	So that's one thing that came up for me.
2411960	2413960	Sounds good.
2413960	2415960	Next slide.
2415960	2421960	No, it's not the Sims, it's a cone of individuation.
2421960	2433960	And in 2A is this sort of like cone based representation of individuality that's going to be returning in a few different guises in the paper.
2433960	2448960	And on the plane going out in different directions from a central point is like the zone of influence or the extent of the systems ability to perceive act plan.
2448960	2455960	And then piercing that coming up and down in the C dimension is going from the past to the future.
2456960	2468960	And so this is a cool way to look at how multi-scale systems or what are called compound intelligences, compound intelligences down there on the bottom right exist.
2468960	2477960	So we can use this kind of a cone representation or to look at single cognitive agents and potentially contrast them.
2477960	2489960	Like in part B, where we have a tick with what's hypothesized to be like a smaller scope, spatially in the now, as well as a shorter temporal scope in the past and future.
2489960	2498960	Compare a tick with a human and then also ask maybe about what kinds of other cognitive forms exist.
2498960	2502960	And then these cones can be composed really nicely.
2503960	2511960	On the example on the bottom right with an ant colony, again, controversial to say that the ant is the organism when potentially the colony is the organism.
2511960	2513960	That's why I usually call them an estimate.
2513960	2520960	But we can see how the estimates are inside of the colony within this cone.
2520960	2526960	And so the colony pushes out the boundaries of what these ants can do.
2526960	2530960	So they're kind of like on different parts of the spatial plane in the current moments.
2530960	2543960	And then the colony is something that is cognitively able to move beyond the time horizon of an individual nest mate by virtue of its collective organization and information processing.
2543960	2555960	This is cool and something that we talked about a lot like offline in preparation for this and preparing the slides is like the inversion of the typical like light cone.
2556960	2563960	So maybe Daniel, you want to walk us through this light cone and then we can maybe go back to the other one.
2563960	2568960	Yeah, so this is a similar light cone notion.
2568960	2577960	And it's just that instead of having the two cups, you know, meeting mouth to mouth and then coming pinch off in a small time.
2577960	2584960	Another way that light cones have been represented is actually with the current moments like the eye of the needle.
2584960	2586960	Our glass, the pinch point.
2586960	2597960	And then in the past and in the future are the set of states that influence a given point and then the set of states it influences.
2597960	2602960	So let's like think about that butterfly flopping its wings in the here and now.
2602960	2609960	So if you go back one time step, the air molecules that might influence it are like one layer of air molecule away.
2609960	2616960	And as you go back and back and back, more and more spatial extents matters for the state of the butterfly in the moment.
2616960	2625960	And then similarly one time step in the future, the butterflies flapping is only able to influence a small zone proximal to the insect.
2625960	2634960	Whereas further and further out into the future, more and more spatial extents might be modified because of the actions that happen in the here and now.
2635960	2640960	And then this is a Lee Kors cabinet, you know, joke on a liquor cabinet.
2640960	2654960	But it's a paper that actually uses this kind of an approach to do modeling of empirical data and to fit machine learning models, which we can talk about going forward.
2655960	2666960	Why and how do you get a speed up of certain kinds of simulations or data fitting by approaching it like a light come.
2666960	2679960	So it's just interesting the axes here like and this is kind of how I'm used to seeing these represented our time and space right so like in physical space I am physically in this space that I am at right now.
2679960	2688960	And it's interesting as like, you know, as you go forward in time, like, you know, given enough like hours, I could theoretically like fly from New Mexico to Singapore.
2688960	2695960	But like for right now, I mean, I'm kind of limited to like my house or my block or, you know, like I don't have like point to point transport.
2696960	2714960	So I always like the way that Mike represents this light cone, like in this way, like in the inverse, it's like time and space and, and you know, it gets, it starts in a very broad space, and it proceeds to a very narrow space.
2714960	2724960	And it's like, of course, in the past, like if I go to my distant past, like I came out of an egg that was in my mother's uterus, right, like so in my mother's womb, like I came, that's where I came from.
2724960	2732960	I was in that one point, and I've gone all kinds of places, I guess until now, but I'm not, I don't feel like I'm many places now.
2732960	2743960	And I also don't feel like I'm going to be many places in the future, so I'm interested to talk to Mike when he comes on to the live stream about the way that this is represented, because it's very different.
2743960	2747960	Do you guys have any more thoughts on that?
2747960	2749960	Yeah, I have one.
2749960	2761960	I mean, it seems to me he's, he's almost trying to do, he's almost trying to take the case of the light cone and look at a particular ambition that you might have at this point in time.
2761960	2770960	And then, and then can you carry out that ambition through time and as you get further and further, you realize there's all these impediments, you know, that come in your way.
2770960	2777960	And so it's just like one axis is the ability to envision what it is you want to do.
2777960	2789960	And the other axis is the ability to enact it, is the ability to, well, even control or whatever your environment, any number of things that are required to enact this vision that you have.
2789960	2796960	And that's an interesting, interesting axis transformation.
2796960	2808960	Agreed, the light cone where the, that looks more like an hourglass is kind of related to our limited degrees of freedom in the current moment.
2808960	2812960	But it, you know, expanding out into the future of what we can influence.
2812960	2823960	And then the diamond shape that we see in figure two is more like our zone of what can be cognized, which goes beyond what we can influence in the current moment.
2823960	2834960	Because there's some future time when you won't be able to imagine, you know, as the curtains close on life and it narrows in and it's like smaller and smaller.
2834960	2840960	And then there's some point where your capacity to influence is actually kind of toned out.
2840960	2845960	And so there are two complementary ways to look at the same thing.
2845960	2860960	Although it's interesting, I want to say, because I, you know, like you look at, like there could be some inner supervening or intervening thing where it actually helps you that you never considered in this cone of possibility.
2860960	2866960	So you've become wider, like really it's just this mind road, right?
2866960	2870960	For sure.
2870960	2871960	All right, moving on.
2871960	2873960	Let's go to 28.
2873960	2881960	This is sort of taking the light cone is just one and a half more slides that take the light cone and a little bit of a different, more physical direction.
2881960	2885960	But again, it's all part of a continued conversation.
2885960	2887960	So we can look at the now.
2887960	2901960	That's the middle of those three layers where there's two different like individuals, you know, Sally and, you know, friend and so it's like two of those are at different points now.
2901960	2903960	And so then we look over on the time cone on the right.
2903960	2907960	And so agent N is, you know, Nick, that's the one that we're focusing on.
2907960	2913960	And now the same time they're at the same moment, but they're in different points in space.
2913960	2920960	And so from the point of view of N, S is a space like point.
2920960	2935960	But then in the same spot in the future or the past F or P in the same location, you know, the same address 20 minutes ago is time like and the same address 20 minutes in the future is also time like.
2935960	2948960	But then on the edges of this cone is like light, which I don't know the physics behind, but I think it's kind of a cool idea that space and time have this boundary nature.
2948960	2960960	And that there's things that are more space like, like things that are instantaneously at the same moment, but in different spaces, and more time like the pure case being the same location at a different time.
2960960	2964960	But then it's like, I'll meet you in 20 minutes to blocks away.
2964960	2971960	That's like moving through both space and time, and maybe light does that in a kind of unique way.
2971960	2982960	So there's just one way that in relativity that they talk about light cones and indeed the light cone concept is a is a physicist's concept.
2982960	2990960	That's really cool to think about like the light is the boundary between space and time.
2990960	2992960	That's kind of a neat thought.
2993960	3003960	And then on 29, I just wanted to pull one again, the details going beyond me and this discussion.
3003960	3011960	But here in a recent paper that explored how you could do simulations using light cones.
3011960	3015960	And so this is not just like sort of a metaphor or cognitive heuristic.
3015960	3019960	This is something that you can use for large scale data analysis.
3019960	3030960	And so the way which I alluded to earlier in which you can speak up a simulation potentially by using the light cone is by having a point that you're focusing on.
3030960	3041960	And then you only need to consider one time point in the past at a radius of one spatially two time points in the past radius of two spatially three three out.
3041960	3054960	And so it helps you reduce the space of what you need to calculate from all versus all to the idea of calculating more and more out in more and more past steps and more and more out as you go into the future.
3054960	3062960	So that's because in the physical interpretation, there's a speed of propagation through a media.
3062960	3064960	So things don't happen instantaneously.
3064960	3068960	So that's like light moving through a media at speed of light.
3068960	3072960	And then in the case of information propagation, it's similar.
3072960	3083960	Like if you wanted to focus on a given person and their role on an informational network, you would maybe make like an informational cone instead of needing to calculate all by all at every single time steps.
3083960	3089960	So just made us curious about how active inference related to light cones.
3089960	3093960	So how can we apply this to some of the simulation models that we've already seen?
3093960	3098960	And then just, you know, what does the past of the light cone represent?
3098960	3099960	What is the current moment?
3099960	3100960	What's the future?
3100960	3103960	Just fun, eternal questions.
3105960	3106960	Cool.
3107960	3109960	Ah, so I made this slide.
3109960	3110960	This is funny.
3110960	3116960	This light cone I actually showed when I gave a seminar at Mike Levin's lab a couple of years ago.
3116960	3124960	It's from Andrew Gallimore's paper, Restructuring Consciousness, The Psychedelic State in the Light of Integrated Information Theory.
3124960	3132960	But I was thinking about this in terms of shrinking and expanding the boundary of the self, which the author discusses a lot in the paper here.
3133960	3137960	And just like how that would change your effective light cone, right?
3137960	3145960	Like, so if you have your, your self boundary, it's like a limited light cone, like the darker one that's shown in this figure on the right.
3145960	3148960	And if you expand the boundary of yourself, it expands your light cone.
3148960	3155960	So it made me think of that as we were talking, as he was talking, as Mike was talking about the shrinking and expanding the boundary of the self in the paper.
3155960	3156960	And so I'm really curious.
3156960	3161960	Here's a couple of quotes from the paper about boundary establishment and maintenance.
3161960	3168960	So he says, the surrounding body becomes an informational shield or Markov blanket for the stem cell.
3168960	3172960	And this is, he references Carl Friston's 2013 paper.
3172960	3177960	And so I wonder about like the Markov blanket.
3177960	3184960	And I think that, you know, Daniel, this is something you and I have talked about as well about the Markov blanket, like being the defining boundary for the self.
3186960	3191960	And like how, I mean, things must pop in and out of a Markov blanket.
3191960	3192960	Right?
3192960	3196960	Like if I think about the cells that are in my skin layer, right?
3196960	3200960	Like, I mean, I'm losing them all the time and new ones are constantly being added.
3200960	3204960	So there's no distinct hard line to be drawn.
3204960	3208960	So like under, like how do things pop in and out of a Markov blanket?
3208960	3214960	Like, and what do you, can you like just have like peripheral boundary nodes on the edges there?
3214960	3218960	Like I've talked before also about like the difference between like your fingernail and your cuticle.
3218960	3223960	Like there's like a small tiny layer that doesn't know whether it's a fingernail or a cuticle.
3223960	3227960	So it's like, how do you like have these like boundaries, right?
3227960	3229960	Anyway, another quote from the paper.
3229960	3241960	Crucially, by organizing into a partial electrochemical and informational pool or synctetium, somebody say that for me please.
3242960	3244960	Syn, syncytium.
3244960	3245960	Syncytium.
3245960	3246960	There we go.
3246960	3255960	All of the cells are able to measure and detect events occurring within the same boundary, creating a larger individual that emerges from the collective.
3255960	3270960	And I think this quote was like in reference to the gap junctions and how they expand that electrochemical pool by like they open up like some, like they pull the plug on the electrochemical gradient and so it kind of enables this like cell linkage.
3271960	3279960	So that's one, one way that, you know, boundaries are maybe established, but any thoughts on this guys?
3283960	3284960	We'll come back to it.
3284960	3288960	I think I have a few thoughts on where the mark off like it's coming to play through time.
3288960	3289960	Cool.
3289960	3290960	All right.
3290960	3293960	So homeostasis, which we promised to come back to.
3293960	3298960	So what evolutionary pressures led cognitive boundaries to the to expand.
3298960	3305960	This is from the paper and the author proposes that the atom of this cognitive hierarchy is homeostasis.
3305960	3315960	So reactive homeostasis evolves into predictive allostasis under the pressure to predict signals from the environment and other elements of the biosphere.
3315960	3325960	And that's like what I was talking about earlier about the first like counterfactual about, you know, what if it's not always 76 degrees and full of nutrients in my environment?
3325960	3327960	How can I regulate that?
3327960	3331960	Reduce my uncertainty about future availability of the supplies that I need.
3333960	3337960	And also there's this nice progression from homeostasis.
3337960	3342960	So that's sort of like similar, you know, same homeostasis.
3342960	3345960	It's the thermometer is trying to get within the bound.
3345960	3356960	But the best way to stay within the bounds when the environment is changing is actually to not just be reactive, but to be proactive or predictive.
3356960	3359960	And then what's the best way to be proactive?
3359960	3364960	Well, it's to have increasingly rich generative models of the niche.
3364960	3371960	If you know that nighttime is coming, you're going to be able to take really good predictive behavior right now for tonight.
3371960	3379960	If you know that winter is coming at a larger time scale, it's another level of you being able to make adaptive decisions.
3379960	3388960	So what looks like homeostasis sometimes can actually just be very skillful predictive allostasis.
3393960	3395960	Do you have any thoughts Sarah on that?
3398960	3399960	Cool.
3402960	3407960	Okay, so this one is memory and scale free cognition and active inference.
3408960	3415960	So, I don't know, I just had some thoughts here like memory in as a gene regulatory network.
3415960	3434960	And this is kind of something that not really was stated in this paper, but really like, you know, it's our evolutionary memory of like where we've been before and how we've come to regulate and, you know, work within our environmental condition and like also memory as a process like, I don't know.
3435960	3440960	I think about that, like where is it stored? Is it externalized into the niche?
3440960	3444960	Like we do a lot of niche modification and so, I don't know.
3444960	3451960	It's interesting to think about our RAM and our ROM in like a biological sense.
3451960	3460960	So it's the author says a second step in the simplest homeostatic loop is the inclusion of a richer set of hidden layers in the neural network sense.
3460960	3466960	These are additional biochemical nodes between sensors and effectors of a given system that enable a degree of memory.
3466960	3475960	And importantly, memory can serve as the beginning of modularity because learning essentially groups diverse stimuli into compressed representations.
3475960	3480960	Complex states of affairs become remembered as compact biophysical and grams.
3480960	3490960	This is the essence of the kind of modularity when a simple biophysical event kicks off the formation of a complex morphogenetic cascade such as building a hand in embryogenesis.
3492960	3500960	One nice point there is the difference between modularity and memory about how they enable each other.
3500960	3506960	It's sort of like if everything is being mixed in one cup, there can't be a memory of different colors.
3506960	3511960	Well, if you have two separated cups, you can remember two different colors and so on.
3511960	3522960	So memory can serve as the beginning of modularity is saying that it's this relationship between things becoming distinct and being remembered through time.
3522960	3525960	Distinctness carried through time is memory.
3525960	3533960	You can remember a longer number when you have more modularity that's being propagated through time.
3533960	3549960	And then the paper on the right is an older first in paper talking about memory, attention and salience and active inference where they described memory, working memory as a process of evidence accumulation in a temporarily structured hierarchy.
3549960	3557960	So I guess like going back through deep time, like that's where the gene regulatory network kind of comes in as a process, right?
3557960	3562960	Like the process of evolution and that's like the working memory there anyway.
3562960	3567960	And just one note there on the multi-scale active inference models.
3567960	3576960	Sometimes the way that memory is being modeled in active inference is as a state variable that changes at a slower rate.
3576960	3587960	And so within the longer timescale model, we have a shorter timescale model and then that can be modeled from setting to setting as memory carrying over.
3588960	3598960	And so it relates to this idea that the larger cognitive system is able to also act over longer timescales as well as reach back with the deeper memory.
3598960	3607960	Because if you have the kind of short-term model that's just standalone, it's like a memory-less process.
3607960	3615960	But if that has inherited from a hierarchical model, the state from a previous click of the model, it's memory.
3615960	3620960	And then if it's able to imagine one more click out into the future, it's goal planning, it's anticipation.
3620960	3631960	And so in active inference, one of the ways that we integrate memory and planning together is by thinking about hierarchically nested models.
3631960	3636960	So also I wonder what role memory plays in policy selection.
3636960	3643960	Like I remember every summer when I go to Scotland, it is cold, right?
3643960	3646960	Like I mean, I live in New Mexico, it's like 120 degrees here, Fahrenheit.
3646960	3650960	So every summer I remember that when I go to Scotland, it's cold.
3650960	3654960	So now it's my policy to bring a jacket when I go, right?
3654960	3657960	So even though it's the summertime and I wouldn't normally do that.
3657960	3662960	So is that memory also ever modeled in the policy selection, Daniel?
3665960	3667960	It's a good question.
3667960	3673960	Like I wonder if you can plan to forget or, you know, I'll make a note, I'll plan to remember.
3673960	3680960	I'd say active inference just gives us a way to think about all those different affordances that real cognitive systems have,
3680960	3688960	like offloading memory to the niche through external computation or in terms of what you just described.
3688960	3691960	But that's a good question we can ask.
3691960	3696960	Right. I don't actually even need to remember that it's cold in Scotland because, you know, I can just ask Google.
3696960	3699960	They will tell me the weather and it will be cold in Scotland.
3699960	3704960	So if I just remember to, you know, check my cognitive offloading device,
3704960	3707960	then I don't even need to remember to bring a jacket when I go.
3707960	3709960	Yep.
3709960	3711960	Okay, next.
3711960	3713960	So figure three.
3713960	3715960	I have one random thought.
3715960	3722960	Maybe it comes up in another slide, but is this question that Michael Levin has about how does it know when to stop in terms of cell growth
3722960	3727960	or for Genesis, if it's the case that it's connected to memory in the way that he's suggesting then,
3727960	3731960	you know, like maybe it's to make the information flow.
3731960	3734960	I guess that's maybe obvious given the focus of this.
3734960	3740960	But it is interesting, you know, it's like the cell is just like, oh, we've got it.
3740960	3751960	We've got to now become multi-bodied or, you know, or become social rather than individual in order to store memory like there's a funny like break point.
3752960	3758960	Yeah, I didn't see the stop mechanism really brought up in this paper, but I have seen it.
3758960	3762960	So I'm not really sure where it ties in here.
3768960	3769960	Figure three.
3769960	3778960	I mean, I mean, if you talk about a morphogenic cascade, you know, it's like, well, we're, we were born, we grow, we grow to a certain point and then we shrivel and die.
3778960	3781960	So it's like, how does that connect to memory and information?
3781960	3783960	Wow, it's kind of suggested.
3785960	3786960	Yep.
3787960	3795960	So figure three is looking at sort of cells I view of that time cone.
3795960	3799960	And now we're going to step away from, you know, is it a time diamond or is the time cone?
3799960	3803960	And we're going to just think about the trajectory of a given cell.
3803960	3805960	Go back to the assumptions of the paper, though.
3805960	3808960	This isn't about whether the cell is experiencing things.
3808960	3810960	It's not what it's like to be a cell.
3810960	3819960	It's about how the cell has a given spatial extent in a it has given spatial extent that can be thought of as having a memory.
3819960	3826960	It inherits a history through time and then also has an anticipation zone in the future.
3826960	3834960	Then it can do anticipation of memory as a soul agent, or it can interact socially.
3834960	3839960	So what happens when it interacts socially with other agents like itself?
3839960	3844960	Well, it expands the spatial dimension in the now.
3844960	3847960	That's what's being called integrated spatial perception.
3847960	3851960	And that allows it to have expanded memory in the past.
3851960	3858960	Like if each of your five friends have a book, then there's more memory as a group because there's more books.
3858960	3863960	And then also the ability to extend the anticipation into the future.
3863960	3869960	And then this part I just highlighted in blue is joining into communication networks
3869960	3875960	allows the cell to have temporarily delayed access to the information obtained by neighboring cells.
3875960	3878960	This is where the time cone comes into play.
3878960	3883960	It's not that when something is perceived by one of these cells off on the fringe,
3883960	3887960	the focal cell doesn't instantly hear about it.
3887960	3890960	They hear about it one time step later.
3890960	3894960	So that's where the time the time cone comes into play.
3894960	3902960	Because from the point of view of this focal cell, just assuming that information moves one cell per unit of time,
3902960	3907960	then at zero time points, its radius is one.
3907960	3913960	One time point away, its ability to integrate sense is one more radius away.
3913960	3919960	And so you can keep on clicking back and that's reflecting a broader and broader zone of memory.
3919960	3926960	Or you can carry it forward with a broader and broader zone of influences or states that it can affect.
3926960	3933960	And so the resulting larger individual, and again individual is being used cognitively here,
3933960	3941960	not like evolutionarily, is formed with a cognitive world that's unified by the cells sharing of information across time and space.
3941960	3950960	So no teleportation and no time travel, the limitations of propagation of information in our physical universe
3950960	3958960	means that from the point of any given cell or agents, it's existing in this time cone like structure.
3958960	3966960	Yeah, that was like the expanding the boundary of the cell and like kind of like what happens like the time cone is expanded.
3966960	3977960	And you know what this just makes me think of well first, I just want to remind everyone that this like cell cell communication is like what is what gap junctions facilitate because they're really connecting all cells and solid tissues.
3977960	3982960	But but really I thought about you know the old adage that you are your company.
3982960	3994960	And like if you think about you know your five like closest friends and that like communication like network that you have like you hear about you know world events or events that are relevant to their lives.
3994960	4004960	It might be relevant to you like you hear about it one time step later and just how like, you know your cognitive like boundary is expanded by like your inner circle.
4004960	4007960	I don't know, maybe think of that.
4007960	4008960	Yep.
4008960	4014960	Can you just, can you just re highlight or talk about the cell dimension that you're just mentioning.
4014960	4020960	Oh yeah, so that was earlier in the talk it was one of the keywords so let me just go back to that slide.
4020960	4024960	So here, these gap junctions.
4024960	4033960	So they are, they were originally, you know, categorized in like neural tissue and in muscle, you know, to facilitate like rapid communication.
4033960	4046960	But they're really present in every cell and solid tissue and they just perform not ion exchange but it's like passive diffusion of ions, so that it's like almost a shared intercellular space.
4047960	4055960	So what did you say to call that a kind of a information bottleneck?
4055960	4056960	I just wonder.
4056960	4064960	So maybe not as much of a bottleneck as it is like it pokes a hole in informational boundary.
4064960	4068960	Yeah, so that is the more rapidly.
4068960	4070960	Let's just say that the gap junction.
4070960	4080960	So the no gap junction, it moves like takes three time steps for the signal, you know, one time step to release the molecule one for it to diffuse one for it to be perceived.
4080960	4085960	So every three units of time, you're getting a radius expanding out by one.
4085960	4090960	Now let's just say that a gap junction allows one time step the direct diffusion.
4090960	4100960	So then the time cone is expanding wider because the diffusion from the target cell is able to sweep out a larger time cone.
4100960	4106960	Whereas if again if it took three units of time for every one of diffusion, it'd be like a narrower time cone.
4106960	4119960	So rat communication, which is never instant allows that time cone to access more memory into the presence and then influence more broadly.
4119960	4125960	And so bottleneck is sort of like thinking like a bottleneck is a constraint relative to the width of the bottle.
4125960	4132960	But in the context of a gap junction, it's actually like a channel or an opening for information transmission.
4132960	4147960	So if you think about it in terms of like your inner circle of friends, imagine like you can wait for your friend to call you up and tell you this exciting new event or like you can have a wire tap into their house.
4147960	4150960	So like the gap junction is like having a wire tap into their house.
4150960	4155960	So like you always know like what is going on.
4155960	4156960	Okay.
4156960	4160960	What I'm also searching for another analogy that's just stay into this stuff I've been looking at lately.
4160960	4166960	Do you think it's fair that analysis is to, you know, compression function?
4166960	4172960	Like, you know, if you picture the classic neural net, you know, a bunch of notes here, just a few in the center of the hidden layer and then expand it out.
4172960	4179960	Would it better be a fair analogy or a gap junction?
4179960	4181960	Yeah, I'm not seeing it.
4181960	4182960	Sorry.
4182960	4183960	Okay.
4183960	4185960	Okay, I would just to recover it.
4185960	4194960	I would just say the transmission is like a compressed form of it's like a little sampling of the chemical milieu from one cell being passed to the other.
4194960	4200960	If there was no bottleneck, no compression of information, they would be just in one unit.
4200960	4202960	They'd be in one Markov blanket.
4202960	4211960	And so there's this trade off where if you totally isolate the rate of information propagation is low, the modularity is very high though.
4211960	4217960	On the other hand, with total integration, you can't have memory because you don't have modularity.
4217960	4221960	However, you do have instantaneous or close to that transmission.
4221960	4237960	And then the gap junction exists at this kind of sweet spot that allows for modularity with narrow channels of communication, which is what Shannon was studying in the first place.
4237960	4238960	Cool.
4238960	4239960	So figure.
4239960	4240960	Okay.
4240960	4242960	So figure three, I think we just put popped on the cone.
4242960	4243960	Is that true?
4244960	4245960	Yep.
4245960	4252960	That's just to draw the connection between the figure two with the time diamonds time cone and then just this figure.
4252960	4254960	Cool.
4254960	4255960	Okay.
4255960	4257960	Figure four.
4257960	4260960	So figure three.
4260960	4266960	Yeah, well, the figure three, the slide that we just had was like, as things build out.
4266960	4268960	So that was the point of view of the agent building out.
4268960	4270960	And now it's like things fall apart.
4270960	4280960	So figure four, we see a sort of rehearsal in B of what we saw previously, which is that that target cell, it's combining sensory information.
4280960	4285960	That's able enabling it to detect patterns more rapidly getting a big picture.
4285960	4287960	That's what it says in B.
4287960	4293960	And therefore missing information can be anticipated by this pattern seeking drive.
4293960	4296960	But what happens when things go wrong?
4296960	4302960	That's in C where this bottom right cell, the green one has gone rogue.
4302960	4309960	It has stopped communicating in a way that was participating in this broader sense making.
4309960	4313960	And it has shrunk its sensory radius down.
4313960	4319960	And so in doing so, it reduced the cognitive capacity of the other four cells.
4319960	4322960	And it has reduced its own sphere of influence.
4322960	4332960	And it's also introduced this adversarial dynamic potentially over evolutionary or developmental timescales.
4332960	4333960	Cool.
4333960	4336960	Any more thoughts on that one?
4336960	4341960	Yeah, it reminds me of a friend I know, but no, otherwise.
4342960	4348960	Cancer research is starting to think more about the niche and the signaling between cancer and non-cancer cells.
4348960	4351960	Like cancer cells need to call down healthy blood vessels.
4351960	4356960	They need to prevent healthy immune response from taking them out.
4356960	4363960	And so it's like cancer as a dialectic or as a relationship between agents with different goals.
4363960	4367960	Again, not the experience of the goal, but acting as if it has a goal.
4367960	4371960	That third person cybernetic teleology.
4371960	4383960	And so that helps us make sense of all these disparate features of cancer by thinking about internal and external states, information propagation, etc.
4383960	4390960	What if you think it would be right or off to think about the one possible place where that could go wrong?
4390960	4392960	Happening at the gap junction.
4392960	4402960	Like the gap junction would no longer function as a good sampler compression thing, which I know you don't agree with the analogy, but something like that.
4402960	4408960	I don't know what's happening in that research area, but does that make any sense?
4408960	4415960	Yeah, we talked about gap junctions earlier and their involvement in neoplasticity and all kinds of other disorders.
4415960	4417960	So definitely.
4417960	4425960	I just found this really nice paper called gap junctions and cancer communicating for 50 years.
4425960	4439960	The abstract starts with 50 years ago tumor cells were found to lack electrical coupling, leading to the hypothesis that loss of direct intracellular communication is commonly associated with cancer progression and onset.
4439960	4441960	So that's pretty interesting.
4441960	4449960	It's like when you shut down the lines of communication, like between two countries, are those two countries having an improving relationship?
4449960	4453960	Or is that like the last time that they spoke before war?
4453960	4463960	So closing down the embassy, shutting down the gap junction, it doesn't bode well for sort of amicable resolution to conflict or communication.
4463960	4471960	That's why it's so important to maintain the avenues of communication, even when there is an adversarial relationship, because things can always get worse.
4471960	4481960	You can always shut down the communication, which will make the generative models and the incentives and the goals diverged even more.
4481960	4483960	Cool.
4483960	4487960	I don't know. I'll just send you into politics and I'm like, yeah, but wait a minute.
4487960	4489960	Anyway.
4489960	4495960	No, but we should shut down. They're bad. We should shut down.
4495960	4501960	If you keep the channel open, you also stand more chance of injury by way of keeping the channel open.
4501960	4505960	Keep the channel open until you shouldn't.
4505960	4517960	This is just a fun discussion for a little bit on the evolutionary anachronism, which means just something that's happening at a different time than it's expected, like a feature from the past that gets brought back.
4517960	4521960	Like an evolutionary reversion.
4521960	4537960	And so in the paper, it's described that this is a breakdown of multicellularity and highlights the fact that the scale of the structure which sells work to maintain can change rapidly for cooperation towards an entire organ system or body.
4537960	4541960	That's a healthy organism to the level of a single cell.
4541960	4555960	Instead of seeing cancer just mechanistically as a derangement of signaling or derangement of replication and DNA reproduction of a cell, we can think about it informationally and cognitively and cybernetically.
4555960	4563960	Like the cell has changed its cybernetic horizon from the goals of the organism to its own local goals.
4564960	4576960	And so this concept of an evolutionary anachronism and how even in the current day, we can study anachronism in examples with avocados, a tasty fruit.
4576960	4588960	And as per the Wikipedia, it says avocados are exceptionally fatty fruits with seeds far too large to be successfully dispersed by any wild animal presently alive in the Americas.
4588960	4601960	And so that is a paper of Janssen and Martin in the 80s, which was actually talking about the ecology of large animal plant interactions of animals that we've never directly seen.
4601960	4615960	But it's like if you know that there is a really large seed and you know that there's seed dispersing mammals, then it can lead you to hypothesize that there was a seed disperser that was large enough to eat avocados whole.
4616960	4624960	And so we can look at anachronism in the current moments and help us, you know, retrace the past.
4624960	4641960	So just like the avocado is an anachronistic trait with such large seeds given to the current ecology, past ecology, we can see cancer as this anachronistic reversion to a previous mode of information integration and goal setting.
4641960	4650960	That it's like it's inappropriate in the context of the goals of the body, but not necessarily within the goals of a single cell that just wakes up one day.
4650960	4656960	It's like, wow, I'm bathed in glucose. I should replicate. So can't blame that cell.
4656960	4663960	Also like the cancer, a lot of the markers in cancer cells are really like it's like a developmental reversion.
4663960	4669960	So not sure if you guys are aware of that or not, but it's like they, they revert to like a more immature cellular phenotype.
4670960	4675960	And so that the, I mean, it's literally like going back to the past. So it's interesting.
4677960	4678960	Yep. Steminess.
4679960	4680960	Yes. Steminess.
4682960	4688960	Are there degrees of reversion? Like, is there something to be learned from the degree of reversion?
4693960	4694960	I'm not sure.
4695960	4704960	There's one thing that comes to mind there is there's some cancers where it goes back to like a stem cell of that tissue.
4704960	4710960	So like it's like a white blood cell cancer that like replicates a lot of white blood cells.
4710960	4721960	But when there is a cancer in a reproductive organ, sometimes it's like called a teratoma because it can have like hair and nails and stuff like that.
4721960	4727960	Because it's actually pulled back so far that it can then differentiate on all the pathways.
4729960	4740960	Rather than a reversion up from being like a healthy reproducing white blood cell precursor to just a higher white blood cell stem lineage.
4740960	4744960	But it doesn't pull back all the way to including ectoderm.
4744960	4748960	Whereas if it was in a reproductive cell, then it could do that.
4752960	4755960	Cool. Biofilms.
4755960	4757960	Do you want to take this one, Daniel?
4757960	4764960	Yep. So I think the key point here is that bacteria have ion channels just like metazones do.
4764960	4769960	You know, dopamine, GPCRs, the proteins that signal between neurons.
4769960	4771960	Those are not innovations of mammals.
4771960	4773960	They're not innovations of vertebrates.
4773960	4778960	Those kinds of channels and diffusable molecules are cellular.
4779960	4787960	And so what's being shown here is just like in previous figures, we saw one kind of eukaryotic cell, right?
4787960	4789960	You knew because it had a nucleus.
4789960	4794960	We have one eukaryote connecting with a few other eukaryotes.
4794960	4803960	Well, here we have one prokaryote connecting with other prokaryotes to do the exact same thing, which is increase its sensory capacity.
4804960	4808960	Again, not instantaneously, but think time-tone, light-tone.
4808960	4817960	And so in the same way that the eukaryotic cells form a cognitive individual through their associations and affordances such as the gap junctions,
4817960	4825960	bacteria, when they form a biofilm, can also form a larger cognitive integrated individual.
4825960	4831960	And you can still say, well, but from an evolutionary point of view, the unit of selection is the single bacteria.
4832960	4835960	But that's the evolutionary individuality definition.
4835960	4847960	And when we use the cognitive individuality definition, we see a lot of similarities between a multicellular organism's tissue and then a multicellular biofilm tissue.
4847960	4854960	Even not in a biofilm, I mean, bacteria have an incredible ability to like, I mean, it's like antibiotic resistance, right?
4854960	4859960	Like they do plasma exchange, which isn't like their chromosomal DNA, but it's like small little snips of DNA.
4860960	4863960	Like they just like have a handshake, like it's like a bacterial handshake.
4863960	4866960	Like now I'm going to give you some antibiotic resistance too.
4866960	4869960	Like we spread germs like COVID and bacteria to one another.
4869960	4874960	They spread plasmids to one another, which confer different properties.
4874960	4880960	And then we select for this like antibiotic resistance through the use of all of our like antibacterials.
4880960	4884960	And so only bacteria that have these little plasmids survive.
4884960	4885960	It's really interesting.
4885960	4894960	So even outside of a biofilm, they do some some kind of, you know, communication and like cognitive expansion of their self in like the way that we do with our inner circle of friends.
4898960	4900960	Cool. All right. Key ideas.
4900960	4905960	I just highlighted a few of these like points, but there's a huge box in the paper.
4905960	4908960	So we'll just read through the highlighted parts here.
4908960	4909960	I'll take this one.
4910960	4921960	First, a unified integrated cognitive self or individual can be defined with respect to the integrated ability to pursue specific goals via a homeostatic process that resists perturbations.
4922960	4934960	Second, an agent's cognitive world can be quantified and characterized enabling comparison with others regardless of their material implementation by estimating the spatiotemporal boundaries of its area of concern.
4935960	4943960	The volume and space and time over which the agent is able to take measurements, exert influence and functionally link disparate events, learning and association.
4944960	4955960	Three, the borders of the temporal and spatial events of which a given system is capable of measuring and acting map out a cognitive light cone, a boundary in the informational space of a mind.
4956960	4961960	So estimating the spatiotemporal boundaries of an agent is something I find particularly interesting.
4961960	4965960	So I just put that in as a question at the bottom to read some of the next ones.
4965960	4966960	Daniel.
4967960	4979960	Yep. So these are some key ideas for five six four cancer is reversible shrinking of the computational boundary of a biosystem pretty tantalizing there with the reversible.
4979960	4983960	I'm sure that's something that a lot of people would like to see.
4983960	4989960	Maybe the idea is you remind the rogue agents about bigger goal.
4989960	4998960	Like, hey, you know, I know you're hungry, but we wait in line at this restaurant so that everybody gets what takes care of them.
4998960	5002960	And maybe that helps remove the cancerous restaurant tour.
5002960	5011960	Five agents scaled up by evolving from basic homeostatic loops driven by active inference, which is surprise minimization.
5012960	5025960	By the addition of delays, which are memory anticipation, which is inference inference has planning as inference and networks, which is spatially distributed processing, enabling learning and progressive abstraction
5025960	5027960	generalization data.
5027960	5038960	That's pretty cool to see active inference and elaborations of active inference at the heart of this future electrical Evo eco vivo.
5038960	5049960	It's like saying you start with action and perception, and then you can carry that forward in time planning anticipation have extended trail of memory.
5049960	5053960	That's, you know, the past, and then you can also expand spatially.
5053960	5055960	But again, the spatial isn't instantaneous.
5055960	5058960	There's a propagation speed in the media.
5058960	5063960	And so even laterally similar agents interact through this light cone way.
5063960	5067960	So nice to see where active inference plays into light cones there.
5067960	5075960	And then six info taxes, the drive for better actionable intelligence about the regularities and patterns in the world.
5075960	5080960	And in the agents own mechanism encourages cells to connect in groups via signaling.
5080960	5090960	This is another area where active inference has a lot to say and is a value add relative to a reward only framework like reinforcement learning.
5090960	5096960	Because again, what drives the bacteria to cover less into work together.
5096960	5105960	So maybe it's reward, but then you have to appeal to this idea that they're maximizing reward with their behavior and the state or leave and all this kind of stuff.
5105960	5125960	Infotaxis helps us understand that the way to get good actionable intelligence, which is kind of like active inference a I right there is to make your actions exist on the trade off frontier like the Pareto optimal trade off between getting it done right now and expanding
5125960	5127960	your epistemic boundaries.
5127960	5134960	Sometimes the right move is to contact somebody who knows better or to go to a website that might inform you better.
5134960	5141960	And so it's actually a useful action in the moments to arrange to get better information later.
5141960	5148960	And so active inference helps us think about how these different needs are traded off by organisms.
5148960	5150960	Cool.
5150960	5155960	All right, so seven collecting into. Oh, I can't do it.
5155960	5158960	Syncium, syncytium, syncytium.
5158960	5160960	Did I do it?
5160960	5170960	Okay, collecting into a syncytium enables all of the cells to share the same data and access the same memories.
5170960	5172960	That's pretty awesome.
5172960	5173960	You must assimilate.
5173960	5176960	It's like the Borg.
5176960	5178960	Sorry, Star Wars nerd.
5178960	5192960	Okay, also greed, eight greed at the single cell level for information info taxes drives cooperativity as each unit expands its measurement boundary communication with neighbors, and thus inevitable
5192960	5198960	inevitably becomes part of a bigger self with bigger set points, serving as homeostatic attractors.
5199960	5205960	So I think active inference also has a role to play here in this cooperativity.
5205960	5213960	So like I can reduce my uncertainty about my environment by cooperating with people who have the same goal that I have, right?
5213960	5222960	Like or cooperating becoming part of a group, you know, and therefore our efforts make a bigger effort or bigger.
5222960	5227960	Anyway, less surprise when I'm in a bigger group because it expands that that light cone, right?
5227960	5228960	And then nine.
5228960	5235960	There's a fundamental symmetry between anatomical control mechanisms and cognitive mechanisms.
5235960	5241960	And I think that this was discussed in terms of bio electricity in the paper.
5241960	5243960	Do you guys have anything to add?
5243960	5247960	One thought on that is cooperation arising at a higher level.
5247960	5255960	So that just reminds me of like if you're looking through a microscope and you saw cell A eats cell B, you go, I mean adversarial relationship, right?
5255960	5257960	Could there be anything more directly adversarial?
5257960	5263960	And then you pull back and it's a white blood cell, you know, that's attacking a cancer cell.
5263960	5269960	So it's cooperative at a higher level, but it can look adversarial at a low level.
5269960	5274960	And so what does that map on to in different systems?
5274960	5283960	Can we reimagine conflict and tension as actually playing a stabilizing or cooperative role at a larger scale?
5283960	5291960	Can interpersonal differences in perspective or disagreements lead to a cooperative or regenerative collective?
5291960	5295960	This is what we hopefully move towards.
5295960	5302960	I saw some pigeons procreating yesterday while I was out walking around in my neighborhood and it definitely looked adversarial.
5302960	5308960	It looked very, very adversarial, but they're cooperating at a higher level.
5308960	5311960	Looks can be deceiving.
5312960	5313960	Okay, definitely.
5313960	5321960	I was thinking of a case where like if a tiger attacked me, I should just assume that it's like an information transfer that needs to happen.
5321960	5322960	I don't know.
5322960	5324960	Come get a piece with it.
5324960	5326960	I was thinking on that, Sarah.
5326960	5330960	Oh, it's like in the selfish gene by Dawkins.
5330960	5333960	He says, yeah, why would you go beyond the gene?
5333960	5334960	Doesn't make any sense.
5334960	5339960	You know, would you have mammals like doing kind acts for each other?
5339960	5341960	Just look at the lion eating the gazelle.
5341960	5344960	How could that possibly be a collaborative relationship?
5344960	5357960	And I thought, what if those two populations stabilize each other through a deep time and they can't coexist and then they actually persist better both because of that one act?
5357960	5361960	So who's to say?
5361960	5368960	But just one thing, like if that is all the case, you know, if this is all like whatever man, the universe becoming.
5368960	5371960	Why would it be that we have such a hard time with it?
5371960	5372960	Like shouldn't it?
5372960	5376960	Shouldn't there be some mechanism that allows me to just be like, oh, okay, cool.
5376960	5379960	You know, I don't get that.
5379960	5382960	I think the mechanism is narrative.
5382960	5384960	Cognitively.
5384960	5389960	It might play out differently in different systems, but agree to disagree.
5389960	5391960	It's a narrative that we can both agree on.
5391960	5393960	We're cooperating at that narrative level.
5393960	5395960	Doesn't mean that we don't disagree.
5395960	5403960	In fact, we entrenched that we disagree, but we're agreeing at a higher level.
5403960	5404960	Cool.
5404960	5408960	Do you want to read the next ones?
5408960	5421960	So yeah, just a few of the key points from 1011 1210 bioelectric integration helped evolve control strategies and cognitive content across the continuum from chemical networks to human minds.
5422960	5440960	11 the key points here where that there's a scale in variance with how different systems make decisions and that we can across different systems study how the cybernetic processes of learning and parameter optimization are implemented by a large number of units pursuing
5440960	5453960	Infotaxis and homeostatic goals a.k.a. pragmatic value and epicenter value and 12 a conceptual unification is proposed in this paper as scale free cognition.
5453960	5467960	And then it's talked about how these boundaries between different subunits are a major control mob between the self and the world like the sound is doing the same stuff whether it's part of an organism or part of a cancer.
5467960	5476960	But it's actually this control knob like what are the limits of the cognitive individual that sets the cell up to act a certain way or another.
5476960	5486960	And then a reminder at the very end from a utilitarian perspective that the most appropriate level of analysis is to be determined empirically.
5486960	5489960	Aha, but was empiricism determined empirically.
5490960	5498960	And that is said to be the level that facilitates prediction control with the least effort by the experimenter or by the system itself.
5498960	5506960	What if they disagree and gives rise to a unified understanding that drives the most novel, robust research programs at the bench.
5506960	5511960	Nice, you know, if it doesn't advance your career as a scientist.
5511960	5513960	And it's not the case.
5514960	5521960	This was you Daniel active inference and multi scale communication.
5521960	5525960	Just wanted to capture a little bit about multi scale systems and active.
5525960	5529960	So here we have nested systems on top left, you know, that's an answering.
5529960	5533960	That's a picture that Sasha took of an answering that came from a Pogo ants.
5533960	5540960	And then there's the colony with a bunch of nest mates driving food around and then the colony is embedded within an ecosystem.
5541960	5548960	So within one nested system, you know, within these time diamonds that are sort of nested inside of each other.
5548960	5559960	We can think about how the internal state of one is linked to the external state being the next level up like the internal state is the brain and the external niche to the brain is the body.
5559960	5568960	Okay, now the body and the brain are the internal state for what the colony and then the colony is like the internal state for the ecological niche.
5568960	5576960	So that's something that we've seen before with how active inference helps us understand and model and simulate hierarchically nested systems.
5576960	5589960	But also we can think about interactions at the same scale like collective behavior, collective intelligence as occurring when at the same type of agents, they're interacting like laterally.
5589960	5591960	And so that's this teal arrow.
5591960	5596960	That's where you have two agents there are there each other's external state.
5596960	5608960	So active inference helps us zoom up and out and down and in, and then also helps us go laterally, and then not to repeat it too many times but the lateral transmission isn't instantaneous.
5608960	5617960	It's dynamic it happens through time, which means that we don't need to look at all lateral interactions just the time cone.
5620960	5621960	Cool.
5622960	5624960	Predictions and research program.
5624960	5628960	There was a big list here so I just pulled a few of them out.
5628960	5632960	I'll read some of these off, which are a lot of them questions.
5632960	5638960	So is there a quantifiable sense in which biological systems model themselves?
5638960	5654960	Can an in silico evolutionary system be built containing both genetic and physiological components, which simulates the scheme described above homeostasis and infotaxis and illustrates the emergence of different scales of cognitive horizons over time?
5654960	5662960	Can we directly observe the evolution of multicellular goals from networking of agents with single cell homeostatic goals?
5662960	5677960	Might there be higher level effects on the physiological boundaries of the cognitive sub agents within the body from exposure to psychedelics, which have long been claimed to expand transpersonal boundaries or induce ego death?
5677960	5687960	The analogies between geometric spaces and cognitive ones need to be explored further as is beginning to be done via geometric information theory.
5687960	5689960	Time diamond anyone?
5689960	5690960	Definitely.
5690960	5693960	I think that there's a lot of room to go here.
5693960	5698960	Will complex engineered systems set novel goals and if so how?
5698960	5708960	It is a prediction of this view that adaptive useful robotics will require components that are themselves competent and goal seeking.
5708960	5716960	That is super interesting also because really as an intelligent being capable of cognition so are all of my parts.
5716960	5724960	So if we're going to really import you know give rise to intelligent life intelligent artificial life.
5724960	5726960	We have to start with intelligent artificial components.
5726960	5728960	I think that's super cool.
5728960	5730960	And also goals.
5730960	5736960	We can't we can't just say well let's just build you know a bigger car or a bigger computer.
5736960	5744960	I mean what do we want this intelligence design system to be intelligence in the service of or in the way of.
5744960	5750960	And it's a disaster waiting to build capacity without goal.
5750960	5752960	For sure.
5752960	5754960	Do you want to read some more of these?
5754960	5757960	Yep so the second set of predictions.
5757960	5761960	So this is where Mike is setting out a little bit of his agenda.
5761960	5764960	The next work in this subfield.
5764960	5767960	Just you know the subfield each of the fields they're modular.
5767960	5772960	They have their own disciplinary histories their own disciplinary anticipation.
5772960	5778960	But this subfield should focus on the discovery of bioelectric communication inducing technology.
5778960	5785960	So just like once we had chemical biology people were really excited about finding drugs that bound to proteins.
5785960	5792960	Well now that we're aware of bioelectricity let's think about manipulations and measurements of bioelectricity.
5793960	5803960	Two it's a prediction that it's possible to induce the formation of metazoan like bodies in an otherwise unicellular organism by forcing the expression of appropriate
5803960	5805960	electrogenic proteins and gap junctions.
5805960	5810960	So he's trying to get towards some unique predictions and experiments.
5810960	5822960	A prediction that transcriptomic which means gene expression analysis of regeneration events from bacterial biofilms plants and metazoan models of limb regeneration.
5822960	5831960	Should so show consistent use of electrogenic proteins in the events that enable cooperation towards self limiting morphogenetic cascades.
5831960	5846960	So it's kind of like the structure informational or cognitive structure of recovery and repair might have some similarities across systems that wouldn't immediately be seen as similar otherwise.
5846960	5851960	Scale free cognition hypothesis suggests that multi human systems.
5851960	5855960	Kafka remote teams could have their own degree of cognition.
5856960	5863960	So as we always say no things that the brain knows that the neuron doesn't things that the colony knows that the ants nest mate doesn't.
5863960	5870960	There's got to be things that remote teams or any other kind of team know that individual participants don't know.
5870960	5876960	And then the exobiology question is given a novel life form or just a novel form.
5876960	5880960	How does one know when successful communication has taken place.
5880960	5892960	And that's an interesting question for a lot of you Zeno slash exobiologists said anyone.
5892960	5893960	Cool.
5893960	5894960	Next slide.
5894960	5898960	So this is in the section what it feels like to be a pancreas.
5898960	5906960	But I really pulled the point that kind of hit home for me the most out of the section and the final point that Mike makes in the paper.
5906960	5908960	So I'll just read this off.
5908960	5925960	It is striking that the process which Zen practice is meant to reverse attachment to past memories and high valence for future expectations or fears is precisely the process suggested to be responsible for the creation of complex cells with a capital S.
5925960	5933960	It is unclear whether it is beneficial or even possible to truly live in the moment and let go of past memories and future expectations.
5933960	5940960	But anyone who succeeded in doing this would achieve precisely what Zen promises the dissolution of the self.
5940960	5957960	And the final sentence of the paper which I just love recreating the unification into and liberation from larger scale unifying unifying cells with a capital S would be a true pinnacle of synthetic biology and artificial intelligence engineering.
5957960	5958960	Wow.
5958960	5961960	This is a good paper.
5961960	5963960	So just keep questions at the end.
5963960	5965960	What might a good understanding of this work enable?
5965960	5968960	What are the unique predictions and implications of this work?
5968960	5973960	What are the next steps for FEP and active inference in relation to this work?
5973960	5977960	What are the goals of this research and what are you still curious about?
5977960	5985960	So we will be thinking of all of these things as we get ready to do 25.1 and 25.2 over the next couple weeks.
5985960	5987960	So thank you for participating.
