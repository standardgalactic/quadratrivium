0	17160	Hello and welcome. It's July 29th, 2023, and we're here in session three discussion of
17160	22120	the course, Physicist Information Processing at the Active Inference Institute. We're having
22120	29600	a follow-up discussion on Chris Fields' third lecture on quantum reference frames, and we're
29600	35080	looking forward to your participation. So if you're watching along live and you've been invited
35080	41000	to the calendar event, it's not too late to jump in. If you're watching on YouTube, you can write
41000	48440	any questions or comments in the live chat with Dean and Andrew here. We're gonna be looking at
48440	55280	some of the key points and taking it in a few different directions, sharing our reference
55280	63200	frames, making a shared one. So Andrew, be awesome to have you zoom in a little bit on the slide,
63200	73080	and then feel free to take us through some of the key points so that we can see a little bit
73080	82920	how you're seeing it. Thank you. That looks good. Yep. Okay, so let's start by reviewing the last
82920	88120	lecture from a couple weeks ago, and then we can open up the discussions if there's any questions
88120	96240	that appear in the live chat. We can address those. All right, so lecture two, Chris introduced
97120	104400	this idea of the information processing between system AMB, you know, where they interact via
104400	115040	qubits on a boundary, and they have reference frames that give meaning to this communication.
115040	124320	You want to think of information processing as a communication channel, the way Shannon thought
124400	129840	about it. So that was the lecture two, and lecture three a couple weeks ago,
132320	139520	tried to make this more explicit by emphasizing the idea that this has to be physically embodied
139520	146800	somewhere. Okay, and I think that because we are so used to information being fungible,
147600	155040	you know small part because of the internet and everything. It's a little hard to understand
155040	160720	at first when the claim is made that you have a QRM, that it's non-fungible, or you have a piece
160720	164480	of quantum information that's non-fungible, or things like the no-cloning theorem,
165360	173520	we're so used to information being fungible to it being zeroes and ones, that it's a bit of a
173520	180000	change in mindset at first, but that's exactly what lecture three introduced.
181120	187280	This was all stuff, right? Could you maybe just unpack that a little bit? What would it mean for
187920	192560	information to be fungible, or what's that stance like, and then what does it mean for
192560	199760	information to be non-fungible, and what is that stance like? Yeah, I'm allowed to get there. So
200320	204720	let me scroll down the slides because that's addressed here. So I was maybe I should have
204720	210720	kept this in the beginning, but anyways, session two talked about how information theory makes
210720	218880	this simple and obvious, okay? And in session three, we talk about reference frames and
218880	225600	mechanistically how all of this works. So yeah, let's address that question of the difference between
225760	232880	between, hold on one second, let me use my mouse to scroll down here.
235520	244160	Okay, so that's a little faster, right? Okay, so can you restate your question, Daniel?
244160	250320	Yeah, what would it mean for information to be fungible or non-fungible? People might be familiar
250320	255120	with that in the economic setting with non-fungible tokens and all of that, but what are we talking
255120	260720	about with informational fungibility? I think it basically comes down to
263200	266560	whether you can replicate. I mean, it's basically the difference between classical
266560	272880	and quantum information. As far as I know, fungible information is everything that you can
272880	281200	basically turn into a message of zeros and ones. It's, you know, how you transmit it may be different,
281280	285120	you know, the channel, the physical hardware and so on, but at the end of the day,
286640	289440	it's something that you can write on a boundary and something that you can
290320	293040	transmit as zeros and ones. Whereas quantum information,
295280	300560	you literally have to send the hardware, the piece of hardware, the QRF. At least that's how I
300560	309840	understand it. So a simple answer might be that it's information encoded in a piece of software
309840	316720	versus a piece of hardware, but I don't think that analogy is perfect. Dean, what do you think?
318720	324800	Here's what I'm curious about. And again, you guys can help me with this. As opposed to reference
324800	332000	frames, I oftentimes default to frame of reference. And I know that in one of the live streams,
332000	337360	what I tried to bring out was the idea that there was an ice cream cone looking at an ice cream truck.
337920	344960	And the question was always whether or not, which one of those two entities, one is in the foreground
344960	350080	and one is in the background. And in this slide that Andrew has up, the question is,
351120	362080	is the non-fundability because only A and B can decide whether the A, the VA as seen by B,
362080	372320	the A is deeper into that image based on our frame of reference and the B is closer or is the B,
372320	377840	the one that's actually deeper and the A is the one that's in the foreground. And I was wondering
377840	385280	whether the idea of non-copyability is because of that depth of field aspect that cannot be
385280	391520	determined unless it's literally handed over the way that Chris was describing it.
392320	400320	I think that's basically accurate. I'm not sure that I can answer the question, but I think
401040	406480	I have the feeling that Chris said this in the lecture that, I mean, at the end of the day,
406480	416480	the QRF is somewhere in your nervous system. And here, whether, I mean, you bring up a good
416480	422800	point, right? It looks like this slide is a bit of an optical illusion. Whether you see A or B
422800	429920	deeper, I guess it depends on something going on inside your head. If you, this picture is so
429920	436880	symmetrical that if you focus an app on it, you can change your opinion. Well, just to even
437760	443120	connect that to what we're talking about, the classical fungible information on the holographic
443120	451600	screen on the blanket and then quantum cognitive rotation is those two images are on the screen
452240	460160	identical. And then whether it gets a quantum rotation such that the three points of the axes
460800	467040	are closer to us than the intersection on that kind of tetrahedron or the other way around,
467040	472560	whether the ballerina is rotating one way or the other, that's not on the boundary. So the
472560	480000	information about the depth of field is part of the QRF or part of the enactment of the QRF.
480000	488800	And it's not written on the boundary. And that goes back to the preparation question and not
488800	495120	just the measuring. Yeah, like at the preparation, if your whole enculturation or the last five minutes,
496080	503120	it was entrained or you were holding an object that predisposed you to think that the vertex of
503120	509040	the intersection was further away. That's the preparation that sets your prior so that when
509040	518640	you get this ambiguous artifact, you rotate it into the most natural position cognitively. And
518640	522080	that's the preparation that sets you up for measurement. No measurement can happen without
522080	530080	a preparation. What do you think, Andrew? Sure. Yeah, everything you said makes sense.
532720	543360	So perhaps let me recall what I said around the slides. There was a, in this whole spirit or
543360	549840	philosophy of making, emphasizing that information is physical, you know, income from QV, this whole
549840	561200	thing. One of the glaring omissions in physics was the embodiment of the reference frame,
561200	568480	which was treated as an abstraction, you know, in classical physics, such as by Galileo. But
568480	574640	maybe even Einstein, even if he, my hunch is that he did have more of this instinct of, you know,
574640	580080	particularly in all those thought experiments of trying to chase the library, you are chasing
580080	586400	the library, right? So at the end of the day. But I mean, this is a whole process of making
586400	590320	the observer and the reference frame more and more explicit and more and more physical,
591280	597440	because at the end of the day, it has to, right? If you start with this assumption that
598000	606080	so it is the assumption almost that, you know, all you see and, you know, it's part of the same
606720	614320	material ether that you are, then, you know, then you are part of the universe that you're
614320	621040	observing something that is out there. So you need to make, include a theory of what it means for
621040	625760	you to be observing that, right? And at the end of the day, the observer has to be physical.
625760	631840	That's what was emphasized by Chris at the beginning of this lecture. So this jump from
631840	643440	treating the reference frame as an abstraction to a real physical entity. Yeah, these people have
645200	651680	talked a lot about in these papers that are put in there, but I should also remark
652240	658880	that if folks want to see this, it's coming up in high energy theory also, in recent work of
658880	666960	Saskin and others, where they talk about quantum reference frames, very explicitly. So I don't
666960	672960	have the citations of the but, but it's definitely becoming an important thing in the last 20 years.
674000	678800	This attempt to really explicitly treat the reference frame and the observer as a quantum
679200	688240	entity, as a physical entity. Okay, so this, that's what I just said. Okay, the jump from
688240	697040	treating things, reference frames as abstractions to physical objects. Go. And
700160	706800	and because we cannot make a perfect copy of quantum information, we say that these are
706800	714800	unique and clonable and unfungible. So in order to recreate an experiment perfectly,
715920	720560	this is that this is addressed as the part of fungibility or not, right? Can Alice,
720560	726000	if you have some sort of quantum experiment and Alice and Bob are, you know, it's the usual
726960	733680	EPR thought experiment or whatever Alice and Bob are separated by light years.
734640	741360	Is it enough if they want to recreate the same exact, the same experiment or Alice to send
742160	749360	string of zeros and ones? Well, if you had an experiment where that's enough, then you can
749360	754720	recreate it with fungible information. If not, then you need to somehow send non-fungible
754720	758400	information, which really implies standing a piece of hardware.
759120	771200	Um, can I, can I add another, another piece here? Look on the previous slide. So this looks
771760	778960	really technical and scientific. But let's think about Alice's laboratory is Alice's
778960	785840	brain, mind and Bob's analogously. Alice is thinking about what to say, and then says it.
786480	791600	And that information might be written in a chat form. It might be said verbally,
791600	796960	it might be transmitted through digital or analog signal. But at some point,
796960	802160	it's going through this classical informational interface. And then Bob's laboratory is like
802160	808960	perceiving and unpacking it. And the question of semantic alignment is such that if Alice gives
808960	815440	a shopping list of 10 items, if there's semantic alignment, Bob would be able to go to the store
815440	821920	and then find those 10 items. And it made me think of the, the dictionary definition of left
821920	827520	and right. So this gets back to our discussion of whether the vertex on these axes is coming
827520	832000	towards us or away from us. So I looked up the deck, the dictionary definition of left
833360	839440	on towards or relating to the side of a human body or of a thing that is to the west when the
839440	846000	person or that thing is facing north. So that's, I guess, one attempt to anchor what it means to
846000	850960	be left. The second definition is the left hand part, side or direction. And you could imagine
850960	856960	there's an analogous definition for right. The point is, you can't describe verbally
858000	866480	leftness and rightness or chirality in general, because its reference is an embodied perspective.
867440	872560	And so if Alice said, okay, you're going to go down the street and then turn left at the stop sign,
874080	882640	how would Alice communicate to Bob what leftness meant at that stop sign versus rightness?
884480	891200	And that's this question of flipping. And the way that the quantum formalism accommodates that
891200	896960	is through the WIC rotation and the quantum cognitive events, where the fungible,
898080	904480	transmittable holographic information gets rotated into the imaginary axis
905440	910480	with the formalisms that enable it to be rotated at all. But that means you could
910480	920080	rotate it left quote or rotate it right. Yeah, I think that's, that's a very good explanation.
920160	923200	I don't know if I have much to add, Dean, do you want me to say something?
924960	932320	So, but I can't, I don't know the answer to this, but to take what Daniel just said, to take the
932320	942320	basic concept of being able to take something that for all intents and purposes can appear one way
942320	950000	or another. And then turn that into how Chris closed the last lecture with, we are, we are
950000	959920	seeing ourselves as both being entangled and also being separatable. How did we go literally from
960640	970320	a three dimension vertex to we're both entangled and we're, we're not living in a paradox. That's
970320	978240	just the way it is. We're also removing ourselves or separating ourselves at the same time.
978240	985280	That's what I would like to know because somewhere between three arbitrary lines and
985920	992640	complexity is not a paradox. Something has to be happening and I'm not exactly sure how that
992640	1004240	transition plays out. Anybody want to enlighten me? Can you repeat your question please? Well,
1004240	1011360	how do we, how do we go like from the, at this point of the reference frame description of
1011360	1022240	saying it can't, you can't copy it. All you can do is pass it because we think things could be flipped
1022240	1028960	based on internal, internal reference frames, internal meanings and internal models. The thing
1028960	1039520	we choose for context goes all the way out to the conclusion of Chris's conversation with us in
1039520	1047520	number three where he said, bottom line is, is that it's not a paradox that as things become more
1047520	1056880	and more complex, then it wants to be able, it wants to get to a place of entanglement, alignment,
1057520	1065200	a sense of agreement and at the same time wants to remain separate. So between those two things,
1066160	1072240	a whole lot has happened but, and I don't think we've skipped over it, but we certainly haven't
1073200	1079680	opened it up and really looked at it closely and I'm just curious, what's in between those two
1079680	1086240	scales? I agree. I think we're, we're going to cover that towards the end of the, of the talk,
1087280	1093920	but I agree. I mean, I don't know how you see this related to QRS or the stuff we just talked about,
1093920	1097760	but I think it's the big question in this, in this lecture, right? That was like,
1097840	1106000	where does this tension between increasing complexity and, you know, wanting, wanting to predict
1106000	1111520	what the environment is doing? One requires entanglement and one requires separability, at
1111520	1120880	least colloquially speaking. I think this tension is basically what the free energy principle comes
1120880	1126560	down to, right? Daniel, what do you think? You have the free energy and you have the E minus TS
1127680	1132640	one is prediction error. I mean, not exactly E minus TS, right? That would be the dynamics, but
1132640	1140320	you know what I mean? One is prediction error and the other one is, what was it? I can't remember.
1142800	1147760	I'll definitely look forward to the, the technical unpacking that, that you'll get to soon, but,
1147760	1154560	but I was reminded of the William Blake quotation, do what you will, this life's a fiction and is made
1154560	1162880	up of contradiction. So let's modify that, project what you will, rotate what you will,
1163600	1169280	space times a fiction, not that it's false, but that it's a projected fictionalization,
1170000	1174560	that it doesn't have the ontological primacy that, that's apology of communication does,
1175120	1181760	and is made up of contradiction. Yes. And it's made up of this tension between
1184080	1191760	fitting and not overfitting between aligning and the principle of unitarity and differentiating and
1191760	1199600	becoming through others, we become ourselves and that type of articulation and recognizing that two
1199680	1207440	complementary forces like convex and concave come into existence at once, like a zero to two jump
1209680	1216720	is not an issue or a stumbling block. It's that we wouldn't have it any other way.
1218400	1226240	Couldn't have it any other way. Yeah. Sure. We'll get that towards the end. You can almost
1226320	1232000	even call it a duality. It's not far fetch. I mean, it's the sort of thing that I think most
1232000	1238320	people will be happy to take for granted such supersymmetry, like you have two kinds of particles,
1238320	1244000	but the same amount of them and dualities that are all over the place. So I think it's fairly,
1244800	1250720	it's not unreasonable to just accept that there is a tension between increasing complexity, which
1251680	1258400	you want you want me to be separable for and accuracy prediction. Now, how this is related to
1260000	1268320	emergent space. And this QRF stuff, you know, I don't want to make very far fetch claims,
1268320	1273760	we'll talk about emergent space later on the course. But for now, let's, let's, let's say a
1273760	1278400	few more words out here. And then we'll get to the complexity stuff towards the end.
1279360	1290800	So, so QRFs are almost building blocks if you want for information processing. Here it's very
1291760	1297760	useful to recall the definition that I feel. I think we, we have mentioned before
1298720	1304160	of information as being differences that make a difference. That's probably the best
1305120	1310480	definition of information I've heard. And I think, I think it does a lot of work. I mean,
1310480	1315440	it's almost mathematical. But anyways, we need to unpack it a little more and see. So
1316400	1323520	for a difference to make a difference, what do you want out of QRF, right? And surprisingly,
1323520	1331920	I mean, not surprisingly, but reassuringly, I think would be the word. You need a QRF to have
1331920	1341600	sensory action and a default state, right? This is sort of like
1342640	1349600	where your Bayesian prior distribution is encoded. These three things will give you a building block
1349600	1356720	for any information processing. And that, you know, ties together with all the work in the
1357280	1366960	pre-energy literature and perception action loops and whatnot. So before we see mathematically
1368480	1375840	how a QRF is defined, I think it's more illustrative. And I think Chris, when exactly on the right
1375840	1384640	order, when he presented this a couple of weeks ago, seen examples from nature. These are actual
1384640	1392960	pieces of forward are effectively QRFs. And it's remarkable how they map to, well, I'll skip ahead
1392960	1398960	a little bit. But when you get to them, to the mathematical definition of the QRF as a quantum
1398960	1406080	system that, you know, you can specify with this category theory diagram, you know, you have
1406080	1411440	incoming arrows into a node that then expands, right? And this roughly corresponds to measurement
1411440	1416800	and preparation degrees of, not degrees of freedom, degrees of freedom would be the same,
1416800	1421120	right, when you attach it to the boundary. But measurement and preparation stages, I guess,
1421120	1429280	would be the better word. But anyways, let me go back to these examples, right? And Daniel,
1429280	1436880	your biologist here, so correct me if I say anything wrong here. You have a cartoon picture
1436880	1444240	of the bacteria, I think. And this is a very simple sort of thing, right? It navigates in the
1444240	1454000	direction of food. And, and that's it, right? So it is a very simple rudimentary example of a QRF.
1454720	1456480	You have the sensory
1457200	1464560	stage here, I guess, the degrees of freedom. I guess the degrees of freedom,
1466320	1473360	it's not obvious here what the boundary is. That's one thing. But it is a good enough picture to see
1473360	1479200	the resemblance to here. We have the measurement, which in this, in this case, you're trying to
1479200	1491120	measure concentration of food. You have your node here, C, which is your prior distribution for
1491120	1497200	concentration of food. And finally, you have the output, the preparation stage, which is your,
1498160	1503680	you know, this, the rest of this chemical network that will control and steer this
1503680	1508560	bacterium, right? So there's here, you want to call it the action degrees of freedom
1510240	1513360	that will steer this bacterium in the direction of food.
1514160	1519520	And likewise with cell division, this I understand even less, the network appears more complicated.
1520880	1525520	But I think it's fair to say that at the end of the day, all these chemical networks
1526080	1532640	that appear super complicated, somehow have to be mapped to this
1535040	1541520	category theoretical diagram. That's the tolerance to it. You're going to have the sensory input
1542320	1549360	and the action output. And you're going to have the default chemical concentration, which
1550080	1552240	amounts to this, to this node over here.
1552800	1562480	You remember this from last lecture, right, Daniel? Yeah. And the cone cocoon we explored also in
1562480	1568880	live stream 17 on the Bayesian semantic information flow. But I'll kind of at a point about these
1568880	1578160	biological systems in relationship to artificially specified systems and what that helps us understand
1578160	1586000	about perception cognition action. So the cone cocoon diagram has this bow tie architecture,
1586000	1592960	or this kind of like two pyramids touching point to point, where there's a preparation
1592960	1598800	and a measurement, which can be different dimensionalities or different scopes,
1599440	1604880	like you could be multi input multi output or multi input single output vice versa and so on.
1605520	1613280	But they come through this eye of the needle with C prime here. Now contrast that kind of
1613280	1619600	architecture represented here abstractly with what we see in the bacterial process
1620320	1628560	and in the cell division process. These have that kind of a bow tie perception cognition
1628560	1636240	action architecture or measurement cognitive integration, preparation architecture.
1637600	1645760	In contrast, we see, for example, an artificial neural network, where the input and the output layers
1645760	1652720	are usually lower dimensional, maybe an image coming in with several hundred pixels and a
1652720	1658480	single output like a classifier coming out the other end, but a dimensional explosion
1659040	1665680	in those internal cognitive layers. But in biological systems, it's actually exactly the
1665680	1672560	opposite. For example, many, many, many receptors on the cell surface on the holographic boundary,
1672560	1678720	the sensorium of the cell. But then there are these common secondary messengers
1679600	1686320	that many pathways converge upon. So that reflects the kind of radically different
1687040	1696400	architecture that a QRF embodies, as opposed to the approach taken by disembodied intelligence
1696400	1704240	frameworks, which use dimensional explosion internally, to try to categorize and classify
1704240	1712000	and find find edge cases versus this dimensional winnowing that is reflective of these embodied
1712000	1721360	intelligences. And if I may make a tangential comment here also, I think the good thing about
1721360	1731280	these two examples is that they also showcase the fact of how, you know, the deep implications of
1731280	1736640	a scale free biology, if you want to call it this way. We tend to think of these sorts of processes,
1737200	1743840	right, such as here, only happening at the level of the nervous system in animals.
1744960	1748880	Or, as you said, neural networks, right, we tend to associate this with neural networks.
1749520	1756480	And perhaps evolution is theorizing a way that endowd us with nervous systems to make these
1756480	1763760	things, maybe these are higher up in the layers. But really, that's a bit of an arbitrary distinction
1763760	1769600	that we make. The processes going on at the cellular level, even if they don't appear to have
1769600	1777840	anything to do with the nervous system, my understanding is that there are some generic
1777840	1782400	properties that are the same and everything that has to do with information processing.
1782400	1789680	It manifests maybe slightly different when it comes to explicit nerves, but at the end of the day,
1790320	1793840	it's the same generic process going on. Would you say that's right, Daniel?
1796640	1802240	The ontological claim is that it's the same generic process happening, whereas the more
1802240	1808240	instrumentalist claim is that we can model it with some shared abstractions.
1809120	1814320	Yeah, okay, so we can continue, right?
1816480	1826480	So, from, you know, I don't have a whole lot to say, Daniel said quite a bit about,
1826480	1833200	at the end of the day, QRF is, you can visualize it as this diagram. And, you know, you can think of
1833760	1839760	it as, if you are more familiar with the picture of neural network and ways on a neural network
1839760	1847600	and so on, that's the way to think about it. Now, let's continue with explicit embodiment,
1847600	1856960	if you wish. So, QRFs in the formalism have to be attached to a boundary,
1857040	1861040	boundary, degree, supreme. And I should add another remark here, I think,
1862320	1869360	and personally, to me also, like the hard part about this quantum pre-energy
1869360	1873600	principle formalism, if you wish, is what you said at the beginning is the fact that it's
1873600	1877520	topological, right? So, very often it's not clear what the boundary, degree, supreme are,
1878400	1882000	right? Because we tend to think of boundaries as, you know,
1882320	1890560	geometrical, and certainly the classical FEP treats them as geometrical, but that's not the case here
1890560	1897520	in the quantum pre-energy formalism. And where we have merchant space, as we'll be talked about
1897520	1904720	in later sessions, that's just like one quick remark to make. At the end of the day, though,
1905600	1911120	even if it's topological, we're going to have real degrees of freedom that this
1912800	1919600	QRF is attached to, this cone-cocoon diagram. And you're going to have measurement operators that
1919600	1932240	yield classical outcomes, class of minus one. And then you can think of this QRF,
1932560	1939520	or more abstractly, this cone-cocoon diagram as a neural network, if you wish, acting on those
1939520	1946400	boundary qubits. And then backpropagating some sort of action signal preparation.
1949440	1960960	Okay, then let's not forget that the Landau's principle and so on requires that we are mindful
1960960	1967840	of energy constraints on computation. And that gives us the following picture.
1971920	1973600	Number one, we're going to have to
1976240	1983280	use energy from the environment to fuel our computation, to fuel our observation.
1984000	1990320	That means that right away, you cannot use the entirety of your boundary to gather information.
1990800	2001280	It necessitates an allocation of resources. Here, E is the observed environment,
2001840	2008560	and the blue portion is a thermodynamical sector, where you extract free energy and
2010480	2015040	heat in order to run this computational process. And then furthermore, you can have
2016000	2021520	a memory sector where you write things on the boundary. And this takes up energy also,
2021520	2025920	writing information on the boundary by Landau's principle. We'll take up information.
2027680	2030720	And Chris called this the minimal interest in observer,
2032480	2040240	because it has a memory sector. And why minimal here implies that we have at least
2041200	2047920	minimal interest thing implies that we have more than one layer. Here, the process of
2047920	2055600	writing things into a memory sector requires us to have a clock so that we can label
2055600	2061760	those memories in time. So we do have time as part of this formalism, just not space yet.
2062080	2066480	Okay. And time has to be internal to the observer.
2067680	2079200	Just one piece on that that Chris mentioned. And as you echoed, time here is an attribute of
2079200	2087040	some cognitive systems in terms of their internal understanding so that they can sort
2087760	2094720	memories and understand what came earlier or later. It's not something that's a priori defined
2094720	2101280	externally, which is the case in the kind of space time first. Now, how do we fit communication
2101280	2109120	into here? We flip that, we're talking about the topology of communication as ontologically
2109760	2116240	primal. And now certain kinds of sophisticated agents, that's not like necessarily true of rock
2116320	2123360	or a metronome or a particle of a gas, but some kinds of cognitive systems are such that they
2123360	2131040	are able to generate an internal clock concept. And that doesn't have to be the same thing as
2131040	2135760	what's happening on the wall with chronos. This can reflect a purely internal time,
2135760	2140800	kairos that enables observers or interactors that have different clock structures. And then
2140800	2148720	Landauer's principle helps us arbitrage or connect the informational demands to the energetic or
2148720	2157280	the metabolic demands. Bean? So when I first listened to the lecture, I thought when the
2159120	2168160	term or phrase trade off was raised, I traditionally have thought of trade off as kind of a binary.
2169120	2175360	If I'm picking this, I'm trading off against all the other things that I didn't pick,
2176160	2184800	so one or the other or others plural. But when I saw this, and especially when I heard it in
2184800	2193360	the context of things like degrees of freedom, I began to wonder whether it is because it could sit
2193360	2199680	on either side of that boundary. It could be a priori or it could be ad hoc or post hoc, a trade
2199680	2210080	off, which prior to this conversation, I just assumed that a trade off was one or the other.
2210880	2218720	But essentially what this implies is it isn't even, it's still a kind of a degree of
2219200	2226880	of how much weight you put into it. And then it kind of crossed a threshold and then you've made
2226880	2234720	your pick. You've completed your trade off. Or did I, again, did I misinterpret what I was
2235280	2243120	hearing? If it's topological, as opposed to the more conventional space time perspective.
2243600	2251520	Is this, can a trade off be both ad hoc and post hoc, seemingly at the same time?
2257760	2263280	Very interesting question. Let us just let it float and continue on, enter.
2264160	2273920	All right. Because again, if it's, I'll just say this, if it can be, that would really move us
2273920	2281200	out of the classical realm. That would essentially say that anytime we've made a pick,
2281760	2287280	we really haven't made a pick. There's still a whole bunch of other things that are going to happen
2288000	2297200	that can change whatever that action is that we thought we carried out or enacted.
2297760	2306480	If we're talking about an internality state, which is what I think we want,
2307040	2309200	I think we want to be able to change our minds.
2309440	2321920	Let me take that one way, Dean. The analytical equations of the action perception loop
2322880	2329520	don't tell us in implementation, like if we're going to write it in code, whether we should
2330480	2340800	use action first procedurally to update our observations, or whether we enable our observations
2341840	2348560	to wag the dog and then select action at the end of the loop. So is it a perception action loop,
2348560	2357520	or is it an action perception loop? And those enable a kind of seesaw where sometimes we want
2358480	2364960	what we learn to change what we do, and other times we want what we do to change what we learn,
2366000	2373680	and having that kind of a fulcrum or a pivot, and then again to connect it to the vertex popping
2373680	2380320	in and out, the analytical formalisms inscribed on the screen of the FEP, like the textbooks,
2380720	2388640	they're ambiguous whether we lead with action and have inference follow, or whether we lead
2388640	2395440	with inference and have action follow, or lead with action and have inference follow, whichever
2395440	2407040	one of the combinations there are, and then that trade-off or run-off is broken by specific
2407040	2416000	embodied cognitive agents. That trade-off about the procedural primacy of perception or action
2417520	2420480	can't be broken generically. Right.
2429680	2432160	It certainly makes for a lot of waste heat if you're not careful.
2437040	2438960	It'd be exhausting a lot anyway.
2442080	2453520	Okay, so I see, I don't know if we can talk about intent much with this formalism,
2454080	2461280	but we can take a very descriptive approach to it and go down here a little more.
2462240	2467680	Actually, before I don't want to get ahead of myself, what I mean by that is
2472160	2478640	whether we can put intent or not in this hierarchy, I don't know if it matters a whole lot,
2478640	2486800	but at least we can talk about it operationally and descriptively and say just like when you have a
2486880	2496720	clock, that clock is just there. If you don't have the clock, you don't have the memory,
2496720	2505760	and that's it. Unlikewise here, if we don't have an attention control compartment, we cannot play
2505760	2515840	with all these QRFs that are non-commutative at the same time. If there is no attention control
2515840	2521440	system to begin with, we cannot talk about a system that has non-commutative QRFs,
2521440	2525520	meaning here one presumably goes to memory sectors, the other one goes to environment
2525520	2538880	sectors and so on. This is certainly a necessity of the fact that we have different sectors of
2538880	2544080	the boundary being allocated to different purposes, such as environmental observation
2544720	2554080	and memory and so on. Within the environment, it's worth remarking that here if you think deeply
2554080	2561920	about first principles and what it means to observe an entity, well, you still come down
2561920	2567840	to these differences that make a difference sort of thing, which involves whenever you're looking
2567840	2574320	at the environment, if you're going to identify a system, you need sort of a background that tells you
2576400	2581440	that puts the system in context so that you can identify the system as something distinct.
2582160	2588640	I think this again is something that we have talked about in previous discussions, where
2589440	2595200	the easiest picture here is something like the speed gauge in your car, where
2596080	2605440	the P is the gauge itself that tells you the speed, but it's meaningless without the reference
2605440	2612800	system. Outside of the thing that stays invariant, the context, the background,
2614800	2621360	that gauge moving means nothing to you. So come back to this idea of if we think of
2621360	2625840	information as differences that make a difference, in terms of first principles,
2625840	2632160	this environment sector that we saw earlier has to be further broken down into pointer and
2632160	2641200	reference states. Again, this is covered in the increases papers. I'm thinking particularly of
2642480	2644320	free energy for generating quantum systems.
2644800	2655600	Again, just to reiterate, this attention controls that compartment, which is by the way very reminiscent
2656800	2662640	to the hierarchy that was earlier with the clock arising higher up in the hierarchy,
2662640	2670480	deeper into the layer. Likewise, whenever you're writing something into a memory,
2670960	2675840	you need to have that clock. Whenever you are deploying noncommittative QRFs, you're going to
2675840	2684800	need an attention control compartment. We just described this operationally. If you didn't have
2684800	2690480	it, then the agent would not be what it is. It could not deploy those noncommittative QRFs.
2690640	2702560	So marching on, we'll just end here with the QRF alignment and the free energy principle.
2702560	2707760	Just a few more words. This is possibly the most interesting picture in this
2709600	2717120	presentation. We can recall here the possibilities for QRF alignment and how
2718080	2729120	free energy comes into play in this formalism. We call A the trivial interaction. We call this
2729120	2736400	a thermal interaction. Then you have a bunch of possibilities. Depending on each possibility,
2736640	2745520	you're going to see things as notes or as in the paper says, non-local in variables.
2747600	2756400	The last situation is what we call alignment when we have QRFs of the same size perfectly aligned.
2757040	2761040	I can't quite recall. I think this
2764480	2774240	would be the situation where you have noiseless classical computation. You have A and B just
2774240	2785360	interacting. This is the situation where, correct me if I'm wrong, Daniel. This is
2787360	2794560	entanglement, asymptotically. Once all the QRFs are aligned, you have entanglement. Now we can tie
2794560	2803280	back maybe to gains earlier. So these two slides conclude the discussion, basically, and then we
2803280	2811440	can open it up. So given these possibilities for how QRFs can be aligned, QRFs deployed by A and B
2811440	2817600	can be aligned, and how in each situation you're going to get noise or whatever,
2820560	2827440	then what does the free energy principle say in this quantum setting? Well,
2830400	2838480	minimizing variational free energy leads you to entanglement. So if theorem here,
2839440	2847600	if you're in the picture of B here, and the QRFs are aligned, A and B are going to be entangled.
2852320	2858960	Now there is a tension between this tendency towards alignment, as the free energy principle
2859920	2869840	will carry you, and observe reality, which is that we're not just a blob of entangled particles.
2869840	2876720	So there is separability, and systems are a tension between maintaining separability,
2878880	2882640	and at the same time being correlated enough to the environment,
2883200	2889920	which has to be able to predict the outcome. And now we can maybe go into a more philosophical
2889920	2897760	discussion on the free energy principle. I should also say, in the last month, just like I talked
2897760	2906640	earlier about QRFs, Lenny Saskin, whose recent paper that talks about QRF, he led me into a
2906640	2914160	rabbit hole of looking into his recent work, and he's talked a lot about complexity. I'm being
2914160	2922240	very speculative here, so if someone can pull me out, that would be good in the comments. But
2923200	2929440	just to skim it through some of his papers, I saw a monograph in 2018 where he talks about complexity,
2930000	2937760	and he puts forward the second law for complexity in quantum systems, an increased complexity,
2937760	2942080	and it is very reminiscent of what's going on here. You have a tension between
2944400	2949920	systems standing to entanglement, and the other side of the free energy functional
2949920	2956960	if you wish, where systems increase in complexity, and that necessarily requires
2959040	2964000	that AMB are separate. So Daniel, do you have any comments at this point?
2966480	2973040	Yeah, there's a lot to it. I like that you showed the four possibilities
2973360	2983280	in the image above and said it was one of the most interesting figures. I agree, and
2986000	2995680	how to connect this to the classical FEP, and also how to see the quantum FEP
2996640	3004560	not as just a second story built on top of the classical FEP, which would be kind of like a
3005360	3013760	historical chronological understanding of the theoretical apparatus, but it's almost like
3013760	3023920	the quantum FEP was like a basement we didn't know about, because it gives a broader context,
3024000	3030400	and though it appeared conceptually several years later in the timeline we understand,
3031840	3042400	that doesn't give it a secondary status. So what it really means for the classical FEP
3043360	3061760	to be kind of like a special case of this actually more generic setting, there's just a lot I'm
3062320	3069280	very uncertain about. I can wrap it up, and then if Dean or you want to say something,
3069520	3074720	we can continue with that, but let me conclude, and this is all I have to say for today,
3077440	3085120	I think I'm sure Chris will explain this more in coming sessions and lectures, but I think the
3085120	3093200	main key difference is in the emergence of space, how it might emerge from something more fundamental,
3093200	3101200	maybe a sense of network or who knows, but that's the big difference, and I suppose the
3101200	3106560	quantum free energy principle generalizes the classical free energy principle, because he
3106560	3116880	doesn't have this spatial embedding. Now this to me personally and also to folks in the audience
3116960	3124480	for asking questions is probably the hardest part to wrap your head around, and I foresee
3125280	3130960	interest in those discussions and lectures that deal with the concept of emergent space,
3132080	3137200	because every time you try to, and I've done this myself, I've been thinking about how you could
3137200	3143920	apply this formalism to better known pictures or compare it for instance with thermal equilibrium,
3143920	3147360	with relaxation with thermal equilibrium, and then you start thinking about okay what is the
3147360	3153520	boundary and so on, it's far from obvious, because again you have to remind yourself that the
3153520	3162160	definition is topological, so in that regard I think it might be worth talking about one of the
3162160	3168240	questions that came up that I thought was good, and then I can call it a day on this end,
3168800	3176000	so this question, and I think it was the first question asked since the last lecture.
3176960	3180880	Can you just read the full question and then read the full answer, thank you.
3180880	3185600	The question on the answer, it's number 28 here, can you guys see it? Should I zoom in a little bit?
3185600	3192480	It's pretty small, but reading it will be good. Okay, so this question I think, I fast myself this
3192480	3199920	question too, maybe in a different way, but basically it gets to the point of what I was
3199920	3208560	saying earlier, that it would be nice to see how we can use this quantum free energy principle
3208560	3214640	formalism to recover maybe familiar settings, such as relaxation to thermal equilibrium,
3214640	3219760	the equation, but that's far from obvious how you do it if your definition is topological.
3222560	3226480	So the question says, what happens when the agent becomes identical to the environment,
3227520	3231600	when the model has been improved so much that it does not differ from the environment, is this
3231600	3237920	a stadium impossible, would it be thermo-amical equilibrium maximum entanglement? Okay, so clearly
3237920	3242160	it's not thermo-amical equilibrium, but I think what the person is asking if I maybe,
3243280	3247600	if I'm understanding this correctly, they're wondering, okay, so if the free energy principle
3248560	3255360	drives AMB towards entanglement, then it's referred to say that they have, that any distinction
3255360	3259360	between them has been solved, right, that they have merged into the same thing.
3262240	3268400	And that has to do with this whole definition of philosophical debate of thing-ness, that Carl
3268400	3274880	Christon, you know, is a proponent of, right, what it means for two things to be separate. Okay,
3275840	3277200	so let's see what Chris said.
3281280	3285040	Christon has pointed out that the limit of the classical FEP, the limit of perfect
3285040	3288400	prediction, corresponds to the general synchrony between system and environment,
3288400	3296160	each sense messages that the other can perfectly predict. Now, however, it's clear,
3297520	3301920	I'm not reading anymore, I'm making a quick remark here, I'll continue in a second.
3302800	3310400	In the classical FEP, it's clear that AMB, even if they are, you know,
3310400	3318000	in the perfect limit of the FEP, they remain different, different entities, right, because
3318000	3327920	you have that, if you wish, that extra layers of differentiation coming from the spatial embedding,
3327920	3333360	right, in the classical FEP, that is clear, that they haven't, even if they are getting
3333360	3338960	synchronized, they have not lost their separate identities, you can always say, well, this is
3338960	3343760	the one that was to the left, and this is the one that was to the right, pun intended in the earlier
3343760	3354400	discussion, right. You have that extra resource for separating them, if you wish, by virtue of the
3354400	3359440	spatial embedding, right, the spatial embedding is giving you this extra information that allows
3359440	3365360	you to keep track of AMB separately. Okay, so I'll continue, this notion depends on the system
3365360	3370320	and its environment being separated and has distinguished somehow, in classical formulations,
3370320	3376000	they are separated in ordinary 3D space, i.e., they occupy different locations, so they are
3376000	3379920	different because they occupy different locations, right, but if you don't have that geometrical
3380880	3386560	background, then how do you know that they're different, right? Okay, so I continue, the quantum
3386560	3391120	formulation is background free, meaning it assumes no spatial embedding, system and environment do
3391120	3395120	not have different locations, even though they have different sets of degrees of freedom in
3395120	3402640	the overall Hilbert space. Here, the FEP, the limit of the FEP is maximum entanglement,
3403520	3406800	this does not mean that the system and its environment are identical, they are, and since
3406800	3412640	they have different degrees of freedom, okay, so this is just addressed as the question I just
3412640	3421280	posed, it means that the joint state is not separable, okay, into a system S and environment T,
3422000	3426320	their states are no longer conditionally independent, this is distinct from thermal
3426320	3430320	equilibrium, which means that they have the same temperature while remaining separable,
3431680	3436000	and that their interaction can be characterized as the change of thermal fluctuations,
3436240	3444800	you know, so I guess this is a nice format for things that are to come, but I do think that this
3446000	3454320	whole idea of emergent space is going to be possibly, you know, one of the most important in
3454320	3462240	the course, and it's going to help stick out between the class and quantum formulations for sure.
3462320	3470560	Dean, what's your take on this? What I saw was that when you have that kind of alignment,
3470560	3479360	that perfect alignment, that is one, that was one, that was D in that diagram, right, that was one
3479360	3486800	state of a complex state that included an A and a B and a C, and probably a whole bunch of other
3486880	3495840	ways that, yeah, right, so that one state where you've got this kind of entanglement
3496720	3502160	isn't into perpetuity, like you don't get there and then stay there, and that's where I think
3503840	3511360	the question of separability and complexity, it still works, because just because you've momentarily
3511360	3517200	gotten to a place that we define here as D, doesn't mean you stay there indefinitely.
3517920	3526400	You could be swapping around to B and C and A in the next instant, so that's, at least that
3526400	3534880	holds the complexity piece up, that moment for however long that moment is, where XA and XB
3534880	3542160	are aligned isn't permanent, so it's not predictable in that sense, therefore it is complex.
3543280	3549600	I still don't know how we get, though, that the closer we get to agreement, the more complex
3549600	3556320	things are, unless we're just talking about D in this array of A, B, C, and D.
3558720	3563040	That goes back to that quantum reference frame. I think, like I said, again,
3563040	3570160	maybe I'm interpreting this wrong, but when I message pass, the reason why I have to, like,
3570160	3575680	literally give it over to the other person and let them have it, I can't give them, have them copy
3575680	3583280	what I'm doing, is because there has to be, I guess that reinforces the separability piece of
3583280	3588800	this as well, the fact that I can't give them a copy that I can only give them the information,
3588800	3595600	and then they've got to sort of unpack it in their own, in their own way of taking it off the
3596720	3607040	boundary. But again, I struggle with this, I'm guilty as charged, but I am, what I'm trying to do
3607040	3614080	is trying to come up with my own narrative so that what Chris is saying makes sense to me,
3614720	3618000	as opposed to make sense to the world, which is what Chris is trying to do.
3620480	3629040	I'll try with another speculative fiction. So there's a screen between, let's just say, the
3629040	3634160	stage in the audience or whatever, it's a holographic screen. And on each side of the screen,
3634160	3643280	there's some embodied object. So that means that it must have, it's a volume-enclosing
3643280	3649600	object, because points and lines and planes are only abstractions, every real physical object
3649600	3658080	encloses volume. And now a light is going to be coming from behind each object facing the screen.
3658080	3664640	And that's this kind of cone that we're seeing from each side, it's like the shadow cast by the
3664640	3672720	object. So if the object was a sphere, then it would be projecting down to a circle onto the screen.
3673280	3679920	If the shape were a cube, it could be projecting down. And so where the light is positioned
3680800	3690640	is the perspective that that cognitive entity is taking on its QRF. Those lights could move. So
3690640	3695040	now we have this situation where the two spotlights are moving, maybe the shapes are staying the same,
3695040	3701040	maybe they're changing too. And it's like two searchlights scanning across this
3702320	3710960	B oval. And sometimes they are perfectly locked. I mean, there could be a situation where they're
3710960	3720560	perfectly aligned. Or there could be situations where they're totally disjoint. And each of those
3720560	3732720	situations have different implications for what one entity sees when it looks at the screen.
3733440	3739840	Maybe like the shadow is the only part where you can see, because the rest of it is too blinding
3739840	3749040	or something like that. And so then if we're in case A here, where maybe B doesn't have a projection
3749040	3756160	or maybe B's projections totally somewhere else, then A is in this solipsistic, I'm the active
3756160	3768480	agent interacting within an inert world setting. And D is like potentially the computer engineer's
3768480	3776320	classical dream or asymptote, which is like all the data going through the USB cable is just
3777120	3785760	being perfectly noiselessly received. And then we also get these B and C cases.
3787040	3795840	But A is kind of like the inert world. D is like the perfect communication channel and then to
3795840	3800640	connect it just to Friston's concept of generalized synchrony. As we've talked about many times,
3800640	3806800	generalized synchrony doesn't mean lockstep. Two agents could reduce their uncertainty about
3806800	3812560	each other, not by doing the same thing at every time step, but for example, by turn taking.
3812560	3818800	And I think that points the way to how we get reduction of variational free energy, reduction
3818800	3826400	of prediction error, surprise and so on, without especially spatial temporal enmeshment, but not
3826400	3832800	necessarily even informational identity enmeshment, because you could have two things that through
3832800	3840560	their alignment become actually differentiated. And that could increase the mutual information
3840560	3845600	between two metronomes, not just to have them going in the same direction, but to have them
3845600	3851280	going in opposite directions, the mutual information those two settings is going to be high.
3852240	3858480	So it's not the case that generalized synchrony means that things are becoming
3862640	3871040	blurred. We could actually also have integrated information through increased
3871520	3880960	articulation, not just decreased. And then life finds a way or cognition finds a way
3882160	3893120	on this trade off frontier of in our pursuit of unitarity, will we blur to unify or will we
3893120	3901200	differentiate to unify? But those are the paths we have, we don't have the backwards ratchet.
3903840	3905840	Yeah, yeah, makes sense.
3913760	3922320	Any other ladder slides, Ender? No, that's it. So Chris made a few more remarks at the end of
3923520	3932000	language here. But he mentioned that he's going to talk more about this in the coming lecture,
3932000	3933840	so we'll just leave it up to him.
3938640	3948320	Yeah, there could be some very powerful and interesting linguistic opportunities
3948960	3964560	for updating our speaking to reflect what we are learning here. I don't know what those necessarily
3964560	3973360	are. Whether it's a syntactic or semantic thing or whether it's a narrative thing,
3973520	3984720	but how to actually re enter some of these formalisms into our focus understanding
3986320	3995520	could just be immensely powerful. And we could have a lot of integrity between the natural
3995520	4004240	language way that potentially we're already showing up for engagement and some of these
4004240	4012480	formalisms that get to first principles about interacting entities and boundary conditions
4012480	4021200	and all of that. Dean, any penultimate thoughts? Not really. I'm going to go back and listen to
4021200	4027120	the I'm going to listen to Chris's comments again about this common cause and the fine
4027120	4033120	tuning assumption and whether that's sort of a metaphorically a dialing in or what it what he
4033120	4038560	what he means exactly by the fine tuning in the in the context of this conversation today.
4039200	4044160	What you just kind of said about are we dulling something here or are we sculpting something
4044160	4052320	to make it more fitable? Like, I'm going to go on now and go back and listen to what he
4052320	4056640	talks about in terms of fine tuning and maybe update my priors around that. So
4060720	4066480	And are any last thoughts or maybe scroll over to the schedule of the course again just so we
4066480	4076000	can close on that. Yeah, we're halfway through. We just completed the third discussion section now.
4076640	4082400	So we've had three lectures and three discussions. It's all downhill from here.
4083680	4087680	By the way, this was the first midterm. You guys both did well.
4087920	4096320	Um, we're going to head into four, or like session four, with these last three, how agents use
4096320	4099920	multiple communication channels and that's going to get connected to the quantum FEP.
4100720	4105680	How space time emerges from communication, which is something that we've brought up a
4105680	4110000	bunch. It's been in the background, but but making that explicit is going to be exciting.
4110000	4118560	And then section six, I think is just going to be such a jumping off point because the scope
4119600	4127360	and the intensity of what is transpiring is extreme. So connecting it to biology,
4128320	4134960	which is to say life more fully and where we go in, in 23 and beyond,
4135920	4138720	that's going to be awesome. So any last words, Andrew?
4140720	4142400	Uh, no, I was just going to go with what you said.
4144000	4149120	Very, I would, I would say it's going to be uphill in, in terms of how interesting it's going to get.
4151280	4153600	Up hill in the good sense, meaning that we're planning.
4154960	4162080	Cool. Well, I encourage people to check out the course website and submit questions that they'd
4162240	4167600	like to see addressed by Chris also to register and join these participatory discussions. There'll
4167600	4176240	be three more of them. So if you want to join, share your QRF, be part of the publication of
4176240	4183040	all of these works that we'll compile at the end and just get your exoskeleton in the game
4183920	4191040	with what is happening here. It'd be really awesome to hear more voices and to have more on board.
4192080	4196240	Okay. Thank you, Dean and Andrew. Till next time.
4222080	4224240	Thank you.
