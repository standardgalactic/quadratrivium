0	6320	All right, thanks Daniel for having me, everyone at the Active Inference Lab, sorry for cancelling
6320	7320	twice.
7320	14240	Life's been kind of crazy with finishing this book that this talk will be about and having
14240	20760	a kid I'm six months old and I got sick like a week ago, like right, leading up to like,
20760	23240	you know, didn't want to cancel a third time and look crazy.
23240	29760	So this is a very rushed presentation, it'll be better if it's more like a conversation
29760	34400	since I haven't even gone through the slides myself once.
34400	38840	And it's going to get into a lot of things like immediately like open up bags of worms,
38840	46680	like there's just philosophical issues, things that people won't agree about like immediately.
46680	53680	But yeah, so this is just going to be like a small introduction to the thesis in the
53680	54680	book.
54680	59760	And yeah, I'll explain more, I guess, after I begin.
59760	67480	So yeah, it's called this the integrated evolutionary synthesis compared to like the modern synthesis
67480	70240	or even the extended evolutionary synthesis.
70240	80520	This is integrated because it kind of reconceptualizes evolution, biology and evolution in terms
80520	85080	of thermodynamics and information theory or energy flows.
85080	89880	Energy and information flows takes from cybernetics.
89880	96120	So yeah, it's a non reductive theory of everything that includes emergent phenomena like life,
96120	98640	mind and civilization.
98640	102720	I say that because most theories of everything we're used to are fundamental physics theories
102720	106520	that don't have anything to say about life and consciousness.
106520	109480	They ignore them.
109480	114280	And I don't think those should be called theories of everything because theories of everything
114280	117680	should be an explanation for everything.
117680	123120	And if you leave the things that we care about most out, then it's not much of a theory of
123120	124120	everything.
124120	131040	So this is the book I've spent the last two to three years writing obsessively.
131040	133820	And it's available for pre-order now.
133820	139380	So if you want to check that out, you can find it with a Google search.
139380	142100	Here's the table of contents.
142100	145060	So the book is broken into three sections.
145060	151180	Part one talks about the origins of life and part two about evolution while part three
151180	158220	focuses on consciousness and free will and the fate of life in the universe.
158220	167700	So these really big questions that we're going to focus on part two and give a pretty superficial
167700	170580	overview of part two.
170580	177820	But you can feel free to ask me any questions about any of the other topics that are related.
177820	184620	And I'll try to see what I can answer without going into all of the information that I would
184620	186820	need to explain those things.
186820	194020	So Thomas Huxley, known as Darwin's bulldog, because he was such a strong advocate for
194020	198460	Darwin's theory, said that the question of questions for mankind, the problem which underlies
198460	202860	all others, is more deeply interesting than any other, is the ascertainment and of the
202860	209180	place which man occupies in nature and of his relations to the universe of things.
209180	213420	So where do we fit into the grand cosmic scheme?
213420	222220	So scientists in the 20th century and I would even say now believe that we are an accident.
222220	232740	So Jacques Manot, a French biochemist who won the Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine,
232740	236420	wrote a book called Chance and the Sesty, which was really influential.
236420	241540	And he was just as reductionist as you can get, man at last knows that he is alone in
241540	248260	the unfeeling immensity of the universe out of which he emerged only by chance, neither.
248260	252540	So some of the words are covered by Daniel.
252540	257660	So neither is his destiny spelled out nor his duty have been written down.
257660	259980	I think there's something wrong with that quote.
259980	263540	But so if there are times where I'm trying to read something where the picture's over,
263540	265540	I might have to skip.
265540	269460	You can move that because it looks different on my side.
269460	270460	It looks fine.
270460	271460	Perfect.
272380	273380	Yeah.
273380	276100	Neither his destiny nor his duty have been written down.
276100	283260	So that was kind of based on this old idea that the emergence of life was a product
283260	285140	of chance assembly.
285140	292220	So like this just statistical fluctuation that brought together all the molecules needed
292220	294380	to create the first cell.
294380	297380	We now know that that's probably not what happened.
297380	300180	It's this gradual process of self-organization.
300180	307100	Jeremy England has been in the media a lot about his theory of dissipative adaptation.
307100	315380	So let's see.
315380	319220	So we will see this is kind of like a different point of view.
319220	322940	Not everybody was convinced by Amano.
322940	326860	Carl Sagan said the origin of life must be a highly probable affair as soon as conditions
326860	329820	permit, up it pops.
329820	337420	So this is an important question, whether life was improbable or inevitable.
337420	342380	So if life is highly improbable, we're likely to be alone in the universe, but if the emergence
342380	348100	of life is inevitable, given a certain set of common physical conditions, then it's
348100	355100	likely that we have life at least on planets that are sufficiently Earth-like, specifically
355100	363780	have geochemistry like the Earths have a star, some like the Earths, because that's
363780	367540	what provides the energy that pushes it far from equilibrium.
367540	372620	So we're going to get into all that stuff pretty soon.
372620	378940	Christian Dedeau, this quote is kind of a response to Stephen Jay Gould, who just really
378940	387940	emphasized, to both Amano and Stephen Jay Gould, the importance of chance in nature
387940	395940	and that everything is basically a contingency that came from a chance process, where Dedeau
395940	403260	says that you can have this inevitability that some philosophers would see as teleology,
403260	411140	but it doesn't mean that this inevitable progress is being driven by a supernatural force.
411140	415820	He explains that the natural constraints within which chance operates are such that evolution
415820	420460	in the direction of increasing complexity was virtually bound to take place if given
420460	425180	the opportunity, chance does not exclude inevitability.
425180	433060	So he was also a Nobel Prize winning biologist, the same category as Amano, but had the complete
433060	435580	opposite opinion.
435580	442580	And we can talk about that too, basically, when systems are open systems and they're
442580	451020	pushed far from equilibrium by a flow of energy, you basically get something like a statistical
451020	458020	bias away from what we would expect with isolated systems, closed systems that aren't open to
458020	464540	energy will relax the thermodynamic equilibrium, and when a system is being pushed far from
464540	473420	equilibrium, it will naturally organize because organization happens under the flow of energy
473420	477340	and we're going to see exactly why it's a Darwinian process.
477340	485700	But basically, you get inevitability if you have the right ingredients.
485700	494260	So we'll talk about, to kind of frame this, we already kind of mentioned those two worldviews.
494260	500700	So the first worldview would be the reductionist worldview, and I should be clear that productionism
500700	509300	is also, it's a method and an ideology and we shouldn't confuse those two things.
509300	514260	And Daniel, I guess just so I'm, you know, know where I'm at maybe when you, when I've
514340	516780	gone 30 minutes, you can let me know.
516780	518780	Okay, I'll hoot.
518780	520780	Okay, great.
520780	527060	So reductionism, the method basically says that reality can be understood by breaking
527060	532940	down all physical phenomena into their simplest parts so that we may observe the basic behavior
532940	536100	of the fundamental constituents of nature.
536100	545860	So I'm just going to plug in this charger, I might need to do that in a bit, but basically
545860	548380	the method is how science works.
548380	553100	If we want to understand emergence, we also have to understand how the components that
553100	555780	systems are made of work in isolation.
555780	562340	So it's an essential part of the story, but it's not the whole part we'll see.
562340	571260	So the method inspired an ideology and ideology is just that, it's an ideology and it's rigid
571260	581460	and basically the method doesn't really imply that the ideology is true.
581460	588180	So when I'm attacking reductionism, I'm not attacking the method, I'm attacking the worldview.
588180	596780	And so that worldview, we can say that basically, so hard to determine is part of the reductionist
596780	597900	worldview.
597900	604220	So thought experiment that some people are familiar with, I'm sure Laplace's demon, but
604220	614020	basically Laplace was a French mathematician that took Newton's kind of model of reality
614020	616300	and applied it to everything.
616300	619580	Newton himself was kind of a mystic when it comes to life, he didn't really think that
619580	623620	physics apply to organisms or at least to humans.
623620	634020	But Laplace really came up with the idea that basically the evolution of the universe is
634020	642700	just this clockwork universe where it's like a machine with cogs that are just turning.
642700	648140	So there's no room for agency and free will in that picture.
648140	657060	When Boltzmann came along in the 19th century and came up with statistical mechanics, the
657060	662540	clockwork universe kind of became the billiard ball universe, but it's just the idea that
662540	671140	everything in the universe is made of atoms and that these atoms are interacting and that's
671140	672140	the whole picture.
672580	677500	So the ideology says we're nothing more than our atoms, so we don't make decisions, consciousness
677500	683580	is just an epiphenomenon and it feels to us like we are, but actually this trajectory
683580	690540	was determined basically, not basically from the moment of the Big Bang and there's kind
690540	698060	of no freedom in anything and no future other than what was determined from the beginning.
698060	702420	So the second law of thermodynamics also sort of shaped the reductionists were abused
702420	706460	as the universe is becoming increasingly disordered.
706460	710540	There's actually kind of two different interpretations of the second law.
710540	718380	The first one kind of emerged from the work of Carnot and Clausius, the kind of original
718380	726460	thermodynamics work where entropy was about a measure of energy that can't be used for
726460	727460	work.
727460	736380	It's a measure of like useless energy where later with Boltzmann he tried to put the second
736380	741460	law on like a statistical basis based on like atomic theory.
741460	751100	So basically people applied Boltzmann's statistical interpretation of the second law to the universe
751100	755940	and came up with this notion that the universe is becoming increasingly disordered, which
755940	762100	isn't great for life because it means that life is transient and likely cosmically insignificant
762100	769500	and this worldview is associated with materialism which doesn't recognize consciousness as real,
769500	777020	certainly doesn't recognize it as having causal power and historically it often ignored apparently
777020	782620	in material phenomena like energy and information and mental processes.
782620	790980	I am just going to grab my charger so sounds good.
790980	794700	This doesn't die but I will be right back.
794700	798220	Take your time.
798220	803780	So those who are watching live please feel free to leave a comment or a question.
803780	806340	I'm writing some things down.
806340	820580	We'll look forward to the return of electrical power to Bobby.
820580	826300	All right my first live stream I will be more prepared my return to part two that's something
826300	832700	else I told Daniel is that this is kind of like part one and I come back and talk about
832700	834620	the ideas that come after.
834620	840700	So it will have 15.2 it will be awesome it's an infinite sequence it's the sequence is
840700	851860	always yours great okay so reductionist worldview says that all life forms including humans
851860	856940	are nothing more than collections of atoms obligatorily following fixed and arbitrary
856940	862260	mechanical trajectories determined solely by math and not by mine.
862260	871540	So this worldview if you convince someone that they don't have free will because you
871540	877260	tell them about the reductionist worldview there was actually a study where they did
877260	884860	this and they read participants passage from Francis Crick explaining that it appears that
884860	893940	we don't have any free will the participants actually on subsequent tests were more likely
893940	898780	to cheat on the test because they felt like they didn't have any personal responsibility
898780	904220	they weren't making the decisions therefore they could cheat that's kind of funny because
904220	909780	they are actually you can see that like by what they're like being told that they are
909780	916700	changing their behavior so it is having some kind of effect if we do in fact have agency
916700	922300	or free will and we're kind of talking about agency we don't really get into free will
922300	929800	but those are related topics but if that's not true then that's really bad that the majority
929800	933180	of scientists are telling people we don't have free will because the people that believe
933180	939340	this it's having negative effects on for example mental health other studies have shown that
939940	946380	believe in no free will can lead to depression and believe in free will can have all these positive
946380	952500	effects. Of course as soon as I start talking about free will I'm sure a lot of people have
952500	958140	objections might think that there's no way that we can have room for free will in a physical
958140	964260	worldview but that's exactly what we're going to begin to talk about today the causal power of
964300	971820	information and that basically organisms are agents that are cybernetic control units so
971820	984180	as controllers we do have agency so and the belief that we're accidents of nature rather
984180	992620	than natural manifestations of physical laws I'm sure also impacts our sense of well-being just
992620	1000340	so you know I'm not making this up I can I'll give you some quotes from really famous physicists
1000340	1006460	who are kind of militant reductionists so Brian Green says I think it's very important to face
1006460	1011740	up to the truth of reality which is in fact that life and consciousness is a fleeting phenomenon
1011740	1018580	on the entire cosmological timeline. Brian Green just came out with a book and he's like
1018860	1024700	going on interviews just saying this and it's really interesting because some other famous
1024700	1029260	physicists don't agree at all and he's stating it like it's a complete fact so for example David
1029260	1035380	Deutsch would not agree with this and we'll get into that Sabine Hauston Felder is another person
1035380	1044500	I know some of the some of my friends in the community who are these people you know working on
1044820	1050660	emergence and causation stuff get bothered by her statements because she is also very
1052100	1057060	ultra-reductionistic so I wish people would stop insisting they have free will it's terribly
1057060	1061460	annoying insisting that free will exist is bad science like insisting that horoscopes tell
1061460	1067620	you something about the future it's not compatible with our knowledge about nature so I'm saying
1067620	1073380	that's wrong we won't get into free will that much but if you have questions at the end we will
1074100	1081380	talk about how information adaptive information gets built up by evolution in
1082180	1088580	adaptive systems complex adaptive systems and you will see how these systems actually do control
1088580	1095060	their own future so Sam Harris is another anti-free will person says you're not controlling
1095060	1099940	the storm and you are not lost in it you are the storm so it's kind of funny because he's using a
1099940	1108580	metaphor here but what this story kind of reveals is that yes we are a storm that's right we are a
1108580	1116420	dissipative structure like a storm emerges to dissipate an energy gradient and we're not really
1116420	1121060	going to talk about that that's what the first part of the book is about the origins part but
1122100	1126900	I'm just pointing it out because it's interesting because we are like a storm in that aspect
1127460	1134660	but we also differ from a storm because a storm does not have agency a storm does not have the
1134660	1139780	ability to seek out new energy gradients it's just kind of
1142340	1149460	being pushed around by these gradients in nature where organisms are actually
1150340	1156340	controllers and so you are a storm but you do have control over this storm
1158180	1167060	so these people are kind of have the opposite view so Julio Tinoni creator of integrated
1167060	1172180	information theory says there is true free will a great lecture that just popped up I think
1172180	1179140	months ago where he gives a two-hour talk on basically integrate information and how it shows
1179220	1188100	that systems do you have causal power and in a way have free will so depending on your definition
1188100	1194500	of free will we do that free will according to his model David Doge said in an interview with
1194500	1200980	John Horgan just a year ago or so I'm sure we have free will Christoph Koch says explains how
1200980	1206020	you know there are a lot of experiments the LeBet experiments which we will talk about next time
1206820	1213860	that basically some people interpret it as not having free will but actually
1215060	1223380	we will see later when you deliberate that's actually an act of free will these choices
1223380	1227460	where we're actually where you bring your entire conscious being to that question and try to
1227460	1233700	analyze it under all the various conditions and actually there was a study Koch did that kind of
1234420	1245380	showed that the LeBet study was kind of interpreted wrong and for anyone who understands that stuff
1245380	1251060	the readiness potential that was supposed to be proof that there was no free will disappeared when
1251060	1260020	the decisions involved deliberation so yeah that's kind of meandering but I'm sure a lot of people
1260020	1267300	are interested in this bigger picture of why this emergence paradigm is so radically different from
1267300	1275620	the reductionist paradigm it kind of puts information front and center and systems that process
1275620	1284900	information complex adaptive systems are computational systems and the systems in the with
1284900	1289140	these systems information actually does have causal power we're going to explain what we mean by that
1289940	1297060	so paradigm of emergence the collective says the collective behavior of interacting parts not
1297060	1301380	simply how they function in isolation is key to understanding the emergence and evolution
1301380	1307140	of all the fascinating organisms and ecosystems that make up the biosphere so it's really not about
1308020	1315620	just like particles it's about the patterns that emerge when these systems find these certain
1315700	1322180	configurations through basically Darwinian mechanisms and we'll see that self-organization
1322180	1328420	too has a Darwinian dynamic each emergence in the cosmic self-organization process is brought
1328420	1332740	about by higher order phase transition that moves life ever further away from a state of
1332740	1339460	thermodynamic equilibrium and total disorder I'm assuming the audience knows that what
1339460	1346900	thermodynamic equilibrium is it's basically if you have for example Boltzmann took a model of
1348580	1355300	an ideal gas and explained that for example if the gas molecules are bunched up in the corner
1355300	1364420	naturally it's going the gas is going to spread out until there's no pattern and basically it's
1364420	1373380	like a completely mixed up state so equilibrium is associated with death and disorder because
1374420	1384500	systems naturally tend toward this more mixed up un-patterned completely chaotic state
1386020	1393300	of course later we're going to talk about why open systems that that rule doesn't apply basically
1393300	1397860	systems that are open to the flow of energy can resist this tendency towards a disorder
1397860	1405540	and that's really what the whole story is kind of based on um so through a nested series of such
1405540	1411460	phase transitions these are also called these higher order phase transitions are major evolutionary
1411460	1417540	transitions John Maynard Smith talked about them and metasystem transitions by the cyber-neticist
1417540	1423460	Valentin Turchin basically the same concept with some subtle differences so the idea is that
1423460	1429140	cosmic self-organization is a series of these transitions where functional things come together
1429140	1434260	to make larger functional ones which come together to even to make even larger ones and so on and
1434260	1440180	through this process adaptive complexity or life so that's a more general way to talk about life
1441060	1446740	becomes better equipped to dominate the cosmos life requires an organization that is increasingly
1446740	1451220	hierarchical and integrated and therefore more resilient and computationally powerful
1453140	1460820	so here are just a couple of figures um you see this hierarchy uh in this structural hierarchy
1460820	1466820	of matter in life this was adapted from a big physics journal I can't remember which one it was
1466820	1475940	but um basically you know physicists are recognizing this hierarchy even when it extends to life so
1475940	1485140	Jeffrey West's book scale comes to mind uh and so we see the hierarchy of science kind of naturally
1485140	1492340	mirror this hierarchy of matter and life and um the reductionist picture would say that these
1492340	1501300	things at the top here um are kind of insignificant parts of the story transient um but we will see
1501300	1509700	that this you know the more we go up the more influence uh on cosmic evolution the phenomena have
1511300	1522500	so uh Thomas Huxley's question about man's place in the cosmos uh is um basically the emergence
1522500	1527860	of paradigm uh the paradigm of emergence I'm going to discuss and actually this is kind of
1527860	1533700	maybe like in a specific or a new paradigm of emergence because it includes all this stuff about
1533700	1538980	thermodynamics and information theory um sense that emergence the emergence and evolution of
1538980	1544340	life minds societies and technology are all part of one thermodynamic process one evolutionary
1544340	1552020	process one computational process unified by the concept of knowledge so uh this theory is a theory
1552020	1559220	of knowledge creation um and so knowledge is going to be the unifying theme and we'll briefly
1559220	1564740	talk about epistemology I wanted to talk about it more but it just would have been too long um cosmic
1564740	1571220	evolution uh in this paradigm is a universal process of becoming as opposed to being so the
1571220	1577700	universe isn't this static thing uh it's actually evolving very much like an organism or a complex
1577780	1584180	adaptive system um so it's not a panpsychic theory in this theory consciousness emerges that's very
1584180	1592100	important um but you might call it emergent panpsychism uh because uh as this evolutionary
1592100	1598740	process proceeds uh an animate matter as life spreads gets converted into animate matter
1599780	1604580	so in this picture humans are neither a cosmic accident nor the end goal of evolution
1605460	1611780	so we are instead a step on the evolutionary ladder of becoming and we are also potentially an
1611780	1617620	essential driver of increasing cosmic complexity so this big idea is that the universe is undergoing
1617620	1623700	this majestic self-organizing process and at this moment of time at least in this corner of the
1623700	1632100	universe we are the stars of the show um this picture is from Eric Chasen's uh both the rise of
1632180	1638340	complexity uh cosmic evolution the rise of complexity uh he's a harvard astrophysicist
1638340	1643540	um but i just used uh freeman daison code here because it seemed irrelevant it's conceivable
1643540	1647860	that life may have a larger role to play than we have yet imagined life may succeed against
1647860	1653620	all odds in molding the universe to its own purpose so i guess brian green doesn't buy that at all
1653620	1662100	but um if that's true then uh as as cosmology cosmologists have to think about the the role
1662100	1667620	of life there's a lot of people who have said similar things like septaloid and famously
1667620	1675620	raker as well um so just a couple quotes here so you know you know when when people hear these
1675620	1680420	terms progress there's just the stigma immediately they thought like oh someone's trying to sneak in
1680420	1687940	religion or some intelligent design theory um so you see these trusted names of physics here david
1687940	1692740	oich has narrowly conceived evolutionary theory considers as mere vehicles for the replication
1692740	1697620	of our genes or memes and it refuses to address the question of why evolution has tended to create
1697620	1703620	ever greater adaptive complexity or the role that such complexity plays in the wider scheme of things
1703620	1709460	so there is clearly implying that adaptive complexity does have this larger role to play
1709780	1715700	um we now see how it is possible for the universe to increase both organization and entropy at the
1715700	1720660	same time the optimistic and pessimistic eras of time can coexist the universe can display
1720660	1726020	creative unidirectional unidirectional progress even in the face of the second law because as
1726020	1734580	paul davies says that um so that's really uh kind of a key point uh in this is that um
1735540	1741860	the second law actually is in a sense driving this increase in progress so not only can we have
1741860	1747060	unidirectional progress in the face of the second law uh it seems that this progress requires the
1747060	1753140	second law uh because we'll see that the second law is the basically the natural selection pressure
1753140	1759940	for uh self-organizing systems so in a sense the second law is both uh shiva the destroyer and
1760020	1769140	Brahma the creator um so a goal of this unifying theory of reality uh i've been calling the great
1769140	1778180	conciliance it was actually a name uh suggested by marco lin who is uh is a firstonian and
1778180	1785780	influenced some of this talk um so basically the unifying theory of reality illuminates the
1785860	1791060	connection between complexity cognition consciousness and cosmic evolution or matter
1791060	1796180	of mind and cosmos um and it's really based on complexity science it's a lot broader than
1796180	1802660	complexity science but i guess that name kind of you know includes everything so it's a unification
1802660	1807380	of major sciences of our time including but not limited to physics biology neuroscience computer
1807380	1812260	science evolutionary theory and statistics and basically it describes complex adaptive systems
1812260	1818660	of all scales in terms of energy and information flows so it uses statistical thermodynamics
1818660	1825780	information theory and cybernetics um so we will talk about those a bit uh coming up so if you
1825780	1833460	want to see kind of like a map of what sort of informs uh this non-reductive theory of everything
1833780	1842260	here you go so i know there's a lot of information so i'll kind of try to simplify this for everyone
1842980	1847780	um there are some unifying paradigms that have emerged so basically this theory is nothing new
1847780	1856180	it's basically evolutionary epistemology um after that came universal Darwinism and later uh right
1856180	1861860	now we're seeing this kind of revolution with like Bayesian inference and these ideas being applied
1861860	1875940	to everything um so uh being informed uh by these um paradigms and uh combining those paradigms are
1875940	1881380	updating them i should say with uh information from non-equilibrium thermodynamics so we're
1881380	1887780	talking about the thermodynamics of open systems uh information theory so Shannon's theory uh
1888740	1894260	some of you will know that information theory is related very closely to non-equilibrium
1894260	1903460	thermodynamics and basically uh Boltzmann's statistical entropy is mathematically the same as uh
1903460	1911140	Shannon entropy or information entropy which is a measure of uncertainty um if i had more time i would
1911140	1918020	go through thermodynamics and the different types of entropy but uh we don't have time for that but
1918020	1924340	if anyone has any questions i can clarify um cybernetics was basically information theory
1925060	1931940	applied to biology adaptive systems it was the first science of adaptive systems really and uh
1931940	1937540	it's funny while writing this uh i found out because you know i hadn't i had heard the name
1937540	1945460	cybernetics but it wasn't clear how important it was um in a talk by uh Jim Crutchfeld uh
1945460	1952020	Santa Fe Institute basically revealed that uh because cybernetics got associated with like the
1952020	1958020	Russian uh like during the Cold War kind of like the Russian agenda um cybernetics was used
1958020	1965380	to design like heat seeking missiles uh Norbert Wiener's theory was almost immediately applied
1965380	1974340	for military uses and because of that it stopped being taught in American uh colleges um so uh yeah
1974340	1979540	it's really important and it was actually uh emerging at the same time as information theory
1979540	1985940	people were already uh thinking about systems in terms of information flows but it's more than
1985940	1992900	information theory because it's a science of feedback um so dynamical systems theory or
1992900	1998580	complex adaptive systems is kind of like an offshoot of that um all of these inform what
1998580	2004660	i've called universal Bayesianism not the only person to call it that um i had searched that
2004660	2011140	term and found Adam Saffron's uh paper on integrated world modeling theory that used that same term
2011780	2019140	but uh John Campbell has been a researcher um who has uh done a lot to show this equivalence between
2019860	2027060	uh evolutionary processes and processes of Bayesian inference we're gonna talk about that in a little
2027060	2034340	bit um so yeah if anybody has any questions about that but really all of these things origin of life
2034340	2040900	research integrate evolutionary theory um if you haven't checked out the work of these people like
2040900	2047460	everybody here's worth reading their work but uh so from that we get the unifying theory of reality
2047460	2052580	that is based on what i call the evolutionary epistemology universal Darwinism universal
2052580	2057860	Bayesianism framework that's a long name i'm aware of that but it's just to show that these
2057860	2068580	three theories are basically the same theory um so universal Darwinism says that the universe is
2068580	2073780	evolving at every scale through both competitive evolution and through self-organization which
2073780	2079140	is cooperative evolution among agents that have formed a collective unit so it started with Richard
2079140	2086340	Dawkins and his concepts of the meme and the selfish gene that uh memes uh were these uh cultural
2086340	2094980	units that were equivalent to genes and so we started to see how information was this paradigm
2094980	2100580	that could be extended beyond biology and then we had Dan Dennett and Darwin's dangerous idea
2100580	2107380	really extend this to like everything to self-organizing systems to like cultural and
2107380	2114020	technological systems uh evolutionary epistemology came before that it was based on Karl Popper's
2114020	2119460	philosophy but it was actually invented by cognitive psychologist Donald Campbell and
2119460	2126500	basically that said that the evolutionary process is a problem solving procedure that creates knowledge
2126500	2137220	so uh the information stored in genomes and in uh brains and cultural memory uh basically
2138020	2143540	that all that knowledge accumulates from an evolutionary process and it's really helpful
2143540	2149620	to think of it as knowledge especially when we start to talk about this in in uh the context of
2149620	2159060	thermodynamics and information because uh basically this knowledge is what allows life adaptive systems
2159060	2166900	to stay far from equilibrium they can resist this tendency towards decay life can continue to persist
2166900	2174500	if it can acquire the knowledge that it needs to essentially to find free energy that will allow
2174580	2181940	it to sustain itself um so we'll talk about that in a second more um so universal Bayesianism
2181940	2187060	is a Bayesian update of the first two paradigms knowledge is encoded uh so the knowledge that
2187060	2193380	evolutionary epistemology can describe it's actually encoded in biological systems uh
2193380	2199380	in the form of a world model so this model is an internal representation and statistical mapping
2199380	2204260	of the environment which gets updated through adaptation and adaptive learning and talk about
2204260	2214100	that process um really the the whole Bayesian brain hypothesis and free energy principle
2214100	2220020	is inspired by cybernetics heavily so Ross Ashby's good regulator theorem and law of
2220020	2226020	requisite variety which we'll talk about was kind of the first talk of systems having models and
2226020	2231380	having to model the environment um so Crawfordston says inference is actually quite close to a
2231380	2236260	theory of everything including evolution consciousness and life itself uh we're not
2236260	2243540	going to go into those bigger implications that would be at the uh end of the book in the last
2243540	2250660	chapter but basically this isn't just a theory about evolution um well it is evolution but
2250660	2258100	evolution applied way more broadly so quantum mechanics has uh an interpretation that's consistent
2258100	2264420	with this and bigger problems like the fine-tuning of the constants and parameters that allow for
2264420	2270420	the emergence of life in the universe we can actually uh probably have the best explanation
2270420	2275780	for the fine-tuning problem and the measurement problem of quantum mechanics uh with this theory
2275780	2282260	um we won't talk about it but just so you know next time uh cosmological natural selection by
2282260	2286980	Lee Smolin is the theory that kind of addresses the fine-tuning problem from a universal Darwinism
2286980	2294500	perspective while quantum Darwinism uh addresses the measurement problem um so we will save that
2294500	2300420	from next time but feel free to ask questions about any of those so what does this do I have this
2300420	2307300	name poetic metanaturalism I meant to take that out but uh next time we'll get into why I chose
2307300	2314580	that name it's actually um it sounds kind of like you know like complex or buzzword or jargony but
2314580	2322020	there's actually very practical reasons for having that name um so this uh unifying theory
2322020	2328020	bridges matter with mine so universal Darwinism gives us a picture of the open-ended complexity
2328020	2335220	growth uh that this whole idea is based on the idea that evolution keeps producing uh
2335220	2345620	increasingly complex intelligent forms of life excuse me um so uh yeah universal Bayesianism is
2346340	2353060	the link that kind of connects those paradigms with uh consciousness so again we won't get into
2353060	2360260	that today but when uh you understand that knowledge is stored stored in the form of a world model
2360260	2366180	that a system that models itself can experience then we start to get a better understanding of
2366180	2372100	like what consciousness is consciousness is it's a it's a mental model so it's not a traditional
2372100	2377140	panpsychic theory even though I know first in and Levin and some of his colleagues have kind of
2377140	2384340	been flirting with panpsychism this theory would say that's wrong and it's kind of uh reduces
2384420	2391300	consciousness to something trivial um by saying that it's in everything like um a proton is conscious
2391300	2396820	because it's a triad of quarks that have to be in a certain configuration so there is some minimal
2396820	2403860	level of integrated information um that's not enough uh to get a conscious experience again
2403860	2409860	observer um so saffron's integrated world modern theory says that you need a model with spatial,
2409860	2415060	temporal and causal coherence I would also argue that it requires self-modeling capacity
2416260	2420660	talk about that a little bit at the end if anyone's interested um but this theory is supposed to
2420660	2428980	bridge mine with cosmic evolution so the story starts with the second law um Daniel if there's
2428980	2435460	any questions about that like intro let me know yeah if not I can just proceed could I ask two
2435460	2442260	questions from the chat sure okay the first question is from blue blue wrote do you think
2442260	2447700	that non-living autonomous agents with multiple competing priorities such as self-driving cars
2448260	2453540	have free will if not what is the defining difference between these systems and humans
2454740	2460980	uh no I don't think they have free will so um adaptive information is a special type of information
2460980	2468100	I do think those things and this is kind of following Sarah Walker's lead who's at Arizona
2468100	2475540	State I think she's also SFI faculty now but basically um to have self-driving cars you first
2475540	2481780	need life so anything like a self-driving car that's like this information processing system
2482500	2490580	if you were to come across a broken down self-driving car on some planet and you saw that
2490580	2495540	you would have to infer that there was also life there because life is part of the trajectory to
2495540	2502820	get to that but I wouldn't say that it has free will because it's just this input output machine
2503940	2512340	with a defined set of algorithms and uh adaptive systems are more flexible uh and
2513300	2520740	they're okay so in the next next time we'll talk about actually the emergence of agency
2521460	2530340	which occurs with the origin of life or a biogenesis and you basically um because this self-organized
2530340	2537540	system that would be kind of like the proto-cell um is evolving through a mechanism that Darwinian
2537540	2543780	dynamic for self-organization that will explain in a bit it builds up information and at some point
2543780	2549540	there's a phase transition where the information that's getting built up in the system uh basically
2550580	2557620	gains what Sarah Walker and Paul Davies call informational control so there's a point where
2557620	2567140	information actually starts calling the shots and you can see the difference between uh systems
2567140	2574180	that where there is informational control so living systems and inanimate systems because for
2574180	2581540	example um inanimate systems uh their movement can be predicted with Newton's laws so anyone who's
2581540	2588420	taken first year physics probably had to do an exercise where you're trying to predict the movement
2588420	2596420	of some macroscopic system like a ball that gets kicked or pushed by a gust of wind and what you do
2596420	2602900	is you um you have to draw out all the forces acting on the system and then you can understand
2602900	2609300	where the system's going to go with life you don't need an external force for it to start for example
2609300	2616980	climbing uphill um that's internally generated of course it's not magic uh the adaptive system the
2616980	2623620	agent uh has stored energy that it's extracted from the environment so for example humans that
2623620	2630420	are eating food and there's a metabolic process that's driving this but uh still yeah you with
2630420	2636900	living systems that where information has causal power uh basically the trajectory of the system
2636900	2643460	can't be predicted by these fundamental laws of physics um Philip Ball the journalist that
2644180	2650100	has been talking about this um his recent article which caused a lot of controversy between like
2650820	2656100	the reductionist like talking about free will and agency um and there's a lot of confusion around
2656100	2662100	that so people like Jerry Coyne were like trying to shoot it down and yeah hopefully I can talk about
2662100	2669460	that um I guess we'll talk about that next time because there's a lot of uh confusion about what
2669460	2675220	we're saying when we say something has agency or free will but his example is if you throw throw a
2675220	2682100	ball and a bird off a tower and you can predict what one is going to do you can't predict what the
2682100	2688820	other is going to do um interestingly though I would say that the bird's not completely unpredictable
2688820	2692580	you can predict that it's not going to hit the ground it's not going to splat on the ground
2693140	2698180	it's going to fly away uh you have to understand the bird in terms of its goals so you have to
2698180	2703380	understand you know the bird and its environment and the information that got built up through
2703380	2710420	evolution and then we can start to predict the bird uh its statistical behavior so inanimate
2710420	2716420	systems you can pretty much precisely predict the movement unless they're chaotic systems which is
2716420	2722980	another story but with life um yeah it's not predictable in that same way with like low level
2723540	2728980	laws of physics but uh I'm arguing that actually life is more predictable than we've thought
2729540	2736740	but you need things like uh non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and for example uh free
2736740	2744100	energy principle um so you can say that you know an organism will try to minimize free energy or
2744820	2750660	minimize the difference between uh its models prediction and reality so it will try to minimize
2750660	2758580	prediction error and that's a way that we can start to describe uh behaviors statistically so
2759860	2765540	um you know was there another one yep can I ask the second question yeah I I know I didn't
2765540	2771940	completely answer that but uh that will require like the all of the points that I would get into
2771940	2776500	in the second talk but it's a great question yeah I would have written in a larger margin if I had
2776580	2784180	more time the second question is from Joseph Clark who wrote first complimented your talk and
2784180	2791140	let you knew that you were an interesting guy so then the question was how far do you think the
2791140	2797700	universe can organize itself and what does that look like okay great that's a perfect question
2797700	2803380	to lead into the next part and hopefully by the end of this uh we will have some sort of answer for
2803380	2807620	that which is good because I when I started making the beginning of the presentation I was
2807620	2812020	going to get to consciousness and free will and I ran out of time so there's been a lot of talk
2812020	2818820	about things that I won't get to but that we will get to um so uh the story starts with the second
2818820	2828260	law um so the second law of thermodynamics as popularly popularly understood says that uh
2828260	2836580	systems naturally become increasingly disordered um that's really just because of the large scale
2836580	2844180	effects of chance so there are many ways to be disordered and there are relatively fewer ways
2844180	2852580	to be patterned um so a system that's this collective of particles so this evolving
2852580	2859780	ensemble of particles uh will naturally tend to move towards a configuration that's completely
2859780	2867220	spread out and mixed up there are no uh energy gradient so no work can be extracted that's a
2867220	2875140	state of equilibrium so we are going to use this word thermodynamic equilibrium uh to mean death
2875140	2881300	in disorder so life wants to resist the tendency towards equilibrium and wants to stay ordered
2882100	2886500	what's interesting about this is that it applies to all this is kind of like
2887380	2894260	where the free energy principle in first sense Bayesian brain hypothesis it frames everything
2894260	2899780	this way so I thought it was a good way to kind of frame it here is that you start with the second
2899780	2907300	law and any conceivable system any ordered system for it to continue to persist has to resist this
2907300	2917700	tendency so um basically uh Schrodinger the guy everybody knows from quantum mechanics in the
2917700	2925060	in the cat thought experiment he wrote a book called what is life in the 40s and uh basically
2925060	2928980	kind of solved this paradox like if there's a second law and things become more disordered
2928980	2933780	than what's with life and what's with the biosphere and all this complexity that we see around us
2934740	2940980	is and he explained actually Boltzmann explained this before him um but Boltzmann said a lot to
2940980	2948020	contradict this as well um or just didn't follow this to its implications but Schrodinger explained
2948020	2955060	that open systems by feeding off uh free energy in the environment so free energy is just energy
2955060	2961780	that uh you can extract work from so it's ordered energy as opposed to energy that's been dissipated
2961780	2967780	in the form of heat you can't extract energy useful energy from that energy it's still there it's
2967780	2974100	just spread out and it's it's you can't harness it collecting it would cost more than you get out
2974100	2981620	of it so um Schrodinger explained that uh if a system can get free energy which he called negative
2981620	2992020	entropy or energy uh negentropies was called by uh someone later um so to understand how ordered
2992020	2999140	systems stay ordered uh you basically need to understand that they have to uh constantly be
2999140	3006100	extracting free energy from the environment the moment that they can't extract more free energy
3006100	3015460	is the moment that the system dies and decays to equilibrium so um basically uh the second
3015460	3024020	law is not violated by life because um in this effort to stay far from equilibrium life it keeps
3024020	3030020	extracting that ordered free energy and keeps dissipating it as heat so so it's basically
3030020	3039140	exporting entropy into the environment so the order um that is maintained uh is paid for
3039780	3046020	by the dissipated energy which comes becomes thermal entropy so there are multiple definitions
3046020	3050020	of entropy so you have thermal entropy which is heat entropy and then statistical entropy
3051540	3058100	which explains thermal entropy but it has a broader domain of application so you can talk
3058100	3065860	about a shuffling a deck of cards and you can talk about like the statistical entropy increasing
3066820	3071780	if the deck is ordered and it starts becoming mixed up through the shuffling but the deck
3071780	3078900	of cards the thermal entropy uh isn't changing much at all so there's different types of entropy
3078900	3086100	there's also information entropy which has to do with the um uh the number of messages that
3086100	3092340	could be sent across the channel instead of um the number of states that a system can be in
3092340	3098820	the number of microstates without changing the macro state macro state or uh the kind of um
3098820	3104420	collective properties of the system there's a really neat relationship between statistical
3104420	3111300	entropy and information entropy which i won't talk about here it was really fleshed out by uh et
3111300	3121460	janes uh but yeah so information and entropy like go hand in hand um just to give a little more
3121460	3127780	context before we get into the details uh david doidge and this great ted talk um called after
3127780	3131780	billions of years of monotony the universe is waking up says if one can speak of a cosmic war
3131780	3137300	it's a war between monotony and novelty between stasis and creativity and in this war our side
3137300	3143620	is not destined to lose if we choose to apply our unique capacity to create explanatory knowledge
3143620	3149380	we could win so that's very different than brian green story and it kind of gets at the second
3149380	3156340	question that was asked there how how far can this complexity increase go and so this kind of fore
3156340	3161220	shadows that maybe it doesn't have a limit and that seems you know most people think that would
3161220	3165060	go against the second law of thermodynamics we're going to see why that's not necessarily true
3165860	3171380	um but you can also see this cosmic war as this fight between order versus disorder life versus
3171380	3179380	entropy and knowledge versus uncertainty or ignorance um but is life's battle against disorder
3179940	3185860	good versus evil or yin and yang so i'm going to kind of argue that these two things kind of
3186740	3193140	have this uh you can describe their relationship as causally dependent and it's kind of like this
3193140	3203780	dialectic between life and uh disorder um and it is through this sort of uh interaction that
3204580	3211460	creates progress so we have some eastern ideas mentioned again um but when i was writing the
3211460	3217060	book a friend that practices buddhism called me and told me about this interdependent
3217060	3221380	co-arising idea which i thought was really cool so we're going to come up with this what we call
3221380	3227060	popper's principle which is uh problems create progress we're going to see that this problem
3227620	3236100	of entropy that this tendency towards decay is what actually forces systems to evolve basically
3236100	3241460	it forces them to search what's called the configuration space for the faith space for
3241460	3247620	the state space to find configurations that are good at extracting energy and that allows it to
3247700	3252980	stay far from equilibrium so we're going to have some figures soon so this stuff that's
3252980	3259860	kind of abstract becomes a little bit more concrete just out of respect to the earlier
3259860	3266900	request how about you check the time and feel then how fast you'd like to continue however much you
3266900	3271060	want to present and then if you want to take any questions but first just check the time and let
3271620	3278900	just i i how i i didn't uh i didn't uh notice when we started so about how long have i been
3278900	3288420	going i would say five zero minutes really okay how long can we go we can go another
3289460	3298180	uh 99 minutes okay um i'll try to go through it a little bit faster um but yeah so um
3298420	3306020	um but if we use all the time i told you yesterday that i was feeling uh oh i had a sore throat
3306020	3310020	and uh the sore throat's better today i'm hopped up on cold medicine i'm sure i'm gonna
3310660	3316500	i'm gonna pay for tomorrow but um yeah if we use all the time with questions that would be good
3316500	3325540	uh so in our everyday experiment experience things don't naturally become ordered unless
3325540	3332660	someone intervenes rooms get messier buildings erode uh so we already talked about this trodinger's
3333460	3339380	solution so we can think of life as a game uh so life has always been playing a game against
3339380	3346260	the second law of thermodynamics there is another narrative that i won't go into but life is also
3346260	3353060	an energy flow channel so life by existing and computing and trying to stay far from equilibrium
3353860	3360820	is also increasing entropy uh actually the universe of life will increase entropy at a
3360820	3367220	faster rate than the universe without life um which is pretty interesting so it's again not
3367220	3373060	necessarily that life it's like battling against entropy and in many ways it increases entropy but
3373940	3378580	there's also this story i guess what it's trying to battle is the tendency towards disorder so it
3378580	3384260	depends on what type of entropy you're talking about um so the challenge in the game of life
3384260	3390100	which applies to you as well as other simpler adaptive systems is to resist that tendency
3390100	3396900	so this gives life a goal for teleology so teleology was associated with kind of this mystical thing but
3398020	3405860	basically we'll we're seeing that teleology is just uh agency it's just a result goal-oriented
3405860	3411860	behavior as a result of the information that's been accumulated over evolution so teleology
3412740	3419140	the book uh tries to naturalize teleology and just say that they're these goal-oriented systems
3419140	3426340	that behave different uh because they are acquiring information through Darwinian evolution um
3426980	3432420	so life has to extract free energy that's how it stays in the game of life and to extract free
3432420	3438660	energy it's it's not a simple task so the computational task of extracting free energy
3439780	3445380	requires that the uh system acquire information about its environment otherwise it can't find
3445380	3452180	energy uh it also requires that the system model its environment so the information is creating
3452180	3461460	this predictive model this generative model and it is um that model that allows it to continuously
3462020	3469140	find free energy um so we will explain that life strategy is it searches through a configuration
3469140	3474980	space for solutions to the problem of survival through trial and error search uh variation
3474980	3481620	and selection so we we know about evolution there's this genetic variation in natural selection
3481620	3487700	and uh we're going to argue that that process that mechanism is much broader the evolutionary
3487700	3493540	mechanism is actually the mechanism of the scientific method and of adaptive learning um
3493540	3497780	and that mechanism is also a process that accumulates evidence-based knowledge so it's
3497780	3503060	also a process of Bayesian inference we're going to explain why so here we have those different
3503060	3512180	mechanisms with different names um so it's not included here but uh so if life is a game
3512180	3518260	there are levels to this game uh and the levels we're going to see are these uh evolutionary
3518260	3526660	transitions every time life graduates to this uh more uh complex hierarchical system like when
3527380	3531860	single-celled organisms come together to form a multi-cellular organism and multi-cellular
3531860	3540420	organisms come together to form communities like societies uh that you can view these evolutionary
3540500	3550340	transitions as as life graduating to a new level so um we're going to talk about how adaptive
3550340	3556260	information gets built up through evolution and uh we're calling that knowledge it's nice to have
3556260	3562020	that word knowledge because this process of an adaptive system acquiring this information is
3562020	3567380	actually reducing its uncertainty about the environment so it's it's reducing its ignorance
3567380	3574740	about all the ways the surrounding world could potentially surprise it uh so knowledge is a
3574740	3582100	nice word some philosophers like old school philosophers might have issue with that um because
3582100	3588020	in some teachings like knowledge is something that like conscious beings with like awareness have
3588020	3593380	but we're calling any adaptive information knowledge and it's that more of a technical
3593380	3600740	definition because knowledge is that information which reduces uncertainty and you could actually
3600740	3606340	quantify this process of evolution terence deacon has talked a lot about how you can do that with
3606980	3615060	information measures um so just to explain this why is knowledge something that matters like does
3615060	3620500	it have causal power or is it all just this this billiard ball universe where it's like these
3620500	3626100	particles bump into each other and you can basically use uh fundamental laws of physics
3626100	3630580	to describe like the trajectory of all the particles in the universe this is saying no
3631220	3636820	that the information that gets built up through evolution has causal power such that these systems
3636820	3642660	start to behave in ways that are different than what would be predicted from uh something our
3642660	3649060	new laws so we also have this process of anti accretion that sarah walker likes to talk about
3650100	3657060	but anti so anti accretion is uh basically we're familiar with uh planets pulling in matter
3657060	3664260	so bodies like asteroids because gravity pulls matter in naturally but anti accretion is when a
3664260	3672180	planet is ejecting matter and uh in many cases what well so the the only time we really see
3672740	3680980	anti accretion uh is when you have a planet with a life on it so um right now
3682980	3688740	bits of biosphere so humans and space rockets are being sent to other celestial bodies so that's a
3688740	3696340	form of anti accretion uh sending up satellites you won't see a satellite get sent out if you see
3696340	3702180	that in the universe uh like you're looking at some other solar system and you see a body
3703060	3708180	sent out and put into orbit from a planet that's an indication that life is there that's a biosignature
3709140	3714420	so she says that anti accretion requires comprehenders specifically the existence of
3714420	3725380	physical systems with knowledge of newton's laws um so what does it all mean um it means we need
3725380	3736740	knowledge uh to uh keep us out of thermodynamic equilibrium um so how do we acquire knowledge uh
3736740	3743220	science is the most uh is the most salient example of the causal power of knowledge so
3743860	3751220	science uh has uh eradicated lethal diseases built a global communication network called the
3751220	3757140	internet and created weapons of apocalyptic power it's not always good this power of knowledge but um
3758660	3765060	we see that there's something about the scientific method which is efficient at
3765300	3771060	uh accumulating knowledge so we're going to talk about why and that's where we get into
3771060	3776500	carl popper and evolutionary epistemology um so we know knowledge is important
3778260	3781780	carl poppers says we're always faced with practical problems and out of these grow
3781780	3786980	sometimes theoretical problems before we try to solve some of our problems by proposing theories
3787780	3796100	so uh popper stresses that all of science starts with a problem either theoretical
3796100	3804020	or practical um and it is that problem that forces us to seek out a solution so we can already see
3804020	3812020	why this principle that i've called popper's principle uh says that problems create progress
3812340	3820900	so some of these theories that we make to try to solve our problems will be wrong they'll be errors
3821540	3827940	um but the idea with science is that those errors get filtered out by a process of testing your
3827940	3837140	theories and a peer review process which gives criticism so uh knowledge is really uh for knowledge
3837140	3845060	for us to know that some piece of information is knowledge it really needs to be tested and uh
3845060	3850020	we call that evidence-based knowledge or evidence-based information so it's really the only true
3850020	3857060	kind of knowledge because you don't know if something's true until you test it for example um
3857860	3867460	um the world doesn't look round from a naive perspective it looks flat so for example um
3867460	3873940	someone who had the first idea you know and i'm sure it was before anybody famous we knew someone
3873940	3881860	had this idea and probably people blew it off but um uh some things that are true about reality
3881860	3887700	are not immediate immediately apparent from like sensory observation from since data so we really
3887700	3893700	need to test our theories if we are going to be sure about them um so what popper found out was
3893700	3900740	the scientific method is an algorithm you call that algorithm conjecture and refutation and uh
3901780	3906900	basically this is the method of hypothesis testing so you have a problem you believe can be solved
3906900	3912740	you make an informed guess or conjecture to see if your theory can be refuted prove false by testing
3912740	3921620	its predictions so uh people have pointed out like john cambell uh call first in that uh science is a
3921620	3926580	process of inference so it recognizes statistical patterns and trends in nature that we can use to
3926580	3930980	make increasingly accurate predictions um it would not be inaccurate than to say that the
3930980	3936660	function or purpose of science is to generate predictive knowledge um and we can characterize
3936660	3940980	that as a process of inference which basically means that scientists draw logical conclusions
3940980	3947380	about the way the world works uh based on evidence based information acquired in the past but with
3947380	3956420	never present awareness that the information can and will lead to um to new conclusions and deeper
3956420	3961380	understanding so when we recognize this we also have to recognize that all of our models will
3961380	3966580	have uncertainty um so we should never think that our models right every model is going to be
3966580	3973300	proved wrong in some way but through the scientific process uh the idea is that we get closer and
3973300	3979940	closer to truth so we can never reach perfect truth but in this model you can actually get
3979940	3984660	closer to it so in some senses it's different than like post-modernist philosophy that says
3984660	3991380	there is no objective truth there is an objective truth um uh but we can never know it but we can
3991380	3998100	get closer to it uh so once Papa understood that knowledge the knowledge generating mechanism behind
3998100	4002660	science success was conjecturing refutation he realized that human learning which begins at
4002660	4007620	birth and continues to death uses the same problem solving algorithm although the developmental
4007620	4013300	psychology literature called the method trial and error so because life is constantly presenting
4013300	4017140	us with new challenges such as the need to get from one place to another a problem that inspires
4017220	4022180	babies to learn to walk we must constantly try out new behavioral solutions we can think of these
4022180	4027380	actions as guesses about how to survive or if you prefer experiments innovating equilibrium or
4027380	4037220	predictions for persistence and they will often fail um so this is Dan Dennett's idea of life
4037220	4041060	exploring this design space we're going to talk about how it does so through evolution but we're
4041060	4045140	still talking about science here and adaptive learning on an abstract level we can imagine
4045140	4049220	a certain practical problem as a challenge one with the solution that exists somewhere out there
4049220	4053220	in the space of possibilities just waiting to be found by someone's sufficiently motivated and
4053220	4058980	clever it may take some time but if the possibility space the space of possible solutions is continuously
4058980	4065540	explored in an efficient way eventually a solution will be discovered so excuse me trial and error
4065540	4074820	learning explores the solution space um so just to give you a clear example of how adaptive
4074820	4081060	learning uh is kind of this form of hypothesis testing so whenever we have a problem in life and
4081060	4086420	we don't know the correct solution to a problem in advance um we naturally begin with those potential
4086420	4091620	solutions that are closer to our starting point in the solution space for sampling so for example
4091620	4096980	if a baby reaches for its bottle and barely misses it'll adjust its behavior slightly which minimizes
4096980	4104660	the chances of making an error um so our instincts may nudges in the general direction of a solution
4104740	4111700	but the instinct alone is not enough uh we have to try out what you could call a behavioral
4111700	4119700	conjecture and when it fails uh we try something new so that's kind of like a new theory and uh
4119700	4125620	it's essentially the old one but with a little twist and if that behavioral solution is remembered
4125620	4133140	then it's gets stored for future use ready to be repeated but also adapted if necessary um
4133780	4140340	but in humans so the baby example reaching for the bottle let's say it misses the bottle it
4140340	4145380	won't get a reward signal it won't get a little surge of dopamine so if it corrects and it gets
4145380	4151220	closer it gets a little reward signal this is reinforcement learning but basically this adaptive
4151220	4158260	learning process is a process of making theories and eliminating those theories that are errors
4158340	4170660	so uh popper saw that scientific knowledge and the evolutionary process uh were also connected so
4170660	4177940	not only is science uh adaptive learning uh both of those things are extensions of the
4177940	4183140	evolutionary process so he says in science theories are highly competitive we discuss them
4183140	4186900	critically we test them and we eliminate the series which we judge to be less good in solving
4186900	4191220	the problems which we wish to solve so only that's theories those which are most fit survive in
4191220	4196580	the struggle this is the way science grows um so that's kind of nice like showing you
4197220	4203780	really how this is an evolutionary process um not only a science and evolutionary process
4203780	4211380	the converse is true evolution is a scientific process so it is clear this is another quote
4211380	4215380	it is clear that this view of the progress of science is very similar to darwin's view of
4215380	4220500	natural selection by the way of the elimination of the unfit of the errors in the evolution of
4220500	4226100	life the errors in the attempts at adaptation which is a trial and error process analogously
4226100	4234260	science works by trial theory making and by the elimination of errors um i might pause in a second
4234260	4242020	just to um see if everybody understands this but i have a few more slides so um evolutionary
4242020	4250100	algorithms uh also use this mechanism but it's called generate and test so i didn't mention this uh
4250100	4256500	the mechanism of evolution is variation and selection so we have these algorithms that are
4256500	4261700	equivalent conjecture and error mutation trial and error variation and selection we also have
4261700	4270260	generated test so in machine learning evolutionary algorithms uh have this method uh generating
4270340	4275700	tests um possible solutions are generated into an actual solution is found and these
4275700	4279300	solutions accumulate in some memory store while the errors are filtered out and forgotten
4280340	4284020	in science the solutions are theories or models that actually predict some natural phenomena
4284660	4290820	and the successful full ones accumulate in peer review journals and textbooks so um
4292100	4295940	we see that these processes are equivalent and we're actually going to see that it's this
4295940	4304500	Bayesian process uh that adaptation is also a process of uh the model of the organism
4305220	4310980	becoming optimized uh decreasing its prediction error so that it can more efficiently extract
4310980	4321140	free energy from an itch to stay ordered so we get this principle um that all evolutionary
4321140	4327620	processes are learning processes and all learning processes are evolutionary processes um Conrad
4327620	4334980	Lorenz a Nobel Prize winning zoologist was also a pioneer of evolutionary epistemology and he made
4334980	4342900	the statement life is a cognitive process um so if this is true and there's this functional
4342900	4347780	equivalence between the mechanisms driving evolution learning and science then that implies
4347780	4356420	that adaptation uh or the genetic information that um uh corresponds to those physical adaptations
4357060	4363140	are uh equivalent is equivalent to scientific knowledge they're actually the same thing so
4363940	4369460	to kind of make this relationship clear biological adaptation represents knowledge
4369460	4373220	of the environment and the knowledge we acquire through learning and science reflects adaptation
4373220	4377860	to the environment so we see that there's no meaningful distinction between adaptive information
4377860	4381540	and scientific knowledge both allow life to predict an uncertain world control matter
4381540	4387300	constrained chaos and we construct order from disorder so the very same property that is responsible
4387300	4394660	for organic matter leaving the planet in spaceships so this anti-accretion uh is the same uh property
4394660	4401460	that allows organisms to climb uphill seemingly defying the force of gravity of course uh the laws
4401460	4408660	of physics aren't violated in any way but uh living systems are not constrained by the laws
4408660	4416260	of physics through a inanimate systems are so some examples a dolphin stream modern design
4416260	4421380	which is a product of the information stored in its genome contains the knowledge of hydrodynamics
4421940	4426500	an eagle's wing design contains the knowledge of aerodynamics not only can we be certain that
4426500	4431540	engineers see knowledge in these functional structures uh there should be little doubt that
4431540	4438180	they inspired uh our machines and and without that information I don't think we would have come to
4438180	4447540	those inventions at least not any time soon um camouflage uh on an organism uh represents
4447540	4455860	knowledge of the environment so kind of bridging this idea of evolutionary epistemology that
4455860	4461940	evolution builds up knowledge and that science is an extension of the evolutionary process uh
4462740	4470580	making a bridge between that and Bayesian inference uh requires this uh relationship between adaptation
4470580	4476900	and statistical correlation so physicist Carlo Revelli which who has gotten really interested
4476900	4484180	in explaining how this information that underlies agency that behavior that we see with living
4484180	4491540	systems gets built up through evolution uh he wrote a great essay it won the foundational
4491540	4499700	questions institute essay contest um a few years ago but this work was based on the work of David
4499700	4509300	Wolpert and Artem Kolchinski Artem Kolchinski and basically shows how this adaptation builds up
4509300	4514580	information in the system that information is really statistical correlation between
4514580	4520420	the organism and its environment so here's the simplest example it's a bacterium performing
4520420	4528900	chemotaxis um so bacteria so chemotaxis is basically uh a bacterium will uh swim in the
4528900	4535460	direction of food and swim away from toxins so basically it's detecting this chemical gradient
4535540	4542820	that it follows um but so we can see in this example um and this isn't the case for all
4543380	4547780	species but you can imagine that a bacterium that swims to the left when nutrients are on the left
4548500	4559540	uh prosperous compared to a bacterium that swims at random um so uh with this behavior
4559540	4566340	where it's swimming towards food um that is the product of a chance mutation so it's in some sense
4566340	4573780	it's an accident but when it discovers that solution that organism is more likely to reproduce
4574580	4581860	so that solution gets retained in the population it gets sort of frozen hardwired in and um
4582500	4589300	so the process of adaptation is a process that builds up a statistical correlation between
4589940	4598180	the system the agent and its environment and so that shared correlation represents
4598180	4603780	mutual information so mutual information is information that's shared between the environment
4603780	4613700	and the organism and uh just to explain that a little bit more uh this correlation uh basically
4613700	4620820	as this correlation gets built up it's creating predictive knowledge so um John Maynard Smith
4620820	4627060	cites Fred Dretsky who did kind of the pioneering work applying Shannon's information theory to
4627060	4632660	try to quantify evolution so Dretsky argues that if some variable a is correlated with the
4632660	4637540	second variable b then we can say that b carries information about a for example if the occurrence
4637540	4641700	of rain is correlated with a particular cloud then the type of cloud tells us whether it would
4641700	4648660	rain so that's from a great essay called the concept of information biology um so we can see
4649620	4656980	that you have this little rhyming equation here adaptation equals statistical correlation
4657060	4664980	equals mutual information and because that uh shared information allows the organism to predict
4664980	4671140	its environment better this process is also a process of model optimization so the predictive
4671140	4679860	model of the organism as it adapts starts to become more accurate and so this whole process can be
4679860	4687940	seen as a free energy minimization process um of course that's information theoretic free energy
4687940	4692740	it's the free energy of first instance principle we're not talking about thermodynamic free energy
4692740	4700340	anyone wants to ask a question or gets confused about that let me know but it's basically uh those
4700340	4706580	things are related and it's something that's not mentioned enough uh minimizing information
4706580	4713140	theoretic free energy which is just minimizing the prediction error of your model is what allows
4713140	4720660	the organism to minimize environmental free energy so by acquiring information reducing
4721780	4728820	the information theoretic free energy allows the organism to extract energy and reduce
4729460	4734420	thermodynamic free energy it minimizes the free energy and the environment converts it into entropy
4737140	4744020	so we kind of see how this it's getting into universal Bayesianism as it becomes more correlated
4744020	4749620	it gains information about its niche and therefore becomes a better predictor of that niche um
4750500	4755540	so that's what adaptation is it's the genome of the species accumulating information that reduces
4755540	4764660	the average organism's uncertainty regarding the environment so um the genome is a knowledge
4764740	4770580	repository of solutions to environmental challenges that allows an organism with no brain and no
4770580	4775860	mind to anticipate events in the environment so in this theory as I mentioned before consciousness
4775860	4784340	comes later it comes with self-modeling capacity and a bacterium would be kind of a zombie agent
4784340	4791060	it would have agency and it would move with purpose but that is not enough for mind or at
4791060	4798180	least mind defined as consciousness uh if you want to say that mind is just information processing
4798180	4803540	then yes there is mind in these systems but that's very different than saying that the system has a
4803540	4809140	subjective experience uh in a first person perspective that will come in the next talk but
4809140	4817060	that uh it's it's harder um so that information stored in memory is integrated into a statistical
4817060	4822580	or predictive model that determines the causal control system's behavioral repertoire or the full
4822580	4827940	range of behaviors an organism is capable of and it is this mapping of sensory inputs to motor
4827940	4832900	outputs that makes the organism move in ways that we normally associate with mind or consciousness
4833780	4839300	um crawlferston in a great eon article says all biological processes can be construed as
4839300	4844820	performing some form of inference I think I already read that um but the free energy principle
4844820	4851540	for those aren't familiar um we've already explained it but the Bayesian brain hypothesis
4852100	4857140	and the free energy principle are the same thing uh the difference is that the free energy principle
4857140	4862820	applies to all other adaptive systems where the other one is just focusing on brains but
4863460	4870820	friston realized that this you know is a model and a process that applies to any system that's
4870820	4877140	trying to resist the tendency towards disorder so any system to stay to continue persisting
4877140	4883620	longer than we would expect uh naturally it must engage in Bayesian like learning to deal with
4883620	4893300	environment uncertainty how much time do I have left roughly uh still more than enough
4894020	4900420	okay keep going um I'm definitely more than half through I'd say I'm two-thirds of the way through
4901060	4907380	so uh John Campbell has this great uh paper called universal Darwinism as a process of
4907380	4913620	Bayesian inference that I kept coming across as I was trying to understand uh non-equilibrium
4913620	4920500	thermodynamics and information theory um yeah I should say actually I should have
4920500	4926020	got in the books uh showed you each book but um there's a great book called the origin and nature
4926020	4931780	of life on earth by uh Santa Fe Institute's Eric Smith and Harold Morowitz uh Morowitz was a professor
4931780	4939220	of mine Eric uh is a friend that uh we would have these foundations of the mine uh guild it was
4939220	4946660	like a consciousness club that would meet at the Krasnow Institute where I got my PhD and um so their
4946660	4953620	book the origin of life on the origin of life in chapter eight actually gets into this information
4953620	4959460	theory and uh this this Bayesian inference and describes the origin of life and the evolution
4960020	4967140	of life as a process of Bayesian model selection and so that was kind of what connected
4967140	4971380	non-equilibrium statistical mechanics to these to this Bayesian brain hypothesis
4972100	4978500	and I realized that you know these theories were kind of converging on the same ideas so
4978500	4983620	John Campbell wrote this paper in 2016 he says Bayesian inference is an algorithm for the accumulation
4983620	4988980	of evidence-based knowledge this algorithm is now seen to operate over a wide range of evolutionary
4988980	4993380	processes including natural selection the evolution of mental models and cultural evolutionary
4993380	5002260	processes notably including science itself so uh when we say that evolution is a process of
5002260	5007540	Bayesian model selection in the book I mentioned with Eric and Morowitz actually characterized
5007540	5014980	evolution as an inference engine uh we're basically saying that when organisms that aren't fit get
5014980	5023540	weeded out uh that's basically models that aren't predictive getting eliminated so the organisms
5023540	5029940	that persist are the models that were able to predict the environment best so inference and
5029940	5037220	prediction are kind of the same thing uh since the word inference is a little obscure I guess um so
5037300	5046100	just to make this point a little more clear um since nature is complex and intrinsically unpredictable
5046100	5052820	uh the model of an organism is at some point guaranteed to fail when reality surprises it
5052820	5060420	with the unexpected so and that's what the free energy principle is about minimizing surprise is
5060420	5066660	the same thing as minimizing prediction error so an organism gets eaten by a predator a baby
5066660	5075060	fails to reach his bottle a scientific theory fails to explain new data um basically when any of
5075060	5078580	these things happens it means that the model used to predict reality is not completely accurate
5079220	5083140	it contains a certain amount of prediction error needs to be corrected so what's the solution
5083140	5087300	try something new the old model worked well enough up to that point so don't ditch it just
5087300	5092020	vary it a bit and see if it performs better if it does not reduce surprise eliminate that variant
5092020	5096020	and try again if prediction error is reduced replace the old model with the new one so that
5096020	5099460	it becomes the reigning theory and the design template for new variants to be based upon
5100500	5104740	when a model has been updated in this way due to natural selection adaptive learning or
5104740	5109620	experimental testing we can say that knowledge has been acquired and environmental uncertainty reduced
5111540	5118580	so here we have an image um I should say that uh infinity maps uh German software mapping company
5119220	5126500	helped me create these images uh Oliver Wan I have to uh do a big thanks to him um this image
5126500	5133540	has a little bit more going on than I would want right now but you could see that um basically
5135220	5143140	this represents two different mechanisms for uh learning and adaptation so this one on the top
5143140	5149140	that we're going to talk about first is the normal uh competitive evolution sort of Darwinian
5149140	5155540	survival of the fittest while this mechanism over here is the mechanism of self-organization
5156740	5163620	so let's first talk about the normal type of evolution we're familiar with and show that
5164500	5170100	how this process of evolution that works through variation and selection actually
5170500	5182420	uh generates predictive information and uh creates a model which is uh which encodes knowledge
5182420	5189140	of the biologically relevant regularities in the environment so first we have this
5190020	5198580	this is a bacterium over here and so this is the simplest model um you have an organism
5198580	5203060	that's an embodied theory or a best guess about how to stay far from equilibrium
5203060	5210580	so evolutionary epistemology sees organisms themselves as embodied theories so evolution
5210580	5220020	is basically testing these different models so uh it basically reproduces and we know that
5220020	5229860	because there are going to be errors in uh in that process uh the genome will get changed
5231620	5238980	slightly and you will get a generation of progeny that all are slightly different
5239540	5244660	they have slightly different configurations um some of these configurations will be better
5244740	5249220	at extracting energy and predicting the environment than others and the ones that uh
5250420	5254020	aren't good at predicting the environment they get filtered out by natural selection
5254740	5259940	so here we see design four is the winning design because it's the best predictor and it's the best
5259940	5270340	predictor because it's the best extractor of energy and so that uh design uh that that organism
5270340	5276820	gets to reproduce and then you have another generation uh of designs that are slightly
5276820	5283700	different and this process is an iterative process just like science and hypothesis testing so
5284740	5292900	over generations you will start to get uh designs that are better adapted to the environment
5293940	5299620	which we've explained means that they will be more correlated with the environment
5300740	5309300	and being more correlated means being a better predictor um so the knowledge that's left over
5309300	5314420	after this process is the adaptive information stored in genetic material that reduces
5314420	5320100	environmental uncertainty and you see that this process will ultimately lead to the evolution
5320740	5325780	towards the the best possible design so it's it's an optimization a lot of people don't think
5326580	5331380	that evolution is optimizing anything there's been this you know kind of philosophy that
5331380	5337860	evolution does just good enough but we actually see that in terms of the computation that it
5337860	5345300	does to stay far from equilibrium that it's actually optimized for being almost maximally
5345300	5349860	efficient with its use of energy it approaches something close to what's called the land hour
5349860	5357780	limit which david will put at sfi is written about but uh life is much more efficient uh
5357780	5364420	with computation in terms of energy uh supply needed compared to all of our technology so the
5364420	5371060	human brain can do uh solve problems that even our bests like ai systems can't solve and it does
5371060	5378660	so running on uh the equivalent of one household light bulb so we'll come back to this self
5378660	5386740	organization process oh well actually we'll get into that right now so this is the normal uh
5386740	5391940	process that we think about when we think about evolution generating knowledge predictive knowledge
5393060	5399540	and so that's called phylogenetic learning uh phylogenetic refers to these like generations so
5399540	5404740	the learning is generational the organisms don't really learn because they don't have brains they
5404740	5410020	not able to update their model in real time so learning is at the level of the population
5411060	5418340	and for learning to occur organisms have to die before brains basically you have to have this uh
5418340	5427460	competition uh for there to be a learning process however there's also self organization when these
5427460	5433140	organisms don't compete but actually find a configuration find it discover a collective
5433140	5439540	configuration through their somewhat random interactions with each other and when they
5439540	5446980	find this collective configuration through trial and error um basically the configurations
5446980	5454260	that are better at extracting energy will be the ones that are retained um so
5454500	5464020	Donald Campbell father of evolutionary epistemology uh explain this process this evolutionary process
5464820	5469700	by which self organization works as blind variation and selective retention
5470340	5476900	or we can think of it as selection for persistence or stability so fitness kind of there's a
5476900	5483220	Dawkins quote I think I come out where Richard Dawkins said Darwin's uh survival of the fittest
5483220	5491140	is really um just uh more specific instance of a more general law of survival of the stable
5492020	5499620	so when we think about being fit at the beginning we're talking about just being uh stable being
5499620	5504820	able to find energy if you can't do that it doesn't matter whether you have agents that you're
5504820	5510020	competing with or not because if you can't get energy it doesn't matter if there are other people
5510020	5518500	competing for it that you won't survive so you don't need replication with variation to evolve
5518500	5523940	that's what this is this model is saying um and Stuart Kauffman from the Santa Fe Institute has
5524740	5529060	been talking about the importance of this marriage between Darwinian evolution and
5529060	5538100	self-organization but basically uh because there's not this replication process um this is how
5538100	5545860	evolution occurs so you have a system that's a collection of components parts these parts can be
5545860	5553700	molecules or they could be agents and when these molecules are pushed far from equilibrium by a
5553700	5558820	flow of energy of course humans are eating food and metabolizing energy so they're being powered
5558820	5565140	by energy flows as well the system blindly explores various configurations in the space of
5565140	5572420	possible designs via trial and error so this system will move through a series of configurations
5572420	5578980	and those configurations that allow the system to extract sufficient energy to stay out of equilibrium
5578980	5585860	will get retained while the configurations that don't allow for energy extraction will
5585860	5591700	will get filtered out either the system will collapse and have to try a new configuration um
5592580	5599460	or it'll just revert to the the previous stable uh configuration and it will continue
5600180	5607540	trying to explore that configuration space um I should have said like here's a good example
5607540	5613140	like here's a depiction of this configuration space we're talking about life exploring the design
5613140	5622740	space so basically you have a designer configuration and then uh you get these uh different this
5622740	5629620	exploration of different configurations that are very close to the configuration you started out with
5631380	5637860	so you know I was thinking about giving a talk on the origin of life but I couldn't get into all
5637860	5642340	this cool Bayesian stuff that's what the first part of the book is about what's really interesting
5642340	5647460	is that we're finding that self-organization as mentioned is a Darwinian process so there's actually
5647460	5653060	a name for this dissipative adaptation and it shows that this evolution towards these more
5653060	5658340	stable configurations dissipate more energy when this happens at the level of organisms that we're
5658340	5664500	talking about it shouldn't be surprising that it dissipates more energy because basically
5665220	5671460	as the organism evolves to be better at extracting energy all that energy it's extracting to maintain
5671460	5678500	far from equilibrium is being converted into thermal entropy so all self-organizing processes
5678500	5685540	are really dissipative adaptation processes at different levels so this process philosophers
5685540	5691780	would say is multiply realizable so this process can happen at different scales and that's exactly
5691780	5698740	what we see like right here the same process so you would have like a society like exploring
5698740	5703460	different governance systems and it doesn't know which government system is going to work
5704020	5710020	the best the forehand it tries it if it doesn't work well like the fall of Rome
5711540	5713940	it will collapse and then it will reassemble
5717460	5717780	so
5722020	5727700	just to wrap up the origin of life so we have this process of dissipative adaptation and if it's
5727700	5732900	being pushed by the flow of energy and it's doing this process here where it's finding increasingly
5734100	5738420	stable configurations collective configurations then
5741860	5746820	basically what will emerge is an autocatalytic set we'll define that later but basically
5747940	5752020	it's I'm losing a lot of terms from philosophy I was going to say like and
5752020	5755940	it's the beginning of an auto poetic agent so like a self-maintaining agent
5756740	5761860	and simplest form is a chemical system that produces outputs which are then
5762420	5768900	fed back into the system so that the system can self-amplify it's basically creating
5769700	5776340	all of the molecules that it needs to grow and it's thought that this process
5777220	5783940	you know occurred the autocatalytic set is kind of the precursor for the first cell
5784020	5791140	so it's kind of like a proto cell and it was thought to occur around hydrothermal vents which
5791140	5799060	are underwater volcanoes there's all this energy flowing up from the the the hot core running
5799060	5806180	through geochemical energy and there's these rocky pores in the rocks around hydrothermal vents which
5807300	5810340	provides something like a membrane like a lipid
5810980	5815220	membrane to hold the components in a Markov blanket so the the pores in the rocks
5815780	5821700	were the Markov blanket for the autocatalytic set and Eric Smith and Morowitz showed that
5822500	5830260	basically feeding off inorganic inputs like carbon molecules like not anything
5830260	5836900	not organic chemistry where it's like life but just like simple like carbon hydrogen and oxygen
5836900	5846420	feeding off those inputs basically the metabolic process it's called the reverse grab cycle so
5847860	5858820	that process allowed the first autocatalytic set to continuously self-amplify through this
5858820	5864820	through this process so if this process is allowed to continue further self-organization
5864820	5868660	may eventually lead to the emergence of an organic computer that can process integrate and
5868660	5876340	store information about the world so what dissipative adaptation is doing is uh as it's doing this
5876340	5881700	blind variation and selective retention process and it's finding more stable configurations
5882260	5888260	those more stable configurations are also predictive of the environment so this dissipative
5888260	5896580	adaptation process is this autocatalytic set modeling the surrounding energy landscape so
5896580	5902180	i'm arguing that this is where modeling begins it even begins before what we call life like
5902180	5908420	self replicating life and it's dissipative adaptation which is a process of modeling the
5908420	5917700	the energy in the environment the energy sources um so uh this isn't just one continuous process
5917700	5923300	there are these leaps that are phase transitions basically we've heard of phase transitions and
5924500	5928660	physics and chemistry courses where you have like
5931380	5938740	water being heated up and then transitioning into a gas or the reverse when a gas becomes frozen
5939380	5949700	uh you get a state of order that emerges um these transitions towards uh these configurations
5949700	5957060	that are good at extracting energy those uh have also been characterized as phase transitions
5957060	5961300	so eric smith who i mentioned before and Harold Morowitz they have this phase transition theory
5961300	5970660	of life which basically uh explains how um information gains control in these systems
5973140	5977140	and sarah walker and paul davies work on this basically show that through this process
5977780	5982420	the blind variation and selective retention information gets built up in this autocatalytic
5982420	5989700	set and at some point there's what they call algorithmic takeover uh or informational control
5989700	5996900	and the system becomes an agent that can start to steer and control itself uh in ways that wouldn't
5996900	6003220	be predicted by physics so a living system is very much like we didn't talk about dissipative
6003220	6009380	structures but like tornadoes warples those things emerge to dissipate an energy gradient
6011140	6018580	living things uh because of the process of metabolism we are this cycling system this
6018660	6027060	thermodynamic energetic loop um uh but uh what's it gonna say about that um
6030500	6036260	so yeah we are like the storm but we do have control over the storm we're a storm with control
6036260	6041140	so it doesn't really make sense going back to sam harris's quote that you are the storm you do
6041140	6047060	not control it it's literally the information that gets built up through evolution that allows
6047940	6054340	you know us being this dissipative structure like a storm to start controlling its own behavior
6057460	6066340	um so the last part is just an argument for that second question why should complexity increase
6067060	6072180	um we know that this evolutionary process where you build up this model
6072580	6078660	uh so we would think that this after these generations of evolution this organism is
6078660	6085460	going to be well adapted to its environment but we know that adaptation doesn't mean becoming
6085460	6092820	more complex always so sharks and crocodiles are cited as species that haven't evolved much at all
6093380	6101700	in many millions of years um cave fish actually evolved to become more simple so basically fish
6101700	6108980	with eyes got isolated in like an underground environment where there was no uh need for
6108980	6119700	sunlight and uh so basically um fish like processing light like eyes didn't have any
6119700	6127780	survival advantage so um basically fish lost their eyes uh over many generations of evolution
6127780	6136180	becoming simpler so if that's true why should evolution increase complexity um the answer to
6136180	6141780	that it comes from this understanding that evolutionary epistemology says that a species
6141780	6147460	adapting to a niche is like a scientific theory being tested for viability the species will evolve
6147460	6154100	not to become increasingly complex but to match the complexity of the environment a sort of simplest
6154100	6160020	solution to the thermodynamic problem of staying far from equilibrium so i'm signed famous we said
6160020	6166420	a theory should be as simple as possible but no simpler the same could be said about an organism
6166420	6174100	you want it to be as simple as possible while it accomplishes its task of extracting energy
6174100	6180500	it has to be complex enough to be able to extract energy in a competitive environment
6181220	6187700	but a bacterium doesn't have to do it doesn't need intelligence any extra information processing
6187700	6196820	higher level cognition would be energy wasted um that could be energy that allows it to stay
6196820	6203700	far from equilibrium for longer and replicate more so um it's not the case that everything
6203700	6210820	will evolve towards higher complexity uh but the reason that we do get increasingly complex
6210820	6217380	species over evolutionary time in a way that i'm saying is inevitable uh so there is a progressive
6217380	6224820	evolutionary process that leads to higher forms it has to do with uh niche emergence so so basically
6225620	6230740	a species will evolve to become as complex as its niche as its environmental niche
6231220	6240020	but there will be increasingly complex niches that emerge uh for reasons that will be explained
6240020	6247620	um but i will pause there uh before i get to that which will be what we end on
6250180	6255460	there are no other questions right now so if anyone does have questions how about they can
6255460	6262500	feel free to ask it during this last section give you a second to catch your breath i know it's been
6262500	6269140	a ton of information like my goal is that you know since this is being recorded it'll be something
6269140	6276660	that's up um hopefully i've cited enough literature that people can explore this stuff themselves
6276660	6282180	and see that like okay it's not this guy that's like uh coo claiming to have like a theory of
6282180	6290100	everything this isn't my theory it's a synthesis that's emerging and um uh really the story has
6290100	6298100	been there for quite some time and the cybernetics pioneers actually a lot of them were you could call
6298100	6303700	them like cosmic teleologists a lot of them did see this continual increase in complexity
6304500	6309940	of course there's nothing mystical about it or supernatural about it um it's a mechanistic
6309940	6317300	process that doesn't change the fact that nature seems to have these built-in goals that emerge from
6318260	6325060	the fundamental laws and constants the parameters the fine-tuning um but it's a completely natural
6325060	6332180	progressive teleological evolutionary process and so i'll just end you know this is just
6333300	6338020	finishing up it's along the same line so that's good questions can come after this
6338020	6347380	i know it's been quite a lot so i will just try to sum this up simply um so uh two important
6347380	6353700	principles from cybernetics these came from ross ashby who also created the principle of
6353700	6359300	self-organization which was really the first time people took self-organization seriously so
6360340	6364420	we think of complexity science as being the science of self-organization but it really
6364420	6370660	goes back to cybernetics um i think the term i think khan might have talked about it but it was
6371220	6377220	ross ashby who tried to you know give it a make it a a principle and a formalized concept
6378340	6384500	so there are these two concepts that really i think anybody interested in like carl firston's
6384500	6389860	basing brain hypothesis free energy principle should be aware of because all of the way he talks
6389860	6399060	about like evolution comes from this ashby's work um the good regulator theorem it was also
6399060	6403860	updated there there was the internal model principle which came like a decade later good
6403860	6409860	regulator theorem came these both these laws i think came in the 50s and the 40s or 50s and then
6409860	6414500	i think in the 70s the internal model principle was created but it basically says that any system
6414500	6420420	that regulates or controls another system must have a model of that system otherwise it can't
6420420	6426980	regulate it so it seems pretty obvious but this talk of models kind of starts here that that is
6426980	6435860	very familiar to like anyone interested in like the free energy principle so this this can be applied
6435860	6442660	to inanimate systems i mean controllers are like house like thermostats and stuff but ashby was
6442660	6447220	really interested in adaptive systems so he was thinking about evolution so applied to evolution
6447780	6454580	an organism must model its environment uh if it's going to extract free energy uh and an organism
6454580	6460340	is a model of its niche like a key is a model of the lock it opens so when we talk about these
6460340	6467700	models it can be kind of extract kind of abstract but i think this model like a key is a model of
6467700	6474820	the lock it opens really explains how an organism fits into a niche uh you could also say like a
6474820	6483620	hand fits into a glove but it really uh the organism is a model of its environment so
6483620	6489380	natural selection is essentially an information channel that through evolution is pumping in
6489380	6495060	information from the external world from the environment into the organism such that the
6495060	6502980	organism is encoding the structure of reality encoding the structure of the world and its design
6504180	6511780	include uh encodes information about the outside world so it's kind of a new way to think about
6511780	6519860	evolution is this process of basically the universe is modeling itself and waking up through this
6519940	6527860	process it's pretty interesting um kind of psychedelic so um the law recommends it variety
6528420	6535140	is just telling you about the sophistication of that model so how complex does the model have to be
6535140	6540900	for the organism to stay far from equilibrium um ross ashby's law says
6541860	6550260	so john noughton researcher at Cambridge uh kind of summed it up this way in colloquial terms
6550260	6555300	ashby's law has come to be understood as a simple proposition if the system is to be able to deal
6555300	6559460	successfully with the diversity of challenges that its environment produces then it needs to
6559460	6564500	have a repertoire of responses which is at least as nuanced as the problems thrown up by the
6564500	6570100	environment so a viable system is one that can handle the variability of its environment or as
6570100	6578260	ashby put it only variety can absorb variety so it's what we said before with evolutionary
6578260	6586500	epistemology an organism evolves to become as complex as its environmental niche requires
6587060	6595860	it has to specifically have enough behavioral responses which map on to internal states so
6595860	6605380	it has to have enough cognitive states to respond to the number of challenges that the environment
6605380	6614740	presents challenges um in its ability to extract energy and when when you get organisms and you get
6614740	6623380	other uh you get other agents other organisms then of course what the organism has to model
6623380	6628900	is much more complicated because it doesn't have to just model the energy source in its environment
6628900	6639220	like to get food it also has to model other modelers other cognitive agents um so yeah basically
6641380	6652820	any adaptive system has uh a behavioral repertoire and a repertoire of accessible mental states or
6652820	6658340	for things without brains computational states and the number of states that the organism can access
6659140	6667540	uh should match the number of challenges the number of states that could surprise the organism
6667540	6673700	by the environment um so a cat must have at least as many states as the ways the mouse can evade it
6673700	6678420	and the mouse has to have enough behavioral states to get away so they model each other
6679380	6686580	a swordsman like a fincer must have many blocks as his opponent has attacks and as we said
6687300	6693300	because behavioral responses map on to unique internal states the loss of an organism must have
6693300	6699140	as many accessible states as required by the complexity of the niche so we already said this
6699860	6704100	organism is some simplest solution to the thermodynamic problem of staying far from equilibrium
6704180	6711220	so a well-adapted species represents a biological solution to an existential thermodynamic
6711220	6716660	dilemma it's a sort of living evolving scientific theory about how to most efficiently extract the
6716660	6722500	free energy the lifeblood of existence out of a particular niche some niches present a changing
6722500	6726740	variety of challenges that must be adapted to you while others present hardly any at all
6726740	6734180	so almost done here I know it's a lot um hopefully this can kind of wrap up the ideas
6734180	6740100	and kind of show how they're all connected um but this is still on this question of how complex
6740820	6749780	is the universe uh how complex can it get so Olivia Judson wrote this uh
6751060	6755700	published this paper called the energy expansions of evolution it's really nice people should check it
6755700	6761700	out uh so she says the history of the earth life earth system can be divided into five energetic
6761700	6766500	epochs each featuring the evolution of life forms that can exploit a new source of energy these
6766500	6771940	sources are geochemical energy sunlight oxygen flesh and fire the first two are present at the
6771940	6777220	start but oxygen flesh and fire all consequences of evolutionary events and then she makes this
6777220	6785540	statement by the way red is quotes if people haven't uh figured that out so these are her words
6785540	6793220	I forgot to put quote marks um so no category of energy sources disappeared this has over time
6793220	6797620	resulted in an expanding realm of the sources of energy available to living organisms and a
6797620	6807460	con commitment uh increase in the diversity and complexity of ecosystems so here's the way to
6807460	6814580	think about it um so taking the thermodynamic perspective and looking at organisms as energy
6814580	6819700	flow channels uh we can think of each niche on earth as a sort of energy slot for a given
6819700	6824420	species and an evolving population of organisms efficiently searching the solution space will
6824420	6829380	eventually just by chance discover a solution to a thermodynamic problem that it didn't know
6829380	6834340	existed the discovery of a novel energy source or energy extraction technique is both how a new
6834340	6839540	niche and a new species come into existence so phylogenetic learning which we saw in that
6840260	6846740	chart will naturally lead to speciation because organisms will stumble upon new ways to exploit
6846740	6852580	thermodynamic niches that were previously inaccessible to life purely for design reasons
6852580	6859060	we're going to give examples on the next slide um so as the biosphere accumulates knowledge
6859060	6863940	through phylogenetic learning not only is the solution space corresponding to one kind of
6863940	6869620	thermodynamic problem being explored there's a growing problem space each with its own unique
6869620	6878740	solution space um so in an evolution so there's an evolutionary trajectory that's not determined
6878740	6884500	in the strict sense uh envisioned by Laplace where like there's no freedom in the future is
6884500	6891860	like set in stone but there is a sort of statistical determinism what i've been calling a non-equilibrium
6891860	6898580	statistical determinism that guarantees that basically the inevitability of this emergence
6898580	6905940	of a distribution of far from equilibrium attractors a varying varying degrees of complexity so each
6905940	6914260	species can be seen as a an attractor that's exploiting this niche and you get this uh basically
6914260	6923780	this diversity where you have uh organisms uh exploiting like the the energy niches that were
6923780	6929220	kind of the easy ones to exploit on earth like the geochemical free energy we mentioned with
6929220	6935300	the origin of life and then sunlight was a little bit of a more difficult challenge to
6935300	6943860	extract sunlight it took some time for evolution to be able to do that um so uh extracting energy
6943860	6949940	from the hydrothermal vents uh source of energy is really simple because the energy is already
6949940	6955060	like flowing through the system it doesn't have to do much work to extract sunlight you have you
6955060	6962500	know a moving sun it's a little bit more complicated but not nearly as complicated as organisms that
6962500	6970100	eat other organisms so heterotrophic organisms um because they will have to model not just like a
6970100	6975300	sun moving predictably through the air but have to model all these other agents many of which are
6975300	6984820	trying to eat them to kill you um so basically so answering this question why increasingly
6984820	6990740	intelligent species emerge we started off with reductive autotrophs those organisms around
6990740	6995300	hydrothermal vents they were a solution to the problem of how to extract free energy from geochemical
6995300	7002340	gradients um photosynthetic bacteria the ancestors of plants were the solution to extract of how to
7002340	7006740	extract all the solar energy that was flowing through the planetary system so that was a big
7007380	7013540	discovery made by life is that you can get energy directly from sunlight heterotrophic
7013540	7018020	organisms organisms that eat other organisms were the solution to the problem of how to
7018020	7023780	extract energy from life itself once life starts having to model life other agents with causal
7023780	7028820	power and adaptive behavior the computational task of extracting free energy gets increasingly
7028820	7034660	difficult as increasingly complex species arise so by virtue of having to model each other the
7034660	7041860	complexity of some species gets ratcheted up by what's known as an evolutionary arms race so the
7041860	7048580	lion is evolving you know well lions are producing offspring some of those lions will be better at
7048580	7055140	predicting the gazelle's movements the gazelle will also be creating offspring and some of those
7055140	7061860	will be better at predicting the lion's attack the ones that are better predicting are the ones that
7061860	7067700	get to uh stick around so you see how you have this ratcheting mechanism that ratchets that
7067700	7076020	ratchets its complexity there's actually a principle called the red queen principle
7077220	7085140	that says that for an organism to simply stay in the game of existence certain organisms
7085140	7090500	a certain species they will have to become increasingly complex and that comes from
7091460	7099380	uh alice in wonderland basically uh there's a scene with the red queen and alices they're
7099380	7104580	they're all running as fast as they can and alice is like you know i'm running fast as i i keep
7104580	7109220	running but i'm i'm going nowhere like so they're they're all running but they're they're not making
7109220	7114340	any distance they're staying in place and the queen says something like oh you see here for that
7115060	7125460	uh to go somewhere you'll have to run much faster than that um so the idea is that for a species
7126660	7131700	that has to deal with this complex environment just to stay where it is just to stay in the
7131700	7139860	game of existence it has to become increasingly complex it has to keep adapting so one thing
7139860	7145700	that i wanted to get into more but i'm not going to is this idea of empowerment it comes from the
7145700	7151060	computational neuroscience literature it's similar it comes from daniel pilani but it's very similar
7151060	7158980	to harvard's uh alex wissner vizner gross he has an idea called causal entropic forcing but
7158980	7167940	basically these people are arguing that um well vizner gross is arguing that a causal entropic force
7169940	7177140	means that like basically with like evolution you'll get a system systems that uh are trying to
7177140	7187140	maximize the number of states they can respond to so the maximize and the number of states they
7187140	7192980	can respond to is mirrored by their internal diversity so systems naturally try to increase
7192980	7201460	the number of states and it's this ability that allows for intelligence because if you have more
7201460	7208980	states going back to this law of requisite variety you can respond to more challenges so not every
7208980	7216260	species is increasing empowerment but you will get the emergence of increasing uh increasingly
7216260	7226180	complex uh species because uh each species uh serves as food for a potential new species um
7227140	7234100	you will get increasingly complex species that emerge over time and they will be increasingly
7234100	7241380	empowered meaning that they can respond to more environmental states and that they have more
7241380	7248660	accessible mental or cognitive states um i explained some of this in the last
7249380	7254420	slide but i'll just explain a little more so open-ended niche emergence why is the evolutionary
7254420	7261060	record shown a trend of the emergence of increasingly complex forms um because when all conceivable
7261060	7265540	niches on earth were filled that wasn't the end new species created new niches because the free
7265540	7272500	energy slot they provide is themselves their food so cybernetics guy he's kind of like the last
7273060	7279620	living cybernet assist kind of um i'm sure there are other people that call themselves that but
7279620	7286100	he's kind of kept that title even when it like wasn't trendy um he says is well documented by
7286100	7290660	evolutionary biologists that ecosystems tend to become more complex the number of different
7290660	7295140	species increases and the number of dependencies and other linkages linkages between species
7295140	7303300	increases he cites eo wilson who recently passed away um who did a lot of work that that kind of
7303300	7311060	inspired a lot of the concepts in the book um not just this niche emergence but also talking about
7311060	7317060	super organisms so collectives like ant colonies and self-organizing systems at all scales but he
7317060	7321860	said not only do ecosystems contain typically lots of niches that will eventually be filled
7321860	7328020	by new species but there is a self-reinforcing tendency to create new niches what does that mean
7328660	7335060	it means uh the biosphere uh certainly ecosystems are themselves autocatalytic sets
7336500	7342660	so sethloid he's talking about these chemical autocatalytic sets but it's i should have had
7342660	7348740	this on the earlier slide but it'll be a good way to kind of show the equivalence between ecosystems
7348980	7352980	sethloids as autocatalytic sets of reactions are powerful systems in addition to computing they
7352980	7357620	can produce a wide variety of chemical outputs in effect an autocatalytic set of reactions is
7357620	7362340	like a tiny computer controlled factory for producing chemicals some of these chemicals
7362340	7369460	are the constituents of life now steward coughman big you know one of the main names who's kind of
7369460	7376100	this whole talk he's kind of put these ideas out there uh since like the early 90s well actually
7376420	7381700	going back farther than that but he started writing books in the 90s and really gaining
7381700	7388260	exposure for the Santa Fe Institute uh he's written a recent paper well semi-recent um
7388820	7395140	about uh niche emergence as an autocatalytic process so ecosystems are autocatalytic
7395140	7402260	autocatalytically closed self-sustaining reaction networks so they're autopoietic agents that reliably
7402900	7408500	drive up biological diversity and complexity as they self-amplify and evolve so when you think
7408500	7413220	about it really all integrated networks of adaptive systems function as autocatalytic sets
7413220	7419060	there's been a lot of papers showing this economies in a sense are autocatalytic sets including the
7419060	7427860	social organisms we call societies or civilizations um so these networks are common because they
7427860	7432820	emerge spontaneously when many organisms repeatedly interact with one another and discover
7432820	7439380	synergistic collective configurations as nature often pressures them to do so we're at the end
7440420	7447940	almost uh we've explained why complexity increases uh evolution will not increase the complexity
7447940	7454100	of every species they will become adapted to their niche they will match the complexity of the niche
7454100	7461140	however because new niches are always emerging because species act as food for a potential new
7461140	7468980	species um because of that process you will get this increase uh you will get species that emerge
7468980	7475700	that have a higher number of a larger repertoire of mental and behavioral states so the law of
7475700	7482660	requisite variety really explains why more complex environments create more complex niches and this
7482660	7492420	is open-ended there's really no uh limit to how far this process can go especially since humans
7493060	7498900	who are the pinnacle of this process we're not you know a lot of people have been against these
7498900	7503780	kinds of views because it seems like it's saying that humans are superior we're superior maybe
7503780	7509540	computationally but not superior in any other sense we're actually part of the biosphere
7509540	7515700	which is this integrated interconnected system so it's really you know it doesn't make sense to
7515700	7521060	think of us as like superior to nature because the whole biosphere is an organism that we're just
7521060	7527140	sort of an organ for uh we're basically the nervous system of the planet the cybernetic
7528020	7532260	global system that people have called Gaia some people don't like that name I think it's a perfectly
7532260	7543700	good name but um that's why uh complexity gets ratcheted up but the final um uh I guess uh part
7543700	7550820	of of this complexity increased story is that not only do you get increasingly complex species uh
7550820	7559860	those species will interact naturally to form higher level uh adaptive systems which are
7559940	7567540	collectives so um I call this the principle of recursive self-organization based on Ashby's
7567540	7573620	principle of self-organization what I'm arguing is that when you have a biosphere with these
7573620	7578420	agents and you have some are simple and some are complex naturally those agents will interact
7579060	7586580	when they interact they will uh in many cases discover synergistic collective configurations
7586580	7592260	so configurations that make it easier for each agent to extract the energy they need to stay
7592260	7599060	far from equilibrium so why do interacting agents link up to form stable holes for the
7599060	7602820	exact same reason that molecules with the right chemical diversity will form stable
7602820	7607940	autocatalytic reaction sets when pushed by a flow of energy working collectively allows the whole
7607940	7614340	system to extract more free energy with less work we can that's the whole point of synergy
7614340	7619940	is that working together makes your workload easier because there's a distribution of labor
7621380	7628180	and it's it's really nice um that you know this uh distribution of species with some
7628180	7634580	simple and some complex uh that's really what you need to create this like uh cybernetic
7634580	7642260	adaptive system at the level of a planet because a system uh needs diversity among its components
7642260	7647460	in structure and function for there to be this distribution of labor labor which makes it this
7648900	7659700	collective whole this this synergistic holistic unit um so it's actually good that evolution
7659700	7666580	in adaptation isn't increasing this the complexity of each species like each species isn't becoming
7666580	7671380	intelligent like roaches aren't becoming like more and more intelligent over time with no limit
7672420	7678900	the biosphere wouldn't be stable if that were the case uh it's really uh ecosystems need this
7678900	7685540	diversity among components just as a car with made of all engines isn't going to be functional
7685540	7692420	or our organism made of all brains you need a variety of parts some simple some complex because
7692420	7697860	they all do different functions um so nature promotes cooperation collaboration and synergy
7697860	7704500	because it is thermodynamically beneficial for all parties um synergistic collective configurations
7704500	7709540	will eventually be discovered by many component systems that are exploring various states or
7709540	7715540	configurations through the blind variation and selective retention mechanism mentioned organisms
7715540	7720740	only compete until they finally figure out what that working together makes everyone's task easier
7721380	7727060	and that goes for humans too so it's kind of a moral lesson for everybody the nations have to
7727060	7734420	work together we shouldn't um get rid of the nations there shouldn't just be this evolution
7734420	7741460	into this like global government because the nations are actually uh provide this diversity
7741460	7748020	that we're saying is important uh because you need this uh diversity of component parts to create
7748020	7753460	a division of labor so there's strength in diversity this is different than the evolutionary
7753460	7758180	picture of survival of the fittest whereas there's just like this idea that the stronger the most
7758180	7763060	intelligent survive this is saying that that's not true it's the most adaptive that survive has
7763060	7768500	nothing to do with strength or intelligence sloths have been around for many millions of years despite
7769140	7776180	being sloths being slow uh because they exploit uh source of free energy that's not being exploited
7776260	7785860	by another uh species so um going back to this kind of global message you want nations to retain
7785860	7795140	their identities but you also want them at the same time to come together and to work synergistically
7795140	7803300	so you basically want something like a global system but this there has to be the optimal
7803300	7811300	balance between centralization and decentralization um neither approach will be good on its own
7811300	7819460	there needs to be this balance so um as long as the biosphere is creating a growing variety of
7819460	7823220	complex adaptive systems some of those will interact to produce higher level complex adaptive
7823220	7829540	systems which will come together to form even larger ones this process continues uh at higher
7829540	7837140	scales so i didn't go into this left out a kind of a neat picture that shows a brain and then the
7837140	7844500	planet and it's like information networks but uh i do i i hope that you know talk about gaya and
7844500	7850420	global brain will become uh will be taken as seriously as it should be uh they really only
7850420	7855540	weren't taken seriously because there were mystical notions associated with this word gaya
7855540	7861940	which wasn't even james uh love locks uh fault he act the name gaya came from his neighbor
7862660	7869940	who is actually the author of lord of the flies boim golden so blame him for the for the flowery
7870580	7877940	metaphor with gaya um but yeah the the biosphere is a cybernetic organism and we are forming
7877940	7884500	something like the global brain and a self replicating biosphere uh is essentially
7885140	7891540	the next step and when we are trying to care for planets like mars that can be seen as the
7891540	7900420	biosphere replicating uh for humans to at this point in our stage of development we would have
7900420	7906180	to kind of convert mars to like a something like a biosphere to have like oxygen and so
7906180	7911380	you can see how it's replication with variation you get the same sort of thing but because it's
7911380	7916020	a different planet there's going to be a variation it's not going to be exactly the same but that's
7916020	7920980	how the evolutionary process continues i should show this earlier this is just showing how like
7921700	7926900	eukaryotic single celled organisms like amoebas will come together to form communities like a
7926900	7934820	slime mold uh these multi cellular organisms come together to form colonies you see this
7935620	7940900	ant colony ants actually really do form a superorganism you can see here they actually
7940900	7947940	build a bridge out of their bodies so that some ants can like climb across that bridge so it really
7947940	7954740	makes sense to call it a superorganism or at least like a super adaptive system or like a meta
7955700	7962100	meta system um because without it we can't make sense of this collective behavior that's functional
7962980	7969700	of course human civilization the again seed is hierarchy now it makes more sense we see that
7969700	7975300	these evolutionary transitions oh yeah these are called evolutionary transitions sometimes i use the
7975300	7982340	name meta system transition because um if we were talking about the brain i would also talk about
7982420	7989540	like the emergence of a prefrontal cortex which is like a high level controller um that's also
7989540	7995540	like a meta system transition so meta system transitions are a little extend this where it's
7995540	8001860	not talking necessarily about evolutionary transitions but these other transitions where
8002500	8013140	systems start to model themselves um so here we see uh how evolution has created these
8013780	8021300	different memory systems these knowledge repositories so it's that process of recursive
8021300	8027700	self-organization that creates new memory systems when you get go from single cell life to multi
8027780	8035380	cellular life to life with brains uh it's uh these are revolutions in information storage
8035380	8041140	machinery so you can see how the information in the biosphere gets accumulated through an
8041140	8051380	evolutionary process um these are the final points yeah so knowledge is powers not just
8051380	8055780	the hollow buzz phrase of the digital age it's true in the most fundamental way uncertainty
8056180	8061060	information is life's first and last weapon in ongoing war with disorder without knowledge
8061060	8066020	life cannot exist for more than a moment much less colonize the galaxy and beyond this suggests
8066020	8069620	it's sitting out in the path toward cosmic superiority it's not a choice that intelligent
8069620	8074580	agents like homo sapiens make upon careful reflection nor is it just some quirky ambition
8074580	8080420	we somewhat answered by chance this is the main point humanities collective desire to transcend
8080420	8086740	mortality and expand outward into space so apparent from our current scientific and technological
8086740	8092980	endeavors space x uh this doesn't emerge as an accident this is inevitable consequence of the
8092980	8098980	fact that continual knowledge acquisition is a fundamental biological imperative if life wants
8098980	8104980	to persist and stay far from equilibrium at some point it has to get off the planet because the sun
8105700	8113300	is uh going to die and uh it's these sorts of problems these existential problems which
8113300	8119620	create progress because it's our awareness of this problem which uh forces us to
8121700	8127540	search the configuration space for the solutions that solve the problem so it's natural selection
8127540	8131380	points information from the inanimate world into life nature begins modeling itself encoding
8131380	8136900	its own structure and the universe begins to wake up we are the cosmos come alive not metaphorically
8136900	8144180	but literally this is Ray Kurzweil's uh image from his book this hilarity is near you can see that
8144740	8151220	he sees this he calls this the the destiny of of life in the universe and he's not shy about
8151220	8157540	using that word um again it's not determined in the strict sense of replace this uh kind of a
8157540	8164100	statistical determinism that creates these uh series of attractors and um
8165860	8171940	you've seen famous people uh so you know some people see that idea and they'll have been
8171940	8176260	reading brian green and listening to all these reductionists and think that's not a scientific
8176260	8183620	view well uh that's not true and um i hope to see more of these people speaking out about it so
8183620	8188660	Christoph Koch in confessions of a romantic reductionist says the rise of sentient life
8188660	8194180	within times wide circuit was inevitable teal hard day shard in we really came up with this don't
8194180	8198660	have time to talk about him french philosopher in jezzouette you should look into is correct in his
8198660	8203220	view that the islands within the universe if not the whole cosmos are evolving toward ever
8203220	8209380	greater complexity and self-knowledge to be clear he's not saying that earth had to bear life that
8209380	8215620	you know primates had to walk to the african godslands but he says i do believe that the
8215620	8220100	laws of physics overwhelmingly favored the emergence of consciousness the universe is a
8220100	8226900	work in progress such a belief evokes jeri Jeremy at an island for many biologists and
8226900	8233780	philosophers but the evidence from cosmology biology and history is compelling so there's
8233780	8241140	some uh advanced blurbs for this book uh if you want to pre-order it um it comes out in june
8242020	8247460	but every order that i get from now until then will count towards my first week sales total
8247460	8252740	so that will help me get on best sellers list if you want to pre-order it now and you email me um
8252740	8259140	i will send you a copy soon of this novel i also wrote called road to omega i was pretty busy in the
8259140	8266740	last five years yeah i went into a cave for like four or five years but this uh is a vehicle for
8266740	8272500	the science and philosophy in the book kind of like an anti-iron rand at the shrug maybe the
8272500	8278500	opposite philosophy um and the road to omega sub-stack kind of turns this philosophy into
8278500	8286180	kind of an effort to um save the world with uh science epistemology and blockchain technology
8286900	8292020	uh blockchains are part of this self-organization process and that's the longest talk i've ever
8292020	8297060	given that's the longest i've ever talked at one time probably my wife will probably say
8297060	8303700	that's not true but i'm tired so let's uh open it up to questions and thank you for your immense
8303700	8312260	patience it's awesome to hear and think about it so there are two questions in the chat first is
8312340	8321540	from dean dean asks how would we explain caring through a lens of free will or no free will would
8321540	8326420	free will deniers say there's no caring when it appears that agents can or do fully care
8328340	8335860	yeah so great question um unfortunately i don't have much to say without saying the things that
8335860	8341380	i was going to bring up in the next talk really explaining what free will is i guess i should
8341380	8347540	just say right now uh kind of a brief explanation of what i mean by free will so i hope i've made
8347540	8356180	the argument that agency emerges uh in adaptive systems that start off as biological organisms
8356900	8362740	and um to the person that's self-driving car thing i uh just to mention that real quick
8362740	8369300	i don't think they're agents but i do think uh it's possible to create systems with agency
8370260	8378740	for reasons that i haven't gone into um it seems important that the systems have a certain type
8378740	8385140	of architecture so not like a standard computer as a von Neumann architecture and it's not
8385700	8391860	distributed and integrated in the way the brain is so it's not integrating much information so
8391940	8400340	these systems won't have causal power they won't be agents um so uh neuromorphic hardware has been
8401460	8407380	a lot of people think that's going to allow machines that can think and perhaps even be conscious
8407380	8412500	um i think maybe that's the way to go uh it's probably a lot more complicated than that that's
8412500	8419300	a step in the right direction so agency is real it's uh due to information gaining causal power
8419300	8428580	in a system and starts uh it starts steering the system so you'll see like a bacterium performing
8428580	8434740	chemotaxis but does it make sense to say that the bacterium has free will when it's going this way
8434740	8439780	and that just because it's not predictable in the way an inanimate system is so i would say that
8439780	8446260	they have agency but they don't have free will what uh free will is and it's not my idea other
8446260	8451540	people have kind of been talking in this way kevin michael uh has a book neurogeneticist uh
8452180	8457940	he's coming out with a book called agents which is all about agency and free will but um the idea is
8457940	8470340	that we are agents with causal power but um we're sort of uh where um our responses like
8470340	8479620	are basically uh programmed responses uh that are responses that occur um automatically uh that
8479620	8484820	are informed by this uh information that's been built up through evolution and adaptive learning
8485380	8490100	so a lot of the time we go through the day and we're not really thinking about things like
8490100	8495940	driving or like waking up and like you know going to the fridge we're not putting conscious thought
8495940	8502740	into that so that wouldn't seem to be free will uh to me you're you're kind of acting on autopilot
8502740	8508660	so what free will is is uh a higher level of control that emerges with something like a
8508660	8516500	prefrontal cortex in a global workspace basically free will allow uh a prefrontal cortex allows an
8516500	8526580	agent to override its uh instinctive and automatic behaviors um and so free will is something that uh
8527380	8533380	that we have but only if we're exercising this higher level of control it's associated with
8533380	8541860	cognitive control or executive control effortful control and basically um if you have a healthy
8541940	8549140	functioning prefrontal cortex uh you're going to basically the conscious mind is monitoring
8550340	8557620	consciousness is a monitor uh so it's it's monitoring uh your behaviors and if it uh
8558260	8562660	detects that there's suboptimal behavior for whatever reason like it's just automatic kind of
8562660	8569060	instinctual let's say someone says something that makes us angry and we respond immediately
8569060	8575700	with like pushing them or something uh that's not a wise move and that maybe may happen when we're
8575700	8584020	fearful because of the amygdala response and we just have this automatic behavior um but uh free
8584020	8592340	will would be when uh the conscious mind overrides that process and uh labette actually the free will
8592340	8599060	studies that everybody cites as saying that we don't have free will he actually never said that
8599060	8604900	he said free will is in this veto power like maybe some of our voluntary movements occur without
8604900	8612500	conscious thought but it's our ability to override those movements uh that is the source of free will
8613780	8617460	but there was more problems with that actually um the studies have
8618420	8622500	coped it a study showing that uh basically um
8624740	8632100	that free will um uh readiness potential which is like a spike in electrical activity that occurs
8632100	8637380	before you do this voluntary movement this movement we think is voluntary and everyone thought that
8637380	8641620	this meant that you're not really making a conscious decision that you could see this
8641620	8647220	spike in brain activity earlier than the person thought they made the voluntary voluntary decision
8648260	8652980	but a new study has shown that that's only the case when we're making like arbitrary decisions
8652980	8657780	and when they had people making a decision about when what went to donate like a large
8657780	8663860	amount of money to a charity you actually saw this readiness potential disappear and so it seems
8663860	8670100	like deliberate thinking which is still this like prefrontal cortex and there's this distinction
8670100	8675460	between access access consciousness and phenomenal consciousness that i didn't go into that i would
8675460	8681780	in the next talk that adam saffron and integrated world modern theory really gets at but the idea
8681780	8688580	is that the prefrontal cortex does allow us to override automatic behaviors and that is a sort
8688580	8696740	of freedom that we have and we also lose it uh in case of schizophrenia you see impaired uh
8696740	8702260	prefrontal cortex activity and drug addicts you see impaired activity um in drug drug addicts
8702260	8709140	you see they do repetitive behavior even when they know that it's uh not beneficial to them
8709140	8714180	they will still engage in that so they're kind of stuck in this loop for this unhealthy attractor
8715220	8721540	with schizophrenia there's patients that report being pushed around by forces that are beyond
8721540	8729460	their control uh i think that's because when the prefrontal cortex is uh basically deactivated um
8730420	8736980	people lose this sense this ability to override their automatic behaviors and i think that's what
8736980	8742180	those people are experiencing is sort of loss of this higher level agency that we've called free will
8744180	8750420	another interesting just the final interesting thing to mention about that is a cotard's syndrome
8750420	8755300	a cotard's delusion is this delusion where people think they're dead they think they're
8756100	8760340	like ghost or just not alive it's really weird a lot of people die from starvation
8760340	8762980	because they think they don't have to eat because they think they're already dead
8764020	8770100	you actually see from neuroimaging studies they've showed uh like impaired activity in the
8770100	8777620	prefrontal cortex so maybe these people who think they're dead have lost this high level agency and
8777620	8787060	they feel like they're ghosts or something um as far as caring uh so um caring is a part of like
8787780	8793460	emerged through evolution because you do have this benefit to cooperating with each other
8793460	8797220	this self-organization process that we talked about that happens naturally because
8797860	8802740	basically you find that when you work together you minimize conflicts and um
8802900	8813220	uh align it you align interest and so caring altruism empathy all of those things are as natural
8814100	8822180	uh and as Darwinian as anything else but you have to add on to evolutionary theory all of this
8822180	8828500	stuff about self-organization and cooperative evolution um as far as he said he said something
8828500	8836900	about why people uh who uh don't believe in free will I forget the exact point about the caring
8836900	8843060	what was that um when when it appears that agents can or do fully care
8845140	8851300	but sorry what was uh what was the first part of it um how would you explain caring through lens of
8851300	8856180	free will or no free will would free will deniers say there is no caring when it appears that
8856180	8864500	agents can or do fully care yeah no it's it it flies in the face of like uh our our everyday
8864500	8873540	experience so like yeah um I the the the amount of contradictions and like logic that doesn't
8873540	8880340	make sense when you go down that path of there being no free will or agency um you just you just
8880420	8887060	get into absurd territory it's I think when we look back it's going to look quaint that for so
8887060	8892340	long that we thought that everything was determined in a strict sense and it's really a big issue
8892340	8895780	because these people who believe that if they believe it if they take it to heart
8897540	8902020	they're experiencing cognitive dissonance at every moment you know and the people who
8902660	8908660	argue against agency they talk about religious people having to compartmentalize to deal with
8908660	8913940	you know the the real world but anybody who believes that we don't have agency has to compartmentalize
8913940	8922900	in the same way uh funny little conversation between Sam Harris and his wife um uh Annika Harris
8922900	8929300	who wrote a book called conscious that is a great accessible book but it leaves out like everything
8929300	8935540	that I've discussed and that I would discuss about like the Bayesian brain hypothesis uh global
8935540	8941300	workspace theory doesn't really go into integrate information theory in any depth so like all of
8941300	8947620	the things that they're missing that do explain a lot of this stuff uh can be found in like modern
8947620	8953460	neuroscience so we are making a lot of progress towards you know understanding the hard problem
8953460	8958740	of consciousness so subjective experience but also a free will and agency but it's funny because
8958740	8965060	they're having this conversation in the podcast and they're discussing whether since a belief in
8965060	8971940	no free will as mentioned that New York Times article I think 2011 showed that they have less
8971940	8976900	moral behavior and it can you know cause depression they're discussing whether they should tell their
8976900	8981300	daughter about free will or not that that she doesn't have any free will the discussion is like
8981300	8987620	should we tell our daughter that she doesn't have free will but the actual discussion implies that
8987620	8991460	they believe that they have some choice whether to tell her or not they're having a discussion
8991460	8996340	about whether they should do this or not so there's a contradiction in their conversation
8997060	9001620	that contradicts what they believe what's interesting is that if they do tell her that
9001620	9007060	she has no free will and she believes it she's actually gonna have negative mental effects
9007060	9013460	like it will ha you know be harmful um assuming that she really believes it I don't know if it has
9013460	9021700	that in in everyone but you do see studies that show that um so if we do have free will it's a very
9022420	9030020	bad thing to be telling people um and the last thing I'll say about that is well it's it's
9030020	9036260	interesting because if she's familiar with epistemology and they tell her that she doesn't have free will
9036260	9041780	but she goes okay that's based on a model that has uncertainty and that model may be disproved
9042580	9047140	then she might not have the negative effects of free will so I think
9047140	9052180	everyone should practice being a good Bayesian and understand that our models our theories even
9052180	9058180	the one that I just talked about um will have errors and will be shown to be wrong and if
9058180	9064660	reductionists do that they won't call free will belief and free will like comparing them to horoscopes
9064660	9070100	which is just I think a horrible statement and kind of funny that physicists don't like it
9070100	9075460	when like neuroscientists start and biologists start like talking about physics it's kind of
9075460	9080740	strange that physicists are are so sure that we don't have free will when they're not familiar
9080740	9089220	at all with the neuroscience behind agency and free will so would you like me to just
9089220	9095540	read a comment in the chat otherwise I think we can kind of come to a close um if there's anything
9095540	9102100	yeah I can do one more question yeah well uh Marco and Dave and others thanks a lot for the great
9102660	9108260	comments and commentary in the chat I hope that Bobby I hope you check the live chat replay
9109700	9116980	and uh Sean O'Connor wrote thanks for the good and informative talk Dr Azarian mentioned the idea
9116980	9121780	of evolutionary arms race I was hoping to recommend that he consider if he hasn't
9122340	9129300	how an introspect specific evolutionary arms race may relate I'm not familiar with the introspect
9129300	9138820	specific so uh perhaps like a game theory red queen not between uh two species but within one
9140340	9147940	species yes so you have an evolutionary arms race there too yeah certainly because you're
9148020	9155700	competing with other organisms um and uh uh John Maynard Smith who I mentioned earlier
9156580	9163780	talking about like this causal power of information biology he uh was the person to bring
9163780	9171460	von Neumann's game theory to biological evolution so he did all he basically showed that there is
9171460	9178020	this you know game theory sort of process being played out I think he his examples use different
9178020	9186100	species but I think within species um you would see the sorts same sort of thing of course if it's
9186100	9192740	not humans you know if you have other species people are competing organisms are competing
9192740	9197460	you will get increased complexity but there are limits so just because there's these evolutionary
9197460	9205220	arm races uh within and between species there will still be a limit because uh they have to model
9205220	9212660	the environment and just modeling all these unnecessary variables uh is is wasteful so um
9213220	9220980	it will ratchet up complexity in species but um I think at least with the planet earth and our
9220980	9232020	biosphere that uh that humans are this sort of leading envelope uh of complexity and um so it
9232020	9238180	really just is open-ended with the most complex species so the most complex species is the one
9238180	9245300	that will evolve toward higher complexity and uh really there might be a limit there there are
9245300	9250420	reasons to think there are limits to how far human biological intelligence can emerge there's
9250500	9255060	I mean can evolve towards there's something called a sephalization limit which is like
9255060	9260980	how big our brain can get because of reasons like having to do with like the skull and um
9261620	9269140	so but what's interesting is part of this process this evolutionary process is as popper and
9269940	9274660	newer people like Dennett have mentioned continues with science and culture and technology
9275220	9282020	so humans really have open-ended complexity because we're uh we're augmenting ourselves
9282020	9288820	with technology so while biology biological complexity may have limits there's no limits
9289540	9297060	once we start merging with our technology and we shouldn't see technology as separate from life
9297780	9302660	it's an extension of biology so the extended phenotype Richard Balkans explains like beaver
9302660	9308500	dams considers like the dam that the beaver instinctually builds as part of the whole phenotype
9308500	9313220	so the ecosystem the organism there's really no clear division between the organism and the
9313220	9318500	ecosystem and David Chalmers has the extended mind hypothesis which says that our phones our
9318500	9326100	extensions of our minds and um all of our devices are and for that reason we need to be worried
9326180	9332980	about privacy but we also need to not be scared of technology we just need to use technology to
9332980	9340500	become more human so we're not transcending like humanity and biology uh technology will
9340500	9349220	allow us to become hyper biological very interesting note perhaps to close it on
9349780	9357460	anytime you want the dot too we can make it happen it can be any format we can invite anyone else on
9358500	9367060	um really awesome and interesting to think about do you want any last words um if if I come back
9367060	9370980	to talk about free-wown agency it'd be great to have like Kevin Mitchell or um maybe Eric
9370980	9375860	Well who's done a lot of work on a top-down causation and causal emergence that was really
9375860	9383620	influenced uh influential in the book um thank if you know people you can um twitter tag them or
9383620	9391380	email us and uh email them and cc us or just contact us and we'll do that on our side thanks
9391380	9395300	been super fun thanks daniel really appreciate it really appreciate you reading a draft of the
9395300	9400740	manuscript just like in a few days to give me some feedback that actually helps clear up
9400740	9406820	little mistakes in the book um I heard you mentioned marco thanks uh to marco and anybody
9406820	9412340	else who's uh been watching and chiming in with questions really appreciate it sorry for the
9412340	9422340	information overload maybe watch this again maybe micro does or um maybe some legal stuff delta eight
9422340	9426900	water micro does water stay hydrated people who are it's legal keep
