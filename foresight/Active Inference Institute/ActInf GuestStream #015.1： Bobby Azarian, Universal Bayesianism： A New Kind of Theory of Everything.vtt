WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.320
All right, thanks Daniel for having me, everyone at the Active Inference Lab, sorry for cancelling

00:06.320 --> 00:07.320
twice.

00:07.320 --> 00:14.240
Life's been kind of crazy with finishing this book that this talk will be about and having

00:14.240 --> 00:20.760
a kid I'm six months old and I got sick like a week ago, like right, leading up to like,

00:20.760 --> 00:23.240
you know, didn't want to cancel a third time and look crazy.

00:23.240 --> 00:29.760
So this is a very rushed presentation, it'll be better if it's more like a conversation

00:29.760 --> 00:34.400
since I haven't even gone through the slides myself once.

00:34.400 --> 00:38.840
And it's going to get into a lot of things like immediately like open up bags of worms,

00:38.840 --> 00:46.680
like there's just philosophical issues, things that people won't agree about like immediately.

00:46.680 --> 00:53.680
But yeah, so this is just going to be like a small introduction to the thesis in the

00:53.680 --> 00:54.680
book.

00:54.680 --> 00:59.760
And yeah, I'll explain more, I guess, after I begin.

00:59.760 --> 01:07.480
So yeah, it's called this the integrated evolutionary synthesis compared to like the modern synthesis

01:07.480 --> 01:10.240
or even the extended evolutionary synthesis.

01:10.240 --> 01:20.520
This is integrated because it kind of reconceptualizes evolution, biology and evolution in terms

01:20.520 --> 01:25.080
of thermodynamics and information theory or energy flows.

01:25.080 --> 01:29.880
Energy and information flows takes from cybernetics.

01:29.880 --> 01:36.120
So yeah, it's a non reductive theory of everything that includes emergent phenomena like life,

01:36.120 --> 01:38.640
mind and civilization.

01:38.640 --> 01:42.720
I say that because most theories of everything we're used to are fundamental physics theories

01:42.720 --> 01:46.520
that don't have anything to say about life and consciousness.

01:46.520 --> 01:49.480
They ignore them.

01:49.480 --> 01:54.280
And I don't think those should be called theories of everything because theories of everything

01:54.280 --> 01:57.680
should be an explanation for everything.

01:57.680 --> 02:03.120
And if you leave the things that we care about most out, then it's not much of a theory of

02:03.120 --> 02:04.120
everything.

02:04.120 --> 02:11.040
So this is the book I've spent the last two to three years writing obsessively.

02:11.040 --> 02:13.820
And it's available for pre-order now.

02:13.820 --> 02:19.380
So if you want to check that out, you can find it with a Google search.

02:19.380 --> 02:22.100
Here's the table of contents.

02:22.100 --> 02:25.060
So the book is broken into three sections.

02:25.060 --> 02:31.180
Part one talks about the origins of life and part two about evolution while part three

02:31.180 --> 02:38.220
focuses on consciousness and free will and the fate of life in the universe.

02:38.220 --> 02:47.700
So these really big questions that we're going to focus on part two and give a pretty superficial

02:47.700 --> 02:50.580
overview of part two.

02:50.580 --> 02:57.820
But you can feel free to ask me any questions about any of the other topics that are related.

02:57.820 --> 03:04.620
And I'll try to see what I can answer without going into all of the information that I would

03:04.620 --> 03:06.820
need to explain those things.

03:06.820 --> 03:14.020
So Thomas Huxley, known as Darwin's bulldog, because he was such a strong advocate for

03:14.020 --> 03:18.460
Darwin's theory, said that the question of questions for mankind, the problem which underlies

03:18.460 --> 03:22.860
all others, is more deeply interesting than any other, is the ascertainment and of the

03:22.860 --> 03:29.180
place which man occupies in nature and of his relations to the universe of things.

03:29.180 --> 03:33.420
So where do we fit into the grand cosmic scheme?

03:33.420 --> 03:42.220
So scientists in the 20th century and I would even say now believe that we are an accident.

03:42.220 --> 03:52.740
So Jacques Manot, a French biochemist who won the Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine,

03:52.740 --> 03:56.420
wrote a book called Chance and the Sesty, which was really influential.

03:56.420 --> 04:01.540
And he was just as reductionist as you can get, man at last knows that he is alone in

04:01.540 --> 04:08.260
the unfeeling immensity of the universe out of which he emerged only by chance, neither.

04:08.260 --> 04:12.540
So some of the words are covered by Daniel.

04:12.540 --> 04:17.660
So neither is his destiny spelled out nor his duty have been written down.

04:17.660 --> 04:19.980
I think there's something wrong with that quote.

04:19.980 --> 04:23.540
But so if there are times where I'm trying to read something where the picture's over,

04:23.540 --> 04:25.540
I might have to skip.

04:25.540 --> 04:29.460
You can move that because it looks different on my side.

04:29.460 --> 04:30.460
It looks fine.

04:30.460 --> 04:31.460
Perfect.

04:32.380 --> 04:33.380
Yeah.

04:33.380 --> 04:36.100
Neither his destiny nor his duty have been written down.

04:36.100 --> 04:43.260
So that was kind of based on this old idea that the emergence of life was a product

04:43.260 --> 04:45.140
of chance assembly.

04:45.140 --> 04:52.220
So like this just statistical fluctuation that brought together all the molecules needed

04:52.220 --> 04:54.380
to create the first cell.

04:54.380 --> 04:57.380
We now know that that's probably not what happened.

04:57.380 --> 05:00.180
It's this gradual process of self-organization.

05:00.180 --> 05:07.100
Jeremy England has been in the media a lot about his theory of dissipative adaptation.

05:07.100 --> 05:15.380
So let's see.

05:15.380 --> 05:19.220
So we will see this is kind of like a different point of view.

05:19.220 --> 05:22.940
Not everybody was convinced by Amano.

05:22.940 --> 05:26.860
Carl Sagan said the origin of life must be a highly probable affair as soon as conditions

05:26.860 --> 05:29.820
permit, up it pops.

05:29.820 --> 05:37.420
So this is an important question, whether life was improbable or inevitable.

05:37.420 --> 05:42.380
So if life is highly improbable, we're likely to be alone in the universe, but if the emergence

05:42.380 --> 05:48.100
of life is inevitable, given a certain set of common physical conditions, then it's

05:48.100 --> 05:55.100
likely that we have life at least on planets that are sufficiently Earth-like, specifically

05:55.100 --> 06:03.780
have geochemistry like the Earths have a star, some like the Earths, because that's

06:03.780 --> 06:07.540
what provides the energy that pushes it far from equilibrium.

06:07.540 --> 06:12.620
So we're going to get into all that stuff pretty soon.

06:12.620 --> 06:18.940
Christian Dedeau, this quote is kind of a response to Stephen Jay Gould, who just really

06:18.940 --> 06:27.940
emphasized, to both Amano and Stephen Jay Gould, the importance of chance in nature

06:27.940 --> 06:35.940
and that everything is basically a contingency that came from a chance process, where Dedeau

06:35.940 --> 06:43.260
says that you can have this inevitability that some philosophers would see as teleology,

06:43.260 --> 06:51.140
but it doesn't mean that this inevitable progress is being driven by a supernatural force.

06:51.140 --> 06:55.820
He explains that the natural constraints within which chance operates are such that evolution

06:55.820 --> 07:00.460
in the direction of increasing complexity was virtually bound to take place if given

07:00.460 --> 07:05.180
the opportunity, chance does not exclude inevitability.

07:05.180 --> 07:13.060
So he was also a Nobel Prize winning biologist, the same category as Amano, but had the complete

07:13.060 --> 07:15.580
opposite opinion.

07:15.580 --> 07:22.580
And we can talk about that too, basically, when systems are open systems and they're

07:22.580 --> 07:31.020
pushed far from equilibrium by a flow of energy, you basically get something like a statistical

07:31.020 --> 07:38.020
bias away from what we would expect with isolated systems, closed systems that aren't open to

07:38.020 --> 07:44.540
energy will relax the thermodynamic equilibrium, and when a system is being pushed far from

07:44.540 --> 07:53.420
equilibrium, it will naturally organize because organization happens under the flow of energy

07:53.420 --> 07:57.340
and we're going to see exactly why it's a Darwinian process.

07:57.340 --> 08:05.700
But basically, you get inevitability if you have the right ingredients.

08:05.700 --> 08:14.260
So we'll talk about, to kind of frame this, we already kind of mentioned those two worldviews.

08:14.260 --> 08:20.700
So the first worldview would be the reductionist worldview, and I should be clear that productionism

08:20.700 --> 08:29.300
is also, it's a method and an ideology and we shouldn't confuse those two things.

08:29.300 --> 08:34.260
And Daniel, I guess just so I'm, you know, know where I'm at maybe when you, when I've

08:34.340 --> 08:36.780
gone 30 minutes, you can let me know.

08:36.780 --> 08:38.780
Okay, I'll hoot.

08:38.780 --> 08:40.780
Okay, great.

08:40.780 --> 08:47.060
So reductionism, the method basically says that reality can be understood by breaking

08:47.060 --> 08:52.940
down all physical phenomena into their simplest parts so that we may observe the basic behavior

08:52.940 --> 08:56.100
of the fundamental constituents of nature.

08:56.100 --> 09:05.860
So I'm just going to plug in this charger, I might need to do that in a bit, but basically

09:05.860 --> 09:08.380
the method is how science works.

09:08.380 --> 09:13.100
If we want to understand emergence, we also have to understand how the components that

09:13.100 --> 09:15.780
systems are made of work in isolation.

09:15.780 --> 09:22.340
So it's an essential part of the story, but it's not the whole part we'll see.

09:22.340 --> 09:31.260
So the method inspired an ideology and ideology is just that, it's an ideology and it's rigid

09:31.260 --> 09:41.460
and basically the method doesn't really imply that the ideology is true.

09:41.460 --> 09:48.180
So when I'm attacking reductionism, I'm not attacking the method, I'm attacking the worldview.

09:48.180 --> 09:56.780
And so that worldview, we can say that basically, so hard to determine is part of the reductionist

09:56.780 --> 09:57.900
worldview.

09:57.900 --> 10:04.220
So thought experiment that some people are familiar with, I'm sure Laplace's demon, but

10:04.220 --> 10:14.020
basically Laplace was a French mathematician that took Newton's kind of model of reality

10:14.020 --> 10:16.300
and applied it to everything.

10:16.300 --> 10:19.580
Newton himself was kind of a mystic when it comes to life, he didn't really think that

10:19.580 --> 10:23.620
physics apply to organisms or at least to humans.

10:23.620 --> 10:34.020
But Laplace really came up with the idea that basically the evolution of the universe is

10:34.020 --> 10:42.700
just this clockwork universe where it's like a machine with cogs that are just turning.

10:42.700 --> 10:48.140
So there's no room for agency and free will in that picture.

10:48.140 --> 10:57.060
When Boltzmann came along in the 19th century and came up with statistical mechanics, the

10:57.060 --> 11:02.540
clockwork universe kind of became the billiard ball universe, but it's just the idea that

11:02.540 --> 11:11.140
everything in the universe is made of atoms and that these atoms are interacting and that's

11:11.140 --> 11:12.140
the whole picture.

11:12.580 --> 11:17.500
So the ideology says we're nothing more than our atoms, so we don't make decisions, consciousness

11:17.500 --> 11:23.580
is just an epiphenomenon and it feels to us like we are, but actually this trajectory

11:23.580 --> 11:30.540
was determined basically, not basically from the moment of the Big Bang and there's kind

11:30.540 --> 11:38.060
of no freedom in anything and no future other than what was determined from the beginning.

11:38.060 --> 11:42.420
So the second law of thermodynamics also sort of shaped the reductionists were abused

11:42.420 --> 11:46.460
as the universe is becoming increasingly disordered.

11:46.460 --> 11:50.540
There's actually kind of two different interpretations of the second law.

11:50.540 --> 11:58.380
The first one kind of emerged from the work of Carnot and Clausius, the kind of original

11:58.380 --> 12:06.460
thermodynamics work where entropy was about a measure of energy that can't be used for

12:06.460 --> 12:07.460
work.

12:07.460 --> 12:16.380
It's a measure of like useless energy where later with Boltzmann he tried to put the second

12:16.380 --> 12:21.460
law on like a statistical basis based on like atomic theory.

12:21.460 --> 12:31.100
So basically people applied Boltzmann's statistical interpretation of the second law to the universe

12:31.100 --> 12:35.940
and came up with this notion that the universe is becoming increasingly disordered, which

12:35.940 --> 12:42.100
isn't great for life because it means that life is transient and likely cosmically insignificant

12:42.100 --> 12:49.500
and this worldview is associated with materialism which doesn't recognize consciousness as real,

12:49.500 --> 12:57.020
certainly doesn't recognize it as having causal power and historically it often ignored apparently

12:57.020 --> 13:02.620
in material phenomena like energy and information and mental processes.

13:02.620 --> 13:10.980
I am just going to grab my charger so sounds good.

13:10.980 --> 13:14.700
This doesn't die but I will be right back.

13:14.700 --> 13:18.220
Take your time.

13:18.220 --> 13:23.780
So those who are watching live please feel free to leave a comment or a question.

13:23.780 --> 13:26.340
I'm writing some things down.

13:26.340 --> 13:40.580
We'll look forward to the return of electrical power to Bobby.

13:40.580 --> 13:46.300
All right my first live stream I will be more prepared my return to part two that's something

13:46.300 --> 13:52.700
else I told Daniel is that this is kind of like part one and I come back and talk about

13:52.700 --> 13:54.620
the ideas that come after.

13:54.620 --> 14:00.700
So it will have 15.2 it will be awesome it's an infinite sequence it's the sequence is

14:00.700 --> 14:11.860
always yours great okay so reductionist worldview says that all life forms including humans

14:11.860 --> 14:16.940
are nothing more than collections of atoms obligatorily following fixed and arbitrary

14:16.940 --> 14:22.260
mechanical trajectories determined solely by math and not by mine.

14:22.260 --> 14:31.540
So this worldview if you convince someone that they don't have free will because you

14:31.540 --> 14:37.260
tell them about the reductionist worldview there was actually a study where they did

14:37.260 --> 14:44.860
this and they read participants passage from Francis Crick explaining that it appears that

14:44.860 --> 14:53.940
we don't have any free will the participants actually on subsequent tests were more likely

14:53.940 --> 14:58.780
to cheat on the test because they felt like they didn't have any personal responsibility

14:58.780 --> 15:04.220
they weren't making the decisions therefore they could cheat that's kind of funny because

15:04.220 --> 15:09.780
they are actually you can see that like by what they're like being told that they are

15:09.780 --> 15:16.700
changing their behavior so it is having some kind of effect if we do in fact have agency

15:16.700 --> 15:22.300
or free will and we're kind of talking about agency we don't really get into free will

15:22.300 --> 15:29.800
but those are related topics but if that's not true then that's really bad that the majority

15:29.800 --> 15:33.180
of scientists are telling people we don't have free will because the people that believe

15:33.180 --> 15:39.340
this it's having negative effects on for example mental health other studies have shown that

15:39.940 --> 15:46.380
believe in no free will can lead to depression and believe in free will can have all these positive

15:46.380 --> 15:52.500
effects. Of course as soon as I start talking about free will I'm sure a lot of people have

15:52.500 --> 15:58.140
objections might think that there's no way that we can have room for free will in a physical

15:58.140 --> 16:04.260
worldview but that's exactly what we're going to begin to talk about today the causal power of

16:04.300 --> 16:11.820
information and that basically organisms are agents that are cybernetic control units so

16:11.820 --> 16:24.180
as controllers we do have agency so and the belief that we're accidents of nature rather

16:24.180 --> 16:32.620
than natural manifestations of physical laws I'm sure also impacts our sense of well-being just

16:32.620 --> 16:40.340
so you know I'm not making this up I can I'll give you some quotes from really famous physicists

16:40.340 --> 16:46.460
who are kind of militant reductionists so Brian Green says I think it's very important to face

16:46.460 --> 16:51.740
up to the truth of reality which is in fact that life and consciousness is a fleeting phenomenon

16:51.740 --> 16:58.580
on the entire cosmological timeline. Brian Green just came out with a book and he's like

16:58.860 --> 17:04.700
going on interviews just saying this and it's really interesting because some other famous

17:04.700 --> 17:09.260
physicists don't agree at all and he's stating it like it's a complete fact so for example David

17:09.260 --> 17:15.380
Deutsch would not agree with this and we'll get into that Sabine Hauston Felder is another person

17:15.380 --> 17:24.500
I know some of the some of my friends in the community who are these people you know working on

17:24.820 --> 17:30.660
emergence and causation stuff get bothered by her statements because she is also very

17:32.100 --> 17:37.060
ultra-reductionistic so I wish people would stop insisting they have free will it's terribly

17:37.060 --> 17:41.460
annoying insisting that free will exist is bad science like insisting that horoscopes tell

17:41.460 --> 17:47.620
you something about the future it's not compatible with our knowledge about nature so I'm saying

17:47.620 --> 17:53.380
that's wrong we won't get into free will that much but if you have questions at the end we will

17:54.100 --> 18:01.380
talk about how information adaptive information gets built up by evolution in

18:02.180 --> 18:08.580
adaptive systems complex adaptive systems and you will see how these systems actually do control

18:08.580 --> 18:15.060
their own future so Sam Harris is another anti-free will person says you're not controlling

18:15.060 --> 18:19.940
the storm and you are not lost in it you are the storm so it's kind of funny because he's using a

18:19.940 --> 18:28.580
metaphor here but what this story kind of reveals is that yes we are a storm that's right we are a

18:28.580 --> 18:36.420
dissipative structure like a storm emerges to dissipate an energy gradient and we're not really

18:36.420 --> 18:41.060
going to talk about that that's what the first part of the book is about the origins part but

18:42.100 --> 18:46.900
I'm just pointing it out because it's interesting because we are like a storm in that aspect

18:47.460 --> 18:54.660
but we also differ from a storm because a storm does not have agency a storm does not have the

18:54.660 --> 18:59.780
ability to seek out new energy gradients it's just kind of

19:02.340 --> 19:09.460
being pushed around by these gradients in nature where organisms are actually

19:10.340 --> 19:16.340
controllers and so you are a storm but you do have control over this storm

19:18.180 --> 19:27.060
so these people are kind of have the opposite view so Julio Tinoni creator of integrated

19:27.060 --> 19:32.180
information theory says there is true free will a great lecture that just popped up I think

19:32.180 --> 19:39.140
months ago where he gives a two-hour talk on basically integrate information and how it shows

19:39.220 --> 19:48.100
that systems do you have causal power and in a way have free will so depending on your definition

19:48.100 --> 19:54.500
of free will we do that free will according to his model David Doge said in an interview with

19:54.500 --> 20:00.980
John Horgan just a year ago or so I'm sure we have free will Christoph Koch says explains how

20:00.980 --> 20:06.020
you know there are a lot of experiments the LeBet experiments which we will talk about next time

20:06.820 --> 20:13.860
that basically some people interpret it as not having free will but actually

20:15.060 --> 20:23.380
we will see later when you deliberate that's actually an act of free will these choices

20:23.380 --> 20:27.460
where we're actually where you bring your entire conscious being to that question and try to

20:27.460 --> 20:33.700
analyze it under all the various conditions and actually there was a study Koch did that kind of

20:34.420 --> 20:45.380
showed that the LeBet study was kind of interpreted wrong and for anyone who understands that stuff

20:45.380 --> 20:51.060
the readiness potential that was supposed to be proof that there was no free will disappeared when

20:51.060 --> 21:00.020
the decisions involved deliberation so yeah that's kind of meandering but I'm sure a lot of people

21:00.020 --> 21:07.300
are interested in this bigger picture of why this emergence paradigm is so radically different from

21:07.300 --> 21:15.620
the reductionist paradigm it kind of puts information front and center and systems that process

21:15.620 --> 21:24.900
information complex adaptive systems are computational systems and the systems in the with

21:24.900 --> 21:29.140
these systems information actually does have causal power we're going to explain what we mean by that

21:29.940 --> 21:37.060
so paradigm of emergence the collective says the collective behavior of interacting parts not

21:37.060 --> 21:41.380
simply how they function in isolation is key to understanding the emergence and evolution

21:41.380 --> 21:47.140
of all the fascinating organisms and ecosystems that make up the biosphere so it's really not about

21:48.020 --> 21:55.620
just like particles it's about the patterns that emerge when these systems find these certain

21:55.700 --> 22:02.180
configurations through basically Darwinian mechanisms and we'll see that self-organization

22:02.180 --> 22:08.420
too has a Darwinian dynamic each emergence in the cosmic self-organization process is brought

22:08.420 --> 22:12.740
about by higher order phase transition that moves life ever further away from a state of

22:12.740 --> 22:19.460
thermodynamic equilibrium and total disorder I'm assuming the audience knows that what

22:19.460 --> 22:26.900
thermodynamic equilibrium is it's basically if you have for example Boltzmann took a model of

22:28.580 --> 22:35.300
an ideal gas and explained that for example if the gas molecules are bunched up in the corner

22:35.300 --> 22:44.420
naturally it's going the gas is going to spread out until there's no pattern and basically it's

22:44.420 --> 22:53.380
like a completely mixed up state so equilibrium is associated with death and disorder because

22:54.420 --> 23:04.500
systems naturally tend toward this more mixed up un-patterned completely chaotic state

23:06.020 --> 23:13.300
of course later we're going to talk about why open systems that that rule doesn't apply basically

23:13.300 --> 23:17.860
systems that are open to the flow of energy can resist this tendency towards a disorder

23:17.860 --> 23:25.540
and that's really what the whole story is kind of based on um so through a nested series of such

23:25.540 --> 23:31.460
phase transitions these are also called these higher order phase transitions are major evolutionary

23:31.460 --> 23:37.540
transitions John Maynard Smith talked about them and metasystem transitions by the cyber-neticist

23:37.540 --> 23:43.460
Valentin Turchin basically the same concept with some subtle differences so the idea is that

23:43.460 --> 23:49.140
cosmic self-organization is a series of these transitions where functional things come together

23:49.140 --> 23:54.260
to make larger functional ones which come together to even to make even larger ones and so on and

23:54.260 --> 24:00.180
through this process adaptive complexity or life so that's a more general way to talk about life

24:01.060 --> 24:06.740
becomes better equipped to dominate the cosmos life requires an organization that is increasingly

24:06.740 --> 24:11.220
hierarchical and integrated and therefore more resilient and computationally powerful

24:13.140 --> 24:20.820
so here are just a couple of figures um you see this hierarchy uh in this structural hierarchy

24:20.820 --> 24:26.820
of matter in life this was adapted from a big physics journal I can't remember which one it was

24:26.820 --> 24:35.940
but um basically you know physicists are recognizing this hierarchy even when it extends to life so

24:35.940 --> 24:45.140
Jeffrey West's book scale comes to mind uh and so we see the hierarchy of science kind of naturally

24:45.140 --> 24:52.340
mirror this hierarchy of matter and life and um the reductionist picture would say that these

24:52.340 --> 25:01.300
things at the top here um are kind of insignificant parts of the story transient um but we will see

25:01.300 --> 25:09.700
that this you know the more we go up the more influence uh on cosmic evolution the phenomena have

25:11.300 --> 25:22.500
so uh Thomas Huxley's question about man's place in the cosmos uh is um basically the emergence

25:22.500 --> 25:27.860
of paradigm uh the paradigm of emergence I'm going to discuss and actually this is kind of

25:27.860 --> 25:33.700
maybe like in a specific or a new paradigm of emergence because it includes all this stuff about

25:33.700 --> 25:38.980
thermodynamics and information theory um sense that emergence the emergence and evolution of

25:38.980 --> 25:44.340
life minds societies and technology are all part of one thermodynamic process one evolutionary

25:44.340 --> 25:52.020
process one computational process unified by the concept of knowledge so uh this theory is a theory

25:52.020 --> 25:59.220
of knowledge creation um and so knowledge is going to be the unifying theme and we'll briefly

25:59.220 --> 26:04.740
talk about epistemology I wanted to talk about it more but it just would have been too long um cosmic

26:04.740 --> 26:11.220
evolution uh in this paradigm is a universal process of becoming as opposed to being so the

26:11.220 --> 26:17.700
universe isn't this static thing uh it's actually evolving very much like an organism or a complex

26:17.780 --> 26:24.180
adaptive system um so it's not a panpsychic theory in this theory consciousness emerges that's very

26:24.180 --> 26:32.100
important um but you might call it emergent panpsychism uh because uh as this evolutionary

26:32.100 --> 26:38.740
process proceeds uh an animate matter as life spreads gets converted into animate matter

26:39.780 --> 26:44.580
so in this picture humans are neither a cosmic accident nor the end goal of evolution

26:45.460 --> 26:51.780
so we are instead a step on the evolutionary ladder of becoming and we are also potentially an

26:51.780 --> 26:57.620
essential driver of increasing cosmic complexity so this big idea is that the universe is undergoing

26:57.620 --> 27:03.700
this majestic self-organizing process and at this moment of time at least in this corner of the

27:03.700 --> 27:12.100
universe we are the stars of the show um this picture is from Eric Chasen's uh both the rise of

27:12.180 --> 27:18.340
complexity uh cosmic evolution the rise of complexity uh he's a harvard astrophysicist

27:18.340 --> 27:23.540
um but i just used uh freeman daison code here because it seemed irrelevant it's conceivable

27:23.540 --> 27:27.860
that life may have a larger role to play than we have yet imagined life may succeed against

27:27.860 --> 27:33.620
all odds in molding the universe to its own purpose so i guess brian green doesn't buy that at all

27:33.620 --> 27:42.100
but um if that's true then uh as as cosmology cosmologists have to think about the the role

27:42.100 --> 27:47.620
of life there's a lot of people who have said similar things like septaloid and famously

27:47.620 --> 27:55.620
raker as well um so just a couple quotes here so you know you know when when people hear these

27:55.620 --> 28:00.420
terms progress there's just the stigma immediately they thought like oh someone's trying to sneak in

28:00.420 --> 28:07.940
religion or some intelligent design theory um so you see these trusted names of physics here david

28:07.940 --> 28:12.740
oich has narrowly conceived evolutionary theory considers as mere vehicles for the replication

28:12.740 --> 28:17.620
of our genes or memes and it refuses to address the question of why evolution has tended to create

28:17.620 --> 28:23.620
ever greater adaptive complexity or the role that such complexity plays in the wider scheme of things

28:23.620 --> 28:29.460
so there is clearly implying that adaptive complexity does have this larger role to play

28:29.780 --> 28:35.700
um we now see how it is possible for the universe to increase both organization and entropy at the

28:35.700 --> 28:40.660
same time the optimistic and pessimistic eras of time can coexist the universe can display

28:40.660 --> 28:46.020
creative unidirectional unidirectional progress even in the face of the second law because as

28:46.020 --> 28:54.580
paul davies says that um so that's really uh kind of a key point uh in this is that um

28:55.540 --> 29:01.860
the second law actually is in a sense driving this increase in progress so not only can we have

29:01.860 --> 29:07.060
unidirectional progress in the face of the second law uh it seems that this progress requires the

29:07.060 --> 29:13.140
second law uh because we'll see that the second law is the basically the natural selection pressure

29:13.140 --> 29:19.940
for uh self-organizing systems so in a sense the second law is both uh shiva the destroyer and

29:20.020 --> 29:29.140
Brahma the creator um so a goal of this unifying theory of reality uh i've been calling the great

29:29.140 --> 29:38.180
conciliance it was actually a name uh suggested by marco lin who is uh is a firstonian and

29:38.180 --> 29:45.780
influenced some of this talk um so basically the unifying theory of reality illuminates the

29:45.860 --> 29:51.060
connection between complexity cognition consciousness and cosmic evolution or matter

29:51.060 --> 29:56.180
of mind and cosmos um and it's really based on complexity science it's a lot broader than

29:56.180 --> 30:02.660
complexity science but i guess that name kind of you know includes everything so it's a unification

30:02.660 --> 30:07.380
of major sciences of our time including but not limited to physics biology neuroscience computer

30:07.380 --> 30:12.260
science evolutionary theory and statistics and basically it describes complex adaptive systems

30:12.260 --> 30:18.660
of all scales in terms of energy and information flows so it uses statistical thermodynamics

30:18.660 --> 30:25.780
information theory and cybernetics um so we will talk about those a bit uh coming up so if you

30:25.780 --> 30:33.460
want to see kind of like a map of what sort of informs uh this non-reductive theory of everything

30:33.780 --> 30:42.260
here you go so i know there's a lot of information so i'll kind of try to simplify this for everyone

30:42.980 --> 30:47.780
um there are some unifying paradigms that have emerged so basically this theory is nothing new

30:47.780 --> 30:56.180
it's basically evolutionary epistemology um after that came universal Darwinism and later uh right

30:56.180 --> 31:01.860
now we're seeing this kind of revolution with like Bayesian inference and these ideas being applied

31:01.860 --> 31:15.940
to everything um so uh being informed uh by these um paradigms and uh combining those paradigms are

31:15.940 --> 31:21.380
updating them i should say with uh information from non-equilibrium thermodynamics so we're

31:21.380 --> 31:27.780
talking about the thermodynamics of open systems uh information theory so Shannon's theory uh

31:28.740 --> 31:34.260
some of you will know that information theory is related very closely to non-equilibrium

31:34.260 --> 31:43.460
thermodynamics and basically uh Boltzmann's statistical entropy is mathematically the same as uh

31:43.460 --> 31:51.140
Shannon entropy or information entropy which is a measure of uncertainty um if i had more time i would

31:51.140 --> 31:58.020
go through thermodynamics and the different types of entropy but uh we don't have time for that but

31:58.020 --> 32:04.340
if anyone has any questions i can clarify um cybernetics was basically information theory

32:05.060 --> 32:11.940
applied to biology adaptive systems it was the first science of adaptive systems really and uh

32:11.940 --> 32:17.540
it's funny while writing this uh i found out because you know i hadn't i had heard the name

32:17.540 --> 32:25.460
cybernetics but it wasn't clear how important it was um in a talk by uh Jim Crutchfeld uh

32:25.460 --> 32:32.020
Santa Fe Institute basically revealed that uh because cybernetics got associated with like the

32:32.020 --> 32:38.020
Russian uh like during the Cold War kind of like the Russian agenda um cybernetics was used

32:38.020 --> 32:45.380
to design like heat seeking missiles uh Norbert Wiener's theory was almost immediately applied

32:45.380 --> 32:54.340
for military uses and because of that it stopped being taught in American uh colleges um so uh yeah

32:54.340 --> 32:59.540
it's really important and it was actually uh emerging at the same time as information theory

32:59.540 --> 33:05.940
people were already uh thinking about systems in terms of information flows but it's more than

33:05.940 --> 33:12.900
information theory because it's a science of feedback um so dynamical systems theory or

33:12.900 --> 33:18.580
complex adaptive systems is kind of like an offshoot of that um all of these inform what

33:18.580 --> 33:24.660
i've called universal Bayesianism not the only person to call it that um i had searched that

33:24.660 --> 33:31.140
term and found Adam Saffron's uh paper on integrated world modeling theory that used that same term

33:31.780 --> 33:39.140
but uh John Campbell has been a researcher um who has uh done a lot to show this equivalence between

33:39.860 --> 33:47.060
uh evolutionary processes and processes of Bayesian inference we're gonna talk about that in a little

33:47.060 --> 33:54.340
bit um so yeah if anybody has any questions about that but really all of these things origin of life

33:54.340 --> 34:00.900
research integrate evolutionary theory um if you haven't checked out the work of these people like

34:00.900 --> 34:07.460
everybody here's worth reading their work but uh so from that we get the unifying theory of reality

34:07.460 --> 34:12.580
that is based on what i call the evolutionary epistemology universal Darwinism universal

34:12.580 --> 34:17.860
Bayesianism framework that's a long name i'm aware of that but it's just to show that these

34:17.860 --> 34:28.580
three theories are basically the same theory um so universal Darwinism says that the universe is

34:28.580 --> 34:33.780
evolving at every scale through both competitive evolution and through self-organization which

34:33.780 --> 34:39.140
is cooperative evolution among agents that have formed a collective unit so it started with Richard

34:39.140 --> 34:46.340
Dawkins and his concepts of the meme and the selfish gene that uh memes uh were these uh cultural

34:46.340 --> 34:54.980
units that were equivalent to genes and so we started to see how information was this paradigm

34:54.980 --> 35:00.580
that could be extended beyond biology and then we had Dan Dennett and Darwin's dangerous idea

35:00.580 --> 35:07.380
really extend this to like everything to self-organizing systems to like cultural and

35:07.380 --> 35:14.020
technological systems uh evolutionary epistemology came before that it was based on Karl Popper's

35:14.020 --> 35:19.460
philosophy but it was actually invented by cognitive psychologist Donald Campbell and

35:19.460 --> 35:26.500
basically that said that the evolutionary process is a problem solving procedure that creates knowledge

35:26.500 --> 35:37.220
so uh the information stored in genomes and in uh brains and cultural memory uh basically

35:38.020 --> 35:43.540
that all that knowledge accumulates from an evolutionary process and it's really helpful

35:43.540 --> 35:49.620
to think of it as knowledge especially when we start to talk about this in in uh the context of

35:49.620 --> 35:59.060
thermodynamics and information because uh basically this knowledge is what allows life adaptive systems

35:59.060 --> 36:06.900
to stay far from equilibrium they can resist this tendency towards decay life can continue to persist

36:06.900 --> 36:14.500
if it can acquire the knowledge that it needs to essentially to find free energy that will allow

36:14.580 --> 36:21.940
it to sustain itself um so we'll talk about that in a second more um so universal Bayesianism

36:21.940 --> 36:27.060
is a Bayesian update of the first two paradigms knowledge is encoded uh so the knowledge that

36:27.060 --> 36:33.380
evolutionary epistemology can describe it's actually encoded in biological systems uh

36:33.380 --> 36:39.380
in the form of a world model so this model is an internal representation and statistical mapping

36:39.380 --> 36:44.260
of the environment which gets updated through adaptation and adaptive learning and talk about

36:44.260 --> 36:54.100
that process um really the the whole Bayesian brain hypothesis and free energy principle

36:54.100 --> 37:00.020
is inspired by cybernetics heavily so Ross Ashby's good regulator theorem and law of

37:00.020 --> 37:06.020
requisite variety which we'll talk about was kind of the first talk of systems having models and

37:06.020 --> 37:11.380
having to model the environment um so Crawfordston says inference is actually quite close to a

37:11.380 --> 37:16.260
theory of everything including evolution consciousness and life itself uh we're not

37:16.260 --> 37:23.540
going to go into those bigger implications that would be at the uh end of the book in the last

37:23.540 --> 37:30.660
chapter but basically this isn't just a theory about evolution um well it is evolution but

37:30.660 --> 37:38.100
evolution applied way more broadly so quantum mechanics has uh an interpretation that's consistent

37:38.100 --> 37:44.420
with this and bigger problems like the fine-tuning of the constants and parameters that allow for

37:44.420 --> 37:50.420
the emergence of life in the universe we can actually uh probably have the best explanation

37:50.420 --> 37:55.780
for the fine-tuning problem and the measurement problem of quantum mechanics uh with this theory

37:55.780 --> 38:02.260
um we won't talk about it but just so you know next time uh cosmological natural selection by

38:02.260 --> 38:06.980
Lee Smolin is the theory that kind of addresses the fine-tuning problem from a universal Darwinism

38:06.980 --> 38:14.500
perspective while quantum Darwinism uh addresses the measurement problem um so we will save that

38:14.500 --> 38:20.420
from next time but feel free to ask questions about any of those so what does this do I have this

38:20.420 --> 38:27.300
name poetic metanaturalism I meant to take that out but uh next time we'll get into why I chose

38:27.300 --> 38:34.580
that name it's actually um it sounds kind of like you know like complex or buzzword or jargony but

38:34.580 --> 38:42.020
there's actually very practical reasons for having that name um so this uh unifying theory

38:42.020 --> 38:48.020
bridges matter with mine so universal Darwinism gives us a picture of the open-ended complexity

38:48.020 --> 38:55.220
growth uh that this whole idea is based on the idea that evolution keeps producing uh

38:55.220 --> 39:05.620
increasingly complex intelligent forms of life excuse me um so uh yeah universal Bayesianism is

39:06.340 --> 39:13.060
the link that kind of connects those paradigms with uh consciousness so again we won't get into

39:13.060 --> 39:20.260
that today but when uh you understand that knowledge is stored stored in the form of a world model

39:20.260 --> 39:26.180
that a system that models itself can experience then we start to get a better understanding of

39:26.180 --> 39:32.100
like what consciousness is consciousness is it's a it's a mental model so it's not a traditional

39:32.100 --> 39:37.140
panpsychic theory even though I know first in and Levin and some of his colleagues have kind of

39:37.140 --> 39:44.340
been flirting with panpsychism this theory would say that's wrong and it's kind of uh reduces

39:44.420 --> 39:51.300
consciousness to something trivial um by saying that it's in everything like um a proton is conscious

39:51.300 --> 39:56.820
because it's a triad of quarks that have to be in a certain configuration so there is some minimal

39:56.820 --> 40:03.860
level of integrated information um that's not enough uh to get a conscious experience again

40:03.860 --> 40:09.860
observer um so saffron's integrated world modern theory says that you need a model with spatial,

40:09.860 --> 40:15.060
temporal and causal coherence I would also argue that it requires self-modeling capacity

40:16.260 --> 40:20.660
talk about that a little bit at the end if anyone's interested um but this theory is supposed to

40:20.660 --> 40:28.980
bridge mine with cosmic evolution so the story starts with the second law um Daniel if there's

40:28.980 --> 40:35.460
any questions about that like intro let me know yeah if not I can just proceed could I ask two

40:35.460 --> 40:42.260
questions from the chat sure okay the first question is from blue blue wrote do you think

40:42.260 --> 40:47.700
that non-living autonomous agents with multiple competing priorities such as self-driving cars

40:48.260 --> 40:53.540
have free will if not what is the defining difference between these systems and humans

40:54.740 --> 41:00.980
uh no I don't think they have free will so um adaptive information is a special type of information

41:00.980 --> 41:08.100
I do think those things and this is kind of following Sarah Walker's lead who's at Arizona

41:08.100 --> 41:15.540
State I think she's also SFI faculty now but basically um to have self-driving cars you first

41:15.540 --> 41:21.780
need life so anything like a self-driving car that's like this information processing system

41:22.500 --> 41:30.580
if you were to come across a broken down self-driving car on some planet and you saw that

41:30.580 --> 41:35.540
you would have to infer that there was also life there because life is part of the trajectory to

41:35.540 --> 41:42.820
get to that but I wouldn't say that it has free will because it's just this input output machine

41:43.940 --> 41:52.340
with a defined set of algorithms and uh adaptive systems are more flexible uh and

41:53.300 --> 42:00.740
they're okay so in the next next time we'll talk about actually the emergence of agency

42:01.460 --> 42:10.340
which occurs with the origin of life or a biogenesis and you basically um because this self-organized

42:10.340 --> 42:17.540
system that would be kind of like the proto-cell um is evolving through a mechanism that Darwinian

42:17.540 --> 42:23.780
dynamic for self-organization that will explain in a bit it builds up information and at some point

42:23.780 --> 42:29.540
there's a phase transition where the information that's getting built up in the system uh basically

42:30.580 --> 42:37.620
gains what Sarah Walker and Paul Davies call informational control so there's a point where

42:37.620 --> 42:47.140
information actually starts calling the shots and you can see the difference between uh systems

42:47.140 --> 42:54.180
that where there is informational control so living systems and inanimate systems because for

42:54.180 --> 43:01.540
example um inanimate systems uh their movement can be predicted with Newton's laws so anyone who's

43:01.540 --> 43:08.420
taken first year physics probably had to do an exercise where you're trying to predict the movement

43:08.420 --> 43:16.420
of some macroscopic system like a ball that gets kicked or pushed by a gust of wind and what you do

43:16.420 --> 43:22.900
is you um you have to draw out all the forces acting on the system and then you can understand

43:22.900 --> 43:29.300
where the system's going to go with life you don't need an external force for it to start for example

43:29.300 --> 43:36.980
climbing uphill um that's internally generated of course it's not magic uh the adaptive system the

43:36.980 --> 43:43.620
agent uh has stored energy that it's extracted from the environment so for example humans that

43:43.620 --> 43:50.420
are eating food and there's a metabolic process that's driving this but uh still yeah you with

43:50.420 --> 43:56.900
living systems that where information has causal power uh basically the trajectory of the system

43:56.900 --> 44:03.460
can't be predicted by these fundamental laws of physics um Philip Ball the journalist that

44:04.180 --> 44:10.100
has been talking about this um his recent article which caused a lot of controversy between like

44:10.820 --> 44:16.100
the reductionist like talking about free will and agency um and there's a lot of confusion around

44:16.100 --> 44:22.100
that so people like Jerry Coyne were like trying to shoot it down and yeah hopefully I can talk about

44:22.100 --> 44:29.460
that um I guess we'll talk about that next time because there's a lot of uh confusion about what

44:29.460 --> 44:35.220
we're saying when we say something has agency or free will but his example is if you throw throw a

44:35.220 --> 44:42.100
ball and a bird off a tower and you can predict what one is going to do you can't predict what the

44:42.100 --> 44:48.820
other is going to do um interestingly though I would say that the bird's not completely unpredictable

44:48.820 --> 44:52.580
you can predict that it's not going to hit the ground it's not going to splat on the ground

44:53.140 --> 44:58.180
it's going to fly away uh you have to understand the bird in terms of its goals so you have to

44:58.180 --> 45:03.380
understand you know the bird and its environment and the information that got built up through

45:03.380 --> 45:10.420
evolution and then we can start to predict the bird uh its statistical behavior so inanimate

45:10.420 --> 45:16.420
systems you can pretty much precisely predict the movement unless they're chaotic systems which is

45:16.420 --> 45:22.980
another story but with life um yeah it's not predictable in that same way with like low level

45:23.540 --> 45:28.980
laws of physics but uh I'm arguing that actually life is more predictable than we've thought

45:29.540 --> 45:36.740
but you need things like uh non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and for example uh free

45:36.740 --> 45:44.100
energy principle um so you can say that you know an organism will try to minimize free energy or

45:44.820 --> 45:50.660
minimize the difference between uh its models prediction and reality so it will try to minimize

45:50.660 --> 45:58.580
prediction error and that's a way that we can start to describe uh behaviors statistically so

45:59.860 --> 46:05.540
um you know was there another one yep can I ask the second question yeah I I know I didn't

46:05.540 --> 46:11.940
completely answer that but uh that will require like the all of the points that I would get into

46:11.940 --> 46:16.500
in the second talk but it's a great question yeah I would have written in a larger margin if I had

46:16.580 --> 46:24.180
more time the second question is from Joseph Clark who wrote first complimented your talk and

46:24.180 --> 46:31.140
let you knew that you were an interesting guy so then the question was how far do you think the

46:31.140 --> 46:37.700
universe can organize itself and what does that look like okay great that's a perfect question

46:37.700 --> 46:43.380
to lead into the next part and hopefully by the end of this uh we will have some sort of answer for

46:43.380 --> 46:47.620
that which is good because I when I started making the beginning of the presentation I was

46:47.620 --> 46:52.020
going to get to consciousness and free will and I ran out of time so there's been a lot of talk

46:52.020 --> 46:58.820
about things that I won't get to but that we will get to um so uh the story starts with the second

46:58.820 --> 47:08.260
law um so the second law of thermodynamics as popularly popularly understood says that uh

47:08.260 --> 47:16.580
systems naturally become increasingly disordered um that's really just because of the large scale

47:16.580 --> 47:24.180
effects of chance so there are many ways to be disordered and there are relatively fewer ways

47:24.180 --> 47:32.580
to be patterned um so a system that's this collective of particles so this evolving

47:32.580 --> 47:39.780
ensemble of particles uh will naturally tend to move towards a configuration that's completely

47:39.780 --> 47:47.220
spread out and mixed up there are no uh energy gradient so no work can be extracted that's a

47:47.220 --> 47:55.140
state of equilibrium so we are going to use this word thermodynamic equilibrium uh to mean death

47:55.140 --> 48:01.300
in disorder so life wants to resist the tendency towards equilibrium and wants to stay ordered

48:02.100 --> 48:06.500
what's interesting about this is that it applies to all this is kind of like

48:07.380 --> 48:14.260
where the free energy principle in first sense Bayesian brain hypothesis it frames everything

48:14.260 --> 48:19.780
this way so I thought it was a good way to kind of frame it here is that you start with the second

48:19.780 --> 48:27.300
law and any conceivable system any ordered system for it to continue to persist has to resist this

48:27.300 --> 48:37.700
tendency so um basically uh Schrodinger the guy everybody knows from quantum mechanics in the

48:37.700 --> 48:45.060
in the cat thought experiment he wrote a book called what is life in the 40s and uh basically

48:45.060 --> 48:48.980
kind of solved this paradox like if there's a second law and things become more disordered

48:48.980 --> 48:53.780
than what's with life and what's with the biosphere and all this complexity that we see around us

48:54.740 --> 49:00.980
is and he explained actually Boltzmann explained this before him um but Boltzmann said a lot to

49:00.980 --> 49:08.020
contradict this as well um or just didn't follow this to its implications but Schrodinger explained

49:08.020 --> 49:15.060
that open systems by feeding off uh free energy in the environment so free energy is just energy

49:15.060 --> 49:21.780
that uh you can extract work from so it's ordered energy as opposed to energy that's been dissipated

49:21.780 --> 49:27.780
in the form of heat you can't extract energy useful energy from that energy it's still there it's

49:27.780 --> 49:34.100
just spread out and it's it's you can't harness it collecting it would cost more than you get out

49:34.100 --> 49:41.620
of it so um Schrodinger explained that uh if a system can get free energy which he called negative

49:41.620 --> 49:52.020
entropy or energy uh negentropies was called by uh someone later um so to understand how ordered

49:52.020 --> 49:59.140
systems stay ordered uh you basically need to understand that they have to uh constantly be

49:59.140 --> 50:06.100
extracting free energy from the environment the moment that they can't extract more free energy

50:06.100 --> 50:15.460
is the moment that the system dies and decays to equilibrium so um basically uh the second

50:15.460 --> 50:24.020
law is not violated by life because um in this effort to stay far from equilibrium life it keeps

50:24.020 --> 50:30.020
extracting that ordered free energy and keeps dissipating it as heat so so it's basically

50:30.020 --> 50:39.140
exporting entropy into the environment so the order um that is maintained uh is paid for

50:39.780 --> 50:46.020
by the dissipated energy which comes becomes thermal entropy so there are multiple definitions

50:46.020 --> 50:50.020
of entropy so you have thermal entropy which is heat entropy and then statistical entropy

50:51.540 --> 50:58.100
which explains thermal entropy but it has a broader domain of application so you can talk

50:58.100 --> 51:05.860
about a shuffling a deck of cards and you can talk about like the statistical entropy increasing

51:06.820 --> 51:11.780
if the deck is ordered and it starts becoming mixed up through the shuffling but the deck

51:11.780 --> 51:18.900
of cards the thermal entropy uh isn't changing much at all so there's different types of entropy

51:18.900 --> 51:26.100
there's also information entropy which has to do with the um uh the number of messages that

51:26.100 --> 51:32.340
could be sent across the channel instead of um the number of states that a system can be in

51:32.340 --> 51:38.820
the number of microstates without changing the macro state macro state or uh the kind of um

51:38.820 --> 51:44.420
collective properties of the system there's a really neat relationship between statistical

51:44.420 --> 51:51.300
entropy and information entropy which i won't talk about here it was really fleshed out by uh et

51:51.300 --> 52:01.460
janes uh but yeah so information and entropy like go hand in hand um just to give a little more

52:01.460 --> 52:07.780
context before we get into the details uh david doidge and this great ted talk um called after

52:07.780 --> 52:11.780
billions of years of monotony the universe is waking up says if one can speak of a cosmic war

52:11.780 --> 52:17.300
it's a war between monotony and novelty between stasis and creativity and in this war our side

52:17.300 --> 52:23.620
is not destined to lose if we choose to apply our unique capacity to create explanatory knowledge

52:23.620 --> 52:29.380
we could win so that's very different than brian green story and it kind of gets at the second

52:29.380 --> 52:36.340
question that was asked there how how far can this complexity increase go and so this kind of fore

52:36.340 --> 52:41.220
shadows that maybe it doesn't have a limit and that seems you know most people think that would

52:41.220 --> 52:45.060
go against the second law of thermodynamics we're going to see why that's not necessarily true

52:45.860 --> 52:51.380
um but you can also see this cosmic war as this fight between order versus disorder life versus

52:51.380 --> 52:59.380
entropy and knowledge versus uncertainty or ignorance um but is life's battle against disorder

52:59.940 --> 53:05.860
good versus evil or yin and yang so i'm going to kind of argue that these two things kind of

53:06.740 --> 53:13.140
have this uh you can describe their relationship as causally dependent and it's kind of like this

53:13.140 --> 53:23.780
dialectic between life and uh disorder um and it is through this sort of uh interaction that

53:24.580 --> 53:31.460
creates progress so we have some eastern ideas mentioned again um but when i was writing the

53:31.460 --> 53:37.060
book a friend that practices buddhism called me and told me about this interdependent

53:37.060 --> 53:41.380
co-arising idea which i thought was really cool so we're going to come up with this what we call

53:41.380 --> 53:47.060
popper's principle which is uh problems create progress we're going to see that this problem

53:47.620 --> 53:56.100
of entropy that this tendency towards decay is what actually forces systems to evolve basically

53:56.100 --> 54:01.460
it forces them to search what's called the configuration space for the faith space for

54:01.460 --> 54:07.620
the state space to find configurations that are good at extracting energy and that allows it to

54:07.700 --> 54:12.980
stay far from equilibrium so we're going to have some figures soon so this stuff that's

54:12.980 --> 54:19.860
kind of abstract becomes a little bit more concrete just out of respect to the earlier

54:19.860 --> 54:26.900
request how about you check the time and feel then how fast you'd like to continue however much you

54:26.900 --> 54:31.060
want to present and then if you want to take any questions but first just check the time and let

54:31.620 --> 54:38.900
just i i how i i didn't uh i didn't uh notice when we started so about how long have i been

54:38.900 --> 54:48.420
going i would say five zero minutes really okay how long can we go we can go another

54:49.460 --> 54:58.180
uh 99 minutes okay um i'll try to go through it a little bit faster um but yeah so um

54:58.420 --> 55:06.020
um but if we use all the time i told you yesterday that i was feeling uh oh i had a sore throat

55:06.020 --> 55:10.020
and uh the sore throat's better today i'm hopped up on cold medicine i'm sure i'm gonna

55:10.660 --> 55:16.500
i'm gonna pay for tomorrow but um yeah if we use all the time with questions that would be good

55:16.500 --> 55:25.540
uh so in our everyday experiment experience things don't naturally become ordered unless

55:25.540 --> 55:32.660
someone intervenes rooms get messier buildings erode uh so we already talked about this trodinger's

55:33.460 --> 55:39.380
solution so we can think of life as a game uh so life has always been playing a game against

55:39.380 --> 55:46.260
the second law of thermodynamics there is another narrative that i won't go into but life is also

55:46.260 --> 55:53.060
an energy flow channel so life by existing and computing and trying to stay far from equilibrium

55:53.860 --> 56:00.820
is also increasing entropy uh actually the universe of life will increase entropy at a

56:00.820 --> 56:07.220
faster rate than the universe without life um which is pretty interesting so it's again not

56:07.220 --> 56:13.060
necessarily that life it's like battling against entropy and in many ways it increases entropy but

56:13.940 --> 56:18.580
there's also this story i guess what it's trying to battle is the tendency towards disorder so it

56:18.580 --> 56:24.260
depends on what type of entropy you're talking about um so the challenge in the game of life

56:24.260 --> 56:30.100
which applies to you as well as other simpler adaptive systems is to resist that tendency

56:30.100 --> 56:36.900
so this gives life a goal for teleology so teleology was associated with kind of this mystical thing but

56:38.020 --> 56:45.860
basically we'll we're seeing that teleology is just uh agency it's just a result goal-oriented

56:45.860 --> 56:51.860
behavior as a result of the information that's been accumulated over evolution so teleology

56:52.740 --> 56:59.140
the book uh tries to naturalize teleology and just say that they're these goal-oriented systems

56:59.140 --> 57:06.340
that behave different uh because they are acquiring information through Darwinian evolution um

57:06.980 --> 57:12.420
so life has to extract free energy that's how it stays in the game of life and to extract free

57:12.420 --> 57:18.660
energy it's it's not a simple task so the computational task of extracting free energy

57:19.780 --> 57:25.380
requires that the uh system acquire information about its environment otherwise it can't find

57:25.380 --> 57:32.180
energy uh it also requires that the system model its environment so the information is creating

57:32.180 --> 57:41.460
this predictive model this generative model and it is um that model that allows it to continuously

57:42.020 --> 57:49.140
find free energy um so we will explain that life strategy is it searches through a configuration

57:49.140 --> 57:54.980
space for solutions to the problem of survival through trial and error search uh variation

57:54.980 --> 58:01.620
and selection so we we know about evolution there's this genetic variation in natural selection

58:01.620 --> 58:07.700
and uh we're going to argue that that process that mechanism is much broader the evolutionary

58:07.700 --> 58:13.540
mechanism is actually the mechanism of the scientific method and of adaptive learning um

58:13.540 --> 58:17.780
and that mechanism is also a process that accumulates evidence-based knowledge so it's

58:17.780 --> 58:23.060
also a process of Bayesian inference we're going to explain why so here we have those different

58:23.060 --> 58:32.180
mechanisms with different names um so it's not included here but uh so if life is a game

58:32.180 --> 58:38.260
there are levels to this game uh and the levels we're going to see are these uh evolutionary

58:38.260 --> 58:46.660
transitions every time life graduates to this uh more uh complex hierarchical system like when

58:47.380 --> 58:51.860
single-celled organisms come together to form a multi-cellular organism and multi-cellular

58:51.860 --> 59:00.420
organisms come together to form communities like societies uh that you can view these evolutionary

59:00.500 --> 59:10.340
transitions as as life graduating to a new level so um we're going to talk about how adaptive

59:10.340 --> 59:16.260
information gets built up through evolution and uh we're calling that knowledge it's nice to have

59:16.260 --> 59:22.020
that word knowledge because this process of an adaptive system acquiring this information is

59:22.020 --> 59:27.380
actually reducing its uncertainty about the environment so it's it's reducing its ignorance

59:27.380 --> 59:34.740
about all the ways the surrounding world could potentially surprise it uh so knowledge is a

59:34.740 --> 59:42.100
nice word some philosophers like old school philosophers might have issue with that um because

59:42.100 --> 59:48.020
in some teachings like knowledge is something that like conscious beings with like awareness have

59:48.020 --> 59:53.380
but we're calling any adaptive information knowledge and it's that more of a technical

59:53.380 --> 01:00:00.740
definition because knowledge is that information which reduces uncertainty and you could actually

01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:06.340
quantify this process of evolution terence deacon has talked a lot about how you can do that with

01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:15.060
information measures um so just to explain this why is knowledge something that matters like does

01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:20.500
it have causal power or is it all just this this billiard ball universe where it's like these

01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:26.100
particles bump into each other and you can basically use uh fundamental laws of physics

01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:30.580
to describe like the trajectory of all the particles in the universe this is saying no

01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:36.820
that the information that gets built up through evolution has causal power such that these systems

01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:42.660
start to behave in ways that are different than what would be predicted from uh something our

01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:49.060
new laws so we also have this process of anti accretion that sarah walker likes to talk about

01:00:50.100 --> 01:00:57.060
but anti so anti accretion is uh basically we're familiar with uh planets pulling in matter

01:00:57.060 --> 01:01:04.260
so bodies like asteroids because gravity pulls matter in naturally but anti accretion is when a

01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:12.180
planet is ejecting matter and uh in many cases what well so the the only time we really see

01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:20.980
anti accretion uh is when you have a planet with a life on it so um right now

01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:28.740
bits of biosphere so humans and space rockets are being sent to other celestial bodies so that's a

01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:36.340
form of anti accretion uh sending up satellites you won't see a satellite get sent out if you see

01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:42.180
that in the universe uh like you're looking at some other solar system and you see a body

01:01:43.060 --> 01:01:48.180
sent out and put into orbit from a planet that's an indication that life is there that's a biosignature

01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:54.420
so she says that anti accretion requires comprehenders specifically the existence of

01:01:54.420 --> 01:02:05.380
physical systems with knowledge of newton's laws um so what does it all mean um it means we need

01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:16.740
knowledge uh to uh keep us out of thermodynamic equilibrium um so how do we acquire knowledge uh

01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:23.220
science is the most uh is the most salient example of the causal power of knowledge so

01:02:23.860 --> 01:02:31.220
science uh has uh eradicated lethal diseases built a global communication network called the

01:02:31.220 --> 01:02:37.140
internet and created weapons of apocalyptic power it's not always good this power of knowledge but um

01:02:38.660 --> 01:02:45.060
we see that there's something about the scientific method which is efficient at

01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:51.060
uh accumulating knowledge so we're going to talk about why and that's where we get into

01:02:51.060 --> 01:02:56.500
carl popper and evolutionary epistemology um so we know knowledge is important

01:02:58.260 --> 01:03:01.780
carl poppers says we're always faced with practical problems and out of these grow

01:03:01.780 --> 01:03:06.980
sometimes theoretical problems before we try to solve some of our problems by proposing theories

01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:16.100
so uh popper stresses that all of science starts with a problem either theoretical

01:03:16.100 --> 01:03:24.020
or practical um and it is that problem that forces us to seek out a solution so we can already see

01:03:24.020 --> 01:03:32.020
why this principle that i've called popper's principle uh says that problems create progress

01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:40.900
so some of these theories that we make to try to solve our problems will be wrong they'll be errors

01:03:41.540 --> 01:03:47.940
um but the idea with science is that those errors get filtered out by a process of testing your

01:03:47.940 --> 01:03:57.140
theories and a peer review process which gives criticism so uh knowledge is really uh for knowledge

01:03:57.140 --> 01:04:05.060
for us to know that some piece of information is knowledge it really needs to be tested and uh

01:04:05.060 --> 01:04:10.020
we call that evidence-based knowledge or evidence-based information so it's really the only true

01:04:10.020 --> 01:04:17.060
kind of knowledge because you don't know if something's true until you test it for example um

01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:27.460
um the world doesn't look round from a naive perspective it looks flat so for example um

01:04:27.460 --> 01:04:33.940
someone who had the first idea you know and i'm sure it was before anybody famous we knew someone

01:04:33.940 --> 01:04:41.860
had this idea and probably people blew it off but um uh some things that are true about reality

01:04:41.860 --> 01:04:47.700
are not immediate immediately apparent from like sensory observation from since data so we really

01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:53.700
need to test our theories if we are going to be sure about them um so what popper found out was

01:04:53.700 --> 01:05:00.740
the scientific method is an algorithm you call that algorithm conjecture and refutation and uh

01:05:01.780 --> 01:05:06.900
basically this is the method of hypothesis testing so you have a problem you believe can be solved

01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:12.740
you make an informed guess or conjecture to see if your theory can be refuted prove false by testing

01:05:12.740 --> 01:05:21.620
its predictions so uh people have pointed out like john cambell uh call first in that uh science is a

01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:26.580
process of inference so it recognizes statistical patterns and trends in nature that we can use to

01:05:26.580 --> 01:05:30.980
make increasingly accurate predictions um it would not be inaccurate than to say that the

01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:36.660
function or purpose of science is to generate predictive knowledge um and we can characterize

01:05:36.660 --> 01:05:40.980
that as a process of inference which basically means that scientists draw logical conclusions

01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:47.380
about the way the world works uh based on evidence based information acquired in the past but with

01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:56.420
never present awareness that the information can and will lead to um to new conclusions and deeper

01:05:56.420 --> 01:06:01.380
understanding so when we recognize this we also have to recognize that all of our models will

01:06:01.380 --> 01:06:06.580
have uncertainty um so we should never think that our models right every model is going to be

01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:13.300
proved wrong in some way but through the scientific process uh the idea is that we get closer and

01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:19.940
closer to truth so we can never reach perfect truth but in this model you can actually get

01:06:19.940 --> 01:06:24.660
closer to it so in some senses it's different than like post-modernist philosophy that says

01:06:24.660 --> 01:06:31.380
there is no objective truth there is an objective truth um uh but we can never know it but we can

01:06:31.380 --> 01:06:38.100
get closer to it uh so once Papa understood that knowledge the knowledge generating mechanism behind

01:06:38.100 --> 01:06:42.660
science success was conjecturing refutation he realized that human learning which begins at

01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:47.620
birth and continues to death uses the same problem solving algorithm although the developmental

01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:53.300
psychology literature called the method trial and error so because life is constantly presenting

01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:57.140
us with new challenges such as the need to get from one place to another a problem that inspires

01:06:57.220 --> 01:07:02.180
babies to learn to walk we must constantly try out new behavioral solutions we can think of these

01:07:02.180 --> 01:07:07.380
actions as guesses about how to survive or if you prefer experiments innovating equilibrium or

01:07:07.380 --> 01:07:17.220
predictions for persistence and they will often fail um so this is Dan Dennett's idea of life

01:07:17.220 --> 01:07:21.060
exploring this design space we're going to talk about how it does so through evolution but we're

01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:25.140
still talking about science here and adaptive learning on an abstract level we can imagine

01:07:25.140 --> 01:07:29.220
a certain practical problem as a challenge one with the solution that exists somewhere out there

01:07:29.220 --> 01:07:33.220
in the space of possibilities just waiting to be found by someone's sufficiently motivated and

01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:38.980
clever it may take some time but if the possibility space the space of possible solutions is continuously

01:07:38.980 --> 01:07:45.540
explored in an efficient way eventually a solution will be discovered so excuse me trial and error

01:07:45.540 --> 01:07:54.820
learning explores the solution space um so just to give you a clear example of how adaptive

01:07:54.820 --> 01:08:01.060
learning uh is kind of this form of hypothesis testing so whenever we have a problem in life and

01:08:01.060 --> 01:08:06.420
we don't know the correct solution to a problem in advance um we naturally begin with those potential

01:08:06.420 --> 01:08:11.620
solutions that are closer to our starting point in the solution space for sampling so for example

01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:16.980
if a baby reaches for its bottle and barely misses it'll adjust its behavior slightly which minimizes

01:08:16.980 --> 01:08:24.660
the chances of making an error um so our instincts may nudges in the general direction of a solution

01:08:24.740 --> 01:08:31.700
but the instinct alone is not enough uh we have to try out what you could call a behavioral

01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:39.700
conjecture and when it fails uh we try something new so that's kind of like a new theory and uh

01:08:39.700 --> 01:08:45.620
it's essentially the old one but with a little twist and if that behavioral solution is remembered

01:08:45.620 --> 01:08:53.140
then it's gets stored for future use ready to be repeated but also adapted if necessary um

01:08:53.780 --> 01:09:00.340
but in humans so the baby example reaching for the bottle let's say it misses the bottle it

01:09:00.340 --> 01:09:05.380
won't get a reward signal it won't get a little surge of dopamine so if it corrects and it gets

01:09:05.380 --> 01:09:11.220
closer it gets a little reward signal this is reinforcement learning but basically this adaptive

01:09:11.220 --> 01:09:18.260
learning process is a process of making theories and eliminating those theories that are errors

01:09:18.340 --> 01:09:30.660
so uh popper saw that scientific knowledge and the evolutionary process uh were also connected so

01:09:30.660 --> 01:09:37.940
not only is science uh adaptive learning uh both of those things are extensions of the

01:09:37.940 --> 01:09:43.140
evolutionary process so he says in science theories are highly competitive we discuss them

01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:46.900
critically we test them and we eliminate the series which we judge to be less good in solving

01:09:46.900 --> 01:09:51.220
the problems which we wish to solve so only that's theories those which are most fit survive in

01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:56.580
the struggle this is the way science grows um so that's kind of nice like showing you

01:09:57.220 --> 01:10:03.780
really how this is an evolutionary process um not only a science and evolutionary process

01:10:03.780 --> 01:10:11.380
the converse is true evolution is a scientific process so it is clear this is another quote

01:10:11.380 --> 01:10:15.380
it is clear that this view of the progress of science is very similar to darwin's view of

01:10:15.380 --> 01:10:20.500
natural selection by the way of the elimination of the unfit of the errors in the evolution of

01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:26.100
life the errors in the attempts at adaptation which is a trial and error process analogously

01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:34.260
science works by trial theory making and by the elimination of errors um i might pause in a second

01:10:34.260 --> 01:10:42.020
just to um see if everybody understands this but i have a few more slides so um evolutionary

01:10:42.020 --> 01:10:50.100
algorithms uh also use this mechanism but it's called generate and test so i didn't mention this uh

01:10:50.100 --> 01:10:56.500
the mechanism of evolution is variation and selection so we have these algorithms that are

01:10:56.500 --> 01:11:01.700
equivalent conjecture and error mutation trial and error variation and selection we also have

01:11:01.700 --> 01:11:10.260
generated test so in machine learning evolutionary algorithms uh have this method uh generating

01:11:10.340 --> 01:11:15.700
tests um possible solutions are generated into an actual solution is found and these

01:11:15.700 --> 01:11:19.300
solutions accumulate in some memory store while the errors are filtered out and forgotten

01:11:20.340 --> 01:11:24.020
in science the solutions are theories or models that actually predict some natural phenomena

01:11:24.660 --> 01:11:30.820
and the successful full ones accumulate in peer review journals and textbooks so um

01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:35.940
we see that these processes are equivalent and we're actually going to see that it's this

01:11:35.940 --> 01:11:44.500
Bayesian process uh that adaptation is also a process of uh the model of the organism

01:11:45.220 --> 01:11:50.980
becoming optimized uh decreasing its prediction error so that it can more efficiently extract

01:11:50.980 --> 01:12:01.140
free energy from an itch to stay ordered so we get this principle um that all evolutionary

01:12:01.140 --> 01:12:07.620
processes are learning processes and all learning processes are evolutionary processes um Conrad

01:12:07.620 --> 01:12:14.980
Lorenz a Nobel Prize winning zoologist was also a pioneer of evolutionary epistemology and he made

01:12:14.980 --> 01:12:22.900
the statement life is a cognitive process um so if this is true and there's this functional

01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:27.780
equivalence between the mechanisms driving evolution learning and science then that implies

01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:36.420
that adaptation uh or the genetic information that um uh corresponds to those physical adaptations

01:12:37.060 --> 01:12:43.140
are uh equivalent is equivalent to scientific knowledge they're actually the same thing so

01:12:43.940 --> 01:12:49.460
to kind of make this relationship clear biological adaptation represents knowledge

01:12:49.460 --> 01:12:53.220
of the environment and the knowledge we acquire through learning and science reflects adaptation

01:12:53.220 --> 01:12:57.860
to the environment so we see that there's no meaningful distinction between adaptive information

01:12:57.860 --> 01:13:01.540
and scientific knowledge both allow life to predict an uncertain world control matter

01:13:01.540 --> 01:13:07.300
constrained chaos and we construct order from disorder so the very same property that is responsible

01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:14.660
for organic matter leaving the planet in spaceships so this anti-accretion uh is the same uh property

01:13:14.660 --> 01:13:21.460
that allows organisms to climb uphill seemingly defying the force of gravity of course uh the laws

01:13:21.460 --> 01:13:28.660
of physics aren't violated in any way but uh living systems are not constrained by the laws

01:13:28.660 --> 01:13:36.260
of physics through a inanimate systems are so some examples a dolphin stream modern design

01:13:36.260 --> 01:13:41.380
which is a product of the information stored in its genome contains the knowledge of hydrodynamics

01:13:41.940 --> 01:13:46.500
an eagle's wing design contains the knowledge of aerodynamics not only can we be certain that

01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:51.540
engineers see knowledge in these functional structures uh there should be little doubt that

01:13:51.540 --> 01:13:58.180
they inspired uh our machines and and without that information I don't think we would have come to

01:13:58.180 --> 01:14:07.540
those inventions at least not any time soon um camouflage uh on an organism uh represents

01:14:07.540 --> 01:14:15.860
knowledge of the environment so kind of bridging this idea of evolutionary epistemology that

01:14:15.860 --> 01:14:21.940
evolution builds up knowledge and that science is an extension of the evolutionary process uh

01:14:22.740 --> 01:14:30.580
making a bridge between that and Bayesian inference uh requires this uh relationship between adaptation

01:14:30.580 --> 01:14:36.900
and statistical correlation so physicist Carlo Revelli which who has gotten really interested

01:14:36.900 --> 01:14:44.180
in explaining how this information that underlies agency that behavior that we see with living

01:14:44.180 --> 01:14:51.540
systems gets built up through evolution uh he wrote a great essay it won the foundational

01:14:51.540 --> 01:14:59.700
questions institute essay contest um a few years ago but this work was based on the work of David

01:14:59.700 --> 01:15:09.300
Wolpert and Artem Kolchinski Artem Kolchinski and basically shows how this adaptation builds up

01:15:09.300 --> 01:15:14.580
information in the system that information is really statistical correlation between

01:15:14.580 --> 01:15:20.420
the organism and its environment so here's the simplest example it's a bacterium performing

01:15:20.420 --> 01:15:28.900
chemotaxis um so bacteria so chemotaxis is basically uh a bacterium will uh swim in the

01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:35.460
direction of food and swim away from toxins so basically it's detecting this chemical gradient

01:15:35.540 --> 01:15:42.820
that it follows um but so we can see in this example um and this isn't the case for all

01:15:43.380 --> 01:15:47.780
species but you can imagine that a bacterium that swims to the left when nutrients are on the left

01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:59.540
uh prosperous compared to a bacterium that swims at random um so uh with this behavior

01:15:59.540 --> 01:16:06.340
where it's swimming towards food um that is the product of a chance mutation so it's in some sense

01:16:06.340 --> 01:16:13.780
it's an accident but when it discovers that solution that organism is more likely to reproduce

01:16:14.580 --> 01:16:21.860
so that solution gets retained in the population it gets sort of frozen hardwired in and um

01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:29.300
so the process of adaptation is a process that builds up a statistical correlation between

01:16:29.940 --> 01:16:38.180
the system the agent and its environment and so that shared correlation represents

01:16:38.180 --> 01:16:43.780
mutual information so mutual information is information that's shared between the environment

01:16:43.780 --> 01:16:53.700
and the organism and uh just to explain that a little bit more uh this correlation uh basically

01:16:53.700 --> 01:17:00.820
as this correlation gets built up it's creating predictive knowledge so um John Maynard Smith

01:17:00.820 --> 01:17:07.060
cites Fred Dretsky who did kind of the pioneering work applying Shannon's information theory to

01:17:07.060 --> 01:17:12.660
try to quantify evolution so Dretsky argues that if some variable a is correlated with the

01:17:12.660 --> 01:17:17.540
second variable b then we can say that b carries information about a for example if the occurrence

01:17:17.540 --> 01:17:21.700
of rain is correlated with a particular cloud then the type of cloud tells us whether it would

01:17:21.700 --> 01:17:28.660
rain so that's from a great essay called the concept of information biology um so we can see

01:17:29.620 --> 01:17:36.980
that you have this little rhyming equation here adaptation equals statistical correlation

01:17:37.060 --> 01:17:44.980
equals mutual information and because that uh shared information allows the organism to predict

01:17:44.980 --> 01:17:51.140
its environment better this process is also a process of model optimization so the predictive

01:17:51.140 --> 01:17:59.860
model of the organism as it adapts starts to become more accurate and so this whole process can be

01:17:59.860 --> 01:18:07.940
seen as a free energy minimization process um of course that's information theoretic free energy

01:18:07.940 --> 01:18:12.740
it's the free energy of first instance principle we're not talking about thermodynamic free energy

01:18:12.740 --> 01:18:20.340
anyone wants to ask a question or gets confused about that let me know but it's basically uh those

01:18:20.340 --> 01:18:26.580
things are related and it's something that's not mentioned enough uh minimizing information

01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:33.140
theoretic free energy which is just minimizing the prediction error of your model is what allows

01:18:33.140 --> 01:18:40.660
the organism to minimize environmental free energy so by acquiring information reducing

01:18:41.780 --> 01:18:48.820
the information theoretic free energy allows the organism to extract energy and reduce

01:18:49.460 --> 01:18:54.420
thermodynamic free energy it minimizes the free energy and the environment converts it into entropy

01:18:57.140 --> 01:19:04.020
so we kind of see how this it's getting into universal Bayesianism as it becomes more correlated

01:19:04.020 --> 01:19:09.620
it gains information about its niche and therefore becomes a better predictor of that niche um

01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:15.540
so that's what adaptation is it's the genome of the species accumulating information that reduces

01:19:15.540 --> 01:19:24.660
the average organism's uncertainty regarding the environment so um the genome is a knowledge

01:19:24.740 --> 01:19:30.580
repository of solutions to environmental challenges that allows an organism with no brain and no

01:19:30.580 --> 01:19:35.860
mind to anticipate events in the environment so in this theory as I mentioned before consciousness

01:19:35.860 --> 01:19:44.340
comes later it comes with self-modeling capacity and a bacterium would be kind of a zombie agent

01:19:44.340 --> 01:19:51.060
it would have agency and it would move with purpose but that is not enough for mind or at

01:19:51.060 --> 01:19:58.180
least mind defined as consciousness uh if you want to say that mind is just information processing

01:19:58.180 --> 01:20:03.540
then yes there is mind in these systems but that's very different than saying that the system has a

01:20:03.540 --> 01:20:09.140
subjective experience uh in a first person perspective that will come in the next talk but

01:20:09.140 --> 01:20:17.060
that uh it's it's harder um so that information stored in memory is integrated into a statistical

01:20:17.060 --> 01:20:22.580
or predictive model that determines the causal control system's behavioral repertoire or the full

01:20:22.580 --> 01:20:27.940
range of behaviors an organism is capable of and it is this mapping of sensory inputs to motor

01:20:27.940 --> 01:20:32.900
outputs that makes the organism move in ways that we normally associate with mind or consciousness

01:20:33.780 --> 01:20:39.300
um crawlferston in a great eon article says all biological processes can be construed as

01:20:39.300 --> 01:20:44.820
performing some form of inference I think I already read that um but the free energy principle

01:20:44.820 --> 01:20:51.540
for those aren't familiar um we've already explained it but the Bayesian brain hypothesis

01:20:52.100 --> 01:20:57.140
and the free energy principle are the same thing uh the difference is that the free energy principle

01:20:57.140 --> 01:21:02.820
applies to all other adaptive systems where the other one is just focusing on brains but

01:21:03.460 --> 01:21:10.820
friston realized that this you know is a model and a process that applies to any system that's

01:21:10.820 --> 01:21:17.140
trying to resist the tendency towards disorder so any system to stay to continue persisting

01:21:17.140 --> 01:21:23.620
longer than we would expect uh naturally it must engage in Bayesian like learning to deal with

01:21:23.620 --> 01:21:33.300
environment uncertainty how much time do I have left roughly uh still more than enough

01:21:34.020 --> 01:21:40.420
okay keep going um I'm definitely more than half through I'd say I'm two-thirds of the way through

01:21:41.060 --> 01:21:47.380
so uh John Campbell has this great uh paper called universal Darwinism as a process of

01:21:47.380 --> 01:21:53.620
Bayesian inference that I kept coming across as I was trying to understand uh non-equilibrium

01:21:53.620 --> 01:22:00.500
thermodynamics and information theory um yeah I should say actually I should have

01:22:00.500 --> 01:22:06.020
got in the books uh showed you each book but um there's a great book called the origin and nature

01:22:06.020 --> 01:22:11.780
of life on earth by uh Santa Fe Institute's Eric Smith and Harold Morowitz uh Morowitz was a professor

01:22:11.780 --> 01:22:19.220
of mine Eric uh is a friend that uh we would have these foundations of the mine uh guild it was

01:22:19.220 --> 01:22:26.660
like a consciousness club that would meet at the Krasnow Institute where I got my PhD and um so their

01:22:26.660 --> 01:22:33.620
book the origin of life on the origin of life in chapter eight actually gets into this information

01:22:33.620 --> 01:22:39.460
theory and uh this this Bayesian inference and describes the origin of life and the evolution

01:22:40.020 --> 01:22:47.140
of life as a process of Bayesian model selection and so that was kind of what connected

01:22:47.140 --> 01:22:51.380
non-equilibrium statistical mechanics to these to this Bayesian brain hypothesis

01:22:52.100 --> 01:22:58.500
and I realized that you know these theories were kind of converging on the same ideas so

01:22:58.500 --> 01:23:03.620
John Campbell wrote this paper in 2016 he says Bayesian inference is an algorithm for the accumulation

01:23:03.620 --> 01:23:08.980
of evidence-based knowledge this algorithm is now seen to operate over a wide range of evolutionary

01:23:08.980 --> 01:23:13.380
processes including natural selection the evolution of mental models and cultural evolutionary

01:23:13.380 --> 01:23:22.260
processes notably including science itself so uh when we say that evolution is a process of

01:23:22.260 --> 01:23:27.540
Bayesian model selection in the book I mentioned with Eric and Morowitz actually characterized

01:23:27.540 --> 01:23:34.980
evolution as an inference engine uh we're basically saying that when organisms that aren't fit get

01:23:34.980 --> 01:23:43.540
weeded out uh that's basically models that aren't predictive getting eliminated so the organisms

01:23:43.540 --> 01:23:49.940
that persist are the models that were able to predict the environment best so inference and

01:23:49.940 --> 01:23:57.220
prediction are kind of the same thing uh since the word inference is a little obscure I guess um so

01:23:57.300 --> 01:24:06.100
just to make this point a little more clear um since nature is complex and intrinsically unpredictable

01:24:06.100 --> 01:24:12.820
uh the model of an organism is at some point guaranteed to fail when reality surprises it

01:24:12.820 --> 01:24:20.420
with the unexpected so and that's what the free energy principle is about minimizing surprise is

01:24:20.420 --> 01:24:26.660
the same thing as minimizing prediction error so an organism gets eaten by a predator a baby

01:24:26.660 --> 01:24:35.060
fails to reach his bottle a scientific theory fails to explain new data um basically when any of

01:24:35.060 --> 01:24:38.580
these things happens it means that the model used to predict reality is not completely accurate

01:24:39.220 --> 01:24:43.140
it contains a certain amount of prediction error needs to be corrected so what's the solution

01:24:43.140 --> 01:24:47.300
try something new the old model worked well enough up to that point so don't ditch it just

01:24:47.300 --> 01:24:52.020
vary it a bit and see if it performs better if it does not reduce surprise eliminate that variant

01:24:52.020 --> 01:24:56.020
and try again if prediction error is reduced replace the old model with the new one so that

01:24:56.020 --> 01:24:59.460
it becomes the reigning theory and the design template for new variants to be based upon

01:25:00.500 --> 01:25:04.740
when a model has been updated in this way due to natural selection adaptive learning or

01:25:04.740 --> 01:25:09.620
experimental testing we can say that knowledge has been acquired and environmental uncertainty reduced

01:25:11.540 --> 01:25:18.580
so here we have an image um I should say that uh infinity maps uh German software mapping company

01:25:19.220 --> 01:25:26.500
helped me create these images uh Oliver Wan I have to uh do a big thanks to him um this image

01:25:26.500 --> 01:25:33.540
has a little bit more going on than I would want right now but you could see that um basically

01:25:35.220 --> 01:25:43.140
this represents two different mechanisms for uh learning and adaptation so this one on the top

01:25:43.140 --> 01:25:49.140
that we're going to talk about first is the normal uh competitive evolution sort of Darwinian

01:25:49.140 --> 01:25:55.540
survival of the fittest while this mechanism over here is the mechanism of self-organization

01:25:56.740 --> 01:26:03.620
so let's first talk about the normal type of evolution we're familiar with and show that

01:26:04.500 --> 01:26:10.100
how this process of evolution that works through variation and selection actually

01:26:10.500 --> 01:26:22.420
uh generates predictive information and uh creates a model which is uh which encodes knowledge

01:26:22.420 --> 01:26:29.140
of the biologically relevant regularities in the environment so first we have this

01:26:30.020 --> 01:26:38.580
this is a bacterium over here and so this is the simplest model um you have an organism

01:26:38.580 --> 01:26:43.060
that's an embodied theory or a best guess about how to stay far from equilibrium

01:26:43.060 --> 01:26:50.580
so evolutionary epistemology sees organisms themselves as embodied theories so evolution

01:26:50.580 --> 01:27:00.020
is basically testing these different models so uh it basically reproduces and we know that

01:27:00.020 --> 01:27:09.860
because there are going to be errors in uh in that process uh the genome will get changed

01:27:11.620 --> 01:27:18.980
slightly and you will get a generation of progeny that all are slightly different

01:27:19.540 --> 01:27:24.660
they have slightly different configurations um some of these configurations will be better

01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:29.220
at extracting energy and predicting the environment than others and the ones that uh

01:27:30.420 --> 01:27:34.020
aren't good at predicting the environment they get filtered out by natural selection

01:27:34.740 --> 01:27:39.940
so here we see design four is the winning design because it's the best predictor and it's the best

01:27:39.940 --> 01:27:50.340
predictor because it's the best extractor of energy and so that uh design uh that that organism

01:27:50.340 --> 01:27:56.820
gets to reproduce and then you have another generation uh of designs that are slightly

01:27:56.820 --> 01:28:03.700
different and this process is an iterative process just like science and hypothesis testing so

01:28:04.740 --> 01:28:12.900
over generations you will start to get uh designs that are better adapted to the environment

01:28:13.940 --> 01:28:19.620
which we've explained means that they will be more correlated with the environment

01:28:20.740 --> 01:28:29.300
and being more correlated means being a better predictor um so the knowledge that's left over

01:28:29.300 --> 01:28:34.420
after this process is the adaptive information stored in genetic material that reduces

01:28:34.420 --> 01:28:40.100
environmental uncertainty and you see that this process will ultimately lead to the evolution

01:28:40.740 --> 01:28:45.780
towards the the best possible design so it's it's an optimization a lot of people don't think

01:28:46.580 --> 01:28:51.380
that evolution is optimizing anything there's been this you know kind of philosophy that

01:28:51.380 --> 01:28:57.860
evolution does just good enough but we actually see that in terms of the computation that it

01:28:57.860 --> 01:29:05.300
does to stay far from equilibrium that it's actually optimized for being almost maximally

01:29:05.300 --> 01:29:09.860
efficient with its use of energy it approaches something close to what's called the land hour

01:29:09.860 --> 01:29:17.780
limit which david will put at sfi is written about but uh life is much more efficient uh

01:29:17.780 --> 01:29:24.420
with computation in terms of energy uh supply needed compared to all of our technology so the

01:29:24.420 --> 01:29:31.060
human brain can do uh solve problems that even our bests like ai systems can't solve and it does

01:29:31.060 --> 01:29:38.660
so running on uh the equivalent of one household light bulb so we'll come back to this self

01:29:38.660 --> 01:29:46.740
organization process oh well actually we'll get into that right now so this is the normal uh

01:29:46.740 --> 01:29:51.940
process that we think about when we think about evolution generating knowledge predictive knowledge

01:29:53.060 --> 01:29:59.540
and so that's called phylogenetic learning uh phylogenetic refers to these like generations so

01:29:59.540 --> 01:30:04.740
the learning is generational the organisms don't really learn because they don't have brains they

01:30:04.740 --> 01:30:10.020
not able to update their model in real time so learning is at the level of the population

01:30:11.060 --> 01:30:18.340
and for learning to occur organisms have to die before brains basically you have to have this uh

01:30:18.340 --> 01:30:27.460
competition uh for there to be a learning process however there's also self organization when these

01:30:27.460 --> 01:30:33.140
organisms don't compete but actually find a configuration find it discover a collective

01:30:33.140 --> 01:30:39.540
configuration through their somewhat random interactions with each other and when they

01:30:39.540 --> 01:30:46.980
find this collective configuration through trial and error um basically the configurations

01:30:46.980 --> 01:30:54.260
that are better at extracting energy will be the ones that are retained um so

01:30:54.500 --> 01:31:04.020
Donald Campbell father of evolutionary epistemology uh explain this process this evolutionary process

01:31:04.820 --> 01:31:09.700
by which self organization works as blind variation and selective retention

01:31:10.340 --> 01:31:16.900
or we can think of it as selection for persistence or stability so fitness kind of there's a

01:31:16.900 --> 01:31:23.220
Dawkins quote I think I come out where Richard Dawkins said Darwin's uh survival of the fittest

01:31:23.220 --> 01:31:31.140
is really um just uh more specific instance of a more general law of survival of the stable

01:31:32.020 --> 01:31:39.620
so when we think about being fit at the beginning we're talking about just being uh stable being

01:31:39.620 --> 01:31:44.820
able to find energy if you can't do that it doesn't matter whether you have agents that you're

01:31:44.820 --> 01:31:50.020
competing with or not because if you can't get energy it doesn't matter if there are other people

01:31:50.020 --> 01:31:58.500
competing for it that you won't survive so you don't need replication with variation to evolve

01:31:58.500 --> 01:32:03.940
that's what this is this model is saying um and Stuart Kauffman from the Santa Fe Institute has

01:32:04.740 --> 01:32:09.060
been talking about the importance of this marriage between Darwinian evolution and

01:32:09.060 --> 01:32:18.100
self-organization but basically uh because there's not this replication process um this is how

01:32:18.100 --> 01:32:25.860
evolution occurs so you have a system that's a collection of components parts these parts can be

01:32:25.860 --> 01:32:33.700
molecules or they could be agents and when these molecules are pushed far from equilibrium by a

01:32:33.700 --> 01:32:38.820
flow of energy of course humans are eating food and metabolizing energy so they're being powered

01:32:38.820 --> 01:32:45.140
by energy flows as well the system blindly explores various configurations in the space of

01:32:45.140 --> 01:32:52.420
possible designs via trial and error so this system will move through a series of configurations

01:32:52.420 --> 01:32:58.980
and those configurations that allow the system to extract sufficient energy to stay out of equilibrium

01:32:58.980 --> 01:33:05.860
will get retained while the configurations that don't allow for energy extraction will

01:33:05.860 --> 01:33:11.700
will get filtered out either the system will collapse and have to try a new configuration um

01:33:12.580 --> 01:33:19.460
or it'll just revert to the the previous stable uh configuration and it will continue

01:33:20.180 --> 01:33:27.540
trying to explore that configuration space um I should have said like here's a good example

01:33:27.540 --> 01:33:33.140
like here's a depiction of this configuration space we're talking about life exploring the design

01:33:33.140 --> 01:33:42.740
space so basically you have a designer configuration and then uh you get these uh different this

01:33:42.740 --> 01:33:49.620
exploration of different configurations that are very close to the configuration you started out with

01:33:51.380 --> 01:33:57.860
so you know I was thinking about giving a talk on the origin of life but I couldn't get into all

01:33:57.860 --> 01:34:02.340
this cool Bayesian stuff that's what the first part of the book is about what's really interesting

01:34:02.340 --> 01:34:07.460
is that we're finding that self-organization as mentioned is a Darwinian process so there's actually

01:34:07.460 --> 01:34:13.060
a name for this dissipative adaptation and it shows that this evolution towards these more

01:34:13.060 --> 01:34:18.340
stable configurations dissipate more energy when this happens at the level of organisms that we're

01:34:18.340 --> 01:34:24.500
talking about it shouldn't be surprising that it dissipates more energy because basically

01:34:25.220 --> 01:34:31.460
as the organism evolves to be better at extracting energy all that energy it's extracting to maintain

01:34:31.460 --> 01:34:38.500
far from equilibrium is being converted into thermal entropy so all self-organizing processes

01:34:38.500 --> 01:34:45.540
are really dissipative adaptation processes at different levels so this process philosophers

01:34:45.540 --> 01:34:51.780
would say is multiply realizable so this process can happen at different scales and that's exactly

01:34:51.780 --> 01:34:58.740
what we see like right here the same process so you would have like a society like exploring

01:34:58.740 --> 01:35:03.460
different governance systems and it doesn't know which government system is going to work

01:35:04.020 --> 01:35:10.020
the best the forehand it tries it if it doesn't work well like the fall of Rome

01:35:11.540 --> 01:35:13.940
it will collapse and then it will reassemble

01:35:17.460 --> 01:35:17.780
so

01:35:22.020 --> 01:35:27.700
just to wrap up the origin of life so we have this process of dissipative adaptation and if it's

01:35:27.700 --> 01:35:32.900
being pushed by the flow of energy and it's doing this process here where it's finding increasingly

01:35:34.100 --> 01:35:38.420
stable configurations collective configurations then

01:35:41.860 --> 01:35:46.820
basically what will emerge is an autocatalytic set we'll define that later but basically

01:35:47.940 --> 01:35:52.020
it's I'm losing a lot of terms from philosophy I was going to say like and

01:35:52.020 --> 01:35:55.940
it's the beginning of an auto poetic agent so like a self-maintaining agent

01:35:56.740 --> 01:36:01.860
and simplest form is a chemical system that produces outputs which are then

01:36:02.420 --> 01:36:08.900
fed back into the system so that the system can self-amplify it's basically creating

01:36:09.700 --> 01:36:16.340
all of the molecules that it needs to grow and it's thought that this process

01:36:17.220 --> 01:36:23.940
you know occurred the autocatalytic set is kind of the precursor for the first cell

01:36:24.020 --> 01:36:31.140
so it's kind of like a proto cell and it was thought to occur around hydrothermal vents which

01:36:31.140 --> 01:36:39.060
are underwater volcanoes there's all this energy flowing up from the the the hot core running

01:36:39.060 --> 01:36:46.180
through geochemical energy and there's these rocky pores in the rocks around hydrothermal vents which

01:36:47.300 --> 01:36:50.340
provides something like a membrane like a lipid

01:36:50.980 --> 01:36:55.220
membrane to hold the components in a Markov blanket so the the pores in the rocks

01:36:55.780 --> 01:37:01.700
were the Markov blanket for the autocatalytic set and Eric Smith and Morowitz showed that

01:37:02.500 --> 01:37:10.260
basically feeding off inorganic inputs like carbon molecules like not anything

01:37:10.260 --> 01:37:16.900
not organic chemistry where it's like life but just like simple like carbon hydrogen and oxygen

01:37:16.900 --> 01:37:26.420
feeding off those inputs basically the metabolic process it's called the reverse grab cycle so

01:37:27.860 --> 01:37:38.820
that process allowed the first autocatalytic set to continuously self-amplify through this

01:37:38.820 --> 01:37:44.820
through this process so if this process is allowed to continue further self-organization

01:37:44.820 --> 01:37:48.660
may eventually lead to the emergence of an organic computer that can process integrate and

01:37:48.660 --> 01:37:56.340
store information about the world so what dissipative adaptation is doing is uh as it's doing this

01:37:56.340 --> 01:38:01.700
blind variation and selective retention process and it's finding more stable configurations

01:38:02.260 --> 01:38:08.260
those more stable configurations are also predictive of the environment so this dissipative

01:38:08.260 --> 01:38:16.580
adaptation process is this autocatalytic set modeling the surrounding energy landscape so

01:38:16.580 --> 01:38:22.180
i'm arguing that this is where modeling begins it even begins before what we call life like

01:38:22.180 --> 01:38:28.420
self replicating life and it's dissipative adaptation which is a process of modeling the

01:38:28.420 --> 01:38:37.700
the energy in the environment the energy sources um so uh this isn't just one continuous process

01:38:37.700 --> 01:38:43.300
there are these leaps that are phase transitions basically we've heard of phase transitions and

01:38:44.500 --> 01:38:48.660
physics and chemistry courses where you have like

01:38:51.380 --> 01:38:58.740
water being heated up and then transitioning into a gas or the reverse when a gas becomes frozen

01:38:59.380 --> 01:39:09.700
uh you get a state of order that emerges um these transitions towards uh these configurations

01:39:09.700 --> 01:39:17.060
that are good at extracting energy those uh have also been characterized as phase transitions

01:39:17.060 --> 01:39:21.300
so eric smith who i mentioned before and Harold Morowitz they have this phase transition theory

01:39:21.300 --> 01:39:30.660
of life which basically uh explains how um information gains control in these systems

01:39:33.140 --> 01:39:37.140
and sarah walker and paul davies work on this basically show that through this process

01:39:37.780 --> 01:39:42.420
the blind variation and selective retention information gets built up in this autocatalytic

01:39:42.420 --> 01:39:49.700
set and at some point there's what they call algorithmic takeover uh or informational control

01:39:49.700 --> 01:39:56.900
and the system becomes an agent that can start to steer and control itself uh in ways that wouldn't

01:39:56.900 --> 01:40:03.220
be predicted by physics so a living system is very much like we didn't talk about dissipative

01:40:03.220 --> 01:40:09.380
structures but like tornadoes warples those things emerge to dissipate an energy gradient

01:40:11.140 --> 01:40:18.580
living things uh because of the process of metabolism we are this cycling system this

01:40:18.660 --> 01:40:27.060
thermodynamic energetic loop um uh but uh what's it gonna say about that um

01:40:30.500 --> 01:40:36.260
so yeah we are like the storm but we do have control over the storm we're a storm with control

01:40:36.260 --> 01:40:41.140
so it doesn't really make sense going back to sam harris's quote that you are the storm you do

01:40:41.140 --> 01:40:47.060
not control it it's literally the information that gets built up through evolution that allows

01:40:47.940 --> 01:40:54.340
you know us being this dissipative structure like a storm to start controlling its own behavior

01:40:57.460 --> 01:41:06.340
um so the last part is just an argument for that second question why should complexity increase

01:41:07.060 --> 01:41:12.180
um we know that this evolutionary process where you build up this model

01:41:12.580 --> 01:41:18.660
uh so we would think that this after these generations of evolution this organism is

01:41:18.660 --> 01:41:25.460
going to be well adapted to its environment but we know that adaptation doesn't mean becoming

01:41:25.460 --> 01:41:32.820
more complex always so sharks and crocodiles are cited as species that haven't evolved much at all

01:41:33.380 --> 01:41:41.700
in many millions of years um cave fish actually evolved to become more simple so basically fish

01:41:41.700 --> 01:41:48.980
with eyes got isolated in like an underground environment where there was no uh need for

01:41:48.980 --> 01:41:59.700
sunlight and uh so basically um fish like processing light like eyes didn't have any

01:41:59.700 --> 01:42:07.780
survival advantage so um basically fish lost their eyes uh over many generations of evolution

01:42:07.780 --> 01:42:16.180
becoming simpler so if that's true why should evolution increase complexity um the answer to

01:42:16.180 --> 01:42:21.780
that it comes from this understanding that evolutionary epistemology says that a species

01:42:21.780 --> 01:42:27.460
adapting to a niche is like a scientific theory being tested for viability the species will evolve

01:42:27.460 --> 01:42:34.100
not to become increasingly complex but to match the complexity of the environment a sort of simplest

01:42:34.100 --> 01:42:40.020
solution to the thermodynamic problem of staying far from equilibrium so i'm signed famous we said

01:42:40.020 --> 01:42:46.420
a theory should be as simple as possible but no simpler the same could be said about an organism

01:42:46.420 --> 01:42:54.100
you want it to be as simple as possible while it accomplishes its task of extracting energy

01:42:54.100 --> 01:43:00.500
it has to be complex enough to be able to extract energy in a competitive environment

01:43:01.220 --> 01:43:07.700
but a bacterium doesn't have to do it doesn't need intelligence any extra information processing

01:43:07.700 --> 01:43:16.820
higher level cognition would be energy wasted um that could be energy that allows it to stay

01:43:16.820 --> 01:43:23.700
far from equilibrium for longer and replicate more so um it's not the case that everything

01:43:23.700 --> 01:43:30.820
will evolve towards higher complexity uh but the reason that we do get increasingly complex

01:43:30.820 --> 01:43:37.380
species over evolutionary time in a way that i'm saying is inevitable uh so there is a progressive

01:43:37.380 --> 01:43:44.820
evolutionary process that leads to higher forms it has to do with uh niche emergence so so basically

01:43:45.620 --> 01:43:50.740
a species will evolve to become as complex as its niche as its environmental niche

01:43:51.220 --> 01:44:00.020
but there will be increasingly complex niches that emerge uh for reasons that will be explained

01:44:00.020 --> 01:44:07.620
um but i will pause there uh before i get to that which will be what we end on

01:44:10.180 --> 01:44:15.460
there are no other questions right now so if anyone does have questions how about they can

01:44:15.460 --> 01:44:22.500
feel free to ask it during this last section give you a second to catch your breath i know it's been

01:44:22.500 --> 01:44:29.140
a ton of information like my goal is that you know since this is being recorded it'll be something

01:44:29.140 --> 01:44:36.660
that's up um hopefully i've cited enough literature that people can explore this stuff themselves

01:44:36.660 --> 01:44:42.180
and see that like okay it's not this guy that's like uh coo claiming to have like a theory of

01:44:42.180 --> 01:44:50.100
everything this isn't my theory it's a synthesis that's emerging and um uh really the story has

01:44:50.100 --> 01:44:58.100
been there for quite some time and the cybernetics pioneers actually a lot of them were you could call

01:44:58.100 --> 01:45:03.700
them like cosmic teleologists a lot of them did see this continual increase in complexity

01:45:04.500 --> 01:45:09.940
of course there's nothing mystical about it or supernatural about it um it's a mechanistic

01:45:09.940 --> 01:45:17.300
process that doesn't change the fact that nature seems to have these built-in goals that emerge from

01:45:18.260 --> 01:45:25.060
the fundamental laws and constants the parameters the fine-tuning um but it's a completely natural

01:45:25.060 --> 01:45:32.180
progressive teleological evolutionary process and so i'll just end you know this is just

01:45:33.300 --> 01:45:38.020
finishing up it's along the same line so that's good questions can come after this

01:45:38.020 --> 01:45:47.380
i know it's been quite a lot so i will just try to sum this up simply um so uh two important

01:45:47.380 --> 01:45:53.700
principles from cybernetics these came from ross ashby who also created the principle of

01:45:53.700 --> 01:45:59.300
self-organization which was really the first time people took self-organization seriously so

01:46:00.340 --> 01:46:04.420
we think of complexity science as being the science of self-organization but it really

01:46:04.420 --> 01:46:10.660
goes back to cybernetics um i think the term i think khan might have talked about it but it was

01:46:11.220 --> 01:46:17.220
ross ashby who tried to you know give it a make it a a principle and a formalized concept

01:46:18.340 --> 01:46:24.500
so there are these two concepts that really i think anybody interested in like carl firston's

01:46:24.500 --> 01:46:29.860
basing brain hypothesis free energy principle should be aware of because all of the way he talks

01:46:29.860 --> 01:46:39.060
about like evolution comes from this ashby's work um the good regulator theorem it was also

01:46:39.060 --> 01:46:43.860
updated there there was the internal model principle which came like a decade later good

01:46:43.860 --> 01:46:49.860
regulator theorem came these both these laws i think came in the 50s and the 40s or 50s and then

01:46:49.860 --> 01:46:54.500
i think in the 70s the internal model principle was created but it basically says that any system

01:46:54.500 --> 01:47:00.420
that regulates or controls another system must have a model of that system otherwise it can't

01:47:00.420 --> 01:47:06.980
regulate it so it seems pretty obvious but this talk of models kind of starts here that that is

01:47:06.980 --> 01:47:15.860
very familiar to like anyone interested in like the free energy principle so this this can be applied

01:47:15.860 --> 01:47:22.660
to inanimate systems i mean controllers are like house like thermostats and stuff but ashby was

01:47:22.660 --> 01:47:27.220
really interested in adaptive systems so he was thinking about evolution so applied to evolution

01:47:27.780 --> 01:47:34.580
an organism must model its environment uh if it's going to extract free energy uh and an organism

01:47:34.580 --> 01:47:40.340
is a model of its niche like a key is a model of the lock it opens so when we talk about these

01:47:40.340 --> 01:47:47.700
models it can be kind of extract kind of abstract but i think this model like a key is a model of

01:47:47.700 --> 01:47:54.820
the lock it opens really explains how an organism fits into a niche uh you could also say like a

01:47:54.820 --> 01:48:03.620
hand fits into a glove but it really uh the organism is a model of its environment so

01:48:03.620 --> 01:48:09.380
natural selection is essentially an information channel that through evolution is pumping in

01:48:09.380 --> 01:48:15.060
information from the external world from the environment into the organism such that the

01:48:15.060 --> 01:48:22.980
organism is encoding the structure of reality encoding the structure of the world and its design

01:48:24.180 --> 01:48:31.780
include uh encodes information about the outside world so it's kind of a new way to think about

01:48:31.780 --> 01:48:39.860
evolution is this process of basically the universe is modeling itself and waking up through this

01:48:39.940 --> 01:48:47.860
process it's pretty interesting um kind of psychedelic so um the law recommends it variety

01:48:48.420 --> 01:48:55.140
is just telling you about the sophistication of that model so how complex does the model have to be

01:48:55.140 --> 01:49:00.900
for the organism to stay far from equilibrium um ross ashby's law says

01:49:01.860 --> 01:49:10.260
so john noughton researcher at Cambridge uh kind of summed it up this way in colloquial terms

01:49:10.260 --> 01:49:15.300
ashby's law has come to be understood as a simple proposition if the system is to be able to deal

01:49:15.300 --> 01:49:19.460
successfully with the diversity of challenges that its environment produces then it needs to

01:49:19.460 --> 01:49:24.500
have a repertoire of responses which is at least as nuanced as the problems thrown up by the

01:49:24.500 --> 01:49:30.100
environment so a viable system is one that can handle the variability of its environment or as

01:49:30.100 --> 01:49:38.260
ashby put it only variety can absorb variety so it's what we said before with evolutionary

01:49:38.260 --> 01:49:46.500
epistemology an organism evolves to become as complex as its environmental niche requires

01:49:47.060 --> 01:49:55.860
it has to specifically have enough behavioral responses which map on to internal states so

01:49:55.860 --> 01:50:05.380
it has to have enough cognitive states to respond to the number of challenges that the environment

01:50:05.380 --> 01:50:14.740
presents challenges um in its ability to extract energy and when when you get organisms and you get

01:50:14.740 --> 01:50:23.380
other uh you get other agents other organisms then of course what the organism has to model

01:50:23.380 --> 01:50:28.900
is much more complicated because it doesn't have to just model the energy source in its environment

01:50:28.900 --> 01:50:39.220
like to get food it also has to model other modelers other cognitive agents um so yeah basically

01:50:41.380 --> 01:50:52.820
any adaptive system has uh a behavioral repertoire and a repertoire of accessible mental states or

01:50:52.820 --> 01:50:58.340
for things without brains computational states and the number of states that the organism can access

01:50:59.140 --> 01:51:07.540
uh should match the number of challenges the number of states that could surprise the organism

01:51:07.540 --> 01:51:13.700
by the environment um so a cat must have at least as many states as the ways the mouse can evade it

01:51:13.700 --> 01:51:18.420
and the mouse has to have enough behavioral states to get away so they model each other

01:51:19.380 --> 01:51:26.580
a swordsman like a fincer must have many blocks as his opponent has attacks and as we said

01:51:27.300 --> 01:51:33.300
because behavioral responses map on to unique internal states the loss of an organism must have

01:51:33.300 --> 01:51:39.140
as many accessible states as required by the complexity of the niche so we already said this

01:51:39.860 --> 01:51:44.100
organism is some simplest solution to the thermodynamic problem of staying far from equilibrium

01:51:44.180 --> 01:51:51.220
so a well-adapted species represents a biological solution to an existential thermodynamic

01:51:51.220 --> 01:51:56.660
dilemma it's a sort of living evolving scientific theory about how to most efficiently extract the

01:51:56.660 --> 01:52:02.500
free energy the lifeblood of existence out of a particular niche some niches present a changing

01:52:02.500 --> 01:52:06.740
variety of challenges that must be adapted to you while others present hardly any at all

01:52:06.740 --> 01:52:14.180
so almost done here I know it's a lot um hopefully this can kind of wrap up the ideas

01:52:14.180 --> 01:52:20.100
and kind of show how they're all connected um but this is still on this question of how complex

01:52:20.820 --> 01:52:29.780
is the universe uh how complex can it get so Olivia Judson wrote this uh

01:52:31.060 --> 01:52:35.700
published this paper called the energy expansions of evolution it's really nice people should check it

01:52:35.700 --> 01:52:41.700
out uh so she says the history of the earth life earth system can be divided into five energetic

01:52:41.700 --> 01:52:46.500
epochs each featuring the evolution of life forms that can exploit a new source of energy these

01:52:46.500 --> 01:52:51.940
sources are geochemical energy sunlight oxygen flesh and fire the first two are present at the

01:52:51.940 --> 01:52:57.220
start but oxygen flesh and fire all consequences of evolutionary events and then she makes this

01:52:57.220 --> 01:53:05.540
statement by the way red is quotes if people haven't uh figured that out so these are her words

01:53:05.540 --> 01:53:13.220
I forgot to put quote marks um so no category of energy sources disappeared this has over time

01:53:13.220 --> 01:53:17.620
resulted in an expanding realm of the sources of energy available to living organisms and a

01:53:17.620 --> 01:53:27.460
con commitment uh increase in the diversity and complexity of ecosystems so here's the way to

01:53:27.460 --> 01:53:34.580
think about it um so taking the thermodynamic perspective and looking at organisms as energy

01:53:34.580 --> 01:53:39.700
flow channels uh we can think of each niche on earth as a sort of energy slot for a given

01:53:39.700 --> 01:53:44.420
species and an evolving population of organisms efficiently searching the solution space will

01:53:44.420 --> 01:53:49.380
eventually just by chance discover a solution to a thermodynamic problem that it didn't know

01:53:49.380 --> 01:53:54.340
existed the discovery of a novel energy source or energy extraction technique is both how a new

01:53:54.340 --> 01:53:59.540
niche and a new species come into existence so phylogenetic learning which we saw in that

01:54:00.260 --> 01:54:06.740
chart will naturally lead to speciation because organisms will stumble upon new ways to exploit

01:54:06.740 --> 01:54:12.580
thermodynamic niches that were previously inaccessible to life purely for design reasons

01:54:12.580 --> 01:54:19.060
we're going to give examples on the next slide um so as the biosphere accumulates knowledge

01:54:19.060 --> 01:54:23.940
through phylogenetic learning not only is the solution space corresponding to one kind of

01:54:23.940 --> 01:54:29.620
thermodynamic problem being explored there's a growing problem space each with its own unique

01:54:29.620 --> 01:54:38.740
solution space um so in an evolution so there's an evolutionary trajectory that's not determined

01:54:38.740 --> 01:54:44.500
in the strict sense uh envisioned by Laplace where like there's no freedom in the future is

01:54:44.500 --> 01:54:51.860
like set in stone but there is a sort of statistical determinism what i've been calling a non-equilibrium

01:54:51.860 --> 01:54:58.580
statistical determinism that guarantees that basically the inevitability of this emergence

01:54:58.580 --> 01:55:05.940
of a distribution of far from equilibrium attractors a varying varying degrees of complexity so each

01:55:05.940 --> 01:55:14.260
species can be seen as a an attractor that's exploiting this niche and you get this uh basically

01:55:14.260 --> 01:55:23.780
this diversity where you have uh organisms uh exploiting like the the energy niches that were

01:55:23.780 --> 01:55:29.220
kind of the easy ones to exploit on earth like the geochemical free energy we mentioned with

01:55:29.220 --> 01:55:35.300
the origin of life and then sunlight was a little bit of a more difficult challenge to

01:55:35.300 --> 01:55:43.860
extract sunlight it took some time for evolution to be able to do that um so uh extracting energy

01:55:43.860 --> 01:55:49.940
from the hydrothermal vents uh source of energy is really simple because the energy is already

01:55:49.940 --> 01:55:55.060
like flowing through the system it doesn't have to do much work to extract sunlight you have you

01:55:55.060 --> 01:56:02.500
know a moving sun it's a little bit more complicated but not nearly as complicated as organisms that

01:56:02.500 --> 01:56:10.100
eat other organisms so heterotrophic organisms um because they will have to model not just like a

01:56:10.100 --> 01:56:15.300
sun moving predictably through the air but have to model all these other agents many of which are

01:56:15.300 --> 01:56:24.820
trying to eat them to kill you um so basically so answering this question why increasingly

01:56:24.820 --> 01:56:30.740
intelligent species emerge we started off with reductive autotrophs those organisms around

01:56:30.740 --> 01:56:35.300
hydrothermal vents they were a solution to the problem of how to extract free energy from geochemical

01:56:35.300 --> 01:56:42.340
gradients um photosynthetic bacteria the ancestors of plants were the solution to extract of how to

01:56:42.340 --> 01:56:46.740
extract all the solar energy that was flowing through the planetary system so that was a big

01:56:47.380 --> 01:56:53.540
discovery made by life is that you can get energy directly from sunlight heterotrophic

01:56:53.540 --> 01:56:58.020
organisms organisms that eat other organisms were the solution to the problem of how to

01:56:58.020 --> 01:57:03.780
extract energy from life itself once life starts having to model life other agents with causal

01:57:03.780 --> 01:57:08.820
power and adaptive behavior the computational task of extracting free energy gets increasingly

01:57:08.820 --> 01:57:14.660
difficult as increasingly complex species arise so by virtue of having to model each other the

01:57:14.660 --> 01:57:21.860
complexity of some species gets ratcheted up by what's known as an evolutionary arms race so the

01:57:21.860 --> 01:57:28.580
lion is evolving you know well lions are producing offspring some of those lions will be better at

01:57:28.580 --> 01:57:35.140
predicting the gazelle's movements the gazelle will also be creating offspring and some of those

01:57:35.140 --> 01:57:41.860
will be better at predicting the lion's attack the ones that are better predicting are the ones that

01:57:41.860 --> 01:57:47.700
get to uh stick around so you see how you have this ratcheting mechanism that ratchets that

01:57:47.700 --> 01:57:56.020
ratchets its complexity there's actually a principle called the red queen principle

01:57:57.220 --> 01:58:05.140
that says that for an organism to simply stay in the game of existence certain organisms

01:58:05.140 --> 01:58:10.500
a certain species they will have to become increasingly complex and that comes from

01:58:11.460 --> 01:58:19.380
uh alice in wonderland basically uh there's a scene with the red queen and alices they're

01:58:19.380 --> 01:58:24.580
they're all running as fast as they can and alice is like you know i'm running fast as i i keep

01:58:24.580 --> 01:58:29.220
running but i'm i'm going nowhere like so they're they're all running but they're they're not making

01:58:29.220 --> 01:58:34.340
any distance they're staying in place and the queen says something like oh you see here for that

01:58:35.060 --> 01:58:45.460
uh to go somewhere you'll have to run much faster than that um so the idea is that for a species

01:58:46.660 --> 01:58:51.700
that has to deal with this complex environment just to stay where it is just to stay in the

01:58:51.700 --> 01:58:59.860
game of existence it has to become increasingly complex it has to keep adapting so one thing

01:58:59.860 --> 01:59:05.700
that i wanted to get into more but i'm not going to is this idea of empowerment it comes from the

01:59:05.700 --> 01:59:11.060
computational neuroscience literature it's similar it comes from daniel pilani but it's very similar

01:59:11.060 --> 01:59:18.980
to harvard's uh alex wissner vizner gross he has an idea called causal entropic forcing but

01:59:18.980 --> 01:59:27.940
basically these people are arguing that um well vizner gross is arguing that a causal entropic force

01:59:29.940 --> 01:59:37.140
means that like basically with like evolution you'll get a system systems that uh are trying to

01:59:37.140 --> 01:59:47.140
maximize the number of states they can respond to so the maximize and the number of states they

01:59:47.140 --> 01:59:52.980
can respond to is mirrored by their internal diversity so systems naturally try to increase

01:59:52.980 --> 02:00:01.460
the number of states and it's this ability that allows for intelligence because if you have more

02:00:01.460 --> 02:00:08.980
states going back to this law of requisite variety you can respond to more challenges so not every

02:00:08.980 --> 02:00:16.260
species is increasing empowerment but you will get the emergence of increasing uh increasingly

02:00:16.260 --> 02:00:26.180
complex uh species because uh each species uh serves as food for a potential new species um

02:00:27.140 --> 02:00:34.100
you will get increasingly complex species that emerge over time and they will be increasingly

02:00:34.100 --> 02:00:41.380
empowered meaning that they can respond to more environmental states and that they have more

02:00:41.380 --> 02:00:48.660
accessible mental or cognitive states um i explained some of this in the last

02:00:49.380 --> 02:00:54.420
slide but i'll just explain a little more so open-ended niche emergence why is the evolutionary

02:00:54.420 --> 02:01:01.060
record shown a trend of the emergence of increasingly complex forms um because when all conceivable

02:01:01.060 --> 02:01:05.540
niches on earth were filled that wasn't the end new species created new niches because the free

02:01:05.540 --> 02:01:12.500
energy slot they provide is themselves their food so cybernetics guy he's kind of like the last

02:01:13.060 --> 02:01:19.620
living cybernet assist kind of um i'm sure there are other people that call themselves that but

02:01:19.620 --> 02:01:26.100
he's kind of kept that title even when it like wasn't trendy um he says is well documented by

02:01:26.100 --> 02:01:30.660
evolutionary biologists that ecosystems tend to become more complex the number of different

02:01:30.660 --> 02:01:35.140
species increases and the number of dependencies and other linkages linkages between species

02:01:35.140 --> 02:01:43.300
increases he cites eo wilson who recently passed away um who did a lot of work that that kind of

02:01:43.300 --> 02:01:51.060
inspired a lot of the concepts in the book um not just this niche emergence but also talking about

02:01:51.060 --> 02:01:57.060
super organisms so collectives like ant colonies and self-organizing systems at all scales but he

02:01:57.060 --> 02:02:01.860
said not only do ecosystems contain typically lots of niches that will eventually be filled

02:02:01.860 --> 02:02:08.020
by new species but there is a self-reinforcing tendency to create new niches what does that mean

02:02:08.660 --> 02:02:15.060
it means uh the biosphere uh certainly ecosystems are themselves autocatalytic sets

02:02:16.500 --> 02:02:22.660
so sethloid he's talking about these chemical autocatalytic sets but it's i should have had

02:02:22.660 --> 02:02:28.740
this on the earlier slide but it'll be a good way to kind of show the equivalence between ecosystems

02:02:28.980 --> 02:02:32.980
sethloids as autocatalytic sets of reactions are powerful systems in addition to computing they

02:02:32.980 --> 02:02:37.620
can produce a wide variety of chemical outputs in effect an autocatalytic set of reactions is

02:02:37.620 --> 02:02:42.340
like a tiny computer controlled factory for producing chemicals some of these chemicals

02:02:42.340 --> 02:02:49.460
are the constituents of life now steward coughman big you know one of the main names who's kind of

02:02:49.460 --> 02:02:56.100
this whole talk he's kind of put these ideas out there uh since like the early 90s well actually

02:02:56.420 --> 02:03:01.700
going back farther than that but he started writing books in the 90s and really gaining

02:03:01.700 --> 02:03:08.260
exposure for the Santa Fe Institute uh he's written a recent paper well semi-recent um

02:03:08.820 --> 02:03:15.140
about uh niche emergence as an autocatalytic process so ecosystems are autocatalytic

02:03:15.140 --> 02:03:22.260
autocatalytically closed self-sustaining reaction networks so they're autopoietic agents that reliably

02:03:22.900 --> 02:03:28.500
drive up biological diversity and complexity as they self-amplify and evolve so when you think

02:03:28.500 --> 02:03:33.220
about it really all integrated networks of adaptive systems function as autocatalytic sets

02:03:33.220 --> 02:03:39.060
there's been a lot of papers showing this economies in a sense are autocatalytic sets including the

02:03:39.060 --> 02:03:47.860
social organisms we call societies or civilizations um so these networks are common because they

02:03:47.860 --> 02:03:52.820
emerge spontaneously when many organisms repeatedly interact with one another and discover

02:03:52.820 --> 02:03:59.380
synergistic collective configurations as nature often pressures them to do so we're at the end

02:04:00.420 --> 02:04:07.940
almost uh we've explained why complexity increases uh evolution will not increase the complexity

02:04:07.940 --> 02:04:14.100
of every species they will become adapted to their niche they will match the complexity of the niche

02:04:14.100 --> 02:04:21.140
however because new niches are always emerging because species act as food for a potential new

02:04:21.140 --> 02:04:28.980
species um because of that process you will get this increase uh you will get species that emerge

02:04:28.980 --> 02:04:35.700
that have a higher number of a larger repertoire of mental and behavioral states so the law of

02:04:35.700 --> 02:04:42.660
requisite variety really explains why more complex environments create more complex niches and this

02:04:42.660 --> 02:04:52.420
is open-ended there's really no uh limit to how far this process can go especially since humans

02:04:53.060 --> 02:04:58.900
who are the pinnacle of this process we're not you know a lot of people have been against these

02:04:58.900 --> 02:05:03.780
kinds of views because it seems like it's saying that humans are superior we're superior maybe

02:05:03.780 --> 02:05:09.540
computationally but not superior in any other sense we're actually part of the biosphere

02:05:09.540 --> 02:05:15.700
which is this integrated interconnected system so it's really you know it doesn't make sense to

02:05:15.700 --> 02:05:21.060
think of us as like superior to nature because the whole biosphere is an organism that we're just

02:05:21.060 --> 02:05:27.140
sort of an organ for uh we're basically the nervous system of the planet the cybernetic

02:05:28.020 --> 02:05:32.260
global system that people have called Gaia some people don't like that name I think it's a perfectly

02:05:32.260 --> 02:05:43.700
good name but um that's why uh complexity gets ratcheted up but the final um uh I guess uh part

02:05:43.700 --> 02:05:50.820
of of this complexity increased story is that not only do you get increasingly complex species uh

02:05:50.820 --> 02:05:59.860
those species will interact naturally to form higher level uh adaptive systems which are

02:05:59.940 --> 02:06:07.540
collectives so um I call this the principle of recursive self-organization based on Ashby's

02:06:07.540 --> 02:06:13.620
principle of self-organization what I'm arguing is that when you have a biosphere with these

02:06:13.620 --> 02:06:18.420
agents and you have some are simple and some are complex naturally those agents will interact

02:06:19.060 --> 02:06:26.580
when they interact they will uh in many cases discover synergistic collective configurations

02:06:26.580 --> 02:06:32.260
so configurations that make it easier for each agent to extract the energy they need to stay

02:06:32.260 --> 02:06:39.060
far from equilibrium so why do interacting agents link up to form stable holes for the

02:06:39.060 --> 02:06:42.820
exact same reason that molecules with the right chemical diversity will form stable

02:06:42.820 --> 02:06:47.940
autocatalytic reaction sets when pushed by a flow of energy working collectively allows the whole

02:06:47.940 --> 02:06:54.340
system to extract more free energy with less work we can that's the whole point of synergy

02:06:54.340 --> 02:06:59.940
is that working together makes your workload easier because there's a distribution of labor

02:07:01.380 --> 02:07:08.180
and it's it's really nice um that you know this uh distribution of species with some

02:07:08.180 --> 02:07:14.580
simple and some complex uh that's really what you need to create this like uh cybernetic

02:07:14.580 --> 02:07:22.260
adaptive system at the level of a planet because a system uh needs diversity among its components

02:07:22.260 --> 02:07:27.460
in structure and function for there to be this distribution of labor labor which makes it this

02:07:28.900 --> 02:07:39.700
collective whole this this synergistic holistic unit um so it's actually good that evolution

02:07:39.700 --> 02:07:46.580
in adaptation isn't increasing this the complexity of each species like each species isn't becoming

02:07:46.580 --> 02:07:51.380
intelligent like roaches aren't becoming like more and more intelligent over time with no limit

02:07:52.420 --> 02:07:58.900
the biosphere wouldn't be stable if that were the case uh it's really uh ecosystems need this

02:07:58.900 --> 02:08:05.540
diversity among components just as a car with made of all engines isn't going to be functional

02:08:05.540 --> 02:08:12.420
or our organism made of all brains you need a variety of parts some simple some complex because

02:08:12.420 --> 02:08:17.860
they all do different functions um so nature promotes cooperation collaboration and synergy

02:08:17.860 --> 02:08:24.500
because it is thermodynamically beneficial for all parties um synergistic collective configurations

02:08:24.500 --> 02:08:29.540
will eventually be discovered by many component systems that are exploring various states or

02:08:29.540 --> 02:08:35.540
configurations through the blind variation and selective retention mechanism mentioned organisms

02:08:35.540 --> 02:08:40.740
only compete until they finally figure out what that working together makes everyone's task easier

02:08:41.380 --> 02:08:47.060
and that goes for humans too so it's kind of a moral lesson for everybody the nations have to

02:08:47.060 --> 02:08:54.420
work together we shouldn't um get rid of the nations there shouldn't just be this evolution

02:08:54.420 --> 02:09:01.460
into this like global government because the nations are actually uh provide this diversity

02:09:01.460 --> 02:09:08.020
that we're saying is important uh because you need this uh diversity of component parts to create

02:09:08.020 --> 02:09:13.460
a division of labor so there's strength in diversity this is different than the evolutionary

02:09:13.460 --> 02:09:18.180
picture of survival of the fittest whereas there's just like this idea that the stronger the most

02:09:18.180 --> 02:09:23.060
intelligent survive this is saying that that's not true it's the most adaptive that survive has

02:09:23.060 --> 02:09:28.500
nothing to do with strength or intelligence sloths have been around for many millions of years despite

02:09:29.140 --> 02:09:36.180
being sloths being slow uh because they exploit uh source of free energy that's not being exploited

02:09:36.260 --> 02:09:45.860
by another uh species so um going back to this kind of global message you want nations to retain

02:09:45.860 --> 02:09:55.140
their identities but you also want them at the same time to come together and to work synergistically

02:09:55.140 --> 02:10:03.300
so you basically want something like a global system but this there has to be the optimal

02:10:03.300 --> 02:10:11.300
balance between centralization and decentralization um neither approach will be good on its own

02:10:11.300 --> 02:10:19.460
there needs to be this balance so um as long as the biosphere is creating a growing variety of

02:10:19.460 --> 02:10:23.220
complex adaptive systems some of those will interact to produce higher level complex adaptive

02:10:23.220 --> 02:10:29.540
systems which will come together to form even larger ones this process continues uh at higher

02:10:29.540 --> 02:10:37.140
scales so i didn't go into this left out a kind of a neat picture that shows a brain and then the

02:10:37.140 --> 02:10:44.500
planet and it's like information networks but uh i do i i hope that you know talk about gaya and

02:10:44.500 --> 02:10:50.420
global brain will become uh will be taken as seriously as it should be uh they really only

02:10:50.420 --> 02:10:55.540
weren't taken seriously because there were mystical notions associated with this word gaya

02:10:55.540 --> 02:11:01.940
which wasn't even james uh love locks uh fault he act the name gaya came from his neighbor

02:11:02.660 --> 02:11:09.940
who is actually the author of lord of the flies boim golden so blame him for the for the flowery

02:11:10.580 --> 02:11:17.940
metaphor with gaya um but yeah the the biosphere is a cybernetic organism and we are forming

02:11:17.940 --> 02:11:24.500
something like the global brain and a self replicating biosphere uh is essentially

02:11:25.140 --> 02:11:31.540
the next step and when we are trying to care for planets like mars that can be seen as the

02:11:31.540 --> 02:11:40.420
biosphere replicating uh for humans to at this point in our stage of development we would have

02:11:40.420 --> 02:11:46.180
to kind of convert mars to like a something like a biosphere to have like oxygen and so

02:11:46.180 --> 02:11:51.380
you can see how it's replication with variation you get the same sort of thing but because it's

02:11:51.380 --> 02:11:56.020
a different planet there's going to be a variation it's not going to be exactly the same but that's

02:11:56.020 --> 02:12:00.980
how the evolutionary process continues i should show this earlier this is just showing how like

02:12:01.700 --> 02:12:06.900
eukaryotic single celled organisms like amoebas will come together to form communities like a

02:12:06.900 --> 02:12:14.820
slime mold uh these multi cellular organisms come together to form colonies you see this

02:12:15.620 --> 02:12:20.900
ant colony ants actually really do form a superorganism you can see here they actually

02:12:20.900 --> 02:12:27.940
build a bridge out of their bodies so that some ants can like climb across that bridge so it really

02:12:27.940 --> 02:12:34.740
makes sense to call it a superorganism or at least like a super adaptive system or like a meta

02:12:35.700 --> 02:12:42.100
meta system um because without it we can't make sense of this collective behavior that's functional

02:12:42.980 --> 02:12:49.700
of course human civilization the again seed is hierarchy now it makes more sense we see that

02:12:49.700 --> 02:12:55.300
these evolutionary transitions oh yeah these are called evolutionary transitions sometimes i use the

02:12:55.300 --> 02:13:02.340
name meta system transition because um if we were talking about the brain i would also talk about

02:13:02.420 --> 02:13:09.540
like the emergence of a prefrontal cortex which is like a high level controller um that's also

02:13:09.540 --> 02:13:15.540
like a meta system transition so meta system transitions are a little extend this where it's

02:13:15.540 --> 02:13:21.860
not talking necessarily about evolutionary transitions but these other transitions where

02:13:22.500 --> 02:13:33.140
systems start to model themselves um so here we see uh how evolution has created these

02:13:33.780 --> 02:13:41.300
different memory systems these knowledge repositories so it's that process of recursive

02:13:41.300 --> 02:13:47.700
self-organization that creates new memory systems when you get go from single cell life to multi

02:13:47.780 --> 02:13:55.380
cellular life to life with brains uh it's uh these are revolutions in information storage

02:13:55.380 --> 02:14:01.140
machinery so you can see how the information in the biosphere gets accumulated through an

02:14:01.140 --> 02:14:11.380
evolutionary process um these are the final points yeah so knowledge is powers not just

02:14:11.380 --> 02:14:15.780
the hollow buzz phrase of the digital age it's true in the most fundamental way uncertainty

02:14:16.180 --> 02:14:21.060
information is life's first and last weapon in ongoing war with disorder without knowledge

02:14:21.060 --> 02:14:26.020
life cannot exist for more than a moment much less colonize the galaxy and beyond this suggests

02:14:26.020 --> 02:14:29.620
it's sitting out in the path toward cosmic superiority it's not a choice that intelligent

02:14:29.620 --> 02:14:34.580
agents like homo sapiens make upon careful reflection nor is it just some quirky ambition

02:14:34.580 --> 02:14:40.420
we somewhat answered by chance this is the main point humanities collective desire to transcend

02:14:40.420 --> 02:14:46.740
mortality and expand outward into space so apparent from our current scientific and technological

02:14:46.740 --> 02:14:52.980
endeavors space x uh this doesn't emerge as an accident this is inevitable consequence of the

02:14:52.980 --> 02:14:58.980
fact that continual knowledge acquisition is a fundamental biological imperative if life wants

02:14:58.980 --> 02:15:04.980
to persist and stay far from equilibrium at some point it has to get off the planet because the sun

02:15:05.700 --> 02:15:13.300
is uh going to die and uh it's these sorts of problems these existential problems which

02:15:13.300 --> 02:15:19.620
create progress because it's our awareness of this problem which uh forces us to

02:15:21.700 --> 02:15:27.540
search the configuration space for the solutions that solve the problem so it's natural selection

02:15:27.540 --> 02:15:31.380
points information from the inanimate world into life nature begins modeling itself encoding

02:15:31.380 --> 02:15:36.900
its own structure and the universe begins to wake up we are the cosmos come alive not metaphorically

02:15:36.900 --> 02:15:44.180
but literally this is Ray Kurzweil's uh image from his book this hilarity is near you can see that

02:15:44.740 --> 02:15:51.220
he sees this he calls this the the destiny of of life in the universe and he's not shy about

02:15:51.220 --> 02:15:57.540
using that word um again it's not determined in the strict sense of replace this uh kind of a

02:15:57.540 --> 02:16:04.100
statistical determinism that creates these uh series of attractors and um

02:16:05.860 --> 02:16:11.940
you've seen famous people uh so you know some people see that idea and they'll have been

02:16:11.940 --> 02:16:16.260
reading brian green and listening to all these reductionists and think that's not a scientific

02:16:16.260 --> 02:16:23.620
view well uh that's not true and um i hope to see more of these people speaking out about it so

02:16:23.620 --> 02:16:28.660
Christoph Koch in confessions of a romantic reductionist says the rise of sentient life

02:16:28.660 --> 02:16:34.180
within times wide circuit was inevitable teal hard day shard in we really came up with this don't

02:16:34.180 --> 02:16:38.660
have time to talk about him french philosopher in jezzouette you should look into is correct in his

02:16:38.660 --> 02:16:43.220
view that the islands within the universe if not the whole cosmos are evolving toward ever

02:16:43.220 --> 02:16:49.380
greater complexity and self-knowledge to be clear he's not saying that earth had to bear life that

02:16:49.380 --> 02:16:55.620
you know primates had to walk to the african godslands but he says i do believe that the

02:16:55.620 --> 02:17:00.100
laws of physics overwhelmingly favored the emergence of consciousness the universe is a

02:17:00.100 --> 02:17:06.900
work in progress such a belief evokes jeri Jeremy at an island for many biologists and

02:17:06.900 --> 02:17:13.780
philosophers but the evidence from cosmology biology and history is compelling so there's

02:17:13.780 --> 02:17:21.140
some uh advanced blurbs for this book uh if you want to pre-order it um it comes out in june

02:17:22.020 --> 02:17:27.460
but every order that i get from now until then will count towards my first week sales total

02:17:27.460 --> 02:17:32.740
so that will help me get on best sellers list if you want to pre-order it now and you email me um

02:17:32.740 --> 02:17:39.140
i will send you a copy soon of this novel i also wrote called road to omega i was pretty busy in the

02:17:39.140 --> 02:17:46.740
last five years yeah i went into a cave for like four or five years but this uh is a vehicle for

02:17:46.740 --> 02:17:52.500
the science and philosophy in the book kind of like an anti-iron rand at the shrug maybe the

02:17:52.500 --> 02:17:58.500
opposite philosophy um and the road to omega sub-stack kind of turns this philosophy into

02:17:58.500 --> 02:18:06.180
kind of an effort to um save the world with uh science epistemology and blockchain technology

02:18:06.900 --> 02:18:12.020
uh blockchains are part of this self-organization process and that's the longest talk i've ever

02:18:12.020 --> 02:18:17.060
given that's the longest i've ever talked at one time probably my wife will probably say

02:18:17.060 --> 02:18:23.700
that's not true but i'm tired so let's uh open it up to questions and thank you for your immense

02:18:23.700 --> 02:18:32.260
patience it's awesome to hear and think about it so there are two questions in the chat first is

02:18:32.340 --> 02:18:41.540
from dean dean asks how would we explain caring through a lens of free will or no free will would

02:18:41.540 --> 02:18:46.420
free will deniers say there's no caring when it appears that agents can or do fully care

02:18:48.340 --> 02:18:55.860
yeah so great question um unfortunately i don't have much to say without saying the things that

02:18:55.860 --> 02:19:01.380
i was going to bring up in the next talk really explaining what free will is i guess i should

02:19:01.380 --> 02:19:07.540
just say right now uh kind of a brief explanation of what i mean by free will so i hope i've made

02:19:07.540 --> 02:19:16.180
the argument that agency emerges uh in adaptive systems that start off as biological organisms

02:19:16.900 --> 02:19:22.740
and um to the person that's self-driving car thing i uh just to mention that real quick

02:19:22.740 --> 02:19:29.300
i don't think they're agents but i do think uh it's possible to create systems with agency

02:19:30.260 --> 02:19:38.740
for reasons that i haven't gone into um it seems important that the systems have a certain type

02:19:38.740 --> 02:19:45.140
of architecture so not like a standard computer as a von Neumann architecture and it's not

02:19:45.700 --> 02:19:51.860
distributed and integrated in the way the brain is so it's not integrating much information so

02:19:51.940 --> 02:20:00.340
these systems won't have causal power they won't be agents um so uh neuromorphic hardware has been

02:20:01.460 --> 02:20:07.380
a lot of people think that's going to allow machines that can think and perhaps even be conscious

02:20:07.380 --> 02:20:12.500
um i think maybe that's the way to go uh it's probably a lot more complicated than that that's

02:20:12.500 --> 02:20:19.300
a step in the right direction so agency is real it's uh due to information gaining causal power

02:20:19.300 --> 02:20:28.580
in a system and starts uh it starts steering the system so you'll see like a bacterium performing

02:20:28.580 --> 02:20:34.740
chemotaxis but does it make sense to say that the bacterium has free will when it's going this way

02:20:34.740 --> 02:20:39.780
and that just because it's not predictable in the way an inanimate system is so i would say that

02:20:39.780 --> 02:20:46.260
they have agency but they don't have free will what uh free will is and it's not my idea other

02:20:46.260 --> 02:20:51.540
people have kind of been talking in this way kevin michael uh has a book neurogeneticist uh

02:20:52.180 --> 02:20:57.940
he's coming out with a book called agents which is all about agency and free will but um the idea is

02:20:57.940 --> 02:21:10.340
that we are agents with causal power but um we're sort of uh where um our responses like

02:21:10.340 --> 02:21:19.620
are basically uh programmed responses uh that are responses that occur um automatically uh that

02:21:19.620 --> 02:21:24.820
are informed by this uh information that's been built up through evolution and adaptive learning

02:21:25.380 --> 02:21:30.100
so a lot of the time we go through the day and we're not really thinking about things like

02:21:30.100 --> 02:21:35.940
driving or like waking up and like you know going to the fridge we're not putting conscious thought

02:21:35.940 --> 02:21:42.740
into that so that wouldn't seem to be free will uh to me you're you're kind of acting on autopilot

02:21:42.740 --> 02:21:48.660
so what free will is is uh a higher level of control that emerges with something like a

02:21:48.660 --> 02:21:56.500
prefrontal cortex in a global workspace basically free will allow uh a prefrontal cortex allows an

02:21:56.500 --> 02:22:06.580
agent to override its uh instinctive and automatic behaviors um and so free will is something that uh

02:22:07.380 --> 02:22:13.380
that we have but only if we're exercising this higher level of control it's associated with

02:22:13.380 --> 02:22:21.860
cognitive control or executive control effortful control and basically um if you have a healthy

02:22:21.940 --> 02:22:29.140
functioning prefrontal cortex uh you're going to basically the conscious mind is monitoring

02:22:30.340 --> 02:22:37.620
consciousness is a monitor uh so it's it's monitoring uh your behaviors and if it uh

02:22:38.260 --> 02:22:42.660
detects that there's suboptimal behavior for whatever reason like it's just automatic kind of

02:22:42.660 --> 02:22:49.060
instinctual let's say someone says something that makes us angry and we respond immediately

02:22:49.060 --> 02:22:55.700
with like pushing them or something uh that's not a wise move and that maybe may happen when we're

02:22:55.700 --> 02:23:04.020
fearful because of the amygdala response and we just have this automatic behavior um but uh free

02:23:04.020 --> 02:23:12.340
will would be when uh the conscious mind overrides that process and uh labette actually the free will

02:23:12.340 --> 02:23:19.060
studies that everybody cites as saying that we don't have free will he actually never said that

02:23:19.060 --> 02:23:24.900
he said free will is in this veto power like maybe some of our voluntary movements occur without

02:23:24.900 --> 02:23:32.500
conscious thought but it's our ability to override those movements uh that is the source of free will

02:23:33.780 --> 02:23:37.460
but there was more problems with that actually um the studies have

02:23:38.420 --> 02:23:42.500
coped it a study showing that uh basically um

02:23:44.740 --> 02:23:52.100
that free will um uh readiness potential which is like a spike in electrical activity that occurs

02:23:52.100 --> 02:23:57.380
before you do this voluntary movement this movement we think is voluntary and everyone thought that

02:23:57.380 --> 02:24:01.620
this meant that you're not really making a conscious decision that you could see this

02:24:01.620 --> 02:24:07.220
spike in brain activity earlier than the person thought they made the voluntary voluntary decision

02:24:08.260 --> 02:24:12.980
but a new study has shown that that's only the case when we're making like arbitrary decisions

02:24:12.980 --> 02:24:17.780
and when they had people making a decision about when what went to donate like a large

02:24:17.780 --> 02:24:23.860
amount of money to a charity you actually saw this readiness potential disappear and so it seems

02:24:23.860 --> 02:24:30.100
like deliberate thinking which is still this like prefrontal cortex and there's this distinction

02:24:30.100 --> 02:24:35.460
between access access consciousness and phenomenal consciousness that i didn't go into that i would

02:24:35.460 --> 02:24:41.780
in the next talk that adam saffron and integrated world modern theory really gets at but the idea

02:24:41.780 --> 02:24:48.580
is that the prefrontal cortex does allow us to override automatic behaviors and that is a sort

02:24:48.580 --> 02:24:56.740
of freedom that we have and we also lose it uh in case of schizophrenia you see impaired uh

02:24:56.740 --> 02:25:02.260
prefrontal cortex activity and drug addicts you see impaired activity um in drug drug addicts

02:25:02.260 --> 02:25:09.140
you see they do repetitive behavior even when they know that it's uh not beneficial to them

02:25:09.140 --> 02:25:14.180
they will still engage in that so they're kind of stuck in this loop for this unhealthy attractor

02:25:15.220 --> 02:25:21.540
with schizophrenia there's patients that report being pushed around by forces that are beyond

02:25:21.540 --> 02:25:29.460
their control uh i think that's because when the prefrontal cortex is uh basically deactivated um

02:25:30.420 --> 02:25:36.980
people lose this sense this ability to override their automatic behaviors and i think that's what

02:25:36.980 --> 02:25:42.180
those people are experiencing is sort of loss of this higher level agency that we've called free will

02:25:44.180 --> 02:25:50.420
another interesting just the final interesting thing to mention about that is a cotard's syndrome

02:25:50.420 --> 02:25:55.300
a cotard's delusion is this delusion where people think they're dead they think they're

02:25:56.100 --> 02:26:00.340
like ghost or just not alive it's really weird a lot of people die from starvation

02:26:00.340 --> 02:26:02.980
because they think they don't have to eat because they think they're already dead

02:26:04.020 --> 02:26:10.100
you actually see from neuroimaging studies they've showed uh like impaired activity in the

02:26:10.100 --> 02:26:17.620
prefrontal cortex so maybe these people who think they're dead have lost this high level agency and

02:26:17.620 --> 02:26:27.060
they feel like they're ghosts or something um as far as caring uh so um caring is a part of like

02:26:27.780 --> 02:26:33.460
emerged through evolution because you do have this benefit to cooperating with each other

02:26:33.460 --> 02:26:37.220
this self-organization process that we talked about that happens naturally because

02:26:37.860 --> 02:26:42.740
basically you find that when you work together you minimize conflicts and um

02:26:42.900 --> 02:26:53.220
uh align it you align interest and so caring altruism empathy all of those things are as natural

02:26:54.100 --> 02:27:02.180
uh and as Darwinian as anything else but you have to add on to evolutionary theory all of this

02:27:02.180 --> 02:27:08.500
stuff about self-organization and cooperative evolution um as far as he said he said something

02:27:08.500 --> 02:27:16.900
about why people uh who uh don't believe in free will I forget the exact point about the caring

02:27:16.900 --> 02:27:23.060
what was that um when when it appears that agents can or do fully care

02:27:25.140 --> 02:27:31.300
but sorry what was uh what was the first part of it um how would you explain caring through lens of

02:27:31.300 --> 02:27:36.180
free will or no free will would free will deniers say there is no caring when it appears that

02:27:36.180 --> 02:27:44.500
agents can or do fully care yeah no it's it it flies in the face of like uh our our everyday

02:27:44.500 --> 02:27:53.540
experience so like yeah um I the the the amount of contradictions and like logic that doesn't

02:27:53.540 --> 02:28:00.340
make sense when you go down that path of there being no free will or agency um you just you just

02:28:00.420 --> 02:28:07.060
get into absurd territory it's I think when we look back it's going to look quaint that for so

02:28:07.060 --> 02:28:12.340
long that we thought that everything was determined in a strict sense and it's really a big issue

02:28:12.340 --> 02:28:15.780
because these people who believe that if they believe it if they take it to heart

02:28:17.540 --> 02:28:22.020
they're experiencing cognitive dissonance at every moment you know and the people who

02:28:22.660 --> 02:28:28.660
argue against agency they talk about religious people having to compartmentalize to deal with

02:28:28.660 --> 02:28:33.940
you know the the real world but anybody who believes that we don't have agency has to compartmentalize

02:28:33.940 --> 02:28:42.900
in the same way uh funny little conversation between Sam Harris and his wife um uh Annika Harris

02:28:42.900 --> 02:28:49.300
who wrote a book called conscious that is a great accessible book but it leaves out like everything

02:28:49.300 --> 02:28:55.540
that I've discussed and that I would discuss about like the Bayesian brain hypothesis uh global

02:28:55.540 --> 02:29:01.300
workspace theory doesn't really go into integrate information theory in any depth so like all of

02:29:01.300 --> 02:29:07.620
the things that they're missing that do explain a lot of this stuff uh can be found in like modern

02:29:07.620 --> 02:29:13.460
neuroscience so we are making a lot of progress towards you know understanding the hard problem

02:29:13.460 --> 02:29:18.740
of consciousness so subjective experience but also a free will and agency but it's funny because

02:29:18.740 --> 02:29:25.060
they're having this conversation in the podcast and they're discussing whether since a belief in

02:29:25.060 --> 02:29:31.940
no free will as mentioned that New York Times article I think 2011 showed that they have less

02:29:31.940 --> 02:29:36.900
moral behavior and it can you know cause depression they're discussing whether they should tell their

02:29:36.900 --> 02:29:41.300
daughter about free will or not that that she doesn't have any free will the discussion is like

02:29:41.300 --> 02:29:47.620
should we tell our daughter that she doesn't have free will but the actual discussion implies that

02:29:47.620 --> 02:29:51.460
they believe that they have some choice whether to tell her or not they're having a discussion

02:29:51.460 --> 02:29:56.340
about whether they should do this or not so there's a contradiction in their conversation

02:29:57.060 --> 02:30:01.620
that contradicts what they believe what's interesting is that if they do tell her that

02:30:01.620 --> 02:30:07.060
she has no free will and she believes it she's actually gonna have negative mental effects

02:30:07.060 --> 02:30:13.460
like it will ha you know be harmful um assuming that she really believes it I don't know if it has

02:30:13.460 --> 02:30:21.700
that in in everyone but you do see studies that show that um so if we do have free will it's a very

02:30:22.420 --> 02:30:30.020
bad thing to be telling people um and the last thing I'll say about that is well it's it's

02:30:30.020 --> 02:30:36.260
interesting because if she's familiar with epistemology and they tell her that she doesn't have free will

02:30:36.260 --> 02:30:41.780
but she goes okay that's based on a model that has uncertainty and that model may be disproved

02:30:42.580 --> 02:30:47.140
then she might not have the negative effects of free will so I think

02:30:47.140 --> 02:30:52.180
everyone should practice being a good Bayesian and understand that our models our theories even

02:30:52.180 --> 02:30:58.180
the one that I just talked about um will have errors and will be shown to be wrong and if

02:30:58.180 --> 02:31:04.660
reductionists do that they won't call free will belief and free will like comparing them to horoscopes

02:31:04.660 --> 02:31:10.100
which is just I think a horrible statement and kind of funny that physicists don't like it

02:31:10.100 --> 02:31:15.460
when like neuroscientists start and biologists start like talking about physics it's kind of

02:31:15.460 --> 02:31:20.740
strange that physicists are are so sure that we don't have free will when they're not familiar

02:31:20.740 --> 02:31:29.220
at all with the neuroscience behind agency and free will so would you like me to just

02:31:29.220 --> 02:31:35.540
read a comment in the chat otherwise I think we can kind of come to a close um if there's anything

02:31:35.540 --> 02:31:42.100
yeah I can do one more question yeah well uh Marco and Dave and others thanks a lot for the great

02:31:42.660 --> 02:31:48.260
comments and commentary in the chat I hope that Bobby I hope you check the live chat replay

02:31:49.700 --> 02:31:56.980
and uh Sean O'Connor wrote thanks for the good and informative talk Dr Azarian mentioned the idea

02:31:56.980 --> 02:32:01.780
of evolutionary arms race I was hoping to recommend that he consider if he hasn't

02:32:02.340 --> 02:32:09.300
how an introspect specific evolutionary arms race may relate I'm not familiar with the introspect

02:32:09.300 --> 02:32:18.820
specific so uh perhaps like a game theory red queen not between uh two species but within one

02:32:20.340 --> 02:32:27.940
species yes so you have an evolutionary arms race there too yeah certainly because you're

02:32:28.020 --> 02:32:35.700
competing with other organisms um and uh uh John Maynard Smith who I mentioned earlier

02:32:36.580 --> 02:32:43.780
talking about like this causal power of information biology he uh was the person to bring

02:32:43.780 --> 02:32:51.460
von Neumann's game theory to biological evolution so he did all he basically showed that there is

02:32:51.460 --> 02:32:58.020
this you know game theory sort of process being played out I think he his examples use different

02:32:58.020 --> 02:33:06.100
species but I think within species um you would see the sorts same sort of thing of course if it's

02:33:06.100 --> 02:33:12.740
not humans you know if you have other species people are competing organisms are competing

02:33:12.740 --> 02:33:17.460
you will get increased complexity but there are limits so just because there's these evolutionary

02:33:17.460 --> 02:33:25.220
arm races uh within and between species there will still be a limit because uh they have to model

02:33:25.220 --> 02:33:32.660
the environment and just modeling all these unnecessary variables uh is is wasteful so um

02:33:33.220 --> 02:33:40.980
it will ratchet up complexity in species but um I think at least with the planet earth and our

02:33:40.980 --> 02:33:52.020
biosphere that uh that humans are this sort of leading envelope uh of complexity and um so it

02:33:52.020 --> 02:33:58.180
really just is open-ended with the most complex species so the most complex species is the one

02:33:58.180 --> 02:34:05.300
that will evolve toward higher complexity and uh really there might be a limit there there are

02:34:05.300 --> 02:34:10.420
reasons to think there are limits to how far human biological intelligence can emerge there's

02:34:10.500 --> 02:34:15.060
I mean can evolve towards there's something called a sephalization limit which is like

02:34:15.060 --> 02:34:20.980
how big our brain can get because of reasons like having to do with like the skull and um

02:34:21.620 --> 02:34:29.140
so but what's interesting is part of this process this evolutionary process is as popper and

02:34:29.940 --> 02:34:34.660
newer people like Dennett have mentioned continues with science and culture and technology

02:34:35.220 --> 02:34:42.020
so humans really have open-ended complexity because we're uh we're augmenting ourselves

02:34:42.020 --> 02:34:48.820
with technology so while biology biological complexity may have limits there's no limits

02:34:49.540 --> 02:34:57.060
once we start merging with our technology and we shouldn't see technology as separate from life

02:34:57.780 --> 02:35:02.660
it's an extension of biology so the extended phenotype Richard Balkans explains like beaver

02:35:02.660 --> 02:35:08.500
dams considers like the dam that the beaver instinctually builds as part of the whole phenotype

02:35:08.500 --> 02:35:13.220
so the ecosystem the organism there's really no clear division between the organism and the

02:35:13.220 --> 02:35:18.500
ecosystem and David Chalmers has the extended mind hypothesis which says that our phones our

02:35:32.980 --> 02:35:40.500

02:35:40.500 --> 02:35:49.220
allow us to become hyper biological very interesting note perhaps to close it on
