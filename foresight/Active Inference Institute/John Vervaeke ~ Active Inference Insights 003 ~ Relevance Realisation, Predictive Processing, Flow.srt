00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,200
Okay, and we're away. Welcome, everybody, to the third episode of Active Inference Insights,

2
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,840
brought to you by the Active Inference Institute. I'm your host, Darius Parveezy-Wayne, and

3
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:24,920
today I am absolutely thrilled to be able to speak to John Viveke. John is an award-winning

4
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,600
professor of psychology, cognitive science, and Buddhist philosophy at the University

5
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,680
of Toronto. He is also the presenter of the renowned YouTube series Awakening from the

6
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:37,880
Meaning Crisis, as well as the newer After Socrates. His work focuses on 4e cognitive

7
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:42,520
science, which holds that cognition is embodied, embedded, enacted, and extended beyond the

8
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:48,000
brain. In particular, John explores relevance realisation, our adaptive ability to zero

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,720
in on salient information in a world of near-infinite complexity. Last year, he, Mark Miller, and

10
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:58,000
Brett Anderson wrote the paper Predictive Processing and Relevance Realisation, exploring

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,960
convergent solutions to the frame problem, which proposes that trade-offs in precision

12
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,840
weighting, a key second order dynamic in predictive processing hierarchies, are at the heart of

13
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,320
our ability to be intelligently ignorant. And that alignment of predictive processing

14
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,600
and relevance realisation is exactly what we're going to be talking about today. John,

15
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,060
welcome to the show. Thank you so much for joining us. It's an absolute treat.

16
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:28,180
Thank you, there is a great pleasure. I'm hoping that Mark does make it on in December.

17
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:33,180
That'll be great. Yeah, absolutely. But in his absence, because Mark was meant to be

18
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:39,060
here today, but it's unfortunate, he's not unfortunately able to make it. Perhaps, so

19
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:45,020
this podcast is acting as a kind of primer and introduction for our audience to the critical

20
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:50,380
themes in cognitive science and psychology and biology, as well as maths and physics,

21
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:58,260
as they are right now. So I think it would be a worthwhile place to start if you could

22
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:03,380
just unpick what relevance realisation is, and then we'll come to how it aligns with

23
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:13,900
predictive processing. Sure. So relevance realisation is sort of inverts the way common

24
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:20,260
sense works. Common sense is there's a lot that is obvious to us. And you know what it's

25
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:24,740
obvious what you should pay attention to. We're sometimes mistaken. But it's obvious

26
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:29,580
what we should be remembering and what we should be doing. And that's all obvious. And

27
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:35,980
we just run from that. Our job as cognitive scientists is to explain how the brain generates

28
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:43,500
that obviousness, that salience landscapes that makes the right things stand out as relevant

29
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:49,980
to us so that we can do what is astonishing, solve a wide variety of problems and a wide

30
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:56,060
variety of domains. You're a general problem solver, which is just astonishing. I mean,

31
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:00,460
you can learn Albanian history, you could learn about swimming or rock climbing, you

32
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:06,780
can take up the study of dinosaurs in the Jurassic period. Like it's just, you know,

33
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:12,020
it's just amazing and astonishing. And there's good empirical evidence you have something

34
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:16,020
like a general intelligence. There seems to be a general capacity. There's individual

35
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:21,140
variation in talent. Some people are better at learning this domain than other domains.

36
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:26,180
But they're way back from Spearman. We know there's some sort of general ability. I'm

37
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:30,900
going to propose that the general ability are two interlocking things, the anticipation

38
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:35,300
and relevance realisation. What I mean by a general ability is these are kind of meta

39
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,840
problems. These are the two big problems you have to solve when you're doing any other

40
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:45,560
specific problem solving. And what makes relevance realisation so hard, generating that obviousness

41
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:51,240
so mysterious, actually. And that's what Scott Atrin says. He says that what science does

42
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:56,280
is it makes what's common sense to take, takes to be obvious, mysterious. Here's a table

43
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,760
in front of me, but physics says, well, what is that really? And they're mysterious and

44
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,920
it's made out of quarks and all this sort of stuff. It's the same sort of thing here.

45
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:10,680
Because when you think about it outside of common sense, you realise that there's just

46
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,240
an overwhelming amount of information that's constantly, as you said, dynamically changing

47
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:19,320
in the environment. There's an overwhelming amount of information in your long-term memory

48
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:25,160
that's constantly changing and being readjusted to the reconstructive nature of memory. There

49
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:30,840
is an overwhelming number of combinations of actions you can perform, sequences of action.

50
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:37,080
And yet, you ignore that overwhelming, almost all of that overwhelming information

51
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:42,760
and zero in on the relevant information so that you are oriented right in the world,

52
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:49,000
finding things obvious, salient, standing out. And it's not just a single thing. There's

53
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
like a salient's landscape. Some things stand out more than others. Some things are more

54
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,440
foreground, background. You have all this happening so that you are capable of solving

55
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:05,160
so many problems in a messy, complex world in which there's constant novelty because of an

56
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:10,600
emergent phenomena. And trying to give this ability to machines has been overwhelmingly

57
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:16,600
difficult and one of the hard, hard problems. We're actually bumping up right into it now

58
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,400
as we finally taken up the AGI project, the project of trying to create artificial general

59
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:27,720
intelligence. Excellent. It may be worth digging a little bit deeper into that

60
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:34,840
exposition because people might be thinking, well, don't we just have a module for relevance

61
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:41,400
or salience? Don't we just kind of, we're born and we know, oh, I should not fall off cliffs and I

62
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,520
should, but actually what happened yesterday might be quite irrelevant. You have a wonderful

63
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:53,560
explanation in your sort of keynote paper, Explicating Relevance Realization, where you say

64
00:05:54,280 --> 00:06:01,560
that leads to an infinite regress. Perhaps you could explain that argument.

65
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,680
So the magic module, not to be confused with predictive processing's

66
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,800
reported problem of the magic modulators. So let's keep those two distinct from each other.

67
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:17,400
But the magic module is, well, I have a relevance realization thing in my head that just does it.

68
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:24,040
And then that just, and then I can just say, well, how does it do it? Then the mistake people can

69
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:29,320
make is, well, evolution made it. And that's right. Evolution tells me how it got here.

70
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,720
That's not telling me how it functions. Evolution tells me how my eye got here and

71
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,760
how my ear got here. And that's not telling me how my eye and my ear function. I'm trying to

72
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:43,640
take what's called the design stance. How could, tell me what I need to do to give that module

73
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:48,920
the ability to realize relevance? All you've done is said it has that ability,

74
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:53,960
but it faces the problem of, okay, now it has to know what to pay attention to,

75
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:59,320
and so on and so forth. Now, what you might say is, well, evolution totally prepared us for it.

76
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:05,000
The problem with that is that doesn't work. Evolution can only pick up on things that are

77
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:13,320
long-term invariant and that make an ongoing continuous difference to your reproductive

78
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:20,600
status. And that's not how relevance works. Relevance is really fast and changing. If I say

79
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:25,000
left big toe, it suddenly becomes relevant to you, and it wasn't relevant a minute ago,

80
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,640
and what's the Darwinian difference there? And there's nothing that's intrinsically relevant.

81
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:34,040
Well, my own life is intrinsically relevant, is it? You'll sacrifice your life for your kids.

82
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:39,480
Well, my life and my kids, under all circumstances, saving your kid

83
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:43,800
means that 10 million people, oh, well, and so on, and we get into all these philosophical

84
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:51,640
arguments because we realize, no, no, there isn't any hard, fast thing that is always relevant.

85
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:57,560
Relevance is not something for which we can generate a scientific theory. It's not stable.

86
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:03,960
It's not intrinsic to the phenomenon. And there's nothing, other than being relevant,

87
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:10,440
there's nothing that all the events or objects or feelings have in common. What is it that,

88
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:14,440
what do they all have that makes them, other than saying, well, you'll give me synonyms,

89
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:19,560
they're important to me, or they help me solve my problems? Yes, that's exactly it. But how?

90
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:30,520
Exactly. Perfect. And it's so nice to see how the apparently disparate strands of cognitive

91
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:35,560
science, so Gibsonian affordances for a cognitive science, predictive processing and

92
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:41,160
processing and active inference, align at this path, which is that everything is dynamical.

93
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:46,760
Everything is about this mutual unfolding. There is no rarefied static

94
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:52,840
existence. It's what's relevant to you might not be relevant to me, and there are these dynamic

95
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:59,640
relationships which govern that. Yeah, so that's a great place to start. I think

96
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:06,440
let's now go into the solution, if there is such a solution. And let's start with

97
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:14,600
opponent processing. So this is a term that you use frequently. To a layman audience,

98
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:19,080
it's not clear exactly what it means. So what is opponent processing, and how does it help

99
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:25,160
shed light on this complex problem? Sure. And maybe along the way, I can point out how

100
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:31,800
relevance realization really gives some specific teeth to claims of embodiment from 4-Ecox-I.

101
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,040
Because I'd like the point you made, and maybe we don't have to do it right now,

102
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,720
but I'd like to come back to it, how relevance realization is kind of a glue,

103
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:46,040
they glue together predictive processing and 4-Ecox-I in a powerful way and makes them all,

104
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:51,480
including itself, mutually stronger from that integration. But yeah, the opponent processing,

105
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:57,240
so let's just note something. At many different levels of analysis in your biology,

106
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:02,120
you will find opponent processing at work. I'll take one that's very easy to explain,

107
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:09,160
and people have a ready experience of it. So we are all constantly, mostly unconsciously,

108
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,560
although it's affected by conscious factors, we're constantly recalibrating and adjusting,

109
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:19,400
dare I say it, we're even evolving our level of metabolic arousal. I don't mean just sexual

110
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:24,600
arousal, don't be Freud here, I mean arousal. How much, how much, how sort of activated are you,

111
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:30,360
how sort of energized are you? And the problem is there isn't, there isn't some state,

112
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,800
homeostatic state you're looking for with that, because if there's a tiger in the room, I need to

113
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:43,960
maximal arousal. And if I'm going to sleep, I need to go to minimal arousal, and I can't just be

114
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:48,360
sort of Canadian and keep sort of average arousal at all times, because then I don't fall asleep

115
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:54,120
and I get killed by tigers. And so it constantly has to be, like we're talking about, it has to

116
00:10:54,120 --> 00:11:00,120
constantly be adjusting. So what has evolved in your biology is your autonomic, meaning

117
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:05,480
self-governing, it's a self-organizing system. Like you said, it's a dynamical entity.

118
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:12,280
Your autonomic nervous system, and what it does is it couples together two subsystems that are,

119
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:18,920
have opposite biases from each other. So your sympathetic system is biased to, I'll speak

120
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:23,880
anthropomorphically, just because it speeds things up. Your sympathetic system is biased to seeing

121
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:28,120
as much of it can of the world as threat or opportunity and arousing you as much as it can.

122
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:33,240
And your parasympathetic system is biased the opposite way. It's biased to seeing

123
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:38,840
as much of the world as secure, safe, a place where you can rest and recover. And then these

124
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:44,840
subsystems are not independent from each other. They're locked together, and they're also, they're

125
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:50,600
continually trying to shut each other off. And they're constantly competing that way,

126
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:55,560
but they're cooperatively competing. It's not adversarial, they're cooperatively competing.

127
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:01,880
And what happens is the constant trade-off between those processes, between those processes,

128
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:10,440
constantly, right, in very dynamic manner, constantly recalibrate to your level of arousal

129
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,520
to the world. And that's opponent processing. And what you find is you got that, you know,

130
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:18,440
there's other, there's opponent processing between your focal vision and your peripheral vision.

131
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:24,120
There's opponent processing plausibly between your left and right hemispheres. The number of these

132
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:30,920
things, right, it is huge. And I say at many different levels of analysis. And so

133
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:41,000
I think opponent processing is a clue to how relevance realization is actually undertaken

134
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:49,400
by your embodied cognition. Wonderful. And immediately to anyone interested in active

135
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:55,160
inference or its manifestation in continuous state spaces as predictive processing,

136
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,840
what will be screaming out is this notion of an attractor set or our homeostatic equilibrium,

137
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:07,080
which Karl has spoken about at length, obviously, and has had many other researchers. But this idea

138
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:16,680
that what this, we are, we suffer, but we also embody in a kind of positive way this itinerancy.

139
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:24,360
We never, we're never stuck in a single mode. We are endowed with the capacity to

140
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:29,560
go beyond our homeostasis and return back to it. But we're always, in a sense, being drawn

141
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:34,920
without ever residing, without ever having stopped at that homeostatic set point.

142
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:43,000
So let's now fold in active inference to the picture. What does it provide relevance realization

143
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:49,320
and the formulation of relevance realization that couldn't be done purely with Fourier cognitive

144
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:55,880
science? So, I mean, I'm going to talk about it in terms of predictive processing, because that's

145
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:02,920
the one, that's the formulation of it, that lines up most cleanly with the theoretical

146
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:07,560
integration. As you said, there's there's clear derivation relations between active inference

147
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:13,000
and predictive processing, and also between them and the Bayesian math, but the Bayesian math, if

148
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,760
you were to actually strictly apply it would be computationally intractable. So we're doing some

149
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:21,080
approximation function. So I'm just going to take it that everybody sort of shall knows that I'm

150
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:29,080
playing fair with this, right? I'm not, I'm not trying to be dodgy. And so, relevance realization

151
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:36,600
is grounded in the idea of problem solving. And problem solving actually assumes a fundamental

152
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:41,720
thing, which again is so obvious to us, which is the states you're in and the states you want to

153
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:46,040
be in are not the same state. That's the defining feature of a problem. If I'm in a state I want

154
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:51,800
to be in, I want to be sitting in this chair. I am. I don't have a problem, right? And now,

155
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:59,480
what that means is you're all, you're immediately into something very interesting. The organism is

156
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:08,120
trying to actually predict a possible state in the world and prepare itself, so it's an agent.

157
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:15,960
It doesn't just behave. It alters its behavior to alter the states in the world, right? And so it is

158
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:22,200
trying to, I would say, predictively prepare for the world. It's trying to predict the world, but

159
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:27,480
prepare itself for that world, but also prepare the world so it's more likely to come out in the

160
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:34,120
prediction that it seeks, right? And so I put those two together, and I talk about anticipation.

161
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:41,560
And so whenever you're problem solving, you're anticipating a goal, meaning that prediction

162
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:48,120
and preparation. Now, Fourier coincide doesn't directly talk about that as clear as it needs to.

163
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:54,440
It talks about coupling, and it talks about affordances, and I think there's a deep connection

164
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:59,480
between opponent processing, optimal gripping, and affordances, and maybe we can exploit that

165
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:07,480
at some point. But typically, one of the things where Fourier coincide has some challenges

166
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:14,360
is in more distal relations to the environment, because it tends to rely primarily on coupling.

167
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:18,040
And this is a long-standing critique that one of my colleagues, Brian Cantwell Smith,

168
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,160
at the University of Toronto, because that is where all knowledge is flowing from,

169
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:27,160
right, has made. He said, you know, you can be predictably coupled to things that you're in

170
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:33,960
direct causal contact with, but, you know, sorry, dynamically coupled, not predictably coupled,

171
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:40,280
my apologies. But how do you do things that are much more distal? And for me, that is key.

172
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:48,840
And here's why I do this. I think when we evaluate, even intuitively, so I'm not using that as an

173
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:55,400
authority, I'm just showing how readily this works for us. When we evaluate an organism for

174
00:16:55,400 --> 00:17:00,520
its intelligence, we tend to do it in two interlocking ways. We do it in terms of, I think,

175
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,080
how well does it zero in on relevant information? How well does it pay attention to what it needs?

176
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:09,880
We look at an animal and go, wow, that's really good. Notice how it's noting subtle differences.

177
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:14,520
But we also evaluate the intelligence of an organism, and Michael Levin talks about this

178
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:19,480
with his cognitive light cone idea, is how deeply into the world they can anticipate. And I don't

179
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:25,560
mean just spatio-temporally, I also mean it modally, possibility. Like when I talk to my cat and I say,

180
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:32,280
you know, where's your toy? The cat looks at me and I go, no, well, I say to my puppy,

181
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:37,240
where's your ball? And she goes into the other room, looks for the ball, finds it under the

182
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:43,320
couch and brings it all the way back to me. I go, wow, you're really smart, right? And so we get

183
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:50,200
this because we know how just moment by moment that adaptive ability is built on how distally

184
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:55,320
can we pursue goals? We tend to evaluate people, wow, you pursued a long-term goal and you brought

185
00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:01,400
it up. So that's what's missing. And I think that's what's really afforded. Now, I want to make one

186
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:07,080
more point, and then I'll shut up so you can ask me another question, which is these two issues,

187
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:12,040
anticipating more deeply, and remember, I don't just mean spatio-temporally, I mean modally,

188
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:19,480
and relevance realisation are deeply interconnected. The more you anticipate, the more the problem of

189
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:26,680
relevance realisation goes up exponentially. And so these two things, right, they, I would argue,

190
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:31,400
because they're interlocking, they have to be solved together. And I think that's why we use

191
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,640
both of them as evaluations of the intelligence of an organism.

192
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:44,040
Okay, I'd like to backtrack to that second argument after this, after what I say here.

193
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:53,640
Yeah, it strikes me that what predictive processing can give, perhaps where 4e Cognitive

194
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:59,000
Science doesn't, but I'm happy to be schooled on this. And I know Varela and Autoporesis in some

195
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:05,480
sense pre-shadowed and prefigured what I'm about to say, is that it kind of gives a ground to

196
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:11,560
our action and to our perception, which is that we have to have a model of the world and a model

197
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:17,240
of ourselves, which is not only descriptively viable, but also normatively viable. In so far as,

198
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:23,320
it's all like, it's very important for me to be able to predict the world. But as you said,

199
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:27,560
we aren't just at the behest of the world's dynamics, we can change the world according

200
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:34,840
to our preferences. Exactly. And I think what predictive processing gives us is, although to

201
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:41,880
be fair, I think Carl might say that this is a bit of an overshoot, is a telos, is a fundamental

202
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:47,080
attractor set to which our perception of action is governed. So I think that's kind of the way that

203
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:55,000
I see the added benefit of this convergence between predictive processing and relevance

204
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,800
realization. What I was also going to say there is that it's, fantastically, you're mentioning

205
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:05,000
this kind of deep temporal modeling. Because from my eyes, that's really where a lot of the work

206
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:12,040
is being done right now, which is that selfhood consciousness, even perhaps space itself is

207
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:20,040
downstream on the fact that we can downstream on the degree to which we can model the slower

208
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:27,400
dynamics and the faster dynamics in a generative hierarchy. So that's, I think that's it. I mean,

209
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,600
complete agreement with that. I think that's an extension of the argument I made.

210
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:38,040
And so what I wanted to pick up there is you said, if I heard correctly, that the more,

211
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:43,640
the deeper your temporal model, the more you can model slower fluctuations in the environment,

212
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:48,680
the more critical relevance realization becomes, the higher the stakes in some sense.

213
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:54,760
I'm interested in unpicking that argument, because from my eyes, there are plenty of

214
00:20:54,760 --> 00:21:03,160
things out there that don't have deep temporal models. So a virus, for example, you're just

215
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:09,160
reacting to very coarse-grained features of the environment. But for them, relevance realization,

216
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,800
at least to my eyes, appears as critical as it would for a human.

217
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:18,440
It is. It is. And so I think it's how I'm going to put it, I think it's always the

218
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:28,360
demanding problem. So I'm not denying that even the paramecium has to do salience landscaping.

219
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:33,320
It has to, I'm going to use a word very neutrally here. I'm not connoting anything about consciousness,

220
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:39,240
but it has to recognize this molecule is food and that molecule is poison and swim reliably

221
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:44,360
towards the one and away from the other. So I think the problem is always there,

222
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:49,640
as I was trying to indicate, as soon as you have problems, as soon as your goal states are

223
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:54,200
distinct. And I think the space opens up very quickly exponentially. I just meant that it

224
00:21:54,200 --> 00:22:02,520
exponentially gets worse. This is why you see across species, hyperbolic discounting,

225
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:07,320
temporal discounting, because that's a huge relevance realization machine. It's about

226
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:12,840
salience discounting. And the point of that is, is because as you opened into the future,

227
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:17,960
the number of possibilities goes up exponentially. And so you need to have this attenuation function,

228
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:23,240
so you don't get overwhelmed by the possibilities as you extend your cognition into the future.

229
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:28,600
That's why we have hyperbolic discounting. And we pay a huge price for it. It makes us procrastinate.

230
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:33,160
It makes us difficult to give up, to pursue our long-term goals. So there's even a trade-off

231
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:37,560
relationship in there, but I won't get into it. But that's an example. There's a good reason why we

232
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:42,200
must have something like temporal discounting across species. That's what Angelie showed,

233
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:48,120
is because the relevance realization issue just, it gets even worse. It starts out bad and gets even

234
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:54,920
worse. Right. Wonderful. And yeah, I mean, a lot of your work will come to affordances now because

235
00:22:54,920 --> 00:23:00,040
a lot of your work is centered on the notion of affordances. So affordances are the possibilities

236
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:04,600
for action afforded, actually circular, possibilities for action granted by the environment. I mean,

237
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:11,480
afforded was a verb and then Gibson made it now. How much has the predictive processing

238
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:16,440
framework supplemented your understanding of affordances? And perhaps the way that

239
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:24,520
what we perceive in the world is not necessarily a feature list of objects, but they are fundamentally

240
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:31,560
affordances. I see my glass of water as grippable rather than being glass this dimension. And I

241
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:39,080
only ask that because, as I said, as conscious, animate cognizers, we are blessed with the

242
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:45,400
capacity to change the world in accordance with our priors, which makes action really the fundamental

243
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:53,000
currency for auto poesis, for self-organization. So does it has predicted processing ramped up

244
00:23:53,560 --> 00:24:00,040
the importance that you give to Gibsonian affordances? I don't have it ramped up because I

245
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:06,840
always thought I literally learned this stuff from John Kennedy when it gives his greatest

246
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:14,680
protease. So very early on, I was very much impressed by this. And it occurred to me that

247
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:22,120
relevance realization, the realization of relevance, and I mean realization in both senses,

248
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:26,840
actualizing a possibility and becoming aware of it, or at least detecting it in some fashion,

249
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:32,840
that it's a prototypical kind of affordance. The thing about affordances is they're not found

250
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:38,600
in the object or in the organism. The grippability of the glass is not in the glass, can't be gripped

251
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:46,840
by a peramecium. And it's not in my hand. My hand can't grasp Africa or the sun. It's in a fitted

252
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:52,200
relation between them. And that's exactly what relevance is. It's a fitted relationship between.

253
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:59,560
So I always, before I came into a deep dialogue with predictive processing, I already saw a deep

254
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:05,320
relationship between relevance, realization, and affordances. And I think part of my work has been

255
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:10,760
to really explore the deep ontological significance of that, that we have a category that sort of

256
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:15,800
falls outside. This was Gibson's intent, too. This is what Forde Cogside is really talking about.

257
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:22,760
Falls outside are our belief that we have a complete exhaustive dichotomy between the subjective

258
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:27,160
and the objective, between the inner world and the outer world. And so there's this other important,

259
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:31,480
why call it the transjective, this betweenness, this connectedness, that you see in

260
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:36,920
adeptivity, you see in relevance, but you also see it, like you said. Now, what do I think

261
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:44,360
the predictive processing did? If you'll allow me, I want to talk back and forth symmetrical,

262
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:51,240
not just linear. So I think what the predictive processing does is emphasize the need to try

263
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:59,560
and explain, rather than just... I don't want to be cruel. So I'm being a little bit oversimplistic.

264
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:05,720
I'm doing that just for speed. But generally, it's like, yeah, but how do affordances get actualized

265
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:11,720
in the Ford E-caller? Like, there's a lot of affordances all the time. And what I'm interested

266
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:17,480
is, how do those affordances become, well, salient and obvious to me, so they become

267
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:25,320
binding on my sensory motor behavior. And that was always something of, not that there's Redfield

268
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:30,600
and others who are doing some work on it, but typically they start to invoke predictive processing

269
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:37,080
to try and explain that mechanism of, okay, there's a huge affordance network, but I'm not...

270
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:46,440
Here we go again. How do I select and actualize the ones that actually go into my salience

271
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:51,800
landscaping? And I think predictive processing, especially with the notion of precision waiting,

272
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:56,600
is a good job of that. And what I think relevance realization helps to do to predictive processing,

273
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:01,480
a bunch of other things. But one thing is, predictive processing, basically, there's subtlety

274
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:04,920
to this, and I know there's lots of mouth, but just to keep going, right, that, you know, well,

275
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:09,240
what attention is, is the precision waiting? It's this meta function. And I think that's a

276
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:13,560
very good argument, but there's a conceptual analysis that's been needed, but it's like,

277
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:18,520
but what is salience? And one of the arguments I can make is, well, what the precision waiting is

278
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:24,520
doing is relevance realization. And relevance realization, when relevance realization does

279
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:30,440
a higher order finding relevant of an affordance that has been generated by lower order relevance

280
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:34,600
realization, that's when something becomes salient to us. And so we can actually give a

281
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:40,680
conceptual explanation that goes with the theoretical identity claim in predictive processing,

282
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:45,400
the precision waiting is attention, and what it gives you is salience. So they can, they can

283
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:53,560
unpack each other. I think what another thing that happens is, relevance realization is deeply

284
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:58,120
connected to foreecogside, because relevance is grounded, I would argue, in auto-polisis.

285
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:06,840
Relevance, relevance is always relevant to an organism, right? And so that means,

286
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:11,000
relevance realization is a cold calculation. It's how the organism cares about some more

287
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,040
information rather than all the other information, because it is constantly taking care of itself.

288
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:20,440
There are literally, and I mean this physically, things that matter to it, and things that it

289
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:26,360
must import into itself, important things. And some of that's also information. And so

290
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:33,720
why that, if you, if you can, if you can glue foreecogside and predictive processing together,

291
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:38,680
I think you can answer some of the questions, maybe even challenges, that some people in

292
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:43,400
foreecogside are making of predictive processing and saying, well it's not really connected to

293
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:49,800
embodiment. I think, no, no, if you show a deep theoretical integration of predictive processing

294
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:54,120
and relevance realization, and then relevance realization and auto-polisis, then you've really

295
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:58,760
strongly glued predictive processing and foreecogside together. So that's some of the

296
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:05,560
important theoretical work that you've done. Yeah, absolutely. I would love to jump into

297
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:13,240
the critiques that certain foree cognitive research, cognition researchers have leveraged

298
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:19,240
at predictive processing, but let's leave that for a second. This is exactly what I was talking

299
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:25,800
about in terms of telos, which is that exactly this notion of care. And when I spoke to Mara

300
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:32,120
Albaras in an active inference researcher last week, we kind of actually ended up concluding

301
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:36,600
that this is almost the Heideggerian sense of care that we take from our existence.

302
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:41,800
Can I, can I just interrupt there? Yeah. Right. Heideggerian sense of care was exactly what I

303
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:48,280
was invoking. And I, right, and I was deeply influenced by Dreyfus and the frame problem,

304
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:55,160
got this from Heidegger. Yeah. So the connection you just drew is very, I, I, yeah, I explicitly

305
00:29:55,160 --> 00:30:00,920
argue for that. Excellent. So yeah, I mean, I personally think that the Heidegger, Heideggerian,

306
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:06,360
Dreyfus, Merleau Ponty lineage needs to be integrated more into active inference. And I'm

307
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:12,120
speaking to Dr. Marilyn Stendera, who has done work on Heidegger and auto-poesis. So that will be

308
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:15,320
really, that will be really fun in the upcoming weeks. This is exactly what I was talking about

309
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:19,960
in terms of telos, which is that taking a stance on your own existence can be computationally

310
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:26,760
modeled as having these kind of high precision priors. So our homeostatic set point will be

311
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:31,560
different from a snake's. And that actually gives a really solid explication of why we act

312
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:36,760
differently in certain contexts than snakes. And so that was my kind. But then that said,

313
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:42,840
I will have to make clear that Carl is in himself, although he has spoken about existential imperative

314
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:48,200
says that there actually is no imperative. All that you're really saying is if a thing like us

315
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:53,320
is to persist over time, this is what it needs to do. And it's just a, it's just cast as a

316
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:58,920
minimization of free energy. So I think there's an interesting question there that maybe you

317
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:04,600
could have a go at, which is to what degree do you see this as a genuine imperative versus

318
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:12,200
just what things do to self-organize over time? Yeah. And so I mean, and Carl's no

319
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:18,040
slope, so he's welcome. I sometimes don't like it when people who, you know, are physicists or

320
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:23,560
something start commenting on philosophical normative questions with an authority they

321
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:30,920
don't properly possess. But I know Carl's a great theorist. And I know he's philosophically educated.

322
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,520
I have not yet to talk to him, but I hope I do get to do so.

323
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:44,120
We can do ahead. So yeah, I mean, so I'm going to argue later if I get a chance that what

324
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:50,440
relevance realization doing is strongly analogous, obviously a very different timescale to what

325
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:57,480
evolution does about constantly redesigning the adapted fittedness of the, of organisms to the

326
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:02,520
environment and allowing organisms to fit their environments to them. Because as you keep emphasizing

327
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:07,720
and I keep agreeing with, it's not passive. It's not right. The organism is shaping the

328
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:11,480
environment as the environment is shaping the organism, niche construction and all that sort

329
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:16,840
of thing. And I think that's all right. And then there again, that's a very clear connection to

330
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:21,960
40 cogside again. But this deeper question, I do want to do it. I want to pause and I want to

331
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:30,280
slow down because it is a really important question. Because it gets us beyond what we might call

332
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:38,440
scientific explanations of how and into properly, but not useless, philosophical reflection of sort

333
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:44,360
of why. And why does this matter to me? Because as you've mentioned, I'm deeply concerned with,

334
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:52,120
you know, issues of meaning in life. This, this, this largely metaphorical, nebulous notion that

335
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:59,160
humans seek meaningful lives, lives that are worth living, even given all of our failures and our

336
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:05,160
faults and our flaws and our foolishness and our frustration, right? And pretty clear empirical

337
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:12,440
evidence that it's not reducible to just subjective well-being or pleasure and pretty good conceptual

338
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:16,680
philosophical argument, because that's where it's relevant, that it's not reducible to just living

339
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:21,000
a moral existence. You could live a very moral existence in which you're sort of experiencing

340
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:27,160
the pleasure of food and other things. And, and, and you've got, you know, certain stability in

341
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:32,200
your environment that you could be very, very lonely. You could be very lonely. So, and what,

342
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:35,720
what that loneliness points to, I'm just making an intuitive gesture. That's not a tight argument.

343
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:40,920
I have tight arguments, but the gesture is people are seeking a kind of connectedness. And now you

344
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:45,400
see where I'm getting to relevance realization and what we're talking about this niche construction,

345
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:51,000
the fittedness, the belonging togetherness, this mutually shaping, like this is this,

346
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,920
I argue that that's exactly the connectedness human beings are seeking the meaning in life.

347
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:01,960
Now, you can then ask the question and people, and I'm going to play with two

348
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:06,440
terms of phrase here to play with that. I think we clearly seek meaning in life.

349
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:12,520
I think the evidence for that is growing and it converges with the psychological work on

350
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:18,760
meaning in life and on what Karen Allen calls belongingness. If you don't feel that you belong,

351
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:23,480
you're in trouble and you're in trouble across all these measures, cognitive, emotional, social,

352
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:29,640
financial, blah, you're in trouble, physiologically you're in trouble. That's why solitary confinement

353
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:37,160
is such a punishment, right? So, is there a meaning of life to the meaning in life?

354
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:47,640
The meaning of life is that is there some sort of cosmic destiny, cosmic order to which we are

355
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:55,000
which we are ultimately trying to find. And here's the thing, I don't think I have enough evidence

356
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:02,040
for that. I think that there's lots of evidence for meaning in life and if I'm right that it's

357
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:08,920
relevance realization and if that's something very much like evolution, right? Evolution is

358
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:17,000
constantly redesigning adeptivity, but there isn't a final thing that evolution is aiming towards.

359
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,800
There isn't a final form of life. There isn't some like what we're doing is

360
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:28,520
like the sculptor, we're constantly refining and then finally one day we will have the final

361
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:35,160
form of life. And I think this is fundamentally flawed and I think this matters philosophically.

362
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:42,760
I don't think previous forms of life were in some in any kind of moral sense superior to us.

363
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:48,040
So, I don't believe in any nostalgias. Some of the previous things that people found important

364
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:52,680
and relevant and sacred, those were the true ones and we just have to get back there. Nope.

365
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:58,520
And I don't believe the utopia. We are working towards the final ultimate thing that will all

366
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:05,240
agree for all time is the most relevant, most salient. I don't believe that's how this works.

367
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:13,800
So, I reject nostalgias. I reject utopias. The idea that there's a telos can either mean

368
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:19,080
there's a telos to meaning in life, which is it's like Carl says, it's necessary,

369
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:24,120
it's constitutive necessary for living things to have this. But does that mean there's any

370
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:30,920
metaphysical necessity to their being living things? That's a different question. Now, here's my

371
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:36,280
weak answer at that one. Sorry. Long question, but you asked like this is like almost up there

372
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:45,160
with like God. Yeah. Right. Right. I note that I'm in a very difficult situation. I can't see any

373
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:51,640
evidence for and I'm not attacking God here. And as you know, I'm very respectful and even

374
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:57,400
appreciative of religious frameworks and religious lives. But I can't see any evidence for that.

375
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:04,280
However, if you were to ask me, which is a better universe, one with life in it and one without

376
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:09,560
life in it, even if you couldn't exist in either one, I would say the one with life in it. There's

377
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:16,280
some primordial judgment going on there that has some kind of metaphysical import. Now, it's weak.

378
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:23,800
I admitted that ahead of time. And so I'm giving you a very, I'm sorry, very long but wishy-washy

379
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:30,040
answer. I don't really think I believe in anything like the meaning of life, but I do think there's

380
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:37,960
a metaphysical import to being connected to reality. We find reality being connected to reality

381
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:42,920
inherently valuable for its own sake. And we find worlds in which things can realize reality

382
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:49,400
better worlds than ones that don't have that in it. That's my answer. No, it's a wonderful answer.

383
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:55,080
And it, it's really helped me and hopefully our audience clarify exactly what I mean by

384
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:59,320
an existential imperative, which is that the free energy principle doesn't tell you

385
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:06,520
what you're here for. No, it tells you if you're here, what are you doing? Like I've given your

386
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:15,080
phenotype and given your culture and etc, etc. So that's a really useful sort of explanation

387
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:20,120
of exactly what I was going for there. And actually, it points to something I said to

388
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:25,080
Carl right at the end of our podcast, which at the time of recording this came out yesterday. So

389
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:29,320
people should definitely check it out because he's, for sure, for sure, he's on top form,

390
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:36,600
which is that I asked him, I mentioned Thomas Nagel. So Thomas Nagel has this very romantic

391
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:42,760
philosophical notion that life is deaf is bad because life is fundamentally good. And it points

392
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:47,800
to kind of your thought experiment. If we had two worlds, one with life and one without life,

393
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:52,040
I think we would all intuitively say the one with life is better. Whether that has any

394
00:38:52,040 --> 00:39:00,520
metaphysical input, as you say, is up for grabs. I was going to ask sort of jumping on the back

395
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:05,720
of the initial thing you said, which was about connectedness and belongingness. So if we take

396
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:09,640
this from a theoretical or computational stance and active inference, what this looks like to me

397
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:16,120
is we embody a model of the world which we can so we can make fundamentally sound predictions

398
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:20,840
about how the world will unfold and how about we will and how we will act to make that world more

399
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:28,680
compatible with our preferences. Now, when that was formalized initially in the active inference

400
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:33,560
literature, immediately a response to this came in the form of what's called the dark room problem.

401
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:38,920
So this is sort of papers in 2011, 2012, and they've been rebutted in multiple ways. But the

402
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,760
basic idea is why don't humans just seek out dark rooms where maybe they have access to food and

403
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:50,840
water, but they don't really seek out, but in a state where they don't go and explore and they're

404
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:54,760
not curious. Because what you're saying there is actually a perfect coupling between your predictions

405
00:39:54,760 --> 00:40:00,760
of the world and the way the world is unfolding to your eyes. So I was wondering whether you had

406
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:11,080
pondered the dark room problem and where you see exploration and epistemic affordances coming into

407
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:17,720
play here. Yeah, I think that the dark room problem, I'm not, I'm happy with all the other

408
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:22,920
rebuttals. And I don't know, I don't know, I don't know them all, so I may be stepping on somebody

409
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:32,440
else's toes. So if I am, whoever you are, I apologize. I think this is a lock-in individualist

410
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:39,560
model of cognition and how we work. And I think it is therefore the presupposition, well, is that no,

411
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:45,560
that's actually, I don't agree with that presupposition, that our cognition is fundamentally

412
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:54,280
individualistic in that way. I think we are, you know, we are socio-social cultural mammals.

413
00:40:54,920 --> 00:41:01,160
And let me point to one thing, you know, yes, measures of G are very robustly predictive,

414
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:05,480
but you know, it's also really a very powerful way of predicting your behavior,

415
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:12,920
your attachment style. This is also very robust. Now, that means, think about what that actually

416
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:16,680
means. And this, you know, and this goes into the heart of religious traditions, like agopic love,

417
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:22,520
right? When you have a child, you have to invert your relevance arrow. It's not how

418
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:28,440
that being is relevant to you. You invert everything around. This is agopic love,

419
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:33,480
and it's how it's different from erotic love or philea love. You invert everything around,

420
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:38,600
right? And so that it's, how am I relevant to this being? How am I relevant to this being? And

421
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:44,680
how can I be relevant in a way that turns it into a person, turns it into an intelligent,

422
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:51,720
rational, self-reflective, relevance-realizer, predictive processor, meaning maker, right?

423
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:57,400
And so, well, first of all, where are my attachment relationships in the dark room? Well,

424
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:00,840
there's other people in the dark room. As soon as there's other people in the dark room, all the

425
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:05,800
problems that you thought you got away from by putting me in a dark room return. Other people

426
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:10,040
have different goals than me. They have different needs. They're going to move around differently,

427
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:13,560
right? That we're going to have to decide about when and where and how we gain access,

428
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:18,200
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. All of that immediately unfolds. Secondly, and this is part

429
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:25,000
of 4E CogSight, I think the evidence for extended cognition, distributed cognition,

430
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:31,400
that we evolve to work in groups, and the collective intelligence of that is actually

431
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:37,480
our superpower, and other people are making this argument. I think that's clear. The standard thing,

432
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:42,760
take the Waste and Selection Task, put it an individual person, highly educated, highly

433
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:49,480
intelligent, second-year psychology and top-tier university. From the 1960s on, you put them

434
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:55,000
in the Waste and Selection Task, and only 10% get it right, right? You replace that same task

435
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:00,520
with four people who are allowed to talk to each other, and their success rate goes from 10% to

436
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:07,640
82% reliably. Why? Because we do opponent processing between each other. You have biases

437
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:13,400
different from mine, and if we work in opponent processing, not adversarial, but if I say,

438
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:17,080
you're probably a good source for correcting my bias, and I'm probably a good source for correcting

439
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:25,560
yours, we get the best dynamical self-correction possible. When you add in the fact of the reality,

440
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:30,120
and there's actually evidence, empirical and formal, for the power of collective intelligence,

441
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:35,800
the reality of attachment, well, then the dark room becomes filled with other people

442
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:41,240
who are trying to band together to solve problems that they can't solve individually, and then,

443
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:48,440
to me, everything that the dark room thought it had as an absurdity, like a reductioid absurdum,

444
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:52,760
disappears. That would be my response. Yeah, I think eventually the dark room just becomes the

445
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:58,840
world once you start asking the things you need, eventually it becomes a civilization.

446
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:03,800
Yeah, I love all this stuff on distributed cognition. I spent the first six months of this

447
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:09,880
year working at UCL on finding experimental ground for what's called social baseline theory.

448
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:15,240
Social baseline theory is this idea that humans, like to study a human being in a lab by itself is

449
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:22,520
to study a human being at deficit. Yes. Actually, it's physiological arousal to take one factor

450
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:27,320
is at its baseline when it's with other people, and it will fluctuate according to stuff like

451
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:31,960
attachment style or the relationship that one has with that person, which is really beautiful,

452
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:37,000
but inverts our kind of, well, maybe not common sense, but our institutionalized notion of what

453
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:42,520
it is to be a person, which is kind of alone. Yeah, wonderful. Well, I'm going to take this

454
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:47,880
argument a little bit further if you let me, because this is something that we spoke about a

455
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:51,640
couple of months ago, and I think Mark might have a different opinion, so it'd be cool to

456
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:59,080
unpickle this. I have this slightly fuzzy, wishy-washy idea that the notion that, okay,

457
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:05,480
so I always think about a climber climbing a rock face or a climbing wall. The climbing wall is a

458
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:11,240
kind of beautiful canonical example of an affordance based landscape. It's rich for the affordances.

459
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:17,720
It's got the toe holes, the finger holes. So in many ways, what the rock, in terms of active

460
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:23,960
inference, what it allows the rock climber to do is to self-evidence or find evidence for its own

461
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:30,760
model about itself as a successful rock climber. Now, that's relatively well established in the

462
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:36,040
literature. What isn't established is my kind of, again, slightly wishy-washy idea, which is that

463
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:43,480
the rock climber is offering affordances to the wall. And so this is why, right at the beginning

464
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:48,120
of our conversation, I spoke about mutual coupling. So what dynamical systems theory gives us,

465
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:54,840
what auto-polysis gives us, what active inference gives us, is this idea that to exist is not to

466
00:45:54,840 --> 00:46:00,920
be this kind of reified self that takes a objective stance on the world. And actually, what it is,

467
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:06,200
is this really the fundamental unit of analysis should be this dynamic mutual coupling between

468
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:12,120
agent and arena to use your terminology. I've spoken to Mark about this, and he

469
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:17,400
said it's something like an overextension of the term affordances, to say that the human being is

470
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:21,320
offering affordances to the climbing wall. I know Mark isn't here to defend himself, so again, I'm

471
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:26,280
not going to put one... But I will definitely raise this with him again. But just to your own

472
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:32,120
ears, how does that argument sound to you? I like the argument, and yeah, I don't want to speak

473
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:37,720
to you, but Mark, I'll only speak to the propositions that you spoke on his behalf. And I'm very happy

474
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:42,840
to... I mean, Mark and I work close together. Mark is one of the best people I know.

475
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:50,280
Mark's a former student of mine. I'm very proud of Mark, so... But I actually agree with you. Now,

476
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:56,680
that goes to another connection I make in my work that would probably be a little bit stranger

477
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:00,760
to the ears of many of your listeners. They might say, oh, I get why he wants to connect

478
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:06,760
to process inter-relevance realization and the 40-card side. But now what you're doing,

479
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:10,680
and this is where I do a lot of what I call my deeper ontological work, and this is where the

480
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:16,600
Heideggerian stuff really comes to bear, is this is all the work I do on neoplatonism,

481
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:24,120
which may sound like something very arcane. But again, here's the proposal that once we

482
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:30,520
really profoundly accept affordances, and once we accept that they are reciprocally realizing,

483
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:35,160
I agree with you, that affordance not only discloses things about me, it discloses things

484
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:40,760
about the world. And that's a way in which things, like Heidegger's notion of truth is alifea,

485
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:47,240
as an event, as the disclosure, rather than a static property of our propositions.

486
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:53,320
I think that, bang on, now, as Filler argues, and I've been arguing for a while, and John Russen,

487
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:58,680
Filler's book is called Neoplatonism, Heidegger and the History of Being, Relation as Ontological

488
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:05,480
Ground, that relationality is actually the ultimate nature of reality. Heidegger is actually turning

489
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:09,880
back towards this, because what does that give you? If you have that, and I think this is a fair

490
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:15,480
way to put it, if you have that alethetic notion of affordance, then you are getting back to the

491
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:21,400
neoplatonic theory of knowing by conformity, knowing by participation, and the deeper argument

492
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:28,360
goes something like this, that if the fundamental grammar of your cognition, I don't mean the content,

493
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:34,680
your content can go wrong, but if the fundamental grammar, the bottom up, top down, all this stuff

494
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:40,280
we're talking about, if it's not picking up on something fundamental about how reality is structured,

495
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:46,600
right, then you face the kind of profound solipsism, a profound kind of skepticism.

496
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:52,920
And I think that is ultimately leads you into all kinds of performative contradictions that I

497
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:57,000
and I agree with Whitehead, there is devastating as propositional contradiction.

498
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:01,720
There's a longer argument there, and I could point to, please check out some of my talks

499
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:08,040
on YouTube about this longer argument, like Pickstock's Aspects of Truth, where she said,

500
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:13,080
all the things we use to decodemize this, we had the analytic synthetic distinction,

501
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:18,680
that is broken down under philosophical criticism. We had the theory fact distinction,

502
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:23,400
that is broken down. We had the, like, is, ought, that has broken down.

503
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:28,520
Like, think about the relevance, it is or not, well, blah, right, it's sort of both, right?

504
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:33,640
And so her point is all the things that were used to cleave, and then what we tried to do

505
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:38,120
is we tried to make the logical world, the thing that sort of stuck the two worlds together,

506
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:45,560
and that collapsed under Godel and other people. And so we're back to the idea that we either go

507
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:51,640
into the Lockean cabinet, in which we're locked inside of our heads, we're somehow getting postcards

508
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:56,040
sent to us, we think they might be from an outside world that we think might be out there,

509
00:49:56,040 --> 00:50:01,320
and we're trying to build it from the postcards, and we're doomed, that's never going to get us there.

510
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:08,600
And so I think if you have an allothetic notion of affordance, you start to make the argument

511
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:14,760
that how reality is realizing, and how we are doing relevance realization, are fundamentally

512
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:24,760
participating in the same principles in a profound way. And I think, yeah, I have no doubt that Mark

513
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:31,000
might not want to do this. I think Mark would be, I would agree with Mark that this is not a direct

514
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:36,920
derivation from sort of classic Christonian presentations of active inference and predicted

515
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:45,000
processing, Bayesian brain, we should settle on a name. But I think if you make the connections

516
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:52,600
through deeper into Gibson, deeper into Foricog side, deeper into Heidegger, you get back to this

517
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:57,960
notion that with the prevalent notion of knowing, that when we know something, what we're doing is

518
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:03,800
our structural functional organization is identifying with the structural functional

519
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:10,840
organization of the thing. And we are both participating in that same form, that same

520
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:17,960
principle, that same grammar. And that has all kinds of metaphysical and ontological consequences,

521
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:23,160
even ethical consequences. It means talking about the truth of good and the beautiful becomes

522
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:29,160
something very relevant again. Yeah, yeah, no, this is exactly where I wanted to go and exactly

523
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:33,240
aligns with the way I'm thinking about the free energy principle at the moment,

524
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:38,840
which is I have a skepticism between the internal and the external distinction.

525
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:44,360
Yes, it's something I spoke about with so a classic problem when one starts reading active

526
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:52,120
inference, as I spoke about with Carl, is whether one would consider the the agent or the internal

527
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:58,200
dynamics is having having a model of the external world or instantiating a model of the external

528
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:04,600
world. Yes, excellent, excellent. And since it's come back to sort of cybernetic formulations

529
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:09,320
of what it is to be a good regulator. So Colin Ashby and all of that stuff from the 50s and 60s.

530
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:15,000
So I have an inherent skepticism because I would I kind of take the stance that actually all that

531
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,720
the internal dynamics are doing is instantiating a particularized form of the external dynamics.

532
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:25,000
And this is very easy once you take out the picture of a homunculized ego. Just if you look at it in

533
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:33,880
terms of just the particle physics, we're just a instantiation of some of the physics that defines

534
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:39,400
everything else. But we just we just actually seem to have a kind of complexified Markov blanket or

535
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:44,600
Markov blanket form of that. But there's nothing particularly distinct about that. And we'll come

536
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:49,880
to consciousness because maybe there is. And that I guess is the big elephant in the room here.

537
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:56,840
But it's funny that you mentioned Heidegger because Heidegger to my to my eyes, and in my

538
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:02,840
opinion, and then obviously Dreyfus and Merleau Ponty and the phenomenologists followed Heidegger,

539
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:12,200
really, he's the one who strikes at this established distinction between a subject and an object.

540
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:17,560
So the Cartesian distinction. And then this is where his kind of gripes with Sartre came in.

541
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:27,000
Now, my question is, is that, yes, if you read Heidegger, Dasein, the ground of Dasein is this

542
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:33,160
kind of interrelationality. Alpha is the disclosure of truth in an interrelational relationship,

543
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:41,160
so to speak. But there still seems to be some kind of subject who, you know, the the hammerer who

544
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:45,720
is hammering away at the nail. Now, from the perspective of the hammerer, he's not some

545
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:53,160
reified ego who is objectifying the nail that all that is really being witnessed there from the

546
00:53:53,160 --> 00:54:00,520
level of consciousness is the disclosure of activity. But still, we can give a description of a hammerer

547
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:08,440
and a nail. So to what degree in your thinking, do you completely eradicate the subject object

548
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:13,640
distinction? And is there anything that you think predictive processing has to say about that?

549
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:17,800
I think, well, the second question.

550
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:27,800
I'm happy to think about it with you. I have put a lot of thought into the first question.

551
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:34,920
And so, I mean, I think Filler is right in his book that our subjective objective divide is our

552
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:40,920
version of the appearance reality distinction. And it's just our version. In the ancient world,

553
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:45,000
they had a different version. So ours is an in out metaphor. How is the inner and the outer

554
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:49,640
connected? And the ancient world is the problem of the one in the midi. How is the lower and the

555
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:56,520
upper connected? And once you see that, you realize that there's a deeper structural problem that

556
00:54:56,520 --> 00:55:03,960
isn't bound to the inner outer or the emergence and the emanation. It's the connectivity issue.

557
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:13,160
And what Filler argues, and there's a lot of other people converging on this, is if you try to,

558
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:18,600
if you go with an Aristotelian metaphysics, or that what's most real are substances in the

559
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:25,240
Aristotelian sense, which are things that can independently exist, then this becomes a big

560
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:30,760
problem for you. And that kind of ontology, I would argue, and I can make the argument,

561
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:37,320
drives you towards a nominalistic epistemology. And then you get, you know, Occam's version of it,

562
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:42,920
or Kant's version of it, where all of the patterns and all the information are just in the mind,

563
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:48,920
which means the mind is radically other, because it is the only place that the information

564
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:56,040
intelligibility actually exists. And the world is profoundly absurd in a deep, deep way. And I

565
00:55:56,040 --> 00:56:02,520
think that leads you into, well, first of all, it makes science impossible. And it leads you into

566
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:09,480
all kinds of existential and moral dilemmas. And if you then take a look at the logic of trying to

567
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:14,360
get, you can't actually, and this is what Filler does very carefully, you can't actually get relations

568
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:20,920
out of properties that belong to the Relata. The relation has to precede the Relata in a very

569
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:28,360
important way. So I think there's a deep, at a very deep level, I do want to call it into question.

570
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:38,120
I do want to challenge that. First of all, it's historical. It's cultural. We pretend as if

571
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:42,920
that is the only way in which human beings have related to the world. Like I said, even in the

572
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:47,320
West, that's not their problem in the ancient world. Their problem is the problem of the one in

573
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:52,120
the many. It's not the problem of being in the world. Now, what does this all ground in? I think

574
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:57,080
this grounds in the common problem of the relationship between appearance and reality. And

575
00:56:57,080 --> 00:57:01,320
here's where I could now say something that aligns with my previous argument about relationality.

576
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:07,720
See, so, and I'm going to borrow a term from rapport here, the hermeneutics of suspicion. The

577
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:12,520
hermeneutics of suspicion is that a parent, and we got it because of Freud and Nietzsche and

578
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:16,360
blah, blah, blah. There's historical reasons. And those are valuable critiques, by the way.

579
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:21,080
But the hermeneutics of suspicion says that appearances are distorting. They're deceptive.

580
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:26,840
They're destructive, right? They're disruptive. And what we should do is always question whether

581
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:34,120
or not they are leading us into reality. Now, Marlo Ponte has a great argument against that,

582
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:42,600
that he gets from, maybe he doesn't get, but it's in Plato, which is, wait, you're treating real like

583
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:47,720
red. Like, you could just say, if you could look at an isolated thing and say that's real.

584
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:53,560
But real is a comparative term. So, of course, is illusion. To say this is an illusion is to say

585
00:57:53,560 --> 00:58:00,680
this is an illusion in comparison, in relation to something that is more real. And that thing

586
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:06,520
is in relation, so on and so forth, right? And what that means is, first of all, you have to see

587
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:12,680
that those judgments are inherently relational. And secondly, you have to call into question

588
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:20,760
the independence of the hermeneutics of suspicion. The hermeneutics of suspicion is actually

589
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:27,720
parasitic on the hermeneutics of beauty. It depends on there being things that we agree on

590
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:33,960
by saying that's where appearance discloses reality rather than distorting it, right?

591
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:40,200
And then as soon as you do that, that undercuts the deep divide, because you ultimately make these

592
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:45,240
divisions between the one and the many, or the subject and the object, by getting a hermeneutics

593
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:49,880
of suspicion into the appearance reality distinction. That's at least the argument I would make.

594
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:59,560
Interesting. Yeah, I like the suspicion of binary-ness inherent in all of this. It speaks

595
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:02,600
to me, and I think it speaks to people who are interested in active inference, and the notion

596
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:09,080
of sort of philosophical vagueness as well. At what point is something real? It's fundamentally

597
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:16,680
a comparative term in the web of things that could be considered real. Yeah. That's right.

598
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:25,400
Yeah. I'm trying to do this without invoking a binary, but you mentioned earlier that four

599
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:31,640
E cognitive scientists do have their critiques of active inference and predictive processing.

600
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:37,320
I will stick with active inference actually for now, and I will explain why later. It's not that

601
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:47,080
interesting. So this is people like Tony Camaro or Ed Bags who are radical inactivists, and what

602
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:55,000
they're critiquing, in a sense, is an interdelist picture of active inference. Again, I'm not putting

603
00:59:55,080 --> 01:00:02,600
words into people's mouths, but if you read Jacob Howey's 2016 paper about self-evidencing,

604
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:09,880
some of the language may to some people imply that there is a homunculus that has a representational

605
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:19,960
picture of the world. This, to the ears of an inactivist, is deeply worrying. I would love to,

606
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:25,240
as a four E cognitive scientist with obviously a vested interest in predictive processing as well,

607
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:31,560
I'd love to just hear your take on that debate and, again, without striking up binaries,

608
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:35,240
and whether you think those critiques are legitimate.

609
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:40,680
Well, I mean, it depends what you mean by legitimate. I mean, there's also the ones

610
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:45,800
that Evan Thompson made, and I hold Evan in a very high regard. I mean, they're legitimate in that

611
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:52,680
they are well-made arguments in peer-reviewed journals, and so we have no right to be dismissive

612
01:00:52,680 --> 01:01:01,720
of them. Well, if I was to say that let's take as an axiom of active inference. This isn't your case,

613
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:07,480
but let's just say, for sake of argument, that you have some interdelist representations of a

614
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:13,160
statistical model. So you are, in a sense, you're not just embodying a model. You actually have a

615
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:18,360
model. So again, it comes back to that distinction we're talking about. Would an inactivist critique

616
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:22,520
of that internalism be justified?

617
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:34,280
So the reason I'm hesitating is this is landing on the swamp of what do we mean by representation,

618
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:42,760
which, I mean, so does the thermostat represent the temperature in the environment?

619
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:48,760
And everything I'm going to say is controversial because of the swamp. So I want that understood,

620
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:58,520
please. I would say no, because what's needed is there might be some, there might be co-variation,

621
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:05,560
but what I think the critiques of the co-variation model of representation locks ultimately model.

622
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:11,240
So we had the idea that representations have to be similar to what they represent. That's how they

623
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:15,960
represent. And then you have all the problems with similarity and Aristotle even could bring that down.

624
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:21,720
And then lock replaced it with the co-variation model. To have a representation is I have something

625
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:25,960
in my head that reliably co-varies with something in the world, and that's how it represents it.

626
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:32,280
And then the problem with the co-variations is they don't give you the specificity, for example,

627
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:39,800
of thought. So this is co-varying with a bottle, with a tool, with a man-made object. Which is it?

628
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:45,720
Those are not the same things. Those are not the same ideas, but this is co-varying causally with

629
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:52,680
all of that. And you have the problem then of aspectualization. And the Lockian answer, of

630
01:02:52,680 --> 01:03:01,560
course, is we get aspects by doing representation. But I agree with Searle that that's the wrong

631
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:09,400
way around, that any representation is inherently aspectual. When I represent this as a bottle,

632
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:15,080
I'm only picking up on some of its properties insofar as they are relevant to each other,

633
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:21,720
insofar as they are relevant to me. So representation depends on aspectualization,

634
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:26,120
which depends on relevance realization. And this is not what you do with relevance

635
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:32,120
realization. You do not represent all the facts, judge them to be irrelevant, and then zero in.

636
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:38,920
So it's ultimately non-representational. So what I would say is, I don't know that some level,

637
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:46,600
there's something like representations. But if I agree with many arguments that representations

638
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:53,880
are more than co-variation, but there's this kind of caretness and aspectualization through them,

639
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:59,240
then they depend on relevance realization, which grounds an autopolicist and is deeply

640
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:05,080
intertwined with predictive processing. That would be my response.

641
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:12,360
Splendid. And I guess what intuitively supports a more representationist picture is consciousness.

642
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:17,240
I think consciousness is going to become a recurring theme in this podcast.

643
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:26,280
Well, it's the Holy Grail, right? It is the Holy Grail. And so I guess my question here is,

644
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:33,960
is that if one was to adopt a radically inactivist view, there's nothing in that picture which

645
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:39,160
needs consciousness. So why couldn't my mutual coupling with the world just happen with the

646
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:45,000
lights off? So this is an argument, I guess, that's rooted in Chalmers 1995 paper, which is,

647
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:51,400
you can give me the function, but you can't give me the why, why are the lights on? And so I guess,

648
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:58,200
in other words, my question too is, yes, that we may have relevance realization,

649
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:09,880
preceding perception or grounding perception. Then why do we have perception in the first place?

650
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:18,920
So again, I'm going to give a gist of an argument that I've spoken about at length elsewhere,

651
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:23,080
and I'm trying to get published on and presented at conferences and so forth. So

652
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:29,320
I don't think you can separate the function and the nature questions, which is what

653
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:35,400
Chalmers Hard Problem relies on. Yeah, you've given me the function, but you've told me nothing

654
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:39,480
about the nature. I don't think function works ontologically like that. I think function has

655
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:43,640
to be plugged into the ontology. And I think as soon as we're talking about the ontology of

656
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:48,520
anything within a living organism, we're talking about something functional. So I think the questions

657
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:54,680
have to be answered interconnected. So let's go back. Let's say that you give me

658
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:03,800
that any cognitive agent has to be doing anticipatory relevance realization, or it's

659
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:08,440
not going to be a general problem solver. And then when it's doing that, it has to be

660
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:19,400
aspectualizing its world. It's not doing all of this, but this as a bottle or the molecule

661
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:25,560
as food, the molecule. And then if you then start to pay attention to,

662
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:34,040
let's look at the continuum of consciousness. Let's look at the possibility, which I have

663
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:37,880
experienced. That's not even the right sentence. Many people have, and this is Foreman's idea,

664
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:43,720
of something like the pure consciousness event. And the pure consciousness event doesn't have,

665
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:49,400
well, actually, I need a distinction here. I'm going to claim it doesn't have one type of

666
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:54,520
qualia, but it has another type of qualia in it. It doesn't have adjectival qualia. There's no red,

667
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:59,320
there's no blue, there's no cap, there's no dot. You're not even conscious of consciousness,

668
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:07,320
you're just conscious. But what it still has, is it still has the adverbial qualia.

669
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:15,320
It still has a sense of here-ness, noun, and the here-ness is profound presence. That's the language

670
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:23,640
with you. The now-ness, eternity, the integration, right, the together-ness, it's everything is one.

671
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:29,800
So all the adverbial qualia are still there, and you still have consciousness. That shows

672
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:35,880
that the adjectival qualia are not necessary to consciousness. Now, I have the other arguments

673
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:41,080
to show they're probably not sufficient, because if I give you sort of atomic blips of blue-ness

674
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:45,320
and green-ness, and they're not bound together, and there's not a here-ness and a noun-ness,

675
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:53,080
so you can anyway orient on them, I don't think you have consciousness either. So I'm not saying that

676
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:58,840
adjectival qualia don't exist. I'm saying that we've held consciousness hostage to them. And

677
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:06,440
what I'm proposing to you is that what consciousness is doing is these adverbial qualia,

678
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:15,000
which are just salience, which is just relevance realization, which is, as far as we can tell,

679
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:20,040
tied to the best evidence we have, it's all controversial, about the function of consciousness.

680
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:24,200
It's tied up with working memory and attention, which are both doing higher order relevance

681
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:29,880
realization. We seem to need consciousness for situations of complexity, novelty, or ill-defined

682
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:34,280
in this, ones that are really demanding on relevance realization. So you can make a pretty,

683
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:39,080
and there's a lot of convergence, actually, on what the function of consciousness is,

684
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:43,800
relevance realization. And I think if you plug in relevance realization, you can at least get

685
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:50,040
all the adverbial qualia. And that, I think, gives you a lot of what consciousness actually is.

686
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:57,000
Cool. Yeah, let's stay on that adverbial qualia, because I'd like to integrate what you've just

687
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:02,760
said with a more active inference account of consciousness, which there are, and then they're

688
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:11,160
also diverse. But one, well, I have to ask a question before, does Foreman say that mind-ness,

689
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:17,560
so feeling that this experience is mine, does he, is that one of his adverbial qualia that

690
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:24,440
persists in the pure consciousness event? So that has another thicket, because the debate about,

691
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:29,000
this is a raging debate. Evan Thompson actually has a good anthology on this, on the self-no-self

692
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:41,960
debate. Right. And I think it's reasonable and complies with most of the evidence, which

693
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:47,480
of course is self-report after the fact, which is problematic, blah, blah, blah, blah. I agree

694
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:51,800
with all of that. I'm not dismissing that. But that's what we basically have to go on right now,

695
01:09:52,520 --> 01:10:03,240
that the ego narrative sense of mine and me and I goes away. Whether or not that is a complete loss

696
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:18,360
of the self as where relevance realization is happening or something like that. I'm not convinced

697
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:24,200
that that second thing is the case. I think, so if you would allow me, and this is a torture

698
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:28,840
distinction, a distinction between the ego and the self, I think these experiences very much,

699
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:34,040
the ego goes away. I'm very suspicious of the claim that the self goes away, because people are

700
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:39,880
readily able to recall these experiences. This is what Forman does report, and I would report to you

701
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:45,560
and seamlessly integrate them into their auto-noenic autobiographical memory. There isn't any weird

702
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:50,520
disjarring or where was I during that? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, excellent. The reason I asked

703
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:57,400
that is because a lot of self-modeling in active inference is based on the work of Thomas Metzinga.

704
01:10:57,480 --> 01:11:01,960
So, Thomas Metzinga is such a wonderful addition to this conversation. I had a wonderful conversation

705
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:08,840
with him not that long ago. Oh, really? I love it. But on my show. Amazing. I think he's such an

706
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:15,000
underrated and important philosopher. Oh, I totally agree. Yeah, yeah. So, he's got this notion of,

707
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:19,800
so he makes a distinction between phenomenal self-modeling and an ontological self. So,

708
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:24,360
people intuitively, even everyone listening to this podcast, even the way we act on a day-to-day

709
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:30,440
basis is in lieu of an ontological self. So, we can't help but really think of ourselves as being

710
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:34,600
this soul, this Cartesian soul. But anyway, Metzinga invokes this notion of phenomenal

711
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:41,080
self-modeling, how the system appears to itself. And he's got this minimal phenomenal self, which

712
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:46,440
has been unpicked in other ways, but he normally speaks generally of presentness,

713
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:51,240
minus, and perspectivalness. Exactly what I've been talking about. Yep, exactly. And he gets

714
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:56,680
fleshed out in some of the active inference work. People like Jakob Howie, Carl, and Jakob

715
01:11:56,680 --> 01:12:02,840
Limonowski have used Metzinga's work for several papers. And then, on the other end of that, we

716
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:14,040
have what Carl turned an epistemic agent model, which is the system that sees itself as epistemic

717
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:19,240
in the sense that it can retrieve past memories to inform future decisions, and agentive in the

718
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:28,280
fact that it can conduct allostatic action, i.e., action to retain some homeostatic equilibrium,

719
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:31,800
given what it knows about the future. So, me putting on a jumper before I go outside,

720
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:35,640
because I know it's going to be colder outside than it is inside. The reason why I invoke the

721
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:40,120
minimal phenomenal selfhood is because, and Carl actually outlines this in the podcast we did

722
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:48,920
together, that consciousness may be downstream, in a sense, on one, a deep temporal model,

723
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:55,880
and from that, the sense of agency. And he has an argument from referring to dimensions,

724
01:12:56,440 --> 01:13:02,680
not in terms of sort of millimeter size, but in terms of the degree to which you have embedded

725
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:09,720
markup blankets, that when we're distant from our actuators, what we end up doing is we have to have

726
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:13,880
a way of distinguishing what's my action from what's your action or from what the world is,

727
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:18,600
how the world has acted on us. And in doing that, we come up with a self other distinction, but

728
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:23,880
also the notion of an agentive self, the idea that I can change the world in accordance to my

729
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:30,760
preferences, as I mentioned beforehand. So, to paraphrase Carl, what that seems to be

730
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:37,400
suggesting is that consciousness is actually rooted in selfhood. And I know there's this whole

731
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:42,600
argument in Metzinger about whether that's the case. That's why I asked whether mindness

732
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:47,320
is also part of these pure consciousness events, or whether it's kind of a post hoc inference.

733
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:53,560
Just wondering whether you had any ideas about that notion, and whether we can truly have

734
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:59,880
consciousness without at least the sense of self. Right. Okay. So,

735
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:13,880
let me try a few things. First of all, I don't think it's inevitable that human beings model

736
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:22,040
themselves as souls. I think that's a Western post Cartesian way of, and that's even, and then the

737
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:32,280
soul as a monadic single substance, I can put it that way. That's not even the case in the ancient

738
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:39,400
world of the West, certainly not the case in other parts of the world, etc. So, I hesitate that

739
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:50,840
that's the claim that's part of how the machinery must unfold. And then secondly, I worry about

740
01:14:50,840 --> 01:15:00,600
saying that because it isn't a soul, there isn't a self. This is a weird notion, again, of a substance

741
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:07,720
ontology being just presupposed in an unquestioned manner. I mean, look, we've discovered most things

742
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:13,080
aren't substances. This table, which would be a classic Aristotelian substance, is not a substance.

743
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:19,800
It's a dynamical system of atoms and quarks, and we don't go, oh, well, because tables aren't

744
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:27,880
substances, they aren't real. Like that, we don't do that. And so, I want to just

745
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:33,320
note that I'm worried that there's a substance ontology creeping in here and leading to certain

746
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:39,480
conclusions. Now, that idea about this, I can't remember the name of the people,

747
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:47,240
and I apologize for that. There is a fairly recent theory of consciousness that trying to

748
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:52,840
respond to all the lipid experiments and things like that, arguing that, well,

749
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:59,880
consciousness is sort of after the fact, but consciousness is actually for the future. So,

750
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:07,320
the idea here is, consciousness emerges out of the evolution of episodic memory. And so,

751
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:12,200
the function of consciousness is to allow us to create an episodic memory of something we have

752
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:18,280
already done. And the point about the episodic memory is, as soon as you get into episodic

753
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:22,920
memory, you get into perspectival knowing. That's what an episode is. You have a perspective

754
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:29,880
on a situation, what you found salient and relevant, how your actions and the arena

755
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:35,320
coupled or didn't couple, the affect, all of that, all of that that's so bound up

756
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:40,920
with consciousness. And the point they make, and I totally agree with this, is as soon as you agree

757
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:45,000
that there are multiple kinds of knowing, not just propositional and procedural, but also

758
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:52,600
perspectival and participatory, you get the argument that episodic memory affords

759
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:57,640
perspectival knowing, which allows you to solve problems that you can't solve without

760
01:16:57,640 --> 01:17:03,960
perspectival knowing. You can pick up on the world, the world discloses itself in ways that it is not

761
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:12,920
otherwise disposable to you. And then consciousness emerges as an optimization on the formation of

762
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:19,960
episodic memory. So it is optimally transfer appropriate for the future. And then you get,

763
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:29,720
it is a sense of agency, but it's not a billiard ball agency. It's this kind of longitudinal agency.

764
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:35,000
And to tell you the truth, given the human critiques, that's actually the kind of agency

765
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:45,240
the cell has. It has this kind of longitudinal agency around episodes. It doesn't have this,

766
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:51,320
I'm an sort of uncaused cause, a moved mover within myself, which I think is

767
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:58,520
both a ridiculous proposal ontologically and an ethically undesired. Why would I want such a thing?

768
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:06,680
It's completely arbitrary. I think my life is being lived. I'm trying to change myself so that

769
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:12,040
I am, my thoughts are as determined by what is true, my action as determined by what is good,

770
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:17,960
and my perception is determined by what is beautiful as I possibly can. I would like to lose

771
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:24,840
all my freedom in that sense. And so I think if we move to the right level of analysis, and Gallagher

772
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:29,000
makes a convergent argument about this, that when we're talking about agency and selfhood,

773
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:34,120
we're not talking at that limit scale. We're not talking at where's the first movement of the

774
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:40,520
billiard ball chain. We're talking more about, no, no, no, how are we building this long-term

775
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:48,200
virtual engine that enhances our predictive agency in the world? Yeah, absolutely. And Gallagher's

776
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:55,640
work is very convergent with Thomas Metzinger's, of course. And so this, just for our audience,

777
01:18:55,640 --> 01:19:02,360
this, these arguments, and this notion of the narrativized self is well fleshed out in active

778
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:07,320
inference literature. So I could point you, yeah, I would probably start with the Fristlin and

779
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:12,440
Limonalski papers. There are two wonderful papers about self-construction under active inference.

780
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:17,640
And then I have a convergent argument coming out of Daniel Huda, who is also in the 4U,

781
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:24,280
the Narrative Practice Hypothesis. And he argues that any mindsight ability, any ability to see

782
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:29,880
in other people's mental states, you know, attributing beliefs and desires to them,

783
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:36,280
requires, well, for example, if I'm going to attribute a belief and desire, I need to know

784
01:19:36,280 --> 01:19:41,800
something about your character. Are you lying or not? I need to know something about the context,

785
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:46,280
the setting. What's going on in this situation? Are you tired? Is that a small child? So you're

786
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:49,560
not really lying. And when you tell them at Christmas time that there's a Santa Claus,

787
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:54,920
right? Right. And I need to know what the conflict is, what the problem. Notice what I'm

788
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:59,560
talking about here. I need to know all the elements of narrative. Daniel Huda points out,

789
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:04,920
we practice narrative incessantly. And unlike many of the other things, including language,

790
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:10,680
which we scaffold for children, we scaffold narrative for our kids. I had to sit through the

791
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:16,280
teletubbies twice, in which you have to sit through these really impoverished narratives,

792
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:23,800
because we're scaffolding this up because narrative ability gives us the right, gives us the set of

793
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:28,920
skills, the sets of states of mind with the perspectives taking therein, and the traits

794
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:34,280
of character that allow us to pick up on other people's mental states. And I think that is also

795
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:40,200
a function of the self, the function of selves is to make us agentically predictive to each other.

796
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:44,840
Right. Exactly. Exactly. And there's another, there's another convergent argument in active

797
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:51,480
inference, which is that only in the context of other people like you, would you ever come to

798
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:57,240
the inference that there is something that is like to be you? Yeah. If you were low,

799
01:20:58,360 --> 01:21:02,760
that converges with the Vagatsky approach to the development of metacognition and self-awareness,

800
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:08,760
which I think is right. Right. And of course, your colleague at just pointing people in

801
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:12,040
different directions, your colleague at Toronto, former colleague Jordan Peterson,

802
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:20,280
as a whole literature on literature and narrative. And he has a conversation with Carl

803
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:26,600
on his podcast, which is deeply intriguing about these kind of alignments of the free energy

804
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:36,520
principle and narrative. John, I wanted to also speak about flow states. You've written about flow

805
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:42,520
as the sort of locus of implicit learning. As you know, I've just been writing up a paper on flow

806
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:48,760
for an active inference perspective. So I'd love to be able to sort of see maybe where we align,

807
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:54,200
where we don't align and try and sort of unpick that. Just as forewarning my paper, the paper that

808
01:21:54,200 --> 01:22:00,440
I've written with my wonderful co-authors is not out yet, but it should be coming out soon. So

809
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:05,400
I want to, I have not yet read your paper because you suggest waiting.

810
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:11,560
Yes. The paper has gone through modifications as papers are want to do.

811
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:17,880
It's in the final stages. So you have access to it. So please feel free to read it.

812
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:24,680
I will read it then. I will read it. I can give a very brief overview. So to not disadvantage you.

813
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:31,160
My, the basic thesis of the basic perspective that we take on the paper is about self-modeling

814
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:35,400
under flow states. So that's the main thing that we're looking at and the attenuation of an epistemic

815
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:42,840
agent model. Because what we're arguing is that certain precision waiting mechanisms are lending,

816
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:50,600
leading the organism to undertake pragmatic actions, seeking out pragmatic affordances,

817
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:55,560
rather than engaging in what Carl or other authors would call epistemic foraging.

818
01:22:56,680 --> 01:23:00,360
Now, I think where we might have a point of difference here is that I have a section on flow

819
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:05,480
states and learning. And I think this is a really interesting point because your paper speaks about

820
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:12,600
implicit learning. Whereas I'm, and this, and just to make it transparent, this is there,

821
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:18,760
I've had different perspectives on this, but my current opinion is that in flow states,

822
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:25,080
what you're getting is a reinforcement of the skills that you actually picked up through epistemic

823
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:34,760
work. So I have the example of a violinist. The violinist must undergo a certain period of exploration,

824
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:40,280
of epistemic foraging, which comes with this kind of self-talk, this real prominence of

825
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:46,920
myself as a knowing thing. And then what it does is over time through learning, you get high

826
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:52,280
precision over the beliefs about that action in terms of the technical detail. And then that

827
01:23:52,280 --> 01:23:57,000
becomes kind of the foundation on which you can then go and do more epistemic work. And then that

828
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:05,000
expertise development is stepwise, in a sense. I mean, you can picture it either way. But critically,

829
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:09,640
where we differ is that I'm arguing that actually in the moment of flow itself,

830
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:15,000
you're just garnering more evidence for the capacities and the policies that you already have.

831
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:20,360
So I'd like to start there and see what you think of that claim.

832
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:30,120
So we, as you point out, Leo Ferraro in Herobenidae, we argue something different,

833
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:38,520
which is why you're bringing it up. We argue that learning is inevitably occurring even in

834
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:44,440
the flow situation. And so there's improvement. And that's why if the environment doesn't have

835
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:49,960
the capacity to renew its challenges on you, you will very quickly fall out of the flow state.

836
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:54,200
So the argument is, well, why don't you just stay in the flow state? Well, the argument is,

837
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:59,800
because eventually you get a mastery over the environment, which means your skills start to

838
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:06,600
exceed the demands. And so phenomenologically, when I'm in the flow state, like inspiring or

839
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:12,760
lecturing, I'm finding tremendous amount of insight and innovation coming out.

840
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:22,520
Now, this is where it might get tricky, because is procedural innovation a restructuring of,

841
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:29,480
especially, is that a restructuring of your information and therefore have new capacities

842
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:35,720
in it, new emergent abilities? Or is it just a reinforcement? And I don't, we might get into

843
01:25:35,720 --> 01:25:45,400
the thesis of ship here, which is problematic. But the one of the defining phenomenological

844
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:52,440
features of the flow state, and I want to be clear, I'm not pinning you down on this,

845
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:57,960
but I do think it's relevant evidence is the ongoing sense of discovery. There's a sense of

846
01:25:57,960 --> 01:26:03,560
discovery there. There's a sense of coming to know things you did not know before. And of course,

847
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:08,360
when the flow state is in much more comprehensive expertise, not like the plain tennis or maybe

848
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:12,760
like just your optimal gripping on the world, people come to think they have learned something

849
01:26:12,760 --> 01:26:21,400
deeply profound about reality. So I tend to think that there's evidence for transformative learning

850
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:27,640
happening up and beyond just reinforcement learning. Okay. Yeah, I like the return to the

851
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:32,040
phenomena. You know, Dreyfus has this phrase, which I will definitely use over and over again

852
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:38,360
in this podcast, which is when in doubt return to the phenomena. The way that we have cast it

853
01:26:38,920 --> 01:26:43,960
is that there's this idea in the literature about a hyper prior that the world is changing. So that

854
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:50,120
we have a prior that the world is changing. And that is adapted for us because we don't get stuck

855
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:55,720
in the same free energy minima. Now, if that prior is always at play, what ends up happening

856
01:26:55,720 --> 01:27:02,200
downstream on that is that my inference about my own abilities deteriorates over time. And we

857
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:06,520
experience that, I guess, I mean, like if I play tennis today, and then I play tennis in a week's

858
01:27:06,520 --> 01:27:10,600
time, I'm probably going to have less fidelity in my own capacities in the week's time. And I do,

859
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:18,280
if I play tomorrow, having followed today. And so our argument is that the positive affect

860
01:27:18,280 --> 01:27:23,880
that's part of the flow state is downstream on the surprise that's generated when you actually

861
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:28,280
violate that hyper prior that the world is changing. Because what you're getting evidence for is that

862
01:27:28,280 --> 01:27:31,720
your policy still work in the world that you would have been for, you would have thought

863
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:38,120
didn't lend itself to your policies working. And there's this idea, Casper Hesp's paper and his

864
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:44,760
co-authors in 2021 that affect inactive inference is about basically your model doing better than

865
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:50,520
you thought it would do. And this actually comes a lot into what Mark talks about in terms of

866
01:27:50,520 --> 01:28:03,800
aerodynamics. So I'm wondering, I don't know. Well, see, I think that's right. And the problem,

867
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:08,840
of course, is you can get an infinite regress. So well, I'll say, well, the things here, and you'll

868
01:28:08,840 --> 01:28:13,720
say, well, there needs to be something a hyper prior behind that. And then we can, that's what I

869
01:28:13,720 --> 01:28:19,480
mean about thesis is shit. So again, I would say, well, what are you getting better at? And what

870
01:28:19,480 --> 01:28:27,320
you're getting better at, I would argue, is not stand like so expertise is generally built around

871
01:28:28,680 --> 01:28:35,320
giving you a well, like a specific domain. We can talk about the possibility of sort of meta

872
01:28:35,320 --> 01:28:41,480
expertise if you want. But what I mean by that is, once you've got expertise, you've gotten really

873
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:47,960
good at within a certain domain at formulating the problems you're fronting as for you, well

874
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:53,720
defined problems. That's one way in which an expert is sort of reliably different from a novice.

875
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:57,400
A novice goes in, this is no defined problem, the expert goes, it goes in, it's a, no, it's this

876
01:28:57,400 --> 01:29:02,200
problem. And this is the right way to do this and this and this and this. Okay, so we agree with

877
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:07,400
that. But I think what's happening, right? And maybe this is the gray area between your position

878
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:11,320
in mind. I think what's happening is we're discovering new ways in which we can turn

879
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:16,280
well defined problem, sorry, ill defined states into well defined problems. But something's like,

880
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:26,840
I didn't realize I could adapt to that situation, but I can. And that sounds similar. But for me,

881
01:29:26,840 --> 01:29:33,800
that's an insight experience. And that's what, like it's an insight flow, because you're getting

882
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:39,560
an extension of your cognitive capacity, because you have restructured what you take to be

883
01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:44,280
like your, your problem formulation of the world. That's, that's,

884
01:29:45,640 --> 01:29:53,240
yeah, I mean, to supplement that, I actually, I don't disagree on that note, but the way I would

885
01:29:53,240 --> 01:29:56,840
formulate that, and this actually isn't in the paper. It's in the paper in some sense,

886
01:29:56,840 --> 01:29:59,800
but it's not a fully fleshed out argument, because it wasn't hyper relevant.

887
01:30:00,440 --> 01:30:05,160
I'm glad there's another really quality paper on flow. There's really nothing.

888
01:30:05,720 --> 01:30:10,840
When we published the paper, we were literally the only paper talking about the cognitive

889
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:17,960
processes that work in flow. It's a bizarre one. There's very little on skillful coping,

890
01:30:17,960 --> 01:30:22,840
generally, within cognitive science. But as I said, I think that's why I said there should be

891
01:30:22,840 --> 01:30:30,920
more phenomenology active or cognitive science convergence. What we kind of mentioned in brief

892
01:30:30,920 --> 01:30:35,960
is that flow, if we take the sort of macro perspective on what flow is, it can also be

893
01:30:35,960 --> 01:30:41,240
this kind of humming between the pragmatic and the epistemic boundary. So maybe when you're

894
01:30:41,240 --> 01:30:50,200
realizing, oh, I can reframe this kind of perplexing problem and actually something manageable,

895
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:55,400
what you're doing there is maybe just slightly x-ting the flow, doing some epistemic foraging,

896
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:58,520
returning, because something I want to make really clear to everyone listening as well.

897
01:30:59,240 --> 01:31:04,360
When we talk about epistemic action and pragmatic action in terms of expected free energy or active

898
01:31:04,360 --> 01:31:11,160
inference, it's not like the agent goes, I'm doing pragmatic action right now. It's part

899
01:31:11,160 --> 01:31:19,160
of the actual maths. If you look at the maths, firstly, you can do a bit of both at the same

900
01:31:19,160 --> 01:31:24,440
time. That's a thing. But it's also like the action policies that we're talking about here,

901
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:31,560
John and I, these are not protracted seven hours of just like pragmatic action. No,

902
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:35,720
these have to be very temporally thin because the world is volatile. The world is constantly

903
01:31:35,720 --> 01:31:40,600
changing. And so you have to be able to not just pin all your hopes or pull your eggs in one basket

904
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:45,880
in terms of an action policy. And so actually fundamentally, our divergence might well be

905
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:51,080
a semantic thing, which is that I'm talking very much about the synchronic nature of being in flow

906
01:31:51,080 --> 01:31:57,400
right now. And for simplicity, I have that boundary between pragmatic and epistemic,

907
01:31:57,400 --> 01:32:03,960
whereas if you take a more macro perspective, as that flow state, as the concerto unfolds,

908
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:06,360
you could be humming at that boundary and doing learning as well.

909
01:32:07,240 --> 01:32:12,280
Yeah, I really look forward to your paper because I think that sounds like actually

910
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:18,840
a powerful way in which the theories could be integrated together. I'm also interested in

911
01:32:18,840 --> 01:32:23,240
the question that's emerging out of this, well, I've already been interested in the question,

912
01:32:23,240 --> 01:32:27,880
but it emerges out of what we're talking about. Because I'm interested because I think there's,

913
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:36,680
there might be an additional thing. Because there's, you can flow in a situation and it

914
01:32:36,680 --> 01:32:41,240
doesn't transfer, it doesn't transfer to other domains, video game addiction is the classic

915
01:32:41,240 --> 01:32:45,080
model, you can flow in the game, you can't flow in the world. So you get depressed in the world,

916
01:32:45,080 --> 01:32:48,120
you can flow in the game and so you want to stay in the game more and more and more.

917
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:54,280
That's very different than how I flow in Tai Chi Chuan. Tai Chi Chuan, in fact,

918
01:32:54,280 --> 01:32:58,680
other people pointed this out in me, the flow states that I cultivate in Tai Chi Chuan,

919
01:32:58,680 --> 01:33:03,480
I can, they are cultivated in such a way that they transfer broadly and deeply to many other

920
01:33:03,480 --> 01:33:10,920
domains. And I'm interested in this sort of ritual framework, because what you get is this

921
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:17,240
ritual and this philosophical framework, Taoism and other, other practices and ecology of practices

922
01:33:17,240 --> 01:33:26,840
around so that it broadens, like it transfers in powerful ways. And I'm wondering what the

923
01:33:26,840 --> 01:33:32,680
differences are. And also if, how does that show up? Is there a phenomenological difference?

924
01:33:33,640 --> 01:33:40,600
I mean, so now really, really, really weakly, anecdotally, right, in terms of phenomenological

925
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:46,680
practice, I do get a sense of a difference between what I'm just flowing and what I'm flowing in a

926
01:33:46,680 --> 01:33:53,000
ritual context. So if I enter into a violin hall, and let's say I'm an expert in playing the violin,

927
01:33:53,560 --> 01:33:58,600
and I see a crowd and I see my violin and I see the whole stage, what I end up getting is this,

928
01:33:59,320 --> 01:34:05,640
so habits are quite well codified within active inference, you get this kind of contextual cue

929
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:09,080
that like in layman's touch, although this isn't, we're saying this isn't happening propositionally,

930
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:15,400
it's time for me to play the violin. And this can look like precision over beliefs about your own

931
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:21,160
action. So what, this is again, not something I've thought about necessarily with any depth,

932
01:34:21,160 --> 01:34:24,840
because this is just something that you've brought up. I'm wondering whether that contextual cue,

933
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:27,800
what you're happening when you're doing Tai Chi and then maybe what you're doing when you're

934
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:38,840
lecturing is that your system is seeing similarities in the context and doing similar precision

935
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:45,560
weighting in a separate domain. Yeah, I think that's right. And I think what philosophical

936
01:34:45,560 --> 01:34:54,360
frameworks do is they reverse engineer that. They try to find out what might be similar,

937
01:34:54,440 --> 01:35:00,520
or maybe even invariant across many contexts, and then build that back into the specific context

938
01:35:00,520 --> 01:35:06,680
in which you are doing the practice to exactly afford that transfer appropriate processing.

939
01:35:06,680 --> 01:35:11,240
I think that's right. I think there's something else also going on with the cueing, and this goes

940
01:35:11,240 --> 01:35:18,600
into Aptur's metamotivational theory. We can be broadly speaking, we frame our arousal in two

941
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:25,000
different ways. When we're in italic mode and we're working towards, where the reward is found

942
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:31,160
in the external goal, then increased effort is experienced as frustration and then it increases

943
01:35:31,160 --> 01:35:36,120
too much of getting anxiety. But if I'm doing something where the goal is the behavior itself,

944
01:35:36,120 --> 01:35:40,920
like making love or doing poetry, then the increased, not infinitely obviously, but the

945
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:48,840
increased arousal is framed as positive, as excitement. And so I think also, and so Aptur

946
01:35:48,840 --> 01:35:57,240
talks about safety framing. Let's call the first italic mode work and the peritolic mode

947
01:35:59,560 --> 01:36:04,360
a play. I think ritual has to do with serious play, and I've got a whole argument about that.

948
01:36:04,360 --> 01:36:09,400
But I think also what you're doing in the context is you're trying to cue people into the play mode

949
01:36:10,120 --> 01:36:17,160
because the play mode allows them to model themselves, their arousal, as positive,

950
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:22,600
rather than as negative. And that allows them, and I think there's a deep connection between

951
01:36:22,600 --> 01:36:28,760
this peritolic framing and Csikszentmihais, I think accurate claim that flow is autotelic,

952
01:36:28,760 --> 01:36:34,520
doing it for its own sake. Right. Yeah, cool. Yeah, I like the notion of effort here.

953
01:36:35,480 --> 01:36:39,560
Recognize that one of the fundamental factors or fundamental characteristics of flow is

954
01:36:40,360 --> 01:36:45,560
perceived effortlessness. Yes, even though you can, even though you can have sort of very

955
01:36:46,280 --> 01:36:52,760
peripheral cues that you might be expending a lot of metabolic energy. Exactly. And just for the,

956
01:36:53,320 --> 01:36:57,800
given this is the Active Inference Institute's podcast, just for those interested in the

957
01:36:57,800 --> 01:37:02,760
computational framing of that within Active Inference, Thomas Parr has got a paper out this

958
01:37:02,760 --> 01:37:08,200
year on cognitive effort and Active Inference. So that gives a kind of nice computational

959
01:37:08,200 --> 01:37:13,160
modeling picture of that, which actually leads me to a much broader question because I know we're,

960
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:19,240
we haven't got too much more time, which is I've noticed in myself to be totally candid that I've

961
01:37:19,240 --> 01:37:25,960
started, like I learned about flow and Csikszentmihais through you and through other people,

962
01:37:25,960 --> 01:37:32,440
but mainly as a philosophical notion. And now I'm viewing it as a computational notion.

963
01:37:32,440 --> 01:37:39,800
Yes. Do you worry about that? Do you worry that if we rely too much on computation, not just

964
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:46,840
computational models, but maths, physics, we in some ways reduce the phenomena in a way that's

965
01:37:46,840 --> 01:37:52,440
detrimental, not just because it's not romantic or that it's, but like that we're missing something

966
01:37:52,440 --> 01:37:58,280
fundamentally? Well, it depends. I mean, that's a really important question. We could do two hours

967
01:37:58,280 --> 01:38:05,320
on just that question. But if you think that a leveled ontology is actually the way ontology is,

968
01:38:06,760 --> 01:38:11,080
that the level at which we do science is as ontologically real as the quantum level we

969
01:38:11,080 --> 01:38:14,520
discover when we're doing science. And I think you have to come to that conclusion.

970
01:38:14,520 --> 01:38:20,520
Right. And I have extended arguments for that elsewhere. Then you can make a clean philosophical

971
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:25,080
distinction between explaining a way in a reductive fashion and explaining that actually

972
01:38:25,080 --> 01:38:31,160
enriches your appreciation for the phenomena. Now, if the computational stuff, the computational

973
01:38:31,160 --> 01:38:35,800
stuff to my mind, well, let's say what the argument we were just exploring has merit,

974
01:38:36,440 --> 01:38:39,960
then notice what we were saying. We're saying, well, what the computational modeling actually does

975
01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:45,800
is actually shows why this sometimes very obscure philosophical framework is really important.

976
01:38:45,800 --> 01:38:51,800
It's actually doing some really important work. And you can't get rid of it. You can't dispense with

977
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:59,400
it. And that would mean that some of the stuff we're doing, where we're trying to commodify flow

978
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:05,560
and take it out of those frameworks and do the thing we do and sell books.

979
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:14,280
It's actually misrepresenting the phenomena in a way that we can philosophically and scientifically

980
01:39:14,280 --> 01:39:19,880
critique. It's like, wait, wait, this phenomena has the power it has, because Chick-Mat St.

981
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:25,960
said it's an evolutionary market for adaptivity. And then, well, making it adaptive is how broadly

982
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:30,600
and deeply is it transferring out of the situation. And then the philosophical framework really

983
01:39:30,600 --> 01:39:36,840
matters to what it is and how it functions. And so if you can make a distinction and you need

984
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:40,200
an ontological distinction to make this distinction, but if you can make a distinction

985
01:39:40,200 --> 01:39:46,680
between explaining and explaining a way, then I think it's possible to say, no, no,

986
01:39:46,680 --> 01:39:52,600
when I do these things. And to be fair to me, there's, I got a lot of people who, you know,

987
01:39:52,600 --> 01:39:56,760
from various religious and spiritual backgrounds, and they come in and they say, thank you so much

988
01:39:56,760 --> 01:40:03,480
for your work. I now, I much better appreciate this, this experience or that experience or the

989
01:40:03,480 --> 01:40:09,480
flow state or this mystical state, because you didn't try and tell me it's nothing. But you

990
01:40:09,480 --> 01:40:14,280
tried to say, this is what it's doing. And this is why you like it and value it so much.

991
01:40:14,280 --> 01:40:20,440
But do you think your work, to kind of, yeah, to look at that personal vantage point, do you

992
01:40:20,440 --> 01:40:28,520
think you've managed to keep, like, because if I, without being sort of embarrassingly lording,

993
01:40:29,560 --> 01:40:35,480
people should watch Awakening from the Meaning Crisis, not only for the content, but also just

994
01:40:35,480 --> 01:40:41,480
the way you present it, which is just so magical. So thanks. I mean, it's really inspired a lot of

995
01:40:41,480 --> 01:40:47,640
the way that I think science should be done and philosophy should be done. What, what is it about,

996
01:40:47,640 --> 01:40:52,280
I think, you know, anyone who watches that recognizes there's something kind of special

997
01:40:52,280 --> 01:40:56,920
going on there. The ideas are living through you, you're, they're breathing through you,

998
01:40:56,920 --> 01:41:00,680
you're breathing through them, there's this really beautiful coupling. Again, we'll come back to that

999
01:41:00,680 --> 01:41:09,960
between you and the ideas. What, what is it about that kind of synthesis of the philosophy and the

1000
01:41:10,040 --> 01:41:16,600
sort of more hard cognitive science? Do you think made that project so successful?

1001
01:41:18,920 --> 01:41:23,960
I suppose it's a view of the role of cognitive science, what cognitive science is doing.

1002
01:41:27,240 --> 01:41:30,840
I think what cognitive science does is it's,

1003
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:39,480
well, I'll try and do it sort of narratively. And I do this in the series. I think, you know,

1004
01:41:40,680 --> 01:41:44,280
even the notion of mind that we've been invoking mind and cognition is equivocal,

1005
01:41:45,080 --> 01:41:52,120
because it means one thing to the neuroscientists who study the brain and looking at neurons and

1006
01:41:52,120 --> 01:41:55,720
anatomical networks and perhaps functional networks. It means a different thing to the

1007
01:41:55,720 --> 01:42:01,400
artificial intelligence person who's building algorithms and heuristics and doing reinforcement

1008
01:42:01,400 --> 01:42:05,480
learning and blah, blah. It means a different thing to the psychologists who study human behavior

1009
01:42:05,480 --> 01:42:09,720
with experiments and running stats. And they talk about working memory. They don't talk so much

1010
01:42:10,120 --> 01:42:13,000
right. And it means a different thing to the linguists and a different thing to the cultural

1011
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:16,520
anthropologists. By the way, I include them because they were the people that have been

1012
01:42:16,520 --> 01:42:21,560
studying distributed cognition and collective intelligence. They matter. Yeah. If you think

1013
01:42:21,560 --> 01:42:25,480
about it on this analogy, it's like they're different countries speaking different languages.

1014
01:42:25,480 --> 01:42:31,880
And here's the thing that has great value. Specialization has great value. I'm not dismissing

1015
01:42:31,880 --> 01:42:37,880
that. I am not dismissing that. But each one of these is talking about a different level. And

1016
01:42:37,880 --> 01:42:43,640
here's what I think I would state as a very plausible claim. I think it's unlikely that these

1017
01:42:43,640 --> 01:42:49,800
levels in reality, the brain information processing, behavioral, linguistic, sociocultural levels

1018
01:42:49,800 --> 01:42:54,680
are independent from each other. I think they causal influence and constrain each other.

1019
01:42:54,680 --> 01:43:01,800
So we are missing something important about the mind by not getting clear about the relationship

1020
01:43:01,800 --> 01:43:07,480
between these levels. We can be equivocating and we have a fragmented notion if we don't capture

1021
01:43:07,880 --> 01:43:13,480
the relations of constraint and causation between these different levels of cognition and mind.

1022
01:43:14,040 --> 01:43:21,160
And so I think the proper function of cognitive science is to use philosophy's skills of

1023
01:43:22,360 --> 01:43:29,240
creating bridging discourses, creating bridging conceptual vocabulary, theoretical grammar,

1024
01:43:29,240 --> 01:43:35,480
so that these different disciplines can talk to each other in reciprocally reconstructive ways

1025
01:43:35,560 --> 01:43:41,640
as a way of converging on the causal and constraint relationships between the levels,

1026
01:43:41,640 --> 01:43:48,200
rather than trying to compete or say the bottom level is the only real level. So that for me,

1027
01:43:48,200 --> 01:43:53,320
they all live together. They are doing, and I'm sorry to evoke it again, they're doing

1028
01:43:53,320 --> 01:44:02,680
opponent processing between each other. And that's what inhabits me when I'm doing cognitive

1029
01:44:02,680 --> 01:44:07,320
science, that vision. I call it synoptic integration. Yeah, it's, well, it's wonderful to see.

1030
01:44:09,080 --> 01:44:15,240
So, I mean, like, I think we, I mean, that's the cognitive scientists that I'm aspiring to be.

1031
01:44:15,240 --> 01:44:19,320
I think you've called it a big picture cognitive scientist as well. Yes. And one of the things,

1032
01:44:19,320 --> 01:44:23,880
one of the, and I felt very lonely for a while, you know, I was doing relevance realization,

1033
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:30,040
which is a big picture. And then, to my great delight, another big picture for ecocide down

1034
01:44:30,040 --> 01:44:35,720
the road. And then to my even greater happiness, another big picture came down the road,

1035
01:44:35,720 --> 01:44:41,560
which is, you know, the predictive processing framework. And I think they are more convergent

1036
01:44:41,560 --> 01:44:47,800
than adversarial. And I, well, you've heard me arguing about how we can integrate them together.

1037
01:44:47,800 --> 01:44:53,800
Excellent. Yeah, I would say maybe it's just bias. Active inferences or physics processing is a

1038
01:44:53,800 --> 01:45:00,200
big picture cognitive scientist from the physics and the maths, all the way, well, what we're

1039
01:45:00,200 --> 01:45:06,120
trying to do to the phenomena, to what it is like to be a, to be a human being, to have conversations

1040
01:45:06,120 --> 01:45:11,880
like this. John, it's, it was, you know, I can't say it was better than I expected,

1041
01:45:11,880 --> 01:45:17,560
because I knew it was going to be wonderful, but you're full of just thrilling insights and

1042
01:45:18,200 --> 01:45:21,640
speaking to you, listening to you is always such a wonderful learning experience.

1043
01:45:21,640 --> 01:45:29,400
Where that happens in flow or without flow. But I just wanted to thank you so very much for,

1044
01:45:29,400 --> 01:45:35,560
I know you're extremely busy, but for giving us your time. Where can people find you? What have

1045
01:45:35,560 --> 01:45:41,880
you got coming up? I'm sure people are curious. So the most immediate thing for this conversation

1046
01:45:42,760 --> 01:45:48,200
is the talk I gave at Leiden on the predictive processing symposium. It's up on my channel.

1047
01:45:48,280 --> 01:45:51,720
I think it's the second most recent video on my channel on YouTube.

1048
01:45:51,720 --> 01:45:56,840
We can put it in the video. Yeah. Where I try to go into the nuts and bolts of how you could

1049
01:45:56,840 --> 01:46:02,280
integrate predictive processing and relevance realisation theory together. So people might find

1050
01:46:02,280 --> 01:46:08,040
that. And I've got a lot of good feedback on that for being sort of clear and a good argument.

1051
01:46:08,920 --> 01:46:16,040
So I would recommend that when people are interested in the broader implications of this

1052
01:46:16,120 --> 01:46:23,240
awakening for the meeting crisis and then after Socrates also after Socrates is where I take all

1053
01:46:23,240 --> 01:46:27,720
of this and all of this stuff and how do you turn it into practices in order to overcome

1054
01:46:27,720 --> 01:46:33,640
self deception and enhance relevance realisation become more wise and virtuous. And so they can

1055
01:46:33,640 --> 01:46:41,560
take a look there. The arguments around neoplatonism. There are several videos around that. I try to

1056
01:46:41,640 --> 01:46:47,320
connect neoplatonism to foreecogsci and relevance realisation and predictive processing as we

1057
01:46:47,320 --> 01:46:53,240
saw in this podcast. But in the neoplatonism I'm working on my third big series. Walking the

1058
01:46:53,240 --> 01:46:58,680
philosophical Silk Road which will be on Zen neoplatonism. Trying to see if we can bring

1059
01:46:58,680 --> 01:47:03,400
an integration, an opponent processing, not an adversarial one, an opponent processing between

1060
01:47:03,960 --> 01:47:10,520
Zen and neoplatonism to give us a rich philosophical framework by which like the philosophical road

1061
01:47:10,520 --> 01:47:19,080
we can trade ideas and move between worlds without having to descend into well tribalism

1062
01:47:19,080 --> 01:47:24,920
and other such things. Wonderful, wonderful. Well, again, it was absolutely my pleasure.

1063
01:47:24,920 --> 01:47:28,600
I apologise. I've got a slight cold. So if I've been a little sniffly or nasal,

1064
01:47:31,400 --> 01:47:36,360
we can blame it on the London weather. But I'd love to have you back on. At some point

1065
01:47:37,240 --> 01:47:42,440
your work is truly inspiring. So thank you so much, John, for me and the Institute.

1066
01:47:43,400 --> 01:47:50,520
Thank you, Doris. I'm happy to come back on. If it turns out that Mark and I come on together,

1067
01:47:50,520 --> 01:47:54,120
that would be thrilling as well. Great. We will definitely get that sorted. All right, thank you.

1068
01:47:55,320 --> 01:47:59,320
Thank you.
