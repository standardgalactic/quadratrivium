00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,640
Hello and welcome. It is September 12, 2023. We're here in the Active Inference for the

2
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:20,480
Social Sciences course at the Active Inference Institute and having a discussion section

3
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:28,560
on semiotics and semantics here with Lorena Saganzula. We're going to be having a fun discussion,

4
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,920
I hope. If you're watching live, please feel free to write any questions in the live chat.

5
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,240
If you thought about joining and you weren't sure, it's not too late. Otherwise, we're going to

6
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:48,480
pick up on some key points from the lecture and on the topic and see where we go. So, Lorena,

7
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,680
welcome back and however you want to begin, let's go from there.

8
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:09,600
Okay. Hello. Thank you, Daniel. So, let's try to recap a little bit where we left off during the

9
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:22,000
lecture just to remind us where we were. My point, what I was trying to articulate was the idea of

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,960
what does it mean to talk about formal semantics in a way that is not really

11
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:40,640
loaded because it's an interesting thought to have a semantics that is actually only formal.

12
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:51,920
In principle, it would be relative to meaning. In the notion that

13
00:01:52,880 --> 00:02:08,320
active inference is trying to cash it out. It's more like an idea or a way of modeling how

14
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:19,760
how we deal with meaningful situations. And she understands that in a more interesting,

15
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:27,680
more embodied and more concrete way, I was suggesting that we could use bio-semiotics as

16
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:46,000
as a model and as a theory for leaving creatures like language users to navigate the realm of symbols.

17
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:59,360
And gave one example which came from James Koch, which is the European forest

18
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:05,520
trade that comes with a practice. Understanding this scientific understanding of forests as a

19
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:18,000
practice that allows us to refer to meaningful things in the environment in terms of what is

20
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:28,800
valuable, what's interesting and what is not. And interestingly, what is more important also

21
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:39,760
from what becomes valuable, it is what is cropped out from the meaningful perspective. So things

22
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:48,240
nature, parts of nature becomes left out or understood as something that is not desirable.

23
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:57,520
And you just understand what you don't want in your articulating principle as weeds or

24
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:06,880
something that you should get rid of in respect to what is more desirable in terms of crops and

25
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:13,440
how you understand nature in a more commoditized way.

26
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:26,160
And I find like this example from Scott kind of very, very elucidating.

27
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:36,640
In the book he creates this, in the book he's talking about states, how we articulate

28
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:44,080
life around one specific notion of state. But in this specific example he has

29
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:51,280
the idea of one official observer and this official observer establishes a principle of

30
00:04:52,160 --> 00:05:00,880
meaning in a way you have to have a handle of nature and that also articulates how

31
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:11,120
villages and how practices around agriculture and how people relate to each other within these

32
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:24,560
practices gets organized. Specifically for one interesting point that he makes that is to appreciate

33
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:31,920
to appreciate the constriction of that is like a vision that notices not

34
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:37,920
what within the meaningful crops but which is left outside the field of vision.

35
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,440
And I bring that specifically to understand how

36
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:55,440
the free-knit principle can or could be connected to a generalized synchronization

37
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:03,200
over time in relation to those symbols and those practices in terms of niche construction and

38
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:12,880
how those, how this niche construction brings along with the symbolic

39
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,640
use of our language, our predictive value.

40
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:31,200
Thank you. Bryn, do you want to bring up any thoughts on that or any other

41
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,320
pieces or I'm happy to add a comment.

42
00:06:42,960 --> 00:07:02,560
Okay, guess not. A lot to say there. There was a little bit of a double play with what is cropped.

43
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:14,560
On one hand what is cropped is the industrial crop that is being prepared and then the other

44
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:20,640
side of that coin is what is cropped out and what we crop in is the part that we're paying

45
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:27,440
attention to and we can't pay attention to everything so it's like two sides of the same coin

46
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:33,120
what we pay attention to what we include in attention in our cognitive awareness

47
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:42,240
leaves the shadow which is what we exclude and that could be like the weeds or the other ecosystem

48
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:49,200
services so by highlighting the meaning or one dimension of meaning or one stance on meaning

49
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:56,880
that only it's like a seesaw that becomes salient to the extent that something else

50
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:03,760
must be deprioritized so that's how we accentuate these distributions of meaning

51
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:10,800
and what do we get from active inference and and free energy principle beyond for example

52
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,400
what's provided and seeing like a state. I think there's a lot we could say on that but

53
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:26,560
one piece is we get a process theory a real procedural approach to how different systems

54
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:34,160
come to do sense making and cognition and action so just describing the lay of the land

55
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:42,880
or the history of forestry in Europe or any other state of affairs in the world

56
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,080
merely describing it may not even help us determine what's going to happen

57
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:55,120
a short time later let alone a long time later or what might happen in a very different ecology

58
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:01,520
whereas if we understand the processes of sense making and decision making that different kinds

59
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:07,840
of cognitive agents do certainly humans also those states as cognitive entities which is

60
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:13,840
what seeing like a state or thinking like a state entails we get a process-based view

61
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:21,520
on what otherwise might be merely descriptive and along with that process-based view we gain

62
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:27,680
an increased ability to make unique explanations predictions accounts and so on.

63
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:41,680
Yeah we can we can also understand it in a different perspective in terms of

64
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:48,800
realizing what becomes sensitized and what becomes desensitized

65
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:56,880
along the process so you can you can possibly model that using this kind of tools and understanding

66
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:02,720
how that happens over time right I don't know how how much in terms of prediction

67
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:10,080
of things that we're not foreseeing in these descriptions we can we can achieve in fact

68
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:17,840
you can achieve some some level for sure but like that system should be this side how

69
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:25,120
how that delivers a very all-encompassing prediction in this kind in these cases they

70
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:35,920
don't believe it can right I don't think that's the purpose as well but we can at least have

71
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:43,360
which is might not be as positive as we want but I think we can understand how

72
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:51,200
we can gain some understanding in this process of being more sensitive or less sensitive to specific

73
00:10:51,680 --> 00:11:02,160
primes and how this organizational principles how powerful they become over time

74
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:12,320
yeah I'll read some comments in the chat and then Lorena or Brent feel free to just give

75
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:20,640
any thoughts just upcycle club wrote hello biomimicry can enhance biosemiotics by showing

76
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:27,200
us how nature solves problems and creates beauty through signs and codes and by encouraging us

77
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:38,000
to apply these principles to our own creations yeah the idea of coding is an interesting idea

78
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:45,440
but to talk about codes I don't think we can that's my take right I don't understand

79
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:55,120
like you have we haven't coded any type of principles within our cognitive ability but

80
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:04,960
biologically speaking however you can understand these encodings in terms of becoming more or less

81
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:14,560
sensitive over time to environmental cues as the example in terms of I use the example of

82
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:26,240
forestry right so in that specific case this what becomes more what you become more sensitive and

83
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:32,080
the more you organize your life or the social life is organized around specific principles

84
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:42,000
then you can make sense of these relational stories instead of just leveraging one full

85
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:52,960
difficult to explain notion of encoding in terms of social cognition because it will be hard to

86
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:59,920
explain how the brain will be encoding these specific symbols but they can be cashed out

87
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,800
in the environment relationally in terms of those organizational principles

88
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:14,800
and then you have this idea of biomimicry like this reiterations and how that comes along with

89
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,600
to explain what this mimic or this mean will be then

90
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,440
of it's not so so straightforward they think

91
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:35,520
well certainly decompiling the source code of nature is somewhere between challenging and

92
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:43,680
misguided or impossible but that notion of a code script for biology has animated discussions of

93
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:49,440
life going back to for example Schrodinger's what is life he basically says there's two

94
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:56,800
aspects of living systems there's their organizational capacity their negentropic capacity

95
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:04,800
and then there's their code script their aperiodic crystalline informational repository

96
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:13,360
and then another place that coding comes up a little bit less in the source code space is

97
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:20,880
predictive coding and that's in a way highly compatible with active inference and gives a

98
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:27,520
deflationary account on how the semiotics are encoded rather than saying well this is what this

99
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:33,680
variable in the source code means or this is what this codes for or here's a code switch

100
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:41,600
predictive coding is like saying we're not even going to touch the semantics of what the sign is

101
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:49,040
itself we're just going to hypothesize that the way that information about the sign is transferred

102
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:56,400
is through this maximum information signaling approach called predictive coding because predictive

103
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:05,040
coding arose out of video compression algorithms and only at the end of the 90s was found to be

104
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:11,360
increasingly relevant for neural circuitry and so on so it's another example of where like a process

105
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:27,840
based approach ends up deflating or reframing the otherwise semantically loaded question

106
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,920
it's like switching out the question of like where we're going to be with how we're going to get there

107
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,520
and instead of only focusing on the meaning of the signs first off as if the meaning of the

108
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:45,600
signs could be discussed outside of their implementation and then even if we could figure

109
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,720
out what the signs were we would then just turn around and want to know how they were transmitted

110
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:57,120
and so predictive coding or predictive processing in a way short circuits that or

111
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:04,720
inverse it by first looking to explain how information is transmitted that could support

112
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:12,560
semiotics and then in the context of biological systems we naturally have biosemiotics

113
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:22,640
yeah i would ask the question when you talk about information being transmitted right what that

114
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:28,160
actually means and i think that's a very very big topic and a very large discussion in terms of

115
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:39,120
uh information information theory when specifically applying that into biological systems i think

116
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:44,480
there are some interesting people working on information that makes the case that Shannon has

117
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:52,160
a point and he's really interested not in the semantics or in the meaning or anything else it's

118
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:57,040
kind of interested in the problem of transmission and when you talk about transmission

119
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:06,800
it's worth to ask what is being transmitted exactly in the terms of of signals even if you're

120
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:12,560
capturing specific patterns and you think that the pattern is this thing that will be transmitted

121
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,080
in that sense but that would be a worth

122
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:28,240
a worth asking question to understand like the this notion of what is actually being

123
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:34,240
transmitted in that sense like the information probably this information theory is focusing

124
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:40,080
on this notion of the problem of transmission and then all the the concepts that come along to

125
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:47,840
explain that in terms of uncertainty or noise and everything that uh impacts this transmission

126
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:57,600
of processes and if you're saying like we're transmitting information in these things that

127
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:05,840
is breaking this semantic code apart yes it is because like the problem is not focused on that

128
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:13,520
it's that focusing on the specific correlations that we have that we call it we're mentioning

129
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:21,840
as information and how these correlations are an issue from from the cat go from what is being

130
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:28,880
picked up in one side being correlated to what comes into the other side right how that how do

131
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:37,440
you lose or gain more information in that but the deeper question here is

132
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:45,360
how can you say that you are actually gaining or losing that information because you are defining

133
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:51,120
this correlation that could be transmitted or not from the cat go if you don't have that

134
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,680
you don't have anything being actually actually communicated

135
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:04,960
so with that in mind you can explain these concepts in terms of function and then there's

136
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:16,080
a bunch of theories that navigate this sense of uh signaling that is specifically only functional

137
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,320
and then predictive coding tries to

138
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:29,200
try tries to push that a little further maybe but then you have to explain in

139
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,840
in a deep sense how this information is being actually transmitted and processed and I don't

140
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,400
think that is really really as obvious and as clear as we think it is

141
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:47,360
specifically when we're talking about this biological

142
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,280
way of nature navigating this process this this signaling

143
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:01,600
we have to talk about because the correlation if it's defined are being issued like from the

144
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:08,480
beginning you can only have this kind of transmission for someone specific that can

145
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,520
be able to understand that in the other side right

146
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:23,200
well certainly whether we're talking about a chemical pheromone that requires some type

147
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:31,280
of receptor or something more ephemeral like language that requires more of a semantic reference

148
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:39,120
frame there's no receiving the message without the sender it's like they're kind of the two

149
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:48,720
sides of the phone call um I'll ask a question from the chat love evolve how about cultural

150
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:56,240
encoding and principles in contrast to organizational so how do we think about

151
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:05,760
cultural meaning and is and is that similar or different than organizational

152
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:14,320
yeah that's that's a good point right I think if you take very seriously the example from

153
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:25,440
the forestry is a practice then I think it has to be organizational in that sense the meaning

154
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:32,960
navigates this organizational practice this organizational story that

155
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:43,440
that impacts not only communication between agents but also how

156
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:52,960
how the environment will be interpreted so and in this sense it will be transmitted

157
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,240
and repeated over time because it has a history you cannot ignore like the history of this

158
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:05,040
practices being pushed further and replicated through generations right so

159
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,080
the way like the villages will be

160
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,840
organized in terms of that specific practice for instance can be understood in a meaningful

161
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:26,320
and cultural way that organizes life in virtue of

162
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:38,000
some specific principles that sensitizes our agents towards specific directions

163
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,120
and I think

164
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:58,960
I don't I don't forget my point for instance you can talk about

165
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:12,320
if you think about archaeological findings and how archaeological

166
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:20,720
so descriptions of specific villages and how they navigate this mapping out this

167
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:32,400
this archaeological sites they usually know exactly if you have some kind of history already

168
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:38,160
from this this communities how this how that city will be likely to be organized

169
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:44,720
first off like where is the water and if the water is in certain directions probably

170
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:52,400
there will be certain kinds of relationships with housing and communal housings and where

171
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:59,200
are they going to place their dead in relation to this kind of specific organization principle

172
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:06,800
the water is here so plantations will be not so far away from that and this city organizes

173
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:13,440
like the village organized a little bit in this sense and that builds up cultural practices

174
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,880
at least archaeologically can be explained as such

175
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:30,080
I thought of something similar organization being the logistical or the operational structural

176
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:38,320
aspects so those would be the roads that connect the forestry outposts or the circulatory system

177
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:46,960
that connects the different organs of organization and then the culture is a cause and a consequence

178
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:54,960
of organization organization is the enabling conditions for culture to arise okay so given

179
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:02,960
this road network what cultures arise how similar or different are they convergently what are their

180
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,840
practices or their narratives that are shared amongst these different outposts

181
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:15,680
or in the bodily example okay given the organization of the organs literally the organizing

182
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:24,240
process or principle then what biosemiotics can arise with glucose and insulin and glucagon

183
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:32,560
and what culturally can arise maybe even in terms of the generative model of encultured

184
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:38,640
agents as a function of organization and then what are those encultured agents do

185
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:45,520
to the extent that they can modify organization and so these kinds of

186
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:55,360
um unrolling cause and consequence relationships can be hard to disentangle

187
00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:06,000
because there's not like a clean single starting point that can be separated out or because it

188
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:15,360
unfolds historically it's not exactly a reaction in a test tube

189
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:24,240
so how does active inference give us an entry point into thinking about this

190
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,320
yeah that's one interesting thing about active inference that you

191
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:37,760
you don't really need one uh you don't really need an origin point right you can

192
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:44,560
start start modeling you start understanding that at any any given point and build up from

193
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:53,760
from that story and see how it unfolds over time i think that's the most beautiful idea that you

194
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:59,520
you define your parameters and then you see from that parameter that can be arbitrarily defined and

195
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:07,280
you can navigate how things change within those parameters in the generative model right when

196
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:13,600
you when you have your like dynamical systems for instance you have your state space they have

197
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:23,680
some specific range of defining parameters that set the limits of the possible states that you're

198
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:33,600
going to navigate and if you use this notion that this two densities brings about in terms of

199
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:41,680
Bayesian modeling you can use these these kinds of tools to understand how from that specific

200
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:51,760
parameters update why what we narrate in active inference as if belief updating can change over

201
00:27:51,760 --> 00:28:02,880
time in these terms that's a very nice point it reminds me of Bruno Latour's actor network theory

202
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:09,600
or ants which kind of advocates a similar approach to what you describe which is like enter anywhere

203
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:19,440
open-mindedly because in an iterated modeling or iterated analysis setting the first proposal

204
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:26,320
or the first trace detected we know that's not the whole picture there may not be a whole or only

205
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:32,320
picture so we need to enter and iterate and then with active inference specifically because of the

206
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:38,560
compositionality that we get within a layer collective behavior and then also the kind of

207
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:48,480
nesting smaller things inside of bigger things we can always build something and then we can go oh

208
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:54,880
wow it's like there's a lot of top-down influence maybe there's a higher order factor or slower

209
00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:03,360
factor or a contextual factor we should consider or oh we were abstracting across these smaller

210
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:16,480
things inside but for a later day or if relevance we can dive in and so then it allows a light hold

211
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:24,320
or a grasp on the proposed generative model obviously it's map not territory but even

212
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:32,800
beyond that we always know that we can expand laterally and across scales starting from anywhere

213
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:45,280
in an iterated modeling process without our first or even 11th model being proposed as like

214
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:52,160
the accounts of some complex cultural phenomena which we're always going to only ever have our

215
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:59,920
own perspectives on yeah I think you don't really find that you being so oh all in copas

216
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:06,400
saying like you have one model that will model them all you can you you can navigate those models

217
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:13,040
in these more more instrumental terms it raises different questions when you put things like that

218
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:20,320
in terms of the ontology of models and models and theories and sciences but you they can be also

219
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:30,720
described as tools for describe tools for yeah tools for for grasping and describing

220
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:37,120
phenomena in a more non-committal way

221
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:49,040
how much that how much that smuggles in philosophical or more ontological problems

222
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:54,800
it's still I think under like debate but it is still

223
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:05,040
it's still uh it is still a tool to bring insights to think about specific cultural

224
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:14,480
collective uh phenomena which is not it's it's complicated to because I think what I'm getting

225
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:19,280
at I'm kind of like going back and forth but when you talk about social sciences and modeling

226
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:26,880
usually you have like ways of modeling agents or ways of modeling collectives and active inference

227
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:34,640
is trying to to come up with a a modeling in which you can understand agency and collectives

228
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:42,480
within the same modeling uh schema and I think the specific specifically for these

229
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:50,400
cases if you're interested in understanding uh types of cultural phenomena among language users

230
00:31:50,400 --> 00:32:00,080
in uh in specific contexts you can at least partially understand or have or gain some insight

231
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:07,120
in this agent-collective relationship that that is a little bit more interesting than

232
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:15,040
we have found so far in the social sciences because you can have like or specific understandings of

233
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:21,680
means but then how the agent where is the agency in that you you lose a little bit of agency

234
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:30,400
well when you're trying to understand uh only agents then you don't know how that

235
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:40,400
kind of scales up because active inference tries and offers this scale free uh modeling tools

236
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:49,840
that facilitates this this um conversion into agents agents and uh collectives

237
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:59,040
I would be interested in asking you actually how how do you navigate that when you talk about

238
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:03,360
social phenomena in ants or termites or

239
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:17,280
because then yeah you have very specific coding demarcations I guess for for this uh

240
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,520
social environments

241
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:34,400
yeah it's a great question it's also whether it's a uh open wounds or a dirty closet that's just

242
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:43,360
shut there's actually a lot of ambiguity and unresolved tension around well is the ant colony

243
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:50,880
social are they social insects that reifies the nest mate as the individual and then what

244
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:56,880
they're doing is like when we hang out and talk so reifying the nest mate as individual makes

245
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:04,080
the colony social but if the colony is individual then what nest mates are doing with each other

246
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:09,520
is not social anymore than we would describe the liver and the kidney as having like a social

247
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:15,520
single cellular interaction but we know that would be missing the point and so there definitely is

248
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:23,040
attention with some of these evolutionary lineages like ants being monophiletically

249
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:31,120
obligate you social all and only ants are you social they all live in the colonies there's no

250
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:38,320
free living nest mate whereas other parts of the evolutionary tree there are

251
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:46,240
life histories that do look a little bit more like social collaboration that can then

252
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:56,320
dissolve and so knowing what level of lock in makes something social

253
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:04,800
when are we socializing and what level of lock in goes beyond social and it kind of like makes

254
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:14,640
when the blanket is so strong around the social that like for multi-cellularity that it it's kind

255
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:22,400
of losing the social feature again because if we just use social to mean the connective tissue

256
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:34,480
or the kind of lubricant or the spaces between everything then it means nothing so a real attention

257
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:46,080
is what space does the social account for and is this going to be a concept with a lot of creep

258
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:52,960
looking well it's a social relationship between the roots of the tree and the fungus and it's a

259
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:59,360
social relationship amongst the molecules in the test tube is that too broad of a social conception

260
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:08,720
are there downsides or are there trade-offs associated with a broader social concept

261
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:14,400
social concept do we dilute what the social means and then on the other side

262
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:22,480
might we exclude phenomena that could importantly be considered social

263
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:28,880
well that's not social they're just talking on a train it's like well that's the other side

264
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:35,920
if we were to have carving out encounters that we do want to include as social and

265
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:46,480
and is there a true social does active inference help us sidestep or at least negotiate this territory

266
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:54,880
because we could develop a generative model or an ecosystem of shared intelligence with

267
00:36:55,600 --> 00:37:05,360
one person and two internet of things devices and a bird and a metronome and just say we made

268
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:15,520
what we made and then leave it as a second-order interpretation whether that is a social setting

269
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:26,000
I mean I think you you are pointing at like how I think granularity of those scales right

270
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,480
if you have a model that I want you want to everything that you already have it's probably

271
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:37,760
not interesting and not informative because you cannot like define those limits of what you're

272
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:44,320
trying to understand and in the other hand when you do that when you define those limits if you're

273
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:51,680
too narrow or you're gonna leave out you're gonna idealize also in a way right and leave out many

274
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:59,280
other parts of the system that you're interested in but if you don't do that if you don't

275
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:07,360
if you don't make this if you don't make this decision when modeling you think then how

276
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:19,040
how you can have any access to the phenomena right and and to connect this to the forestry

277
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:29,680
so in the forestry example the disirata was lumber now that may have been a very narrowly scoped

278
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:38,320
desire but it's it's a relevant thing to to want this resource and then industrialization

279
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:47,760
science as a process professionalization those allow the description and and the handling and

280
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:54,560
ultimately the kind of top-down legibility and control thinking like a forestry company now

281
00:38:55,360 --> 00:39:02,240
with respect to the social sciences by analogy to forestry science so now we're entering an

282
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:12,800
era of increased legibility and control of social systems and human natural capital and

283
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:22,800
attention as a resource trust as a resource in a way is being cropped analogous to produce the

284
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:30,960
content of lumber but now there are social content so as the social goes from being just

285
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:38,880
only simply the water we swim in not something that's even compared counterfactually to alternative

286
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:49,360
cultural possibilities per se but falls under the scope of the professional management like

287
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:56,720
forestry then that's when this discussion of well what's the lumber and what is the weeds that are

288
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:06,640
being pruned and what ecosystem services when we pay attention to certain parts of human social

289
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:16,880
culture and when we seek to make more of this kind of lumber what else does that come along with

290
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:26,720
and what decisions come into play and that comes along when you see

291
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,320
you

292
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:02,560
or instagram i don't know twitter after what happened to twitter but

293
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:16,080
but yeah the in terms of attention pruning you do have that very effectively already happening

294
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:24,800
already you can see how that happens if efficiently in the world in elections for instance it can be

295
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:32,160
very very easily manipulated and we saw what happened in elections for instance in brazil or in

296
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:46,720
the u.s and well all over you navigate a system of attention organization that

297
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:52,160
selects in only what he thinks that you're interested in

298
00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:00,640
in the effects of that in terms of decision making and in terms of trust in terms of

299
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:09,680
diversity of discourse we have seen that it can be devastating

300
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:17,600
so the and the question would be like how can you make this a little bit how can you use active

301
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:25,440
inference and these tools that we have to make this kind of technology a little bit more inclusive

302
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:30,400
without being super also disruptive is it even like

303
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:41,680
a possibility i really don't know i think it's an ethical problem that we have when we talk about

304
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:47,440
social systems and these principles of attention exclusion leaving things out

305
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:05,440
lot to say on that um with modeling and interpolating and models whether it's large

306
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:16,000
language model type or linear regression type it is able to interpolate to put data points within

307
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:25,040
an enclosure of what has already been described and Bayesian statistics and other types of

308
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:31,760
prediction algorithms are not immune to that either if we have some prior distribution belief

309
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:37,760
um we believe it's possible for it to be between 20 and 30 degrees outside

310
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:47,440
then when we get data inside of our bounds we can converge and that actually

311
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:53,680
tightens our beliefs not always a bad thing of course and then outside of the scope of the

312
00:43:53,680 --> 00:44:00,080
possible those data are just seen as noise and they may not even be integrated so then that

313
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:08,000
can lead to a reinforcing process not necessarily an adaptive one either where information that's

314
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:15,040
confirmatory is used to ratchet and increase precision and then information that is not

315
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:19,200
confirmatory is discarded as not useful

316
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:29,840
it doesn't yeah in this case is yeah it doesn't even enter the uh the landscape

317
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:33,280
of attention of the user in

318
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:45,520
what i what i'm what i was thinking in relation to this no this idea of

319
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:57,120
uh a forestry is because we have now organizational principles that are faster and

320
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:10,400
more populated with uh information and attention grabbing kinds of prompts

321
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,400
we transformed the same

322
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,200
we just from the same principle into

323
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:39,200
a harder to grasp process it's it's hard it becomes more complex it becomes harder to

324
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:47,040
describe this the process of understanding that in terms of forestry is kind of way more grounded

325
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:54,800
when you apply that socially to this kind of environment that we're talking like internet or

326
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:59,760
is highly uh volatile

327
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:11,280
and virtual in principle in environment it becomes much harder to assess what is being

328
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:15,360
pruned out or not you just don't know it makes it more clear that

329
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:22,160
there is a process of pruning you need to have no control of what is being taken out

330
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:29,760
you have no idea what's being like left away from your perspective of attention

331
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:41,760
so to this topic of intended or unintended semantic pruning i think um this has helped me

332
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:48,640
identify attention if we want to talk about the semantics or semiotics biosemionics whatever we

333
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:58,960
want to call it of the letter e in relationship to letter a we're looking for an account that might

334
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:07,600
convey letterness but we're generalized above enus or anus so in some ways we've erased or

335
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:18,320
abstracted generalized away from the particulars of the sign's meaning by taking a semiotic

336
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:28,960
perspective and so it's like we got into the game to have a semantic account of biological

337
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:43,360
phenomena or of any phenomena for biological entity yet this process in a sense distances us

338
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:51,360
from the particulars that actually do grant it that meaning in the actuality like if we

339
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:57,440
walk into a sacred space and it's like oh well that is just doing that over there and this

340
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:02,560
architecture is doing this and because of the layout people must use the room this way

341
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:17,440
that's removed from the actual meaning which is the cause and consequence with the organization and

342
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:29,840
culture that we discussed but that prima facia account doesn't generalize get any generalization

343
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:35,920
that we make so that we can talk about multiple places or multiple letters on a common

344
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:40,640
accounting framework is going to remove those particularities

345
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:49,040
so it's a very challenging catch 22 whether we want to really

346
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:58,480
account for the n equals one and maybe even live and act and play and work in the n equals one

347
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:05,680
versus develop something that might be satisfying and cut and dry but it's always going to be on

348
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:15,920
the sidelines with respect to what it actually means but what do you mean like is i don't understand

349
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:21,600
what you what you're getting at like is it you mean like it's generalized or not generalized

350
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:28,240
i didn't get that like when we have a general when we generalize when we

351
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:36,240
ask what words mean what what words mean beyond any given word we've lost touch with

352
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:44,720
what any given word means but words are what they actually mean in a situation

353
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:53,600
so it's just in this scientific approach to meaning semiotics and semantics

354
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:06,400
we have these two tensions or a tension to reconcile between actually giving an account

355
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:10,320
of the meaningfulness of the specific thing

356
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:16,080
versus taking a more scientific approach which would be

357
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:23,360
gathering a group of similar things and finding their shared attributes

358
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:28,640
which out of necessity must abstract must crop out

359
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:41,440
features that are are empirically or anecdotally taken to not matter like we abstract whether it

360
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:46,960
was a monday or tuesday that we did the experiments we just combine all of our replicates together

361
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,560
when we do the scientific analysis

362
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:57,280
you mean you mean if you generalize the practice you lose

363
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:03,280
what you're being if you generalize it too much you lose everything that's meaningful to it in

364
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:11,440
terms of like for you formalize it and then you have no yeah you have an empty semantics you

365
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:16,960
have a semantics with no meaning that can only be meaningful in terms of how you apply that in

366
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:22,320
terms of specific practices yeah it's like i i have a framework for you know the formal meaning

367
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:28,000
of letters within words within sentences within paragraphs and then it's like well but now what's

368
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:35,600
your next n equals one word that you're actually going to bring it's not just about building some

369
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:41,440
abstract scaffold yeah for bigger and bigger boulders of meaning

370
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:46,240
at some point through our embodied thought and action

371
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,760
in our experience it is going to come down into the particulars

372
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:58,000
and it doesn't immediately seem clear that simply generalizing further

373
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:01,920
brings us there

374
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:10,800
yeah yeah particularly i don't really believe you can have that kind of generalization i think

375
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:20,080
we attempt to build whatever what i see that's the interesting aspect of the formal semantics

376
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:22,400
you try to build this more general

377
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:33,520
understanding that's just formalizes to model but for that to be meaningful it has to be embedded

378
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:40,560
in a way of practicing it like in a forestry practice you have to be embedded in a cultural

379
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:48,720
environment in which that can be actually uh observed in terms of what happens when

380
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:52,800
a generative model is being updated or not

381
00:52:55,600 --> 00:53:00,320
is that what you mean because otherwise i don't really understand how it becomes too

382
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:09,840
yeah it becomes too formal it becomes too abstract in terms of some i would not understand

383
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:12,640
what that is

384
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:23,680
i'll i'll think of a little more um brand or tj do you want to add any thoughts or questions

385
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:31,520
yeah sorry i i think like i don't have a lot of context i've been like following some of the

386
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:41,760
discussion but not attended a lot of these calls i'm like it's all yeah yeah um yeah i didn't know

387
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:49,360
i think um yeah i'm in general just sort of interested in trying to understand the relationship

388
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:59,920
between um yeah like sorts of like constructionist epistemologies and um yeah like generative models

389
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:08,160
and active inference style stuff and um how active inference style like yeah what are the

390
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:13,520
philosophical commitments that active inference involves with respect to knowledge and epistemology

391
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:20,400
and there's a sense in which like rational choice models often assume a certain sort of like

392
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:26,960
objectivity to beliefs and then desires are where most of the degrees of freedom lie or something

393
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:32,480
um whereas there's a lot of like issue like there's a lot of things that come up once you

394
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:38,400
start talking about reflexivities where concepts themselves become self-fulfilling prophecies

395
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:44,960
what you believe about what your beliefs about society and shaping the society itself so there's

396
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:50,240
the sense in which there's a score dependence between the object of knowledge and knowledge about

397
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:56,720
that object itself and i think yeah like i'm sort of interested in like how the active

398
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:02,960
entrance ways of thinking about this offers what perspectives on those questions and stuff like

399
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:15,840
that um yeah thank you great questions yeah so when you talk about the uh object of knowledge

400
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:21,760
and knowledge itself and active inference uh

401
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:34,080
i think you you you can think of in terms of this

402
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:40,960
well there's a few ways to think about that i guess

403
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:50,640
uh the knowledge itself it has to come epistemically from where your agent

404
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:56,560
is actually embedded and situated in specifically an active inference it's embodied

405
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:04,960
it kind of needs to have a model the model is modeling a body is modeling a body that is in

406
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:12,400
the world and it's all the time uh situated is never disconnected to its environment and it's

407
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:22,720
history and how the history of that environment right yeah uh but if you think if you push that

408
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:28,080
to the object of that knowledge uh i don't know how how different

409
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:32,800
that will

410
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:41,280
how different how can you differ differentiate that so sharply when you talk about active inference

411
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,440
because

412
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:56,640
if you think of uh in terms of a generative model then what will be updated comes is updated from

413
00:56:56,640 --> 00:57:08,720
a prior that is always directed in this body in this situated realm so they sort of conflated

414
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:16,240
as i see maybe a maybe a mistaken but they sort of correlate in how you're gonna update your

415
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:24,480
generative model which it will be at the same time in at the same time what you know and what you

416
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:32,400
the object of this knowledge still i sorry if i can just like uh raise a question to that

417
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:37,520
yeah so i think like i think that there is a sense in which like with respect to

418
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:43,440
something that in epistemology we call self knowledge there is there is a question here

419
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:52,240
that the the active inference agent has this model of that is like situated in the body or like in

420
00:57:52,240 --> 00:58:01,040
in its like um like structure and is also modeling that structure itself and there is like this issue

421
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:07,840
of like where where yeah like the belief is not unidirectionally dependent on the object

422
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:13,680
sort of a thing but has this feedback loop thing comes up there but there's another way in which

423
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:20,000
i think like uh where this sort of thing comes where even if the object is outside of the body

424
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:27,760
of the knowledge i think that that could still come up so for instance if i live in it if an

425
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:34,720
active inference agent lives in a society of other active inference agents where currently all of them

426
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:42,080
defect on prisoner's dilemma but maybe like on further reflection they would want to like again

427
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:45,920
like i don't know what further reflection would mean in the active inference sense but i'm like just

428
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:53,040
saying in the intuitive sense like that what would it mean for them to like go from one fixed point

429
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:57,760
to another fixed point where they're all cooperating or or or something like that and

430
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:04,640
that that i think is not clear to me like how that shift can happen in active inference where

431
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:14,400
it's not just purely using the empirical information to keep running the the the middle of the of your

432
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:25,120
like free energy equation but also recognizing the contingencies and then identifying those

433
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:33,120
contingencies to make something like shifts from one state to another like if if i model that the

434
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:38,400
society is a cruel space and if everyone models the society is a cruel space then we will end up

435
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:44,240
creating a society that is a cruel space but if only we could recognize that our belief or our

436
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:51,120
model that society is a cool space is a contingent belief and we could all somehow negotiate or

437
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:58,320
communicate and shift to a different belief about what society is and society is a kind

438
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:06,560
place then we will end up creating that kinder society or something and that sort of like a

439
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:12,880
belief about the thing that society is it's not entirely within the agent like it's sort of

440
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:19,600
it it has a weird intersubjective character so it's not entirely outside of the agent either

441
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:28,960
but it's not entirely like internal to the agent either or something yeah yeah you can think of

442
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:34,560
that like you're talking about active inference action comes first right you have to you don't

443
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:41,520
have the knowledge like inside your head waiting for you to to push that out of the way action has

444
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:50,240
to come first so if you if you take that as a principle an organizing principle it depends on

445
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:58,000
the contingency of your actions the possibilities might be limited by your situated um condition

446
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:04,720
but they are limited it doesn't mean that you don't have like a range of options from that state

447
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:11,360
space in which you can go you can navigate so you can navigate it for the good or for the bad

448
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:17,520
but it starts with the the action perception loop it starts with the action

449
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:28,880
a lot of few other pieces on that teach a very good point like when we see the pragmatic component

450
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:36,400
of action as self-fulfilling epistemic component of action having to do with gaining knowledge and

451
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:40,880
the salience of information but the pragmatic component is about bringing our observations

452
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:47,600
into alignment with our preferences and then you identified two related settings one of them is like

453
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:57,440
pure intra subjectivity like I expect myself or I find myself or I habitually think about x well

454
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:03,520
that's kind of a trivial self-fulfillment because thinking about something is its own

455
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:12,800
fulfillment and then when we're in this second person or social space we can agree on little

456
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:20,960
performance art or on a game and games give evidence to that that when people are able to

457
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:28,640
perform communication or message passing such that new expectations or preferences are set

458
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:35,840
whether more top down like more seeing like a state or more laterally more like collective

459
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:42,640
behavior then those regimes can be embodied and then you brought up a very important point about

460
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:47,840
the awareness of the contingencies or where awareness is of adjacent possibles or of counter

461
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:57,040
factuals so the body might be we could model its morphology as doing some computation but that

462
01:02:57,040 --> 01:03:02,080
doesn't mean that the the morphology has an awareness or can explore a counterfactual

463
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:10,560
like bodies are not always exploring every counterfactual because skin is in the game

464
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:18,880
but again mentally it's very cheap and easy to consider counterfactuals and situational awareness

465
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:26,640
of social settings especially if it can be not understood but communicated opens up a space

466
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:32,080
where we're all playing prisoner's dilemma now there's parameterizations of prisoners multi-agent

467
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:39,600
prisoner's dilemma where tragically we just all defect all day and never learn there's also

468
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:45,920
parameterizations where you just start all cooperating and never defect and then the interesting

469
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:52,400
settings are where there might be like phase transitions or where perturbation moves the

470
01:03:52,400 --> 01:04:02,000
system from one attractor into another attractor so there's just a lot of richness and that's the

471
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:10,480
work of building generative models in that iterated modeling process to unpack and refine

472
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:18,000
and active inference isn't going to have a stance on the prisoner's dilemma we can use

473
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:22,560
active inference to to describe the prisoner's dilemma but active inference isn't going to come

474
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:29,440
down on on literally even a little two by two game theory matrix so we can then extrapolate that

475
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:35,280
active inference is not going to come down with an opinion on something significantly

476
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:50,960
more rich and real than a two by two game theory matrix and so that work is what people enact in

477
01:04:50,960 --> 01:05:02,400
applying active inference right and i think like my question is something like but insofar as like

478
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:13,200
humans try to constantly improve their social games how can we model that sort of a prior

479
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:18,720
or your actions or policies that enables that sort of like progressive

480
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:25,520
improvements or something well

481
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:33,280
you can we are assuming that we're trying to improve right we we don't know that but you

482
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:42,080
can model them as improving but like following Daniel's lead we're talking about these specific

483
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:47,280
games and contingencies they they did these these transitions from one state to another

484
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:53,760
specifically if you're talking about this modeling of social actors and talking about

485
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:59,360
several actors if you're modeling several of them will not be really linear right you don't

486
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:10,080
have like a easy smooth transition of improvement you can capture over time as modeling how they

487
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:17,520
might tend to go towards a direction and understand that as improvement but that takes

488
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:25,360
specific iterations that will not be fully linear i guess specifically if you want to

489
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:33,520
understand error and improvement instead of try an error but try and adding up into this

490
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:41,760
error like error improvement but when you're modeling specifically with dynamical systems

491
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:46,400
for instance you you you're not going to see a full linear story and i don't think you're

492
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:53,680
going to see that uh if you're modeling using active inference and multiple agents agents

493
01:06:53,680 --> 01:07:05,040
i'll add one piece there so how can we go about modeling multi-scale social goals so

494
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:15,760
we could think about you know different citizens in a region and they the modeler is going to

495
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:24,800
choose what knowledge to realize in the generative model like what you put into the calculator it's

496
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:36,080
going to calculate upon now this happens to be a elaborate stochastic method but if we only tell

497
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:41,360
people yeah there's just your personal income optimized for that your preference is to have

498
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:47,200
that be higher well then the simulation is going to unfold a certain way if we say well there's

499
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:54,960
your personal financial income and then there's your city and then there's your region then that

500
01:07:54,960 --> 01:08:04,000
opens up through through different mechanisms you know maybe an individual goes flat or neutral

501
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:11,600
on the personal in service of a larger win at a higher level well now what if the modeler says

502
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:15,760
it's not just about the financial income now we're also going to have this secondary criterion

503
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:23,600
well now different agents could attend differently to those two different outcome variables

504
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:30,640
and maybe there's one simulation where 50 only care about this and 50 care about that and it

505
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:42,240
works perfect or it doesn't work it's like a broad surveying you know or lego set or or grammar

506
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:56,080
or or active inference ontology for scoping very broadly and very inclusively but all the work is

507
01:08:56,080 --> 01:09:09,280
in the real simulation developments and sweeping because very little could be said about a game

508
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:15,600
theory game if you didn't know what the parameters were in the matrix you wouldn't know whether this

509
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:20,880
prisoner's dilemma was going to be like an always cooperate or which agents with which strategies

510
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:28,000
would or wouldn't cooperate if you don't know what the matrix looks like so before the values have

511
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:35,920
kind of been filled in it's just like actually describing the adjacencies and the counterfactuals

512
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:44,720
and the contingencies of our scientific model but that's still prior to having the model in hand

513
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:50,160
and the model you know so now we're looking at that tree in the european forest

514
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:54,480
and it's like well if i had this tool then i could cut it down this way if i had this tool

515
01:09:54,480 --> 01:10:03,520
i could cut it down this way or i could wait it's like that's alternative actions about that tree

516
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:09,920
now in the social science setting discussion of different scientific methodologies are like

517
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:14,240
counterfactuals about that social tree

518
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:33,440
yeah and specifically if you're navigating these kinds of game theoretical models if that's what

519
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:40,160
you're interested in you can even define in terms of prisoner's dilemma for instance

520
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:52,960
specific values just see what happens when everybody deflects and in how frequent

521
01:10:53,920 --> 01:11:00,960
modulate those frequencies in terms of specific in multiple iterations how

522
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:11,680
how how are you gonna build up the weight or the tendency of deflecting again if your neighbor

523
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:20,080
deflected once and deflected twice or three times or and see how that will accommodate

524
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:28,160
over time how many times this agent will change its behavior until it stops changing the behavior

525
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:31,120
but that you don't really

526
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:41,120
that's that that again you use you might use a bayesian understanding a bayesian model for that

527
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:44,000
but it not necessarily explain

528
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:49,840
me

529
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:59,520
he does not necessarily explain the action fully i mean social you just you're modeling only the

530
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:11,120
interest of that specific actor i have a slightly meta question if i can ask both of you i'm not

531
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:18,080
sure how these calls usually go i'm curious what are your interests in active inference what do you

532
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:23,280
think like what brings you to active inference and like what do you think what do you think active

533
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:30,960
inference adds to our theoretical understanding and in what ways or something the right now go for it

534
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:34,240
well

535
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:44,240
i think i was trying to touch upon that before and how we can if you're navigating for instance

536
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:48,800
behavior in terms of game theory this kind of modeling if you're talking about like

537
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:55,760
trust games for instance you're gonna understand how this do addict interactions evolve over time

538
01:12:55,840 --> 01:13:03,200
specifically over interactions but you don't have an account of change because i have very

539
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:11,520
limited options of actions and you don't have an account also on scales and i think active

540
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:16,720
inference tries to add a little bit an account on how you can scale that and how

541
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:19,680
how

542
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:29,600
how can add more parameters into the game and see how they evolve with a more clear

543
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:36,080
understanding a richer understanding that for instance when you talk about specific

544
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:45,600
interactions in game theory so when that's one one aspect that active inference kind of

545
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:54,320
contributes another point is because we have this parameterization that is

546
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:59,920
specifically in terms of belief updating and also in terms of dynamics

547
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:09,440
we are always talking about agents that will be situated and embodied and have a very specific

548
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:11,440
uh

549
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:19,680
synchronization with the environment all the time because when you talk about active inference

550
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:25,840
the action comes always first so you have a less you try to have a less reductive model

551
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:34,160
specific and when you want to model cultural agents and collective action i think that's

552
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:42,640
kind of desirable that's what you're looking for is it also your area of interest sorry is it also

553
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:54,240
your area of interest mine or is that laryna's area of interest laryna's what do you mean oh sorry

554
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:59,280
like my question was also like what brings you to active inference and i think you answered a lot

555
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:05,760
of ways in which active inference adds theoretical value but i wasn't sure like if that was also

556
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:11,840
your subjective interest or motivation it's my subjective interest yeah i'm curious to see how

557
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:19,600
that pans out right i'm interested in how that helps us to to think of this type of

558
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:22,720
uh

559
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:30,160
phenomena and i'm very interested in how this relationship for agents to collectives and back

560
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:31,360
again work like

561
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:43,440
and i think it might give us some well it gives us some very insightful way of modeling

562
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:45,440
these relationships

563
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:55,600
in navigating is as you want because this this uh feature of being scale free is kind of helpful

564
01:15:57,120 --> 01:16:04,000
to looking things you can you can define your uh mark of blanket in terms of what you're interested

565
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,560
right and see what happens

566
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:16,800
i don't know yeah i'll i'll i'll just give a few thoughts even though also surely some of these

567
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:24,880
thoughts are are scattered um you asked tj what does active inference add to our theoretical

568
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:33,200
accounts of the social it does many things in in my view and that's what makes it so valuable

569
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:42,080
epistemically and pragmatically it gives us the expressivity within a scale to describe

570
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:49,200
collective behavior and across scales to describe nested systems so that brings continuity to

571
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:54,880
discussions of the social with broader discussions of the biological ecological

572
01:16:55,520 --> 01:17:01,760
computational physical and so on so that's a multi-scale transdisciplinary element

573
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:09,840
active inference provides us with legible first principles which can either be taken

574
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:18,400
instrumentally as just heretics and also in certain situations can be viewed empirically

575
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:26,720
as justifiable first principles and then from those legible first principles which are not

576
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:34,240
english specific they're already in a space that has a lot more

577
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:45,120
possibility and promise then for example a mere enumeration of important adjectives or nouns

578
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:50,000
we can develop lists of important adjectives and nouns

579
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:58,720
when we have a broader cognitive modeling framework and so this methodological turn

580
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:07,440
then supports just a tremendous diversity of thought and work instead of asking us to kind of

581
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:13,520
go through the eye of the needle and you know get on board with this one ranking of features

582
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:20,000
and then try to apply it more broadly that's like an overfit before the cart situation

583
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:27,680
with active we can expand the methodological discussion connect it to theoretical physics

584
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:33,440
and mathematics in ways that really haven't been seen before and then that opens up more

585
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:42,000
than it closes down it brings up more questions than it resolves in and of itself but it opens

586
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:49,680
the questions that can be resolved like what generative model can I make that will keep the

587
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:55,360
temperature in this building livable but active inference isn't going to have a stance on what

588
01:18:55,360 --> 01:19:03,280
you should do for that building so we need to in a way take a step in the methodological direction

589
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:12,480
which I see as moving towards active inference to enable a million steps in different directions

590
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:24,320
I have a bunch of questions here I think one is probably just a reference question

591
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:30,960
the three topics that I'll say if you guys have any papers or articles on those things I would love

592
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:39,520
to like get a reference one is in what ways can we model a collection or an aggregation of active

593
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:48,240
inference asians as a like super agent or like super like active inference super agent or something

594
01:19:48,240 --> 01:19:54,880
and like how does this like decomposition and aggregation like flexibility work in different

595
01:19:54,880 --> 01:20:02,560
contexts like if there's like work that tries to either make informal commentary or formal

596
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:09,520
modeling either ways I would love to see that secondly just quick on the first just on the first

597
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:16,800
check out the previous section of this course on collective behavior where I reviewed many

598
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:23,920
such works great thanks okay is it on the same notion is it linked from the same notion things

599
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:30,400
all in the same places and in the same playlist with this course same syllabus yes good okay

600
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:40,640
the second is is there an active inference account of say markets or economic interaction

601
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:48,560
where like your prices act as some sorts of like information signals and like like can use active

602
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:55,200
inference to then talk about aggregation in of market entities or something I'm guessing this

603
01:20:55,200 --> 01:21:01,600
would also be covered in the same list indeed people have explored cognitive economics and

604
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:07,200
people are working on it but that doesn't mean it's a done deal theoretically or especially in

605
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:13,760
practice so keep going it's quite experimental still but there are a bunch of people working on

606
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:22,800
that I guess I don't remember any specific paper right now but I can I can look it up and forward

607
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:31,200
to you but yeah yeah it would be great I can drop my email address here yeah sure the third is

608
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:36,880
probably more trickier than both of these which is is there an active inference account of natural

609
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:48,640
language um yes thankfully colleagues like Elliot Murphy and others have explored specifically

610
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:59,920
the linguistic aspects of natural speech I think Lorena's lecture and area of focus generalizes

611
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:07,360
a bit beyond specific natural language because we're talking about semiotics and semantics

612
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:14,960
in a more intermodal sense however yes there's been limited work from a computational

613
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:24,400
linguistics and neurobiology perspective on speech okay so then

614
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:33,840
okay so you said something like first principles stuff when you're making a commentary on what

615
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:39,680
active inference brings I have still I have I'm still often like struggling what is active

616
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:45,200
inference offering and I like try to encounter different things I think I enjoy a lot of

617
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:50,560
philosophical questions at the conversation opens up but like I'm still like very ambivalent about

618
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:59,120
the theory um and when I read like this new book uh which Friston has not written uh but like is

619
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:07,280
and quarter I don't remember was the name of the book um uh yeah I don't exactly remember there's

620
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:12,960
a book right which is like supposedly like supposed to be the canon and like Friston as a

621
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:23,280
co-author but in the preface he says so so that's the 2022 par Friston Pazulo textbook right par yeah

622
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:31,360
yeah I wouldn't quite say it's the canon since it's a short book but certainly it is a landmark

623
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:38,880
moment for the fields right and when I read that the one thing that bothered me was

624
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:49,680
it brings up the Helmholtz free energy thing but it sort of argues that by fiat like okay this is a

625
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:57,280
simple principle it can model a lot of things but that doesn't tell me why I should why I should

626
01:23:57,280 --> 01:24:04,320
trust it like what what is the reason to act why why does this principle lead to cognition like

627
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:10,720
what like sure you're positive a very simple principle and then said hey look this simple

628
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:16,320
principle can explain so many things but well it can it also explain things that don't look like

629
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:24,880
cognition and like I like I'm not sure like there's an I got an account of why that principle is like

630
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:34,400
uh works or something the rain I go for it I'll think of some other ways to say it yeah you can

631
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:41,440
think of like modeling by construction and modeling by first principles and if modeling by first

632
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:49,840
principles you have you have some limitations in which you cannot fully explain some things but

633
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:55,520
the virtue of the model and how the first principle organizes everything that comes along with the

634
01:24:55,520 --> 01:25:03,120
model usually might be sufficient or might be a useful a useful tool to help you explain that

635
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:10,800
phenomena that based on the first principle that you were bringing along and that's one way of

636
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:17,120
one part of answering this question is I think it might be a big question for the for the field

637
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:24,080
for the field yeah here here's some short little threads on that

638
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:32,480
yeah we can describe maladaptive cognitive systems or adaptive cognitive systems whether

639
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:38,080
something's adaptive or not is always in relationship to its niche like the foraging algorithm that

640
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:44,320
works in the desert doesn't necessarily work in the rainforest so these systems are like intrinsically

641
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:52,080
adaptive or not we want to have natural language that allows sentences that are valid and invalid

642
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:56,880
and have different kinds of semantics so again this is just an expressivity framework

643
01:25:57,680 --> 01:26:05,520
that enables people to build cognitive models of high reliability or important settings or you

644
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:11,040
could make something that looks just like a beautiful circuit board and not even worry about

645
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:16,400
what the outcome is so yeah for sure you can describe all kinds of systems that would be like

646
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:23,600
having a less than functional methodological system if we said well we're doing the linear

647
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:28,240
regression framework but we only want positive regressions it's like well no at the methodological

648
01:26:28,240 --> 01:26:34,000
level we want it to be able to do any slope so here in the cognitive modeling setting we want

649
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:38,480
more expressivity so that we can actually construct the ones that we're interested in

650
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:48,400
and then how does this really do cognition how is it that a first principles like surprise

651
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:54,000
minimization or the bounding of surprise through free energy how can that really cover

652
01:26:55,120 --> 01:27:02,800
so many cognitive phenomena that's the question and the play but how is it that

653
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:08,880
Newton's laws of motion can describe so many objects being dropped off a tower

654
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:17,840
how is it that Bayesian mechanics can describe so many different priors being updated

655
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:26,080
and so by understanding cognitive paths as paths of least action which is the free energy principle

656
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:43,600
a wide variety of models become of a of a similar kind now yeah whether that's useful to a given

657
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:47,920
person in a given setting like if you make an active inference model of your business it doesn't

658
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:52,000
mean you're gonna succeed if you make a self-driving car with active inference it doesn't mean it's

659
01:27:52,000 --> 01:28:01,040
gonna work this isn't a guarantee of success but it's a method that can be utilized and we know

660
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:08,720
that the method reaches different kinds of modeling outcomes and supports subsequent

661
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:15,920
perspectives and models from where it reaches but we can't a priori limit where the method reaches

662
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:22,080
to like only the successful ones or only biological systems then we wouldn't even have

663
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:26,480
the expressivity to talk about cognitive ecosystems with synthetic intelligences

664
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:34,800
um and when you're talking about cognition also we can use this kind of first principles

665
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:41,200
to model aspects of cognition but you might not necessarily think that cognition is all encompassing

666
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:46,800
like that everywhere all the same but you can ease that to model specific things that you're

667
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:53,760
interested in in cognitive behavior like adaptivity does it give me any insight to understand what is

668
01:28:53,760 --> 01:29:00,640
adaptive adaptive behavior for instance and which kind of insights do i get are they interesting

669
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:07,760
are they useful so that's what the availability that this kind of model bring along so you can

670
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:12,880
you don't have to believe in in the whole story but it gives you a lot of leverage

671
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:17,440
to ask ask questions and what kind of questions you'll be asking

672
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:27,200
okay so let's say that like free like active inference and free energy allows me to talk about

673
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:36,800
systems but does it give also give me vocabulary to then classify those systems

674
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:43,280
in terms of let's say adaptivity would be one property but like there could be other properties

675
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:54,000
in terms of like how much how rich the world model is or stuff like that or yeah um if you have

676
01:29:54,640 --> 01:30:00,880
a portfolio of generative models you could summarize them according to the tj statistic

677
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:06,960
you could summarize them according to the number of nodes you could put them into a common environment

678
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:13,200
or different environments and summarize their activity in any number of ways but we can't

679
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:19,840
talk about a ranking or summarization of a portfolio of generative models that's not in hand

680
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:24,080
this is a framework that lets us build those diverse generative models

681
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:30,880
and then in a very open-ended way do model comparison model selection model adequacy

682
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:38,880
all the kinds of complex systems engineering methods that we want

683
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:50,320
and also I would ask you where do you see a peer or a comparison first principle

684
01:30:51,680 --> 01:30:56,240
you know active inference has legible first principles which are reflected in the active

685
01:30:56,240 --> 01:31:01,360
inference ontology and expressions using it which can be represented in natural language so that's

686
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:08,080
the talking about it but it's not only represented in natural language other frameworks have other

687
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:15,440
first principles that may or may not be legible and people may choose different paths to go down

688
01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:22,560
for whichever number of reasons well right models like they have the virtue you can compare them

689
01:31:22,640 --> 01:31:27,120
and see which one gives you the best insight that you're looking for

690
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:35,360
well so yeah I think like something that I could compare to active inference is like say the

691
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:42,800
Bayesian utility maximization thing and which has a different ontology I'm not a fan of that either

692
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:50,320
like that also I'll just note that Bayesian utility maximization is a special case of free energy

693
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:58,160
where there's no epistemic value all you have is pragmatic value and so a special diminished case

694
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:03,520
not necessarily you have value of information and you have explore exploit trade-offs

695
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:11,440
in Bayesian utility maximization as well like you like like if you load into your utility function

696
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:18,000
if you can beg the question and load episteme into pragma you're right then all you need is

697
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:24,800
pragma but in expected free energy we have epistemic and pragmatic value which is what enables

698
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:33,760
us this expressivity but I think we're aligned on that right I think like I'm somewhat like also

699
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:38,640
slightly confused because in the Bayesian utility like between the languages comparing the languages

700
01:32:38,640 --> 01:32:46,880
as such like in the Bayesian utility maximization the exploration parts that are prioritized based on

701
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:58,800
your X and the estimation on the value of information whereas I'm not sure that holds true

702
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:07,280
for the active inference model as well that the epistemic exploration is prioritized or valued

703
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:20,640
in terms of some of the same pragmatic thing as well. You'll have a lot to explore and learn

704
01:33:20,640 --> 01:33:27,520
you can make a model that is 80-20 or 20-80 or 100-0 between epistemic and pragmatic

705
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:32,640
there's nothing we can say across generative models about whether active inference prioritizes

706
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:42,800
episteme or not because you can make a model that's 100% or 0. Sorry I meant more like does active

707
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:48,000
inference allow us to talk about systems that the Bayesian utility maximization doesn't allow us to

708
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:55,360
talk about. I'm talking particularly about expressive power of the language. Are there

709
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:59,520
things that the Bayesian utility maximization can talk about that active inference cannot

710
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:03,200
other things that active inference can talk about that Bayesian utility maximization cannot.

711
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:11,360
Two short answers one short answer utility maximization must cram epistemic value into

712
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:17,920
pragmatic value we gain more expressivity when we can articulate out pragmatic value which is the

713
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:23,040
alignment of preferences with observations from epistemic value which is information gain so

714
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:29,440
that's a huge articulation and the second thing is when you're in a anything maximization framework

715
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:33,840
when you're in a utility function now again bagging the question how you constructed this

716
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:38,960
function that you're trying to maximize. When you're in a maximization framework we have a well

717
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:47,280
known set of approaches for finding local and global maxima using optimization or maximization

718
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:54,000
frameworks. What active inference uniquely provides is it describes the path that that

719
01:34:54,000 --> 01:35:03,280
cognitive thing takes as a path of least action that minimizes surprise so instead of climbing

720
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:08,720
to the top of the hill up are we on a foothill or are we on the biggest hill we're like a ball rolling

721
01:35:08,720 --> 01:35:14,320
to the bottom of the hill finding the least surprising path now that least surprising path

722
01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:21,280
can still include novelty and information gain but it turns out to be a lot more tractable

723
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:25,840
and connected with statistical physics and quantum mechanics when we talk about the path of

724
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:32,240
least action ball rolling down the hill rather than this sort of question bag on top of a mountain

725
01:35:32,240 --> 01:35:40,960
climbing adventure Bayesian utility approach. But it's up to each person to feel how they want to

726
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:49,040
feel. Yeah it's a little bit what's in the book as well when you take the low and high road for

727
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:58,960
energy principle right because how much you want to have your utility maximization function being

728
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:04,720
disconnected to the pragma to do to the action.

729
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:12,400
Because when you're modeling behavior it will be hard to do that independently like you have a

730
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:18,800
lot of you have way more assumptions you're committing too much to a greater level of assumptions

731
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:21,920
for your utility function if you don't do that.

732
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:33,120
Because with the pragma with the action first that pragmatizes you have reasons to describe

733
01:36:33,120 --> 01:36:40,080
have reasons to believe why that information gain works the way that it does. You can leverage

734
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:47,840
explanations on that without it you have a model that has more assumptions and I think if you have

735
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:52,640
a model with less assumptions it's always healthier let's say so.

736
01:36:55,120 --> 01:37:01,200
Yeah so I think like that that that does talk about the compare compare the analysis of the

737
01:37:01,200 --> 01:37:08,000
expressivity but I would also say as a meta point that like I'm not happy with either of those languages

738
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:15,760
I'm like I suspect that both of those languages claim certain ontological assumptions and I'm

739
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:20,000
like always suspicious but wait but like where are these ontological assumptions coming from.

740
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:31,280
A few other points we tap into an absolutely meaningful nexus of statistical methods and

741
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:36,400
message passing schemes with active inference if you can state something in the active inference

742
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:44,080
ontology and construct a generative model then message passing algorithms can be deployed that

743
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:49,360
contractively compute that model so that's absolutely non-trivial otherwise it's possible

744
01:37:49,360 --> 01:37:56,480
just to get wrapped up in some analytical formalism but then once you want to do that on a 4k video

745
01:37:57,920 --> 01:38:02,880
now you're on square zero with the computer engineering this is not that way and then I

746
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:09,200
will respond to your meta point with a meta point which is when we've enumerated the alternatives

747
01:38:10,160 --> 01:38:16,400
the one that we like best personally I feel happy with I'm also open to new alternatives arising but

748
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:28,800
being unhappy when all things considered is in play why. What bothers you specifically on the ontology

749
01:38:29,360 --> 01:38:43,200
of the active inference. Yeah like I think like I'm still looking for I don't know what exactly

750
01:38:43,200 --> 01:38:47,920
I'm looking for but I'm I feel dissatisfied with the account given for why Helmholtz free energy

751
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:57,520
least action thing like is the central thing here or something like why does it work like why

752
01:38:57,520 --> 01:39:09,200
does this principle yeah. There's a lot of funny answers I could give there that that delta that

753
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:16,960
discrepancy that's curiosity and that's the space of the open and that's learning and that's your

754
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:26,480
unique contribution to make and that's everything so that's not just a thorn in your shoe that's like

755
01:39:27,520 --> 01:39:36,480
our experience of action amidst uncertainty which is the water we're in and so whether we

756
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:42,320
take a higher order narrative perspective on that discrepancy being dissatisfying

757
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:48,720
or that discrepancy being satisfying I think it's pretty. I just need to minimize my surprise there

758
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:52,640
yeah and you can choose to minimize your surprise through your attention

759
01:39:53,440 --> 01:40:01,120
you can choose to minimize surprise at a higher narrative order like I'm satisfied and complacent

760
01:40:01,120 --> 01:40:05,680
that I don't understand number theory but I use numbers to count objects around me

761
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:10,160
so that discrepancy and understanding knowing that there's a thousand years of research

762
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:17,520
that could be done on numbers it doesn't unsettle me but for someone else that might be unsettling

763
01:40:18,240 --> 01:40:22,480
and that might lead them to ruminate it also might lead them to do a phd and number theory

764
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:30,000
so just different paths for different individuals and contexts but there's always so many technical

765
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:40,400
and meta levels with active huh. Okay so I don't want to like keep you guys over time but I would

766
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:46,800
ask one last reference based thing which is are there active inference accounts of seeing

767
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:53,760
like a state phenomena uh in any literature I think I heard you mention it once so I was like

768
01:40:53,760 --> 01:41:04,160
yeah like this yeah check out live stream 33 series but also this course that we're literally

769
01:41:04,160 --> 01:41:15,200
actually enacting in with Avel is where these accounts come to roost and where we're creating

770
01:41:15,200 --> 01:41:21,360
a space to develop it and it's not a cathedral for us just to spectate at today but if you

771
01:41:21,360 --> 01:41:27,360
want to make an active inference generative model of whatever social setting when you have the model

772
01:41:27,360 --> 01:41:38,560
in hand a lot of your questions will be sidestepped okay where is the 33 thing that you mentioned

773
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:46,240
if you go to the page with all of our institute live streams and look in the live stream

774
01:41:46,240 --> 01:41:52,400
series like the paper discussions in the 33 series there's a dot zero video with background and

775
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:58,320
context and then we have a dot one and a dot two conversation with the authors but Avel who's also

776
01:41:58,320 --> 01:42:05,920
the course coordinator for this course and kairos research like Avel's and and colleagues work has

777
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:14,160
heavily built on the seeing like a state thinking like a state optimal grasp all these different

778
01:42:14,160 --> 01:42:23,520
topics yeah I'm yeah I'm on your youtube channel I'm slightly finding it hard to find the thing

779
01:42:26,160 --> 01:42:33,440
if you look up live stream 033.0 or if you go to in the video description of any video where it says

780
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:38,640
all live streams here go there and search for but you'll find it and you can always email us

781
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:45,840
or get in contact but yeah and I think Avel's paper like thinking like a state also can help

782
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:53,520
you a lot to understand how how active inference modeling is useful for the social sciences in

783
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:59,600
comparison to other types of modeling he makes an comprehensive description interesting

784
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:10,080
great thanks and this is this is our first iteration on this course we are going to continue

785
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:15,520
bringing new information to the table and supporting individuals who want to build

786
01:43:15,520 --> 01:43:22,160
generative models you know around this area whether it's part of an internship program

787
01:43:22,160 --> 01:43:28,560
or part of a course credit or different kinds of programs that we'll be able to develop but

788
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:35,200
this is the real thing and we're able to work with people who want to think and do

789
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:44,560
make sense indeed any closing thoughts on tj then I will go and then Lorena with last word

790
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:49,440
um no that this was great thanks thanks for the conversation

791
01:43:51,280 --> 01:43:57,600
thank you well thank you for bringing tj for joining Lorena for the lecture this was a fun

792
01:43:58,400 --> 01:44:05,040
discussion we never really know where how it's gonna go but I'm glad that we could cover

793
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:15,440
so many of these topics and probably raise more questions and footholds than door slams so thank

794
01:44:15,440 --> 01:44:24,160
you again Lorena yeah thank you for inviting me and I think active inference like holds a lot of

795
01:44:24,160 --> 01:44:30,160
space for experimenting as well some things you try to see if they make sense and they're gonna hold

796
01:44:30,160 --> 01:44:38,880
up and open new questions and that might be an interesting aspect of uh of the framework itself

797
01:44:41,840 --> 01:44:46,080
thank you everybody thank you everybody for the great live chat comments there's a lot

798
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:49,600
there I couldn't read at all so till next time

799
01:45:16,080 --> 01:45:17,300
you
