0	15200	Hello and welcome, everyone. It's July 22nd, 2024. This is Active Inference guest stream
15200	23400	82.3. The Projective Wave Theory of Consciousness. Robert Warden will give a presentation and
23400	28920	we have several others to join and comment and give their insights. So thank you everyone
28920	34360	for joining and Robert, please begin the presentation. And also, Robert, close the YouTube on your
34360	35440	side. All good.
35440	39320	It's Active Inference guest stream 82.3.
39320	39840	Right.
39840	45400	I've objectively, it's coming through on my loud speaker, which is a problem.
45400	47960	Yeah, it's all good. Like, all good.
58920	87240	Okay. So this is a talk about the Projective Wave Theory of Consciousness. And there's
87400	93080	already a paper about it on Archive this month. So you can look at the paper if you like.
93080	100440	But let me start by describing roughly the roadmap for the talk. The Projective Wave
100440	106200	Theory is very closely related to the Projective Consciousness Model, PCM. And we're fortunate
106200	111880	to have three of the authors of that model on the call today. But I'm going to give this talk
112120	119960	in four different parts. The first part is talking about data. And the idea is that any theory of
119960	126200	consciousness has to fit the data, has to fit some data in order for us to believe it. And so the
126200	131800	question is, what kinds of data is there about consciousness that the theory has to fit? And I
131800	138120	should be arguing that the main kind of data we have is spatial consciousness. So that's part one
138840	143400	of the talk. Part two, I shall talk about the Projective Consciousness Model, PCM. And to my
143400	149480	mind, the big virtue of the PCM is that it does predict account for just that, the spatial nature
149480	155880	of consciousness. And in that, it's a great deal. It does a great deal better than many neural theories
155880	162680	of consciousness. And I shall probably pause at that point after parts one and two and have
162680	169960	discussion about the first two points there. But before that, I think the PCM has great
169960	176280	strengths. But I think in common with all neural theories of consciousness, it has three problems.
176280	181160	And I shall talk about what those problems are. But I shall emphasize that those problems are not
181160	189080	specific to the PCM. If you buy into the classical neural model of the brain that neurons do everything,
189080	193000	then whatever your theory of consciousness, I think you're going to have these problems.
193000	198440	And so in order to get out of those problems, we have to do something that's not in the classical
198440	203960	neural model that assumes that neurons in the brain do everything. So we have to add something
203960	210280	to the PCM. And the something we have to add is there in three. The assumption we're going to add
210280	215080	to it is quite a big one. It's an assumption that there is a wave in the brain which stores
215080	221640	3D spatial information. In other words, neurons don't do everything. And then part four of the
222520	227880	talk, I shall bring those two and three together to a projective wave theory of consciousness.
227880	233400	And talk a little bit about firstly, how it solves the neural problems, but secondly,
233400	238520	how it fits the data and some more general considerations about it. So that is the root
238520	247720	map of the talk. So we start off with what are the reasons to believe some theory, whether
247720	252840	there's theory of consciousness or anything else. Why do we believe it? Basically, we believe a
252840	258760	theory because it fits data. And it there's a complexity measure here that needs to fit more
258760	263720	data, which you can measure in bits, if you like, than the complexity of the assumptions you put
263720	268040	into it. If you just put in a huge number of assumptions and fit a small amount of data,
268040	273720	that's no use. So there's a kind of Bayesian balance between the assumptions you put into a
273720	279640	theory and the data it fits. And I've illustrated the Bayesian balance, a pair of scales here. And
279640	287000	I've measured the complexity of the theory and the amount of data it tests by a so-called zip
287000	292280	test, which simply says you describe these things in text files, you zip them up and you see how big
292360	298040	they are. So established theories in science like a theory of physics or chemistry have a hugely
298040	303080	positive Bayesian balance. They have quite few assumptions and they account for huge amounts
303080	308440	of data. So how can we get to that point with the theory of consciousness? How can a theory of
308440	314840	consciousness produce a positive Bayesian balance between its assumption and the data it accounts
314840	321640	for? So the question arises, what is the data we have to test theories of consciousness? And there's
321640	326280	a big problem, which is well known, that consciousness is a private experience. So there's not much
326280	332120	public data about it. But there are several kinds of data we can use, such as data about levels of
332120	339000	consciousness, alertness and being asleep and so on, data about quality. And they are problematic
339000	345560	because they're private phenomena. But nevertheless, two people can agree something about similarity
345560	352760	scales of their quality, like different colors being similar or different. And the form C is the
352760	359720	shapes of things in spatial consciousness. And I shall argue that the main manifestation of
359720	366520	consciousness, which we have, what we're experiencing right now, is a 3D spatial model of the world
366520	374440	around us. And that 3D model is very detailed and quite faithful to the real world around us.
374440	382440	And so that has a large information content. Going down the list, there's conscious imagination,
382440	387240	there is consciousness of the self, there are anomalies and illusions of consciousness,
387240	392440	and there is the hard problem, if you like, the existence of consciousness itself. Now I shall
392440	399560	argue that point C, the shape of spatial consciousness gives us much more data to test any theory
399560	406200	than any other type of data. So what's the testable data in spatial consciousness?
408920	413720	Spatial consciousness is like a 3D model of the real world around you. That's what you're
414520	420600	experiencing right now. And it has a lot of the geometry of the real world, and particularly
420600	426600	straight lines in consciousness correspond to straight lines in the real world. And you can
426600	432040	test this. I won't go into the years of how. So this agreement between our conscious experience,
432040	436920	which is quite information rich, and the real world around us, which is obviously information
436920	443480	risk, gives a lot of data to test any theory of consciousness. And I suggest roughly it gives
443480	450120	us thousands of bits, even in a few seconds. And I shall suggest that no other form of data
450120	455080	about consciousness comes anywhere close to this in terms of testable information content.
456040	461240	So if you really want to prove your theories right, then it's got to account for the spatial
461240	466760	form of consciousness if you're going to believe it. And down at the right here, I put my conclusion
466760	472040	that spatial consciousness is, if you like, the element in the room, consciousness theory.
474200	480760	So we have to consider how the brain does spatial cognition. And all animal brains pretty much do
480760	487400	that. They have to understand 3D's local space for a very fundamental reason, just to control
487400	491960	their every movement, to move every movement of their limbs, they have to understand 3D space
491960	497160	around them. And there's been huge selection pressure to do this well. And we believe that
497160	503720	animals do it very well, even insects do it quite well. And also it appears that most of the animal
503720	510280	brain is devoted to that. Now, if we assume a Bayesian hypothesis about cognition, then the way
510280	515800	animals do that is to build a maximum likelihood 3D model of local space in their brains from their
516360	523560	sense data. So it becomes fairly natural to expect that spatial consciousness is going to be linked
523560	529320	to this spatial model. And the question is, is it a purely neural model as a classical neural
529320	535960	models of the brain? And if it is, how does neuron firing represent 3D space? And this is quite a
535960	545000	difficult problem. And really, there are very few viable solutions to it. But I shall switch now,
545000	550200	I shall put that problem on one side and switch to the Projective Consciousness Model, PCM,
550200	555400	which has been developed by David and has collaborated since about 2017, and it's built on the
555400	560200	free energy principle. So it's based on a Bayesian model of local space in the brain.
560440	567080	And for its neural process model, it assumes the process model of the free energy principle.
567880	575640	And so the PCM assumes that the brain holds a 3D projective transform model of local Euclidean
575640	582040	space. And the key thing is that PCM then predicts that spatial consciousness is like
582040	587640	that model. And this is a very good prediction. It agrees very well with data. For instance,
587640	591640	the trivial fact that straight lines in your consciousness are straight lines in the real
591640	598920	world. So the PCM has a good Bayesian balance. I should say this is very distinctive amongst
598920	603640	many theories of consciousness. Very few of them talk about the spatial nature of consciousness.
603640	608200	And if they do, they probably treat it as a bit of an afterthought. But the PCM puts it
609240	614200	out in the front. And I think that's a very positive feature of it. And it has a good Bayesian
614200	619080	balance. And it does make various other predictions which people have talked about in the papers,
619800	624200	makes predictions about illusions of consciousness, and makes predictions about
624200	630520	predictive imagination and planning actions. Now, I don't think those are quite as significant
631080	636280	in the Bayesian balance in the agreement with the data as the basic agreement with the
636280	645240	form of consciousness right now. Consciousness from sense data. But I shall say the PCM has
645240	651560	three difficulties. I shall emphasize they're not difficulties of the PCM alone. I believe
651560	657000	they are difficulties of any neural theory of consciousness. And I'll just list them briefly
657000	661000	here because there's going to be a slide describing them. The first difficulty is neural
661000	666840	selection. How do we pick out just those neurons which cause consciousness from all the others that
666840	673000	don't? And the second one is neural precision and speed. We know that our conscious model of space
673000	678840	is a very detailed and precise one. Can you do that with neuron firing? I would suggest you can't.
679640	685160	And the third one is a complex decoding problem that, anyway, I'll come onto that.
685160	689640	So I'll describe these three in a minute. But the emphasis is that they are not just problems
689720	694920	of the PCM. They are difficulties for any neural theory of consciousness, for instance, IIT or
694920	702040	global neural workspace theory and so on. So what are the three difficulties? The neural
702040	706920	selection problem. Most neurons in the brain are not linked to consciousness. We know that from
706920	712600	cortical lesions, we don't interrupt consciousness, or the cerebellum, or Bjorn Merkur has written
712600	718040	quite extensively about this. But neuron theories of consciousness say that the activity of some
718040	723160	neurons causes consciousness and not others. So the question is how are those special neurons
723160	728920	selected? And as far as I know, there's no sound physical basis to pick out some neurons from
728920	734200	all the others. So you build in some selection assumptions into your hypothesis, but those
734200	740440	form a debit in your Bayesian balance. So they're a debit for any neural theory of consciousness.
741400	752120	The second difficulty is how do neurons represent space? Now, there are several possible ways of
752120	757720	having neurons representing 3D space. You can represent 2D space, all right? Can you return to
757720	763000	sharing the screen? Oh, sorry, I've lost sharing, have I? All good.
771400	789160	So how do neurons represent 3D space? There are several ways they might do it, but they all have
789160	795640	problems of precision and speed. For instance, there is a Bayesian computational model of how
795640	802040	animals build 3D internal model of space from their sense data. And this is already on one of the
802040	808360	AI live streams that this YouTube address. But that model shows that in order to build a 3D model
808360	815720	of space, even for a small animal like a bee, you need memory storage errors to be roughly the order
815720	822920	1% as small as that. Whereas if you model neurons accurately, properly, they don't give you this
822920	831800	precision because in a neuron, most theoretical models of neurons are ideal abstract neurons whose
831800	838600	outputs are real variables of high precision. And that's shown in the top of this picture here.
838600	844840	Whereas actually, neurons' outputs are spike trains, which in a short time scale gives very
844840	849720	limited precision. For instance, in a fifth of the second possible time scale for consciousness,
850680	857800	you may get about 10 pulses. And that gives you a precision of only 30% in that time scale.
857800	863560	So the precision you get from neural representations is very different from what you need to build
863560	869880	a decent 3D model or what we experience in consciousness. And this, I think, hasn't been
869880	874440	really spotted very much because most of the neural models that you see in the literature,
874440	878600	they don't model spike trains. It's different enough to model networks of neurons. And so
878840	885160	they use abstract, precise neurons. So that's the second difficulty. How can neurons store
885160	890760	precise and responsive, fast model of 3D space like the one we experience?
892200	900840	Finally, can you see that change? Third difficulty? The third difficulty is what I call the hard
900840	907560	triangle because conscious experience, which is C in this picture here, is a faithful, hardly
907560	913720	distorted model of the real world. There's the real world, A, and there's consciousness
913720	920840	awareness, C. But what the models we have found in the brain are two-dimensional models and very
920840	926680	distorted models. And so they're many different models, and they're highly complex encoding to
926680	934040	get from A to B. So if you want to get back from B to C, you have to do very complex decoding to
934040	941320	undo all the complex coding that most species brains do. And so ABC is the hard triangle.
942120	948120	You have to have complex decoding assumptions in any neural theory of consciousness. And the
948120	953800	worst thing of that maybe is that the decoding has to be species specific. It can't be universal
953800	962280	decoding. So those are the three difficulties for any neural theory of consciousness, including the
962280	971000	PCM, I believe. So that's where we've got to. I've covered topics one and two of this talk,
971000	974600	and now I think we'll break for any discussion or contributions.
979000	986200	Thank you very much, Robert, for your presentation up to now. I can follow it very well. I think
986840	993640	you point out very important issues. I should say, and perhaps we scan,
994360	1002920	that from the standpoint of the PCM, even though indeed we have framed it in the context of active
1002920	1009560	influence and more specifically the free energy principle, we do not necessarily
1010520	1020600	entail, it does not necessarily entail that we buy or we endorse or we believe in
1022440	1029320	the current neural network models that are used in this context. Personally, I've been a neuroscientist
1029320	1036360	for many years. I've done a lot of electrophysiology, lesion work with human patients. Also, I worked
1036360	1042040	with rodent. I've done a lot of functionally maging and modeling. At some point in my career,
1042040	1047240	I thought that I did not understand the brain well enough, and I stopped doing neuroscience. I stopped
1047240	1055160	carrying quote-unquote about the brain. For us, what is the most important in the PCM at this point
1055160	1061400	is all you said, is that we can capture some aspect of this phenomenology that seems essential,
1061480	1067160	et cetera, et cetera. Personally, I have given up at this point trying to
1069880	1079640	devise or figure out any realistic neural network models. When you take just one neuron,
1079640	1089080	as you said, Robert, it's a universe. You just think about how receptors are
1089320	1094760	or downregulated through fast gene expression or dendritic trees and their complexities
1094760	1103640	and their geometry plays a role in computation. I don't believe that the spiking of the neurons,
1103640	1108360	which we often call the output of the neuron, are necessarily where we should be looking at.
1109400	1116760	I don't know where we should be looking at. I committed an odd paper a long time ago in 2015,
1117560	1124120	in which I kind of said, well, I explained why I had given up hope at this point about brain
1124120	1128840	science to account for that, because I think we don't understand the brain. I think they are
1128840	1137560	principle we haven't figured out yet by far. My guess was that a bit like by analogy with
1137560	1143400	computer science, there are layers of abstraction, mechanism of virtualization that hide the detail
1143400	1150600	of the hardware, which we don't understand at all. And so far, it's a very open-ended thing.
1150600	1157160	So to me, what matters the most about the PCM at this point is with respect to the brain,
1157160	1162360	it is neutral. We don't know. At this point, I have absolutely no hypothesis, except very
1162360	1168760	gross anatomy of hypothesis, but also possible details about, but you're right,
1169320	1174360	that's the hard problem. And personally, I have given up on trying to account for it.
1176120	1183080	Thanks, David. I find so much to agree with there. And so, yeah, we don't understand what's going on
1183080	1188520	in the brain. Maybe neurons are doing something much more complicated than simple spike trains,
1188520	1195240	but maybe there's also this wave, and we'll talk about that. Carl, Ken, do you have any comments
1195240	1202920	on this thing? Carl, you want to go ahead? Or I can, if you don't mind, I'll just follow up with,
1203560	1213320	I completely agree with what David said. And I will say my own sort of approach to the problem has
1213320	1220120	always been sort of agnostic about the underlying realization. So I've kind of started from,
1220840	1227080	in my own thinking anyway, always from the point of view of phenomenology with some kind of,
1229160	1236840	you might say, general acceptance of some sort of physicalism, but agnostic about the details of
1236840	1244680	that physicalism. So agnostic about whether it's exactly what goes on in the brain or what level
1244680	1253080	and so on. I guess I've tended to, even though I agree you can't exclude it a priori, I've tended
1253080	1257720	to kind of think, well, quantum mechanical theories are probably barking up the wrong tree,
1258360	1265400	but that's just like my gut on that. And then I'm sorry, personally, Ken, at this point,
1265400	1269560	I'm so confused about the brain and about the physical nature of the universe that
1269960	1273320	I'm even totally open that the whole thing is quantum. I have no idea.
1273880	1280280	Okay. Yeah, as I said, it's just sort of like my gut on that, but not, I can't really defend it
1281640	1289400	in detail for a number of reasons, going to my own ignorance. But and I would just add that,
1289960	1297400	and I agree, I think the way you presented the PCM, generally was exactly right. You did mention
1297480	1306200	that we do have something to say about imagination, like action planning, and about anomalies and
1306200	1313400	illusions. And we, you know, we agree with you, I think that the main set of data we aim to capture
1313400	1321400	are the spatial component of consciousness and the perspectival spatial component, like,
1321400	1326440	you know, the project, what we use, projective geometry to capture. But then we do try to,
1326440	1335160	as you know, try to derive certain other bits of parts of the relevant data from that basis. So
1335160	1342040	accounting for illusions, like the moon illusion and the aims room illusion, and accounting for
1343880	1351560	imaginative action planning. And also, I should add some data about self awareness. So we have
1351640	1361080	paper on self awareness in this context as well. So, yeah, I think that's all I got so far. But
1361080	1367000	this is this has been very interesting so far. Thanks again. Come on.
1369720	1376280	How can I make any comments? No, I'm just enjoying this as a spectator,
1376840	1384200	batting for both sides. One comment, it seems to me that we're focusing on the distinction between
1385080	1393640	principles on about how the brain makes sense of its world and the process theories that attend
1393640	1400040	those principles in terms of instantiation. And there's an agnostic approach I think you can take
1400040	1408360	in relation to process theories. So I'm interested to see how much Robert's focus will be on the
1408360	1419720	process theory and the actual substrates, which I think is interesting from the point of view of
1420680	1430840	actually simulating this kind of inference and also being able to reproduce it in silico in
1430840	1439800	terms of creating a kind of artificial intelligence that has this kind of competence. So there may
1439800	1447400	be a more pragmatic focus. I was intrigued by the previous slide, this hard triangle.
1447800	1465640	Yeah, just go to it there. Yeah, I didn't quite resonate with this. I think for a start the
1465640	1473240	notions of encoding and decoding for people like me should be usefully unpacked. So everything in
1473240	1481800	terms of belief updating is some kind of mapping or morphism or relationship. So I'm assuming...
1481800	1490840	Mapping is a good word for it. Yeah. Okay, so the world generates sensory inputs and then the brain
1493320	1500840	represents those inputs. I mean, for B, you just imagine the visual cortex with a highly distorted
1501640	1507000	version of space in it, all around the fovea and so on, and all the other cortical maps,
1507000	1512440	a highly distorted representation of space. Somehow you have to tram all those back into
1512440	1517720	an undistorted representation. So you've got to decode the encoding that's gone on.
1521560	1528760	I see. Right, so the conscious awareness is still part of the brain somewhere.
1528760	1537400	But it must come from the brain somewhere, I think. Yes, we all. I see. So you're using encoding and
1537400	1548280	decoding in a sort of... Distorting, undistorting. It's like a distorting mirror, you've got to
1548280	1555240	undistort it. But I guess it relates to Karl's distinction between neural substrate and process
1555240	1562040	theory. Because indeed, if you look at the classical sort of quote-unquote 2D maps in the
1562040	1567880	cerebral cortex, for instance, the visual cortex with your retinotopy, where you see a lot of
1568600	1573800	deformation, but also somatosensory cortices, you think about the classical map of the body.
1575560	1581480	And you are saying, well, if that's the way it is kind of represented quote-unquote at the level of
1581480	1587320	that substrate, then since it is deformed and we don't experience it that way, we should somehow
1587320	1593080	have a process on top of that that use some morphism to transform this deformation.
1593080	1599320	I'm saying our theory of consciousness has to tell us how that unscrambling distortion happens.
1600520	1604520	Yeah, but I believe that the level of observation that we are considering here,
1604520	1608360	for instance, those 2D quote-unquote 2D, because they are not really 2D, but
1609320	1617400	cortical maps, retinotopic or somatotopic or topic maps are a very quote-unquote low level
1617400	1623880	of processing, which might be very far away from what is going on at the level of the process.
1623880	1627960	There might be some other super representation somewhere, but we've not found it yet.
1628920	1631640	Yeah, it might not be visible at the level of the anatomy.
1633400	1637160	Well, yeah, those are alternatives, I agree.
1637880	1641240	Okay, so sorry Carl, I interrupted, but I wanted to make this precision too.
1642280	1645320	Yeah, no, that clarifies it, thank you.
1647480	1652520	But Carl, I think we can all be agnostic about certain things in the process model.
1652520	1656040	I think you and I at least are not agnostic about basing into them.
1658440	1660840	Yeah, I would put the notion of
1661160	1670920	sentience of the kind we're talking about as a process of basing belief updating.
1670920	1677240	I put that at the sort of principle level, at the mechanics that doesn't commit to
1678920	1687720	an infrastructure or a realization or a process that realizes that kind of principle,
1687720	1696840	that kind of mechanics. So I think the spatial wave theory is really a commitment to a process
1696840	1704040	theory that could happily accommodate basing belief updating and its particular application,
1704040	1709560	the context of spatial perception and the projected consciousness model.
1709560	1717720	You're muted.
1723160	1723400	Oh, yes.
1739560	1758200	Okay, so moving on.
1761560	1766840	So we've done one and two, and what we're going to do in three is add something to the PCM.
1767400	1770200	And the thing we're going to add is not a little thing.
1770200	1776760	It's the assumption, the hypothesis that neurons don't do everything, but there is a wave in the
1776760	1780840	brain which stores 3D spatial information. So that's what I'm going to talk about next.
1782360	1786200	So here's the hypothesis. There is a wave in the brain that represents 3D space.
1787400	1793800	So it assumes there is some nearly spherical region of the brain with a diameter D and it
1793800	1800680	holds waves, which couples the neurons. And there the sphere is illustrated and a couple of waves,
1800680	1805640	wavelength lambda two, the green wave, and wavelength lambda one, a shorter wavelength,
1805640	1811800	that red wave. And those waves represent things in space. And they represent the red
1812760	1818360	thing R1 and the green thing R2. So there's an inverse relationship there. The shorter the
1818360	1823720	wavelength, the longer the distance to the thing that's being represented. But obviously,
1823720	1829960	if it's a spherical region, you can have waves in any direction. So you can represent any direction
1829960	1834440	and any distance up to a maximum, which is defined by the minimum wavelength.
1835800	1841320	So that wave can represent lots of different things. And the hypothesis is that that wave
1841320	1848200	acts as a working memory for space. It's really like a hologram. Now, one issue with that is
1848200	1854360	that if you want to represent objects at very large distances away, then you get into wavelengths
1854360	1861080	that's too short. So that's why you may need a projective transform of space to pull in those
1861080	1868600	long distances to be able to represent them on the wave. By the way, the evidence for this wave
1868600	1873800	is going to be described in another YouTube livestream, which we're making next week,
1873800	1881720	is going to get that address. So, well, there's a wave based spatial memory form.
1882840	1888760	It can represent approximately d of a lambda cubed independent positions, which is quite a lot.
1889320	1894920	And it can give you spatial precision for the order of lambda over d. And the point is that this
1894920	1900600	can easily be 1% or better, which is the precision you need. So there are significant benefits to
1900600	1906360	wave storage. It has high capacity. You can put many objects in it. It has a high precision.
1907080	1911960	It can be fast. And it has low spatial distortion. It is just like a hologram.
1915000	1922120	And it's a very simple and direct representation of space. So a spoiler looking at part four of
1922120	1928360	the talk is that this is very much like spatial consciousness. Question is there any evidence
1928360	1934120	for such a wave? I think there is evidence and there's three kinds of evidence. First two come
1934120	1939800	from brain anatomy, because there are spherical regions in the brain, which are very well suited
1939800	1945480	to hold this wave. In the mammals, there is a thalamus, and that's shown in green on the
1945480	1952520	left of the picture. And you see it's approximately spherical. And that is very suitably connected
1952520	1957160	for holding spatial information. It's connected to all the sense data, and it's connected to all
1957160	1963480	the bits of cortex that work out what to do with the sense data. And similarly, in the insect brain,
1963480	1969320	there is a central body in the very center of it. That is approximately spherical, and it's very
1969320	1977000	well preserved shape in all insect species. So those are both pieces of evidence for a wave in
1977000	1985640	the brain. There is a place for it. So I believe there are three lines of evidence for a wave.
1985640	1990840	One is the computational neuroscience, which I mentioned before, that spatial cognition is a
1990840	1997480	very important thing, but neural memory for it is too imprecise and too slow. Whereas a wave
1997480	2003000	storage model can possibly overcome these problems. So that's the yellow evidence, the evidence from
2003000	2009160	the insect central body that is nearly round, very central, very well connected. And there's evidence
2009160	2015880	from the mammalian thalamus. It's also round and well connected. But there's also what I call a
2015880	2020680	smoking gun for a wave in the thalamus that if you don't assume a wave, the anatomy of the
2020680	2026280	thalamus doesn't make sense. But I won't go into that in this talk. So together, I believe these
2026280	2032520	give quite strong support for the wave hypothesis. In fact, they give it a probability of 0.5
2032520	2038600	approximately, even if you try and weight the odds against it. As I say, you can see the
2038680	2043320	discussion of this in another YouTube live stream we're about to make. So
2045000	2048680	then that's on from part three to part four of talk.
2050840	2056440	Assume there is a wave in the brain, which holds the near-projective transform of 3D space. And
2056440	2062920	this wave is serving a very essential role to understand space to control all movements for
2062920	2068440	any animal. And the hypothesis simply is the wave is the origin of consciousness.
2069320	2073800	That neurons have nothing to do with consciousness at all. It comes entirely from the wave.
2074520	2080440	This solves three problems, the three problems that I outlined before. Firstly, the neural selection
2080440	2085320	problem, no selection problem, because neurons have nothing to do with consciousness. The precision
2085320	2090840	and speed problem, the wave has sufficient precision and speed to do it. And the decoding
2090840	2097560	problem, the coding in the wave is just a Fourier transform. So it's a very simple coding,
2098120	2102840	encoding, and it's a very simple decoding to give you back conscious experience.
2102840	2109560	So it has solved those three problems of neural theories. But the main thing is that spatial
2109560	2115240	like the PCM, preserving the merit of the PCM, the spatial form of consciousness
2115880	2121880	agrees very well with our conscious experience. It has to be projected because we need the
2121880	2128120	projection transform to pull in objects from very large distances to represent them by a minimum
2128120	2134600	wavelength. So in summary, the projective wave theory has a positive Bayesian balance,
2134600	2140520	doesn't have any Nazis about it, and it agrees very well with the main source of data about consciousness.
2141480	2147400	So just some aspects of this theory. What is the physical nature of the wave? A big objection
2147400	2153320	might be we've never seen the wave because I believe it's probably not an electromagnetic
2153320	2159960	wave or an electromagnetic field. And the main reason I believe that is that electromagnetic
2159960	2164600	fields on their own don't store information. For the time periods, we need to store information.
2165480	2169160	And now electromagnetic fields might be part of the answer, but I think they're not the whole
2170120	2175800	answer. And the big question then is why have we not detected this wave in the brain? It's been
2175800	2182360	there all these years. I think the reason for that is if there is a wave representing space,
2182920	2188280	we will expect it to evolve to have very low intensity. So its energy consumption is very
2188280	2193720	small. And having that low intensity, we simply haven't known how to look for it.
2194440	2200200	Now, coming to quantum possibilities, the wave might be a coherent quantum
2200200	2206040	excitation. And there's increasing evidence that quantum effects do have a role in biology.
2206760	2213800	And it might even be a Bose-Einstein condensate, a BEC. Now those examples of those are superconductors
2213800	2219640	and superfluids, they're very rash state in nature. But the key thing about a BEC is
2219640	2225560	a superconductor can hold information for unlimited time. So it would be good for memory.
2226200	2232920	And they're a very rare and distinctive state of matter. And so if you assume that consciousness
2232920	2239640	comes from them, you don't get to a trough of panpsychism. Or it might not be a quantum effect,
2239640	2244680	because I think that this question is entirely open. So we'll set that on one side and that's
2244760	2251640	future exploration. There is an issue about the evolution of consciousness. We know that
2251640	2256200	consciousness is, our consciousness is like the real world. It's very like the real world.
2256920	2261960	And the question is why is this? And you think, well, it must have evolved that way because
2261960	2266600	some need for it to be like the real world. But in neural theories, there's a problem.
2267240	2273160	Because neural computation in the brain, the classical neural model, is classical dynamics,
2273160	2279240	not quantum physics, and is local. And so consciousness is a non physical, non local
2279240	2286200	effect, and they don't have any effect on neurons firing. So the result is that consciousness in
2286200	2293000	a neural theory has no causal effect on fitness. That means there's no selection pressure on it
2293000	2298520	to make it the way it is. So in a neural theory of consciousness, we're driven to this slightly
2298520	2302920	awkward conclusion that the special form of consciousness that we have is just a bit of
2302920	2308600	an accident. That seems very unlikely. Whereas in the projective wave theory,
2308600	2313320	there is a good evolutionary reason for consciousness being like it is. That is that
2313320	2320200	3D spatial cognition is very important. Wave is an essential part of it. So the wave has been
2320200	2325240	shaped by evolution. And it's been shaped to be just like the real world, because that's the best
2325240	2331640	way of controlling. So consciousness then is determined by the wave. And that means consciousness
2331640	2337080	has evolved to be like that. So the wave theory solves another problem there.
2338760	2344200	Finally, the unity of consciousness. You may ask this question occasionally, why do I only have
2344200	2349720	one consciousness and not several parallel consciousnesses? And this also is something
2349720	2354360	with difficulty neural theories, because we have plenty of neurons in the brain to have many
2354360	2360600	parallel consciousnesses. And brains can do some things in massive parallelism. And if we had
2360600	2365640	multiple parallel consciousness, it might be useful, for instance, for parallel planning of
2365640	2372040	action to see which one works. That's a difficulty for neural theories. The wave theory doesn't
2372040	2376840	have this difficulty because it accounts for the unity of consciousness. There's only one wave in
2376840	2381480	the brain. That is the source of consciousness. So there can only be one consciousness.
2382120	2391560	I think I'm on to the last slide now, pretty much the last slide. If this theory is taken
2391560	2396040	serious, it makes consciousness into a scientific problem rather than a philosophical problem.
2396920	2402120	Because a wave in the brain, if a wave in the brain is the key to understanding consciousness,
2402120	2407480	well, if there's no wave, then this theory is wrong. Get about it. If there is a wave,
2407480	2412920	I think there are very strong reasons to link it to consciousness, because it has such a good fit
2412920	2418520	to consciousness. So whether or not the wave exists, that's a scientific question. It's not a
2418520	2423560	question for philosophy. And I think there's a good prospect of answering it in the next 10 years.
2423560	2428120	So in 10 years time, either this theory will be the only theory of consciousness,
2428120	2431480	or it will be wrong and forgotten. I think that's a virtue and a theory.
2432120	2442200	So finally, last slide on the hard problem, David Chalmers' hard problem. The
2442200	2448360	predicted wave theory doesn't solve that problem. What I'd say about that is all
2448360	2452440	science has hard problems. There is the hard problem of consciousness. Why is consciousness
2452440	2458040	and link to matter? There are hard problems in physics, like what is space-time, or what is the
2458040	2464600	most fundamental particle? Or the hard problem of cosmology, why is there a universe? So hard
2464600	2471160	problems just don't have an answer. Scientists will like children keeping asking why, say why this,
2471160	2477160	why that. And we can go on asking why for as long as we like. So for instance, for fundamental
2477160	2481720	particles, we thought there was matter, we thought there were atoms, we got to protons,
2481720	2486760	we got to quarks, and we keep going on and we'll never get the final answer. But we still do science.
2486760	2495720	So I'm not too worried about the hard problem, consciousness. So that is all, and I've just
2495720	2499880	laid out a few questions or might want to discuss in the remaining time.
2502760	2506840	Maybe you could share your slide again so we can see the question if you have them on the slide.
2508360	2513880	Sorry, is it not sharing now? I see the slide still. Yeah, so you can leave it, maybe check
2513880	2519320	your view, David. And then you can leave that up and we can have a panel discussion.
2523480	2531880	Well, thanks a lot. Those who are here can, and Carl and David, please feel free to comment.
2533160	2538520	And also people will write some questions in the chat and I'll read one in if you pause. But
2538520	2543320	anyone here who'd like to give a reflection or any comments, that would be awesome.
2544840	2553960	Could I go ahead? Can you hear me? So if I may, I basically agree with what you say about the
2553960	2558280	hard problem, just to take the very last thing that you mentioned about the hard problem. And
2558280	2564760	this is why earlier on when you said that you had kind of a list of sort of, you know,
2565400	2571240	the idea of the Bayesian balance for theories of consciousness, and you mentioned the existence
2571240	2579960	of consciousness as itself, something that might be a problem for all neuronal theories of consciousness.
2579960	2585960	I think you did that on the slide too. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, so I agree. I think it's a problem for any
2585960	2593240	theory of consciousness, even the kind of more metaphysical theories that people who reflect
2593240	2598120	like Chalmers and others, panpsychists who reflect on the hard problem a certain way
2598680	2605480	end up with, you can actually raise the same set of questions for them. So there's really no progress
2605480	2611240	there, in my opinion. So in other words, if you take the hard problem as a kind of indication
2611960	2619000	that, well, consciousness couldn't be physical, or, or either that, or the physical world itself
2619000	2624440	must just be consciousness, which is kind of the two directions they go there. I think that's kind
2624520	2632920	of misguided. I mean, we, we have to sort of accept that our ability to penetrate, you know,
2632920	2642200	cognitively, a priori into the nature of the cosmos is, is limited. So our, the best we can do is
2642200	2649560	make models and, you know, based on the phenomenology and try to arrive at a model that would give us
2650440	2659960	some kind of neural or physical, to speak more broadly, physical, testable, you know,
2659960	2664680	hypothesis, hypotheses we can test about the physical world, what we think realizes consciousness.
2664680	2670760	And it seems to me like that's exactly what you're doing. And that's what I would think is, is right
2670760	2681480	too. But I did want to ask you, when you say that no neurons are linked to consciousness in your own
2681480	2689640	model, do you mean, maybe I just don't understand exactly, but they're not linked directly to
2689640	2696200	consciousness. Okay. But there's some involved in the realization of the wave. Is that Oh,
2696200	2700920	they are absolutely, they're controlling the wave, they're setting up the wave. They're all
2700920	2706440	on the cortex, they're using sense data to, to fix the wave. And it's the wave that makes consciousness.
2707560	2716680	Okay. And on the issue of unity, well, so suppose we identify this type of wave. I mean, it's at
2716680	2723560	least, you know, conceivable that we would find multiple such waves. Would you can see
2723640	2727480	well, I think the evidence in the thalamus and the central body is one way.
2728680	2733000	Okay. And I think one way is what you need to understand one space around you.
2735080	2744600	Okay. So, but if you found multiple such waves, would you be an issue? Yeah, okay. Well, I mean,
2744600	2750440	would you conclude that there must be multiple consciousnesses, then in a single brain? Or
2750520	2755640	would you, would you think that the theory is wrong? No, I would have a selection problem,
2755640	2760120	just like neuron theories have a selection problem, selecting neurons. I'd have a problem
2760120	2767560	selecting which wave is conscious. I see. Rather than conclude that there are multiple.
2769320	2773640	You want to avoid that. My experience is I don't have multiple consciousnesses. Yes.
2775960	2779720	Right. But that might just be because only one of them gets to report.
2780920	2786280	Yeah, absolutely. No, like, like the way they, you know, I know it's debatable, but the way they
2788440	2795480	often interpreted the split brain cases coming out of. Yeah, good question. Good question. I mean,
2795480	2801560	I say one wave, but we have two thalamus. So the assumption there is that those waves are linked
2801560	2808920	and perhaps in split brain, they don't get linked. Okay. I think two thalamus have one wave in them,
2809160	2815400	that's a detail. I see. And then when it comes to the kind of wave, like,
2816840	2823560	so you don't think it's an electromagnetic wave, you think it might be a Bose-Einstein
2823560	2829480	condensate. That's a hypothesis, I think, that Karen Smith once flowed. It's been around for some
2829480	2835880	years. Yeah. Alexander Karen Smith in the book. That's the, yeah, not the book on the origin,
2835880	2841160	the famous book on the origin of life, but he wrote a book on consciousness back in the 90s,
2841160	2847240	I think. Yeah, there was Michael Lockwood as well in the 80s, I think. It's a long history.
2847880	2855080	Okay. So how, when you say that you think we'll be able to probe this within the next 10 years,
2855080	2862040	I mean, could you sort of sketch how that might go, how we might be able to. Yeah. I mean, just,
2862040	2867400	this is not, this is probing the idea of the wave. Right. As I say, I think there are those three
2867400	2872680	pieces of, there's neural models that you can't build decent neural models. There is the thalamus
2873320	2878200	and there is the insect central body. I think we can go further on each one of those. We can test
2878200	2883720	them. We can test the thalamus ideas much better using connectome data. We can test the central
2883720	2889080	body using connectome data. And we can test the computational models by just trying to build them
2889080	2895960	and see if we get in. So there is science to be done to falsify this hypothesis and it may
2895960	2906600	succeed in falsifying it. Okay. But how would you measure such condensate? I mean, if you want to
2906600	2912520	be able to demonstrate the existence of the problem. Ideally, you'd like to actually directly
2912600	2919560	detect it. I think it's a bit like when Pauli in the 1930s predicted the neutrino. He thought it's
2919560	2924840	absolutely impossible to detect neutrinos. And it took 25 years to find it. And I think it'll take
2924840	2930200	a long time to really find this wave in the brain, because it's very low intensity, probably,
2930200	2933960	and because we just don't know how to look for it. And I think we have to do the biophysics
2933960	2939400	until we have a convincing case for eyes, this kind of wave, and then we can build a detector.
2939400	2944840	But until then, I think we won't detect it like neutrino or like dark matter.
2944840	2948760	Similar thing predicted theoretically years ago, but still not detected.
2953800	2955640	I'll read a question from the live chat.
2956440	2969720	Okay. Andrea Val wrote, thanks for sharing such interesting ideas. I wonder how the
2969720	2976440	PCM or 3D model can explain or deal with the un slash consciousness of emotions.
2977880	2982600	So where is affectant such in this kind of spatialized model?
2983560	2986200	Yeah. So maybe you want to join the PCM first, David?
2988040	2996680	If it's okay, Robert, maybe you have read some recent work on that, but I have a specific
2997400	3000840	answer to that question. Yeah, you go first.
3001560	3007720	Yeah, sorry about that. Well, one of the things that we realized working with that
3007720	3014680	particular geometry is it transform information in the sense of information in space. You can
3014680	3019080	think about distribution in space, for instance, that are going to be changed by projective
3019080	3025560	transformation in a manner that affect directly entropy. So if something is very far,
3026120	3029160	you know, and you have some uncertainty about the localization of these things,
3029160	3034840	so there is a probability function that represent that uncertainty about the localization
3034920	3040360	of that thing. And there is only one thing in your field of consciousness to simplify the problem.
3041400	3047720	Then the entropy of the whole space, if you consider the whole 3D space and some
3047720	3057240	scalar on it that would represent probabilities is very small. Whereas when you get closer,
3058120	3062440	for instance, by imagination, the projective transformation that anticipates action,
3063160	3067800	you get the object closer and you transform also the information, the variance, if you wish,
3067800	3072840	of your distribution, so it becomes broader. So the entropy increase, actually,
3072840	3077320	as an effect of projective transformation on the distribution of information.
3077320	3086520	So how does that relate to emotion? What we realized is that it can account for some
3086600	3092680	drives that are related to exploration or exploratory behavior or search behavior
3093240	3101320	to reduce uncertainty or maximize information. And that just does that. So basically,
3101320	3109480	the projective transformation by in virtue of making probabilities function in space
3109720	3117960	change their shape as a function of perspective taking, if you wish, until or induce a drive
3118600	3127080	to approach or avoid things or in this context to approach behavior either through imagination
3127080	3133400	or through actual behavior because that will maximize information by increasing entropy
3133400	3137880	of the object and you have more details. So that's something that we wrote a paper that is
3137880	3144600	currently under review in biological cybernetics about that with Gregor Sergent-Pertu as first
3144600	3151080	author with a bright mathematician and we can do a demonstration and actually direct theorems about
3151080	3157240	that and also simulations that show interesting behaviors that depend on projective parameters
3157240	3162520	that will show that the behavior of the agent, depending on the parameter, will be more focused.
3162520	3167640	So they will tend to always approach one object because they are driven by this anticipation
3167640	3174600	of increasing information through projective transformation. But with other parameters or
3174600	3178760	values of the parameters on the contrary, they start now oscillating between objects.
3178760	3185400	They start losing focus as if they were kind of ADHD. So there is a deep link between let's say
3186760	3195080	the evaluation of space, the appraisal of space, the drives that are that unfold from this information
3195080	3202520	and the behaviors that you have, for instance, approaching and that geometry, that very geometry
3202520	3207480	we are talking about yield, that type of thing. So here we are talking about what is typically
3207480	3214200	described as epistemic emotion, basically curiosity. So we have natural curiosity and part of it
3214200	3221000	that drives behaviors is a result of the very geometry that represents information and appraisal
3221000	3225800	according to that theory. I cannot enter into the detail on that, but you can also look on
3226680	3234120	papers that we wrote in what was that 2022 in the Journal of Theoretical Biology in which we use
3234120	3241400	little robots to demonstrate adaptive and maladaptive behaviors with principles also derived
3241400	3248680	from the geometry and the free energy principle or something equivalent to get a wealth of
3249640	3257560	affective behavior of approach avoidance, but also social cognition. We can kind of
3257560	3265960	simulate social anxiety. We obtain joint attention behavior as a result of mutual perspective taking
3266840	3273000	and there are a lot of things we could account that we can use in this model and in this framework
3273000	3277960	to account for emotion. There is a lot of work ahead, but we believe that there is and we have
3277960	3282920	good reason to believe there is a deep link between space and emotion that's actually called
3282920	3289560	aesthetics that consciousness is a form of aesthetics where space and emotion are untangled
3289560	3296440	and that we can fairly well account for many phenomena that relate to emotion and behavior
3297080	3300200	through this model, but that's sorry for the long talk.
3301160	3307400	That's great. Shall I give my final answer? It's very much along the same lines that
3307960	3317560	emotion and space are deeply linked. In the wave model, I mean the model of space contains all
3317560	3323880	of space, the external space and the internal space of the body and an important part of emotions is
3324600	3328600	feelings in the body and they are part of your conscious awareness, part of the
3329960	3337560	wave model or projection model just like the others. Basically, the PW theory and I think the
3337560	3345480	PCM says all consciousness is spatial. We have qualia, but they exist in space. You hear words,
3345480	3349800	you experience colors, you experience all of those and you experience feelings,
3349800	3355400	all of them in space. If you look at all the components of emotion, human emotion for instance,
3355400	3361320	the words we say to ourselves and the feelings we have in our bodies, they are all represented in
3362600	3369320	that conscious space. Human emotion is a complex story which perhaps we don't want to go into,
3369320	3373640	but basically it comes down to the way we experience it is in that model of space.
3374280	3383560	And if I may, I would have that if you take the standpoint of pure phenomenology and you ask yourself
3383560	3389080	when I experience an emotion, for instance deep anxiety or fear, something very intense that is
3389080	3395960	very salient, you can ask yourself how much of that phenomenology of that experience is actually
3396520	3403240	quote-unquote reducible to some spatial experience. For instance, the experience of the body with the
3403240	3409080	heart that starts pounding in your chest and you feel it stronger, your lungs that change,
3409960	3414920	you breathe faster for instance and you can feel that movement in your body and all of that is
3414920	3419880	spatial. What you feel in your gut or your intestine gets kind of stretched or whatever,
3420520	3426120	we have metaphors, but actually a lot of the details of the phenomenology of emotion or feelings,
3426120	3433080	let's say, I believe is actually spatial, but it's overlooked. People don't think about it.
3433240	3438520	But in particular, about body awareness, there is a lot of spatial stuff going on here.
3439400	3446680	Yeah, I agree. Mindful meditation, talk a lot about space and talk a lot about the body.
3446680	3449000	I think they put emotion in the right place.
3449000	3461560	Carl or Ken, want to add anything or I can look for another question in the live chat.
3469080	3477640	Well, I have one question. So I mean, your current hypothesis is that this wave is
3477640	3484600	realized in the thalamus. Is that right? That's right. Yeah. Okay. So that's sort of
3487240	3492520	would, you know, there's this kind of debate about whether or not consciousness is cortical
3493640	3499800	or subcortical. So this would definitely be on the subcortical side. I think there's a lot of
3499800	3504040	sense in the global workspace theory and they were talking originally about a workspace involving
3504040	3509880	the thalamus and the cortex. I think it's the consciousness really comes from the thalamus
3509880	3518040	integrating all that spatial information. So it is down. So the follow up, but yeah, that's fine
3518040	3524040	with me, frankly. But the follow up question is, well, it's not exactly a follow up to that. It's
3524040	3530600	more a general question about your way of thinking about it. How, I mean, I know maybe you can't
3530600	3536680	really answer this until we have a more specific hypothesis about exactly what kind of wave it is,
3536680	3545640	but could you say something generally about how the wave integrates with or what's the right way
3545640	3553320	to put it, use it, recruits and, you know, the kind of computational apparatus of the brain
3553320	3559640	so that, you know, you end up, you decide to, oh, I'm going to reach out, you know,
3559640	3568200	yay far and grab this bottle. How does the, how does, you know, computationally speaking,
3568200	3574120	how does the wave integrate? Yeah, I think that's a very good question and could have a very long
3574120	3581320	answer. But basically, the wave integrates information from all the sense data. So from
3581320	3587480	your hands, from your ears, from your eyes, all that information goes through the cortex and cortex
3587480	3594440	decides where it's coming from and broadcast signals back to the thalamus and the thalamus wave
3594440	3599320	integrates all those signals together to produce the Bayesian best model of what's happening at
3599320	3607000	this moment based on touch, proprioception, hearing, sound, hearing, vision and so on. So the
3607000	3613800	computation, it's an integration of many sorts of information, possibly in a cycle between the
3613800	3624760	thalamus and the cortex. Okay, but if you need to, you know, for example, program and action,
3625480	3631320	so you've, that's kind of the, you got your sensory, the integration of all your sensory
3631400	3636920	information, now you need to program and action. How do, and maybe this is just my ignorance,
3636920	3645000	how do waves, how can waves be used in a way to generate programming of an action and then give
3645000	3650600	it back to your neurons? I mean, I've only got beginnings of answers to that. But basically,
3650600	3656120	wave is very good for representing 3D geometry and for calculating displacements. I know where
3656120	3661240	my hand is, I know where my coffee cup is, so the wave helps me calculate the displacement,
3661240	3665960	which way I have to move my hand to pick up the coffee cup. So it's that kind of spatial
3665960	3669560	calculation that the wave is always helping us do, just to move our limbs.
3675400	3679400	I have a follow-up question on that, if I may. Ken, do you mind?
3679400	3680920	Yeah, no, go ahead, go ahead.
3681560	3687640	You invoked earlier Fourier transform and inverse Fourier transform, so at least 3D Fourier transform
3687640	3692920	and inverse Fourier transform, in order to do the encoding and decoding to, you know,
3692920	3699720	go move from the wave to the neural substrates back and forth. Of course, as you know,
3701000	3709400	there is a limit in resolution. When you do a Fourier transform, you have the uncertainty
3709400	3717640	principle that rules the initial resolution that we can have. Of course, it depends on the
3717640	3723080	number of samples. I mean, there are a lot of arithmetics behind it. It can be more and more
3723080	3732680	precise as you have more and more bits of encoding, if you wish. So you said that classical
3732680	3741960	neural theories like build upon substrates that lack enough precision in spatial resolution,
3741960	3748200	for instance, to account for our experience. Would you think that in the context of a wave theory,
3748200	3755000	the type of uncertainty principle that are attached to it, could cause a problem of resolution too,
3755000	3760920	or that it's the granularity? There is a problem, yeah. There is a problem of resolution.
3760920	3765560	I alluded to it in the slides. That is that if you've got a minimum wavelength lambda
3766120	3771960	and a diameter of the sphere D, the maximum precision is lambda over D, and that can't
3771960	3778040	be infinite precision. So that's the uncertainty principle. But the idea of the Fourier transform
3778040	3783960	is not that something in the brain does a Fourier transform. It is the fundamental bridging law for
3783960	3789720	consciousness does the Fourier transform. It says that consciousness is a Fourier transform of the
3789720	3797400	wave, full stop. Fourier transform is there in fundamental laws of nature, like quantum mechanics,
3797400	3802440	for instance. So it's saying this is a fundamental law of nature, just like quantum mechanics says
3802440	3809880	momentum is a Fourier transform position. So the bridging law for consciousness says
3810680	3813800	the form of consciousness is a Fourier transform of the wave.
3813800	3823960	I'll make a short comment, or Carl, do you want to?
3828520	3835320	After you. Okay. So thank you for the presentation, and it's really interesting on many levels.
3835320	3841160	First, you and the paper goes into more detail on this. You lay out what your priors are,
3841240	3847640	and kind of the dependency structure to actually reach at least an estimate of probabilities,
3847640	3851480	which is it's really interesting. It gives a lot of opportunities for people to dig in
3852120	3856200	and say, yeah, I think that's 10% likely or no, it's a zero. This is not possible and kind of
3856200	3864280	close off a branch of inquiry. And also this discussion here about the algorithmic and the
3864280	3871400	substrate realization interaction with the substrate, and even this poly computation idea of
3871400	3876520	the observer's model of what's happening in a process, and kind of like the dark matter there,
3876520	3881400	like the observer might suggest that there's a cryptographic process, though they couldn't
3881400	3886840	decode it. And then that would have an entropy distribution that wouldn't be distinguishable
3886840	3893000	in the absence of the decryption from a noise, but it would be like still a hypothesis kept alive.
3893000	3899560	And you could say, I think it's a 1% chance of this being the case. One thought is how
3899560	3908120	high precision really is the spatial generative model in that there could be visual upscaling?
3908920	3914840	We know there's attention play to make the periphery look sharp and have color vision.
3915560	3921320	And so it's possible that especially for like distant objects, small objects that they could be
3921960	3929560	bundled and just seen as a assembly, as a larger object, if they're touching like the car body
3929560	3937800	and the wheel, and then the same way that in the periphery, color and visual attention seem to give
3937800	3944120	this extreme like, wow, that's like exactly this angle. If you were to go over there with a protractor,
3944120	3949560	but that could be as we're sort of seeing with diffusion and generative AI models,
3949560	3959240	that could be quite a low resolution structural inference followed by a just compatible visual
3960280	3968360	realization. And then just last comment, really interesting to explore, how does evolution
3968360	3975320	and intergenerational change shape the substrate that the sense data wash over so that non-stationary
3975400	3981000	stable states, whether they're rate encoding of neuron, whether glial, electro,
3982120	3987480	and all these other even potentially more exotic options, how are those stabilized?
3989320	3996520	Wow. I mean, those are real questions to investigate, particularly the precision of our
3996520	4002680	conscious experience and how much is quotes and illusion. But I personally think that if you look
4002760	4007720	at something which is a straight line, you experience it as a straight line with some kind
4007720	4014920	of precision that's of the order of 1%, a deviation of 1% from a straight line would show. And so
4014920	4023160	that's a lower bound on the precision of your model. But again, there can be lots of discussion
4023240	4034200	about this. Yeah, interesting. Karl, any thoughts?
4035880	4046200	Well, just a few sort of practical and specific questions. So the nature of this wave, if I wanted
4046200	4051160	to model it, I mean, are we talking about a standing wave? Are we talking about a soliton?
4051240	4057800	Are we talking about spherical harmonics on the surface of the thalamus? Are we talking about
4059480	4067160	what kind of basis might I use for this kind of wave, even before asking questions about what
4067160	4072440	the wave amplitude actually means? So what's the functional mathematical form of this way?
4074760	4079560	Very good questions, whether it's a standing wave or a moving wave. I don't know. The nice
4079560	4087720	thing about a Bose-Einstein condensate is that it acts like a long-lived quantum mechanical
4087720	4095560	wave function. In other words, it has phase which can be detected, and it preserves phase for long
4095560	4101960	times. And the wave might have to preserve phase in order to represent positions. If you have a
4101960	4107720	standing wave like cos theta in some direction in this sphere, then there's an ambiguity. It
4107720	4113320	represents plus a direction and the minus direction and what happens to the minus direction. So
4113960	4118840	I would rather have phase in the wave like a Bose-Einstein condensate, but they're very
4118840	4123400	deep questions and I don't do the answers. I mean, we could start modelling and see what happens.
4124280	4132520	Just propose some answers. Basically, you just need a spherical volume that holds a wave
4132520	4140120	excitation with a certain maximum wave vector, and we could try out standing waves, moving waves,
4140120	4153400	and so on. What would differentiate a condensate from a formulation in terms of a time-dependent
4153480	4162200	floating wave equation? Well, I think your time-dependent floating wave, as everybody knows,
4162200	4168360	the problem with quantum in the brain is that decoherence smashes it in 10 to the minus 20 seconds,
4168360	4173640	but that doesn't happen to a Bose-Einstein condensate. A Bose-Einstein condensate is a long-lived quantum
4173640	4181960	state, and so that's an ordinary floating equation. Decoherence is going to smash you in no time at
4181960	4186600	all unless you have some incredibly clever insulation like in a quantum computer.
4189000	4195960	Right. I mean, lifting from the microscopic to the macroscopic, I mean, that would suggest
4195960	4202680	that you need very, very low temperatures thermodynamically speaking. No one has observed
4202680	4208760	a BC at room temperature yet, but we've got close, and the idea is that nature might be cleverer than
4208760	4218600	we are. One angle, perhaps from the quantum FEP from Carl and Chris Fields and others is,
4218600	4226760	and what I heard in the basis set question, Carl, was this brain region that hosts the
4226760	4235000	functionality or the core aspect of the functionality, like one option is it is like the wave is
4235000	4242040	represented inside of that sphere. Like just, there's probably multiple ways even that could
4242040	4247720	happen, but it's like a little reconstruction wave, but symbolized. Another option would be,
4247720	4254760	like a holograph, the representation space is encoded on the interface of that region with
4254760	4264040	other regions, and so that kind of surface is maintained and stabilized and has information
4264040	4269960	flowing through it. And then there wouldn't necessarily be something in the middle, but it'd
4269960	4277160	be more like a ripple on a surface, which was the basis set question. Daniel, that is very
4277160	4283480	interesting because in the thalamus, there is the thalamic reticular nucleus, TRN, which is a thin
4283480	4289160	skin around the surface of the thalamus. And you could just say that is holding the surface wave.
4289960	4293880	And the wave is projected inside from the surface.
4297080	4306440	It would be useful to engage Chris Fields here. There are two very distinct uses of the word
4306440	4314120	holographic here. You could be referring to the holographic principle, whereby all the information
4314120	4322920	on the bulk, on the inside, say, of the thalamus was on the surface, on the reticular nucleus
4322920	4331640	of the thalamus, for example, or just on the surface in one sense. And that is what the rest
4331640	4339800	of the brain sees and possibly consciousness sees. But that's a very different use of the notion of
4340600	4347880	a holographic projection using constructive and destructive interference to encode things.
4348840	4355480	So Daniel, you're absolutely right. My question was really searching to distinguish,
4355480	4363320	are we talking about a wave function in the thalamus? Are we talking about
4364200	4371640	application of the holographic principle to the classical information on the surface
4372760	4380680	of some bulk that was the thalamus? And you could then argue, if you wanted to, that the bulk,
4380680	4384920	which can never be observed from the outside, unless you are the thalamus, you never know what's
4384920	4392920	happening on the inside. You could only observe what's on the surface. That would be a different
4393720	4401960	notion of a wave theory that would certainly be consistent with quantum information theory
4401960	4409480	and also consistent with Chris Fields in a screen hypothesis that could be
4409480	4419080	spatialized and endowed with, in virtue of the fact that on the holographic screen itself,
4419400	4425160	on the surface, there can only be classical information and that information can now be
4426040	4434440	cast in terms of classical Bayesian inference. But it also relates to, I repeat to Chris Fields,
4434440	4441960	in a screen hypothesis, which is, if you like, taking quantum information,
4441960	4449240	theoretic principles and trying to apply them to consciousness, that eludes the problem of
4452760	4460760	applying quantum mechanics that is only relevant at the very small scale, for very precise or
4460760	4470280	low temperature systems. If you want to apply that kind of maths to macroscopic phenomena,
4470360	4475160	then you have to apply it in a scale invariant context and I think quantum information theory
4475160	4479320	would certainly do that. So, Daniel, yes, I was exactly trying to probe.
4482680	4496520	Is PW red? The Bose-Einstein condensate variant or alternative version of the projective wave
4497480	4510920	is that committed to quantum mechanics or is it really an expression of condensate-like dynamics
4510920	4518120	in the context of quantum information theory? And if it is, does it live on a holographic screen
4518120	4523240	or does it live in the bulk? And if it lives in the bulk, what are these wave functions over?
4523240	4526360	So, these are the practical questions I was trying to get out.
4527560	4533240	Very interesting questions and it's all to play for. I have an open mind about them, but
4534680	4540760	my feeling is that the BEC is a way of getting past this decoherence argument from
4541560	4551960	Tickmark others that neurons have to be classical. And the BEC, it does work very well as a memory.
4552440	4557640	That's the practical point of it. Working memory, I think, is what you need for space.
4560280	4568600	Awesome. Perhaps each can give a last round of thought. Where do they feel this takes them
4568600	4575880	or what are they looking forward to and can then David and then Carl and then Robert?
4576600	4584200	Yeah, I don't have anything new to add. I find this really interesting and I remember
4585240	4592360	reading Karen Smith's book kind of arguing that Bose-Einstein condensates might be
4594120	4599480	important for understanding consciousness and thinking that among the quantum mechanical
4599480	4610280	hypotheses, I like that one the best. I said earlier, I just sort of have this kind of bias,
4610280	4619000	but I'm totally willing to be talked out of it. I don't want to go into the details, but
4620040	4627560	I think Karen Smith's concern was about the unity of consciousness primarily and also kind of made
4627560	4637960	the case that as you were suggesting that maybe as you put it, nature is cleverer than we are
4637960	4644920	and there's some way to realize that Bose-Einstein condenses it in the brain without the decoherence
4644920	4654280	issue. But anyway, just to say this is all very, very fascinating to me and I am happy to continue
4654280	4666120	the discussion next week, right? Isn't it next week? Thank you, Ken. And from my part, yes,
4666120	4674040	I'm also looking forward to continuations of the discussion. My direction of questioning
4674040	4680120	will be something on the lines that I think both Karen and David alluded to which is the
4681080	4691880	the link between spatial waves in the brain and the projective geometry that they speak to
4691880	4699480	and the information geometry that underwrites belief updating and the Bayesian mechanics that
4700440	4706120	inherit from the free energy principle, being it classical mechanics, the classical information
4706120	4717080	processing or looking at using quantum information theory to read belief updating.
4717080	4722520	I'm not sure I'm going to get any answers, but that's what I'm interested in hearing more about
4722520	4726200	and the process. If you haven't talked about mortal computation yet, so we need to talk about
4726200	4734360	mortal computation. Oh, yes. David, any last thoughts? Well, the thought of a
4736360	4742680	of a man who is 15 now and feels that the more he learns, the less he knows. So it was predicted
4742680	4750920	in all the books I had read in my years. And so I'm whole opened to that complex universe. I certainly
4750920	4758040	believe that nature is clever than I am for sure. And I find that fascinating. I like the rationale.
4758040	4762520	It's not like, you know, there is a lot of stuff about quantum mechanics and the brain
4762520	4767240	and consciousness that to me has always sounded wishy-washy, if not completely wacko.
4768920	4776120	But I came back a bit from that. I had a lot of like Ken priors, negative priors about it.
4776840	4783080	I remember once in Tucson, Arizona, at the famous conference about the science of consciousness,
4783080	4787400	there were this bunch of guys who called themselves, they were German, the quantum
4787400	4791880	consciousness Academy, and they were all dressed in black and they are all, you know, headset and
4791880	4797480	microphone like that. And they were like speaking nonsense as like a cult. But I found that very
4797480	4803400	fascinated because I used to like very fascinating. So I used to like this conference back in the day
4803400	4808680	when it was very psychedelic. But that was kind of, you know, and I come back to that because
4808680	4815720	my ignorance, I'm becoming aware more and more of my own ignorance. I say, well, why not? And
4815720	4821480	definitely I think that maybe Carl can try to do that. If we could get Chris Field in the next
4821480	4827400	core role, he would certainly be among us, the most competent. I tried to get Grégoire Sergent
4828360	4833960	to the core, but he was not available. He's a very bright mathematician and he master quantum
4833960	4839960	mechanics like, like if it was, you know, I don't know, it's nothing for him. Or Daniel Benka would
4839960	4844520	be the best also is Grégoire. But I'm afraid I won't be able to have them here. But I think it
4844520	4849320	would be very useful to have some people like that who definitely know more than me about those
4849320	4854840	things. And Chris might be interested to join. I don't know, Carl. But looking forward to the next
4855400	4862920	to the next discussion, one correction, they were Swiss, David, they weren't, they weren't, they
4862920	4871880	weren't, they were Swiss, they were Swiss black, I think. Yes, they kind of look like people from
4871880	4877800	the matrix. They were Swiss. They were not German. They were Swiss. And they had, they had a leader
4877800	4881720	they were always in contact with. Super hot.
4885800	4891240	Wow. Okay. Yeah, please, Robert, and, and, and we'll contact Chris.
4893800	4901320	That's been really fascinating. I think the virtue of this theory is that it is falsifiable.
4901320	4907480	In other words, if there's no way in the brain, forget it, this theory is wrong. And that's exactly
4907480	4912840	the question we're going to be looking at next week. I look forward to having your contributions.
4914840	4927400	Awesome. Thank you all. See you at 16 UTC on July 29th. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Bye.
