00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,040
Hello and welcome. It's August 16th, 2023. We're in the Collective Behavior Discussion

2
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:24,280
section of the Active Inference for the Social Sciences course in 2023. So perhaps let us

3
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:35,680
all go around and give an opening introduction and or reflection and see who joins and what

4
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,120
happens from there. But just so that everybody has said hello.

5
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:57,840
Hi everyone, I'm Bryn. I'm PM in South Africa and yeah, just excited to be here and see what

6
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:17,840
happens. Hi, I'm Andrew. I'm a graduate student in Indiana and I guess my field of interest

7
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,480
now is the knowledge management and I think that figuring out how we collectively learn

8
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:32,680
and can share information is a really interesting topic and I'd like to see how this would apply.

9
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:46,560
Hi, I'm Regina and I'm from Guatemala, but I'm living in Spain, studying and doing experiments

10
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:54,400
related to this topic and trying to learn a little bit of the theory that's behind it so we can, you know,

11
00:01:54,400 --> 00:02:05,360
advance better. I'm excited. Hello, my name is Sasha. I'm calling in from California. I'm also a graduate

12
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:13,480
student. Yeah, just really enjoyed the spirited presentation last week. I'm looking forward to

13
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:26,720
discussion. All right, well, how about anyone can give a first reflection on collective behavior or

14
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:36,960
what was their thought or context before and where are they at as we kind of begin? Yeah, Regina.

15
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:49,560
Okay, so I just want to make sure that I understand because I took like two big lessons from your

16
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:57,800
lesson, right? And the first one is that, you know, this famous model of active inference that has

17
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:07,160
the agent and the environment and the mark of blanket in the middle, right, and just interacts

18
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:13,520
with everything, right? So I think what I got from what you discussed, maybe I didn't have a good

19
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:22,040
definition of an agent, but first that you can have that agent not be just an individual, but also

20
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:29,720
your definition of an individual changes, depending on what you want to study in the behavior, right?

21
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:39,800
So an agent can be an ant, it can be an ecosystem, it can be an eye looking at something, or it can

22
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:46,120
be as a society, for example. And I think that's a big take for me because it changes a lot the

23
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:53,720
concept of how to study things and use active inference just by changing how big the agent can

24
00:03:53,720 --> 00:04:00,000
be. So I don't know if I got that right, right? So first that clarification.

25
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,960
So what is an agent?

26
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:15,080
Yeah, so I don't know if there's like a formal definition of an agent in active inference, right?

27
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:23,240
But if we, if we want to study whatever we want to study, because I'm not going to study because I

28
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:31,120
have to do that's like my goal, whatever I'm doing. So I want to study whatever I have to choose

29
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:38,200
what's going to be my agent and the environment it has. So choosing the agent, you can do it to

30
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:46,760
create a model or to make an experiment, whatever. But the choice you make, it will depend on your

31
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,720
and what you understand as an individual or as an agent, I think so, right?

32
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,600
Awesome. Anyone have a thought on that?

33
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:16,720
No, if I continue with just to add something else and this will be my mind. And then I'm thinking is that

34
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:29,320
also a big problem that we have or I think I have is that since I am part of the environment, you

35
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:33,920
know, you know, the perspective of whoever is studying whatever it is, it's also going to be an

36
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:41,280
effect in it. So maybe, maybe scientists already decided, but I don't know that we can never have an

37
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:49,400
objective way of studying something if you're part of the environment of the agent. So I don't know

38
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:54,800
we already forgot it, or we already decided that's it. We cannot have objective observations of

39
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:01,480
behavior in general. But you know, you always think about like the agent environment, and you

40
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:07,520
start in it as something else, but the something else is also affecting it. So I see that as a

41
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:13,120
problem, or maybe something that has to be said, like, we are not objective, because we're part of

42
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:20,240
what it's affecting our agents in the behavior collectively too. So those are the thoughts I

43
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,280
have to share.

44
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:31,400
Regina, I'm also new to all of this. So my preliminary understanding of what is an agent,

45
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:42,120
is anything that has any good reason to self evidence, and to itself, or to survive,

46
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:49,160
that doesn't want to dissipate, that might delineate the boundary of what an agent is that then

47
00:06:49,160 --> 00:07:02,760
sets up the boundaries with which it will, as you described, start interacting with the world,

48
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:08,880
the environment. So if something, as I understand it, if something has a reason to go on being, to

49
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:16,400
survive, then it is an agent in the world.

50
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:25,240
Okay, but that agent could be anything, right? Like, is that what you're saying, right? Like, if he

51
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:31,720
wants to survive, can be an ant surviving individually, or a cell or a group? Okay, yeah,

52
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,600
that's a good, that's like a good definition.

53
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:42,040
Yeah, Sasha.

54
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:52,160
Great points, Regina. So much to say there. It's something that I have experienced with as a

55
00:07:52,160 --> 00:08:00,400
researcher in biology is deciding the kind of the statistics or sampling approach to use,

56
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:08,080
whether we're taking, you know, one cell from one individual, or we're taking many cells from

57
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:15,880
many individuals, and how to do the statistics and kind of sampling approach on that. That is a,

58
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:22,080
you know, an evergreen question that we're always reevaluating to see how to think about the

59
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:31,280
independencies within biological systems. And then another thing that you mentioned was about

60
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:37,640
the individual being part of the ecosystem. And that makes me think a lot about complexity

61
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:44,680
science and something that is addressed there in thinking about the interplay of the scientists

62
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:51,400
and what they're studying. Yeah, thank you for those points.

63
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:06,760
Sasha, sorry, I'm not raising my hand. I'm just unmuting. That's okay. Can you say a bit more

64
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,400
about what you mean by complexity science? It is

65
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:26,800
maybe muted. Oh, can't speak at the moment.

66
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:37,480
Yeah, complexity science has looked at agent, agent based modeling as a fundamental tool,

67
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:45,560
John Holland signals and boundaries, focusing on what, from an active inference side, we might say

68
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:53,320
as like message passing or communication for the messages and then boundaries with the whole

69
00:09:53,320 --> 00:10:01,080
discussion around the boundaries in the world, map territory, map territory fallacy, map territory

70
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:11,480
fallacy, fallacy, doing iterative modeling. Sasha brought up limited experimental resources in the

71
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:17,880
scientific setting. And that's kind of analogous to the limited energy budget or attentional

72
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:26,360
budget, ultimately, or just decision making budget of the kinds of active entities that

73
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:34,680
make sense to model the ones that kind of have those characteristics. This is really the question

74
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:41,880
of what makes something first principles or what are the first principles. One aspect of it as brought

75
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:49,480
up is the censoring of the persistence. So from the outside, that's kind of like an empiricist's

76
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:57,000
view of persistence, like is it measurable, but not saying that something is necessarily that,

77
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,160
which is the statistical tool. And then the sort of like inside out implementation type.

78
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:13,560
But there's a lot more to say in that who wants to bring in some new angle or

79
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:19,960
or how do they see collective behavior? Why do we talk about collective behavior?

80
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:26,440
Why not just behavior, recognize that behavior is multi scale or is social?

81
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:37,640
What's really being communicated with the collective?

82
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:49,880
I mean, I believe that we chose those levels so we can make it more simple for our brains to

83
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:55,720
understand it. Because if we talk about collective behavior, actually is the universe

84
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:04,760
behaving in the particles and everything, right? So I don't know if that's a little bit just based

85
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:10,600
on I don't know what's the word like just in the material world and how it physically moves.

86
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:20,440
And that's like deterministic or whatever, right? But I think we chose to have those limitations

87
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:25,320
so we could understand the world. But also we should acknowledge that are limited because we're

88
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:32,440
part of the system. I'm having a little trouble on my kind of understanding the

89
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:43,800
I guess where the schism lies between kind of the Markov blanket and the Umwelt in

90
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:48,680
semiotics of like the animals sensory experience.

91
00:12:49,000 --> 00:13:03,080
Anyone have a maybe maybe someone could I mean, Daniel, do you know

92
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,520
like the difference between that two?

93
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:12,360
Can you be a little louder? Thank you though. Andrew, anyone have a thought on that?

94
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:18,360
I'll bring in a definition of Umwelt and then and then we can see. But meanwhile,

95
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:25,800
does anyone have a thought? Sorry, I was just muted on Zoom. Andrew, you're a little quiet,

96
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:32,920
but I'm going to bring in a definition of Umwelt and then meanwhile, does anyone have a thought?

97
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,680
I hope I'm not

98
00:13:49,400 --> 00:14:00,120
the diluting Andrews question. But I think of collective behavior in kind of like a,

99
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:05,560
I don't know, football team or soccer team. And what that provides

100
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:11,240
is the the group who is

101
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:20,760
share some common ethos and what that does to the how that regulates the their collective or

102
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:27,640
individual and collective free energies during a match or throughout the season and how that

103
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:45,960
that gives some charge to some investment because it's my team against yours. And we have to try

104
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:56,120
and win. And so, you know, without without that collective behavior, it's it's might be far harder

105
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:05,160
to achieve groups goals if they aren't able to collaborate and share, you know, implicitly and

106
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:11,720
explicitly certain traits, behaviors, thoughts, feelings, ideals, ideologies, whatever they might be

107
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,760
and how that then allows us to compete in the world.

108
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:28,920
I see what you think it's it's been. Yes. Okay. Okay. I see what you're seeing,

109
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:33,640
especially because we're watching the World Cup, right? Women's World Cup.

110
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:40,520
Yeah. So it's very relevant. Yeah. But I see that in all the

111
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:46,840
these things you've said, it seems that for you behavior needs to have like a goal.

112
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:52,920
And I don't know if I if I agree with that, it's either survival or winning.

113
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:59,480
But for me, it's just something that happens. And maybe the consequence is surviving.

114
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:06,840
But it's not the goal to survive or to win the game. I mean, in the football, it is right.

115
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:13,320
But in general, maybe there's no goal to the behavior collectively.

116
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:18,920
It's just just a thought. It's interesting.

117
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:29,320
Yeah, a great comments. Well, the paper of Connor Heinz at all on the collective behavior as

118
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:37,560
surprise minimization that points the way towards using the act in fontology, these kinds of modeling

119
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:43,480
approaches for collective behavioral situations, and really just recognizing them as a certain type

120
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:50,840
of behavioral modeling. The simplest case might just be a single closed system.

121
00:16:51,800 --> 00:17:01,800
All part of the composition that leads to the ability to describe at very least a lot of

122
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,720
different kinds of systems, just like a linear model can describe a lot of systems. So then

123
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:12,840
it's also really interesting, a topic that came up in one of the recent textbook groups

124
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:22,600
with what's normative about active inference. Because the term of the process theory, even

125
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:29,400
of active inference, being normative is mentioned multiple times. And that's definitely a topic

126
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:38,520
that connects to the social sciences. One can imagine the kind of niche normativity or niche

127
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:47,240
regularities in a broad sense, and then the real minute particulars of how they play out,

128
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:56,920
which kind of hints at the kind of descriptive or causal minimum to start making some

129
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:01,000
anything but toy specific generative models.

130
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:15,160
So it's been an interesting theme to see even already in Avel's and Ben's lectures and discussions.

131
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:26,520
This question between description, process of describing, which is what I associated with

132
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:33,560
Professor Gordon's approach to ant watching, how that descriptive process,

133
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:41,080
which is what we can say that we have for active inference, just like a linear modeling ecosystem

134
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:49,560
could say about their linear modeling in principle, and how to then articulate the

135
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:57,720
normativities of the framework, if that concept, if that separation can even exist

136
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:11,240
from the behavioral normativities that include the basis of social fabric in all different

137
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,280
kinds of communities.

138
00:19:50,040 --> 00:20:06,360
Here's another question. So what is the role of any technical detail in the social sciences,

139
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:15,880
whether more on the statistical connecting with data or more category,

140
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:23,880
theoretic like just formal? What's the role of formal methods in

141
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:31,320
different kinds of academic or practical expressions about social systems?

142
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:44,200
Does it matter at all how we think about a framework at all?

143
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:55,160
Well, for formalizing aspects of a social system, I would say that the purpose is for

144
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:05,640
communication between individuals, because just we can't verify that.

145
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:12,360
Well, formalizing is just setting a system on top of what you're observing,

146
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:22,280
but there is no explicit guarantee that you're saying encompasses everything of the phenomena

147
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:36,600
you're observing. And just kind of going back to Taoism of the name that can be named is not

148
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:45,720
the true eternal name. And so it's just a way of, it's a slice of what we can observe,

149
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:54,840
and the way to, you know, maybe you can make predictions or maybe you can generate something

150
00:21:54,840 --> 00:22:03,640
that acts like the phenomena you're observing, but it's just a way to kind of,

151
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:14,920
it's just a way to kind of approximate our understanding of some phenomena and you have

152
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,760
to slice it in a specific way, but also understanding that it is a slice or,

153
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,560
you know, it is a tangent line that you're approximating as opposed to

154
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:26,840
encompassing the whole system from verbalizing it.

155
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:38,520
I was at, maybe it's not the goal, but something that happened instead of

156
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:46,840
describing any system, like Andrew said, it's like the goal to modify it or to

157
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:54,440
or to co-opt it in some way to gain control or whatever. If you know the model,

158
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:02,200
you know how to play the game, kind of. So you write instructions and try to see if you can

159
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:09,960
outsmart someone else. I mean, it sounds kind of dark, right? But maybe it's one of the goals to

160
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:14,040
or something that just happens out of nulling the rules that nobody else's knows.

161
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,760
I mean, I guess when you talk about control, there is a

162
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:31,800
shade that can be gained from that specific wording, but control in terms of, you know,

163
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:37,400
control theory or, you know, that comes from electrical engineering. It's really just what

164
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:45,400
shapes the behavior or what are the inputs that drive the behavior. And when you're talking about

165
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:51,160
control, it's really just about, well, if you change these inputs, how does that change the

166
00:23:51,160 --> 00:24:00,360
behavior? And so you can actually, you know, from electrical engineering of controlling some sort

167
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:07,640
of electromechanical system, but then you can make analogous statements on like control into

168
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:12,600
society, which doesn't necessarily mean like the dark negative control. But like, you know, maybe

169
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:19,320
there's some pathological behavior in a society or, you know, even pathological

170
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:28,440
pathological responses within the brain. And it's like, well, what is what is driving that?

171
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:38,600
And is it possible to change the drivers of that to have something that is more beneficial to the

172
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:55,000
system? Yeah, just to add to what Andrew's saying, because it matters sometimes how you manipulate

173
00:24:55,320 --> 00:25:07,000
you know, a system or it matters how you affect a brain. So it cannot be random. I mean, you know,

174
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:13,640
we've come a long way, for example, from lobotomy, which had disastrous effects. And

175
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:24,520
it matters to a system how you affect it. And so to know more formally, the most effective way

176
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:31,640
to create a desired effect, whatever that might be, it's essential that it's not just kind of poking

177
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:45,480
and prodding. As much as that is part of the scientific method to update that method in

178
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:55,800
accordance with what you're learning. So it is important. No, I think you're both right. I

179
00:25:55,800 --> 00:26:03,800
didn't have to be back. But also something that Andrew said about predicting, I think that's one

180
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:15,160
of also the big goals, trying to predict whether to be prepared to, or just to, I mean, couldn't be

181
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:22,520
to control, right? But if you can somehow predict how people respond to this or how a system will

182
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:32,360
behave in this other scenario, you can, you know, change what input is, or prepare for whatever comes,

183
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:46,200
I guess. Yeah, a lot of great points. Some of the commonly held, not equally by everyone, everyone,

184
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:52,680
but some of the tenants of science being to explain predict designing control,

185
00:26:54,440 --> 00:27:01,560
where explanation and prediction are on the pathway towards systems designing and

186
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:08,280
and maintenance and other other words that people can add. But that's the pragmatic utility oriented

187
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:13,640
view, which doesn't have to be an absolutist view. But certainly there are regimes of attention

188
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:23,160
socially, now and seemingly for long, long times, where people were wanting to retain and to

189
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:30,280
constrain the variance distribution on what we would say is their generative model, some norm,

190
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:37,320
and then other times, engaging in these functions. And that instrumentalist usage of active inference

191
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:46,600
is like, we're going to be able to model it with a pretty minimum framework that's commonly used

192
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:52,840
in statistical systems, where some things we observe and some we don't. And at least we know

193
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:59,000
and how all the pieces are connected. And then that is an artifact in model based design,

194
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:09,880
as people develop that line through time socially, just like probably has been always

195
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:14,840
the case for complex projects and scientific collaboration.

196
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,120
There's a few other interesting pieces, but yeah, please, please.

197
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:28,760
I'm just, I'm just wondering if now that I'm thinking a lot, isn't that like a problem

198
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:36,440
for confirmation bias, right? Like, there's a paper in here here, because we create the

199
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:41,560
knowledge and we tell everyone the knowledge. This is the model, this is how everything behaves.

200
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:47,480
And then we update our knowledge about it. And then we look for everything to just,

201
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:57,160
you know, confirm it. And, and yeah, maybe there's another system that will not let us be

202
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:02,200
getting knowledge so slowly, because if everybody just agrees on something,

203
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:07,080
we teach it to everyone, and we confirm the model, and then we just try to look for evidence for

204
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:13,160
that model, then we go slowly if there's any better thing or better model that comes along.

205
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:22,840
Yeah, a lot to say about that, like, if we believe that trees exist or that people exist,

206
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,800
and then we come to see them. So there's kind of this sense where problem

207
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:31,960
confirmation bias, which I think it's a great term, a great topic to bring in with definitely also

208
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:37,400
what's called like the golden nail syndrome or something. If all you have is the hammer,

209
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:42,520
then everything's a nail. And there's definitely a tension there, because it's like,

210
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:48,520
how much of what you can do, are you supposed to do something that you can't do?

211
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:53,720
Or, but then at least you could do what you needed to do to get there. So that's actually

212
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:57,560
within your scope of what you can do. So it's not that there are things that you can do that you

213
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:07,320
can't do, if just from measurement perspective. So like, how does it look? Or how do we recognize

214
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:16,680
across systems? Or how do we have awareness in situations as limited individuals who do have

215
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:24,600
all of these cognitive phenomena, how to make decisions or sense making or infrastructure

216
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:32,040
or whatever it is, the socialness, the system of interest of the social sciences, make that

217
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,160
and then dot dot dot normatively what?

218
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:47,800
I think there's some protection built into the problem of confirmation bias because

219
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:55,560
all knowledge generation is happening in an open system. And so there's always going to be an

220
00:30:55,560 --> 00:31:05,160
agent outside of your own mind and what it's perceiving that can then challenge or add to the

221
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:18,040
you know, like the LK-99 semiconductors that have been all the rage recently and how

222
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:27,640
other scientists have now kind of discredited it quite convincingly. And it's because of this open,

223
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:32,520
they might have had degrees of confirmation bias that they were egging each other on,

224
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:40,200
but it's ultimately been refuted, which is this built-in kind of protection because it's all

225
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:53,240
operating in an open system, fortunately. Yeah, a lot to say there. Monday morning, reviewer doing.

226
00:31:54,120 --> 00:32:03,960
How do we again go from any given description of a communicative event like the kind of specific

227
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:13,320
unfolding of the LK-99 narrative as yet uncompleted in the minds of some, which is real enough

228
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:20,120
to be real socially. And so how do we go from any descriptive anything about that?

229
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:33,640
Total observation to core screening. Then how do we come to work with that interface with

230
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:36,360
what whatever that is hands that to us?

231
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:56,360
What is the social behavior or some some classic or some novel social behaviors?

232
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:07,080
Maybe ones that seem pretty obvious, due to recency bias.

233
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:25,000
I'll just mention one aspect that Andrew and I have also talked about is the auto-poetic

234
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:32,680
nature of information systems. Andrew, do you have any thought on this?

235
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:41,960
Or about where auto-poesis comes into like social sciences or these kinds of models?

236
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:47,720
Daniel, Andrew just left a note that he needs a... Okay, okay.

237
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:53,480
Oh, totally. He just wasn't looking at the time. Funny stuff.

238
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,480
Anyone else have a thought on that?

239
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:07,320
Okay, just to kind of carry forward then. Basically, the ability of social systems that

240
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:18,120
include written niche modification, cumulative culture, their increasing extent of control.

241
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:25,640
As discussed earlier, that definitely is a bit of an overloaded or at least doubly meant term

242
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:30,040
in different settings, because it can just simply mean modeling it with control theory,

243
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:35,080
which is a pretty limited philosophical statement relative to any statistical method,

244
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:42,440
or control like the kind that people are unhappy with and the kind that's described in

245
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:49,320
thinking like a state. A lot of other works that I know, Mao and Lorena and Avel are going to be

246
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:57,480
definitely going into more detail on... So when societies can model

247
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:06,680
and introspect or self-reflect formally, much better.

248
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:19,000
And that can happen through anything from free and open source,

249
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:27,800
better aided protocols. There's many limited formats of self-meaning making, but cryptography

250
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:32,520
definitely allows those explorations. And that doesn't necessarily mean computer cryptography.

251
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:38,280
That could also be like linguistic encoding and all these other ways of niche

252
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:49,560
sub-differentiation in multi-scale systems. You just do not see a system that is cookie cutter.

253
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:57,400
It's very rare in ecosystems. There are algal blooms and things like that.

254
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:05,480
So when we really think about the developmental and the cognitive and the selective niche,

255
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:12,200
which is a concept that Axel Constant and others have differentiated in some of their

256
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:21,160
like ecological active inference work, like that niche is very embodied, extended in culture,

257
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:28,520
et cetera, et cetera. It's just like a kind of cool direct way to open up to that challenge of

258
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:42,040
modeling and just bring some closures with different accounts or compatibilities with

259
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:48,600
different accounts. So like all, just to give one right of example, but maybe it'd be interesting

260
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:57,720
what other people think, all the expressions that people make in social settings can just simply

261
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:09,480
be their expressions or modeled as such. That is in one way implicitly what was always in play,

262
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:22,120
but now it's describable and legible and autonomous. So how do we take this active

263
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:28,360
inference collective behavior crossover and think about what it really means

264
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:33,960
in how we're going to be like thinking differently, even just this discussion forward

265
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:45,320
or like more locally are our understandings with collective behavior or with behavior.

266
00:37:52,120 --> 00:38:18,600
Yeah, and you can you ask the question again. I didn't actually catch the

267
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:30,520
question. How do we start to adapt some of these general comments or frames that are

268
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:37,720
in some ways disconnected from descriptions of real systems? How do we think about that

269
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:44,520
and and what it means now?

270
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:56,120
Do you mean on the document in front of us? These disconnected things in front of us

271
00:38:56,120 --> 00:39:02,840
there on the document? I don't know whatever you think or whatever you want to say.

272
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:16,840
Yeah, I think there's a lot and again I hope I'm not

273
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:26,520
fully understanding the question. I hope I'm not steering away too much, but I had a general

274
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:35,160
sense of what I think you were saying and I think it's an enormous problem with the amount of

275
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:46,520
information sharing just in a with let's just take the generative models of

276
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:55,640
social media and all of the platforms that are available to us. How much information we are

277
00:39:55,640 --> 00:40:07,960
privy to in any given moment and I'm kind of forgetting the question that you asked.

278
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:19,720
It's almost as if there is such a high rate of information and data flow that it's really

279
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:26,920
hard to know what to do with all of it and at least as a human being I'm not saying from machines

280
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:37,720
but as a psychologist I'm certainly interested in how humans are able to tolerate and respond to

281
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:55,720
the amount and rate of information that's out there.

282
00:40:55,720 --> 00:41:09,000
I mean this is not the first time this happens right? Like when we went from talking to writing

283
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:16,120
information then everyone wrote their information and then we have books and then we have libraries

284
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:23,480
and that's all available and again we have access if you can read right to all the information in

285
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:33,240
the world so we adapted to I don't know to get careers so we could specify in which type of

286
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:40,440
information you are going to know more so maybe we need some sort of new career types I don't know

287
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:48,040
more specification with more information. But is it not is the rate of information

288
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:55,800
uh flow and increases are not is it not exponential is it not um I don't know it's a crazy amount

289
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:01,400
on our brains cannot do anything about it so we have to do multidisciplinary things and work

290
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:09,640
together with others if we want to make something but yeah I don't know maybe we will die of excess

291
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:13,240
of information

292
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:49,960
how do people feel like active inference brings something to the discussion relative to

293
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,240
how they want to work towards

294
00:42:53,240 --> 00:43:11,560
answer yeah well isn't that the provocative question too but like any system that's that

295
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:16,920
that's the question everyone is going to have their own memes and themes and and systems that they

296
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:21,320
have spent time with and did fieldwork with and all this other like

297
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:26,600
particularity because a system that doesn't have particularity is just not going to be

298
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:36,200
hosting a broad enough niche for for phenotypic diversity it's just riding on the edge of a

299
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:42,200
razor instead of more like a fabric that continues to unfold I think

300
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:53,160
there's a lot of work to do with the social sciences and active inference just from what I was

301
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:57,080
like reading trying to find things for this

302
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:06,200
um discussion and just I personally wondered what is is meaningful or interesting

303
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:15,480
or useful what's epistemic and pragmatic value for different audiences how does it go from kind of

304
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:26,200
bringing citations that were not linked together in some more theoretical or more

305
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:33,400
generative model oriented work in active inference like epistemic foraging or the

306
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:40,120
inference model or any other kind of specific model what what are these different kinds of

307
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:42,520
scientific artifacts do

308
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:56,840
for who

309
00:44:56,840 --> 00:45:05,720
I guess I'm still learning very

310
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:09,560
very

311
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:18,360
kind of crudely ploddling along here Daniel with to try and answer that because it's

312
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:24,280
quickly realized that the field is it's so multi-nodal it has so much

313
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:35,320
and the free energy principle the Bayesian brain even just to psychology has so much

314
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:41,640
applicability and everyone seeing everyone I meet at these discussions is coming at it from

315
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:48,920
a different angle and it can be a bit confusing to hear how other people

316
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:55,400
are applying it how other people are making use of it

317
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:05,480
in all manner of ways and so I'm still learning how to apply to kind of ring fence the free energy

318
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:12,680
principle and connect it to psychological processes including collective behavior

319
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:18,760
and because there's a lot of psychopathology in group think in collective behavior but I'm also

320
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:23,400
very very interested in its application at the interface of

321
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:32,760
what happens between a a therapist and a patient and I'm often unlike other

322
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:41,960
professions who seem who are just by nature of the scientific method are able to extract

323
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:55,800
a lot more data to work with to analyze to you know in a that's very hard to do I feel very limited

324
00:46:56,440 --> 00:47:00,360
other than just making kind of theoretical leaps and inferences about how to apply

325
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:11,560
the free energy principle to psychology. I can't have a session with my brain hooked up to

326
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:20,840
an FMRI machine to get data and to see when a patient says Google bar that's a spike on the

327
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:27,160
spike trains which represents you know surprising and we can then solve for that in some way and

328
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:33,400
I don't have access to that sort of data flow so it feels limited but I'm still learning how to

329
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:49,320
apply it and yeah and trying to collaborate with colleagues on that the influence group.

330
00:47:55,480 --> 00:48:01,400
What are people wondering about collective behavior even if we're totally of course not

331
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:05,160
going to address it but just what what are the kinds of things that people

332
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:15,800
what makes you look up collective behavior instead of just behavior or individual behavior.

333
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:30,280
For me it's about safety and need to belong.

334
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:37,160
For me it's

335
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:46,360
I think that it depends where you come from and in the country you are but

336
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:52,040
there are places that are more collective and there are places that are more individualistic and I

337
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:58,120
think mostly non-western countries have a lot of collective behavioral knowledge and

338
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:06,440
spirits already right that they're already new these things that we think are new for us right how

339
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:13,560
the collective thing works for example I don't know you don't make a decision for yourself

340
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:20,360
you make a decision for the group like marrying you marry because you want an addition you want to

341
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:26,440
interact with someone or other group and that's something that affects the the collective not

342
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:32,840
just you so arranged marriage makes sense something like that right so for me making that

343
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:38,040
distinction about individual collective comes from understanding that I don't know there are

344
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:43,720
other places that are already ahead in what collective means in terms of human beings and

345
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:49,320
how to interact and the worst through all we have all this individualistic thing which is

346
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:57,480
very interesting because why do we have a same species and then we have very different approaches

347
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:03,000
of how to understand ourselves in terms of what the individual is and why it matters

348
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:20,440
yes there's so much loaded on different understandings among people including

349
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:26,440
even the the essence of the social which is who are people and what is the

350
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:38,920
the obligation and how do we view that that relationship that's a very very deep area and

351
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:43,320
and again the part that just kept returning to me in the lecture and when I was trying to think

352
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:52,680
about how to how to even reflect part of this very large area is like what is the adjective doing

353
00:50:52,920 --> 00:51:00,600
and what what is what's the reference point by which this is being said in the speech acts

354
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:09,160
like people often will dismiss I don't mean to you know straw people but dismiss collective

355
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:13,800
behavior by saying well we are explaining individual behavior what are you explaining

356
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:22,440
beyond the estimates in the colony and then the exterior like that is it and so that can feel

357
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:28,600
like looking at the same thing from two different sides and there are different methods like some

358
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:35,640
methods blur over individuals a lot more like statistical methods that might correspond to

359
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:39,720
demographics and then on the other hand like more agent-based models

360
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:50,680
but how much variability in what shared variability in white general

361
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:56,360
synchronies amongst different quantum reference frames all these nested

362
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:06,280
if these possibilities that are grounded in wanting to explore mathematical and scientific

363
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:13,400
possibilities as as the literature of linear regression is full of so many incredible

364
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:24,360
extensions and and and similar and then that's I think what the course is even beginning to

365
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:31,880
to try to express and what what I understand in the works of the the other teachers and

366
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:38,840
like a lot of your backgrounds and and everything like that is where is that

367
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:48,120
moment where it is not only science because science is not simply the social

368
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:54,360
so science has an activity and then as there's a diffusion away from science

369
00:52:54,360 --> 00:53:01,800
and and I think that or or at least that relationship between social and science is

370
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:09,000
right there in the title maybe that's kind of like a science major's take but but it is itself

371
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:18,600
in a way a um presenting a dilemma with what science means there and then that's the frame game

372
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:26,600
who's doing social science who's doing not social science and that's that's where

373
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:35,480
in in the culture I'm sitting in slash in the technical side of that it is related to statistics

374
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:47,320
and formality it's the xkcd comic and the way that formalisms and and details are taken as

375
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:55,560
under some regimes of attention basically definitive and yet there's like a yearning

376
00:53:55,560 --> 00:54:04,760
and a counter balancing that's expressed also in many ways and so that's and science maybe

377
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:09,720
some people feel like certain social scientific methods that's like not far enough in this dimension

378
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:16,120
and then the others feel like they're too far in this direction but it's like just like any

379
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:21,720
like that academic field let alone any other community of diverse agents like of course

380
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:30,280
there's going to be distributions of perspectives at different times and and at takes rate of

381
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:40,680
uptake by those different perspectives and no yeah Daniel do you think uh these first principles

382
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:51,560
would be able to explain why uh an ant colony exists uh I know that was your um a kind of

383
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:59,080
area of interest of study uh why an ant colony exists uh in in the way that it is as a kind of

384
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:10,840
operating as a collective and why um another animal is able to survive and achieve its goals

385
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:20,520
as an individual only relying on the environment and its actions and sensations to get its needs

386
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:28,360
met and to no doubt minimize its free energy but could first principles explain why the one

387
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:34,360
has to survive as a group and the other has to survive or is able to survive um and the different

388
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:43,480
conditions yeah that's a super interesting question it's it's very core to this individual

389
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:51,560
individuation and multi-scale individuation concept like is the nest made the individual and

390
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:57,640
then the colony is the social because then for sure it's super collaborative or is the colony

391
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:04,280
the organism and the nest mates are tissues and then are they social across colony boundaries

392
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:08,520
not where I was in Arizona but they're often friendly across different species and they

393
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:14,040
avoided conflict more often than not so it's like well and then go it why does it even matter

394
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:21,240
what's happening on this plot of lands in this in this area from like a biomimic

395
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:28,680
perspective we might learn new algorithms it's a sandbox for learning new techniques and

396
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:34,520
observation all these other like richnesses so it's to say though like what comes away from that

397
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:43,400
science that makes it social science and I think there's a lot of disciplinary ways of

398
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:49,160
understanding that which which I'm definitely not expert in in in the um professional fields like

399
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:57,320
counseling but probably in in all the different humanities and histories and all these other

400
00:56:57,320 --> 00:57:09,720
fields all these different maps the kind of social um the epistemic organizing question

401
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:18,120
and then the social organizing question yeah and and the way like technology is also in that

402
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:26,520
tangle and yeah someone pointed out like this is not a new problem and uh but then it's like well

403
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:31,080
what parts are new and then what's our model by which we're saying that it's like new or two

404
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:35,640
individualists or two collective on what scale what if they're like really collectivist at this

405
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:43,960
scale but not at this scale or another an example of an ambiguous or at least like um poly poly

406
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:50,280
submits phenotype of colonies is in some colonies there's partial reproductive activation

407
00:57:50,920 --> 00:58:00,600
of like non reproductive nests and that has often been modeled from like a position of like

408
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:07,080
zero is the law and how are they cheating above this but it's also been approached from a

409
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:16,120
colony level strategic bed hedging so without super deep knowledge of really some of the specifics

410
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:24,600
of the regularities that that colony algorithm had to persist for so long and to have gotten swept

411
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:30,760
off the table if it was even it's like that's that's a very integrated problem so it helps you

412
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:35,800
approach collective systems and and learn about them but it's like there's a lot to say about

413
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:44,600
humidity loss in foraging and humidity loss isn't even the whole picture and human foraging is a

414
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:52,360
lot more sophisticated from just like a perception cognition influence perspective

415
00:58:54,280 --> 00:59:00,440
so those are just some ant related thoughts but it's it just centers a lot of discussions that

416
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:06,760
really matter and I think the really interesting piece is not always in the way that they're

417
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:14,920
thought to by some yeah and it's and it's very hard to get any kind of

418
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:24,600
cross pollination or to see cross pollination uh studying one agent it's it's quite for at least

419
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:29,960
in my mind very difficult to kind of generalize things across different agents and it starts

420
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:42,840
getting a bit uh yeah tricky to infer one collectives and uh how and why and and how

421
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:50,360
they survive and how another agent does it's tricky so I'm almost just kind of an agent

422
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:55,560
human beings as hard as they are to study and just try and run with it as far as possible

423
00:59:56,520 --> 01:00:02,280
yeah otherwise it's just information overload

424
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:22,120
body's a complex place too and digital technology virtuality these are such um

425
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:26,520
richly developed topics in the social sciences I only know the tiniest amount from

426
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:35,720
but I think that through participation and inclusion in collaboration and in conversations

427
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:46,520
and everything there's going to be a lot of interesting connections and paths um and

428
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:55,480
and it's being approached seemingly uh multiple layers like within the the two layers that just

429
01:00:55,480 --> 01:01:02,200
we can focus most narrowly on it's like within the realm of science what is science which is

430
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:08,520
kind of like playing this other um role with inertia in some people's minds and in systems

431
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:12,120
what is science who gets to decide what social sciences I don't know I'm I'm not in social

432
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:19,080
science but it's system of interest in society and certainly I'm a part of that um so it's like

433
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:29,480
what is the what is good technically what is social scientific and then what is that social

434
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:36,120
scientific how does that going to interface into the the metaphysical questions and and the normative

435
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:46,280
ethical and um decision making with trade-offs and the real reflexive complex decisions that matter

436
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:56,120
also while recognizing this increasingly nuanced way of thinking about different social intelligences

437
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:14,120
what's any other random thought or curiosity about collective behavior

438
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:32,280
one point that I would have added into the uh lecture was just that in distributed systems

439
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:40,840
whether as modeled or as such all behavior is arising from interactions local to individuals

440
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:45,080
even if it's sent through some wireless mechanism it's like all about the local interactions

441
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:54,680
and so that is a an arising type process that gives the modeler like one hands-off layer

442
01:02:55,000 --> 01:03:04,680
at least if not much more another nice feature about them um they are in a way

443
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:13,160
waiting to be composed because they intrinsically contain like at least two layers of consideration

444
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:19,160
now whether there's kind of like a forcing function of one layer and just sort of dangling

445
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:24,040
a bottom layer or whether there's a lot of what we would call emergence or discussive in in that way

446
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:31,640
like that more arising function can be modeled but in either way then you can kind of wrap

447
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:38,360
that two-layer system and then compose them so that's like what enables in certain situations

448
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:45,720
like parallelization or at least you know that's obviously a big area but that's what allows multi

449
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:53,160
agent simulation frameworks to do well on certain very challenging

450
01:03:54,760 --> 01:04:01,640
sense making and action selection problems not by guarantee or default because any given

451
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:08,200
slicing and dicing of any given um prompting of information may not help you adapt

452
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:18,440
but there are paths that do and don't help persist or not and that's this kind of persistence

453
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:30,360
starting place that we began with Sasha um can I really resonate with what you mentioned about

454
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:42,120
the local interactions that even if information is transmitted over long distances then the agents

455
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:49,960
behave in a way that is locally relevant and integrates that information and it actually

456
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:59,560
makes me think a lot about the like psychology therapy angle that while you try to get information

457
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:08,920
about persons like um sort of local environment and behavior um or like perhaps you know demographics

458
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:17,240
and age that um their informational environment and like wealth of what kind of information they

459
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:30,280
consume might also be really telling about their uh psychological and like behavior interactions or

460
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:41,800
pathologies um and then to bring it kind of full circle back to um that the researcher is part of

461
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:54,760
the ecosystem that they are uh studying um yeah I I think it's just um such a difference in

462
01:05:54,760 --> 01:06:01,240
perspective to see that as like a positive and a gift that um the way that you would design and

463
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:07,160
run an experiment today is not the way that you would do it two years from now with more experience

464
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:16,920
and so um that is a a a benefit and like a bonus in the system and not um like a negative

465
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:24,920
perspective of bias that it's detracting from some underlying uh truth or reality

466
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:28,360
so just a few thoughts

467
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:37,960
oh very interesting anyone want to add something

468
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:50,520
I think we didn't fully resolve this early question about the umvelte um term from ethology

469
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:58,200
behavioral research observation science uh using the term to describe the world as its experience

470
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:04,360
by a particular organism I think a few different pieces and there's a lot of discussion in discourse

471
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:10,680
or just just to give it like a super short overview the world we might connect to world

472
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:17,960
modeling and there's a lot of interesting work in all kinds of different like pros focus on

473
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:24,920
qualitative systems as well as some artificial or synthetic intelligence world modeling as it

474
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:31,720
experienced as it is experienced is one of the sticky and deep ones because this is the area

475
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:39,480
phenomenology and so this is like a kind of semi-eternal discussion point so whether whether

476
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:46,280
active inference delivers on world modeling is kind of empirical and just plain whereas as it

477
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:52,440
is experienced is going to be a philosophical question and then by a particular organism

478
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:58,920
that specificity we get by actually making the generative model even if we're just speculating

479
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:06,840
about it it's like talking about experience without an experiencer would be like talking about um

480
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:16,360
some agent's behavior without reference to its niche and then where there is like that complex

481
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:24,360
negotiation I think the humanities and a lot of the social sciences have identified a lot of the

482
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:34,840
structural top down and also the personal bottom up motifs of of things being

483
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:44,440
blurred and made complex and so I think part of the social and the scientific as

484
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:54,280
coming only from scientific side is like to to meet in a third space and or at least make it work

485
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:57,080
to have a mutual compromise where it's like

486
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:04,920
certain social science social oriented claims based upon this scientific measure

487
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:10,120
that is going to be a judgment call but understanding that conversation where is it a

488
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:17,080
mutual compromise and like what dimensions not simply along the kind of like rigor accessibility

489
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:24,040
or implications axis there's just very many things in play in these iterated relationships in ecosystems

490
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:43,800
like having a researcher as part of the ecosystem well what is it here's here's the forager question

491
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:48,920
you see the nested on the ground it's a forager but then we step back it's like okay well it's foraging

492
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:57,320
and then that's the allocation of the forager then it's foraging is still part of this sense

493
01:09:57,320 --> 01:10:04,520
making is generative sense making with like process understanding even of a trace which is something

494
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:10,120
that Bruno Latour and others have have explored with like following a trace in a social setting

495
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:18,360
and using that to to trace networks so in our digital ecosystems though our information ecosystems

496
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:26,200
is not research happening and so what what does that really mean and then what what are those

497
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:33,160
social normativeities there's going to be like a meeting or a handoff with with where that really

498
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:45,800
is happening or maybe it's a knocking on the door that's ignored or it could be whatever

499
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:51,960
metaphor in that setting it actually is there's no general metaphor because that'd be like oh what's

500
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:59,000
the general metaphor on this experiment which experiment just the general action that we play

501
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:12,200
the sake oh hard to say

502
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:36,120
okay well in our last like actions I guess if anybody types a question live chat we'll look

503
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:49,400
at it otherwise what are any other thoughts or like what what can we learn more about about

504
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:55,400
collective behavior or what will it mean for our sense making decision making if we understand

505
01:11:55,400 --> 01:12:08,600
collective behavior better

506
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:26,300
you

507
01:12:56,280 --> 01:13:02,920
what else are people excited about for the rest of the course

508
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:13,160
like based upon the sections that we've done so far

509
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:26,200
and and how we can even even start to approach this in an acknowledged limited finite way

510
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:30,120
yeah Sasha then than anyone else

511
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:39,480
I just added a question to the very bottom of the notes and it makes me think about

512
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:46,280
how working on this document collaboratively throughout the last hour we're able to

513
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:55,480
kind of leave a stigmatic trace of things we've discussed and what sort of traits or practices

514
01:13:55,480 --> 01:14:03,000
should individual humans I guess I should specify humans should be embodied in order to improve

515
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:09,880
cohesion in collective behavior it makes me think of certain psychology

516
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:18,680
traits or descriptions of like openness or conscientiousness

517
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:29,880
what will make individual humans better participants in collective behavior

518
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:47,560
yeah I think to to add to that to just emphasize the importance again only with human agents

519
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:56,120
specifically who have the capacity to think and reflect and the only ones that have that those

520
01:14:57,080 --> 01:15:03,800
really advanced capabilities that we know of as yet but to really kind of leverage

521
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:12,600
in order to make the collective better there's a responsibility on the individual

522
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:19,560
despite being part of a collective and on many different on many different fronts to be able to

523
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:28,200
leverage and utilize their own internal states and what they have learned and to be able to think

524
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:37,640
to retain the individual the individual's mind and think about the collective I think is so

525
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:46,440
important if the collective is to become healthier Sasha to your point and to improve its

526
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:57,560
you have to become more conscientious and become more responsible or whatever that might be

527
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:06,360
so to always try and maintain a thinking

528
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:18,120
self is crucial in words you can very easily be usurped into the collective as is

529
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:24,200
if you just go on any social media media platform you will see

530
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:28,760
individuals rarely thinking

531
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:36,600
for themselves and seemingly kind of just purely in each other and that causes massive problems

532
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:44,200
so an individual mind is strikes me as being just the most important thing in the future going forward

533
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:57,960
yeah this dialectic with individuation and collectivization as these like ongoing

534
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:03,960
negotiated compromises that can be also viewed many ways however they are

535
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:14,120
cognitive science coming into play

536
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:24,040
maybe historical processes or philosophies were

537
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:29,880
used in many settings for

538
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:38,680
even approaching these kinds of social questions and now with computer science and technology

539
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:47,000
it even like is a discussion more about the capacities of measurement and action

540
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:53,400
not that those are new in and of themselves like but thinking like a state like the development

541
01:17:53,400 --> 01:18:01,000
of the apparatus the development of the social social systems that can be run on on open source

542
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:11,000
hardware open source software things like that so I don't know if something's generalized across

543
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:22,440
all such groups but understanding what environments at least initially things are beginning at

544
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:32,360
is just a realist starting point probably no guarantee since most things slash all things

545
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:43,160
are swept off the table in their specifics anyway so and how to deal with that kind

546
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:50,840
of like skin on the line type of decision making is very interesting how it's pursued

547
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:58,440
in the in the sciences because often like many runs are presented or that kind of like like

548
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:02,840
catastrophic failure mode of models is is not considered just like part of the training starting

549
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:14,200
naive so just the way that different social considerations are converged upon it's never

550
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:20,760
it's not like reduced to one feature of the social because the social is such an open space

551
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:28,920
as a scientist always impressed by how that writing could kind of open up

552
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:37,800
the um situations which are like mundane but also of course very deep and meaningful

553
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:41,400
also though mundane

554
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:08,520
you

555
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:28,600
any other thoughts or otherwise uh on on collective behavior or on the social sciences

556
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:34,120
course or anything otherwise people can have any last words if they want

557
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:45,720
yeah awesome thank you all for participating David want to add anything

558
01:20:55,720 --> 01:20:59,800
yeah well i look forward to uh more questions being asked on the course

559
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:06,280
website and everybody's um engagement with the course is very much appreciated

560
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:12,520
so keep up the collective thanks for my scale learning and it's it's a fun course really happy

561
01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:16,520
that we could have done this session and very happy to have concluded the session

562
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:25,800
all right thank you bye bye bird ciao

563
01:21:36,280 --> 01:21:36,780
you
