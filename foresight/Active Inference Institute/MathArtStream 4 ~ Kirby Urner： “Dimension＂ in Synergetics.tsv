0	24000	Hello and welcome. It is July 12, 2024. We are in Actinth MathArtStream number four today joined by Kirby Erner. Kirby, please begin.
24000	49000	Okay. Thank you for having me, everyone. There's been a little bit of email traffic leading up to this and I've been attending to this channel and I wanted to just point viewers who see this later too that this is episode four and they're already on a journey and it has to do with visualizing the fourth dimension and applying art towards this challenge.
49000	70000	And it's kind of a puzzle piece that Daniel knows that I know for sure. I don't know if everyone knows but there is kind of, I feel in the hiker metaphor that you've climbed pretty high now and here's an overview of view of like a neighboring or adjacent space where 40 is also important fourth dimension, etc.
70000	87000	Now, I know there's some Wittgenstein knowledge around here so Operation Duck Rabbit is an allusion to the kind of Gestalt Shift you need and I just drew this. It's very poorly drawn. I have a doofy style of drawing. I'm influenced by Mad Magazine, I think.
87000	103000	And the rabbit looks kind of sad. You can see his kind of wiggly mouth. That's just trying to do feathers on the back of the duck's head. I was trying to like compromise there. So it's both a duck and a rabbit and this is one of the easy ones, right? There's a lot of these that flip at you.
103000	116000	Like this one, it's easy to go back and forth between the duck and the rabbit but some of them, you just can't do it. People try to help you. They coach you. Well, look at it like this and it doesn't help, right? You can't see the old lady or whatever they're trying to.
117000	129000	So that is a challenge and it's part of what it means to kind of ease into some new field. You have to develop the Gestalt's associated therewith.
129000	151000	So the outline of what I plan to do real quick, duck rabbit, kind of drawing from my Wittgenstein background. I had Rory who's into pragmatism as one of my thesis advisors. I did have to write a thesis even though I was just an undergrad at the time and defend it and blah, blah.
152000	160000	But I wrote on the later Wittgenstein, right? There's two Wittgenstines for those who aren't familiar. He's got sort of an early philosophy and a later philosophy.
161000	172000	So on that note of how things evolve, how we don't end up where we start necessarily, this picture shows what I'd call Euclidean geometry going forward in time.
172000	181000	And it kind of forks when they realize, oh, the fifth postulate, we could mess with that so we can have non-Euclidean geometry in that sense.
182000	187000	And relativity kind of comes in around there. I'm talking about Einstein. Euclidean continues.
187000	203000	And I'm forking off another namespace as I call it. Cinergeti is kind of more off of Einstein stuff than off what I call extended Euclideanism, which is ND Hilbert space fourth dimension as another spatial dimension, not time.
204000	210000	There's a difference. So there's three namespaces here. I'm drawing a triangle. I'm saying these exist and come and go.
211000	220000	So namespaces is like a shop talk, a context, or as Wittgenstein would say, a form of life, a grammar, like chess versus checkers.
221000	228000	They come with a whole different world, not just the games, but the tournaments, how it is, and then look more at some of the Bucky stuff.
229000	236000	What is it? Now let's start with the language game, since y'all are math fluent, don't feel bad about just starting with some notation.
237000	245000	In this culture, let's say these are like Mongols and Amalayas or something. Let's say we unearthed this archaeology. This existed at one point.
246000	255000	And instead of negative numbers and positive numbers, they decided to add another tuple. So the negatives, they've got a one to the right.
256000	261000	Now this may look bad. It's like, well, no, if it's on the right, then the tuple should be the rightmost tuple and blah, blah.
262000	265000	So you could flip it, whatever. Don't overthink it.
266000	274000	And then the same culture, when they want to get to a plane or a flat space, they do it like this with three fences.
275000	279000	You could call them reference lines, what we call vectors or rays or whatever.
280000	288000	And you can see how if you have a dot in this part of it between A and B, just using vector addition, right?
288000	290000	You only need so much A and so much B to get there.
291000	298000	So a combination, a linear combination of A and B basis vectors is sufficient to get any point in this part of the y.
299000	305000	This is just a flat y. There's no perspective implied here. There's no 90 degree angles. It's just a y flat on the plane.
306000	320000	But I'm showing how you have kind of a zero for everybody here in the third place because there is no C component of resonance of this triangle region.
321000	326000	Then we go to the quad version of it where we divide space into four quadrants.
327000	331000	Again, we add another coordinate for the new vector.
331000	336000	And by the way, there is a good example of using a y on a surface.
337000	340000	And that's the Jodie Foster, very large array.
341000	347000	I say Jodie Foster because she's in a movie where she talks to aliens through this or something like that.
348000	351000	But there's a y. So there's a way of thinking about the...
352000	360000	So there's a culture that does this and at what you would call or we would call the third dimension, we're already looking like this now.
361000	367000	We're going to address all the points in... I'd call it Euclidean space. It's the same space XYZ is about.
368000	372000	But we're using tuples. We're using four tuples instead of three tuples.
373000	378000	And we don't need negative numbers here because we've dealt with that issue in a different way.
379000	385000	It's still got all the same properties, however, of vector addition, linear combination.
385000	391000	This spans XYZ space. You could say everybody gets a four number address unique.
393000	399000	And so this is my cue when I get to the books is to jump to a slightly different track.
400000	401000	So fuller synergetics.
402000	407000	What I just showed you, the quadrate coordinates have all come out since synergetics.
408000	409000	They're not in this book synergetics.
410000	421000	And in fact, people felt maybe it's a weakness of Fuller's critique of XYZ and cubic orthodoxy that he didn't have an alternative really to propose.
422000	426000	And quadrates I think he would have been excited about, but he didn't live to see them.
427000	428000	So I just wanted to say that.
429000	433000	Now, where should we put Fuller historically?
433000	438000	Historically, like going back recently, he noticed I'm segueing on the books.
439000	440000	We got the postage stamp.
441000	446000	He's kind of in a way he's an academic, but he's also very much a cold warrior.
447000	448000	I think we can paint him that way.
450000	453000	Without much apology, he was military industrial complex in a way.
454000	457000	He worked with the military on shelter stuff.
457000	466000	And here I've found something buried in the archives where he's recommending someone to be in contact with Ho Chi Minh.
467000	471000	Somebody, some journalist, some British journalist, but he's saying, oh, you should send him to Vietnam, whatever.
472000	477000	So I don't know, you know, I'm not the super expert on this, but I do know that he worked very closely.
478000	482000	Pretty much his whole life with this gentleman, Abel White, who I talked about.
483000	489000	And Abel White knew this guy who's one of the CIA guys.
490000	491000	And there's Ezra Pound.
492000	503000	And these two corresponded a lot because back at Yale, when this guy ran a literary magazine called Orlando, he was always being in touch with Ezra Pound, going over Italy, met him and stuff.
503000	506000	So there's starting to be a literary flavor to what I'm talking about.
507000	512000	And also, why was Bucky a darling of the Pentagon?
513000	531000	Well, because of this is a modern version of what they got into the due line, the early, the early warning system about, you know, monitoring way up north around the Arctic circles to sense what kind of activities might be coming over the horizon from the other side of the Earth.
532000	535000	Meaning missiles, jets, who knows, right?
536000	541000	So, or what these are called weather stations as well, because they're useful for civilian purposes.
543000	545000	So you can say Fuller had this.
546000	558000	In fact, here's I have from from the trend tab lists, a recent posting I gave where I found an actual photograph of when one of his domes was in the garden of the Pentagon.
558000	567000	Like if the center surrounded by the five wings or whatever you call them in that garden, they did even put this dome there at some point.
568000	580000	Now, probably why I bring that up is because when I get to Coxeter and University of Toronto, I want to talk about our relationship between Coxeter and Fuller.
581000	591000	And I want to mention the Pentagon's support of the Bucky patent on the dome and how this led to some consternation and conflicts in a way.
592000	602000	I'm not going to spend a lot of time on that, but so here we are back in 1928 and Fuller's got this four D symbol kind of weird look in the teardrop shape.
603000	607000	Daniel's seen other versions or colored versions recently in the archives.
608000	609000	And this is way back from 28.
610000	616000	And he's throwing his hat in the ring, basically, as another one who's into this four D as a meme.
617000	620000	And four D, there's a lot of ferment at the early 1900s.
621000	630000	Now here we're talking 28, so we're quarter into quarter into it, but there's still a lot of thought and talk about what the fourth dimension means.
630000	631000	What it's about.
632000	635000	Where is it going with, you know, it's not that kind of drive.
636000	637000	Let's put it that way.
638000	648000	And a good way to pick up that story is to go back and read this book, The Fourth Dimension Non Euclidean Geometry and Modern Art by Linda Del Rimpel Henderson.
649000	654000	She does a really good job of tracing the multiple strands, the multiple schools of thought.
655000	660000	Now, I'd say there was kind of a shakeout over the course of the 1900s.
661000	666000	And they didn't all survive, let's say, but Fuller had a strong sense of branding.
667000	668000	He was into self promotion.
669000	672000	He didn't want to delegate how to advertise himself.
673000	674000	He thought that was the most important thing.
675000	679000	So he kept tight control over his own publicity.
679000	684000	Escher is going to come into the story, but this is the space Fuller was most interested in.
685000	697000	In terms of spear packing, what we call this CCP or FCC, or what he called IVM, isotropic vector matrix, which sounds kind of pretentious and long.
698000	704000	And so that's why people have a problem with Fuller is because he wrote everything almost, it's all in prose.
705000	708000	It's not looking, it doesn't look tightly mathematical.
709000	715000	It looks like somebody writing a lot of loquacious verbiage that's maybe not very high quality.
716000	718000	That's kind of what a lot of people's impression is.
719000	721000	But I decided now, let's really see what's here.
722000	723000	But you can see he's uncomfortable.
724000	732000	He's like that whiny kid or that rebellious kid in early elementary school when the teacher draws a dot on the chalkboard and says,
732000	737000	this is a point, but that's not really a point because point has no dimension.
738000	740000	And you can see this is really a pile of chalk.
741000	743000	So there's really the point you can't really see it.
744000	753000	And, you know, the kid raises their hand and it's like, so if I can't really see it, how do I know it's there or whatever they get into some stupid argument with the teacher, right?
753000	759000	And Fuller is like the guy who continues that argument, even into his 70s and 80s.
760000	764000	And he doesn't publish synergics until like 75 with the help of that Applewhite.
765000	769000	But he's like, he doesn't like this infinitely in planes, right?
770000	776000	And there's this guy, Carl Manger, I found the logical, not a logical positive, Vienna circle guy.
777000	781000	And he wrote this essay back when Einstein was treated more like a philosopher.
782000	786000	In those days, Einstein was looked up to and it's like, this is going to be a philosopher.
787000	789000	We're going to study Einstein and philosophy departments.
790000	791000	And that never really happened.
792000	794000	He's kind of in the physics department.
795000	797000	Philosophy took a different tack.
798000	803000	So you see in the title here, it's Albert Einstein, philosopher, scientist.
804000	808000	That's kind of like calling the Dalai Lama a scientist, which some people do, but it sounds weird, right?
808000	818000	So Geometry of Lumps, Carl Manger in this essay is saying Euclid's assumptions about points, lines and planes has this twofold idealization.
819000	823000	First, we don't talk about the extension of the dots or the thickness of the boards.
824000	829000	And also they all have to be infinite, or at least if they start to be long, I have to, you know what I mean, right?
830000	832000	So he's into infinity, which is fine.
833000	835000	And he's into infinity of smallness.
835000	839000	It's like with the infinite plane comes infinitely thin.
840000	841000	It's like one over infinity.
842000	843000	They're both there.
844000	846000	If you don't want that, what if you want a geometry of lumps?
847000	853000	And also here's pushback from Darcy Thompson writing in 1918 to Whitehead.
854000	857000	And he's having trouble with three dimensional.
858000	860000	And why are we saying three dimensional again for space?
860000	862000	Who came up with that?
863000	866000	And he has an alternative.
867000	870000	I would think it might be four dimensional coordinates.
871000	872000	We'll see about that.
873000	879000	And so Geometry of Lumps in Fuller, this is quoting from Synergetics, is very much lumpy.
880000	882000	He's like size is always special case.
883000	888000	But if you're talking about the eternal thing, it's metaphysical, whatever it's not special case.
888000	889000	It's timeless.
890000	892000	It's sub frequency means it only had shape.
893000	896000	You had frequency, you get size, you get energy involvement.
897000	900000	But if you're just talking about the shape of a thing, it's all about its angles.
901000	904000	And a tetrahedron is really simpler than a cube.
905000	906000	And it's been too overlooked.
907000	913000	He's kind of coming to Western civilization and saying, I see you went with the cube as your most important shape.
914000	916000	You got these platonics here on the table.
916000	917000	I like the cube.
918000	919000	But what about the tetrahedron here?
920000	921000	It's simpler.
922000	923000	It's got fewer vertices, all these things.
924000	925000	Why didn't you go with the tetrahedron?
926000	927000	What's your reason?
928000	931000	And, you know, that starts a discussion, I think that Fuller is triggering.
932000	939000	And so if I were to teach this for in high school to jump to the beginning of this show, I won't go through the whole thing.
940000	943000	I'm not going to plot through any of my shows from start to end.
943000	950000	Here, I would usually give some autobiography as well as biography about Fuller.
951000	955000	And then I would jump to the books and that's my cue.
956000	957000	Let's go to some other place.
958000	959000	Let's just talk a little bit of history.
960000	963000	How would I introduce Fuller today as an historical figure?
964000	965000	How would I do that?
966000	971000	I've shown you sort of connections to Abelwhite and Ezra Pound as kind of tenuous.
971000	973000	The Ezra Pound is a clue.
974000	975000	It's kind of a poet.
976000	977000	Fuller wanted to be seen as a poet.
978000	979000	You can find where he says that.
980000	983000	Then he plays a little language game, but you're not allowed to call yourself a poet.
984000	985000	Only other people can call you a poet.
986000	990000	So he's like, he cites e-comings and all this.
991000	992000	It's like, please, please, I'm a poet.
993000	996000	But, you know, it was kind of his revenge because he got expelled from Harvard a couple of times.
996000	1002000	But by the end of his life, he delivered the Charles Eliot Norton lecture.
1003000	1008000	And that's kind of a poetic position at Harvard.
1009000	1010000	Anyway, anyway.
1011000	1015000	So when I tell the story here on the lower left, that's Margaret Fuller.
1016000	1017000	And that's his great aunt.
1018000	1021000	And she's a contemporary of Ada Byron.
1022000	1025000	And I like to link the two, not that they ever met or anything,
1026000	1030000	but they were rethinking women who are a totally scholar.
1033000	1039000	I feel bad for Ada sometimes, but her dad was Lord Byron.
1040000	1043000	And they didn't want her to know until she was like 21.
1044000	1048000	And they take her into this room and they pull back this curtain.
1049000	1051000	And there's a portrait, and this is your father.
1051000	1054000	And she's like, whatever, teenager.
1055000	1056000	It makes a good movie.
1057000	1058000	Anyway, continue it.
1059000	1060000	There's Margaret Fuller.
1061000	1062000	See, she was an American Transcendentalist.
1063000	1064000	So you've got Emerson here.
1065000	1070000	This is a time when Harvard is turning from Unitarian to Transcendentalist.
1071000	1072000	You could put it that way.
1073000	1077000	With influence from Kant through Coleridge and people like that.
1077000	1083000	So it's a drift in American philosophy to become what we call Transcendentalist.
1084000	1085000	Nietzsche really admired Emerson.
1086000	1087000	Nietzsche lives later in time.
1088000	1089000	He's looking back.
1090000	1091000	And okay, so here's me.
1092000	1094000	I've thrown myself in on much older than that now.
1095000	1096000	That's my high school yearbook picture.
1097000	1098000	And this gentleman is Sam Lanahan.
1099000	1103000	And he turns out to be the grandson of Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald.
1104000	1107000	But he was really into tensegrity and stuff.
1108000	1112000	The buck he was into and actually went as a personal escort or sort of gopher,
1113000	1117000	chaperone, somebody to hang with when they went to the Philippines that time
1118000	1121000	as a guest of the Marcos family to Manila.
1122000	1126000	Fuller is flying around the world a lot by the time he's this age in this picture.
1127000	1129000	And the coincidence there, an interesting coincidence,
1129000	1134000	is I would have been a high school student in Manila right about that same time.
1135000	1137000	But I wasn't really tracking bucky then.
1138000	1142000	I hadn't gone to Princeton yet and therefore I hadn't read my Wittgenstein yet
1143000	1146000	and I didn't really get into the bucky stuff until after that anyway.
1147000	1152000	But I just wanted to give a little bit of my history and then comes that same slide
1153000	1154000	of Apooyte again.
1155000	1159000	And here we've got bucky with Ezra Pound towards the end of his life.
1160000	1162000	And if you know about Ezra Pound and his story,
1163000	1167000	he really felt he'd taken a wrong turn a few times because he ended up in prison, right?
1168000	1173000	He was put in a mental hospital for 11 years for the stuff he was saying on Italian radio
1174000	1175000	during World War II.
1176000	1179000	And he's like, well, if I'd been America, you would let me say it because I would have been protected.
1179000	1183000	But because I'm in Italy, a lot of people wanted him shot, right?
1184000	1185000	It was a very controversial time.
1186000	1191000	So I'm just taking you back to an older time that probably you don't know about,
1192000	1193000	forgotten about, whatever.
1194000	1196000	But Ezra Pound was very supportive of James Joyce,
1197000	1200000	this guy in the middle, Hugh Canary, he's a James Joyce scholar,
1201000	1203000	and kind of Fuller's crowd in a way.
1204000	1205000	Hugh kind of wrote a biography of Fuller.
1205000	1211000	So I'm trying to put Fuller in a literary circle instead of a science physics circle,
1212000	1214000	even though he totally admired Einstein, really looked up to Einstein,
1215000	1216000	want to get to that relationship in a minute.
1217000	1221000	And here we have Applewhite and Fuller in a famous picture on the right,
1222000	1227000	the Swab, Applewhite, and that's Donald Coxer in the middle.
1228000	1230000	I don't have his picture labeled or anything.
1231000	1233000	And this is Jeffrey Hinton on the left,
1234000	1236000	considered the father of machine learning by some,
1237000	1241000	the guy who quit Google not so long ago to warn us of the dangers of AI.
1242000	1244000	Both of these guys are from the University of Toronto in Canada.
1245000	1249000	Canada plays a really strong role in development of machine learning,
1250000	1251000	et cetera, artificial intelligence.
1252000	1253000	Sometimes I play up.
1254000	1259000	In fact, right now I'll play up kind of the tension then between this sort of imperialist American
1260000	1266000	minister Fuller, who has a patent on the geodesic dome and MC Escher's son,
1267000	1271000	who's immigrated to Canada and is thinking he wants to get into the dome business.
1272000	1273000	Now, where do I get the story?
1274000	1278000	It's from a published book by Siobhan Roberts called The King of Infinite Space,
1279000	1280000	and it's about Donald Coxeter.
1281000	1284000	He's also written a more recent bio of John Conway.
1284000	1291000	But in that Coxeter book, she talks about how Coxeter was living, angry.
1292000	1297000	When he found out that MC Escher's son was being frustrated about getting into the ray dome business,
1298000	1301000	in other words, building those domes across the Arctic Circle,
1302000	1304000	like smart young engineer maybe wants to get into that.
1305000	1308000	Oh, but the Pentagon buys all its bucky domes from bucky.
1309000	1312000	All those geodesic domes, there's a patent on that.
1312000	1316000	And Coxeter's like, how do you patent the geometry of nature?
1317000	1318000	You know, this stuff occurs naturally.
1319000	1321000	Geodesic domes, you can find them everywhere in nature.
1322000	1328000	And here's some American ego guy in the Pentagon who thinks he owns geodesic domes,
1329000	1330000	and he's not going to let MC Escher.
1331000	1336000	So, Coxeter develops a view of Fuller that he might not like Fuller.
1337000	1340000	And I'm saying this relationship evolves over time.
1340000	1348000	By the time Coxeter sees the Montreal Pavilion in 1967, he feels better about bucky.
1349000	1354000	It's like this really is beautiful architecture and this is a message of world peace and all this kind of stuff.
1355000	1357000	And their relationship continues to evolve.
1358000	1359000	But I'll never say it was very comfortable.
1360000	1366000	But I also want to say for the record that let me get to this important slide.
1366000	1371000	I'm going forward now through all this.
1372000	1377000	See, the content of Synergetics, just to alert you to that, is very geometric.
1378000	1381000	So, I'm calling it a philosophical work in the humanities.
1382000	1385000	I'm circling all that kind of stuff, as you've seen.
1386000	1392000	But then when we actually start looking at the pictures, at the figures, it's all very geometric, right?
1392000	1403000	And just what it's about is it's saying, I'd really like this tetrahedron embedded inside a cube to be my unit of volume.
1404000	1405000	I'd really like that.
1406000	1410000	But this is never going to happen because the cube we're embedded in is second root of two on the edge.
1411000	1416000	So, obviously, the whole volume of this cube is second root of two to the third power.
1417000	1418000	That's the volume of the cube.
1418000	1425000	And there's a well-known theorem that the tetrahedron inscribed in a cube is a third the volume of that cube, right?
1426000	1429000	That's just general proof to knowledge and geometry.
1430000	1435000	So, if you're ever going to have that tetrahedron be volume one, the cube has to have volume three.
1436000	1442000	And it clearly doesn't because the edges are second root of two and second root of two to the third power is second root of two to the third power.
1443000	1444000	It's some crazy irrational numbers.
1445000	1446000	So, what are you talking about, Mr. Buckingford?
1447000	1451000	Well, he's saying, I'm going to change the meaning of third and second power.
1452000	1457000	It's a growing tetrahedron that grows one eight twenty seven sixty four over here.
1458000	1463000	And so, when you raise something to the third power, picture a growing tetrahedron at that point.
1464000	1472000	And so, I'm going to grow my tetrahedron, this one inside here using this alternative model.
1472000	1475000	And therefore, my cube is going to have a different volume.
1476000	1481000	It's not going to be, we're no longer going to use the right angle to determine what we mean by third power.
1482000	1490000	And so, here you see a quote where he's saying school people all think of length, breadth and height as these three separate things.
1491000	1493000	Like, oh, I can imagine height without widths.
1494000	1495000	Oh, there's widths, no height.
1496000	1497000	Okay, swap them.
1498000	1499000	Okay, now there's height.
1500000	1501000	You know, what's the difference?
1501000	1505000	You really imagine them separately and floor is saying, no, let's not do that.
1506000	1512000	Let's just have one space to rule them all and let's have the tetrahedron be its icon and not the cube.
1513000	1516000	And it has four faces, very four, very pronounced four.
1517000	1519000	You can get three out of it by drawing z's along the edges and stuff.
1520000	1521000	One, two, three, you get a z.
1522000	1523000	Two z's make a tetrahedron.
1524000	1530000	There's your three dimensional intuition, but really, instead of going with the cube people, let's just start over, start fresh.
1531000	1533000	And have our tetrahedron be 40.
1534000	1541000	So when you come to synergetics, it's kind of like you're in search of the fourth dimension, but you're thinking 3d plus one, where's the fourth?
1542000	1544000	And in this world, you say, here's all four.
1545000	1549000	This is a four dimensional space, but you just can't keep your other three.
1550000	1551000	You're trading your car in for another car.
1552000	1554000	You're one, two, three, whatever, that's gone.
1555000	1556000	It's all 40.
1557000	1558000	It's all tetrahedron all the way down.
1559000	1560000	Everything's a tetrahedron, right?
1561000	1562000	That doesn't bring time into it.
1563000	1564000	We've got to have rotation.
1565000	1566000	We've got to have change.
1567000	1568000	But kind of an aesthetic sense.
1569000	1574000	When you do that, when your tetrahedron's unit volume, you're octahedron with the same edge length as volume four.
1575000	1578000	You're space filling rhombic donut and you're in this volume six.
1579000	1581000	Now that's with the long diagonal of each face.
1582000	1583000	The diamond faces, 12 of them.
1584000	1589000	They have long and short diagonals, crisscross, long diagonal, same as the edge of the tetrahedron volume six.
1589000	1591000	Now these ratios are all there in XYZ.
1592000	1593000	We're not changing the math.
1594000	1599000	These ratios are there, but they're not teased out because our unit volume is the cube.
1600000	1603000	And the cube does not play well with others compared to tetrahedron.
1604000	1606000	And there is the cube volume three.
1607000	1609000	So we have a different meaning of powering.
1610000	1611000	We have an alternative.
1612000	1613000	It's very alien.
1614000	1616000	So I call this Martian math sometimes when I teach it to kids.
1616000	1619000	So you just have a Martian saying, you never learned this in school, right?
1620000	1621000	But check it out.
1622000	1627000	So now that the tetrahedron is volume one, we can section it up to fractional tetrahedron.
1628000	1629000	There's one called the A module.
1630000	1634000	And then there's another one called the B module that sits on top of the A module.
1635000	1641000	And those two together, if you take the left and right A and add a left or right B,
1641000	1646000	you can make what's called the mite, which is a space spilling tetrahedron.
1647000	1649000	And you may have heard that tetrahedron don't fill space.
1650000	1656000	Well, that's true of the regular tetrahedron, but the various irregular tetrahedron do fill space.
1657000	1663000	And this is where Fuller overlaps with, I would say, everyday conventional math.
1664000	1669000	On the left side is a page out of a math journal, Journal of Pominentorial Theory.
1669000	1674000	And this is about, these are the plain nets of tetrahedron that do in fact fill space.
1675000	1681000	And along the bottom there are the names they would have if we were in the namespace of synergetics.
1682000	1687000	And the edges all match because edges don't tell you, I mean, you can expand it.
1688000	1689000	The shape is all that really matters here.
1690000	1705000	Okay, so the last thing back to the Quadrate coordinates is how do we support this intuition that space is four-dimensional with something like the XYZ coordinates.
1706000	1708000	So imagine you're in high school.
1709000	1711000	I'm talking to you and you've just learned a lot about XYZ.
1712000	1713000	I show you this jack.
1714000	1717000	You say, yeah, that's what we've been learning about the XYZ coordinate system.
1717000	1718000	Looks like a jack.
1719000	1723000	It's got the positive and negative of each of those three number lines, blah, blah.
1724000	1727000	And what we're using now over on the right is the Caltrop.
1728000	1731000	Instead, in a way, you see it's more economical.
1732000	1734000	The Scott Fewer spokes, after all, right?
1735000	1738000	I mean, everyone wants to say three-dimensional is the simplest world.
1739000	1744000	But when you look at the apparatus that comes with the XYZ, it's not as simple as the Caltrop.
1744000	1747000	So, you know, let's at least question it.
1748000	1749000	Let's take it out and check it out.
1750000	1751000	Let's go further.
1752000	1756000	So the thing is we can build the XYZ coordinates from the Quadrates.
1757000	1758000	It's not an either or a thing.
1759000	1765000	And that's the important aspect of all of this is that synergetics does not negate the old normal way of thinking.
1766000	1767000	XYZ is here to stay.
1768000	1769000	We're always going to have that.
1769000	1778000	I'd call it the Mahayana of math, the Hilbert space math, Euclidean math, the E that I talked about back in the beginning here.
1779000	1782000	So where are we in my talk, Quadrates?
1783000	1785000	I have Quadrates implemented in Python.
1786000	1790000	So students can download them and play with them interactively.
1791000	1795000	What that looks like using today's technology is something called Jupyter notebooks.
1795000	1798000	So here's like the source code for Quadrates.
1799000	1805000	And you have also source code for Tetraedrons, right?
1806000	1809000	I can express the vertices of Tetraedrons using Quadrate coordinates if I like.
1810000	1813000	Or I can convert back to XYZ doesn't matter.
1814000	1819000	Either way, I have lengths like distances and those are the same between XYZ and IBM coordinates.
1820000	1828000	But I changed how I compute volume because as you saw, my third powering is no longer your third powering.
1829000	1837000	When I say your, I mean XYZ people, you XYZ people, you use a cube to say third powering and you always say three cubes.
1838000	1841000	You don't stop to think that that could have been a Tetraedron at some point in history.
1842000	1843000	It's too late now.
1844000	1847000	Let's say synergetics will never be popular because we've already made our choice.
1847000	1848000	Let's put it that way.
1849000	1851000	But had we gone this route, what would it have been like?
1852000	1853000	What would the math have been like?
1854000	1855000	That's an interesting question to ask.
1856000	1859000	And so we changed the way we compute volume.
1860000	1861000	I'll show you quickly.
1862000	1867000	I take a well-known formula from history and one that's not known at all.
1868000	1871000	This guy named Piero della Francesca in the 1400s.
1871000	1879000	Just give me the six lengths of a Tetraedron and I'll give you back the volume through this complicated computation I'll do.
1880000	1881000	Just give me the lengths.
1882000	1883000	I'll give you the volume.
1884000	1885000	Same deal from Cayley Manger.
1886000	1887000	That's our same Manger.
1888000	1889000	This uses a determinant.
1890000	1895000	And same deal from Gerald DeJean, except nobody knows about this one and he's lost his derivation.
1895000	1896000	But I used it for years.
1897000	1905000	So I have these three different ways of taking the six edges of a Tetraedron and returning the volume in what are called Tetra volumes.
1906000	1916000	So we're no longer using unit cubes when we talk about what is the volume of X or Y or shape A and shape B.
1917000	1919000	We're talking about the Tetra volumes thereof.
1920000	1923000	So this slide deck is all about quadrates.
1923000	1924000	And they're used.
1925000	1928000	So this I'll leave it this picture and see if there's questions at this point.
1929000	1930000	So here.
1931000	1939000	Here we are using quadrate coordinates in the isotropic vector matrix, which has kind of a scaffolding role just like XYZ does.
1940000	1944000	And I'm saying two times two times five equals 20.
1945000	1946000	What do I mean by that?
1947000	1951000	I just take the tips of those three vectors two times two times five and close the lid.
1952000	1960000	I just, you know, add the fourth base and say that volume is equal to 20 of those little unit Tetraedrons.
1961000	1965000	Now you'll notice this whole scaffolding is not solely made of unit Tetraedrons.
1966000	1968000	It's a combination of Tetraedrons and octahedrons.
1969000	1971000	So I patented as the octet truss.
1972000	1975000	Again, the Imperial American patenting the geometry of nature, how dare he.
1976000	1980000	But what he was trying to show was, hey, I'm being pretty effective here.
1981000	1982000	My life to helping people.
1983000	1984000	And wow, I'm getting all these patents.
1985000	1986000	Wow, look at me.
1987000	1988000	I'm pretty cool.
1989000	1990000	So there's his side of it there too.
1991000	2000000	As to why he was so always trying to take credit for his thoughts because he was trying to prove a point, which is if you commit your life the way he did to serving all humanity.
2001000	2002000	And that's why he was different as a cold warrior.
2003000	2006000	He never really took the side of either the Russians or the Americans.
2007000	2009000	He's like, let me show you both how you can improve things.
2009000	2012000	And so, you know, that's a positive futurism.
2013000	2014000	He was a positive futurist.
2015000	2017000	And those are in high demand.
2018000	2025000	So to get real sophisticated, because you guys are math people, if you take a determinant, you just take the quadrace of four points in space.
2026000	2027000	So remember quadrace.
2028000	2031000	I don't think it's a Hilbert space because there's no right angles to the coordinates.
2032000	2033000	There's four tuples.
2033000	2034000	You lie them side down.
2035000	2039000	You lie them down the four coordinates, the four positions of any tetrahedron.
2040000	2042000	These are the four vertices of any tetrahedron.
2043000	2044000	Compute this determinant.
2045000	2051000	Take one fourth of that and you get your IBM volume, your tetrahedral volume of that state.
2052000	2057000	And interestingly, and I demonstrate this in Python for my high school audience.
2058000	2070000	If you pick any four spheres in a closest packed beer ocean, the IBM, pick any four spheres at random, connect them with the six edges and ask for the tetrahedron volume.
2071000	2072000	You always get a whole number.
2073000	2074000	Interesting.
2075000	2076000	And this slide I'm showing out.
2077000	2084000	Once you understand about quadrace, you can input the corners of what we call the A module shown in this picture.
2084000	2090000	There's the B module as quadrace, like the vertices are entered as quadrace.
2091000	2093000	And then we feed it to the formula I just showed you.
2094000	2096000	It constructs that determinant and computes the volume.
2097000	2098000	But the volume comes out what?
2099000	2103000	One twenty fourth because our unit of volume again is a tetrahedron.
2104000	2108000	You got to live in a world where the cube of unit edges does not have a rational volume.
2109000	2110000	Oh my God.
2111000	2112000	Oh my God.
2112000	2119000	So my view is, as a liberal Wittgenstein kind of guy, both these worlds coexist, namespaces coexist.
2120000	2128000	It's not a big deal that floors over here on the side with his subculture, evolving this whole different way of thinking and talking.
2129000	2131000	They use as a lot of the same words.
2132000	2134000	Because in the end, we all want to use the same words.
2134000	2142000	You'll find philosophers who say things like, if you don't mean what I mean by gravity B, then you should be saying schmavity, right?
2143000	2145000	We get to use the real word, right?
2146000	2151000	But what I'm saying in my slides here is we all want to use the word vector.
2152000	2157000	So what I have this little acronym is like everyone wants to rule the world.
2158000	2161000	None of us want to deny ourselves access to these key words.
2161000	2165000	And the way we solve that in Python is we create what are called namespaces.
2166000	2167000	They solved it in Java as well.
2168000	2174000	But it's a way to create sandboxes where we all get to use the same words, but we don't have to mean the same thing.
2175000	2177000	There's no one namespace to rule them all.
2178000	2179000	We didn't need that.
2180000	2181000	We don't have it.
2182000	2183000	Okay.
2184000	2185000	That ends my talk.
2186000	2190000	So in a way, y'all can ask anything.
2194000	2195000	I got the Cheshire cat in there.
2197000	2206000	The thing about dimensions is when we say they don't exist independently of each other, that's kind of the critique going back to that slide.
2208000	2210000	We're saying you can't have heights without depth.
2210000	2211000	Like, can you?
2212000	2219000	I mean, the book Flatland has been very, very, very influential and we convince ourselves that we can be two-dimensional in that.
2220000	2221000	But what is that really like?
2222000	2223000	Aren't you looking down?
2224000	2226000	If you're looking down on a square, you're in space.
2227000	2228000	You're looking down on a piece of paper.
2229000	2230000	So forget that.
2231000	2237000	You can't actually collapse what I call res extensa into two dimensions experientially.
2238000	2239000	This is what Fuller is saying.
2240000	2241000	Once.
2242000	2245000	And if you start from there, how does it get to be three and not four?
2246000	2253000	And so for it's an odd to feel that somebody would debate you that when you say space is three-dimensional, what we're used to is take that for granted.
2254000	2256000	We learned that in elementary school.
2257000	2264000	And now you have adults coming in the room and saying, well, we're going to say four-dimensional because we like to touch region more than the cube.
2265000	2266000	It's like, well, that's weird.
2266000	2267000	I'm not used to that.
2268000	2271000	But I would say, therefore, make it seem like an Asian thing.
2272000	2274000	I use a Sanskrit here, dependent origination.
2275000	2277000	All the dimensions are there at once.
2278000	2279000	You can't have one without the others.
2280000	2281000	There's no height without breadth.
2282000	2285000	Anyway, that's kind of the rhetoric you want to sample.
2286000	2290000	And what I'm saying is you don't have to give up on any of these.
2291000	2293000	You can always switch between them.
2294000	2295000	None of them are going anywhere.
2296000	2297000	Which is right?
2298000	2299000	Which camp am I in?
2300000	2301000	Do I have to be a champion of one or the other?
2302000	2303000	It's no.
2304000	2305000	I'd use machine learning.
2306000	2307000	I love the 3D stuff.
2308000	2309000	I teach that stuff.
2310000	2311000	So these are the three namespaces I'm talking about.
2312000	2313000	And just to recap the relationships.
2314000	2317000	Fuller really admired Einstein and wanted to write a book about Einstein.
2318000	2319000	Call it Nine Chases of the Moon.
2320000	2321000	And this is early.
2322000	2324000	Before the atomic bombs is before Oppenheimer.
2325000	2329000	And Einstein, everyone's endeared with this Einstein guy, including Fuller,
2330000	2331000	but it doesn't have the ominousness yet.
2332000	2336000	And Fuller writes kind of a lighthearted book called Nine Chases of the Moon,
2337000	2339000	which got Arthur C. Clark's attention at some point.
2340000	2343000	And they say to Fuller, look, you're nobody.
2344000	2345000	What are you writing about Einstein?
2346000	2347000	You've got to be a genius to write about Einstein.
2348000	2350000	There's about five people in the world who are allowed to write about Einstein.
2351000	2352000	Who do you think you are?
2352000	2356000	So Fuller took the, not to be so easily discouraged,
2357000	2358000	he sent his manuscript to Einstein.
2359000	2361000	And he got a call and he gets to go to Einstein.
2362000	2364000	And there's this play about Bucky Fuller.
2365000	2366000	It's a monologue play.
2367000	2370000	One actor does the whole thing with the scene where he's ushered in
2371000	2372000	and he gets to sit down with Einstein.
2373000	2374000	It's like Fuller is starstruck.
2375000	2376000	And Einstein is like, young man, you surprised me.
2377000	2381000	I never thought there'd be anything like practical or interesting to say about my work.
2382000	2383000	You know, in the everyday world.
2384000	2388000	But here you've shown blah, blah, and you have my blessing.
2389000	2392000	So Fuller got to be on the list of people who could write those kind of books.
2393000	2394000	It's not very technical.
2395000	2396000	It's, you know, Nine Chases of the Moon.
2397000	2400000	He admitted later he was drinking a lot of time when he wrote that.
2401000	2402000	But it's a really pretty interesting book.
2403000	2406000	So the relationship between Coxeter and Einstein.
2407000	2410000	I'm saying, given three people here, let's get to the relationships.
2410000	2420000	Coxeter is at pains in this quote to say, my way of doing 4D, extended Euclideanism,
2421000	2422000	is not the same as Einstein's.
2423000	2424000	Let's not confuse them.
2425000	2427000	And I don't think enough is done to help Coxeter make this point.
2428000	2433000	A lot of people would not identify extended Euclideanism with Coxeter in particular.
2434000	2436000	I mainly do that because University of Toronto,
2436000	2441000	but also because Fuller dedicates his synergetics to Coxeter.
2442000	2448000	So I've used that in my shot talk to use the name Coxeter is to stand for Gilbert space,
2449000	2453000	Euclidean extended Euclidean, any number of dimensions, whatever, ND geometry.
2454000	2459000	And he's saying this is not the same as what Einstein is doing with Minkowski space stuff like that.
2460000	2461000	So he's eager to make the distinction.
2461000	2465000	And what I'm saying is once you take him at his word that those two are different,
2466000	2470000	then you've realized that 4D can appear in these two whole different namespaces
2471000	2472000	and mean completely different things.
2473000	2478000	And that can be very confusing to a layperson if they've not encountered the doctrine of namespaces.
2479000	2481000	Now, thankfully, they're learning Python in droves.
2482000	2487000	It's getting easier for people to tease apart the fact that when I say vector or God or something,
2487000	2491000	it may not be in the same namespace as we're used to.
2492000	2497000	And then so once I've got room for two, it's easier to wedge in Fuller and say,
2498000	2499000	yeah, but he published late.
2500000	2501000	People didn't learn about him.
2502000	2504000	And so that's why he's very obscure.
2505000	2509000	And so you came to our very elite school in the Silicon Forest where we do teach this stuff.
2510000	2513000	We kind of make fun of other people who don't, right?
2514000	2516000	This is my bookshelves as current.
2517000	2519000	So I just took these pictures recently.
2520000	2525000	You can see I've got a little bit of category theory there with Chang's book.
2526000	2534000	You know, I'm studying that language because I kind of want to know how this can be translated into category theory.
2535000	2540000	The so-called beast modules, B-E-A-S-T, those are just tetrahedral wedges.
2541000	2543000	I've already shown you the A and the B. This is the S.
2544000	2550000	The S nestles between the octahedron of volume four and it's contained the icosahedron.
2551000	2555000	And their 24 S modules added to that icosahedron gives you the octahedron.
2556000	2559000	Again, this nesting relationship is not new with Bucky.
2560000	2566000	Bucky is basically saying, don't just throw the polyhedron out on a table unrelated to each other.
2566000	2571000	Their full didactic value comes from converging them into some kind of nest.
2572000	2574000	And a lot of people have that insight.
2575000	2578000	It's not enough to have polyhedra. You want to see how they relate to each other.
2579000	2582000	So we do that. We have this concentric hierarchy of polyhedra.
2583000	2585000	So there's the S modules in terms of a plane net.
2586000	2587000	Again, this is directly from Synergetics.
2588000	2593000	But when we compute the volume of it, we're not using standard XYZ math.
2593000	2597000	We're using what I showed you earlier. So there's the links.
2598000	2602000	And when I get out the volume, it's going to fit in our volumes table.
2603000	2605000	And we can express that volume.
2606000	2611000	The volume in the tetra volumes of the S module is five to the negative fifth over two.
2612000	2615000	So we have a very five based, very interesting.
2616000	2618000	There's the S module 3D printed by up.
2619000	2621000	That's S and then edges expanded by five.
2621000	2623000	So volume up to the third power.
2624000	2626000	So the beast modules is where we are.
2627000	2631000	And here's our volumes table overall, right?
2632000	2637000	So the tetraegrin is one and I'm using very high precision, not just floating points.
2638000	2640000	And I'm using actual algebraic expressions out on the right.
2641000	2643000	So our icosahedron is valued differently.
2644000	2649000	All the volumes have a different value, but there's a constant ratio between them called the Synergetics constant.
2650000	2653000	So when you go from the XYZ world to the IBM world,
2654000	2657000	all the changes is somehow the model of third powering.
2658000	2661000	And then all your volumes shift, but by a constant value.
2662000	2664000	So it's really very, very simple.
2665000	2667000	This is not tough stuff.
2668000	2671000	That's partly why it can fly in and say high school level.
2672000	2676000	But there might be a way to introduce category theory, let these modules,
2676000	2679000	these wedges morph into each other.
2680000	2681000	The A turns into the B.
2682000	2685000	These A, B, and T, by the way, all have the same volume, one over 24.
2686000	2687000	And then there's the E and the S.
2688000	2692000	Those are the four of five modules, tetraegrin wedges that we study.
2693000	2699000	Once we've absorbed a little paradigm of unit volume, tetraegrin, concentric hierarchy, like that,
2700000	2703000	then we break the tetraegrin into pieces, shatter some other stuff.
2703000	2707000	And we get these vocabulary of five basic wedges.
2708000	2712000	And I kind of showed you how two of them, the A and the B, can be used to make the mites,
2713000	2719000	which is one of the space-filling tetrahedra, known to conventional XYZ math world,
2720000	2721000	but by a different name.
2722000	2724000	Well, it's a lot about nomenclature.
2725000	2727000	Who dares to call the A module an A module?
2728000	2732000	And can we call it something else if we're not interested in getting fuller's names?
2733000	2740000	And in further circulation, we must stop use of A to mean this A module and so forth.
2741000	2742000	Thank you, Kirby.
2743000	2744000	Yep.
2745000	2746000	Shanna or Dean, go for it first.
2750000	2751000	Dean, go first.
2752000	2753000	You want me to go?
2754000	2757000	Okay, yeah, Kirby, just thank you so much for that incredible talk.
2757000	2762000	Yeah, we could start some categorical, synergetical, you know, bankings.
2763000	2764000	I had a question.
2765000	2767000	If you go back to the geometry of lumps slide.
2768000	2769000	Sure.
2770000	2771000	Where that was.
2772000	2775000	Just have to make the right slide that.
2776000	2777000	Yeah.
2778000	2779000	I'm almost there.
2780000	2781000	That one.
2782000	2783000	Let's see.
2784000	2787000	More with a systematic character of prime thinkability.
2788000	2789000	Where's that one?
2790000	2791000	This one.
2793000	2797000	Yeah, we have the actual like 1071.00, the kind of fuller slide.
2798000	2799000	Fuller slide, got it.
2800000	2801000	Okay.
2802000	2803000	This one.
2806000	2809000	Yeah, it says geometry of lumps in the first.
2809000	2810000	Okay, I got you.
2811000	2812000	Prime thinkability.
2813000	2814000	No, you're right on.
2815000	2816000	Totally good memory.
2817000	2818000	Very cool.
2819000	2820000	All right.
2822000	2823000	No, I know that's not it.
2825000	2826000	Let's just go one by one.
2828000	2829000	I can tell you ask it without the thing.
2830000	2831000	Yeah.
2832000	2833000	Cool.
2834000	2838000	Since you're like, you know, fuller expert, I want to ask,
2839000	2844000	the systematic realization slide where he says all imaging
2845000	2846000	derives from experience.
2847000	2849000	So since we're sitting here talking about math art fronts,
2850000	2854000	I want to know what you think that, what do you think that is?
2855000	2856000	What you think he's doing with that?
2857000	2858000	Could you have an image without an experience?
2859000	2861000	Because he's adding frequency to what he calls the,
2862000	2866000	you know, mathematical, undemonstrable something.
2866000	2869000	So just wondering what you, what's your take on all imaging
2870000	2871000	derives from experience?
2873000	2874000	Well,
2877000	2882000	I think if we took away what you couldn't get from experience,
2883000	2885000	like we can extrapolate from experience.
2886000	2891000	We like, people say I can experience a perfect circle and then you close
2892000	2894000	your mind or close your eyes and say, I'm doing it right now.
2894000	2896000	I'm now picturing a perfect circle.
2897000	2899000	And it's like, there's no one really there to contradict you
2900000	2902000	or there's no peer review in that sense.
2903000	2905000	I'm thinking he means public.
2906000	2910000	He means we all get our private authority from shared public space.
2911000	2914000	So if you think you see something that's totally non experiential,
2915000	2917000	how are you going to communicate it?
2918000	2920000	And at some point it becomes experiential.
2920000	2925000	It's like our experience in math is very strong, right?
2926000	2930000	It's not like we don't feel and sense, right?
2931000	2932000	So that's experiential too.
2933000	2938000	So when I say experiential, it's not about discounting other than visualization,
2939000	2941000	which he associates, by the way, with Euler.
2942000	2945000	He associates the spatial visual imaginary.
2945000	2950000	You could call that Eulerian and just for fun to try that on.
2951000	2954000	And then the visceral, like when you just tactile feel,
2955000	2959000	like your emotions, you can almost say that he associates with Gibbs,
2960000	2965000	tactile, vectorial energy flows of that kind of being on a roller coaster.
2966000	2967000	Visceral sense.
2968000	2969000	Anyway, just extrapolating.
2970000	2972000	It's a language, partly why it's two volumes.
2972000	2976000	And there's also a synergetics dictionary for volumes,
2977000	2980000	all done with help from Avaloy who would collate everything Bucky said,
2981000	2986000	because he did have, I would say, kind of unmoored meanings for his words,
2987000	2990000	not just frequency, not just what you're reading here,
2991000	2993000	but when he talks about radiation and gravity,
2994000	2998000	it's like you say, wait a minute, this is your own private language, isn't it?
2998000	3000000	And in a way, yeah, in a way it is.
3001000	3002000	That's partly it.
3003000	3004000	Yeah, Daniel.
3004000	3007000	Yeah, on that quote, just a few possible active inference connections,
3008000	3009000	all imaging derives from experience.
3010000	3012000	So that's kind of like the projective consciousness
3013000	3015000	or the screen type visualizations that we've been discussing.
3016000	3020000	And then also the next line, I think points towards cognitive modeling,
3021000	3026000	because it's saying, you can abstract, you can abstract to negative dimensions,
3026000	3030000	zero, one, two, three, you can think slash do anything.
3031000	3036000	However, that experience will be a cognitive systematic situation.
3037000	3041000	So that's kind of an embodied or a historical approach to math operations,
3042000	3047000	which is like, yes, a mathematician can imagine an infinitesimal
3048000	3050000	as the basis of continuity in a line, they can,
3051000	3054000	and they're not wrong within that namespace world.
3055000	3060000	However, that is happening on the organism's cognitive interface.
3064000	3069000	I think because of my Wittgenstein background, again, later Wittgenstein,
3070000	3076000	it's not required for a term to be meaningful for it to have a reference
3077000	3078000	so that it actually points to something.
3079000	3081000	So you can have a language that's chock full of meaning.
3081000	3083000	And yet it doesn't really point to anything.
3084000	3085000	And I take my analogy of driving a car.
3086000	3090000	The steering wheel is as much part of the language game as the signage,
3091000	3094000	the striped lines, everything about the road.
3095000	3098000	In fact, where language begins and everything else ends, there is no line.
3099000	3103000	So it's all just, you know, language, you could say the whole car, everything.
3104000	3107000	And that's kind of an operational deal of language.
3107000	3114000	And in that sense, I don't say, well, you know, really the job is to line up
3115000	3116000	your words with the essence of things.
3117000	3121000	You know, that's kind of the Western metaphysics is if we dig down deep enough,
3122000	3126000	we'll find the essence of the word logic or the essence of the word dimension.
3127000	3128000	And it's our job to find that.
3129000	3133000	And in the Wittgenstein sense, no, it's our job to create language games
3134000	3136000	that hold together until they don't, right?
3137000	3142000	It's like name spaces come and go like sand castles on the beach, right?
3143000	3147000	It's like, it's not necessary to decide which one is quote true, right?
3148000	3149000	They're forms of life.
3150000	3153000	So that's why I'm thinking when I talk about these branches and different uses
3154000	3158000	of the word dimension and so on, I'm saying, you know, there's friendships here.
3159000	3160000	Coxeter and Bucky ended up being friends.
3161000	3163000	Einstein and Bucky admired each other.
3164000	3165000	I'm sure Coxeter admired Einstein.
3165000	3170000	There's nothing to keep us as human beings from jumping around between these,
3171000	3176000	but it's a little difficult to do because of the required gestalt shifts
3177000	3181000	when you jump from say XYZ apparatus into IVM coordinates
3182000	3186000	and go from three tuples to four tuples is going to be jarring, right?
3187000	3188000	But then after a while it gets smooth, right?
3189000	3194000	I think it helps understand XYZ to jump into quadrace, for example.
3195000	3198000	I don't see them as, I don't see one as hurting the other.
3199000	3201000	I see them as two APIs to the same means.
3202000	3206000	And what I didn't show just real quick is once we are using quadrace,
3207000	3212000	we can get whole number coordinates for all the spheres and closest packing.
3213000	3214000	So I start with a nuclear ball.
3214000	3218000	I do a layer of 12 around it, a layer of 42 around that,
3219000	3221000	another layer of 92, another layer of 162.
3222000	3225000	As I grow this outward, creating the CCP,
3226000	3230000	I can just use 12 permutations of my original basis vectors.
3231000	3233000	In other words, once you start with a quadrace,
3234000	3237000	take two of one, one of any other two and none of a third or fourth
3238000	3242000	and do all 12 permutations of that and you now have the hops you need
3242000	3246000	to the neighboring spheres around the sphere you're in, the 12 around one.
3247000	3251000	And linear combinations of those directions, therefore on the right you see
3252000	3257000	all whole number integer, positive integer addressing for CCP space,
3258000	3260000	whereas in XYZ we don't have it, it's not that nice.
3261000	3263000	So there are practical uses for this.
3264000	3269000	I would say graphic arts people really need to know about the concentric hierarchy.
3269000	3277000	Adding quadrace, for example, if you just add triples of quadrace,
3278000	3280000	you get the opposite tetrahedron, right?
3281000	3284000	You get the inverse intersected dual, the tetrahedron's dual of itself.
3285000	3289000	You can get the cubes vertices from the quadrace
3290000	3292000	because you've got the dual tetrahedron.
3293000	3294000	So those two together make a cube.
3295000	3296000	Same octetron rhombic data.
3297000	3298000	In other words, this diagram on the right says it all.
3299000	3305000	A through Z, all those points can be reached with very simple sums of the quadrace.
3306000	3310000	And I feel like when we jump into the swimming pool, we come out smarter
3311000	3313000	and we're better able to understand XYZ as well.
3314000	3317000	Thank you, Kirby. Dean and Jim.
3320000	3321000	Well, thanks, Daniel.
3322000	3326000	I have a question for you around.
3327000	3331000	It's a bit of a fork from some of the stuff that you have in the slides here.
3332000	3339000	I'm wondering around the learning aspect of four-dimensional awareness
3340000	3342000	and understanding and acknowledgement.
3344000	3346000	There are a lot of relationships out there.
3346000	3352000	I'm sure I have a relationship with the fish swimming around in the lake in front of my cabin right now,
3353000	3357000	but I don't necessarily acknowledge that until I bump into them or whatever.
3358000	3364000	And I think in a lot of learning centers on what we choose to acknowledge
3365000	3367000	and what we just ignore or it's put in the background, right?
3368000	3370000	So this isn't a, we're all related.
3371000	3372000	We're all one kind of thing.
3372000	3378000	Of course we are, but the learning is in what matters in that particular situation or context
3379000	3383000	in which we're trying to expand or maybe contract our model, right?
3384000	3393000	So my question is around the idea that the synergetics forks off of relativity
3393000	3400000	or still in that relationship forward dimension
3401000	3404000	and less Bucky the savior and more Bucky the man
3405000	3411000	by not taking a math or art, i.e. a Cold War side as relationship,
3412000	3414000	was Bucky a bit of a turd-disturber?
3418000	3420000	What was that? A turd-disturber?
3420000	3423000	Yeah, I'm trying to be, I'm trying to be polite, Kirby.
3424000	3429000	I think he was a maverick and he did stir the pot and he was controversial
3430000	3437000	and he caused a lot of, still to this day, all kinds of controversy swirling around fuller.
3438000	3444000	I think the only way to explain why something as straightforward and interesting as I just went through
3445000	3453000	is so esoteric and unknown has to be more than just, oh, I'm going to ignore it.
3454000	3455000	I think no, I'm going to actively suppress it.
3456000	3463000	I'm not saying you, I'm just saying Fuller felt this himself that he was going to be forgotten in a hurry
3464000	3467000	and I think it was partly because of that way he played the Cold War.
3468000	3472000	He was not taking sides and that doesn't make you popular even today, right?
3472000	3477000	So he had enemies, detractors.
3478000	3482000	And like Kenneth Snelson, if you're into the lore, you know, about that rival where he just real quick,
3483000	3489000	I think people need to deal with my story more and I've got, you know, I've got, this could seem self-serving,
3490000	3493000	but I get more into where I put myself in the picture here.
3494000	3499000	Kaufman, Rorty, stuff like that, bits into Bucky stuff.
3499000	3502000	I'm saying I was Kenneth Snelson's first webmaster.
3503000	3506000	I was also the Buckmaster Fuller's first webmaster.
3507000	3509000	So like here we are in the next generation.
3510000	3514000	If you want to write about another book about synergetics, you should talk to me, right?
3515000	3519000	Because there's all these books coming out still where they don't even mention the beast modules.
3520000	3524000	And my feeling is the boomers skipped Bucky.
3524000	3529000	Like they went to his lectures and they applauded and, oh, nice pat on the head, you're a good guy.
3530000	3536000	You want the world to be a better place, but we're not going to pay any attention to the mathematics.
3537000	3541000	And I'm one of the boomers, but I'm telling downline generations.
3542000	3544000	I think my fellow boomers made a mistake.
3545000	3546000	This was worth keeping.
3547000	3549000	And I think my downliners get that.
3550000	3553000	So this art by Casey House is not by me, but we're going to have a good culture.
3554000	3562000	Cultural renaissance as people recover the damage done by the boomers.
3563000	3565000	So can I just do a quick follow up?
3566000	3571000	Of course, you're looking at things as math art and we are not picking sides.
3572000	3577000	Should we anticipate that there are going to be a whole bunch of people out there who are going to bounce on this and hate?
3581000	3582000	No.
3585000	3588000	No, I don't think I think we're past that now.
3589000	3592000	That might have been true at one point, but I don't think we're in that time.
3593000	3596000	I think this stuff will smoothly gain traction.
3597000	3601000	But in general, though, I do think art isn't neutral.
3602000	3611000	In other words, propagandists on all sides use the tools of art to persuade art as a tool of persuasion, as well as just isn't this pretty.
3611000	3617000	So, you know, I pay attention to that.
3618000	3621000	But I think Fuller's stuff right now is in good shape.
3622000	3624000	Like we're not worried, right?
3625000	3626000	Maybe at one point.
3627000	3629000	But this stuff, you know, I get to teach this.
3630000	3631000	I'm online a lot.
3632000	3633000	People love it.
3634000	3635000	It's like I'm not having much push back.
3636000	3640000	So if that answers it all, like I'm not encountering any vicious anger.
3641000	3642000	Myself.
3644000	3645000	As I push forward.
3646000	3647000	Seems like the coast is clear.
3648000	3649000	Come on in the water is fine.
3650000	3652000	And we need more math talent or art talent.
3653000	3654000	Like Casey House here.
3655000	3656000	I can't do anything quite this pretty.
3657000	3658000	My animations.
3659000	3666000	It's not like it's just me, but like I sense a lack of good computer graphics still around a lot of this stuff.
3669000	3670000	So I'm recruiting.
3671000	3672000	I'm just trying to make sure that I'm in good shape mode.
3673000	3678000	Hey, if you're listening and you want to help bring your art skills over here and help us, that kind of thing.
3679000	3682000	Keep our 4D alive in this lineage, right?
3683000	3684000	I love all of these.
3685000	3686000	They're all good.
3687000	3688000	I didn't put S ahead for any reason.
3689000	3690000	I wasn't trying to mean anything.
3691000	3692000	Just trying to make room here.
3693000	3695000	And I'm not saying these are the only branches or anything like that.
3696000	3697000	Just saying here's a triangle we can make.
3698000	3699000	You can forget about synergetics.
3699000	3702000	It's not important if you want to take, there'll be enough people.
3703000	3708000	So if you don't want to jump on the boat, don't feel coerced is another message while I have the floor.
3714000	3715000	Thank you.
3716000	3719000	Again, it's not either or I'm a teacher of ordinary XYZ math a lot, right?
3720000	3721000	As a calculus teacher.
3722000	3726000	So quickly, like I grew up in Portland, Oregon, my dad's an urban planner.
3726000	3731000	But he always wants to work overseas, not in the highly developed first world, so to speak.
3732000	3738000	He's trained as a PhD planner at the University of Chicago, wants to work overseas and quote developing countries.
3739000	3747000	So even though we were settling down in Portland, Oregon for a cushy middle class lifestyle, when the call came, how'd you like to work in Libya?
3748000	3749000	He's like, yeah, that's what I'm for.
3750000	3751000	Let's go.
3751000	3756000	Now that turned out to be cushy anyway, because the family gets to live in Italy and Rome.
3757000	3762000	So I grew up in Rome through eighth grade, go to high school in the Philippines, go to Princeton East Coast for a while.
3763000	3764000	And now I'm back in Portland, Oregon.
3765000	3766000	So I'm kind of expat.
3767000	3769000	And my dad was freelance.
3770000	3773000	So sometimes he worked for the US government and sometimes not.
3774000	3778000	He was on the payroll of the Egyptians when they lived in Cairo for years.
3778000	3784000	So after I left the family ship, as I say, they were in the Philippines, I go to Princeton, they keep moving around.
3785000	3787000	So my parents live in Cairo for many years.
3788000	3790000	They end up in Bhutan in the Himalayas.
3791000	3793000	And I go stay with them there for many years.
3794000	3796000	So I have an interesting bio.
3797000	3802000	I play that card like I want people to use my like we use Bucky's life.
3803000	3804000	Bucky knew a lot of people.
3805000	3806000	He was very gregarious.
3807000	3809000	And he didn't mind writing letters to whoever.
3810000	3815000	So a new book about Bucky called Inventor of the Future by Alec Navalou Lee.
3816000	3817000	I see we're about at time here.
3818000	3819000	So let me just end.
3820000	3821000	It's a really good bio.
3822000	3823000	And Alec is kind of a skeptic.
3824000	3826000	He's not an acolyte.
3827000	3829000	He's not doing hagiography for Bucky.
3830000	3832000	This book is a skeptical look at Bucky.
3832000	3833000	And I think that's fine.
3834000	3839000	What it really shows, though, is how you can use this life as a guidebook to the 20th century.
3840000	3842000	And a lot of intellectual history will unfold.
3843000	3849000	So I guess what I'm saying is I thank the mathematicians for looking in on what we're doing.
3850000	3854000	But a lot of what I'm doing here is prepping kids in American history.
3855000	3860000	Right. They need to know transcendentalists, how it goes towards Bucky and, you know, all this stuff's literature.
3860000	3862000	Whether you get it in math class or not.
3863000	3864000	But I'd like you to get it in math class.
3865000	3866000	And I'd like math class to use Python.
3867000	3871000	Because I don't think we should be teaching math without a computer.
3872000	3873000	But that's just me.
3874000	3875000	I have a whole other stick on that.
3876000	3877000	Thank you, Kirby.
3878000	3879000	Jim, last question.
3880000	3881000	Thanks, Kirby, for the talk.
3882000	3883000	And I want to ask you a question.
3884000	3887000	So if tetrahedron is the basis unit for our 4D system,
3887000	3890000	then what do you think the 5D system will be?
3891000	3892000	Or even higher dimension?
3893000	3894000	That's a great question.
3895000	3902000	In Fuller's own synergetics, and this is partly why I say he branches off Einstein more than off of Coxeter
3903000	3904000	or off of extended Euclideanism,
3905000	3907000	is Fuller immediately turns to talk of time.
3908000	3911000	When he considers fifth dimension, sixth dimension,
3912000	3915000	he does want the word dimension to continue to do work in his synergetics.
3916000	3920000	And he's got lots of passages using that word.
3921000	3923000	At one point, though, there's a passage where he says,
3924000	3926000	this word dimension I'm paraphrasing is just too slippery.
3927000	3928000	I'm not going to use it anymore.
3929000	3930000	I'm going to use the word power.
3931000	3932000	And then he starts doing stuff with power right after that.
3933000	3934000	And that's a very interesting passage.
3935000	3939000	But he has what I call New Year's resolutions in his writing where he resolves pounds of table.
3940000	3941000	I'm never going to say polyhedron again.
3942000	3944000	It's going to be polyvertexion from now on.
3945000	3946000	Yeah, right.
3947000	3948000	New Year's resolution.
3949000	3956000	But your question is, tell me again if the tetrahedron is the basis.
3957000	3960000	Yeah, what would be the fifth dimension?
3961000	3967000	For you guys, let me say you guys in a, I don't mean to box you in,
3968000	3971000	but as Hilbert space extended Euclideans,
3972000	3973000	because this is a path you're on.
3973000	3976000	After this talk, your talks will continue on that path, I think.
3977000	3979000	What's a 4D tesseract?
3980000	3982000	In other words, what's a tetrahedron in 4D?
3983000	3984000	I do the same thing I do with a cube, right?
3985000	3988000	I draw a smaller one inside a bigger one and connect the corners.
3989000	3990000	And what do I call that?
3991000	3994000	If a tesseract is a 4D cube, what do I call a 4D tetrahedron?
3995000	3999000	And why XYZ people isn't that tetrahedron important to you?
3999000	4001000	In other words, you really into that tesseract.
4002000	4005000	Why not the tetrahedron and its 4D version?
4006000	4007000	What does it look like?
4008000	4009000	Why don't you talk about that more?
4010000	4011000	Because the tetrahedron is clearly simpler than the cube.
4012000	4013000	You're way too into the cube.
4014000	4016000	That's, you know, coming from an alien way out their view.
4017000	4023000	Thank you, Kirby, Dean, Jim, Shanna.
4024000	4025000	Been fun.
4026000	4027000	All right.
4027000	4030000	I hope you guys all stay in touch and we keep working on this.
4031000	4032000	We need help.
4033000	4034000	Thank you.
4035000	4036000	Thanks, Kirby.
4037000	4038000	Till Math Art 5.
4039000	4040000	Thank you.
4057000	4058000	Thank you.
