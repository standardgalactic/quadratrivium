Hello, and welcome, everyone. This is Active Inference, guest stream 77.1. We're here

2
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:21,640
with Gareth Stubbs, going to be discussing the police hunch. So, Gareth, thank you very

3
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:29,360
much for joining. Looking forward to your presentation and the discussion we'll have.

4
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,840
Thank you so much for having me, Daniel, and it's an absolute pleasure to be on the stream,

5
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,000
one that I've watched many times, and it's a privilege to be able to talk through the

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,200
paper. I'm hoping to give you a little bit of background as to why I wrote the paper,

7
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:49,600
where I've come from, a little bit of history, talk through the paper itself, and then hopefully

8
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,320
take some interesting questions, if there's anybody watching, or from Daniel himself,

9
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:03,120
who's always got some very insightful questions to ask. So, if you're all right, Daniel, am I okay to

10
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:10,520
start and get going? Yeah, okay. So, a little bit of background. So, I'm a relatively new

11
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:17,240
academic. I was a police officer for 18 years in the UK. I was in a Northern English force,

12
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:25,000
and during my career, I did a wide range of stuff from like frontline emergency response,

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,440
blue lights, to community policing, which is building relationships with the community,

14
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:37,080
gathering intelligence, and then working on long term problem solving. Through to working in

15
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:43,160
national strategy, I worked for the College of Policing, and more latterly, the home office,

16
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:48,760
the inspectorate. And the inspectorate was an organisation where we would inspect police officers

17
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:54,840
and make sure that the standards of policing and how they recorded and monitored and all that was

18
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:02,040
up to a particular level. And for the last five years of my policing career, I was studying a

19
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:09,160
part-time PhD on the side, and you would think, with me having written this paper, it would be a

20
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:17,800
police decision making or similar, and it wasn't. I actually studied using two theories, which were

21
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,200
representative bureaucracy and social embeddedness, and it was actually about how

22
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:29,000
new police recruits navigated the police recruitment process via the use of their

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,440
social networks. It sounds complicated and convoluted, and it was essentially spent a lot of time

24
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:42,440
trying to figure out how people gained advantage or disadvantage through their current social networks

25
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:51,160
whilst trying to get into the police, with the hope of figuring out why our recruitment process

26
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:58,520
was so discriminatory. And I've been working on publishing from that PhD, I've only just finished

27
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:04,920
actually, over the last maybe two, three years, whereupon I went out to the Middle East to teach

28
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:10,280
police officers now. There's two people that I want to discuss during this stream, the first being

29
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:16,120
two different groups of people, the first one being Professor Friston, who was just amazing

30
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:22,840
when I contacted him, and the other being two very well known criminologists called Ken Pease

31
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:33,640
and Jason Roche. And this entire lane or path of study came out of a discussion with them,

32
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:39,800
because I was talking about very strange decision making that you make while in service.

33
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,280
So you make decisions that other people look at and say, oh, that's a very strange decision,

34
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,080
why did that police officer make that decision? But when you speak to the officer, they're often

35
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:55,400
able to relate quite a complicated series of past experiences that have led to the decision

36
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:01,720
that they've made. And it was Ken Pease, who's, again, a very well known criminologist who said

37
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:07,080
to me, look, you need to read about the Bayesian brain. He said, what you're describing is how

38
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:16,760
the Bayesian brain works. So he set me on this kind of down the rabbit hole journey, if you like,

39
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:22,120
and did a lot of reading of the foundational papers around the Bayesian brain, which I found

40
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,840
very complicated because I didn't have a background in mathematics or neuroscience or cognitive

41
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:33,320
science. So it was kind of like jumping in the deep end. But he recommended a really good

42
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:38,760
book called Super Forecasters by Tetlock. Some of you may have heard of it, some of you may not

43
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:45,240
have heard about it, but it's essentially the human art of prediction, like how intuition is made

44
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:53,800
in the Bayesian brain. And I found the book revelatory because when I look back at my police

45
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,280
experience, I could see the development of my Bayesian brain as time went on and how my decision

46
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:03,080
making changed. And this was like kind of mixed because we all have our backgrounds and our history.

47
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:10,120
But when I was at the home office in London, and we were looking at the way that police forces were

48
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,400
organized and governed and all that sort of thing, we could see that there was a general

49
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:21,720
tendency towards this kind of promotion of the generalist. So a lot of your senior managers

50
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,400
seem to have been able to like bounce around the organization. They've done lots of different

51
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:30,440
things. Some have been detectives, some have been uniforms, some have been in corporates,

52
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:35,480
some have been firearms. You had all these different kind of disciplines, if you like.

53
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:42,600
You ended up with a lot of senior leaders who were jack of all trades and essentially

54
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:49,160
masters of none. And this was in direct contrast to a lot of the research that looked at teams

55
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,960
of specialists, people with specialist knowledge that have built up very, very solid, what you

56
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:58,200
could call like Bayesian building blocks when it comes to specialist decision making. And then

57
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:02,200
when you put them together, the matching of all these specialisms then resulted in higher

58
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:06,920
performance of external private companies. So we were trying to think about how this might

59
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:12,840
look in policing. And it was only when I wrote a read super forecasting solid blocks of prediction

60
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:20,840
that I started to understand how the brain may work. Now, of course, if you at any point go into

61
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,920
YouTube and you type in the Bayesian brain, you're going to get Professor Friston in some way.

62
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:32,840
So that was my first introduction. And this was probably about two years ago. And I absolutely

63
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:41,240
devoured all of his podcasts. I mean, everything that I could find. And that kind of linked in a

64
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:46,360
lot with the LLM development. Obviously, we have the side by side active inference seem to be like

65
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:52,040
picking up steam like crazy. And then we have the LLMs and the AI research picking up steam.

66
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:56,120
And then you could see how the two were starting to like twist and merge. And there were some really

67
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:04,440
good podcasts from Machine Learning Street Talk and Curt Jaimungles podcast theory of everything.

68
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,960
Well, we're talking really long form like two and a half, three hour discussions on this stuff.

69
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:18,600
And I was just absolutely immersed. And I started to think about how this has never been used in

70
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:23,560
practice like in policing, you know, like, a lot of the time we go to these training sessions,

71
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,640
you'd have some experienced practitioners talking to you about how they made decisions.

72
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:32,200
We'd have decision making models and me with my relatively new academic brain was immediately

73
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,880
going straight to Google scholar and saying, okay, what's the empirical basis for these

74
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:41,000
decision making models? I know everyone's using them. But do we know if they work? Do we know if

75
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,120
they speed up our decision making? Are they better with those who've got better Bayesian

76
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:51,240
building blocks? Are they not better? So when you start to look at these questions, you realize that

77
00:07:52,040 --> 00:08:00,200
there's almost no research to support police decision making models. And the best stuff

78
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:05,800
that I found on that is in Andy Clark book, and the experience machine as a full chapter

79
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:11,880
on looking at police decision making. Anyway, I'm getting slightly distracted. How did I actually

80
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:19,880
come to the paper? So there was one experience in my service. And I'm going to tell the story

81
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:26,520
because it's in the paper. If that's all right, Daniel, is that okay? Okay. So I was a

82
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,720
newly promoted sergeant. And that's like a first line supervisor in the police. I had a team of

83
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:39,480
about 15 police officers. And I was probably about 27, 28 years old. And I was out with one of those

84
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:45,000
police officers who was new. And he was trying to build his confidence. So I said to him, look,

85
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:51,320
Jamie, I said, we're going to go to all the bad stuff tonight. So when the nasty incidents come

86
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,160
in, we're going to go and I'm going to see if I can work with you on building your confidence in

87
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:59,400
these sort of like, you know, these, these high risk situations. And he was all up for it.

88
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:07,320
And then domestic violence incident came in and the male offender was still inside the

89
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:12,120
house. And we knew that they've been violent shoes because the person who rang it in was a

90
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:18,120
neighbor. And the neighbor had said that she was severely injured and bleeding. So because there

91
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:23,080
was a chance that it could get rough, and we might need to make an arrest straightaway,

92
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:28,680
I thought this would be good for Jamie to go to. And he was a Taser officer. And I don't know how,

93
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:33,800
how like, experienced you guys are. So I'll just let you know, but police officers in

94
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:38,600
England, we don't carry guns like, and there's probably about five or 6% of police officers

95
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:44,040
that carry guns at the most. And a lot of them are only sent to incidents that may involve firearms.

96
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:52,120
So the vast majority of incidents we go to, we have a baton, she's like a stick, and a spray.

97
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:57,560
And they're the, they're the two bits that we've got to deal with it. Now Jamie had just got his

98
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:04,120
Taser, and he was trying to build his confidence. And so we turned up, there was a very injured

99
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:08,680
lady on the sidewalk, she was pulling clumps out of her hair, she'd been clearly

100
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:15,480
punched a great deal of face was an absolute mess. And she told us that he was still inside the

101
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:21,480
male offender. And obviously, he would be violent towards us as police officers. Now that if you

102
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:28,520
read the paper, this may come across as if it was a like a kind of a one off incident. It wasn't,

103
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:33,800
you go to things like this all the time on a busy Friday or Saturday night, I could go to the two

104
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:42,520
or three of these maybe. So this was very, very normal, nothing out of the ordinary. And I said

105
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:46,920
to Jamie, okay, well, let's go on. We'll wait for some backup because he might be violent,

106
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:51,400
this guy and you know, we'll go in and we'll see what we can do. He's obviously going to need to

107
00:10:51,400 --> 00:11:00,360
be arrested because of the damage that he'd done to the lady. And she said, no, I've got my one year

108
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:06,440
old upstairs and he's in bed. And the minute that she said that, like, we can't wait for backup,

109
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:13,160
we have to go in because there's a chance that the child could be injured. So obviously that

110
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:17,000
changed our decision making. And as we're working up the front door up to the front door, the door

111
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:24,200
opens and this big muscley guy comes to the front door. And the thing that got me at that time,

112
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,520
and again, I just have to stress like I got these with the very, very normal incidents,

113
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:33,320
like we'd go to these all the time, there's something about this incident where I felt

114
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:40,840
like my heart hit my stomach, big adrenaline dump, all of the prickles on my arm stood up,

115
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:45,960
like my hair stood up, power reaction, and up the back of my neck. And I remember looking at

116
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:50,040
Jamie, Jamie didn't feel this and I spoke to him afterwards. It was really strange because

117
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:55,480
there was two of us presented with the same incoming sensory stimuli. I had a very different

118
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:00,440
bodily reaction. And we talked about it afterwards. I mean, at the time, I would like to say I was

119
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:05,240
eight or nine years of experience, Jamie was like coming up to two. So there was a big buildup of

120
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:13,480
abasing priors in me for some reason. Anyway, let's cut long story short. We ended up fighting with

121
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:21,400
the male. He was very violent towards us, really, really bad incident. And when we finally got him

122
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,920
in handcuffs, as we got to the front door, we noticed that he dropped a knife and he'd had

123
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:30,920
the knife when I pulled him out of the doorway. Now, this is like one of those moments that you

124
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:35,240
have in a policing career where your mortality punches you in the face, you know, because

125
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,160
had we gone inside or had we engaged him in a very different way, there's a chance that

126
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:46,200
both of us would not have come away from the incident. And sometimes that like hits you and

127
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:53,160
it hit us both then. And Jamie got very upset. I remember it very distinctly. We walked into the

128
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:57,880
kitchen, we had to go and check that the young lad was okay. And he was. And obviously, we got the

129
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:03,720
injured party back into the house. But I remember doing like an immediate reflection afterwards

130
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:11,480
and saying to Jamie, like, I have never had this severity of bodily reaction like that

131
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:18,760
that came on so quickly. And I've used the word salience to describe it in the paper.

132
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,800
But there was something that was distinctly different. And I don't know what it was. But

133
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:28,600
obviously, whatever signals I was receiving, be it from the lady on the curb or from the

134
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:33,720
male's behavior as we approached door, there was something in me that told me intraceptively. So

135
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:40,040
it was an internal feeling that then triggered my cognitive processes to approach the incident

136
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:47,560
differently. Anyway, that incident, obviously he went to court, he went to jail actually.

137
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:53,400
So the incident itself, we managed to safeguard the lady in the sun, which is always a good outcome.

138
00:13:54,760 --> 00:14:00,280
But for me, it really stuck with me for a couple of reasons. The first was that the bodily reaction

139
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:05,800
that was so different was something that Jamie didn't receive at all. So there was no difference in

140
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:13,960
him. He saw nothing of the evidence that I saw. And when I say saw, this is obviously, and again,

141
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:18,120
covering the paper, there's so much information that you're taking into these incidents. And it's

142
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:24,520
in such a temporal window that such a tight temporal window that your ability to be able to

143
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:31,400
affect the environment that you're in is very, very highly constrained. Because you're only going to

144
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:38,360
be at that incident, maybe for minutes, if you're lucky, an hour or over, depending on how busy

145
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:45,000
the radio is. So you can't do what you would call any longitudinal niche, niche construction,

146
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,600
your ability to mold or shape your environment when you turn up as a police officer is limited

147
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:55,000
solely to the time that you're there. And because you don't know any of the people there,

148
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,920
there's something going on in the police officer's brain. And again, this is discussed in the paper

149
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:11,640
that is very different to a normal work environment. So I'm just going to, I'll try my best to give

150
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:16,520
you an example. So if you work on a till and customer services, you have a very predictable

151
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:21,720
way of living your day out. And of course, the unpredictability comes from the customers.

152
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:26,520
But there's often a set of like procedures or protocols that you follow that enable you to

153
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:31,720
deal with those people in a particular way. And that allows you to predict your work and hopefully

154
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:36,760
comfortably do that. Now, when you're a police officer, you have the law. And this was interesting

155
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:41,320
actually, Daniel, because when we first had a chat about this, I think you put me in touch with

156
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:45,960
somebody who was talking about the law as an agent of active inference, which is proper

157
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:51,480
interesting stuff. And if we get time, like later on, it might be worth a discussion. But

158
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:57,400
the officers are working within the law. So you've got bounds, if you like, you have boundaries that

159
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:04,440
you work within. And there's particular actions you can take. But everything is so highly

160
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:09,000
unpredictable. I'm not working with a till and working directly with people. It's often in a

161
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,680
very, very emotionally charged environment, because that's why police get called in the

162
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:17,400
first place. You don't know any of the people that you're dealing with, and they're not coming to you

163
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:21,400
asking for the same service. So it's not like you're going up to a shop and saying, I want to buy

164
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:26,680
this again and again and again, which is the same thing that you'd get as a cashier. When we turn

165
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:34,360
up, a lot of the time, people don't even want police there. So you come in as like a kind of alien,

166
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,600
if you like, and there's often something that again, it's like high emotions, everything's

167
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:43,560
going a little bit crazy. The decision making of those people is normally totally out of the norm.

168
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:48,520
You're trying to bring everything back within the norm. So if you like that the officer is like

169
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:52,360
an agent of our status, we're trying to bring back home your status to the environment and get there.

170
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:59,320
But it's so messy, and so difficult, that you often end up making decisions that other people

171
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:03,480
may look at and say, Oh, why have they done that? It's such a strange decision. But if you've been,

172
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:08,920
and I suppose in the paper when I go through it, if you've been in that particular situation a

173
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:14,760
number of times before, and you have a good set of Bayesian building blocks that allow you to make

174
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:19,480
but improve decision making as a result of that experience, you may end up with improved outcomes.

175
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:28,600
And I'm not going to say that you will, but you may. And it's a solid theory to back up

176
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:33,480
good experience led decision making. And there's lots of things that you can look at. And hopefully

177
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:38,120
the paper towards the end might be able to just talk about some of those and I can take the viewers

178
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:45,160
through them. So that's the kind of background. The salience of this particular incident is the

179
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:50,440
one that the paper is based on. It was so different to me during my police career that I needed

180
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:58,440
something that explained it. This theory explains it in a lovely way. It's so nice. And obviously the

181
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:06,200
kind of absorption of Carl Friston's work over time and the reading of the books. I mean,

182
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:11,720
that's inference book by Thomas Pye. I know that you're doing a series on it, a reading group on it.

183
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:16,440
It's brilliant. I would say it's a little bit hard going. Don't pick it up as your first book.

184
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,520
Do some listening to the podcast first, try and get your head around how it all works,

185
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:24,040
and then pick up the book and go through it. It gets a little bit heavy towards the end.

186
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:27,960
The experience machines are really good introduction. That's another good one. Andy Clark

187
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:32,520
talks about Active Inference Book. It's not an active inference book. It gives you a much wider

188
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:38,440
view on the cognitive neuroscience and how the active inference stuff is brought in.

189
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:43,880
But I really enjoyed that. And then obviously, when I'd had this idea and I'd written most of

190
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:48,280
the paper, I think I was at maybe, you know, six and a half, seven thousand words. I took the

191
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:55,480
lead and I emailed Mr. Friston. And I just emailed Professor Friston with a massive

192
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:01,960
chunk of humble pie and said, Professor, lovely to meet you. I feel like I know you because I've

193
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:08,120
watched you a million times online. This is what I've written. What do you think? And then

194
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:17,720
to my surprise, he sent me back another 800 words or so with a very heavy endorsement.

195
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,520
I was a little bit in shock. It's one of those moments where I was looking at my computer and

196
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:27,640
I was like, is that an email from? Oh my goodness. And then I opened the manuscript and I was like,

197
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:35,000
wow, okay, this is amazing. And then obviously a little bit more dialogue and we chose to

198
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:40,440
submit, but needless to say, and I mentioned this earlier in the podcast because I don't have a

199
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:47,000
background in maths or neuroscience. I'm fairly sure that those holes were evident in that first

200
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:54,200
draft. And Mr. Friston did an absolutely amazing job of plugging them. So I guess that's the story

201
00:19:54,200 --> 00:20:02,440
behind the research, Daniel. Did that make sense? Yes, you good with that? Yeah, thank you.

202
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:09,240
Okay. Have you got any questions so far or do you want me to just wait through the paper quickly?

203
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:14,920
Yeah, let's look through the paper. Okay, cool. I'll just go to share screen then.

204
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:24,840
Okay.

205
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:39,640
Okay, is that? Yep, looks like. Okay, perfect. So I don't want to read the paper only because I think

206
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:44,840
everybody will dive boredom, but I will skip through the sections and explain to you my thinking.

207
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:55,320
So I go very gently into setting the scene, talk a little bit about how police officers are often

208
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:59,880
flung into what you would call vital high-stakes situations. And this is elaborated on a little

209
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:04,120
bit further, but it's that temporal nature of the decision making, which I think causes very

210
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:08,440
specific grooves in the police officer's brain. And I'm using the word groove because I think it's

211
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:12,680
a really good analogy that kind of like explains the brain. It's not that we can't step out of the

212
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:17,160
groove, but they help us make decisions. And I suppose that's in line with heuristics. It's

213
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:22,520
actually in line with like hemispheric theory, like all sorts of like, and I talk about this later,

214
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:28,200
like system one, system two thinking. This is all quite well-established, good psychological

215
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:34,520
research. It all kind of melds together. It gives you a good little background. So I talk about a

216
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:41,960
little bit of the history with regards to the hunch and what the hunch is. It's been described

217
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:47,720
using a number of different terms. So we've got suspicion in here. This was done on research that

218
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:53,480
was conducted when it comes to things like stop and search. And stop and search is such a

219
00:21:54,840 --> 00:22:02,040
contentious area of policing. So high impact when it comes to things like community tension,

220
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:09,640
community confidence, trust, safety, legitimacy, a lot of it is linked with the use or the abuse

221
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:16,600
of stop and search. So there's been quite a lot of study that's looked at the decision to stop

222
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:23,000
and the decision to search, how those decisions are created and often through ethnographies,

223
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:29,320
where academics have gone out with police officers and watched officers conduct their

224
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:36,280
stops and their searches and how they've then asked after that's been done like,

225
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:40,200
how did you make that decision? How have you come to that decision to stop and search that person?

226
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:45,480
What was going on inside your brain? And I've then introduced the domestic violence incident,

227
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:49,560
which I've already discussed, so I'm not going to go through that. But I've just talked about this

228
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:53,640
bit here where it says this scenario creates fundamental question. How does an officer's

229
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:59,320
body generate these hunches, these internal alarm bells, and what role do they play in

230
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:05,320
navigating the experience of being a police officer? Now they're not restricted to police

231
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:12,040
officers and I talk about this here, especially when it comes to things like medicine and public

232
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:23,560
service based professions, armed forces, firefighting, etc. There's an excellent article and if I could

233
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:28,760
remember it, I would share it. But it was about a group of firefighters that went in there in the

234
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:34,360
midst of like, you know, fighting this crazy big fire and all of a sudden the supervisor just says,

235
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:39,400
right, get out, get out, get out. And he grabs all his team and he pulls them out and literally

236
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:47,720
within seconds the floor collapses. Now, obviously there's going to be no super particular salient

237
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:53,400
detail that's made him do that. It's going to be a gathering of details which are going on

238
00:23:53,400 --> 00:24:00,280
often unconsciously in the midst of the fire. Even him, I imagine, can't process in a way that's

239
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:05,320
rational and deterministic. He can't say this led to this and then this led to this and then this

240
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:11,240
led to this. It just, this overwhelming feeling came to him as a firefighter and he said, no,

241
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:17,320
come out, come out quick. And as they came out, the floor collapsed. Now that's an example of the

242
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:21,560
hunch, but the hunch within a firefighting circumstance. It's the same thing. It's like a

243
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:27,720
kind of overpowering feeling of intuition. So I talk a little bit about this here and we talk

244
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:33,240
about it being a little bit wider than stopping a vehicle. There is a discussion here of

245
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:40,360
almost like the spectrum of what a hunch can be like. How does intuition present itself?

246
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:44,200
There is some research coming very shortly from somebody called Emily Quinn at Cambridge.

247
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:49,640
She's just done a PhD in something called the copper's nose, which again is the police hunch.

248
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:55,800
I didn't know about this until after I'd written it, but I know that she's done a data collection.

249
00:24:55,800 --> 00:25:00,600
I know that she's much more hot on the terminology and the neuroscience and the cognitive science

250
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:05,320
behind this. And I know that her research is about to land. So just for the listeners,

251
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:13,080
it's definitely coming. That's going to be a treat when it lands. But a hunch or a copper's

252
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:16,920
nose when you're trying to find vehicles that may be up to no good, for instance,

253
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:22,280
I'd been in cars with people who are very experienced police officers and say something

254
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:27,240
like, I want to stop that car. I don't like the look of it. Now I'm trying to learn and

255
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,520
my immediate question would be like, well, what do you mean you don't like the look of it? What is

256
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:37,720
it about that car that's promoting this feeling of unease? And even the most experienced police

257
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:43,720
officers, they can't answer that question. They'll say something like, oh, well, maybe it's the manner

258
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:49,000
of driving, you know, but if it was the manner of driving, and I might have picked up on it,

259
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,760
there's something else, there's something that's, that's triggering. And I imagine their heuristics

260
00:25:54,760 --> 00:26:00,040
and their heuristics that have built up over time. Again, it'll be Bayesian. There'll be tiny signs,

261
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:06,600
tiny inputs, sensory inputs about a particular vehicle and the way that it is behaving that

262
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:13,240
over time have led to the building up of this, this intuition. Now, that is a very, very small

263
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:17,240
slice of what is intuition, a very, very big slice of what is intuition might come in the

264
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:21,720
detective world. So if you're working on a murder case, it could be that you have a very

265
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:27,160
particular feeling about one of the suspects, and that feeling may build up over time. Now, again,

266
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:32,760
very, very difficult to explain. Why do you, why do you have a feeling that that suspect did or did

267
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:38,280
not do it? Why, why is it coming? And again, those detectives, and I know I've worked with them,

268
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:43,320
they can't explain it. There's something that's, that's building up for them and they can feel

269
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:48,440
the hunch. The hunch isn't something that's visceral. It doesn't come into the pile of erection,

270
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:53,240
kind of like, you know, like response to threat or response to stimulus that's severe. It's very,

271
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:57,800
very slow creeping. And it leads to like this. It's almost like intrusive thoughts, you know,

272
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:02,920
like they're very, very slow. They come in without their unbidden. There's no like kind of, I'm not,

273
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:08,040
very, very, I'm not happy with this. You know, this is not good. You know, it's uninvited.

274
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:13,000
So the hunch can manifest itself in lots of different ways from the kind of, I want to stop

275
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:18,600
that car. I don't like look of it to something that generates over weeks or months. And again,

276
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:23,800
it's very difficult to discern like, where does that sailings come from? We don't know. We don't

277
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:28,360
know. And that's one of the things that I think that should be looked at. And I discussed this at

278
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:34,920
the end when we talk about where the research could go. So again, I take them through the incident

279
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:39,080
which I've just discussed. And we talk a little bit about the background of intuition research.

280
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:44,360
And then we talk about rational decision making and intuition. There's a meta study there

281
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:50,280
from Wang, Wang et al. in 2017. He's talking about constructs and think they are separate.

282
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:54,600
They've run up on the dual cognitive system, system one, system two again, emotional thinking,

283
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:58,200
what you would call emotional thinking and rational thinking if you were being a Philistine like me.

284
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:07,480
So, yes. And then I very, very, tentatively, and I have specifically used that word,

285
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:11,320
I'll just highlight it there tentatively. With this prior discussion in mind,

286
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:17,960
the author posits a definition of a hunch for the following discussion, which is an often

287
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:23,320
unbidden, salient intuition experienced by a police officer that subsequently influences their

288
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:29,000
actions. Now, when I say influences their actions, I don't mean that it specifically

289
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,520
sends them in a particular direction. That direction can be anywhere. But it's the fact

290
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:39,000
that it causes some sort of change in direction or causes you to consider a change in direction

291
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,760
that then, so in other words, it's instrumental. It's not something that just pops up and it

292
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:52,440
can be dismissed. It does something. Now, there was some pushback a little bit on the definition.

293
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:59,160
So words were added as we went in and through from the reviewers who were amazing on the article.

294
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:05,800
They were so cool, gave lots of different editions or possible editions and talked about this.

295
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:10,280
And we ended up with this, this inclusion of the word salience to kind of

296
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:14,760
generate to describe a hunch, you know, like what, well, it's the salience of the hunch.

297
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:19,320
It's not like a normal hypothesis. Our brain is constantly generating hypotheses all the time.

298
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:23,400
But there's something about this particular hypothesis when it pops up.

299
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:29,080
Wham, it hits you. Okay. Well, what does that hit feel like? Where is it come from?

300
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:33,720
And why is it different to your normal train of thought? What is it that's made it pop out?

301
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:43,320
And that then leads to the maths. Now, some of the narrative, probably half ish,

302
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:49,080
that this is mine, some of its calls. And Professor Friston went into a lot more detail than me.

303
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:54,440
The equation that I put forward for surprise was tripled in length.

304
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:01,240
So he went into a lot more. This was the Bayesian brain bits. We introduced the Bayesian brain.

305
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:08,120
If you like the older research. And then we bring in the newer research data, for instance,

306
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:17,480
free energy principle. And then Professor Friston added the detail in the equations here.

307
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:22,200
And also the figures, which have come in, which are the background, if you like,

308
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,160
for these equations. How do these equations work? And what do they say?

309
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,320
But what's the gist? So if I was to describe this.

310
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,840
Surprising bounds or the level of surprise that somebody operates within.

311
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,800
A police officer is going to be very, very sensitive

312
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:47,880
to boundaries of surprise. This is the hypothesis, essentially because,

313
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:52,280
and I talk about this in the next section, which is about cultural niche construction,

314
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,440
because they have very little control over their environments and they have very little

315
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:02,120
knowledge of the people within them. I think that their brain will generate hunches

316
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:09,400
in a much more sensitive fashion within those constraints. So essentially,

317
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:15,880
and through the gathering of experience, very temporarily informed, if you like,

318
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:23,080
work environment. If I go to a domestic, and I walk into a domestic incident,

319
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:26,440
and the male and female are shouting and throwing things at each other, I have,

320
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:34,440
I have no discretion. I have to take action immediately because there's harm that can

321
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:41,400
take place at any point to either of the parties. So I have to take what is a very active role in

322
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:47,000
that environment immediately. And therefore, I'm constantly training my brain, I think, personally,

323
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,280
as a police officer, this is what I think goes on, to take action and to take action decisively

324
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:59,400
in order to reach desired outcomes. Now, in most people's daily business, they have lots of time

325
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:04,120
to make these decisions. And as a police officer, you just don't. And that generates

326
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:09,880
grooves. I think it generates grooves in the police officer's brain, and it leads to something

327
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:14,280
which has come out in the ethnographic literature around policing called pragmatism.

328
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:20,200
Now, it's described as a tendency to do over a tendency to think. So a police officer will often

329
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:27,080
tend, I think, towards jumping into some sort of very active role in the environment,

330
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:34,920
sometimes too quickly, way too quickly. But I think that too quickly, and I'm going to use

331
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:41,880
air quotes there, is Bayesian. I think that your brain is trained to intervene quickly

332
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:47,480
in many, many cases, and it sets up grooves. And those grooves are very easy to fall into.

333
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:55,720
And that presents risk. So I'll give you an example. If I'm going to be controversial here,

334
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:01,560
but this is where I think the research will be really cool. If, for instance, there is a drug

335
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:06,440
problem within a particular neighborhood, and that neighborhood is high in ethnic minority,

336
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:14,920
and it could be ethnic minority from anywhere. So in the UK, Albanian, for instance,

337
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:20,200
or it could be black in London, or it could be Afro-Caribbean. There's lots of different

338
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:26,360
ethnicities. But if there is a community which is heavy in a particular ethnicity,

339
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:30,360
and as a police officer, you are constantly interacting in what will be

340
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:37,800
highly temporal niche situations, normally violence-related, with that community,

341
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:45,320
that's going to influence the way that that officer thinks and reacts in other, maybe less

342
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:53,480
temporally influenced situations. So I'll give you a physical example. If I am going to

343
00:33:55,080 --> 00:34:00,680
gang-related violence a lot, and I'm dealing with victims that have been injured as a result of

344
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:07,640
gang-related violence, if I do a stop and search in that same area, and I have been to all these

345
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:12,760
previous incidents, there's going to be a building up of influence and experience in me, which is

346
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:19,320
then going to change the way that I behave when I stop that car. And you will see this in the

347
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:25,800
research, this comes out in a lot of the way that police officers are perceived when they're dealing

348
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:32,040
with ethnic minorities, the way that police officers act, they're not the same when it comes to

349
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:39,640
majority population interactions. But I do think, and again, I'm pushing this theory way out from

350
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:46,440
beyond my paper here, I do think that we can probably find some evidence of why that may be the

351
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:53,480
case, and maybe prove empirically that the more incidents that you go to that could be highly

352
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:58,680
temporally influenced, that may involve particular ethnic minorities, could then change the way that

353
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:03,640
you as a police officer operate on a much more wider scale with members of that ethnicity. Now,

354
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:08,680
I don't think a lot of that's conscious, and I know because I've worked with police officers,

355
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:14,920
I mean, I met one racist police officer in my entire service of 18 years. So I know people say

356
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:18,840
other police officers, police, police are racist, you know, I don't think it's as simple as that.

357
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:23,320
I think it's way more complicated. I think that we have to really understand why police officers

358
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:27,720
make the decisions they do over time for us to properly unpick this problem. I don't think it's

359
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:33,320
something that we can turn the page on. And it's going to be years of good research, some of which

360
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:39,160
is alluded to in Andy Clark's book. So anyway, I'm going a little bit wide here, but all of this

361
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:45,880
influences that conversation that I've just had. I'm not going to go into the detail,

362
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:52,120
but that's the bit that is there. And we have this wonderful addition from him,

363
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:55,400
which gives you the background to the theory from Professor Friston.

364
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:01,000
Now, this is the section that if I had the choice, I would have put a lot more

365
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:06,360
words into. And this is the hundreds of niche construction stuff, and you'll probably be able

366
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:13,000
to tell that from how I've been talking about it today. But low surprise, longitudinal relationships

367
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:19,560
probably make up the vast amount of our interpersonal relationships that we all experience on a

368
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:25,240
day-to-day basis, all of us in general in the world, unless you're in somewhere that's very,

369
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:30,920
very volatile. Mostly they're going to be low surprise, longitudinal relationships. So you

370
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:39,160
are going to have more opportunity to mould the environment over time. So that's the active bit

371
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:43,800
of the influence. So you've got this ability to interact with the environment, the environment

372
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:49,160
then interacts with you, and you end up with this constantly forward and back in between you and

373
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:54,600
the environment. The problem is, of course, again, with police officers, the ability to

374
00:36:54,600 --> 00:37:00,520
longitudinally change or influence an environment is just not there. You have, I have an hour at

375
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:05,160
most of the incident, and then I'm getting sent to another. And that may then cause, I think,

376
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:12,280
this pragmatic leaning to do rather than think. So that's the kind of what I'm getting to in

377
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:19,080
this last part here before moving into the discussion. So there's a couple of questions

378
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:22,280
that I've come up here. I've mentioned the pragmatism here from Loftus. This is from

379
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:28,280
the cultural literature. So what cognitive signals were generated by initial attendants that

380
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:32,840
contributed to the hunch generation? When the Bayesian brain processes these signals,

381
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:37,240
what is produced empirically during the process of active inference? What was the officer's

382
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:43,960
qualia? So how does the hunch present into consciousness? Massively complicated. And I've

383
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:48,360
even put it in the paper. We don't want to get into the consciousness debate because it's

384
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:55,800
absolutely fascinating, but it's just incredibly complicated. So there are some things here that

385
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:00,280
make that person aware. And this refers to that salience, which is in the definition.

386
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:08,920
How were those qualia interpreted? So when the hairs on my arm stood up, how did I see

387
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:13,400
the hairs on my arm standing up? So obviously, you're going to receive the signal, but how

388
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:19,320
do you interpret it and then turn that signal into action? These are questions that haven't

389
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:26,840
really been answered yet in this particular area. And then this last one, which I think,

390
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:31,480
it looks like an afterthought because it's one sentence, but it's not one sentence,

391
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:36,680
it's actually really important. How did the officer justify this hunch in later court proceedings?

392
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:42,440
And I have written hundreds, probably thousands of police statements over the years. And I know

393
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:48,440
that reading back those statements, they will read very rationally. They will read super rationally.

394
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:55,240
So my ability to rationalize my decision making, post decision making is way better than my ability

395
00:38:55,240 --> 00:39:02,600
to interpret a hunch rationally. And there's a big disconnect there. So you end up with a lot of

396
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:06,760
obviously hindsight bias. If you stopped a car and you found some heroin, well, you stopped the

397
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:10,520
car because you think that there was drugs on the car. But as mentioned earlier, in the

398
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:17,560
article, sometimes that hunch is nonspecific. It's raised through experience. That's

399
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:24,600
very, very different, really different. And I don't think that officers have got the skills

400
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:29,960
to interpret the hunches well enough to make well-reasoned decisions. I think that they rely

401
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:35,960
upon intuition much more than they say they do. And I'm not, well, I know because I've been one

402
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:40,120
and I've been around them. I know how these things work. So I just don't think that it's been

403
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:48,360
researched well. And then as we get towards the end, we move into the, again, the theory

404
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:54,920
support from that figure. And we posit a series of areas for future research.

405
00:39:56,360 --> 00:40:00,520
So we've got here longitudinal study on hunch development. So this is tracking the development

406
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:04,840
of hunches in police officers as their career develops. I think this is super interesting

407
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:09,480
because when I talked about going up to that door in the domestic and Jamie not feeling

408
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:15,640
anything and me having the most salient feeling I've ever had, there's something going on there.

409
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:23,800
So when does that start to happen? When do police intuitions become so noticeable and

410
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:28,680
powerful that people can see them and be able to act upon them or be able to notice them and

411
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:34,520
suppress them? Because even that is an interesting area. So if you are getting a hunch and you think

412
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:40,520
that hunch may be informed through past discriminations, then surely you need to be able to suppress

413
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:47,160
it. You shouldn't be acting upon it. So if you think, for instance, that there's an element

414
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:52,840
of discrimination in stopping a vehicle, you need to be able to notice that and stop that before it

415
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:58,040
happens. And it could be unbidden. And again, this is in the definition. So you haven't invited the

416
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:03,080
hunch. It just comes, but you may know that there's not enough there for you to make that stop.

417
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:08,200
There's not enough evidence. So something's going on and you need to be able to see that and stop

418
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:12,920
that happening. Comparative analysis with a little profession. So this is looking at the

419
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:17,560
generation of hunches, for instance, in the medical environment, neurobiological correlates.

420
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:22,680
So this was to look at neurobiological processes associated with hunch formation,

421
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:27,080
the use of brain and body imaging techniques. This is probably way above my pay grade,

422
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:31,800
but it will be super useful. And there is some precedent for it in very, very primitive studies

423
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:37,400
in the 70s and 80s that look at things like heart rate and blood pressure over the tour of

424
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:44,680
duty of a police officer. But it'd be brilliant to see that advance. Much more advanced wearables,

425
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:49,160
even looking at good scanning equipment, how are these hunches generated? It might even be one

426
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:54,840
for the future, but we thought we'd discuss it. The impact of training on hunch accuracy,

427
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:59,240
this is something that came from Professor Kempese. He was talking about training scars.

428
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:04,760
Have you heard of training scars, Daniel? No. So training scars are where

429
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:12,280
you constantly train in a particular way. Your grooves become very, very pronounced

430
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:17,080
in the way that you approach similar incidents because you train so much. And then when an

431
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:22,680
incident presents itself, your brain kicks you into those grooves, even though the grooves may

432
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:29,640
be inappropriate. So they can lead to, so for instance, taking a shot because that's a shot

433
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:36,440
you would have taken in training, despite the fact that that shot was non-justified. Or another one

434
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:42,280
where there's not enough threat in the training scenarios. So because of that, you act in a much

435
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:48,200
more slow and considered way when you need to act much more quickly. Both of those will be

436
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:55,800
considered training scars. And again, so overtraining may suppress good hunch

437
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:00,920
intuition or development. That's an idea. I'm not saying it's there, it's just an idea.

438
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:07,640
So diversity, and we'll discuss this quite a bit today. Insighting to potentially gendered

439
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:13,160
hunches. I mean, I'm super interested in that. Look, this plays out. When you look at the stats

440
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:18,920
of things like stopping vehicles, it is different. It's different from a gender basis. There's

441
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:25,720
something going on. No one's looking at it. I think this needs looking at. Operationalization

442
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:33,960
of hunches in policing. So when, and I'm currently planning a study that looks at this now, so using

443
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:37,560
both qualitative and quantitative methods, investigating the factors that contribute to

444
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:42,360
the activation and follow through of hunches. But to do that, you have to be aware that a

445
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:47,560
hunch is happening. And that's a that's the one of the things that we're trying to get our heads

446
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:53,320
around like, how do we, how do we make officers aware enough that intuition is kicking in? And

447
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:58,440
then when that intuition is kicking in, how do we help them describe it and also help describe

448
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:03,160
their decision making off the back of it? Because I think, again, if we go back to that pragmatism

449
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:07,160
side, I think the hunch kicks in the police officer makes the decision, but there's very

450
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:12,120
little rational consideration of the connection between the hunch and the action. So that's

451
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:17,080
something that I think we can look at. Comparative analysis of policing models, and I'll give you

452
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:23,160
a really quick and dirty example of this. So in the US, obviously, it's a coercive policing model.

453
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:28,680
In the UK, it's a consensual policing model. Both of those will change the way that hunches

454
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:35,960
are generated. They will. So have you heard of the touching the tail light on police vehicles? So

455
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:44,360
in the US, when a cop touches, stops a car, as the police officer walks towards the car to speak

456
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:50,200
to the driver, they touch the tail light. Now, there's lots of reasons for this. The first is that

457
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:55,080
you leave your fingerprint and DNA on the tail light. Okay. But if you think about what that's

458
00:44:55,080 --> 00:45:00,200
doing in the officer's brain, the immediate consideration when he gets out of that car is,

459
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:06,040
I could die. And I need to leave evidence on this vehicle in front of me. Now,

460
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:10,280
I have stopped thousands of vehicles in my police career, and I have never once thought that.

461
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:17,400
And because I've never once thought it, I can hypothesize that the generation of hunches will

462
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:24,680
be way different in terms of sensitivity to an American police officer's generation of hunches.

463
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:30,440
Not least because the threat is so mitigated in the UK, the chances of me coming up against

464
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:35,720
firearm is almost nil. I have never seen a gun. I've never fired one till about six months ago.

465
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:41,080
So like 18 years of service, and I've never carried and I've never seen a gun in a real life

466
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:45,720
police environment, that's going to change the way that I police. And I do think that there'll be a

467
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:50,840
different operationalization of hunches as a result. And that's something that will be a fascinating

468
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:58,760
study. And then this one here, this impact of technological support, how does the use of technology

469
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:04,600
change hunch development? So for instance, and this is going to sound really weird, but

470
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:10,120
let's just say a police officer is trained to record when a hunch is received. And it could

471
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:17,400
be as simple as a tap on the wrist for a wearable or something similar. And that could then help

472
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:22,360
us correlate the types of incidents that police officers are at when they receive hunches. They

473
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:26,680
don't have to explain them. It's just like, where are you most likely to get them? Where

474
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:31,960
does your intuition manifest? And then we could look backwards at how it manifested and what it

475
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:37,560
did. And then the last one, which is the public perception and trust. Possible to investigate

476
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:43,160
how public perception and trust in law enforcement are influenced by officers reliance on hunches.

477
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:48,200
So I'll give you a quick example of this. If you rely on hunches to do stop searches,

478
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:54,680
and that means that you do more stop searches, that may affect community trust within that

479
00:46:55,880 --> 00:47:00,200
that particular community where you conduct in the stop searches, that then becomes reciprocal.

480
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:05,960
So you rely on intuition to do stop searches rather than rational thought. That leads to a

481
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:11,320
rise in stop searches, leads to a rise in arrests, and also probably a rise in much more like

482
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:17,480
a friction based interactions with members of the public. Long term, that's going to lead to a

483
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:24,920
breakdown in relationships and possibly issues with legitimacy. So how the public perceive

484
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:33,000
the legitimacy of police actions. So that's just an example of where we could go on the big scale.

485
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:38,680
This last one's a very macro, like kind of level study. And some of these up here are much more

486
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:44,040
personally based. And Daniel, I think that's about it.

487
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:54,120
Thank you. Thanks for overviewing it. I have some questions and there's some great

488
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:57,320
questions in the live chat. So. Okay, that sounds good.

489
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:06,040
Wow. Many places to jump in. There's the fundamental tension with the

490
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:17,000
possibly arbitrary or hard to explain yet intuitive and honed nature of the hunch.

491
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:27,400
And about how the hunch has such a rich before, during, and after. There's kind of, there must

492
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:34,040
be something like hearing the code called on the radio. Yeah. And that setting a stage like,

493
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:40,600
I'm going to a comedy, I'm going to a horror movie, or it's this code and that's all that is

494
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:45,880
being passed through the blanket is just what code it is. And that's equivalent to like saying,

495
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:51,480
what is your prior? What do you prepare yourself for, given that it's just this number or that

496
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:56,760
number? And what are the costs and the sensitivities to like false positives and false negatives?

497
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:02,200
So there's a lot of stages to investigate, like looking forward to the hunch and then

498
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:07,640
looking back on it, where certain kinds of rhetoric or certain kinds of thinking are

499
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:13,960
privileged or supported by legal proceedings and saying something like, well,

500
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:18,840
I just didn't think it was that way in the moment, could be the most honest statement,

501
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:21,640
yet it might be seen as like almost malpractice.

502
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:31,080
Okay. Awesome questions from the live chat. Yes, exactly right. Okay. All right. Here we go. I'll

503
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:37,800
just read them basically in order they come in. All right. So Susan asks, does hunch lead to

504
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:45,080
epistemic foraging or pragmatic foraging? So let's just unpack that in the expected free energy,

505
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:53,800
decision making, functional, different policies are evaluated in terms of their epistemic value,

506
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:59,880
like expected information gain and pragmatic value, which is aligning observations

507
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:09,720
with your preferences. So how does that raising of the hunch then get pushed one way or another

508
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:18,520
into seeking more information epistemically or directly moving to take pragmatic action?

509
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:26,760
So I think that was a very nice way of summing up a lot of the discussion that where I talked

510
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:32,840
about the lean towards pragmatism, the desire for control for a police officer when they first get

511
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:43,320
there is like, it's almost primal. And I know that that's a big word to use. But they will, I think,

512
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:51,560
tend to lean incredibly strongly into the pragmatic and then move into the epistemic.

513
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:59,000
So, and if you think about this, this mirrors the court process, like if I turn up to an incident

514
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:04,600
and there's threat within the incident, the first thing that I want to do is, and I know the word

515
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:10,600
is awful because of the connotations it brings, but neutralise the threat. I want the threat gone,

516
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:17,640
because while the threat is there, my intuition is going nuts. I mean, it overrides everything.

517
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:23,320
I'll give you a very quick practical example. If I'm in an incident where I believe that the

518
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:27,880
male party in domestic violence is going to assault me or assault the victim while I'm there,

519
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:36,680
that my brain does not want to allow any epistemic foraging. No, there's a safety override and the

520
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:42,040
safety override is essentially make sure that this male is not going to assault you or assault the

521
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:47,800
other person before we start asking questions. And that safety override is often the thing that

522
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:52,040
people will look at and say, and this is what I meant when I talked about the difference between

523
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:58,520
jurisdictions. So, I would say that the safety override in the US is much more powerful than it

524
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:03,720
is in the UK because of the threat that's there, because of the availability of firearms. So,

525
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:10,120
you're probably going to find where there's more firearms, the link towards pragmatic foraging is

526
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:16,200
way higher, way, way higher. And then once that's done, neutralized, whatever word you want to use,

527
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:22,920
then that's when the longer form questions and the much more calm information gathering takes

528
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:30,920
place. So, really good question. There's definitely a lean towards pragmatic over epistemic,

529
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:37,960
but epistemic will happen and it just may come after the pragmatic. So, there could be a kind of

530
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:46,120
hierarchy, a hierarchy if you like affordances because of the situation that presents. Does

531
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:52,760
that make sense? Yeah, like to give a kind of a non-policing example, it's like you dropped an

532
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:59,400
object on the floor. If it was very surely just a soft carpet, you might feel around blindly and

533
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:05,480
epistemic foraging would have like a low risk. But if you strongly believed that there was like

534
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:11,640
other sharp objects on the floor, you would be way more skeptical with just kind of reaching

535
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:17,240
into dangerous locations. Daniel, can you answer my questions because that was way better than I

536
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:29,800
just did. Okay, next one. We'll each give a shot. Susan asks, how are police trained to avoid group

537
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:38,360
think i.e. not just follow the ones with improper force over motivations? So, you're talking about

538
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:45,160
individual cognition in that moment, but yet in that dyad encounter, there was like a collective

539
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:54,840
intelligence component and a difference in hunches. So, how does the group training and operating come

540
00:53:54,840 --> 00:54:03,480
into play? Yeah, this is really interesting because there's nothing about the way that your

541
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:11,240
brain behaves under pressure in any of the police training. Nothing. So, and I suppose, and this is

542
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:17,080
a massive criticism and I used to talk about this a lot because I was involved in the design of what's

543
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:22,440
called the PQF in the UK, which is the Education Qualification Framework. And it was a very,

544
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:28,600
very controversial project for me to be involved in, but it was about raising the initial level

545
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:34,840
of education to a degree level, bachelor's level for police officers. And one of the major drives

546
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:42,600
is obviously to blunt to some extent the lean towards pragmatism and offer some priors for

547
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:48,520
the making of police decisions that are better than those based just in practice. But this is a move

548
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:54,760
away from what you would call like a kind of master apprentice model, which is the, and it's

549
00:54:54,760 --> 00:55:00,840
experience based epistemic model now of police learning into something that's much more a priori,

550
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:08,520
which is your more traditional, educative professionalized model. So, are they taught to

551
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:12,520
ignore group thing? I'd probably say, well, there was no discussion of group things during my training,

552
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:16,680
but I have to think back, I mean, my training was 23, 24 years ago, and I'm sure that things have

553
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:26,520
progressed. Will it be good informed, solidly evident stuff? Probably not. And I think in some

554
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:30,920
cases, I think there may be some really good academics who will be out there working with

555
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:35,880
particular forces, and they will be given this sort of training. But I think it's a more general

556
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:40,760
approach. I don't think it's there. And I think it's a massive gap. So really good question.

557
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:54,120
All right. Yeah, very interesting. It's a team sport, team art slash science. And so,

558
00:55:55,080 --> 00:56:02,760
it has to be at least considered how do officers share their hunches? They just raise their hand

559
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:07,800
and say, I have a hunch. But that might be throwing a wrench into things in the moment.

560
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:17,480
So, how do the right communication surface, and then you have the radio, and you have the

561
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:23,160
local communication, you have these different avenues of message passing, but not all messages

562
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:30,680
lead to resolution of the situation. So, Daniel, that's a really good comment. And we're just

563
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:35,400
submitted a paper, which is on the use of decision making models in detective world.

564
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:41,560
And we were talking about this, like, I was only on a murder inquiry for a year of my service. So,

565
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:47,960
but I saw the way that the murder inquiries worked. And it is way more rational. And they

566
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:53,320
invite hunches. So, like, you're seeing your investigating officers will say, look, have any

567
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:58,680
of you got any feelings about this? Please try and explain them, you know, how or the other one

568
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:02,280
where you just run an interview with one of the suspects. And one of the first questions that

569
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:07,560
would come out isn't what did the suspect say? It's, what do you think? How did it make you feel?

570
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:14,440
You know, so there's a real space within the detective world for the discussion and sharing

571
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:22,360
of hunches. Now, if I pick that same instance up and you drop it into uniform, because it's so

572
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:28,120
temporarily enforced, that you won't get chance a lot of the time to share your hunches. Like,

573
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:33,240
so if I have a bad feeling about somebody at an incident, and this is that lean towards

574
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:38,840
pragmatism again, I will want to make sure that I'm safe before I go anywhere. I won't share

575
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:44,760
with the officer next to me, I have a bad feeling about that person. I want to take pragmatic action

576
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:49,480
to go and try and deal with that bad feeling. So again, this leans back into that other question

577
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:54,520
that we've just discussed. I would say that so the sharing of hunches and the passing of messages

578
00:57:54,600 --> 00:58:03,160
probably much more available within the long decision making processes within detective work

579
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:09,320
and very poor within the incredibly short, temporarily influenced decision making of

580
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:17,400
uniform. Does that make sense? Yeah, it also makes me think about active inference and

581
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:23,640
statistics are providing like a science of uncertainty and decision making amidst uncertainty.

582
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:31,880
And yet in many different domains, ranging from policing to law, science, there's kind of

583
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:39,400
bespoke ways of dealing with uncertainties. And different settings even within the given

584
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:44,680
field like different cases are going to have different treatments of uncertainties. And so

585
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:54,440
there's now this dance or a fusion to bring together those different treatments of uncertainty.

586
00:58:55,960 --> 00:59:02,280
I'm really curious how you see active inference and extended cognition in light of

587
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:08,760
even though I'm not very familiar with the details, the growth of policing technologies

588
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:16,680
and surveillance technologies and the different paths that a given officer or department might have

589
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:23,480
in front of them in terms of how they incorporate technology into their whole apparatus.

590
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:28,040
So there's definitely going to be a really, really big shift here.

591
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:35,640
So when I left two or three years ago, there were discussions three years ago about things like

592
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:45,480
the integration of active heads up displays. Okay, so when I'm at an incident, if I've got facial

593
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:51,320
recognition, and it's running in the background, and it's passing me information that I don't have

594
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:58,520
and didn't have, how will that affect my decision making? And that is, and I'm going to be really

595
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:07,320
honest, really scary, because really scary and really beneficial. So I'll give you a quick example.

596
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:11,160
I turned up at an incident again, I'm going to keep using the domestic incident because it's

597
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:16,040
simple and we as police officers go to them all the time. Okay, so it's a, and I keep calling

598
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:19,800
myself a police officer. I'm not a police officer anymore, I'm full-time academic, but you know,

599
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:27,320
one time. So anyway, if I turn up at an incident and I have a set of glasses and my body cam on,

600
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:31,640
my body cams running at all times. So I know that there's some element of surveillance of my

601
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:36,600
behavior. And I know that whenever you look back at this incident, my decision making is going to be

602
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:44,280
scrutinized. Okay, so when it goes into the court system, my behavior will definitely be on show.

603
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:48,440
And I know that as a result, obviously, I have to behave within the rules and the bounds and all

604
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:53,880
that sort of thing. Now, there's a propensity, and I'm sure you know this, of police officers to do

605
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:59,160
what's called informal working practices, where they essentially step outside the strict rules and

606
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:06,680
laws and they try and take pragmatic decisions. So an example might be if I stop somebody speeding,

607
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:10,920
I might want to give them a warning, I might not want to give them a ticket. But speeding is

608
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:15,320
technically a strict liability offense, so I should have to give them a ticket. And instead,

609
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:20,760
I operate and I use discretion, I decide not to do it, I give words of advice and that person drives

610
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:27,240
off. Okay. With things like your heads up display, if I'm walking towards that car, and I'm wearing

611
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:34,680
glasses that is giving me full history, full driving history, including infraction, speeding,

612
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:39,720
tickets, et cetera, just by looking at the number plate. And then when I get up to that

613
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:44,440
driver's side window and the window comes down and my facial recognition tells me that this

614
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:50,520
person has got previous for X, Y, and Z, a soul, et cetera. Is that going to change my decision

615
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:57,640
making 100% because what has the police officer got to deal with now? They have what's in front of

616
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:04,600
them. And then they do that epistemic foraging. The extended cognition that would come from

617
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:12,600
lifetime information during decision making is crazy. And I'll tell you right now, we'll be doing

618
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:19,480
it before we understand whether it is a good thing to do or not. Because that's what police do,

619
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:24,040
they will jump in probably. In fact, I'd be surprised if people weren't testing this stuff now.

620
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:32,120
And the other thing I think, I mean, I went straight to wearable stuff there, but there's

621
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:37,400
other stuff that might help. So if I'm thinking from an interceptive perspective, there's a really

622
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:45,240
good study called Emotional Survival for Law Enforcement Officers. It was a police psychologist

623
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:53,160
that wrote it. And he put heart rate monitors on police officers. And he showed that when you go

624
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:57,000
into what's called a Code 1 incident in the UK, which is an emergency incident, the blue lights

625
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,840
are on, you know, like you were talking about the code, the pattern of the information and the

626
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:06,520
bodily reactions to it. If I'm going to an emergency incident, when I first start, you're

627
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:11,800
incredibly aware, interceptively, of what's going on. So you can feel your heart, your

628
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:21,000
breath quickens, your periphery narrows, all of the normal stress reactions kick in.

629
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,760
Okay. Because you know that when you land there, there's probably going to be conflict of some

630
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:28,920
sort and you're going to have to deal with it. Now, what the study showed was that

631
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:35,240
very, very experienced police officers, so we're talking like 15 years, 20 years plus,

632
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:42,440
when they were going to the emergency incidents, they would say that those bodily reactions were

633
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:50,760
not happening. But the monitors would say that they were. And this is super interesting.

634
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:57,080
Because it may mean, you could say that the police officer has got more control over their

635
01:03:57,080 --> 01:04:03,400
interception, or you could say the exact opposite. So they have dulled their interception over time

636
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:10,280
through exposure, continued exposure. And we don't know about the effects on hunches,

637
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:16,040
or the effects on general decision making in those different lengths of service, if you like.

638
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:21,480
Now, if we go back to the extended stuff, imagine having a wearable that tells you this

639
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:28,360
lifetime. That would be super interesting. Like it, I mean, again, I'm like, you know,

640
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:32,440
maybe five years in the future here, but we're not a million miles away. There are well-being

641
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:36,040
wearables that are ongoing now. I don't think they're being used for this purpose.

642
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:41,880
Could they change decision making? Definitely. In good and bad ways, hey,

643
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:47,320
I know this just needs a lot more research, this bit that you're discussing, loads more research.

644
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:52,440
It just needs some proper, proper good looking at, because it could be immensely beneficial.

645
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:55,320
I can just see a million ways where it could also be quite damaging.

646
01:04:55,880 --> 01:05:06,040
Wow. Yeah, the awareness of the hunch. And then there's one setting where the hunch is not

647
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:13,000
aroused, which may be like a burnout situation. Yeah, exactly. And then yet also on the other

648
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:20,040
side of, let's just say, like a stage performer, they still might get the physiological arousal,

649
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:25,720
but they actually expect it. And so they don't attend to it because this whole thing with

650
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:32,200
active is not paying attention to what we expect. And so they have a deeper experience layer that

651
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:38,760
contextualized the hunch. And yet that might obscure that hunch from being communicated,

652
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:47,240
like to a younger colleague, and yet communicated where and how the experienced professor or

653
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:57,320
lawyer or officer feels in a situation is that ineffable experience transfer. And then I totally

654
01:05:57,320 --> 01:06:06,360
see these different paths with the wearables, one path where the boots on the ground are just

655
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:11,160
reduced to an actuator in a decision making system that they're not even a part of.

656
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:14,840
Because it tells them, here's what you want to do to this car.

657
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:23,320
Don't epistemically forage, just fulfill what the order is. Exactly. And then there's the

658
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:29,240
epistemic engagement mode. And we can imagine like the family doctor asking somebody questions

659
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:35,320
rather than like looking at their digital health record. And there's kind of, there's a charming

660
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:43,240
and an open-endedness to that. And yet in high reliability situations, people are going to be

661
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:50,040
put into which lane are we going to take this doctor's office? Are we going to use digital

662
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:56,840
health records? Or are we going to have slower, potentially noisier encounters just because

663
01:06:56,840 --> 01:07:04,520
people self-report that they like that more than the other way? Yes. Yeah. And just as you got me

664
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:10,040
thinking that there's some really good studies that look at things like cancer diagnosis. And so

665
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:14,440
you know, somebody comes in with a bad ankle and a doctor says, yeah, you need to go for this test

666
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:19,720
and this test and this test. And they're unable to rationalize that. It's the same thing, but there's

667
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:25,720
a much more. So if you look at a doctor's purpose, they're still going to be pragmatically based.

668
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:30,920
They're going to be trying to solve whatever problem is facing them. But their relevance

669
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:35,080
realization has got so skilled over the years. And this is some of the stuff that you were just

670
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:40,600
talking about there, where there's lots of signals coming in that are just very, very

671
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:45,880
efficiently dealt with subconsciously. And it may be about making that person aware of what

672
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:49,800
that subconscious is doing in order to properly understand it. And this is what I was talking

673
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:55,960
about with the hunch generation stuff. Because police officers don't often, they don't interrogate

674
01:07:56,600 --> 01:08:01,320
the journey that led them to make the decision, they make the decision and then they rationalize

675
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:08,440
it backwards. I think there's so much we could do here. There's so much potential because, and again,

676
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:12,680
this is for improved decision making. This isn't like, so we're looking at improved outcomes here.

677
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:16,360
We want to make policing better. How do we make it better? Well, I would say that increasing

678
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:21,800
self-awareness about decision making is absolutely fundamental. You can't go anywhere. This is just

679
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:30,360
like perfect, you know, and the whole framework of active inference and the Bayesian brain,

680
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:35,960
it just lends itself to this so well, way better than the other theories that I'd explored. And

681
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:41,400
some of which are in the article, like, you know, like the schema, the script, et cetera. But I

682
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:46,600
love Bramsted's work on niche construction in it. That's something I think that I would like to look

683
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:50,520
at a little bit more, I think, because as time goes on, sorry, my brain just went there towards

684
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:56,200
the end. I don't know why. Is there anything else on your question wise? Have we got some more?

685
01:08:56,200 --> 01:09:00,280
Yeah. Yeah. Okay, let's keep going with questions. Jeff asks,

686
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:15,720
I don't know the book, but what do you think of the general question?

687
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:25,000
I don't, but I have. So I work in a security and defense academy. So I'm surrounded by

688
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:29,560
military scholars. That's a really good question. And I will go and ask it for Jeff.

689
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:34,680
Cool. Okay. Dave asks,

690
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:49,320
Oh,

691
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:06,200
that's a really good question. And I have to be honest, I mean, I've read some stuff

692
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:11,400
on hallucinations, and I've listened to podcasts from machine learning street talk as well as some

693
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:17,560
good discussions around it. I mean, they're anomalies, aren't they? But

694
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:25,000
and I suppose you're going to have a set of rules within the LLM that still allows them to be

695
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:29,480
displayed in the same way that you're going to have a set of rules within the body that allows

696
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:37,960
the hunches to come to the fore. I don't know is the answer to that. And I know that we don't

697
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:43,640
properly understand hallucinations yet. But I would, I mean, obviously, we've got no consciousness

698
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:49,800
in in the deep learning machines point of contention, but most people would say there's no

699
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:57,400
consciousness there. Whereas the hunch, the hunch is ability to rise through the consciousness.

700
01:10:57,400 --> 01:11:03,000
So the quality of the hunch is the bit that makes it salient. And I think that that salience

701
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:10,200
will be lacking in any element of LLM deep learning based work, if that makes sense. Does

702
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:18,440
that make sense, Daniel? Yeah, I think another complimentary way that I thought of that question

703
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:26,200
is the hallucinations, let's just say in image output, you say represents this, and it makes a

704
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:32,440
full resolution image that is non factually based. And so people sometimes refer to it as a hallucination.

705
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:42,440
So whereas the outputs of that are in terms of observations that are just factually ungrounded,

706
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:52,200
the hunch, it's not like it's a, it's not a visual phenomena. It's not like there's a visual,

707
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:59,720
a new visual overlay or a sensory prediction. It's something slower that is kind of like

708
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:07,320
an upwelling of something that is salient, because as you pointed to, it's slower, it's

709
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:16,360
interceptive, it's affective. It's not modifying like what we see, smell here in the way where

710
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:22,440
when people talk about hallucinations as outputs of machine learning models, they're usually

711
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:25,880
talking about that. I think you might do that though, Daniel. That sounds really weird, but

712
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:33,560
I think it may to some extent do that. So and I'm just thinking about how that might be the case.

713
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:42,040
So if I'm at an incident, I'll give you another very quick example. So we went to conduct a

714
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:45,960
mandatory section in which is a horrible incident and I hate them, but it's essentially taking

715
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:52,440
somebody into full-time mental health care. He was a serious schizophrenic with, he was a danger

716
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:59,000
to others. And we went to basically take him into custody so that he could go to the hospital

717
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:03,960
because he wasn't, he wasn't refusing to take his medication or short for his appointments,

718
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:09,320
and it was carrying the community, et cetera, and he had to attack somebody. And I was in that room

719
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:17,240
for probably one minute and I was telling the doctors to get out because I knew what was coming.

720
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:25,160
And if somebody had, and this is what you say, well, it changes the way that you see,

721
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:31,640
well, it does because it changes your relevance realisation is that as the intuition kicks in

722
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:37,160
and becomes stronger, then your focus changes visually. So you're going to be filtering out

723
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:41,880
much more of the side if you like and focusing in on what would be considered the threat,

724
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:47,480
whatever the threat may be. And in this case, I mean, he was holding a knife down the side of

725
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:52,840
a sofa and he was about to attack us. And for some reason, something about that incident, again,

726
01:13:53,480 --> 01:13:59,720
highly salient feeling, it then changed the way that I saw, it changed the way that I interacted,

727
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:07,000
communicated, changed the way that I dealt with my externals, and I suppose you could call them

728
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:11,880
variables. So I wanted all the people out of the way, because that would then give me greater,

729
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:18,600
that would give me less to think about when the conflict actually happened. So I would probably

730
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:25,800
say, there's a little, there's a parallel there, I think that it can affect the senses. And I imagine

731
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:30,920
no, I quite like it. It's an interesting thing to think about.

732
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:39,080
I saw in the paper, you cited the quantum reference frames and Chris Fields' work,

733
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:43,400
so that just makes me think walking down a street, one reference frame is just like,

734
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:49,320
oh, there's people milling about. And then another reference frame, whether this is paranoid or not,

735
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:55,560
is like, their information to circle me, or somebody is shaking a little bit in their hand,

736
01:14:55,560 --> 01:15:00,600
and it's like, oh, maybe they have essential tremor. Maybe they're nervous. Maybe they're

737
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:07,400
about to do this. And so that doesn't change the, the photons hitting the retina.

738
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:13,000
That's right. It changes our framing. And that is what is actionable.

739
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:24,040
And a more cognitively informed law and legal system could have a more

740
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:33,080
agreed. Yes, you're right. Yes, you're exactly right. Yeah. Yes. Very good. I told you, you're

741
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:39,960
way better at this, Daniel. You wrap up my words and it just comes out in a much simpler way. Very

742
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:49,800
good. Let's, we're cruising together. Well, where are you going to go in your continuing directions

743
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:55,720
here? Like, what are you going to do with this now that you have the frontier's paper?

744
01:15:56,760 --> 01:16:01,320
Okay, so there's a couple of things that I want to do. I want to

745
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:14,360
test whether current decision making models in policing that are used widely in many different

746
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:23,960
countries are useful for the processing and understanding of police hunches,

747
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:29,400
because I think that they are accountability models and not decision making models. So that's

748
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:35,960
something that I want to look at. But I suppose the more relevant study will be research in the

749
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:44,440
quality of the hunch. So within different settings, especially within uniform, I'm very

750
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:50,120
interested in it because of its, its contact with legitimacy as a whole, like how police

751
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:58,760
are perceived. I want to know how uniformed officers receive, understand, process, and then act upon

752
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:06,680
hunches. And the study that I have in mind is, this is going to sound really weird.

753
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:13,560
I want to do like a kind of personalized dictophone, like a narrative account. So essentially,

754
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:19,480
when a police officer in any corner of the world makes a decision on the basis of a hunch,

755
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:26,760
that is then narrated into this kind of like repository. And we use that repository as a

756
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:34,760
qualitative evidence base to research how the hunch is processing and then acted upon.

757
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:42,760
That's what I'm thinking. So I'm currently in the process of getting funding. And I'm hoping that

758
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:47,640
I can secure it. And if I can, I'd like to run it as a, this is going to sound really strange,

759
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:54,200
but a voluntary, worldwide study. So I don't care where you're a police officer. I want you to take

760
01:17:54,200 --> 01:18:03,560
part. And we look at how you are receiving on a daily basis, your minor hunches from I want to

761
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:09,480
stop that car through to those like kind of heart hitting your stomach, pile or reaction,

762
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:13,960
high threat hunches that totally change the way that you see the incident in front of you.

763
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:21,560
So that's the, that's the next step, I think. That makes me think of Aeroid, which is a repository

764
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:29,880
of alternate states of consciousness, mostly based upon substances. So yeah, that's another,

765
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:38,360
but it's a voluntary self-report. And that sounds very cool and voluntary.

766
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:44,840
I'm hoping, I'm hoping that's the plan. But I'm hoping that once I get the funding,

767
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:49,560
that that will be a green light. And obviously in the meantime, I mean, it's been so cool talking

768
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:56,040
to you, Daniel. And I know that the community is quite tight in around the Active Infants Institute.

769
01:18:56,760 --> 01:19:01,320
So if anybody has been listening or if anybody listens to this in the meantime, if you've got

770
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:07,240
any cool ideas or you want to ask me any questions, but just email me. I love to talk about this stuff

771
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:10,920
in general. And the discussion, I know that we mentioned it right at the beginning, but even

772
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:15,160
the discussion where we talked about the law, I've got, I've got a theory that I've spoken to a

773
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:21,080
professor about. I'll just throw this out there just to finish off. I think that people may call the

774
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:31,320
police when the surprising bounds are breached. And they want the police to be an agent of return.

775
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:36,520
So essentially, the police become an agent of our stasis to return to home your stasis for

776
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:43,160
that person. Now, what that gives us, and it's something that we don't have, is a general theory

777
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:50,200
of police contact. And it allows us to see how different communities may call the police based

778
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:56,040
on their different surprising bounds. So for instance, in high chaos communities, their

779
01:19:56,040 --> 01:20:02,600
sensitivity to surprise is going to be much higher than those that are in, sorry, much lower than

780
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:10,920
those that are in very, very structured gated communities, for instance. And this, this could

781
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:16,360
lead us to some really interesting research. But it's something that is very much in the

782
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:21,160
background of my brain and something that I'm, I'm thinking about a lot, reading about a lot,

783
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:29,960
and hoping that maybe over time, I can start to develop it. Awesome. Thank you, Gareth, for

784
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:37,000
connecting these critical areas and bringing active in. And it's just exciting to hear where it's

785
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:41,480
going. Oh, thank you, Daniel. Thank you for your time. And thank you to everyone who's actually

786
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:46,120
managed to listen to me for, to drone along for this long piece. It's been a pleasure to have you.

787
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:51,240
Oh, there's great comments in the live chat. So thank you. Talk to you next time. Okay. Thank you

788
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:52,440
very much. Bye bye.
