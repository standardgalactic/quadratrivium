0	13200	Okay, and we're away. Welcome, everybody, to the third episode of Active Inference Insights,
13200	18840	brought to you by the Active Inference Institute. I'm your host, Darius Parveezy-Wayne, and
18840	24920	today I am absolutely thrilled to be able to speak to John Viveke. John is an award-winning
24920	28600	professor of psychology, cognitive science, and Buddhist philosophy at the University
28600	32680	of Toronto. He is also the presenter of the renowned YouTube series Awakening from the
32680	37880	Meaning Crisis, as well as the newer After Socrates. His work focuses on 4e cognitive
37880	42520	science, which holds that cognition is embodied, embedded, enacted, and extended beyond the
42520	48000	brain. In particular, John explores relevance realisation, our adaptive ability to zero
48000	53720	in on salient information in a world of near-infinite complexity. Last year, he, Mark Miller, and
53720	58000	Brett Anderson wrote the paper Predictive Processing and Relevance Realisation, exploring
58000	62960	convergent solutions to the frame problem, which proposes that trade-offs in precision
62960	67840	weighting, a key second order dynamic in predictive processing hierarchies, are at the heart of
67840	72320	our ability to be intelligently ignorant. And that alignment of predictive processing
72320	76600	and relevance realisation is exactly what we're going to be talking about today. John,
76600	81060	welcome to the show. Thank you so much for joining us. It's an absolute treat.
81060	88180	Thank you, there is a great pleasure. I'm hoping that Mark does make it on in December.
88180	93180	That'll be great. Yeah, absolutely. But in his absence, because Mark was meant to be
93180	99060	here today, but it's unfortunate, he's not unfortunately able to make it. Perhaps, so
99060	105020	this podcast is acting as a kind of primer and introduction for our audience to the critical
105020	110380	themes in cognitive science and psychology and biology, as well as maths and physics,
110380	118260	as they are right now. So I think it would be a worthwhile place to start if you could
118260	123380	just unpick what relevance realisation is, and then we'll come to how it aligns with
123380	133900	predictive processing. Sure. So relevance realisation is sort of inverts the way common
133900	140260	sense works. Common sense is there's a lot that is obvious to us. And you know what it's
140260	144740	obvious what you should pay attention to. We're sometimes mistaken. But it's obvious
144740	149580	what we should be remembering and what we should be doing. And that's all obvious. And
149580	155980	we just run from that. Our job as cognitive scientists is to explain how the brain generates
155980	163500	that obviousness, that salience landscapes that makes the right things stand out as relevant
163500	169980	to us so that we can do what is astonishing, solve a wide variety of problems and a wide
169980	176060	variety of domains. You're a general problem solver, which is just astonishing. I mean,
176060	180460	you can learn Albanian history, you could learn about swimming or rock climbing, you
180460	186780	can take up the study of dinosaurs in the Jurassic period. Like it's just, you know,
186780	192020	it's just amazing and astonishing. And there's good empirical evidence you have something
192060	196020	like a general intelligence. There seems to be a general capacity. There's individual
196020	201140	variation in talent. Some people are better at learning this domain than other domains.
201140	206180	But they're way back from Spearman. We know there's some sort of general ability. I'm
206180	210900	going to propose that the general ability are two interlocking things, the anticipation
210900	215300	and relevance realisation. What I mean by a general ability is these are kind of meta
215300	218840	problems. These are the two big problems you have to solve when you're doing any other
218920	225560	specific problem solving. And what makes relevance realisation so hard, generating that obviousness
225560	231240	so mysterious, actually. And that's what Scott Atrin says. He says that what science does
231240	236280	is it makes what's common sense to take, takes to be obvious, mysterious. Here's a table
236280	240760	in front of me, but physics says, well, what is that really? And they're mysterious and
240760	244920	it's made out of quarks and all this sort of stuff. It's the same sort of thing here.
244920	250680	Because when you think about it outside of common sense, you realise that there's just
250680	255240	an overwhelming amount of information that's constantly, as you said, dynamically changing
255240	259320	in the environment. There's an overwhelming amount of information in your long-term memory
259320	265160	that's constantly changing and being readjusted to the reconstructive nature of memory. There
265160	270840	is an overwhelming number of combinations of actions you can perform, sequences of action.
270840	277080	And yet, you ignore that overwhelming, almost all of that overwhelming information
277080	282760	and zero in on the relevant information so that you are oriented right in the world,
282760	289000	finding things obvious, salient, standing out. And it's not just a single thing. There's
289000	293000	like a salient's landscape. Some things stand out more than others. Some things are more
293000	298440	foreground, background. You have all this happening so that you are capable of solving
298440	305160	so many problems in a messy, complex world in which there's constant novelty because of an
305160	310600	emergent phenomena. And trying to give this ability to machines has been overwhelmingly
311400	316600	difficult and one of the hard, hard problems. We're actually bumping up right into it now
316600	321400	as we finally taken up the AGI project, the project of trying to create artificial general
321400	327720	intelligence. Excellent. It may be worth digging a little bit deeper into that
327800	334840	exposition because people might be thinking, well, don't we just have a module for relevance
334840	341400	or salience? Don't we just kind of, we're born and we know, oh, I should not fall off cliffs and I
341400	346520	should, but actually what happened yesterday might be quite irrelevant. You have a wonderful
348040	353560	explanation in your sort of keynote paper, Explicating Relevance Realization, where you say
354280	361560	that leads to an infinite regress. Perhaps you could explain that argument.
362440	366680	So the magic module, not to be confused with predictive processing's
367400	371800	reported problem of the magic modulators. So let's keep those two distinct from each other.
371800	377400	But the magic module is, well, I have a relevance realization thing in my head that just does it.
377400	384040	And then that just, and then I can just say, well, how does it do it? Then the mistake people can
384040	389320	make is, well, evolution made it. And that's right. Evolution tells me how it got here.
389320	393720	That's not telling me how it functions. Evolution tells me how my eye got here and
393720	398760	how my ear got here. And that's not telling me how my eye and my ear function. I'm trying to
398760	403640	take what's called the design stance. How could, tell me what I need to do to give that module
403640	408920	the ability to realize relevance? All you've done is said it has that ability,
408920	413960	but it faces the problem of, okay, now it has to know what to pay attention to,
414840	419320	and so on and so forth. Now, what you might say is, well, evolution totally prepared us for it.
419320	425000	The problem with that is that doesn't work. Evolution can only pick up on things that are
425000	433320	long-term invariant and that make an ongoing continuous difference to your reproductive
433320	440600	status. And that's not how relevance works. Relevance is really fast and changing. If I say
440600	445000	left big toe, it suddenly becomes relevant to you, and it wasn't relevant a minute ago,
445000	449640	and what's the Darwinian difference there? And there's nothing that's intrinsically relevant.
449640	454040	Well, my own life is intrinsically relevant, is it? You'll sacrifice your life for your kids.
454040	459480	Well, my life and my kids, under all circumstances, saving your kid
459480	463800	means that 10 million people, oh, well, and so on, and we get into all these philosophical
463800	471640	arguments because we realize, no, no, there isn't any hard, fast thing that is always relevant.
471640	477560	Relevance is not something for which we can generate a scientific theory. It's not stable.
477560	483960	It's not intrinsic to the phenomenon. And there's nothing, other than being relevant,
483960	490440	there's nothing that all the events or objects or feelings have in common. What is it that,
490440	494440	what do they all have that makes them, other than saying, well, you'll give me synonyms,
494440	499560	they're important to me, or they help me solve my problems? Yes, that's exactly it. But how?
500040	510520	Exactly. Perfect. And it's so nice to see how the apparently disparate strands of cognitive
510520	515560	science, so Gibsonian affordances for a cognitive science, predictive processing and
515560	521160	processing and active inference, align at this path, which is that everything is dynamical.
521160	526760	Everything is about this mutual unfolding. There is no rarefied static
527480	532840	existence. It's what's relevant to you might not be relevant to me, and there are these dynamic
532840	539640	relationships which govern that. Yeah, so that's a great place to start. I think
540360	546440	let's now go into the solution, if there is such a solution. And let's start with
546440	554600	opponent processing. So this is a term that you use frequently. To a layman audience,
554680	559080	it's not clear exactly what it means. So what is opponent processing, and how does it help
559080	565160	shed light on this complex problem? Sure. And maybe along the way, I can point out how
565880	571800	relevance realization really gives some specific teeth to claims of embodiment from 4-Ecox-I.
572360	576040	Because I'd like the point you made, and maybe we don't have to do it right now,
576040	579720	but I'd like to come back to it, how relevance realization is kind of a glue,
579720	586040	they glue together predictive processing and 4-Ecox-I in a powerful way and makes them all,
586040	591480	including itself, mutually stronger from that integration. But yeah, the opponent processing,
591480	597240	so let's just note something. At many different levels of analysis in your biology,
597240	602120	you will find opponent processing at work. I'll take one that's very easy to explain,
602120	609160	and people have a ready experience of it. So we are all constantly, mostly unconsciously,
609240	613560	although it's affected by conscious factors, we're constantly recalibrating and adjusting,
614520	619400	dare I say it, we're even evolving our level of metabolic arousal. I don't mean just sexual
619400	624600	arousal, don't be Freud here, I mean arousal. How much, how much, how sort of activated are you,
624600	630360	how sort of energized are you? And the problem is there isn't, there isn't some state,
631000	635800	homeostatic state you're looking for with that, because if there's a tiger in the room, I need to
636280	643960	maximal arousal. And if I'm going to sleep, I need to go to minimal arousal, and I can't just be
643960	648360	sort of Canadian and keep sort of average arousal at all times, because then I don't fall asleep
648360	654120	and I get killed by tigers. And so it constantly has to be, like we're talking about, it has to
654120	660120	constantly be adjusting. So what has evolved in your biology is your autonomic, meaning
660120	665480	self-governing, it's a self-organizing system. Like you said, it's a dynamical entity.
665480	672280	Your autonomic nervous system, and what it does is it couples together two subsystems that are,
672280	678920	have opposite biases from each other. So your sympathetic system is biased to, I'll speak
678920	683880	anthropomorphically, just because it speeds things up. Your sympathetic system is biased to seeing
683880	688120	as much of it can of the world as threat or opportunity and arousing you as much as it can.
689160	693240	And your parasympathetic system is biased the opposite way. It's biased to seeing
693240	698840	as much of the world as secure, safe, a place where you can rest and recover. And then these
698840	704840	subsystems are not independent from each other. They're locked together, and they're also, they're
704840	710600	continually trying to shut each other off. And they're constantly competing that way,
710600	715560	but they're cooperatively competing. It's not adversarial, they're cooperatively competing.
715560	721880	And what happens is the constant trade-off between those processes, between those processes,
721880	730440	constantly, right, in very dynamic manner, constantly recalibrate to your level of arousal
730440	734520	to the world. And that's opponent processing. And what you find is you got that, you know,
734520	738440	there's other, there's opponent processing between your focal vision and your peripheral vision.
738440	744120	There's opponent processing plausibly between your left and right hemispheres. The number of these
744120	750920	things, right, it is huge. And I say at many different levels of analysis. And so
752280	761000	I think opponent processing is a clue to how relevance realization is actually undertaken
761000	769400	by your embodied cognition. Wonderful. And immediately to anyone interested in active
769400	775160	inference or its manifestation in continuous state spaces as predictive processing,
776200	780840	what will be screaming out is this notion of an attractor set or our homeostatic equilibrium,
780840	787080	which Karl has spoken about at length, obviously, and has had many other researchers. But this idea
787080	796680	that what this, we are, we suffer, but we also embody in a kind of positive way this itinerancy.
796680	804360	We never, we're never stuck in a single mode. We are endowed with the capacity to
804360	809560	go beyond our homeostasis and return back to it. But we're always, in a sense, being drawn
809560	814920	without ever residing, without ever having stopped at that homeostatic set point.
816040	823000	So let's now fold in active inference to the picture. What does it provide relevance realization
823400	829320	and the formulation of relevance realization that couldn't be done purely with Fourier cognitive
829320	835880	science? So, I mean, I'm going to talk about it in terms of predictive processing, because that's
835880	842920	the one, that's the formulation of it, that lines up most cleanly with the theoretical
842920	847560	integration. As you said, there's there's clear derivation relations between active inference
847560	853000	and predictive processing, and also between them and the Bayesian math, but the Bayesian math, if
853000	856760	you were to actually strictly apply it would be computationally intractable. So we're doing some
856760	861080	approximation function. So I'm just going to take it that everybody sort of shall knows that I'm
861080	869080	playing fair with this, right? I'm not, I'm not trying to be dodgy. And so, relevance realization
869080	876600	is grounded in the idea of problem solving. And problem solving actually assumes a fundamental
876600	881720	thing, which again is so obvious to us, which is the states you're in and the states you want to
881720	886040	be in are not the same state. That's the defining feature of a problem. If I'm in a state I want
886040	891800	to be in, I want to be sitting in this chair. I am. I don't have a problem, right? And now,
891800	899480	what that means is you're all, you're immediately into something very interesting. The organism is
899480	908120	trying to actually predict a possible state in the world and prepare itself, so it's an agent.
908120	915960	It doesn't just behave. It alters its behavior to alter the states in the world, right? And so it is
915960	922200	trying to, I would say, predictively prepare for the world. It's trying to predict the world, but
922200	927480	prepare itself for that world, but also prepare the world so it's more likely to come out in the
927560	934120	prediction that it seeks, right? And so I put those two together, and I talk about anticipation.
935880	941560	And so whenever you're problem solving, you're anticipating a goal, meaning that prediction
941560	948120	and preparation. Now, Fourier coincide doesn't directly talk about that as clear as it needs to.
948120	954440	It talks about coupling, and it talks about affordances, and I think there's a deep connection
954440	959480	between opponent processing, optimal gripping, and affordances, and maybe we can exploit that
959480	967480	at some point. But typically, one of the things where Fourier coincide has some challenges
967480	974360	is in more distal relations to the environment, because it tends to rely primarily on coupling.
974360	978040	And this is a long-standing critique that one of my colleagues, Brian Cantwell Smith,
978040	981160	at the University of Toronto, because that is where all knowledge is flowing from,
982120	987160	right, has made. He said, you know, you can be predictably coupled to things that you're in
987160	993960	direct causal contact with, but, you know, sorry, dynamically coupled, not predictably coupled,
993960	1000280	my apologies. But how do you do things that are much more distal? And for me, that is key.
1000280	1008840	And here's why I do this. I think when we evaluate, even intuitively, so I'm not using that as an
1008840	1015400	authority, I'm just showing how readily this works for us. When we evaluate an organism for
1015400	1020520	its intelligence, we tend to do it in two interlocking ways. We do it in terms of, I think,
1021560	1025080	how well does it zero in on relevant information? How well does it pay attention to what it needs?
1025080	1029880	We look at an animal and go, wow, that's really good. Notice how it's noting subtle differences.
1029880	1034520	But we also evaluate the intelligence of an organism, and Michael Levin talks about this
1034520	1039480	with his cognitive light cone idea, is how deeply into the world they can anticipate. And I don't
1039480	1045560	mean just spatio-temporally, I also mean it modally, possibility. Like when I talk to my cat and I say,
1047240	1052280	you know, where's your toy? The cat looks at me and I go, no, well, I say to my puppy,
1052280	1057240	where's your ball? And she goes into the other room, looks for the ball, finds it under the
1057240	1063320	couch and brings it all the way back to me. I go, wow, you're really smart, right? And so we get
1063320	1070200	this because we know how just moment by moment that adaptive ability is built on how distally
1070200	1075320	can we pursue goals? We tend to evaluate people, wow, you pursued a long-term goal and you brought
1075320	1081400	it up. So that's what's missing. And I think that's what's really afforded. Now, I want to make one
1081400	1087080	more point, and then I'll shut up so you can ask me another question, which is these two issues,
1087880	1092040	anticipating more deeply, and remember, I don't just mean spatio-temporally, I mean modally,
1092680	1099480	and relevance realisation are deeply interconnected. The more you anticipate, the more the problem of
1099480	1106680	relevance realisation goes up exponentially. And so these two things, right, they, I would argue,
1106680	1111400	because they're interlocking, they have to be solved together. And I think that's why we use
1111400	1115640	both of them as evaluations of the intelligence of an organism.
1116600	1124040	Okay, I'd like to backtrack to that second argument after this, after what I say here.
1126360	1133640	Yeah, it strikes me that what predictive processing can give, perhaps where 4e Cognitive
1133640	1139000	Science doesn't, but I'm happy to be schooled on this. And I know Varela and Autoporesis in some
1139000	1145480	sense pre-shadowed and prefigured what I'm about to say, is that it kind of gives a ground to
1145560	1151560	our action and to our perception, which is that we have to have a model of the world and a model
1151560	1157240	of ourselves, which is not only descriptively viable, but also normatively viable. In so far as,
1157800	1163320	it's all like, it's very important for me to be able to predict the world. But as you said,
1163320	1167560	we aren't just at the behest of the world's dynamics, we can change the world according
1167560	1174840	to our preferences. Exactly. And I think what predictive processing gives us is, although to
1174840	1181880	be fair, I think Carl might say that this is a bit of an overshoot, is a telos, is a fundamental
1181880	1187080	attractor set to which our perception of action is governed. So I think that's kind of the way that
1187080	1195000	I see the added benefit of this convergence between predictive processing and relevance
1195000	1199800	realization. What I was also going to say there is that it's, fantastically, you're mentioning
1199800	1205000	this kind of deep temporal modeling. Because from my eyes, that's really where a lot of the work
1205000	1212040	is being done right now, which is that selfhood consciousness, even perhaps space itself is
1212040	1220040	downstream on the fact that we can downstream on the degree to which we can model the slower
1220040	1227400	dynamics and the faster dynamics in a generative hierarchy. So that's, I think that's it. I mean,
1227400	1230600	complete agreement with that. I think that's an extension of the argument I made.
1232280	1238040	And so what I wanted to pick up there is you said, if I heard correctly, that the more,
1238040	1243640	the deeper your temporal model, the more you can model slower fluctuations in the environment,
1243640	1248680	the more critical relevance realization becomes, the higher the stakes in some sense.
1250440	1254760	I'm interested in unpicking that argument, because from my eyes, there are plenty of
1254760	1263160	things out there that don't have deep temporal models. So a virus, for example, you're just
1263160	1269160	reacting to very coarse-grained features of the environment. But for them, relevance realization,
1269160	1271800	at least to my eyes, appears as critical as it would for a human.
1272680	1278440	It is. It is. And so I think it's how I'm going to put it, I think it's always the
1278440	1288360	demanding problem. So I'm not denying that even the paramecium has to do salience landscaping.
1288360	1293320	It has to, I'm going to use a word very neutrally here. I'm not connoting anything about consciousness,
1293320	1299240	but it has to recognize this molecule is food and that molecule is poison and swim reliably
1299240	1304360	towards the one and away from the other. So I think the problem is always there,
1304360	1309640	as I was trying to indicate, as soon as you have problems, as soon as your goal states are
1309640	1314200	distinct. And I think the space opens up very quickly exponentially. I just meant that it
1314200	1322520	exponentially gets worse. This is why you see across species, hyperbolic discounting,
1322520	1327320	temporal discounting, because that's a huge relevance realization machine. It's about
1327320	1332840	salience discounting. And the point of that is, is because as you opened into the future,
1332840	1337960	the number of possibilities goes up exponentially. And so you need to have this attenuation function,
1337960	1343240	so you don't get overwhelmed by the possibilities as you extend your cognition into the future.
1343240	1348600	That's why we have hyperbolic discounting. And we pay a huge price for it. It makes us procrastinate.
1348600	1353160	It makes us difficult to give up, to pursue our long-term goals. So there's even a trade-off
1353160	1357560	relationship in there, but I won't get into it. But that's an example. There's a good reason why we
1357560	1362200	must have something like temporal discounting across species. That's what Angelie showed,
1362200	1368120	is because the relevance realization issue just, it gets even worse. It starts out bad and gets even
1368120	1374920	worse. Right. Wonderful. And yeah, I mean, a lot of your work will come to affordances now because
1374920	1380040	a lot of your work is centered on the notion of affordances. So affordances are the possibilities
1380040	1384600	for action afforded, actually circular, possibilities for action granted by the environment. I mean,
1384600	1391480	afforded was a verb and then Gibson made it now. How much has the predictive processing
1391480	1396440	framework supplemented your understanding of affordances? And perhaps the way that
1397240	1404520	what we perceive in the world is not necessarily a feature list of objects, but they are fundamentally
1404520	1411560	affordances. I see my glass of water as grippable rather than being glass this dimension. And I
1411560	1419080	only ask that because, as I said, as conscious, animate cognizers, we are blessed with the
1419160	1425400	capacity to change the world in accordance with our priors, which makes action really the fundamental
1425400	1433000	currency for auto poesis, for self-organization. So does it has predicted processing ramped up
1433560	1440040	the importance that you give to Gibsonian affordances? I don't have it ramped up because I
1440040	1446840	always thought I literally learned this stuff from John Kennedy when it gives his greatest
1446840	1454680	protease. So very early on, I was very much impressed by this. And it occurred to me that
1455560	1462120	relevance realization, the realization of relevance, and I mean realization in both senses,
1462120	1466840	actualizing a possibility and becoming aware of it, or at least detecting it in some fashion,
1467800	1472840	that it's a prototypical kind of affordance. The thing about affordances is they're not found
1472840	1478600	in the object or in the organism. The grippability of the glass is not in the glass, can't be gripped
1478600	1486840	by a peramecium. And it's not in my hand. My hand can't grasp Africa or the sun. It's in a fitted
1486840	1492200	relation between them. And that's exactly what relevance is. It's a fitted relationship between.
1492200	1499560	So I always, before I came into a deep dialogue with predictive processing, I already saw a deep
1499560	1505320	relationship between relevance, realization, and affordances. And I think part of my work has been
1505320	1510760	to really explore the deep ontological significance of that, that we have a category that sort of
1510760	1515800	falls outside. This was Gibson's intent, too. This is what Forde Cogside is really talking about.
1515800	1522760	Falls outside are our belief that we have a complete exhaustive dichotomy between the subjective
1522760	1527160	and the objective, between the inner world and the outer world. And so there's this other important,
1527160	1531480	why call it the transjective, this betweenness, this connectedness, that you see in
1531480	1536920	adeptivity, you see in relevance, but you also see it, like you said. Now, what do I think
1536920	1544360	the predictive processing did? If you'll allow me, I want to talk back and forth symmetrical,
1544360	1551240	not just linear. So I think what the predictive processing does is emphasize the need to try
1551320	1559560	and explain, rather than just... I don't want to be cruel. So I'm being a little bit oversimplistic.
1559560	1565720	I'm doing that just for speed. But generally, it's like, yeah, but how do affordances get actualized
1565720	1571720	in the Ford E-caller? Like, there's a lot of affordances all the time. And what I'm interested
1571720	1577480	is, how do those affordances become, well, salient and obvious to me, so they become
1577480	1585320	binding on my sensory motor behavior. And that was always something of, not that there's Redfield
1585320	1590600	and others who are doing some work on it, but typically they start to invoke predictive processing
1590600	1597080	to try and explain that mechanism of, okay, there's a huge affordance network, but I'm not...
1598760	1606440	Here we go again. How do I select and actualize the ones that actually go into my salience
1606440	1611800	landscaping? And I think predictive processing, especially with the notion of precision waiting,
1611800	1616600	is a good job of that. And what I think relevance realization helps to do to predictive processing,
1616600	1621480	a bunch of other things. But one thing is, predictive processing, basically, there's subtlety
1621480	1624920	to this, and I know there's lots of mouth, but just to keep going, right, that, you know, well,
1624920	1629240	what attention is, is the precision waiting? It's this meta function. And I think that's a
1629240	1633560	very good argument, but there's a conceptual analysis that's been needed, but it's like,
1633640	1638520	but what is salience? And one of the arguments I can make is, well, what the precision waiting is
1638520	1644520	doing is relevance realization. And relevance realization, when relevance realization does
1644520	1650440	a higher order finding relevant of an affordance that has been generated by lower order relevance
1650440	1654600	realization, that's when something becomes salient to us. And so we can actually give a
1654600	1660680	conceptual explanation that goes with the theoretical identity claim in predictive processing,
1660680	1665400	the precision waiting is attention, and what it gives you is salience. So they can, they can
1665400	1673560	unpack each other. I think what another thing that happens is, relevance realization is deeply
1673560	1678120	connected to foreecogside, because relevance is grounded, I would argue, in auto-polisis.
1679400	1686840	Relevance, relevance is always relevant to an organism, right? And so that means,
1686840	1691000	relevance realization is a cold calculation. It's how the organism cares about some more
1691000	1696040	information rather than all the other information, because it is constantly taking care of itself.
1696040	1700440	There are literally, and I mean this physically, things that matter to it, and things that it
1700440	1706360	must import into itself, important things. And some of that's also information. And so
1707400	1713720	why that, if you, if you can, if you can glue foreecogside and predictive processing together,
1713720	1718680	I think you can answer some of the questions, maybe even challenges, that some people in
1718680	1723400	foreecogside are making of predictive processing and saying, well it's not really connected to
1723400	1729800	embodiment. I think, no, no, if you show a deep theoretical integration of predictive processing
1729800	1734120	and relevance realization, and then relevance realization and auto-polisis, then you've really
1734120	1738760	strongly glued predictive processing and foreecogside together. So that's some of the
1739720	1745560	important theoretical work that you've done. Yeah, absolutely. I would love to jump into
1746520	1753240	the critiques that certain foree cognitive research, cognition researchers have leveraged
1753240	1759240	at predictive processing, but let's leave that for a second. This is exactly what I was talking
1759240	1765800	about in terms of telos, which is that exactly this notion of care. And when I spoke to Mara
1765800	1772120	Albaras in an active inference researcher last week, we kind of actually ended up concluding
1772120	1776600	that this is almost the Heideggerian sense of care that we take from our existence.
1777320	1781800	Can I, can I just interrupt there? Yeah. Right. Heideggerian sense of care was exactly what I
1781800	1788280	was invoking. And I, right, and I was deeply influenced by Dreyfus and the frame problem,
1788280	1795160	got this from Heidegger. Yeah. So the connection you just drew is very, I, I, yeah, I explicitly
1795160	1800920	argue for that. Excellent. So yeah, I mean, I personally think that the Heidegger, Heideggerian,
1800920	1806360	Dreyfus, Merleau Ponty lineage needs to be integrated more into active inference. And I'm
1806360	1812120	speaking to Dr. Marilyn Stendera, who has done work on Heidegger and auto-poesis. So that will be
1812120	1815320	really, that will be really fun in the upcoming weeks. This is exactly what I was talking about
1815320	1819960	in terms of telos, which is that taking a stance on your own existence can be computationally
1819960	1826760	modeled as having these kind of high precision priors. So our homeostatic set point will be
1826760	1831560	different from a snake's. And that actually gives a really solid explication of why we act
1831560	1836760	differently in certain contexts than snakes. And so that was my kind. But then that said,
1836760	1842840	I will have to make clear that Carl is in himself, although he has spoken about existential imperative
1842840	1848200	says that there actually is no imperative. All that you're really saying is if a thing like us
1848200	1853320	is to persist over time, this is what it needs to do. And it's just a, it's just cast as a
1853320	1858920	minimization of free energy. So I think there's an interesting question there that maybe you
1858920	1864600	could have a go at, which is to what degree do you see this as a genuine imperative versus
1864600	1872200	just what things do to self-organize over time? Yeah. And so I mean, and Carl's no
1872200	1878040	slope, so he's welcome. I sometimes don't like it when people who, you know, are physicists or
1878040	1883560	something start commenting on philosophical normative questions with an authority they
1883560	1890920	don't properly possess. But I know Carl's a great theorist. And I know he's philosophically educated.
1891640	1894520	I have not yet to talk to him, but I hope I do get to do so.
1894600	1904120	We can do ahead. So yeah, I mean, so I'm going to argue later if I get a chance that what
1904120	1910440	relevance realization doing is strongly analogous, obviously a very different timescale to what
1910440	1917480	evolution does about constantly redesigning the adapted fittedness of the, of organisms to the
1917480	1922520	environment and allowing organisms to fit their environments to them. Because as you keep emphasizing
1922520	1927720	and I keep agreeing with, it's not passive. It's not right. The organism is shaping the
1927720	1931480	environment as the environment is shaping the organism, niche construction and all that sort
1931480	1936840	of thing. And I think that's all right. And then there again, that's a very clear connection to
1936840	1941960	40 cogside again. But this deeper question, I do want to do it. I want to pause and I want to
1941960	1950280	slow down because it is a really important question. Because it gets us beyond what we might call
1950280	1958440	scientific explanations of how and into properly, but not useless, philosophical reflection of sort
1958440	1964360	of why. And why does this matter to me? Because as you've mentioned, I'm deeply concerned with,
1965000	1972120	you know, issues of meaning in life. This, this, this largely metaphorical, nebulous notion that
1972120	1979160	humans seek meaningful lives, lives that are worth living, even given all of our failures and our
1979160	1985160	faults and our flaws and our foolishness and our frustration, right? And pretty clear empirical
1985160	1992440	evidence that it's not reducible to just subjective well-being or pleasure and pretty good conceptual
1992440	1996680	philosophical argument, because that's where it's relevant, that it's not reducible to just living
1996680	2001000	a moral existence. You could live a very moral existence in which you're sort of experiencing
2001000	2007160	the pleasure of food and other things. And, and, and you've got, you know, certain stability in
2007160	2012200	your environment that you could be very, very lonely. You could be very lonely. So, and what,
2012200	2015720	what that loneliness points to, I'm just making an intuitive gesture. That's not a tight argument.
2015720	2020920	I have tight arguments, but the gesture is people are seeking a kind of connectedness. And now you
2020920	2025400	see where I'm getting to relevance realization and what we're talking about this niche construction,
2025400	2031000	the fittedness, the belonging togetherness, this mutually shaping, like this is this,
2031000	2036920	I argue that that's exactly the connectedness human beings are seeking the meaning in life.
2037400	2041960	Now, you can then ask the question and people, and I'm going to play with two
2041960	2046440	terms of phrase here to play with that. I think we clearly seek meaning in life.
2047880	2052520	I think the evidence for that is growing and it converges with the psychological work on
2052520	2058760	meaning in life and on what Karen Allen calls belongingness. If you don't feel that you belong,
2058760	2063480	you're in trouble and you're in trouble across all these measures, cognitive, emotional, social,
2063480	2069640	financial, blah, you're in trouble, physiologically you're in trouble. That's why solitary confinement
2069640	2077160	is such a punishment, right? So, is there a meaning of life to the meaning in life?
2078680	2087640	The meaning of life is that is there some sort of cosmic destiny, cosmic order to which we are
2088280	2095000	which we are ultimately trying to find. And here's the thing, I don't think I have enough evidence
2095000	2102040	for that. I think that there's lots of evidence for meaning in life and if I'm right that it's
2102040	2108920	relevance realization and if that's something very much like evolution, right? Evolution is
2108920	2117000	constantly redesigning adeptivity, but there isn't a final thing that evolution is aiming towards.
2117000	2121800	There isn't a final form of life. There isn't some like what we're doing is
2122840	2128520	like the sculptor, we're constantly refining and then finally one day we will have the final
2128520	2135160	form of life. And I think this is fundamentally flawed and I think this matters philosophically.
2135160	2142760	I don't think previous forms of life were in some in any kind of moral sense superior to us.
2142760	2148040	So, I don't believe in any nostalgias. Some of the previous things that people found important
2148040	2152680	and relevant and sacred, those were the true ones and we just have to get back there. Nope.
2152680	2158520	And I don't believe the utopia. We are working towards the final ultimate thing that will all
2158520	2165240	agree for all time is the most relevant, most salient. I don't believe that's how this works.
2165880	2173800	So, I reject nostalgias. I reject utopias. The idea that there's a telos can either mean
2173800	2179080	there's a telos to meaning in life, which is it's like Carl says, it's necessary,
2179080	2184120	it's constitutive necessary for living things to have this. But does that mean there's any
2184120	2190920	metaphysical necessity to their being living things? That's a different question. Now, here's my
2190920	2196280	weak answer at that one. Sorry. Long question, but you asked like this is like almost up there
2196280	2205160	with like God. Yeah. Right. Right. I note that I'm in a very difficult situation. I can't see any
2205160	2211640	evidence for and I'm not attacking God here. And as you know, I'm very respectful and even
2211640	2217400	appreciative of religious frameworks and religious lives. But I can't see any evidence for that.
2217400	2224280	However, if you were to ask me, which is a better universe, one with life in it and one without
2224280	2229560	life in it, even if you couldn't exist in either one, I would say the one with life in it. There's
2229560	2236280	some primordial judgment going on there that has some kind of metaphysical import. Now, it's weak.
2237240	2243800	I admitted that ahead of time. And so I'm giving you a very, I'm sorry, very long but wishy-washy
2243800	2250040	answer. I don't really think I believe in anything like the meaning of life, but I do think there's
2250040	2257960	a metaphysical import to being connected to reality. We find reality being connected to reality
2257960	2262920	inherently valuable for its own sake. And we find worlds in which things can realize reality
2263480	2269400	better worlds than ones that don't have that in it. That's my answer. No, it's a wonderful answer.
2269400	2275080	And it, it's really helped me and hopefully our audience clarify exactly what I mean by
2275080	2279320	an existential imperative, which is that the free energy principle doesn't tell you
2280280	2286520	what you're here for. No, it tells you if you're here, what are you doing? Like I've given your
2286520	2295080	phenotype and given your culture and etc, etc. So that's a really useful sort of explanation
2295160	2300120	of exactly what I was going for there. And actually, it points to something I said to
2300120	2305080	Carl right at the end of our podcast, which at the time of recording this came out yesterday. So
2305080	2309320	people should definitely check it out because he's, for sure, for sure, he's on top form,
2309320	2316600	which is that I asked him, I mentioned Thomas Nagel. So Thomas Nagel has this very romantic
2316600	2322760	philosophical notion that life is deaf is bad because life is fundamentally good. And it points
2322760	2327800	to kind of your thought experiment. If we had two worlds, one with life and one without life,
2327800	2332040	I think we would all intuitively say the one with life is better. Whether that has any
2332040	2340520	metaphysical input, as you say, is up for grabs. I was going to ask sort of jumping on the back
2340520	2345720	of the initial thing you said, which was about connectedness and belongingness. So if we take
2345720	2349640	this from a theoretical or computational stance and active inference, what this looks like to me
2349640	2356120	is we embody a model of the world which we can so we can make fundamentally sound predictions
2356120	2360840	about how the world will unfold and how about we will and how we will act to make that world more
2361480	2368680	compatible with our preferences. Now, when that was formalized initially in the active inference
2368680	2373560	literature, immediately a response to this came in the form of what's called the dark room problem.
2374200	2378920	So this is sort of papers in 2011, 2012, and they've been rebutted in multiple ways. But the
2379000	2384760	basic idea is why don't humans just seek out dark rooms where maybe they have access to food and
2384760	2390840	water, but they don't really seek out, but in a state where they don't go and explore and they're
2390840	2394760	not curious. Because what you're saying there is actually a perfect coupling between your predictions
2394760	2400760	of the world and the way the world is unfolding to your eyes. So I was wondering whether you had
2401720	2411080	pondered the dark room problem and where you see exploration and epistemic affordances coming into
2411080	2417720	play here. Yeah, I think that the dark room problem, I'm not, I'm happy with all the other
2417720	2422920	rebuttals. And I don't know, I don't know, I don't know them all, so I may be stepping on somebody
2422920	2432440	else's toes. So if I am, whoever you are, I apologize. I think this is a lock-in individualist
2432440	2439560	model of cognition and how we work. And I think it is therefore the presupposition, well, is that no,
2440360	2445560	that's actually, I don't agree with that presupposition, that our cognition is fundamentally
2445560	2454280	individualistic in that way. I think we are, you know, we are socio-social cultural mammals.
2454920	2461160	And let me point to one thing, you know, yes, measures of G are very robustly predictive,
2461160	2465480	but you know, it's also really a very powerful way of predicting your behavior,
2465480	2472920	your attachment style. This is also very robust. Now, that means, think about what that actually
2472920	2476680	means. And this, you know, and this goes into the heart of religious traditions, like agopic love,
2477320	2482520	right? When you have a child, you have to invert your relevance arrow. It's not how
2483240	2488440	that being is relevant to you. You invert everything around. This is agopic love,
2488440	2493480	and it's how it's different from erotic love or philea love. You invert everything around,
2493480	2498600	right? And so that it's, how am I relevant to this being? How am I relevant to this being? And
2498600	2504680	how can I be relevant in a way that turns it into a person, turns it into an intelligent,
2504680	2511720	rational, self-reflective, relevance-realizer, predictive processor, meaning maker, right?
2511720	2517400	And so, well, first of all, where are my attachment relationships in the dark room? Well,
2517400	2520840	there's other people in the dark room. As soon as there's other people in the dark room, all the
2520840	2525800	problems that you thought you got away from by putting me in a dark room return. Other people
2525800	2530040	have different goals than me. They have different needs. They're going to move around differently,
2530040	2533560	right? That we're going to have to decide about when and where and how we gain access,
2533560	2538200	blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. All of that immediately unfolds. Secondly, and this is part
2538200	2545000	of 4E CogSight, I think the evidence for extended cognition, distributed cognition,
2545000	2551400	that we evolve to work in groups, and the collective intelligence of that is actually
2551400	2557480	our superpower, and other people are making this argument. I think that's clear. The standard thing,
2557480	2562760	take the Waste and Selection Task, put it an individual person, highly educated, highly
2562760	2569480	intelligent, second-year psychology and top-tier university. From the 1960s on, you put them
2569480	2575000	in the Waste and Selection Task, and only 10% get it right, right? You replace that same task
2575000	2580520	with four people who are allowed to talk to each other, and their success rate goes from 10% to
2580520	2587640	82% reliably. Why? Because we do opponent processing between each other. You have biases
2587640	2593400	different from mine, and if we work in opponent processing, not adversarial, but if I say,
2593400	2597080	you're probably a good source for correcting my bias, and I'm probably a good source for correcting
2597080	2605560	yours, we get the best dynamical self-correction possible. When you add in the fact of the reality,
2605560	2610120	and there's actually evidence, empirical and formal, for the power of collective intelligence,
2610120	2615800	the reality of attachment, well, then the dark room becomes filled with other people
2615800	2621240	who are trying to band together to solve problems that they can't solve individually, and then,
2622120	2628440	to me, everything that the dark room thought it had as an absurdity, like a reductioid absurdum,
2628440	2632760	disappears. That would be my response. Yeah, I think eventually the dark room just becomes the
2632760	2638840	world once you start asking the things you need, eventually it becomes a civilization.
2638840	2643800	Yeah, I love all this stuff on distributed cognition. I spent the first six months of this
2643800	2649880	year working at UCL on finding experimental ground for what's called social baseline theory.
2649880	2655240	Social baseline theory is this idea that humans, like to study a human being in a lab by itself is
2655240	2662520	to study a human being at deficit. Yes. Actually, it's physiological arousal to take one factor
2663080	2667320	is at its baseline when it's with other people, and it will fluctuate according to stuff like
2667320	2671960	attachment style or the relationship that one has with that person, which is really beautiful,
2671960	2677000	but inverts our kind of, well, maybe not common sense, but our institutionalized notion of what
2677000	2682520	it is to be a person, which is kind of alone. Yeah, wonderful. Well, I'm going to take this
2682520	2687880	argument a little bit further if you let me, because this is something that we spoke about a
2687880	2691640	couple of months ago, and I think Mark might have a different opinion, so it'd be cool to
2692360	2699080	unpickle this. I have this slightly fuzzy, wishy-washy idea that the notion that, okay,
2699080	2705480	so I always think about a climber climbing a rock face or a climbing wall. The climbing wall is a
2705480	2711240	kind of beautiful canonical example of an affordance based landscape. It's rich for the affordances.
2711240	2717720	It's got the toe holes, the finger holes. So in many ways, what the rock, in terms of active
2717720	2723960	inference, what it allows the rock climber to do is to self-evidence or find evidence for its own
2723960	2730760	model about itself as a successful rock climber. Now, that's relatively well established in the
2730760	2736040	literature. What isn't established is my kind of, again, slightly wishy-washy idea, which is that
2736040	2743480	the rock climber is offering affordances to the wall. And so this is why, right at the beginning
2743480	2748120	of our conversation, I spoke about mutual coupling. So what dynamical systems theory gives us,
2748120	2754840	what auto-polysis gives us, what active inference gives us, is this idea that to exist is not to
2754840	2760920	be this kind of reified self that takes a objective stance on the world. And actually, what it is,
2760920	2766200	is this really the fundamental unit of analysis should be this dynamic mutual coupling between
2766200	2772120	agent and arena to use your terminology. I've spoken to Mark about this, and he
2772760	2777400	said it's something like an overextension of the term affordances, to say that the human being is
2777400	2781320	offering affordances to the climbing wall. I know Mark isn't here to defend himself, so again, I'm
2781320	2786280	not going to put one... But I will definitely raise this with him again. But just to your own
2786280	2792120	ears, how does that argument sound to you? I like the argument, and yeah, I don't want to speak
2792120	2797720	to you, but Mark, I'll only speak to the propositions that you spoke on his behalf. And I'm very happy
2797800	2802840	to... I mean, Mark and I work close together. Mark is one of the best people I know.
2803800	2810280	Mark's a former student of mine. I'm very proud of Mark, so... But I actually agree with you. Now,
2810280	2816680	that goes to another connection I make in my work that would probably be a little bit stranger
2816680	2820760	to the ears of many of your listeners. They might say, oh, I get why he wants to connect
2821800	2826760	to process inter-relevance realization and the 40-card side. But now what you're doing,
2826760	2830680	and this is where I do a lot of what I call my deeper ontological work, and this is where the
2830680	2836600	Heideggerian stuff really comes to bear, is this is all the work I do on neoplatonism,
2836600	2844120	which may sound like something very arcane. But again, here's the proposal that once we
2844120	2850520	really profoundly accept affordances, and once we accept that they are reciprocally realizing,
2850520	2855160	I agree with you, that affordance not only discloses things about me, it discloses things
2855160	2860760	about the world. And that's a way in which things, like Heidegger's notion of truth is alifea,
2860760	2867240	as an event, as the disclosure, rather than a static property of our propositions.
2868120	2873320	I think that, bang on, now, as Filler argues, and I've been arguing for a while, and John Russen,
2873880	2878680	Filler's book is called Neoplatonism, Heidegger and the History of Being, Relation as Ontological
2878680	2885480	Ground, that relationality is actually the ultimate nature of reality. Heidegger is actually turning
2885480	2889880	back towards this, because what does that give you? If you have that, and I think this is a fair
2889880	2895480	way to put it, if you have that alethetic notion of affordance, then you are getting back to the
2895480	2901400	neoplatonic theory of knowing by conformity, knowing by participation, and the deeper argument
2901400	2908360	goes something like this, that if the fundamental grammar of your cognition, I don't mean the content,
2908680	2914680	your content can go wrong, but if the fundamental grammar, the bottom up, top down, all this stuff
2914680	2920280	we're talking about, if it's not picking up on something fundamental about how reality is structured,
2920920	2926600	right, then you face the kind of profound solipsism, a profound kind of skepticism.
2927960	2932920	And I think that is ultimately leads you into all kinds of performative contradictions that I
2933480	2937000	and I agree with Whitehead, there is devastating as propositional contradiction.
2937880	2941720	There's a longer argument there, and I could point to, please check out some of my talks
2942680	2948040	on YouTube about this longer argument, like Pickstock's Aspects of Truth, where she said,
2948040	2953080	all the things we use to decodemize this, we had the analytic synthetic distinction,
2953080	2958680	that is broken down under philosophical criticism. We had the theory fact distinction,
2958680	2963400	that is broken down. We had the, like, is, ought, that has broken down.
2963400	2968520	Like, think about the relevance, it is or not, well, blah, right, it's sort of both, right?
2968520	2973640	And so her point is all the things that were used to cleave, and then what we tried to do
2973640	2978120	is we tried to make the logical world, the thing that sort of stuck the two worlds together,
2978120	2985560	and that collapsed under Godel and other people. And so we're back to the idea that we either go
2985560	2991640	into the Lockean cabinet, in which we're locked inside of our heads, we're somehow getting postcards
2991640	2996040	sent to us, we think they might be from an outside world that we think might be out there,
2996040	3001320	and we're trying to build it from the postcards, and we're doomed, that's never going to get us there.
3001320	3008600	And so I think if you have an allothetic notion of affordance, you start to make the argument
3008600	3014760	that how reality is realizing, and how we are doing relevance realization, are fundamentally
3014760	3024760	participating in the same principles in a profound way. And I think, yeah, I have no doubt that Mark
3024760	3031000	might not want to do this. I think Mark would be, I would agree with Mark that this is not a direct
3031000	3036920	derivation from sort of classic Christonian presentations of active inference and predicted
3036920	3045000	processing, Bayesian brain, we should settle on a name. But I think if you make the connections
3045880	3052600	through deeper into Gibson, deeper into Foricog side, deeper into Heidegger, you get back to this
3052600	3057960	notion that with the prevalent notion of knowing, that when we know something, what we're doing is
3059160	3063800	our structural functional organization is identifying with the structural functional
3063800	3070840	organization of the thing. And we are both participating in that same form, that same
3070840	3077960	principle, that same grammar. And that has all kinds of metaphysical and ontological consequences,
3077960	3083160	even ethical consequences. It means talking about the truth of good and the beautiful becomes
3083160	3089160	something very relevant again. Yeah, yeah, no, this is exactly where I wanted to go and exactly
3089160	3093240	aligns with the way I'm thinking about the free energy principle at the moment,
3093240	3098840	which is I have a skepticism between the internal and the external distinction.
3099400	3104360	Yes, it's something I spoke about with so a classic problem when one starts reading active
3104360	3112120	inference, as I spoke about with Carl, is whether one would consider the the agent or the internal
3112120	3118200	dynamics is having having a model of the external world or instantiating a model of the external
3118200	3124600	world. Yes, excellent, excellent. And since it's come back to sort of cybernetic formulations
3124600	3129320	of what it is to be a good regulator. So Colin Ashby and all of that stuff from the 50s and 60s.
3129960	3135000	So I have an inherent skepticism because I would I kind of take the stance that actually all that
3135000	3139720	the internal dynamics are doing is instantiating a particularized form of the external dynamics.
3139720	3145000	And this is very easy once you take out the picture of a homunculized ego. Just if you look at it in
3145000	3153880	terms of just the particle physics, we're just a instantiation of some of the physics that defines
3153880	3159400	everything else. But we just we just actually seem to have a kind of complexified Markov blanket or
3159400	3164600	Markov blanket form of that. But there's nothing particularly distinct about that. And we'll come
3164600	3169880	to consciousness because maybe there is. And that I guess is the big elephant in the room here.
3170360	3176840	But it's funny that you mentioned Heidegger because Heidegger to my to my eyes, and in my
3176840	3182840	opinion, and then obviously Dreyfus and Merleau Ponty and the phenomenologists followed Heidegger,
3183480	3192200	really, he's the one who strikes at this established distinction between a subject and an object.
3193160	3197560	So the Cartesian distinction. And then this is where his kind of gripes with Sartre came in.
3198360	3207000	Now, my question is, is that, yes, if you read Heidegger, Dasein, the ground of Dasein is this
3207000	3213160	kind of interrelationality. Alpha is the disclosure of truth in an interrelational relationship,
3213160	3221160	so to speak. But there still seems to be some kind of subject who, you know, the the hammerer who
3221160	3225720	is hammering away at the nail. Now, from the perspective of the hammerer, he's not some
3225720	3233160	reified ego who is objectifying the nail that all that is really being witnessed there from the
3233160	3240520	level of consciousness is the disclosure of activity. But still, we can give a description of a hammerer
3240520	3248440	and a nail. So to what degree in your thinking, do you completely eradicate the subject object
3248440	3253640	distinction? And is there anything that you think predictive processing has to say about that?
3254600	3257800	I think, well, the second question.
3263800	3267800	I'm happy to think about it with you. I have put a lot of thought into the first question.
3269080	3274920	And so, I mean, I think Filler is right in his book that our subjective objective divide is our
3274920	3280920	version of the appearance reality distinction. And it's just our version. In the ancient world,
3281000	3285000	they had a different version. So ours is an in out metaphor. How is the inner and the outer
3285000	3289640	connected? And the ancient world is the problem of the one in the midi. How is the lower and the
3289640	3296520	upper connected? And once you see that, you realize that there's a deeper structural problem that
3296520	3303960	isn't bound to the inner outer or the emergence and the emanation. It's the connectivity issue.
3304680	3313160	And what Filler argues, and there's a lot of other people converging on this, is if you try to,
3313160	3318600	if you go with an Aristotelian metaphysics, or that what's most real are substances in the
3318600	3325240	Aristotelian sense, which are things that can independently exist, then this becomes a big
3325240	3330760	problem for you. And that kind of ontology, I would argue, and I can make the argument,
3330760	3337320	drives you towards a nominalistic epistemology. And then you get, you know, Occam's version of it,
3337320	3342920	or Kant's version of it, where all of the patterns and all the information are just in the mind,
3342920	3348920	which means the mind is radically other, because it is the only place that the information
3348920	3356040	intelligibility actually exists. And the world is profoundly absurd in a deep, deep way. And I
3356040	3362520	think that leads you into, well, first of all, it makes science impossible. And it leads you into
3362520	3369480	all kinds of existential and moral dilemmas. And if you then take a look at the logic of trying to
3369480	3374360	get, you can't actually, and this is what Filler does very carefully, you can't actually get relations
3375000	3380920	out of properties that belong to the Relata. The relation has to precede the Relata in a very
3380920	3388360	important way. So I think there's a deep, at a very deep level, I do want to call it into question.
3388360	3398120	I do want to challenge that. First of all, it's historical. It's cultural. We pretend as if
3398120	3402920	that is the only way in which human beings have related to the world. Like I said, even in the
3402920	3407320	West, that's not their problem in the ancient world. Their problem is the problem of the one in
3407320	3412120	the many. It's not the problem of being in the world. Now, what does this all ground in? I think
3412120	3417080	this grounds in the common problem of the relationship between appearance and reality. And
3417080	3421320	here's where I could now say something that aligns with my previous argument about relationality.
3422360	3427720	See, so, and I'm going to borrow a term from rapport here, the hermeneutics of suspicion. The
3427720	3432520	hermeneutics of suspicion is that a parent, and we got it because of Freud and Nietzsche and
3432520	3436360	blah, blah, blah. There's historical reasons. And those are valuable critiques, by the way.
3436360	3441080	But the hermeneutics of suspicion says that appearances are distorting. They're deceptive.
3441080	3446840	They're destructive, right? They're disruptive. And what we should do is always question whether
3446840	3454120	or not they are leading us into reality. Now, Marlo Ponte has a great argument against that,
3454120	3462600	that he gets from, maybe he doesn't get, but it's in Plato, which is, wait, you're treating real like
3462680	3467720	red. Like, you could just say, if you could look at an isolated thing and say that's real.
3467720	3473560	But real is a comparative term. So, of course, is illusion. To say this is an illusion is to say
3473560	3480680	this is an illusion in comparison, in relation to something that is more real. And that thing
3480680	3486520	is in relation, so on and so forth, right? And what that means is, first of all, you have to see
3486520	3492680	that those judgments are inherently relational. And secondly, you have to call into question
3495320	3500760	the independence of the hermeneutics of suspicion. The hermeneutics of suspicion is actually
3500760	3507720	parasitic on the hermeneutics of beauty. It depends on there being things that we agree on
3507720	3513960	by saying that's where appearance discloses reality rather than distorting it, right?
3513960	3520200	And then as soon as you do that, that undercuts the deep divide, because you ultimately make these
3520200	3525240	divisions between the one and the many, or the subject and the object, by getting a hermeneutics
3525240	3529880	of suspicion into the appearance reality distinction. That's at least the argument I would make.
3530920	3539560	Interesting. Yeah, I like the suspicion of binary-ness inherent in all of this. It speaks
3539560	3542600	to me, and I think it speaks to people who are interested in active inference, and the notion
3542600	3549080	of sort of philosophical vagueness as well. At what point is something real? It's fundamentally
3549080	3556680	a comparative term in the web of things that could be considered real. Yeah. That's right.
3556680	3565400	Yeah. I'm trying to do this without invoking a binary, but you mentioned earlier that four
3565400	3571640	E cognitive scientists do have their critiques of active inference and predictive processing.
3572040	3577320	I will stick with active inference actually for now, and I will explain why later. It's not that
3577320	3587080	interesting. So this is people like Tony Camaro or Ed Bags who are radical inactivists, and what
3587080	3595000	they're critiquing, in a sense, is an interdelist picture of active inference. Again, I'm not putting
3595080	3602600	words into people's mouths, but if you read Jacob Howey's 2016 paper about self-evidencing,
3603880	3609880	some of the language may to some people imply that there is a homunculus that has a representational
3609880	3619960	picture of the world. This, to the ears of an inactivist, is deeply worrying. I would love to,
3619960	3625240	as a four E cognitive scientist with obviously a vested interest in predictive processing as well,
3625240	3631560	I'd love to just hear your take on that debate and, again, without striking up binaries,
3632120	3635240	and whether you think those critiques are legitimate.
3637400	3640680	Well, I mean, it depends what you mean by legitimate. I mean, there's also the ones
3640680	3645800	that Evan Thompson made, and I hold Evan in a very high regard. I mean, they're legitimate in that
3645800	3652680	they are well-made arguments in peer-reviewed journals, and so we have no right to be dismissive
3652680	3661720	of them. Well, if I was to say that let's take as an axiom of active inference. This isn't your case,
3661720	3667480	but let's just say, for sake of argument, that you have some interdelist representations of a
3667480	3673160	statistical model. So you are, in a sense, you're not just embodying a model. You actually have a
3673160	3678360	model. So again, it comes back to that distinction we're talking about. Would an inactivist critique
3678360	3682520	of that internalism be justified?
3687240	3694280	So the reason I'm hesitating is this is landing on the swamp of what do we mean by representation,
3695400	3702760	which, I mean, so does the thermostat represent the temperature in the environment?
3704120	3708760	And everything I'm going to say is controversial because of the swamp. So I want that understood,
3708760	3718520	please. I would say no, because what's needed is there might be some, there might be co-variation,
3718520	3725560	but what I think the critiques of the co-variation model of representation locks ultimately model.
3726680	3731240	So we had the idea that representations have to be similar to what they represent. That's how they
3731240	3735960	represent. And then you have all the problems with similarity and Aristotle even could bring that down.
3736920	3741720	And then lock replaced it with the co-variation model. To have a representation is I have something
3741720	3745960	in my head that reliably co-varies with something in the world, and that's how it represents it.
3745960	3752280	And then the problem with the co-variations is they don't give you the specificity, for example,
3752280	3759800	of thought. So this is co-varying with a bottle, with a tool, with a man-made object. Which is it?
3759800	3765720	Those are not the same things. Those are not the same ideas, but this is co-varying causally with
3765720	3772680	all of that. And you have the problem then of aspectualization. And the Lockian answer, of
3772680	3781560	course, is we get aspects by doing representation. But I agree with Searle that that's the wrong
3781560	3789400	way around, that any representation is inherently aspectual. When I represent this as a bottle,
3789400	3795080	I'm only picking up on some of its properties insofar as they are relevant to each other,
3795080	3801720	insofar as they are relevant to me. So representation depends on aspectualization,
3801720	3806120	which depends on relevance realization. And this is not what you do with relevance
3806120	3812120	realization. You do not represent all the facts, judge them to be irrelevant, and then zero in.
3812120	3818920	So it's ultimately non-representational. So what I would say is, I don't know that some level,
3818920	3826600	there's something like representations. But if I agree with many arguments that representations
3826600	3833880	are more than co-variation, but there's this kind of caretness and aspectualization through them,
3833880	3839240	then they depend on relevance realization, which grounds an autopolicist and is deeply
3839240	3845080	intertwined with predictive processing. That would be my response.
3845160	3852360	Splendid. And I guess what intuitively supports a more representationist picture is consciousness.
3853880	3857240	I think consciousness is going to become a recurring theme in this podcast.
3858920	3866280	Well, it's the Holy Grail, right? It is the Holy Grail. And so I guess my question here is,
3866280	3873960	is that if one was to adopt a radically inactivist view, there's nothing in that picture which
3873960	3879160	needs consciousness. So why couldn't my mutual coupling with the world just happen with the
3879160	3885000	lights off? So this is an argument, I guess, that's rooted in Chalmers 1995 paper, which is,
3885000	3891400	you can give me the function, but you can't give me the why, why are the lights on? And so I guess,
3892360	3898200	in other words, my question too is, yes, that we may have relevance realization,
3899000	3909880	preceding perception or grounding perception. Then why do we have perception in the first place?
3911880	3918920	So again, I'm going to give a gist of an argument that I've spoken about at length elsewhere,
3918920	3923080	and I'm trying to get published on and presented at conferences and so forth. So
3923800	3929320	I don't think you can separate the function and the nature questions, which is what
3929320	3935400	Chalmers Hard Problem relies on. Yeah, you've given me the function, but you've told me nothing
3935400	3939480	about the nature. I don't think function works ontologically like that. I think function has
3939480	3943640	to be plugged into the ontology. And I think as soon as we're talking about the ontology of
3943640	3948520	anything within a living organism, we're talking about something functional. So I think the questions
3948520	3954680	have to be answered interconnected. So let's go back. Let's say that you give me
3957000	3963800	that any cognitive agent has to be doing anticipatory relevance realization, or it's
3963800	3968440	not going to be a general problem solver. And then when it's doing that, it has to be
3968520	3979400	aspectualizing its world. It's not doing all of this, but this as a bottle or the molecule
3979400	3985560	as food, the molecule. And then if you then start to pay attention to,
3987240	3994040	let's look at the continuum of consciousness. Let's look at the possibility, which I have
3994040	3997880	experienced. That's not even the right sentence. Many people have, and this is Foreman's idea,
3997880	4003720	of something like the pure consciousness event. And the pure consciousness event doesn't have,
4005400	4009400	well, actually, I need a distinction here. I'm going to claim it doesn't have one type of
4009400	4014520	qualia, but it has another type of qualia in it. It doesn't have adjectival qualia. There's no red,
4014520	4019320	there's no blue, there's no cap, there's no dot. You're not even conscious of consciousness,
4019320	4027320	you're just conscious. But what it still has, is it still has the adverbial qualia.
4027400	4035320	It still has a sense of here-ness, noun, and the here-ness is profound presence. That's the language
4035320	4043640	with you. The now-ness, eternity, the integration, right, the together-ness, it's everything is one.
4043640	4049800	So all the adverbial qualia are still there, and you still have consciousness. That shows
4049800	4055880	that the adjectival qualia are not necessary to consciousness. Now, I have the other arguments
4055880	4061080	to show they're probably not sufficient, because if I give you sort of atomic blips of blue-ness
4061080	4065320	and green-ness, and they're not bound together, and there's not a here-ness and a noun-ness,
4065320	4073080	so you can anyway orient on them, I don't think you have consciousness either. So I'm not saying that
4073080	4078840	adjectival qualia don't exist. I'm saying that we've held consciousness hostage to them. And
4079560	4086440	what I'm proposing to you is that what consciousness is doing is these adverbial qualia,
4086440	4095000	which are just salience, which is just relevance realization, which is, as far as we can tell,
4095000	4100040	tied to the best evidence we have, it's all controversial, about the function of consciousness.
4100040	4104200	It's tied up with working memory and attention, which are both doing higher order relevance
4104200	4109880	realization. We seem to need consciousness for situations of complexity, novelty, or ill-defined
4109880	4114280	in this, ones that are really demanding on relevance realization. So you can make a pretty,
4114280	4119080	and there's a lot of convergence, actually, on what the function of consciousness is,
4119080	4123800	relevance realization. And I think if you plug in relevance realization, you can at least get
4123800	4130040	all the adverbial qualia. And that, I think, gives you a lot of what consciousness actually is.
4130280	4137000	Cool. Yeah, let's stay on that adverbial qualia, because I'd like to integrate what you've just
4137000	4142760	said with a more active inference account of consciousness, which there are, and then they're
4142760	4151160	also diverse. But one, well, I have to ask a question before, does Foreman say that mind-ness,
4151160	4157560	so feeling that this experience is mine, does he, is that one of his adverbial qualia that
4157640	4164440	persists in the pure consciousness event? So that has another thicket, because the debate about,
4164440	4169000	this is a raging debate. Evan Thompson actually has a good anthology on this, on the self-no-self
4169000	4181960	debate. Right. And I think it's reasonable and complies with most of the evidence, which
4181960	4187480	of course is self-report after the fact, which is problematic, blah, blah, blah, blah. I agree
4187480	4191800	with all of that. I'm not dismissing that. But that's what we basically have to go on right now,
4192520	4203240	that the ego narrative sense of mine and me and I goes away. Whether or not that is a complete loss
4203240	4218360	of the self as where relevance realization is happening or something like that. I'm not convinced
4218360	4224200	that that second thing is the case. I think, so if you would allow me, and this is a torture
4224200	4228840	distinction, a distinction between the ego and the self, I think these experiences very much,
4228920	4234040	the ego goes away. I'm very suspicious of the claim that the self goes away, because people are
4234040	4239880	readily able to recall these experiences. This is what Forman does report, and I would report to you
4239880	4245560	and seamlessly integrate them into their auto-noenic autobiographical memory. There isn't any weird
4245560	4250520	disjarring or where was I during that? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, excellent. The reason I asked
4250520	4257400	that is because a lot of self-modeling in active inference is based on the work of Thomas Metzinga.
4257480	4261960	So, Thomas Metzinga is such a wonderful addition to this conversation. I had a wonderful conversation
4261960	4268840	with him not that long ago. Oh, really? I love it. But on my show. Amazing. I think he's such an
4268840	4275000	underrated and important philosopher. Oh, I totally agree. Yeah, yeah. So, he's got this notion of,
4275000	4279800	so he makes a distinction between phenomenal self-modeling and an ontological self. So,
4279800	4284360	people intuitively, even everyone listening to this podcast, even the way we act on a day-to-day
4284360	4290440	basis is in lieu of an ontological self. So, we can't help but really think of ourselves as being
4290440	4294600	this soul, this Cartesian soul. But anyway, Metzinga invokes this notion of phenomenal
4294600	4301080	self-modeling, how the system appears to itself. And he's got this minimal phenomenal self, which
4302040	4306440	has been unpicked in other ways, but he normally speaks generally of presentness,
4306440	4311240	minus, and perspectivalness. Exactly what I've been talking about. Yep, exactly. And he gets
4311240	4316680	fleshed out in some of the active inference work. People like Jakob Howie, Carl, and Jakob
4316680	4322840	Limonowski have used Metzinga's work for several papers. And then, on the other end of that, we
4322840	4334040	have what Carl turned an epistemic agent model, which is the system that sees itself as epistemic
4334040	4339240	in the sense that it can retrieve past memories to inform future decisions, and agentive in the
4339240	4348280	fact that it can conduct allostatic action, i.e., action to retain some homeostatic equilibrium,
4348280	4351800	given what it knows about the future. So, me putting on a jumper before I go outside,
4351800	4355640	because I know it's going to be colder outside than it is inside. The reason why I invoke the
4355640	4360120	minimal phenomenal selfhood is because, and Carl actually outlines this in the podcast we did
4360120	4368920	together, that consciousness may be downstream, in a sense, on one, a deep temporal model,
4369880	4375880	and from that, the sense of agency. And he has an argument from referring to dimensions,
4376440	4382680	not in terms of sort of millimeter size, but in terms of the degree to which you have embedded
4382680	4389720	markup blankets, that when we're distant from our actuators, what we end up doing is we have to have
4389800	4393880	a way of distinguishing what's my action from what's your action or from what the world is,
4393880	4398600	how the world has acted on us. And in doing that, we come up with a self other distinction, but
4398600	4403880	also the notion of an agentive self, the idea that I can change the world in accordance to my
4403880	4410760	preferences, as I mentioned beforehand. So, to paraphrase Carl, what that seems to be
4411640	4417400	suggesting is that consciousness is actually rooted in selfhood. And I know there's this whole
4417400	4422600	argument in Metzinger about whether that's the case. That's why I asked whether mindness
4422600	4427320	is also part of these pure consciousness events, or whether it's kind of a post hoc inference.
4428200	4433560	Just wondering whether you had any ideas about that notion, and whether we can truly have
4434120	4439880	consciousness without at least the sense of self. Right. Okay. So,
4440600	4453880	let me try a few things. First of all, I don't think it's inevitable that human beings model
4453880	4462040	themselves as souls. I think that's a Western post Cartesian way of, and that's even, and then the
4462040	4472280	soul as a monadic single substance, I can put it that way. That's not even the case in the ancient
4472280	4479400	world of the West, certainly not the case in other parts of the world, etc. So, I hesitate that
4479400	4490840	that's the claim that's part of how the machinery must unfold. And then secondly, I worry about
4490840	4500600	saying that because it isn't a soul, there isn't a self. This is a weird notion, again, of a substance
4500600	4507720	ontology being just presupposed in an unquestioned manner. I mean, look, we've discovered most things
4507720	4513080	aren't substances. This table, which would be a classic Aristotelian substance, is not a substance.
4513080	4519800	It's a dynamical system of atoms and quarks, and we don't go, oh, well, because tables aren't
4519800	4527880	substances, they aren't real. Like that, we don't do that. And so, I want to just
4527880	4533320	note that I'm worried that there's a substance ontology creeping in here and leading to certain
4533320	4539480	conclusions. Now, that idea about this, I can't remember the name of the people,
4540360	4547240	and I apologize for that. There is a fairly recent theory of consciousness that trying to
4547320	4552840	respond to all the lipid experiments and things like that, arguing that, well,
4552840	4559880	consciousness is sort of after the fact, but consciousness is actually for the future. So,
4559880	4567320	the idea here is, consciousness emerges out of the evolution of episodic memory. And so,
4567320	4572200	the function of consciousness is to allow us to create an episodic memory of something we have
4572200	4578280	already done. And the point about the episodic memory is, as soon as you get into episodic
4578280	4582920	memory, you get into perspectival knowing. That's what an episode is. You have a perspective
4583800	4589880	on a situation, what you found salient and relevant, how your actions and the arena
4589880	4595320	coupled or didn't couple, the affect, all of that, all of that that's so bound up
4595320	4600920	with consciousness. And the point they make, and I totally agree with this, is as soon as you agree
4600920	4605000	that there are multiple kinds of knowing, not just propositional and procedural, but also
4605000	4612600	perspectival and participatory, you get the argument that episodic memory affords
4613400	4617640	perspectival knowing, which allows you to solve problems that you can't solve without
4617640	4623960	perspectival knowing. You can pick up on the world, the world discloses itself in ways that it is not
4623960	4632920	otherwise disposable to you. And then consciousness emerges as an optimization on the formation of
4633480	4639960	episodic memory. So it is optimally transfer appropriate for the future. And then you get,
4641160	4649720	it is a sense of agency, but it's not a billiard ball agency. It's this kind of longitudinal agency.
4649720	4655000	And to tell you the truth, given the human critiques, that's actually the kind of agency
4655000	4665240	the cell has. It has this kind of longitudinal agency around episodes. It doesn't have this,
4665240	4671320	I'm an sort of uncaused cause, a moved mover within myself, which I think is
4671960	4678520	both a ridiculous proposal ontologically and an ethically undesired. Why would I want such a thing?
4679000	4686680	It's completely arbitrary. I think my life is being lived. I'm trying to change myself so that
4686680	4692040	I am, my thoughts are as determined by what is true, my action as determined by what is good,
4692040	4697960	and my perception is determined by what is beautiful as I possibly can. I would like to lose
4697960	4704840	all my freedom in that sense. And so I think if we move to the right level of analysis, and Gallagher
4704840	4709000	makes a convergent argument about this, that when we're talking about agency and selfhood,
4709000	4714120	we're not talking at that limit scale. We're not talking at where's the first movement of the
4714120	4720520	billiard ball chain. We're talking more about, no, no, no, how are we building this long-term
4720520	4728200	virtual engine that enhances our predictive agency in the world? Yeah, absolutely. And Gallagher's
4728200	4735640	work is very convergent with Thomas Metzinger's, of course. And so this, just for our audience,
4735640	4742360	this, these arguments, and this notion of the narrativized self is well fleshed out in active
4742360	4747320	inference literature. So I could point you, yeah, I would probably start with the Fristlin and
4747320	4752440	Limonalski papers. There are two wonderful papers about self-construction under active inference.
4753080	4757640	And then I have a convergent argument coming out of Daniel Huda, who is also in the 4U,
4758280	4764280	the Narrative Practice Hypothesis. And he argues that any mindsight ability, any ability to see
4764280	4769880	in other people's mental states, you know, attributing beliefs and desires to them,
4771480	4776280	requires, well, for example, if I'm going to attribute a belief and desire, I need to know
4776280	4781800	something about your character. Are you lying or not? I need to know something about the context,
4781800	4786280	the setting. What's going on in this situation? Are you tired? Is that a small child? So you're
4786280	4789560	not really lying. And when you tell them at Christmas time that there's a Santa Claus,
4789560	4794920	right? Right. And I need to know what the conflict is, what the problem. Notice what I'm
4794920	4799560	talking about here. I need to know all the elements of narrative. Daniel Huda points out,
4799560	4804920	we practice narrative incessantly. And unlike many of the other things, including language,
4804920	4810680	which we scaffold for children, we scaffold narrative for our kids. I had to sit through the
4810680	4816280	teletubbies twice, in which you have to sit through these really impoverished narratives,
4816280	4823800	because we're scaffolding this up because narrative ability gives us the right, gives us the set of
4823800	4828920	skills, the sets of states of mind with the perspectives taking therein, and the traits
4828920	4834280	of character that allow us to pick up on other people's mental states. And I think that is also
4834280	4840200	a function of the self, the function of selves is to make us agentically predictive to each other.
4840680	4844840	Right. Exactly. Exactly. And there's another, there's another convergent argument in active
4844840	4851480	inference, which is that only in the context of other people like you, would you ever come to
4851480	4857240	the inference that there is something that is like to be you? Yeah. If you were low,
4858360	4862760	that converges with the Vagatsky approach to the development of metacognition and self-awareness,
4862760	4868760	which I think is right. Right. And of course, your colleague at just pointing people in
4868760	4872040	different directions, your colleague at Toronto, former colleague Jordan Peterson,
4873320	4880280	as a whole literature on literature and narrative. And he has a conversation with Carl
4880280	4886600	on his podcast, which is deeply intriguing about these kind of alignments of the free energy
4886600	4896520	principle and narrative. John, I wanted to also speak about flow states. You've written about flow
4896600	4902520	as the sort of locus of implicit learning. As you know, I've just been writing up a paper on flow
4903240	4908760	for an active inference perspective. So I'd love to be able to sort of see maybe where we align,
4908760	4914200	where we don't align and try and sort of unpick that. Just as forewarning my paper, the paper that
4914200	4920440	I've written with my wonderful co-authors is not out yet, but it should be coming out soon. So
4921400	4925400	I want to, I have not yet read your paper because you suggest waiting.
4926280	4931560	Yes. The paper has gone through modifications as papers are want to do.
4932920	4937880	It's in the final stages. So you have access to it. So please feel free to read it.
4937880	4944680	I will read it then. I will read it. I can give a very brief overview. So to not disadvantage you.
4944920	4951160	My, the basic thesis of the basic perspective that we take on the paper is about self-modeling
4951160	4955400	under flow states. So that's the main thing that we're looking at and the attenuation of an epistemic
4955400	4962840	agent model. Because what we're arguing is that certain precision waiting mechanisms are lending,
4965560	4970600	leading the organism to undertake pragmatic actions, seeking out pragmatic affordances,
4971560	4975560	rather than engaging in what Carl or other authors would call epistemic foraging.
4976680	4980360	Now, I think where we might have a point of difference here is that I have a section on flow
4980360	4985480	states and learning. And I think this is a really interesting point because your paper speaks about
4985480	4992600	implicit learning. Whereas I'm, and this, and just to make it transparent, this is there,
4992600	4998760	I've had different perspectives on this, but my current opinion is that in flow states,
4998760	5005080	what you're getting is a reinforcement of the skills that you actually picked up through epistemic
5005080	5014760	work. So I have the example of a violinist. The violinist must undergo a certain period of exploration,
5014760	5020280	of epistemic foraging, which comes with this kind of self-talk, this real prominence of
5020280	5026920	myself as a knowing thing. And then what it does is over time through learning, you get high
5026920	5032280	precision over the beliefs about that action in terms of the technical detail. And then that
5032280	5037000	becomes kind of the foundation on which you can then go and do more epistemic work. And then that
5038600	5045000	expertise development is stepwise, in a sense. I mean, you can picture it either way. But critically,
5045000	5049640	where we differ is that I'm arguing that actually in the moment of flow itself,
5050200	5055000	you're just garnering more evidence for the capacities and the policies that you already have.
5055320	5060360	So I'd like to start there and see what you think of that claim.
5063160	5070120	So we, as you point out, Leo Ferraro in Herobenidae, we argue something different,
5070760	5078520	which is why you're bringing it up. We argue that learning is inevitably occurring even in
5078520	5084440	the flow situation. And so there's improvement. And that's why if the environment doesn't have
5084520	5089960	the capacity to renew its challenges on you, you will very quickly fall out of the flow state.
5089960	5094200	So the argument is, well, why don't you just stay in the flow state? Well, the argument is,
5094200	5099800	because eventually you get a mastery over the environment, which means your skills start to
5099800	5106600	exceed the demands. And so phenomenologically, when I'm in the flow state, like inspiring or
5106600	5112760	lecturing, I'm finding tremendous amount of insight and innovation coming out.
5114840	5122520	Now, this is where it might get tricky, because is procedural innovation a restructuring of,
5122520	5129480	especially, is that a restructuring of your information and therefore have new capacities
5129480	5135720	in it, new emergent abilities? Or is it just a reinforcement? And I don't, we might get into
5135720	5145400	the thesis of ship here, which is problematic. But the one of the defining phenomenological
5145400	5152440	features of the flow state, and I want to be clear, I'm not pinning you down on this,
5152440	5157960	but I do think it's relevant evidence is the ongoing sense of discovery. There's a sense of
5157960	5163560	discovery there. There's a sense of coming to know things you did not know before. And of course,
5163560	5168360	when the flow state is in much more comprehensive expertise, not like the plain tennis or maybe
5168360	5172760	like just your optimal gripping on the world, people come to think they have learned something
5172760	5181400	deeply profound about reality. So I tend to think that there's evidence for transformative learning
5181400	5187640	happening up and beyond just reinforcement learning. Okay. Yeah, I like the return to the
5187640	5192040	phenomena. You know, Dreyfus has this phrase, which I will definitely use over and over again
5192040	5198360	in this podcast, which is when in doubt return to the phenomena. The way that we have cast it
5198920	5203960	is that there's this idea in the literature about a hyper prior that the world is changing. So that
5203960	5210120	we have a prior that the world is changing. And that is adapted for us because we don't get stuck
5210120	5215720	in the same free energy minima. Now, if that prior is always at play, what ends up happening
5215720	5222200	downstream on that is that my inference about my own abilities deteriorates over time. And we
5222200	5226520	experience that, I guess, I mean, like if I play tennis today, and then I play tennis in a week's
5226520	5230600	time, I'm probably going to have less fidelity in my own capacities in the week's time. And I do,
5230600	5238280	if I play tomorrow, having followed today. And so our argument is that the positive affect
5238280	5243880	that's part of the flow state is downstream on the surprise that's generated when you actually
5244440	5248280	violate that hyper prior that the world is changing. Because what you're getting evidence for is that
5248280	5251720	your policy still work in the world that you would have been for, you would have thought
5251720	5258120	didn't lend itself to your policies working. And there's this idea, Casper Hesp's paper and his
5258120	5264760	co-authors in 2021 that affect inactive inference is about basically your model doing better than
5264760	5270520	you thought it would do. And this actually comes a lot into what Mark talks about in terms of
5270520	5283800	aerodynamics. So I'm wondering, I don't know. Well, see, I think that's right. And the problem,
5283800	5288840	of course, is you can get an infinite regress. So well, I'll say, well, the things here, and you'll
5288840	5293720	say, well, there needs to be something a hyper prior behind that. And then we can, that's what I
5293720	5299480	mean about thesis is shit. So again, I would say, well, what are you getting better at? And what
5299480	5307320	you're getting better at, I would argue, is not stand like so expertise is generally built around
5308680	5315320	giving you a well, like a specific domain. We can talk about the possibility of sort of meta
5315320	5321480	expertise if you want. But what I mean by that is, once you've got expertise, you've gotten really
5321480	5327960	good at within a certain domain at formulating the problems you're fronting as for you, well
5328040	5333720	defined problems. That's one way in which an expert is sort of reliably different from a novice.
5333720	5337400	A novice goes in, this is no defined problem, the expert goes, it goes in, it's a, no, it's this
5337400	5342200	problem. And this is the right way to do this and this and this and this. Okay, so we agree with
5342200	5347400	that. But I think what's happening, right? And maybe this is the gray area between your position
5347400	5351320	in mind. I think what's happening is we're discovering new ways in which we can turn
5351320	5356280	well defined problem, sorry, ill defined states into well defined problems. But something's like,
5356360	5366840	I didn't realize I could adapt to that situation, but I can. And that sounds similar. But for me,
5366840	5373800	that's an insight experience. And that's what, like it's an insight flow, because you're getting
5373800	5379560	an extension of your cognitive capacity, because you have restructured what you take to be
5380520	5384280	like your, your problem formulation of the world. That's, that's,
5385640	5393240	yeah, I mean, to supplement that, I actually, I don't disagree on that note, but the way I would
5393240	5396840	formulate that, and this actually isn't in the paper. It's in the paper in some sense,
5396840	5399800	but it's not a fully fleshed out argument, because it wasn't hyper relevant.
5400440	5405160	I'm glad there's another really quality paper on flow. There's really nothing.
5405720	5410840	When we published the paper, we were literally the only paper talking about the cognitive
5410840	5417960	processes that work in flow. It's a bizarre one. There's very little on skillful coping,
5417960	5422840	generally, within cognitive science. But as I said, I think that's why I said there should be
5422840	5430920	more phenomenology active or cognitive science convergence. What we kind of mentioned in brief
5430920	5435960	is that flow, if we take the sort of macro perspective on what flow is, it can also be
5435960	5441240	this kind of humming between the pragmatic and the epistemic boundary. So maybe when you're
5441240	5450200	realizing, oh, I can reframe this kind of perplexing problem and actually something manageable,
5450200	5455400	what you're doing there is maybe just slightly x-ting the flow, doing some epistemic foraging,
5455400	5458520	returning, because something I want to make really clear to everyone listening as well.
5459240	5464360	When we talk about epistemic action and pragmatic action in terms of expected free energy or active
5464360	5471160	inference, it's not like the agent goes, I'm doing pragmatic action right now. It's part
5471160	5479160	of the actual maths. If you look at the maths, firstly, you can do a bit of both at the same
5479160	5484440	time. That's a thing. But it's also like the action policies that we're talking about here,
5484520	5491560	John and I, these are not protracted seven hours of just like pragmatic action. No,
5491560	5495720	these have to be very temporally thin because the world is volatile. The world is constantly
5495720	5500600	changing. And so you have to be able to not just pin all your hopes or pull your eggs in one basket
5500600	5505880	in terms of an action policy. And so actually fundamentally, our divergence might well be
5505880	5511080	a semantic thing, which is that I'm talking very much about the synchronic nature of being in flow
5511080	5517400	right now. And for simplicity, I have that boundary between pragmatic and epistemic,
5517400	5523960	whereas if you take a more macro perspective, as that flow state, as the concerto unfolds,
5523960	5526360	you could be humming at that boundary and doing learning as well.
5527240	5532280	Yeah, I really look forward to your paper because I think that sounds like actually
5532840	5538840	a powerful way in which the theories could be integrated together. I'm also interested in
5538840	5543240	the question that's emerging out of this, well, I've already been interested in the question,
5543240	5547880	but it emerges out of what we're talking about. Because I'm interested because I think there's,
5547880	5556680	there might be an additional thing. Because there's, you can flow in a situation and it
5556680	5561240	doesn't transfer, it doesn't transfer to other domains, video game addiction is the classic
5561240	5565080	model, you can flow in the game, you can't flow in the world. So you get depressed in the world,
5565080	5568120	you can flow in the game and so you want to stay in the game more and more and more.
5569960	5574280	That's very different than how I flow in Tai Chi Chuan. Tai Chi Chuan, in fact,
5574280	5578680	other people pointed this out in me, the flow states that I cultivate in Tai Chi Chuan,
5578680	5583480	I can, they are cultivated in such a way that they transfer broadly and deeply to many other
5583480	5590920	domains. And I'm interested in this sort of ritual framework, because what you get is this
5590920	5597240	ritual and this philosophical framework, Taoism and other, other practices and ecology of practices
5597240	5606840	around so that it broadens, like it transfers in powerful ways. And I'm wondering what the
5606840	5612680	differences are. And also if, how does that show up? Is there a phenomenological difference?
5613640	5620600	I mean, so now really, really, really weakly, anecdotally, right, in terms of phenomenological
5620600	5626680	practice, I do get a sense of a difference between what I'm just flowing and what I'm flowing in a
5626680	5633000	ritual context. So if I enter into a violin hall, and let's say I'm an expert in playing the violin,
5633560	5638600	and I see a crowd and I see my violin and I see the whole stage, what I end up getting is this,
5639320	5645640	so habits are quite well codified within active inference, you get this kind of contextual cue
5645640	5649080	that like in layman's touch, although this isn't, we're saying this isn't happening propositionally,
5649800	5655400	it's time for me to play the violin. And this can look like precision over beliefs about your own
5655400	5661160	action. So what, this is again, not something I've thought about necessarily with any depth,
5661160	5664840	because this is just something that you've brought up. I'm wondering whether that contextual cue,
5664840	5667800	what you're happening when you're doing Tai Chi and then maybe what you're doing when you're
5667800	5678840	lecturing is that your system is seeing similarities in the context and doing similar precision
5678840	5685560	weighting in a separate domain. Yeah, I think that's right. And I think what philosophical
5685560	5694360	frameworks do is they reverse engineer that. They try to find out what might be similar,
5694440	5700520	or maybe even invariant across many contexts, and then build that back into the specific context
5700520	5706680	in which you are doing the practice to exactly afford that transfer appropriate processing.
5706680	5711240	I think that's right. I think there's something else also going on with the cueing, and this goes
5711240	5718600	into Aptur's metamotivational theory. We can be broadly speaking, we frame our arousal in two
5718600	5725000	different ways. When we're in italic mode and we're working towards, where the reward is found
5725000	5731160	in the external goal, then increased effort is experienced as frustration and then it increases
5731160	5736120	too much of getting anxiety. But if I'm doing something where the goal is the behavior itself,
5736120	5740920	like making love or doing poetry, then the increased, not infinitely obviously, but the
5740920	5748840	increased arousal is framed as positive, as excitement. And so I think also, and so Aptur
5748840	5757240	talks about safety framing. Let's call the first italic mode work and the peritolic mode
5759560	5764360	a play. I think ritual has to do with serious play, and I've got a whole argument about that.
5764360	5769400	But I think also what you're doing in the context is you're trying to cue people into the play mode
5770120	5777160	because the play mode allows them to model themselves, their arousal, as positive,
5777800	5782600	rather than as negative. And that allows them, and I think there's a deep connection between
5782600	5788760	this peritolic framing and Csikszentmihais, I think accurate claim that flow is autotelic,
5788760	5794520	doing it for its own sake. Right. Yeah, cool. Yeah, I like the notion of effort here.
5795480	5799560	Recognize that one of the fundamental factors or fundamental characteristics of flow is
5800360	5805560	perceived effortlessness. Yes, even though you can, even though you can have sort of very
5806280	5812760	peripheral cues that you might be expending a lot of metabolic energy. Exactly. And just for the,
5813320	5817800	given this is the Active Inference Institute's podcast, just for those interested in the
5817800	5822760	computational framing of that within Active Inference, Thomas Parr has got a paper out this
5822760	5828200	year on cognitive effort and Active Inference. So that gives a kind of nice computational
5828200	5833160	modeling picture of that, which actually leads me to a much broader question because I know we're,
5833160	5839240	we haven't got too much more time, which is I've noticed in myself to be totally candid that I've
5839240	5845960	started, like I learned about flow and Csikszentmihais through you and through other people,
5845960	5852440	but mainly as a philosophical notion. And now I'm viewing it as a computational notion.
5852440	5859800	Yes. Do you worry about that? Do you worry that if we rely too much on computation, not just
5859800	5866840	computational models, but maths, physics, we in some ways reduce the phenomena in a way that's
5866840	5872440	detrimental, not just because it's not romantic or that it's, but like that we're missing something
5872440	5878280	fundamentally? Well, it depends. I mean, that's a really important question. We could do two hours
5878280	5885320	on just that question. But if you think that a leveled ontology is actually the way ontology is,
5886760	5891080	that the level at which we do science is as ontologically real as the quantum level we
5891080	5894520	discover when we're doing science. And I think you have to come to that conclusion.
5894520	5900520	Right. And I have extended arguments for that elsewhere. Then you can make a clean philosophical
5900520	5905080	distinction between explaining a way in a reductive fashion and explaining that actually
5905080	5911160	enriches your appreciation for the phenomena. Now, if the computational stuff, the computational
5911160	5915800	stuff to my mind, well, let's say what the argument we were just exploring has merit,
5916440	5919960	then notice what we were saying. We're saying, well, what the computational modeling actually does
5919960	5925800	is actually shows why this sometimes very obscure philosophical framework is really important.
5925800	5931800	It's actually doing some really important work. And you can't get rid of it. You can't dispense with
5932200	5939400	it. And that would mean that some of the stuff we're doing, where we're trying to commodify flow
5939400	5945560	and take it out of those frameworks and do the thing we do and sell books.
5948200	5954280	It's actually misrepresenting the phenomena in a way that we can philosophically and scientifically
5954280	5959880	critique. It's like, wait, wait, this phenomena has the power it has, because Chick-Mat St.
5960200	5965960	said it's an evolutionary market for adaptivity. And then, well, making it adaptive is how broadly
5965960	5970600	and deeply is it transferring out of the situation. And then the philosophical framework really
5970600	5976840	matters to what it is and how it functions. And so if you can make a distinction and you need
5976840	5980200	an ontological distinction to make this distinction, but if you can make a distinction
5980200	5986680	between explaining and explaining a way, then I think it's possible to say, no, no,
5986680	5992600	when I do these things. And to be fair to me, there's, I got a lot of people who, you know,
5992600	5996760	from various religious and spiritual backgrounds, and they come in and they say, thank you so much
5996760	6003480	for your work. I now, I much better appreciate this, this experience or that experience or the
6003480	6009480	flow state or this mystical state, because you didn't try and tell me it's nothing. But you
6009480	6014280	tried to say, this is what it's doing. And this is why you like it and value it so much.
6014280	6020440	But do you think your work, to kind of, yeah, to look at that personal vantage point, do you
6020440	6028520	think you've managed to keep, like, because if I, without being sort of embarrassingly lording,
6029560	6035480	people should watch Awakening from the Meaning Crisis, not only for the content, but also just
6035480	6041480	the way you present it, which is just so magical. So thanks. I mean, it's really inspired a lot of
6041480	6047640	the way that I think science should be done and philosophy should be done. What, what is it about,
6047640	6052280	I think, you know, anyone who watches that recognizes there's something kind of special
6052280	6056920	going on there. The ideas are living through you, you're, they're breathing through you,
6056920	6060680	you're breathing through them, there's this really beautiful coupling. Again, we'll come back to that
6060680	6069960	between you and the ideas. What, what is it about that kind of synthesis of the philosophy and the
6070040	6076600	sort of more hard cognitive science? Do you think made that project so successful?
6078920	6083960	I suppose it's a view of the role of cognitive science, what cognitive science is doing.
6087240	6090840	I think what cognitive science does is it's,
6093720	6099480	well, I'll try and do it sort of narratively. And I do this in the series. I think, you know,
6100680	6104280	even the notion of mind that we've been invoking mind and cognition is equivocal,
6105080	6112120	because it means one thing to the neuroscientists who study the brain and looking at neurons and
6112120	6115720	anatomical networks and perhaps functional networks. It means a different thing to the
6115720	6121400	artificial intelligence person who's building algorithms and heuristics and doing reinforcement
6121400	6125480	learning and blah, blah. It means a different thing to the psychologists who study human behavior
6125480	6129720	with experiments and running stats. And they talk about working memory. They don't talk so much
6130120	6133000	right. And it means a different thing to the linguists and a different thing to the cultural
6133000	6136520	anthropologists. By the way, I include them because they were the people that have been
6136520	6141560	studying distributed cognition and collective intelligence. They matter. Yeah. If you think
6141560	6145480	about it on this analogy, it's like they're different countries speaking different languages.
6145480	6151880	And here's the thing that has great value. Specialization has great value. I'm not dismissing
6151880	6157880	that. I am not dismissing that. But each one of these is talking about a different level. And
6157880	6163640	here's what I think I would state as a very plausible claim. I think it's unlikely that these
6163640	6169800	levels in reality, the brain information processing, behavioral, linguistic, sociocultural levels
6169800	6174680	are independent from each other. I think they causal influence and constrain each other.
6174680	6181800	So we are missing something important about the mind by not getting clear about the relationship
6181800	6187480	between these levels. We can be equivocating and we have a fragmented notion if we don't capture
6187880	6193480	the relations of constraint and causation between these different levels of cognition and mind.
6194040	6201160	And so I think the proper function of cognitive science is to use philosophy's skills of
6202360	6209240	creating bridging discourses, creating bridging conceptual vocabulary, theoretical grammar,
6209240	6215480	so that these different disciplines can talk to each other in reciprocally reconstructive ways
6215560	6221640	as a way of converging on the causal and constraint relationships between the levels,
6221640	6228200	rather than trying to compete or say the bottom level is the only real level. So that for me,
6228200	6233320	they all live together. They are doing, and I'm sorry to evoke it again, they're doing
6233320	6242680	opponent processing between each other. And that's what inhabits me when I'm doing cognitive
6242680	6247320	science, that vision. I call it synoptic integration. Yeah, it's, well, it's wonderful to see.
6249080	6255240	So, I mean, like, I think we, I mean, that's the cognitive scientists that I'm aspiring to be.
6255240	6259320	I think you've called it a big picture cognitive scientist as well. Yes. And one of the things,
6259320	6263880	one of the, and I felt very lonely for a while, you know, I was doing relevance realization,
6263880	6270040	which is a big picture. And then, to my great delight, another big picture for ecocide down
6270040	6275720	the road. And then to my even greater happiness, another big picture came down the road,
6275720	6281560	which is, you know, the predictive processing framework. And I think they are more convergent
6281560	6287800	than adversarial. And I, well, you've heard me arguing about how we can integrate them together.
6287800	6293800	Excellent. Yeah, I would say maybe it's just bias. Active inferences or physics processing is a
6293800	6300200	big picture cognitive scientist from the physics and the maths, all the way, well, what we're
6300200	6306120	trying to do to the phenomena, to what it is like to be a, to be a human being, to have conversations
6306120	6311880	like this. John, it's, it was, you know, I can't say it was better than I expected,
6311880	6317560	because I knew it was going to be wonderful, but you're full of just thrilling insights and
6318200	6321640	speaking to you, listening to you is always such a wonderful learning experience.
6321640	6329400	Where that happens in flow or without flow. But I just wanted to thank you so very much for,
6329400	6335560	I know you're extremely busy, but for giving us your time. Where can people find you? What have
6335560	6341880	you got coming up? I'm sure people are curious. So the most immediate thing for this conversation
6342760	6348200	is the talk I gave at Leiden on the predictive processing symposium. It's up on my channel.
6348280	6351720	I think it's the second most recent video on my channel on YouTube.
6351720	6356840	We can put it in the video. Yeah. Where I try to go into the nuts and bolts of how you could
6356840	6362280	integrate predictive processing and relevance realisation theory together. So people might find
6362280	6368040	that. And I've got a lot of good feedback on that for being sort of clear and a good argument.
6368920	6376040	So I would recommend that when people are interested in the broader implications of this
6376120	6383240	awakening for the meeting crisis and then after Socrates also after Socrates is where I take all
6383240	6387720	of this and all of this stuff and how do you turn it into practices in order to overcome
6387720	6393640	self deception and enhance relevance realisation become more wise and virtuous. And so they can
6393640	6401560	take a look there. The arguments around neoplatonism. There are several videos around that. I try to
6401640	6407320	connect neoplatonism to foreecogsci and relevance realisation and predictive processing as we
6407320	6413240	saw in this podcast. But in the neoplatonism I'm working on my third big series. Walking the
6413240	6418680	philosophical Silk Road which will be on Zen neoplatonism. Trying to see if we can bring
6418680	6423400	an integration, an opponent processing, not an adversarial one, an opponent processing between
6423960	6430520	Zen and neoplatonism to give us a rich philosophical framework by which like the philosophical road
6430520	6439080	we can trade ideas and move between worlds without having to descend into well tribalism
6439080	6444920	and other such things. Wonderful, wonderful. Well, again, it was absolutely my pleasure.
6444920	6448600	I apologise. I've got a slight cold. So if I've been a little sniffly or nasal,
6451400	6456360	we can blame it on the London weather. But I'd love to have you back on. At some point
6457240	6462440	your work is truly inspiring. So thank you so much, John, for me and the Institute.
6463400	6470520	Thank you, Doris. I'm happy to come back on. If it turns out that Mark and I come on together,
6470520	6474120	that would be thrilling as well. Great. We will definitely get that sorted. All right, thank you.
6475320	6479320	Thank you.
