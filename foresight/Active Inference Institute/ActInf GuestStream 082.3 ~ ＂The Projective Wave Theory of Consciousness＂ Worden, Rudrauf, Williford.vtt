Hello and welcome, everyone. It's July 22nd, 2024. This is Active Inference guest stream

00:15.200 --> 00:23.400
82.3. The Projective Wave Theory of Consciousness. Robert Warden will give a presentation and

00:23.400 --> 00:28.920
we have several others to join and comment and give their insights. So thank you everyone

00:28.920 --> 00:34.360
for joining and Robert, please begin the presentation. And also, Robert, close the YouTube on your

00:34.360 --> 00:35.440
side. All good.

00:35.440 --> 00:39.320
It's Active Inference guest stream 82.3.

00:39.320 --> 00:39.840
Right.

00:39.840 --> 00:45.400
I've objectively, it's coming through on my loud speaker, which is a problem.

00:45.400 --> 00:47.960
Yeah, it's all good. Like, all good.

00:58.920 --> 01:27.240
Okay. So this is a talk about the Projective Wave Theory of Consciousness. And there's

01:27.400 --> 01:33.080
already a paper about it on Archive this month. So you can look at the paper if you like.

01:33.080 --> 01:40.440
But let me start by describing roughly the roadmap for the talk. The Projective Wave

01:40.440 --> 01:46.200
Theory is very closely related to the Projective Consciousness Model, PCM. And we're fortunate

01:46.200 --> 01:51.880
to have three of the authors of that model on the call today. But I'm going to give this talk

01:52.120 --> 01:59.960
in four different parts. The first part is talking about data. And the idea is that any theory of

01:59.960 --> 02:06.200
consciousness has to fit the data, has to fit some data in order for us to believe it. And so the

02:06.200 --> 02:11.800
question is, what kinds of data is there about consciousness that the theory has to fit? And I

02:11.800 --> 02:18.120
should be arguing that the main kind of data we have is spatial consciousness. So that's part one

02:18.840 --> 02:23.400
of the talk. Part two, I shall talk about the Projective Consciousness Model, PCM. And to my

02:23.400 --> 02:29.480
mind, the big virtue of the PCM is that it does predict account for just that, the spatial nature

02:29.480 --> 02:35.880
of consciousness. And in that, it's a great deal. It does a great deal better than many neural theories

02:35.880 --> 02:42.680
of consciousness. And I shall probably pause at that point after parts one and two and have

02:42.680 --> 02:49.960
discussion about the first two points there. But before that, I think the PCM has great

02:49.960 --> 02:56.280
strengths. But I think in common with all neural theories of consciousness, it has three problems.

02:56.280 --> 03:01.160
And I shall talk about what those problems are. But I shall emphasize that those problems are not

03:01.160 --> 03:09.080
specific to the PCM. If you buy into the classical neural model of the brain that neurons do everything,

03:09.080 --> 03:13.000
then whatever your theory of consciousness, I think you're going to have these problems.

03:13.000 --> 03:18.440
And so in order to get out of those problems, we have to do something that's not in the classical

03:18.440 --> 03:23.960
neural model that assumes that neurons in the brain do everything. So we have to add something

03:23.960 --> 03:30.280
to the PCM. And the something we have to add is there in three. The assumption we're going to add

03:30.280 --> 03:35.080
to it is quite a big one. It's an assumption that there is a wave in the brain which stores

03:35.080 --> 03:41.640
3D spatial information. In other words, neurons don't do everything. And then part four of the

03:42.520 --> 03:47.880
talk, I shall bring those two and three together to a projective wave theory of consciousness.

03:47.880 --> 03:53.400
And talk a little bit about firstly, how it solves the neural problems, but secondly,

03:53.400 --> 03:58.520
how it fits the data and some more general considerations about it. So that is the root

03:58.520 --> 04:07.720
map of the talk. So we start off with what are the reasons to believe some theory, whether

04:07.720 --> 04:12.840
there's theory of consciousness or anything else. Why do we believe it? Basically, we believe a

04:12.840 --> 04:18.760
theory because it fits data. And it there's a complexity measure here that needs to fit more

04:18.760 --> 04:23.720
data, which you can measure in bits, if you like, than the complexity of the assumptions you put

04:23.720 --> 04:28.040
into it. If you just put in a huge number of assumptions and fit a small amount of data,

04:28.040 --> 04:33.720
that's no use. So there's a kind of Bayesian balance between the assumptions you put into a

04:33.720 --> 04:39.640
theory and the data it fits. And I've illustrated the Bayesian balance, a pair of scales here. And

04:39.640 --> 04:47.000
I've measured the complexity of the theory and the amount of data it tests by a so-called zip

04:47.000 --> 04:52.280
test, which simply says you describe these things in text files, you zip them up and you see how big

04:52.360 --> 04:58.040
they are. So established theories in science like a theory of physics or chemistry have a hugely

04:58.040 --> 05:03.080
positive Bayesian balance. They have quite few assumptions and they account for huge amounts

05:03.080 --> 05:08.440
of data. So how can we get to that point with the theory of consciousness? How can a theory of

05:08.440 --> 05:14.840
consciousness produce a positive Bayesian balance between its assumption and the data it accounts

05:14.840 --> 05:21.640
for? So the question arises, what is the data we have to test theories of consciousness? And there's

05:21.640 --> 05:26.280
a big problem, which is well known, that consciousness is a private experience. So there's not much

05:26.280 --> 05:32.120
public data about it. But there are several kinds of data we can use, such as data about levels of

05:32.120 --> 05:39.000
consciousness, alertness and being asleep and so on, data about quality. And they are problematic

05:39.000 --> 05:45.560
because they're private phenomena. But nevertheless, two people can agree something about similarity

05:45.560 --> 05:52.760
scales of their quality, like different colors being similar or different. And the form C is the

05:52.760 --> 05:59.720
shapes of things in spatial consciousness. And I shall argue that the main manifestation of

05:59.720 --> 06:06.520
consciousness, which we have, what we're experiencing right now, is a 3D spatial model of the world

06:06.520 --> 06:14.440
around us. And that 3D model is very detailed and quite faithful to the real world around us.

06:14.440 --> 06:22.440
And so that has a large information content. Going down the list, there's conscious imagination,

06:22.440 --> 06:27.240
there is consciousness of the self, there are anomalies and illusions of consciousness,

06:27.240 --> 06:32.440
and there is the hard problem, if you like, the existence of consciousness itself. Now I shall

06:32.440 --> 06:39.560
argue that point C, the shape of spatial consciousness gives us much more data to test any theory

06:39.560 --> 06:46.200
than any other type of data. So what's the testable data in spatial consciousness?

06:48.920 --> 06:53.720
Spatial consciousness is like a 3D model of the real world around you. That's what you're

06:54.520 --> 07:00.600
experiencing right now. And it has a lot of the geometry of the real world, and particularly

07:00.600 --> 07:06.600
straight lines in consciousness correspond to straight lines in the real world. And you can

07:06.600 --> 07:12.040
test this. I won't go into the years of how. So this agreement between our conscious experience,

07:12.040 --> 07:16.920
which is quite information rich, and the real world around us, which is obviously information

07:16.920 --> 07:23.480
risk, gives a lot of data to test any theory of consciousness. And I suggest roughly it gives

07:23.480 --> 07:30.120
us thousands of bits, even in a few seconds. And I shall suggest that no other form of data

07:30.120 --> 07:35.080
about consciousness comes anywhere close to this in terms of testable information content.

07:36.040 --> 07:41.240
So if you really want to prove your theories right, then it's got to account for the spatial

07:41.240 --> 07:46.760
form of consciousness if you're going to believe it. And down at the right here, I put my conclusion

07:46.760 --> 07:52.040
that spatial consciousness is, if you like, the element in the room, consciousness theory.

07:54.200 --> 08:00.760
So we have to consider how the brain does spatial cognition. And all animal brains pretty much do

08:00.760 --> 08:07.400
that. They have to understand 3D's local space for a very fundamental reason, just to control

08:07.400 --> 08:11.960
their every movement, to move every movement of their limbs, they have to understand 3D space

08:11.960 --> 08:17.160
around them. And there's been huge selection pressure to do this well. And we believe that

08:17.160 --> 08:23.720
animals do it very well, even insects do it quite well. And also it appears that most of the animal

08:23.720 --> 08:30.280
brain is devoted to that. Now, if we assume a Bayesian hypothesis about cognition, then the way

08:30.280 --> 08:35.800
animals do that is to build a maximum likelihood 3D model of local space in their brains from their

08:36.360 --> 08:43.560
sense data. So it becomes fairly natural to expect that spatial consciousness is going to be linked

08:43.560 --> 08:49.320
to this spatial model. And the question is, is it a purely neural model as a classical neural

08:49.320 --> 08:55.960
models of the brain? And if it is, how does neuron firing represent 3D space? And this is quite a

08:55.960 --> 09:05.000
difficult problem. And really, there are very few viable solutions to it. But I shall switch now,

09:05.000 --> 09:10.200
I shall put that problem on one side and switch to the Projective Consciousness Model, PCM,

09:10.200 --> 09:15.400
which has been developed by David and has collaborated since about 2017, and it's built on the

09:15.400 --> 09:20.200
free energy principle. So it's based on a Bayesian model of local space in the brain.

09:20.440 --> 09:27.080
And for its neural process model, it assumes the process model of the free energy principle.

09:27.880 --> 09:35.640
And so the PCM assumes that the brain holds a 3D projective transform model of local Euclidean

09:35.640 --> 09:42.040
space. And the key thing is that PCM then predicts that spatial consciousness is like

09:42.040 --> 09:47.640
that model. And this is a very good prediction. It agrees very well with data. For instance,

09:47.640 --> 09:51.640
the trivial fact that straight lines in your consciousness are straight lines in the real

09:51.640 --> 09:58.920
world. So the PCM has a good Bayesian balance. I should say this is very distinctive amongst

09:58.920 --> 10:03.640
many theories of consciousness. Very few of them talk about the spatial nature of consciousness.

10:03.640 --> 10:08.200
And if they do, they probably treat it as a bit of an afterthought. But the PCM puts it

10:09.240 --> 10:14.200
out in the front. And I think that's a very positive feature of it. And it has a good Bayesian

10:14.200 --> 10:19.080
balance. And it does make various other predictions which people have talked about in the papers,

10:19.800 --> 10:24.200
makes predictions about illusions of consciousness, and makes predictions about

10:24.200 --> 10:30.520
predictive imagination and planning actions. Now, I don't think those are quite as significant

10:31.080 --> 10:36.280
in the Bayesian balance in the agreement with the data as the basic agreement with the

10:36.280 --> 10:45.240
form of consciousness right now. Consciousness from sense data. But I shall say the PCM has

10:45.240 --> 10:51.560
three difficulties. I shall emphasize they're not difficulties of the PCM alone. I believe

10:51.560 --> 10:57.000
they are difficulties of any neural theory of consciousness. And I'll just list them briefly

10:57.000 --> 11:01.000
here because there's going to be a slide describing them. The first difficulty is neural

11:01.000 --> 11:06.840
selection. How do we pick out just those neurons which cause consciousness from all the others that

11:06.840 --> 11:13.000
don't? And the second one is neural precision and speed. We know that our conscious model of space

11:13.000 --> 11:18.840
is a very detailed and precise one. Can you do that with neuron firing? I would suggest you can't.

11:19.640 --> 11:25.160
And the third one is a complex decoding problem that, anyway, I'll come onto that.

11:25.160 --> 11:29.640
So I'll describe these three in a minute. But the emphasis is that they are not just problems

11:29.720 --> 11:34.920
of the PCM. They are difficulties for any neural theory of consciousness, for instance, IIT or

11:34.920 --> 11:42.040
global neural workspace theory and so on. So what are the three difficulties? The neural

11:42.040 --> 11:46.920
selection problem. Most neurons in the brain are not linked to consciousness. We know that from

11:46.920 --> 11:52.600
cortical lesions, we don't interrupt consciousness, or the cerebellum, or Bjorn Merkur has written

11:52.600 --> 11:58.040
quite extensively about this. But neuron theories of consciousness say that the activity of some

11:58.040 --> 12:03.160
neurons causes consciousness and not others. So the question is how are those special neurons

12:03.160 --> 12:08.920
selected? And as far as I know, there's no sound physical basis to pick out some neurons from

12:08.920 --> 12:14.200
all the others. So you build in some selection assumptions into your hypothesis, but those

12:14.200 --> 12:20.440
form a debit in your Bayesian balance. So they're a debit for any neural theory of consciousness.

12:21.400 --> 12:32.120
The second difficulty is how do neurons represent space? Now, there are several possible ways of

12:32.120 --> 12:37.720
having neurons representing 3D space. You can represent 2D space, all right? Can you return to

12:37.720 --> 12:43.000
sharing the screen? Oh, sorry, I've lost sharing, have I? All good.

12:51.400 --> 13:09.160
So how do neurons represent 3D space? There are several ways they might do it, but they all have

13:09.160 --> 13:15.640
problems of precision and speed. For instance, there is a Bayesian computational model of how

13:15.640 --> 13:22.040
animals build 3D internal model of space from their sense data. And this is already on one of the

13:22.040 --> 13:28.360
AI live streams that this YouTube address. But that model shows that in order to build a 3D model

13:28.360 --> 13:35.720
of space, even for a small animal like a bee, you need memory storage errors to be roughly the order

13:35.720 --> 13:42.920
1% as small as that. Whereas if you model neurons accurately, properly, they don't give you this

13:42.920 --> 13:51.800
precision because in a neuron, most theoretical models of neurons are ideal abstract neurons whose

13:51.800 --> 13:58.600
outputs are real variables of high precision. And that's shown in the top of this picture here.

13:58.600 --> 14:04.840
Whereas actually, neurons' outputs are spike trains, which in a short time scale gives very

14:04.840 --> 14:09.720
limited precision. For instance, in a fifth of the second possible time scale for consciousness,

14:10.680 --> 14:17.800
you may get about 10 pulses. And that gives you a precision of only 30% in that time scale.

14:17.800 --> 14:23.560
So the precision you get from neural representations is very different from what you need to build

14:23.560 --> 14:29.880
a decent 3D model or what we experience in consciousness. And this, I think, hasn't been

14:29.880 --> 14:34.440
really spotted very much because most of the neural models that you see in the literature,

14:34.440 --> 14:38.600
they don't model spike trains. It's different enough to model networks of neurons. And so

14:38.840 --> 14:45.160
they use abstract, precise neurons. So that's the second difficulty. How can neurons store

14:45.160 --> 14:50.760
precise and responsive, fast model of 3D space like the one we experience?

14:52.200 --> 15:00.840
Finally, can you see that change? Third difficulty? The third difficulty is what I call the hard

15:00.840 --> 15:07.560
triangle because conscious experience, which is C in this picture here, is a faithful, hardly

15:07.560 --> 15:13.720
distorted model of the real world. There's the real world, A, and there's consciousness

15:13.720 --> 15:20.840
awareness, C. But what the models we have found in the brain are two-dimensional models and very

15:20.840 --> 15:26.680
distorted models. And so they're many different models, and they're highly complex encoding to

15:26.680 --> 15:34.040
get from A to B. So if you want to get back from B to C, you have to do very complex decoding to

15:34.040 --> 15:41.320
undo all the complex coding that most species brains do. And so ABC is the hard triangle.

15:42.120 --> 15:48.120
You have to have complex decoding assumptions in any neural theory of consciousness. And the

15:48.120 --> 15:53.800
worst thing of that maybe is that the decoding has to be species specific. It can't be universal

15:53.800 --> 16:02.280
decoding. So those are the three difficulties for any neural theory of consciousness, including the

16:02.280 --> 16:11.000
PCM, I believe. So that's where we've got to. I've covered topics one and two of this talk,

16:11.000 --> 16:14.600
and now I think we'll break for any discussion or contributions.

16:19.000 --> 16:26.200
Thank you very much, Robert, for your presentation up to now. I can follow it very well. I think

16:26.840 --> 16:33.640
you point out very important issues. I should say, and perhaps we scan,

16:34.360 --> 16:42.920
that from the standpoint of the PCM, even though indeed we have framed it in the context of active

16:42.920 --> 16:49.560
influence and more specifically the free energy principle, we do not necessarily

16:50.520 --> 17:00.600
entail, it does not necessarily entail that we buy or we endorse or we believe in

17:02.440 --> 17:09.320
the current neural network models that are used in this context. Personally, I've been a neuroscientist

17:09.320 --> 17:16.360
for many years. I've done a lot of electrophysiology, lesion work with human patients. Also, I worked

17:16.360 --> 17:22.040
with rodent. I've done a lot of functionally maging and modeling. At some point in my career,

17:22.040 --> 17:27.240
I thought that I did not understand the brain well enough, and I stopped doing neuroscience. I stopped

17:27.240 --> 17:35.160
carrying quote-unquote about the brain. For us, what is the most important in the PCM at this point

17:35.160 --> 17:41.400
is all you said, is that we can capture some aspect of this phenomenology that seems essential,

17:41.480 --> 17:47.160
et cetera, et cetera. Personally, I have given up at this point trying to

17:49.880 --> 17:59.640
devise or figure out any realistic neural network models. When you take just one neuron,

17:59.640 --> 18:09.080
as you said, Robert, it's a universe. You just think about how receptors are

18:09.320 --> 18:14.760
or downregulated through fast gene expression or dendritic trees and their complexities

18:14.760 --> 18:23.640
and their geometry plays a role in computation. I don't believe that the spiking of the neurons,

18:23.640 --> 18:28.360
which we often call the output of the neuron, are necessarily where we should be looking at.

18:29.400 --> 18:36.760
I don't know where we should be looking at. I committed an odd paper a long time ago in 2015,

18:37.560 --> 18:44.120
in which I kind of said, well, I explained why I had given up hope at this point about brain

18:44.120 --> 18:48.840
science to account for that, because I think we don't understand the brain. I think they are

18:48.840 --> 18:57.560
principle we haven't figured out yet by far. My guess was that a bit like by analogy with

18:57.560 --> 19:03.400
computer science, there are layers of abstraction, mechanism of virtualization that hide the detail

19:03.400 --> 19:10.600
of the hardware, which we don't understand at all. And so far, it's a very open-ended thing.

19:10.600 --> 19:17.160
So to me, what matters the most about the PCM at this point is with respect to the brain,

19:17.160 --> 19:22.360
it is neutral. We don't know. At this point, I have absolutely no hypothesis, except very

19:22.360 --> 19:28.760
gross anatomy of hypothesis, but also possible details about, but you're right,

19:29.320 --> 19:34.360
that's the hard problem. And personally, I have given up on trying to account for it.

19:36.120 --> 19:43.080
Thanks, David. I find so much to agree with there. And so, yeah, we don't understand what's going on

19:43.080 --> 19:48.520
in the brain. Maybe neurons are doing something much more complicated than simple spike trains,

19:48.520 --> 19:55.240
but maybe there's also this wave, and we'll talk about that. Carl, Ken, do you have any comments

19:55.240 --> 20:02.920
on this thing? Carl, you want to go ahead? Or I can, if you don't mind, I'll just follow up with,

20:03.560 --> 20:13.320
I completely agree with what David said. And I will say my own sort of approach to the problem has

20:13.320 --> 20:20.120
always been sort of agnostic about the underlying realization. So I've kind of started from,

20:20.840 --> 20:27.080
in my own thinking anyway, always from the point of view of phenomenology with some kind of,

20:29.160 --> 20:36.840
you might say, general acceptance of some sort of physicalism, but agnostic about the details of

20:36.840 --> 20:44.680
that physicalism. So agnostic about whether it's exactly what goes on in the brain or what level

20:44.680 --> 20:53.080
and so on. I guess I've tended to, even though I agree you can't exclude it a priori, I've tended

20:53.080 --> 20:57.720
to kind of think, well, quantum mechanical theories are probably barking up the wrong tree,

20:58.360 --> 21:05.400
but that's just like my gut on that. And then I'm sorry, personally, Ken, at this point,

21:05.400 --> 21:09.560
I'm so confused about the brain and about the physical nature of the universe that

21:09.960 --> 21:13.320
I'm even totally open that the whole thing is quantum. I have no idea.

21:13.880 --> 21:20.280
Okay. Yeah, as I said, it's just sort of like my gut on that, but not, I can't really defend it

21:21.640 --> 21:29.400
in detail for a number of reasons, going to my own ignorance. But and I would just add that,

21:29.960 --> 21:37.400
and I agree, I think the way you presented the PCM, generally was exactly right. You did mention

21:37.480 --> 21:46.200
that we do have something to say about imagination, like action planning, and about anomalies and

21:46.200 --> 21:53.400
illusions. And we, you know, we agree with you, I think that the main set of data we aim to capture

21:53.400 --> 22:01.400
are the spatial component of consciousness and the perspectival spatial component, like,

22:01.400 --> 22:06.440
you know, the project, what we use, projective geometry to capture. But then we do try to,

22:06.440 --> 22:15.160
as you know, try to derive certain other bits of parts of the relevant data from that basis. So

22:15.160 --> 22:22.040
accounting for illusions, like the moon illusion and the aims room illusion, and accounting for

22:23.880 --> 22:31.560
imaginative action planning. And also, I should add some data about self awareness. So we have

22:31.640 --> 22:41.080
paper on self awareness in this context as well. So, yeah, I think that's all I got so far. But

22:41.080 --> 22:47.000
this is this has been very interesting so far. Thanks again. Come on.

22:49.720 --> 22:56.280
How can I make any comments? No, I'm just enjoying this as a spectator,

22:56.840 --> 23:04.200
batting for both sides. One comment, it seems to me that we're focusing on the distinction between

23:05.080 --> 23:13.640
principles on about how the brain makes sense of its world and the process theories that attend

23:13.640 --> 23:20.040
those principles in terms of instantiation. And there's an agnostic approach I think you can take

23:20.040 --> 23:28.360
in relation to process theories. So I'm interested to see how much Robert's focus will be on the

23:28.360 --> 23:39.720
process theory and the actual substrates, which I think is interesting from the point of view of

23:40.680 --> 23:50.840
actually simulating this kind of inference and also being able to reproduce it in silico in

23:50.840 --> 23:59.800
terms of creating a kind of artificial intelligence that has this kind of competence. So there may

23:59.800 --> 24:07.400
be a more pragmatic focus. I was intrigued by the previous slide, this hard triangle.

24:07.800 --> 24:25.640
Yeah, just go to it there. Yeah, I didn't quite resonate with this. I think for a start the

24:25.640 --> 24:33.240
notions of encoding and decoding for people like me should be usefully unpacked. So everything in

24:33.240 --> 24:41.800
terms of belief updating is some kind of mapping or morphism or relationship. So I'm assuming...

24:41.800 --> 24:50.840
Mapping is a good word for it. Yeah. Okay, so the world generates sensory inputs and then the brain

24:53.320 --> 25:00.840
represents those inputs. I mean, for B, you just imagine the visual cortex with a highly distorted

25:01.640 --> 25:07.000
version of space in it, all around the fovea and so on, and all the other cortical maps,

25:07.000 --> 25:12.440
a highly distorted representation of space. Somehow you have to tram all those back into

25:12.440 --> 25:17.720
an undistorted representation. So you've got to decode the encoding that's gone on.

25:21.560 --> 25:28.760
I see. Right, so the conscious awareness is still part of the brain somewhere.

25:28.760 --> 25:37.400
But it must come from the brain somewhere, I think. Yes, we all. I see. So you're using encoding and

25:37.400 --> 25:48.280
decoding in a sort of... Distorting, undistorting. It's like a distorting mirror, you've got to

25:48.280 --> 25:55.240
undistort it. But I guess it relates to Karl's distinction between neural substrate and process

25:55.240 --> 26:02.040
theory. Because indeed, if you look at the classical sort of quote-unquote 2D maps in the

26:02.040 --> 26:07.880
cerebral cortex, for instance, the visual cortex with your retinotopy, where you see a lot of

26:08.600 --> 26:13.800
deformation, but also somatosensory cortices, you think about the classical map of the body.

26:15.560 --> 26:21.480
And you are saying, well, if that's the way it is kind of represented quote-unquote at the level of

26:21.480 --> 26:27.320
that substrate, then since it is deformed and we don't experience it that way, we should somehow

26:27.320 --> 26:33.080
have a process on top of that that use some morphism to transform this deformation.

26:33.080 --> 26:39.320
I'm saying our theory of consciousness has to tell us how that unscrambling distortion happens.

26:40.520 --> 26:44.520
Yeah, but I believe that the level of observation that we are considering here,

26:44.520 --> 26:48.360
for instance, those 2D quote-unquote 2D, because they are not really 2D, but

26:49.320 --> 26:57.400
cortical maps, retinotopic or somatotopic or topic maps are a very quote-unquote low level

26:57.400 --> 27:03.880
of processing, which might be very far away from what is going on at the level of the process.

27:03.880 --> 27:07.960
There might be some other super representation somewhere, but we've not found it yet.

27:08.920 --> 27:11.640
Yeah, it might not be visible at the level of the anatomy.

27:13.400 --> 27:17.160
Well, yeah, those are alternatives, I agree.

27:17.880 --> 27:21.240
Okay, so sorry Carl, I interrupted, but I wanted to make this precision too.

27:22.280 --> 27:25.320
Yeah, no, that clarifies it, thank you.

27:27.480 --> 27:32.520
But Carl, I think we can all be agnostic about certain things in the process model.

27:32.520 --> 27:36.040
I think you and I at least are not agnostic about basing into them.

27:38.440 --> 27:40.840
Yeah, I would put the notion of

27:41.160 --> 27:50.920
sentience of the kind we're talking about as a process of basing belief updating.

27:50.920 --> 27:57.240
I put that at the sort of principle level, at the mechanics that doesn't commit to

27:58.920 --> 28:07.720
an infrastructure or a realization or a process that realizes that kind of principle,

28:07.720 --> 28:16.840
that kind of mechanics. So I think the spatial wave theory is really a commitment to a process

28:16.840 --> 28:24.040
theory that could happily accommodate basing belief updating and its particular application,

28:24.040 --> 28:29.560
the context of spatial perception and the projected consciousness model.

28:29.560 --> 28:37.720
You're muted.

28:43.160 --> 28:43.400
Oh, yes.

28:59.560 --> 29:18.200
Okay, so moving on.

29:21.560 --> 29:26.840
So we've done one and two, and what we're going to do in three is add something to the PCM.

29:27.400 --> 29:30.200
And the thing we're going to add is not a little thing.

29:30.200 --> 29:36.760
It's the assumption, the hypothesis that neurons don't do everything, but there is a wave in the

29:36.760 --> 29:40.840
brain which stores 3D spatial information. So that's what I'm going to talk about next.

29:42.360 --> 29:46.200
So here's the hypothesis. There is a wave in the brain that represents 3D space.

29:47.400 --> 29:53.800
So it assumes there is some nearly spherical region of the brain with a diameter D and it

29:53.800 --> 30:00.680
holds waves, which couples the neurons. And there the sphere is illustrated and a couple of waves,

30:00.680 --> 30:05.640
wavelength lambda two, the green wave, and wavelength lambda one, a shorter wavelength,

30:05.640 --> 30:11.800
that red wave. And those waves represent things in space. And they represent the red

30:12.760 --> 30:18.360
thing R1 and the green thing R2. So there's an inverse relationship there. The shorter the

30:18.360 --> 30:23.720
wavelength, the longer the distance to the thing that's being represented. But obviously,

30:23.720 --> 30:29.960
if it's a spherical region, you can have waves in any direction. So you can represent any direction

30:29.960 --> 30:34.440
and any distance up to a maximum, which is defined by the minimum wavelength.

30:35.800 --> 30:41.320
So that wave can represent lots of different things. And the hypothesis is that that wave

30:41.320 --> 30:48.200
acts as a working memory for space. It's really like a hologram. Now, one issue with that is

30:48.200 --> 30:54.360
that if you want to represent objects at very large distances away, then you get into wavelengths

30:54.360 --> 31:01.080
that's too short. So that's why you may need a projective transform of space to pull in those

31:01.080 --> 31:08.600
long distances to be able to represent them on the wave. By the way, the evidence for this wave

31:08.600 --> 31:13.800
is going to be described in another YouTube livestream, which we're making next week,

31:13.800 --> 31:21.720
is going to get that address. So, well, there's a wave based spatial memory form.

31:22.840 --> 31:28.760
It can represent approximately d of a lambda cubed independent positions, which is quite a lot.

31:29.320 --> 31:34.920
And it can give you spatial precision for the order of lambda over d. And the point is that this

31:34.920 --> 31:40.600
can easily be 1% or better, which is the precision you need. So there are significant benefits to

31:40.600 --> 31:46.360
wave storage. It has high capacity. You can put many objects in it. It has a high precision.

31:47.080 --> 31:51.960
It can be fast. And it has low spatial distortion. It is just like a hologram.

31:55.000 --> 32:02.120
And it's a very simple and direct representation of space. So a spoiler looking at part four of

32:02.120 --> 32:08.360
the talk is that this is very much like spatial consciousness. Question is there any evidence

32:08.360 --> 32:14.120
for such a wave? I think there is evidence and there's three kinds of evidence. First two come

32:14.120 --> 32:19.800
from brain anatomy, because there are spherical regions in the brain, which are very well suited

32:19.800 --> 32:25.480
to hold this wave. In the mammals, there is a thalamus, and that's shown in green on the

32:25.480 --> 32:32.520
left of the picture. And you see it's approximately spherical. And that is very suitably connected

32:32.520 --> 32:37.160
for holding spatial information. It's connected to all the sense data, and it's connected to all

32:37.160 --> 32:43.480
the bits of cortex that work out what to do with the sense data. And similarly, in the insect brain,

32:43.480 --> 32:49.320
there is a central body in the very center of it. That is approximately spherical, and it's very

32:49.320 --> 32:57.000
well preserved shape in all insect species. So those are both pieces of evidence for a wave in

32:57.000 --> 33:05.640
the brain. There is a place for it. So I believe there are three lines of evidence for a wave.

33:05.640 --> 33:10.840
One is the computational neuroscience, which I mentioned before, that spatial cognition is a

33:10.840 --> 33:17.480
very important thing, but neural memory for it is too imprecise and too slow. Whereas a wave

33:17.480 --> 33:23.000
storage model can possibly overcome these problems. So that's the yellow evidence, the evidence from

33:23.000 --> 33:29.160
the insect central body that is nearly round, very central, very well connected. And there's evidence

33:29.160 --> 33:35.880
from the mammalian thalamus. It's also round and well connected. But there's also what I call a

33:35.880 --> 33:40.680
smoking gun for a wave in the thalamus that if you don't assume a wave, the anatomy of the

33:40.680 --> 33:46.280
thalamus doesn't make sense. But I won't go into that in this talk. So together, I believe these

33:46.280 --> 33:52.520
give quite strong support for the wave hypothesis. In fact, they give it a probability of 0.5

33:52.520 --> 33:58.600
approximately, even if you try and weight the odds against it. As I say, you can see the

33:58.680 --> 34:03.320
discussion of this in another YouTube live stream we're about to make. So

34:05.000 --> 34:08.680
then that's on from part three to part four of talk.

34:10.840 --> 34:16.440
Assume there is a wave in the brain, which holds the near-projective transform of 3D space. And

34:16.440 --> 34:22.920
this wave is serving a very essential role to understand space to control all movements for

34:22.920 --> 34:28.440
any animal. And the hypothesis simply is the wave is the origin of consciousness.

34:29.320 --> 34:33.800
That neurons have nothing to do with consciousness at all. It comes entirely from the wave.

34:34.520 --> 34:40.440
This solves three problems, the three problems that I outlined before. Firstly, the neural selection

34:40.440 --> 34:45.320
problem, no selection problem, because neurons have nothing to do with consciousness. The precision

34:45.320 --> 34:50.840
and speed problem, the wave has sufficient precision and speed to do it. And the decoding

34:50.840 --> 34:57.560
problem, the coding in the wave is just a Fourier transform. So it's a very simple coding,

34:58.120 --> 35:02.840
encoding, and it's a very simple decoding to give you back conscious experience.

35:02.840 --> 35:09.560
So it has solved those three problems of neural theories. But the main thing is that spatial

35:09.560 --> 35:15.240
like the PCM, preserving the merit of the PCM, the spatial form of consciousness

35:15.880 --> 35:21.880
agrees very well with our conscious experience. It has to be projected because we need the

35:21.880 --> 35:28.120
projection transform to pull in objects from very large distances to represent them by a minimum

35:28.120 --> 35:34.600
wavelength. So in summary, the projective wave theory has a positive Bayesian balance,

35:34.600 --> 35:40.520
doesn't have any Nazis about it, and it agrees very well with the main source of data about consciousness.

35:41.480 --> 35:47.400
So just some aspects of this theory. What is the physical nature of the wave? A big objection

35:47.400 --> 35:53.320
might be we've never seen the wave because I believe it's probably not an electromagnetic

35:53.320 --> 35:59.960
wave or an electromagnetic field. And the main reason I believe that is that electromagnetic

35:59.960 --> 36:04.600
fields on their own don't store information. For the time periods, we need to store information.

36:05.480 --> 36:09.160
And now electromagnetic fields might be part of the answer, but I think they're not the whole

36:10.120 --> 36:15.800
answer. And the big question then is why have we not detected this wave in the brain? It's been

36:15.800 --> 36:22.360
there all these years. I think the reason for that is if there is a wave representing space,

36:22.920 --> 36:28.280
we will expect it to evolve to have very low intensity. So its energy consumption is very

36:28.280 --> 36:33.720
small. And having that low intensity, we simply haven't known how to look for it.

36:34.440 --> 36:40.200
Now, coming to quantum possibilities, the wave might be a coherent quantum

36:40.200 --> 36:46.040
excitation. And there's increasing evidence that quantum effects do have a role in biology.

36:46.760 --> 36:53.800
And it might even be a Bose-Einstein condensate, a BEC. Now those examples of those are superconductors

36:53.800 --> 36:59.640
and superfluids, they're very rash state in nature. But the key thing about a BEC is

36:59.640 --> 37:05.560
a superconductor can hold information for unlimited time. So it would be good for memory.

37:06.200 --> 37:12.920
And they're a very rare and distinctive state of matter. And so if you assume that consciousness

37:12.920 --> 37:19.640
comes from them, you don't get to a trough of panpsychism. Or it might not be a quantum effect,

37:19.640 --> 37:24.680
because I think that this question is entirely open. So we'll set that on one side and that's

37:24.760 --> 37:31.640
future exploration. There is an issue about the evolution of consciousness. We know that

37:31.640 --> 37:36.200
consciousness is, our consciousness is like the real world. It's very like the real world.

37:36.920 --> 37:41.960
And the question is why is this? And you think, well, it must have evolved that way because

37:41.960 --> 37:46.600
some need for it to be like the real world. But in neural theories, there's a problem.

37:47.240 --> 37:53.160
Because neural computation in the brain, the classical neural model, is classical dynamics,

37:53.160 --> 37:59.240
not quantum physics, and is local. And so consciousness is a non physical, non local

37:59.240 --> 38:06.200
effect, and they don't have any effect on neurons firing. So the result is that consciousness in

38:06.200 --> 38:13.000
a neural theory has no causal effect on fitness. That means there's no selection pressure on it

38:13.000 --> 38:18.520
to make it the way it is. So in a neural theory of consciousness, we're driven to this slightly

38:18.520 --> 38:22.920
awkward conclusion that the special form of consciousness that we have is just a bit of

38:22.920 --> 38:28.600
an accident. That seems very unlikely. Whereas in the projective wave theory,

38:28.600 --> 38:33.320
there is a good evolutionary reason for consciousness being like it is. That is that

38:33.320 --> 38:40.200
3D spatial cognition is very important. Wave is an essential part of it. So the wave has been

38:40.200 --> 38:45.240
shaped by evolution. And it's been shaped to be just like the real world, because that's the best

38:45.240 --> 38:51.640
way of controlling. So consciousness then is determined by the wave. And that means consciousness

38:51.640 --> 38:57.080
has evolved to be like that. So the wave theory solves another problem there.

38:58.760 --> 39:04.200
Finally, the unity of consciousness. You may ask this question occasionally, why do I only have

39:04.200 --> 39:09.720
one consciousness and not several parallel consciousnesses? And this also is something

39:09.720 --> 39:14.360
with difficulty neural theories, because we have plenty of neurons in the brain to have many

39:14.360 --> 39:20.600
parallel consciousnesses. And brains can do some things in massive parallelism. And if we had

39:20.600 --> 39:25.640
multiple parallel consciousness, it might be useful, for instance, for parallel planning of

39:25.640 --> 39:32.040
action to see which one works. That's a difficulty for neural theories. The wave theory doesn't

39:32.040 --> 39:36.840
have this difficulty because it accounts for the unity of consciousness. There's only one wave in

39:36.840 --> 39:41.480
the brain. That is the source of consciousness. So there can only be one consciousness.

39:42.120 --> 39:51.560
I think I'm on to the last slide now, pretty much the last slide. If this theory is taken

39:51.560 --> 39:56.040
serious, it makes consciousness into a scientific problem rather than a philosophical problem.

39:56.920 --> 40:02.120
Because a wave in the brain, if a wave in the brain is the key to understanding consciousness,

40:02.120 --> 40:07.480
well, if there's no wave, then this theory is wrong. Get about it. If there is a wave,

40:07.480 --> 40:12.920
I think there are very strong reasons to link it to consciousness, because it has such a good fit

40:12.920 --> 40:18.520
to consciousness. So whether or not the wave exists, that's a scientific question. It's not a

40:18.520 --> 40:23.560
question for philosophy. And I think there's a good prospect of answering it in the next 10 years.

40:23.560 --> 40:28.120
So in 10 years time, either this theory will be the only theory of consciousness,

40:28.120 --> 40:31.480
or it will be wrong and forgotten. I think that's a virtue and a theory.

40:32.120 --> 40:42.200
So finally, last slide on the hard problem, David Chalmers' hard problem. The

40:42.200 --> 40:48.360
predicted wave theory doesn't solve that problem. What I'd say about that is all

40:48.360 --> 40:52.440
science has hard problems. There is the hard problem of consciousness. Why is consciousness

40:52.440 --> 40:58.040
and link to matter? There are hard problems in physics, like what is space-time, or what is the

40:58.040 --> 41:04.600
most fundamental particle? Or the hard problem of cosmology, why is there a universe? So hard

41:04.600 --> 41:11.160
problems just don't have an answer. Scientists will like children keeping asking why, say why this,

41:11.160 --> 41:17.160
why that. And we can go on asking why for as long as we like. So for instance, for fundamental

41:17.160 --> 41:21.720
particles, we thought there was matter, we thought there were atoms, we got to protons,

41:21.720 --> 41:26.760
we got to quarks, and we keep going on and we'll never get the final answer. But we still do science.

41:26.760 --> 41:35.720
So I'm not too worried about the hard problem, consciousness. So that is all, and I've just

41:35.720 --> 41:39.880
laid out a few questions or might want to discuss in the remaining time.

41:42.760 --> 41:46.840
Maybe you could share your slide again so we can see the question if you have them on the slide.

41:48.360 --> 41:53.880
Sorry, is it not sharing now? I see the slide still. Yeah, so you can leave it, maybe check

41:53.880 --> 41:59.320
your view, David. And then you can leave that up and we can have a panel discussion.

42:03.480 --> 42:11.880
Well, thanks a lot. Those who are here can, and Carl and David, please feel free to comment.

42:13.160 --> 42:18.520
And also people will write some questions in the chat and I'll read one in if you pause. But

42:18.520 --> 42:23.320
anyone here who'd like to give a reflection or any comments, that would be awesome.

42:24.840 --> 42:33.960
Could I go ahead? Can you hear me? So if I may, I basically agree with what you say about the

42:33.960 --> 42:38.280
hard problem, just to take the very last thing that you mentioned about the hard problem. And

42:38.280 --> 42:44.760
this is why earlier on when you said that you had kind of a list of sort of, you know,

42:45.400 --> 42:51.240
the idea of the Bayesian balance for theories of consciousness, and you mentioned the existence

42:51.240 --> 42:59.960
of consciousness as itself, something that might be a problem for all neuronal theories of consciousness.

42:59.960 --> 43:05.960
I think you did that on the slide too. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, so I agree. I think it's a problem for any

43:05.960 --> 43:13.240
theory of consciousness, even the kind of more metaphysical theories that people who reflect

43:13.240 --> 43:18.120
like Chalmers and others, panpsychists who reflect on the hard problem a certain way

43:18.680 --> 43:25.480
end up with, you can actually raise the same set of questions for them. So there's really no progress

43:25.480 --> 43:31.240
there, in my opinion. So in other words, if you take the hard problem as a kind of indication

43:31.960 --> 43:39.000
that, well, consciousness couldn't be physical, or, or either that, or the physical world itself

43:39.000 --> 43:44.440
must just be consciousness, which is kind of the two directions they go there. I think that's kind

43:44.520 --> 43:52.920
of misguided. I mean, we, we have to sort of accept that our ability to penetrate, you know,

43:52.920 --> 44:02.200
cognitively, a priori into the nature of the cosmos is, is limited. So our, the best we can do is

44:02.200 --> 44:09.560
make models and, you know, based on the phenomenology and try to arrive at a model that would give us

44:10.440 --> 44:19.960
some kind of neural or physical, to speak more broadly, physical, testable, you know,

44:19.960 --> 44:24.680
hypothesis, hypotheses we can test about the physical world, what we think realizes consciousness.

44:24.680 --> 44:30.760
And it seems to me like that's exactly what you're doing. And that's what I would think is, is right

44:30.760 --> 44:41.480
too. But I did want to ask you, when you say that no neurons are linked to consciousness in your own

44:41.480 --> 44:49.640
model, do you mean, maybe I just don't understand exactly, but they're not linked directly to

44:49.640 --> 44:56.200
consciousness. Okay. But there's some involved in the realization of the wave. Is that Oh,

44:56.200 --> 45:00.920
they are absolutely, they're controlling the wave, they're setting up the wave. They're all

45:00.920 --> 45:06.440
on the cortex, they're using sense data to, to fix the wave. And it's the wave that makes consciousness.

45:07.560 --> 45:16.680
Okay. And on the issue of unity, well, so suppose we identify this type of wave. I mean, it's at

45:16.680 --> 45:23.560
least, you know, conceivable that we would find multiple such waves. Would you can see

45:23.640 --> 45:27.480
well, I think the evidence in the thalamus and the central body is one way.

45:28.680 --> 45:33.000
Okay. And I think one way is what you need to understand one space around you.

45:35.080 --> 45:44.600
Okay. So, but if you found multiple such waves, would you be an issue? Yeah, okay. Well, I mean,

45:44.600 --> 45:50.440
would you conclude that there must be multiple consciousnesses, then in a single brain? Or

45:50.520 --> 45:55.640
would you, would you think that the theory is wrong? No, I would have a selection problem,

45:55.640 --> 46:00.120
just like neuron theories have a selection problem, selecting neurons. I'd have a problem

46:00.120 --> 46:07.560
selecting which wave is conscious. I see. Rather than conclude that there are multiple.

46:09.320 --> 46:13.640
You want to avoid that. My experience is I don't have multiple consciousnesses. Yes.

46:15.960 --> 46:19.720
Right. But that might just be because only one of them gets to report.

46:20.920 --> 46:26.280
Yeah, absolutely. No, like, like the way they, you know, I know it's debatable, but the way they

46:28.440 --> 46:35.480
often interpreted the split brain cases coming out of. Yeah, good question. Good question. I mean,

46:35.480 --> 46:41.560
I say one wave, but we have two thalamus. So the assumption there is that those waves are linked

46:41.560 --> 46:48.920
and perhaps in split brain, they don't get linked. Okay. I think two thalamus have one wave in them,

46:49.160 --> 46:55.400
that's a detail. I see. And then when it comes to the kind of wave, like,

46:56.840 --> 47:03.560
so you don't think it's an electromagnetic wave, you think it might be a Bose-Einstein

47:03.560 --> 47:09.480
condensate. That's a hypothesis, I think, that Karen Smith once flowed. It's been around for some

47:09.480 --> 47:15.880
years. Yeah. Alexander Karen Smith in the book. That's the, yeah, not the book on the origin,

47:15.880 --> 47:21.160
the famous book on the origin of life, but he wrote a book on consciousness back in the 90s,

47:21.160 --> 47:27.240
I think. Yeah, there was Michael Lockwood as well in the 80s, I think. It's a long history.

47:27.880 --> 47:35.080
Okay. So how, when you say that you think we'll be able to probe this within the next 10 years,

47:35.080 --> 47:42.040
I mean, could you sort of sketch how that might go, how we might be able to. Yeah. I mean, just,

47:42.040 --> 47:47.400
this is not, this is probing the idea of the wave. Right. As I say, I think there are those three

47:47.400 --> 47:52.680
pieces of, there's neural models that you can't build decent neural models. There is the thalamus

47:53.320 --> 47:58.200
and there is the insect central body. I think we can go further on each one of those. We can test

47:58.200 --> 48:03.720
them. We can test the thalamus ideas much better using connectome data. We can test the central

48:03.720 --> 48:09.080
body using connectome data. And we can test the computational models by just trying to build them

48:09.080 --> 48:15.960
and see if we get in. So there is science to be done to falsify this hypothesis and it may

48:15.960 --> 48:26.600
succeed in falsifying it. Okay. But how would you measure such condensate? I mean, if you want to

48:26.600 --> 48:32.520
be able to demonstrate the existence of the problem. Ideally, you'd like to actually directly

48:32.600 --> 48:39.560
detect it. I think it's a bit like when Pauli in the 1930s predicted the neutrino. He thought it's

48:39.560 --> 48:44.840
absolutely impossible to detect neutrinos. And it took 25 years to find it. And I think it'll take

48:44.840 --> 48:50.200
a long time to really find this wave in the brain, because it's very low intensity, probably,

48:50.200 --> 48:53.960
and because we just don't know how to look for it. And I think we have to do the biophysics

48:53.960 --> 48:59.400
until we have a convincing case for eyes, this kind of wave, and then we can build a detector.

48:59.400 --> 49:04.840
But until then, I think we won't detect it like neutrino or like dark matter.

49:04.840 --> 49:08.760
Similar thing predicted theoretically years ago, but still not detected.

49:13.800 --> 49:15.640
I'll read a question from the live chat.

49:16.440 --> 49:29.720
Okay. Andrea Val wrote, thanks for sharing such interesting ideas. I wonder how the

49:29.720 --> 49:36.440
PCM or 3D model can explain or deal with the un slash consciousness of emotions.

49:37.880 --> 49:42.600
So where is affectant such in this kind of spatialized model?

49:43.560 --> 49:46.200
Yeah. So maybe you want to join the PCM first, David?

49:48.040 --> 49:56.680
If it's okay, Robert, maybe you have read some recent work on that, but I have a specific

49:57.400 --> 50:00.840
answer to that question. Yeah, you go first.

50:01.560 --> 50:07.720
Yeah, sorry about that. Well, one of the things that we realized working with that

50:07.720 --> 50:14.680
particular geometry is it transform information in the sense of information in space. You can

50:14.680 --> 50:19.080
think about distribution in space, for instance, that are going to be changed by projective

50:19.080 --> 50:25.560
transformation in a manner that affect directly entropy. So if something is very far,

50:26.120 --> 50:29.160
you know, and you have some uncertainty about the localization of these things,

50:29.160 --> 50:34.840
so there is a probability function that represent that uncertainty about the localization

50:34.920 --> 50:40.360
of that thing. And there is only one thing in your field of consciousness to simplify the problem.

50:41.400 --> 50:47.720
Then the entropy of the whole space, if you consider the whole 3D space and some

50:47.720 --> 50:57.240
scalar on it that would represent probabilities is very small. Whereas when you get closer,

50:58.120 --> 51:02.440
for instance, by imagination, the projective transformation that anticipates action,

51:03.160 --> 51:07.800
you get the object closer and you transform also the information, the variance, if you wish,

51:07.800 --> 51:12.840
of your distribution, so it becomes broader. So the entropy increase, actually,

51:12.840 --> 51:17.320
as an effect of projective transformation on the distribution of information.

51:17.320 --> 51:26.520
So how does that relate to emotion? What we realized is that it can account for some

51:26.600 --> 51:32.680
drives that are related to exploration or exploratory behavior or search behavior

51:33.240 --> 51:41.320
to reduce uncertainty or maximize information. And that just does that. So basically,

51:41.320 --> 51:49.480
the projective transformation by in virtue of making probabilities function in space

51:49.720 --> 51:57.960
change their shape as a function of perspective taking, if you wish, until or induce a drive

51:58.600 --> 52:07.080
to approach or avoid things or in this context to approach behavior either through imagination

52:07.080 --> 52:13.400
or through actual behavior because that will maximize information by increasing entropy

52:13.400 --> 52:17.880
of the object and you have more details. So that's something that we wrote a paper that is

52:17.880 --> 52:24.600
currently under review in biological cybernetics about that with Gregor Sergent-Pertu as first

52:24.600 --> 52:31.080
author with a bright mathematician and we can do a demonstration and actually direct theorems about

52:31.080 --> 52:37.240
that and also simulations that show interesting behaviors that depend on projective parameters

52:37.240 --> 52:42.520
that will show that the behavior of the agent, depending on the parameter, will be more focused.

52:42.520 --> 52:47.640
So they will tend to always approach one object because they are driven by this anticipation

52:47.640 --> 52:54.600
of increasing information through projective transformation. But with other parameters or

52:54.600 --> 52:58.760
values of the parameters on the contrary, they start now oscillating between objects.

52:58.760 --> 53:05.400
They start losing focus as if they were kind of ADHD. So there is a deep link between let's say

53:06.760 --> 53:15.080
the evaluation of space, the appraisal of space, the drives that are that unfold from this information

53:15.080 --> 53:22.520
and the behaviors that you have, for instance, approaching and that geometry, that very geometry

53:22.520 --> 53:27.480
we are talking about yield, that type of thing. So here we are talking about what is typically

53:27.480 --> 53:34.200
described as epistemic emotion, basically curiosity. So we have natural curiosity and part of it

53:34.200 --> 53:41.000
that drives behaviors is a result of the very geometry that represents information and appraisal

53:41.000 --> 53:45.800
according to that theory. I cannot enter into the detail on that, but you can also look on

53:46.680 --> 53:54.120
papers that we wrote in what was that 2022 in the Journal of Theoretical Biology in which we use

53:54.120 --> 54:01.400
little robots to demonstrate adaptive and maladaptive behaviors with principles also derived

54:01.400 --> 54:08.680
from the geometry and the free energy principle or something equivalent to get a wealth of

54:09.640 --> 54:17.560
affective behavior of approach avoidance, but also social cognition. We can kind of

54:17.560 --> 54:25.960
simulate social anxiety. We obtain joint attention behavior as a result of mutual perspective taking

54:26.840 --> 54:33.000
and there are a lot of things we could account that we can use in this model and in this framework

54:33.000 --> 54:37.960
to account for emotion. There is a lot of work ahead, but we believe that there is and we have

54:37.960 --> 54:42.920
good reason to believe there is a deep link between space and emotion that's actually called

54:42.920 --> 54:49.560
aesthetics that consciousness is a form of aesthetics where space and emotion are untangled

54:49.560 --> 54:56.440
and that we can fairly well account for many phenomena that relate to emotion and behavior

54:57.080 --> 55:00.200
through this model, but that's sorry for the long talk.

55:01.160 --> 55:07.400
That's great. Shall I give my final answer? It's very much along the same lines that

55:07.960 --> 55:17.560
emotion and space are deeply linked. In the wave model, I mean the model of space contains all

55:17.560 --> 55:23.880
of space, the external space and the internal space of the body and an important part of emotions is

55:24.600 --> 55:28.600
feelings in the body and they are part of your conscious awareness, part of the

55:29.960 --> 55:37.560
wave model or projection model just like the others. Basically, the PW theory and I think the

55:37.560 --> 55:45.480
PCM says all consciousness is spatial. We have qualia, but they exist in space. You hear words,

55:45.480 --> 55:49.800
you experience colors, you experience all of those and you experience feelings,

55:49.800 --> 55:55.400
all of them in space. If you look at all the components of emotion, human emotion for instance,

55:55.400 --> 56:01.320
the words we say to ourselves and the feelings we have in our bodies, they are all represented in

56:02.600 --> 56:09.320
that conscious space. Human emotion is a complex story which perhaps we don't want to go into,

56:09.320 --> 56:13.640
but basically it comes down to the way we experience it is in that model of space.

56:14.280 --> 56:23.560
And if I may, I would have that if you take the standpoint of pure phenomenology and you ask yourself

56:23.560 --> 56:29.080
when I experience an emotion, for instance deep anxiety or fear, something very intense that is

56:29.080 --> 56:35.960
very salient, you can ask yourself how much of that phenomenology of that experience is actually

56:36.520 --> 56:43.240
quote-unquote reducible to some spatial experience. For instance, the experience of the body with the

56:43.240 --> 56:49.080
heart that starts pounding in your chest and you feel it stronger, your lungs that change,

56:49.960 --> 56:54.920
you breathe faster for instance and you can feel that movement in your body and all of that is

56:54.920 --> 56:59.880
spatial. What you feel in your gut or your intestine gets kind of stretched or whatever,

57:00.520 --> 57:06.120
we have metaphors, but actually a lot of the details of the phenomenology of emotion or feelings,

57:06.120 --> 57:13.080
let's say, I believe is actually spatial, but it's overlooked. People don't think about it.

57:13.240 --> 57:18.520
But in particular, about body awareness, there is a lot of spatial stuff going on here.

57:19.400 --> 57:26.680
Yeah, I agree. Mindful meditation, talk a lot about space and talk a lot about the body.

57:26.680 --> 57:29.000
I think they put emotion in the right place.

57:29.000 --> 57:41.560
Carl or Ken, want to add anything or I can look for another question in the live chat.

57:49.080 --> 57:57.640
Well, I have one question. So I mean, your current hypothesis is that this wave is

57:57.640 --> 58:04.600
realized in the thalamus. Is that right? That's right. Yeah. Okay. So that's sort of

58:07.240 --> 58:12.520
would, you know, there's this kind of debate about whether or not consciousness is cortical

58:13.640 --> 58:19.800
or subcortical. So this would definitely be on the subcortical side. I think there's a lot of

58:19.800 --> 58:24.040
sense in the global workspace theory and they were talking originally about a workspace involving

58:24.040 --> 58:29.880
the thalamus and the cortex. I think it's the consciousness really comes from the thalamus

58:29.880 --> 58:38.040
integrating all that spatial information. So it is down. So the follow up, but yeah, that's fine

58:38.040 --> 58:44.040
with me, frankly. But the follow up question is, well, it's not exactly a follow up to that. It's

58:44.040 --> 58:50.600
more a general question about your way of thinking about it. How, I mean, I know maybe you can't

58:50.600 --> 58:56.680
really answer this until we have a more specific hypothesis about exactly what kind of wave it is,

58:56.680 --> 59:05.640
but could you say something generally about how the wave integrates with or what's the right way

59:05.640 --> 59:13.320
to put it, use it, recruits and, you know, the kind of computational apparatus of the brain

59:13.320 --> 59:19.640
so that, you know, you end up, you decide to, oh, I'm going to reach out, you know,

59:19.640 --> 59:28.200
yay far and grab this bottle. How does the, how does, you know, computationally speaking,

59:28.200 --> 59:34.120
how does the wave integrate? Yeah, I think that's a very good question and could have a very long

59:34.120 --> 59:41.320
answer. But basically, the wave integrates information from all the sense data. So from

59:41.320 --> 59:47.480
your hands, from your ears, from your eyes, all that information goes through the cortex and cortex

59:47.480 --> 59:54.440
decides where it's coming from and broadcast signals back to the thalamus and the thalamus wave

59:54.440 --> 59:59.320
integrates all those signals together to produce the Bayesian best model of what's happening at

59:59.320 --> 01:00:07.000
this moment based on touch, proprioception, hearing, sound, hearing, vision and so on. So the

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:13.800
computation, it's an integration of many sorts of information, possibly in a cycle between the

01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:24.760
thalamus and the cortex. Okay, but if you need to, you know, for example, program and action,

01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:31.320
so you've, that's kind of the, you got your sensory, the integration of all your sensory

01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:36.920
information, now you need to program and action. How do, and maybe this is just my ignorance,

01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:45.000
how do waves, how can waves be used in a way to generate programming of an action and then give

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:50.600
it back to your neurons? I mean, I've only got beginnings of answers to that. But basically,

01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:56.120
wave is very good for representing 3D geometry and for calculating displacements. I know where

01:00:56.120 --> 01:01:01.240
my hand is, I know where my coffee cup is, so the wave helps me calculate the displacement,

01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:05.960
which way I have to move my hand to pick up the coffee cup. So it's that kind of spatial

01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:09.560
calculation that the wave is always helping us do, just to move our limbs.

01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:19.400
I have a follow-up question on that, if I may. Ken, do you mind?

01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:20.920
Yeah, no, go ahead, go ahead.

01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:27.640
You invoked earlier Fourier transform and inverse Fourier transform, so at least 3D Fourier transform

01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:32.920
and inverse Fourier transform, in order to do the encoding and decoding to, you know,

01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:39.720
go move from the wave to the neural substrates back and forth. Of course, as you know,

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:49.400
there is a limit in resolution. When you do a Fourier transform, you have the uncertainty

01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:57.640
principle that rules the initial resolution that we can have. Of course, it depends on the

01:01:57.640 --> 01:02:03.080
number of samples. I mean, there are a lot of arithmetics behind it. It can be more and more

01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:12.680
precise as you have more and more bits of encoding, if you wish. So you said that classical

01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:21.960
neural theories like build upon substrates that lack enough precision in spatial resolution,

01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:28.200
for instance, to account for our experience. Would you think that in the context of a wave theory,

01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:35.000
the type of uncertainty principle that are attached to it, could cause a problem of resolution too,

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:40.920
or that it's the granularity? There is a problem, yeah. There is a problem of resolution.

01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:45.560
I alluded to it in the slides. That is that if you've got a minimum wavelength lambda

01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:51.960
and a diameter of the sphere D, the maximum precision is lambda over D, and that can't

01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:58.040
be infinite precision. So that's the uncertainty principle. But the idea of the Fourier transform

01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:03.960
is not that something in the brain does a Fourier transform. It is the fundamental bridging law for

01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:09.720
consciousness does the Fourier transform. It says that consciousness is a Fourier transform of the

01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:17.400
wave, full stop. Fourier transform is there in fundamental laws of nature, like quantum mechanics,

01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:22.440
for instance. So it's saying this is a fundamental law of nature, just like quantum mechanics says

01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:29.880
momentum is a Fourier transform position. So the bridging law for consciousness says

01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:33.800
the form of consciousness is a Fourier transform of the wave.

01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:43.960
I'll make a short comment, or Carl, do you want to?

01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:55.320
After you. Okay. So thank you for the presentation, and it's really interesting on many levels.

01:03:55.320 --> 01:04:01.160
First, you and the paper goes into more detail on this. You lay out what your priors are,

01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:07.640
and kind of the dependency structure to actually reach at least an estimate of probabilities,

01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:11.480
which is it's really interesting. It gives a lot of opportunities for people to dig in

01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:16.200
and say, yeah, I think that's 10% likely or no, it's a zero. This is not possible and kind of

01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:24.280
close off a branch of inquiry. And also this discussion here about the algorithmic and the

01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:31.400
substrate realization interaction with the substrate, and even this poly computation idea of

01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:36.520
the observer's model of what's happening in a process, and kind of like the dark matter there,

01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:41.400
like the observer might suggest that there's a cryptographic process, though they couldn't

01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:46.840
decode it. And then that would have an entropy distribution that wouldn't be distinguishable

01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:53.000
in the absence of the decryption from a noise, but it would be like still a hypothesis kept alive.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:59.560
And you could say, I think it's a 1% chance of this being the case. One thought is how

01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:08.120
high precision really is the spatial generative model in that there could be visual upscaling?

01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:14.840
We know there's attention play to make the periphery look sharp and have color vision.

01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:21.320
And so it's possible that especially for like distant objects, small objects that they could be

01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:29.560
bundled and just seen as a assembly, as a larger object, if they're touching like the car body

01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:37.800
and the wheel, and then the same way that in the periphery, color and visual attention seem to give

01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:44.120
this extreme like, wow, that's like exactly this angle. If you were to go over there with a protractor,

01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:49.560
but that could be as we're sort of seeing with diffusion and generative AI models,

01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:59.240
that could be quite a low resolution structural inference followed by a just compatible visual

01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:08.360
realization. And then just last comment, really interesting to explore, how does evolution

01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:15.320
and intergenerational change shape the substrate that the sense data wash over so that non-stationary

01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:21.000
stable states, whether they're rate encoding of neuron, whether glial, electro,

01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:27.480
and all these other even potentially more exotic options, how are those stabilized?

01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:36.520
Wow. I mean, those are real questions to investigate, particularly the precision of our

01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:42.680
conscious experience and how much is quotes and illusion. But I personally think that if you look

01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:47.720
at something which is a straight line, you experience it as a straight line with some kind

01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:54.920
of precision that's of the order of 1%, a deviation of 1% from a straight line would show. And so

01:06:54.920 --> 01:07:03.160
that's a lower bound on the precision of your model. But again, there can be lots of discussion

01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:14.200
about this. Yeah, interesting. Karl, any thoughts?

01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:26.200
Well, just a few sort of practical and specific questions. So the nature of this wave, if I wanted

01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:31.160
to model it, I mean, are we talking about a standing wave? Are we talking about a soliton?

01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:37.800
Are we talking about spherical harmonics on the surface of the thalamus? Are we talking about

01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:47.160
what kind of basis might I use for this kind of wave, even before asking questions about what

01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:52.440
the wave amplitude actually means? So what's the functional mathematical form of this way?

01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:59.560
Very good questions, whether it's a standing wave or a moving wave. I don't know. The nice

01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:07.720
thing about a Bose-Einstein condensate is that it acts like a long-lived quantum mechanical

01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:15.560
wave function. In other words, it has phase which can be detected, and it preserves phase for long

01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:21.960
times. And the wave might have to preserve phase in order to represent positions. If you have a

01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:27.720
standing wave like cos theta in some direction in this sphere, then there's an ambiguity. It

01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:33.320
represents plus a direction and the minus direction and what happens to the minus direction. So

01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:38.840
I would rather have phase in the wave like a Bose-Einstein condensate, but they're very

01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:43.400
deep questions and I don't do the answers. I mean, we could start modelling and see what happens.

01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:52.520
Just propose some answers. Basically, you just need a spherical volume that holds a wave

01:08:52.520 --> 01:09:00.120
excitation with a certain maximum wave vector, and we could try out standing waves, moving waves,

01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:13.400
and so on. What would differentiate a condensate from a formulation in terms of a time-dependent

01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:22.200
floating wave equation? Well, I think your time-dependent floating wave, as everybody knows,

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:28.360
the problem with quantum in the brain is that decoherence smashes it in 10 to the minus 20 seconds,

01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:33.640
but that doesn't happen to a Bose-Einstein condensate. A Bose-Einstein condensate is a long-lived quantum

01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:41.960
state, and so that's an ordinary floating equation. Decoherence is going to smash you in no time at

01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:46.600
all unless you have some incredibly clever insulation like in a quantum computer.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:55.960
Right. I mean, lifting from the microscopic to the macroscopic, I mean, that would suggest

01:09:55.960 --> 01:10:02.680
that you need very, very low temperatures thermodynamically speaking. No one has observed

01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:08.760
a BC at room temperature yet, but we've got close, and the idea is that nature might be cleverer than

01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:18.600
we are. One angle, perhaps from the quantum FEP from Carl and Chris Fields and others is,

01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:26.760
and what I heard in the basis set question, Carl, was this brain region that hosts the

01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:35.000
functionality or the core aspect of the functionality, like one option is it is like the wave is

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:42.040
represented inside of that sphere. Like just, there's probably multiple ways even that could

01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:47.720
happen, but it's like a little reconstruction wave, but symbolized. Another option would be,

01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:54.760
like a holograph, the representation space is encoded on the interface of that region with

01:10:54.760 --> 01:11:04.040
other regions, and so that kind of surface is maintained and stabilized and has information

01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:09.960
flowing through it. And then there wouldn't necessarily be something in the middle, but it'd

01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:17.160
be more like a ripple on a surface, which was the basis set question. Daniel, that is very

01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:23.480
interesting because in the thalamus, there is the thalamic reticular nucleus, TRN, which is a thin

01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:29.160
skin around the surface of the thalamus. And you could just say that is holding the surface wave.

01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:33.880
And the wave is projected inside from the surface.

01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:46.440
It would be useful to engage Chris Fields here. There are two very distinct uses of the word

01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:54.120
holographic here. You could be referring to the holographic principle, whereby all the information

01:11:54.120 --> 01:12:02.920
on the bulk, on the inside, say, of the thalamus was on the surface, on the reticular nucleus

01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:11.640
of the thalamus, for example, or just on the surface in one sense. And that is what the rest

01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:19.800
of the brain sees and possibly consciousness sees. But that's a very different use of the notion of

01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:27.880
a holographic projection using constructive and destructive interference to encode things.

01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:35.480
So Daniel, you're absolutely right. My question was really searching to distinguish,

01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:43.320
are we talking about a wave function in the thalamus? Are we talking about

01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:51.640
application of the holographic principle to the classical information on the surface

01:12:52.760 --> 01:13:00.680
of some bulk that was the thalamus? And you could then argue, if you wanted to, that the bulk,

01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:04.920
which can never be observed from the outside, unless you are the thalamus, you never know what's

01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:12.920
happening on the inside. You could only observe what's on the surface. That would be a different

01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:21.960
notion of a wave theory that would certainly be consistent with quantum information theory

01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:29.480
and also consistent with Chris Fields in a screen hypothesis that could be

01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:39.080
spatialized and endowed with, in virtue of the fact that on the holographic screen itself,

01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:45.160
on the surface, there can only be classical information and that information can now be

01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:54.440
cast in terms of classical Bayesian inference. But it also relates to, I repeat to Chris Fields,

01:13:54.440 --> 01:14:01.960
in a screen hypothesis, which is, if you like, taking quantum information,

01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:09.240
theoretic principles and trying to apply them to consciousness, that eludes the problem of

01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:20.760
applying quantum mechanics that is only relevant at the very small scale, for very precise or

01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:30.280
low temperature systems. If you want to apply that kind of maths to macroscopic phenomena,

01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:35.160
then you have to apply it in a scale invariant context and I think quantum information theory

01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:39.320
would certainly do that. So, Daniel, yes, I was exactly trying to probe.

01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:56.520
Is PW red? The Bose-Einstein condensate variant or alternative version of the projective wave

01:14:57.480 --> 01:15:10.920
is that committed to quantum mechanics or is it really an expression of condensate-like dynamics

01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:18.120
in the context of quantum information theory? And if it is, does it live on a holographic screen

01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:23.240
or does it live in the bulk? And if it lives in the bulk, what are these wave functions over?

01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:26.360
So, these are the practical questions I was trying to get out.

01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:33.240
Very interesting questions and it's all to play for. I have an open mind about them, but

01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:40.760
my feeling is that the BEC is a way of getting past this decoherence argument from

01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:51.960
Tickmark others that neurons have to be classical. And the BEC, it does work very well as a memory.

01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:57.640
That's the practical point of it. Working memory, I think, is what you need for space.

01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:08.600
Awesome. Perhaps each can give a last round of thought. Where do they feel this takes them

01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:15.880
or what are they looking forward to and can then David and then Carl and then Robert?

01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:24.200
Yeah, I don't have anything new to add. I find this really interesting and I remember

01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:32.360
reading Karen Smith's book kind of arguing that Bose-Einstein condensates might be

01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:39.480
important for understanding consciousness and thinking that among the quantum mechanical

01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:50.280
hypotheses, I like that one the best. I said earlier, I just sort of have this kind of bias,

01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:59.000
but I'm totally willing to be talked out of it. I don't want to go into the details, but

01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:07.560
I think Karen Smith's concern was about the unity of consciousness primarily and also kind of made

01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:17.960
the case that as you were suggesting that maybe as you put it, nature is cleverer than we are

01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:24.920
and there's some way to realize that Bose-Einstein condenses it in the brain without the decoherence

01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:34.280
issue. But anyway, just to say this is all very, very fascinating to me and I am happy to continue

01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:46.120
the discussion next week, right? Isn't it next week? Thank you, Ken. And from my part, yes,

01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:54.040
I'm also looking forward to continuations of the discussion. My direction of questioning

01:17:54.040 --> 01:18:00.120
will be something on the lines that I think both Karen and David alluded to which is the

01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:11.880
the link between spatial waves in the brain and the projective geometry that they speak to

01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:19.480
and the information geometry that underwrites belief updating and the Bayesian mechanics that

01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:26.120
inherit from the free energy principle, being it classical mechanics, the classical information

01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:37.080
processing or looking at using quantum information theory to read belief updating.

01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:42.520
I'm not sure I'm going to get any answers, but that's what I'm interested in hearing more about

01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:46.200
and the process. If you haven't talked about mortal computation yet, so we need to talk about

01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:54.360
mortal computation. Oh, yes. David, any last thoughts? Well, the thought of a

01:18:56.360 --> 01:19:02.680
of a man who is 15 now and feels that the more he learns, the less he knows. So it was predicted

01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:10.920
in all the books I had read in my years. And so I'm whole opened to that complex universe. I certainly

01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:18.040
believe that nature is clever than I am for sure. And I find that fascinating. I like the rationale.

01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:22.520
It's not like, you know, there is a lot of stuff about quantum mechanics and the brain

01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:27.240
and consciousness that to me has always sounded wishy-washy, if not completely wacko.

01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:36.120
But I came back a bit from that. I had a lot of like Ken priors, negative priors about it.

01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:43.080
I remember once in Tucson, Arizona, at the famous conference about the science of consciousness,

01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:47.400
there were this bunch of guys who called themselves, they were German, the quantum

01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:51.880
consciousness Academy, and they were all dressed in black and they are all, you know, headset and

01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:57.480
microphone like that. And they were like speaking nonsense as like a cult. But I found that very

01:19:57.480 --> 01:20:03.400
fascinated because I used to like very fascinating. So I used to like this conference back in the day

01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:08.680
when it was very psychedelic. But that was kind of, you know, and I come back to that because

01:20:08.680 --> 01:20:15.720
my ignorance, I'm becoming aware more and more of my own ignorance. I say, well, why not? And

01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:21.480
definitely I think that maybe Carl can try to do that. If we could get Chris Field in the next

01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:27.400
core role, he would certainly be among us, the most competent. I tried to get Grégoire Sergent

01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:33.960
to the core, but he was not available. He's a very bright mathematician and he master quantum

01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:39.960
mechanics like, like if it was, you know, I don't know, it's nothing for him. Or Daniel Benka would

01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:44.520
be the best also is Grégoire. But I'm afraid I won't be able to have them here. But I think it

01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:49.320
would be very useful to have some people like that who definitely know more than me about those

01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:54.840
things. And Chris might be interested to join. I don't know, Carl. But looking forward to the next

01:20:55.400 --> 01:21:02.920
to the next discussion, one correction, they were Swiss, David, they weren't, they weren't, they

01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:11.880
weren't, they were Swiss, they were Swiss black, I think. Yes, they kind of look like people from

01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:17.800
the matrix. They were Swiss. They were not German. They were Swiss. And they had, they had a leader

01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:21.720
they were always in contact with. Super hot.

01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:31.240
Wow. Okay. Yeah, please, Robert, and, and, and we'll contact Chris.

01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:41.320
That's been really fascinating. I think the virtue of this theory is that it is falsifiable.

01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:47.480
In other words, if there's no way in the brain, forget it, this theory is wrong. And that's exactly

01:21:47.480 --> 01:21:52.840
the question we're going to be looking at next week. I look forward to having your contributions.

01:21:54.840 --> 01:22:07.400
Awesome. Thank you all. See you at 16 UTC on July 29th. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Bye.
