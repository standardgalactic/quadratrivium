00:00.000 --> 00:14.640
Hello and welcome. It is September 12, 2023. We're here in the Active Inference for the

00:14.640 --> 00:20.480
Social Sciences course at the Active Inference Institute and having a discussion section

00:20.480 --> 00:28.560
on semiotics and semantics here with Lorena Saganzula. We're going to be having a fun discussion,

00:28.560 --> 00:33.920
I hope. If you're watching live, please feel free to write any questions in the live chat.

00:34.640 --> 00:40.240
If you thought about joining and you weren't sure, it's not too late. Otherwise, we're going to

00:40.240 --> 00:48.480
pick up on some key points from the lecture and on the topic and see where we go. So, Lorena,

00:49.440 --> 00:55.680
welcome back and however you want to begin, let's go from there.

00:57.360 --> 01:09.600
Okay. Hello. Thank you, Daniel. So, let's try to recap a little bit where we left off during the

01:09.600 --> 01:22.000
lecture just to remind us where we were. My point, what I was trying to articulate was the idea of

01:24.000 --> 01:28.960
what does it mean to talk about formal semantics in a way that is not really

01:29.840 --> 01:40.640
loaded because it's an interesting thought to have a semantics that is actually only formal.

01:41.360 --> 01:51.920
In principle, it would be relative to meaning. In the notion that

01:52.880 --> 02:08.320
active inference is trying to cash it out. It's more like an idea or a way of modeling how

02:09.840 --> 02:19.760
how we deal with meaningful situations. And she understands that in a more interesting,

02:19.760 --> 02:27.680
more embodied and more concrete way, I was suggesting that we could use bio-semiotics as

02:34.800 --> 02:46.000
as a model and as a theory for leaving creatures like language users to navigate the realm of symbols.

02:46.240 --> 02:59.360
And gave one example which came from James Koch, which is the European forest

02:59.360 --> 03:05.520
trade that comes with a practice. Understanding this scientific understanding of forests as a

03:05.520 --> 03:18.000
practice that allows us to refer to meaningful things in the environment in terms of what is

03:18.000 --> 03:28.800
valuable, what's interesting and what is not. And interestingly, what is more important also

03:28.800 --> 03:39.760
from what becomes valuable, it is what is cropped out from the meaningful perspective. So things

03:40.480 --> 03:48.240
nature, parts of nature becomes left out or understood as something that is not desirable.

03:48.240 --> 03:57.520
And you just understand what you don't want in your articulating principle as weeds or

03:57.520 --> 04:06.880
something that you should get rid of in respect to what is more desirable in terms of crops and

04:06.880 --> 04:13.440
how you understand nature in a more commoditized way.

04:13.920 --> 04:26.160
And I find like this example from Scott kind of very, very elucidating.

04:30.160 --> 04:36.640
In the book he creates this, in the book he's talking about states, how we articulate

04:37.360 --> 04:44.080
life around one specific notion of state. But in this specific example he has

04:44.960 --> 04:51.280
the idea of one official observer and this official observer establishes a principle of

04:52.160 --> 05:00.880
meaning in a way you have to have a handle of nature and that also articulates how

05:01.120 --> 05:11.120
villages and how practices around agriculture and how people relate to each other within these

05:11.120 --> 05:24.560
practices gets organized. Specifically for one interesting point that he makes that is to appreciate

05:24.720 --> 05:31.920
to appreciate the constriction of that is like a vision that notices not

05:31.920 --> 05:37.920
what within the meaningful crops but which is left outside the field of vision.

05:41.200 --> 05:45.440
And I bring that specifically to understand how

05:46.400 --> 05:55.440
the free-knit principle can or could be connected to a generalized synchronization

05:56.480 --> 06:03.200
over time in relation to those symbols and those practices in terms of niche construction and

06:05.840 --> 06:12.880
how those, how this niche construction brings along with the symbolic

06:13.840 --> 06:18.640
use of our language, our predictive value.

06:26.480 --> 06:31.200
Thank you. Bryn, do you want to bring up any thoughts on that or any other

06:32.320 --> 06:34.320
pieces or I'm happy to add a comment.

06:42.960 --> 07:02.560
Okay, guess not. A lot to say there. There was a little bit of a double play with what is cropped.

07:02.560 --> 07:14.560
On one hand what is cropped is the industrial crop that is being prepared and then the other

07:14.560 --> 07:20.640
side of that coin is what is cropped out and what we crop in is the part that we're paying

07:20.640 --> 07:27.440
attention to and we can't pay attention to everything so it's like two sides of the same coin

07:27.440 --> 07:33.120
what we pay attention to what we include in attention in our cognitive awareness

07:33.920 --> 07:42.240
leaves the shadow which is what we exclude and that could be like the weeds or the other ecosystem

07:42.240 --> 07:49.200
services so by highlighting the meaning or one dimension of meaning or one stance on meaning

07:49.520 --> 07:56.880
that only it's like a seesaw that becomes salient to the extent that something else

07:57.840 --> 08:03.760
must be deprioritized so that's how we accentuate these distributions of meaning

08:04.560 --> 08:10.800
and what do we get from active inference and and free energy principle beyond for example

08:10.800 --> 08:16.400
what's provided and seeing like a state. I think there's a lot we could say on that but

08:17.120 --> 08:26.560
one piece is we get a process theory a real procedural approach to how different systems

08:27.200 --> 08:34.160
come to do sense making and cognition and action so just describing the lay of the land

08:34.720 --> 08:42.880
or the history of forestry in Europe or any other state of affairs in the world

08:43.120 --> 08:48.080
merely describing it may not even help us determine what's going to happen

08:48.800 --> 08:55.120
a short time later let alone a long time later or what might happen in a very different ecology

08:55.840 --> 09:01.520
whereas if we understand the processes of sense making and decision making that different kinds

09:01.520 --> 09:07.840
of cognitive agents do certainly humans also those states as cognitive entities which is

09:07.840 --> 09:13.840
what seeing like a state or thinking like a state entails we get a process-based view

09:14.880 --> 09:21.520
on what otherwise might be merely descriptive and along with that process-based view we gain

09:21.520 --> 09:27.680
an increased ability to make unique explanations predictions accounts and so on.

09:28.320 --> 09:41.680
Yeah we can we can also understand it in a different perspective in terms of

09:42.240 --> 09:48.800
realizing what becomes sensitized and what becomes desensitized

09:50.080 --> 09:56.880
along the process so you can you can possibly model that using this kind of tools and understanding

09:56.880 --> 10:02.720
how that happens over time right I don't know how how much in terms of prediction

10:03.920 --> 10:10.080
of things that we're not foreseeing in these descriptions we can we can achieve in fact

10:10.960 --> 10:17.840
you can achieve some some level for sure but like that system should be this side how

10:19.120 --> 10:25.120
how that delivers a very all-encompassing prediction in this kind in these cases they

10:25.120 --> 10:35.920
don't believe it can right I don't think that's the purpose as well but we can at least have

10:37.280 --> 10:43.360
which is might not be as positive as we want but I think we can understand how

10:45.440 --> 10:51.200
we can gain some understanding in this process of being more sensitive or less sensitive to specific

10:51.680 --> 11:02.160
primes and how this organizational principles how powerful they become over time

11:06.080 --> 11:12.320
yeah I'll read some comments in the chat and then Lorena or Brent feel free to just give

11:12.320 --> 11:20.640
any thoughts just upcycle club wrote hello biomimicry can enhance biosemiotics by showing

11:20.640 --> 11:27.200
us how nature solves problems and creates beauty through signs and codes and by encouraging us

11:27.200 --> 11:38.000
to apply these principles to our own creations yeah the idea of coding is an interesting idea

11:38.000 --> 11:45.440
but to talk about codes I don't think we can that's my take right I don't understand

11:45.440 --> 11:55.120
like you have we haven't coded any type of principles within our cognitive ability but

11:57.680 --> 12:04.960
biologically speaking however you can understand these encodings in terms of becoming more or less

12:05.040 --> 12:14.560
sensitive over time to environmental cues as the example in terms of I use the example of

12:14.560 --> 12:26.240
forestry right so in that specific case this what becomes more what you become more sensitive and

12:26.240 --> 12:32.080
the more you organize your life or the social life is organized around specific principles

12:32.080 --> 12:42.000
then you can make sense of these relational stories instead of just leveraging one full

12:45.520 --> 12:52.960
difficult to explain notion of encoding in terms of social cognition because it will be hard to

12:52.960 --> 12:59.920
explain how the brain will be encoding these specific symbols but they can be cashed out

13:00.000 --> 13:04.800
in the environment relationally in terms of those organizational principles

13:06.560 --> 13:14.800
and then you have this idea of biomimicry like this reiterations and how that comes along with

13:18.160 --> 13:21.600
to explain what this mimic or this mean will be then

13:22.560 --> 13:25.440
of it's not so so straightforward they think

13:27.760 --> 13:35.520
well certainly decompiling the source code of nature is somewhere between challenging and

13:35.520 --> 13:43.680
misguided or impossible but that notion of a code script for biology has animated discussions of

13:43.680 --> 13:49.440
life going back to for example Schrodinger's what is life he basically says there's two

13:49.440 --> 13:56.800
aspects of living systems there's their organizational capacity their negentropic capacity

13:57.360 --> 14:04.800
and then there's their code script their aperiodic crystalline informational repository

14:05.360 --> 14:13.360
and then another place that coding comes up a little bit less in the source code space is

14:13.360 --> 14:20.880
predictive coding and that's in a way highly compatible with active inference and gives a

14:20.880 --> 14:27.520
deflationary account on how the semiotics are encoded rather than saying well this is what this

14:27.520 --> 14:33.680
variable in the source code means or this is what this codes for or here's a code switch

14:34.560 --> 14:41.600
predictive coding is like saying we're not even going to touch the semantics of what the sign is

14:41.600 --> 14:49.040
itself we're just going to hypothesize that the way that information about the sign is transferred

14:49.760 --> 14:56.400
is through this maximum information signaling approach called predictive coding because predictive

14:56.400 --> 15:05.040
coding arose out of video compression algorithms and only at the end of the 90s was found to be

15:05.040 --> 15:11.360
increasingly relevant for neural circuitry and so on so it's another example of where like a process

15:11.360 --> 15:27.840
based approach ends up deflating or reframing the otherwise semantically loaded question

15:29.440 --> 15:33.920
it's like switching out the question of like where we're going to be with how we're going to get there

15:34.880 --> 15:39.520
and instead of only focusing on the meaning of the signs first off as if the meaning of the

15:39.520 --> 15:45.600
signs could be discussed outside of their implementation and then even if we could figure

15:45.600 --> 15:50.720
out what the signs were we would then just turn around and want to know how they were transmitted

15:51.520 --> 15:57.120
and so predictive coding or predictive processing in a way short circuits that or

15:57.120 --> 16:04.720
inverse it by first looking to explain how information is transmitted that could support

16:05.680 --> 16:12.560
semiotics and then in the context of biological systems we naturally have biosemiotics

16:16.640 --> 16:22.640
yeah i would ask the question when you talk about information being transmitted right what that

16:22.640 --> 16:28.160
actually means and i think that's a very very big topic and a very large discussion in terms of

16:28.960 --> 16:39.120
uh information information theory when specifically applying that into biological systems i think

16:39.120 --> 16:44.480
there are some interesting people working on information that makes the case that Shannon has

16:44.480 --> 16:52.160
a point and he's really interested not in the semantics or in the meaning or anything else it's

16:52.240 --> 16:57.040
kind of interested in the problem of transmission and when you talk about transmission

16:59.040 --> 17:06.800
it's worth to ask what is being transmitted exactly in the terms of of signals even if you're

17:06.800 --> 17:12.560
capturing specific patterns and you think that the pattern is this thing that will be transmitted

17:13.200 --> 17:16.080
in that sense but that would be a worth

17:19.920 --> 17:28.240
a worth asking question to understand like the this notion of what is actually being

17:28.800 --> 17:34.240
transmitted in that sense like the information probably this information theory is focusing

17:34.240 --> 17:40.080
on this notion of the problem of transmission and then all the the concepts that come along to

17:40.080 --> 17:47.840
explain that in terms of uncertainty or noise and everything that uh impacts this transmission

17:47.840 --> 17:57.600
of processes and if you're saying like we're transmitting information in these things that

17:57.600 --> 18:05.840
is breaking this semantic code apart yes it is because like the problem is not focused on that

18:05.840 --> 18:13.520
it's that focusing on the specific correlations that we have that we call it we're mentioning

18:13.520 --> 18:21.840
as information and how these correlations are an issue from from the cat go from what is being

18:21.840 --> 18:28.880
picked up in one side being correlated to what comes into the other side right how that how do

18:28.880 --> 18:37.440
you lose or gain more information in that but the deeper question here is

18:40.160 --> 18:45.360
how can you say that you are actually gaining or losing that information because you are defining

18:45.360 --> 18:51.120
this correlation that could be transmitted or not from the cat go if you don't have that

18:52.080 --> 18:55.680
you don't have anything being actually actually communicated

18:58.080 --> 19:04.960
so with that in mind you can explain these concepts in terms of function and then there's

19:04.960 --> 19:16.080
a bunch of theories that navigate this sense of uh signaling that is specifically only functional

19:16.160 --> 19:18.320
and then predictive coding tries to

19:22.080 --> 19:29.200
try tries to push that a little further maybe but then you have to explain in

19:31.120 --> 19:35.840
in a deep sense how this information is being actually transmitted and processed and I don't

19:35.840 --> 19:40.400
think that is really really as obvious and as clear as we think it is

19:41.040 --> 19:47.360
specifically when we're talking about this biological

19:48.880 --> 19:53.280
way of nature navigating this process this this signaling

19:55.520 --> 20:01.600
we have to talk about because the correlation if it's defined are being issued like from the

20:01.600 --> 20:08.480
beginning you can only have this kind of transmission for someone specific that can

20:08.480 --> 20:11.520
be able to understand that in the other side right

20:15.520 --> 20:23.200
well certainly whether we're talking about a chemical pheromone that requires some type

20:23.200 --> 20:31.280
of receptor or something more ephemeral like language that requires more of a semantic reference

20:31.360 --> 20:39.120
frame there's no receiving the message without the sender it's like they're kind of the two

20:39.120 --> 20:48.720
sides of the phone call um I'll ask a question from the chat love evolve how about cultural

20:48.720 --> 20:56.240
encoding and principles in contrast to organizational so how do we think about

20:56.240 --> 21:05.760
cultural meaning and is and is that similar or different than organizational

21:08.560 --> 21:14.320
yeah that's that's a good point right I think if you take very seriously the example from

21:15.760 --> 21:25.440
the forestry is a practice then I think it has to be organizational in that sense the meaning

21:26.320 --> 21:32.960
navigates this organizational practice this organizational story that

21:35.040 --> 21:43.440
that impacts not only communication between agents but also how

21:45.520 --> 21:52.960
how the environment will be interpreted so and in this sense it will be transmitted

21:52.960 --> 21:58.240
and repeated over time because it has a history you cannot ignore like the history of this

21:58.800 --> 22:05.040
practices being pushed further and replicated through generations right so

22:10.240 --> 22:12.080
the way like the villages will be

22:14.480 --> 22:19.840
organized in terms of that specific practice for instance can be understood in a meaningful

22:19.840 --> 22:26.320
and cultural way that organizes life in virtue of

22:29.040 --> 22:38.000
some specific principles that sensitizes our agents towards specific directions

22:40.640 --> 22:41.120
and I think

22:50.800 --> 22:58.960
I don't I don't forget my point for instance you can talk about

23:05.440 --> 23:12.320
if you think about archaeological findings and how archaeological

23:13.040 --> 23:20.720
so descriptions of specific villages and how they navigate this mapping out this

23:23.120 --> 23:32.400
this archaeological sites they usually know exactly if you have some kind of history already

23:32.400 --> 23:38.160
from this this communities how this how that city will be likely to be organized

23:38.880 --> 23:44.720
first off like where is the water and if the water is in certain directions probably

23:45.600 --> 23:52.400
there will be certain kinds of relationships with housing and communal housings and where

23:52.400 --> 23:59.200
are they going to place their dead in relation to this kind of specific organization principle

23:59.200 --> 24:06.800
the water is here so plantations will be not so far away from that and this city organizes

24:06.880 --> 24:13.440
like the village organized a little bit in this sense and that builds up cultural practices

24:14.160 --> 24:16.880
at least archaeologically can be explained as such

24:20.000 --> 24:30.080
I thought of something similar organization being the logistical or the operational structural

24:30.640 --> 24:38.320
aspects so those would be the roads that connect the forestry outposts or the circulatory system

24:38.320 --> 24:46.960
that connects the different organs of organization and then the culture is a cause and a consequence

24:47.600 --> 24:54.960
of organization organization is the enabling conditions for culture to arise okay so given

24:54.960 --> 25:02.960
this road network what cultures arise how similar or different are they convergently what are their

25:03.840 --> 25:07.840
practices or their narratives that are shared amongst these different outposts

25:08.880 --> 25:15.680
or in the bodily example okay given the organization of the organs literally the organizing

25:16.320 --> 25:24.240
process or principle then what biosemiotics can arise with glucose and insulin and glucagon

25:25.120 --> 25:32.560
and what culturally can arise maybe even in terms of the generative model of encultured

25:33.120 --> 25:38.640
agents as a function of organization and then what are those encultured agents do

25:40.320 --> 25:45.520
to the extent that they can modify organization and so these kinds of

25:45.920 --> 25:55.360
um unrolling cause and consequence relationships can be hard to disentangle

25:56.160 --> 26:06.000
because there's not like a clean single starting point that can be separated out or because it

26:06.000 --> 26:15.360
unfolds historically it's not exactly a reaction in a test tube

26:17.280 --> 26:24.240
so how does active inference give us an entry point into thinking about this

26:26.240 --> 26:30.320
yeah that's one interesting thing about active inference that you

26:31.040 --> 26:37.760
you don't really need one uh you don't really need an origin point right you can

26:38.400 --> 26:44.560
start start modeling you start understanding that at any any given point and build up from

26:44.560 --> 26:53.760
from that story and see how it unfolds over time i think that's the most beautiful idea that you

26:53.760 --> 26:59.520
you define your parameters and then you see from that parameter that can be arbitrarily defined and

26:59.600 --> 27:07.280
you can navigate how things change within those parameters in the generative model right when

27:07.280 --> 27:13.600
you when you have your like dynamical systems for instance you have your state space they have

27:13.600 --> 27:23.680
some specific range of defining parameters that set the limits of the possible states that you're

27:23.680 --> 27:33.600
going to navigate and if you use this notion that this two densities brings about in terms of

27:33.600 --> 27:41.680
Bayesian modeling you can use these these kinds of tools to understand how from that specific

27:41.680 --> 27:51.760
parameters update why what we narrate in active inference as if belief updating can change over

27:51.760 --> 28:02.880
time in these terms that's a very nice point it reminds me of Bruno Latour's actor network theory

28:02.880 --> 28:09.600
or ants which kind of advocates a similar approach to what you describe which is like enter anywhere

28:09.600 --> 28:19.440
open-mindedly because in an iterated modeling or iterated analysis setting the first proposal

28:19.440 --> 28:26.320
or the first trace detected we know that's not the whole picture there may not be a whole or only

28:26.320 --> 28:32.320
picture so we need to enter and iterate and then with active inference specifically because of the

28:32.320 --> 28:38.560
compositionality that we get within a layer collective behavior and then also the kind of

28:38.560 --> 28:48.480
nesting smaller things inside of bigger things we can always build something and then we can go oh

28:48.480 --> 28:54.880
wow it's like there's a lot of top-down influence maybe there's a higher order factor or slower

28:54.880 --> 29:03.360
factor or a contextual factor we should consider or oh we were abstracting across these smaller

29:03.360 --> 29:16.480
things inside but for a later day or if relevance we can dive in and so then it allows a light hold

29:16.480 --> 29:24.320
or a grasp on the proposed generative model obviously it's map not territory but even

29:24.320 --> 29:32.800
beyond that we always know that we can expand laterally and across scales starting from anywhere

29:34.480 --> 29:45.280
in an iterated modeling process without our first or even 11th model being proposed as like

29:45.280 --> 29:52.160
the accounts of some complex cultural phenomena which we're always going to only ever have our

29:52.160 --> 29:59.920
own perspectives on yeah I think you don't really find that you being so oh all in copas

29:59.920 --> 30:06.400
saying like you have one model that will model them all you can you you can navigate those models

30:06.400 --> 30:13.040
in these more more instrumental terms it raises different questions when you put things like that

30:13.040 --> 30:20.320
in terms of the ontology of models and models and theories and sciences but you they can be also

30:20.320 --> 30:30.720
described as tools for describe tools for yeah tools for for grasping and describing

30:31.680 --> 30:37.120
phenomena in a more non-committal way

30:40.160 --> 30:49.040
how much that how much that smuggles in philosophical or more ontological problems

30:49.120 --> 30:54.800
it's still I think under like debate but it is still

30:57.040 --> 31:05.040
it's still uh it is still a tool to bring insights to think about specific cultural

31:06.160 --> 31:14.480
collective uh phenomena which is not it's it's complicated to because I think what I'm getting

31:14.480 --> 31:19.280
at I'm kind of like going back and forth but when you talk about social sciences and modeling

31:19.280 --> 31:26.880
usually you have like ways of modeling agents or ways of modeling collectives and active inference

31:26.880 --> 31:34.640
is trying to to come up with a a modeling in which you can understand agency and collectives

31:34.640 --> 31:42.480
within the same modeling uh schema and I think the specific specifically for these

31:42.480 --> 31:50.400
cases if you're interested in understanding uh types of cultural phenomena among language users

31:50.400 --> 32:00.080
in uh in specific contexts you can at least partially understand or have or gain some insight

32:00.080 --> 32:07.120
in this agent-collective relationship that that is a little bit more interesting than

32:07.280 --> 32:15.040
we have found so far in the social sciences because you can have like or specific understandings of

32:15.040 --> 32:21.680
means but then how the agent where is the agency in that you you lose a little bit of agency

32:22.720 --> 32:30.400
well when you're trying to understand uh only agents then you don't know how that

32:30.400 --> 32:40.400
kind of scales up because active inference tries and offers this scale free uh modeling tools

32:41.040 --> 32:49.840
that facilitates this this um conversion into agents agents and uh collectives

32:51.360 --> 32:59.040
I would be interested in asking you actually how how do you navigate that when you talk about

32:59.280 --> 33:03.360
social phenomena in ants or termites or

33:07.920 --> 33:17.280
because then yeah you have very specific coding demarcations I guess for for this uh

33:18.560 --> 33:19.520
social environments

33:19.520 --> 33:34.400
yeah it's a great question it's also whether it's a uh open wounds or a dirty closet that's just

33:34.400 --> 33:43.360
shut there's actually a lot of ambiguity and unresolved tension around well is the ant colony

33:43.360 --> 33:50.880
social are they social insects that reifies the nest mate as the individual and then what

33:50.880 --> 33:56.880
they're doing is like when we hang out and talk so reifying the nest mate as individual makes

33:56.880 --> 34:04.080
the colony social but if the colony is individual then what nest mates are doing with each other

34:04.080 --> 34:09.520
is not social anymore than we would describe the liver and the kidney as having like a social

34:09.520 --> 34:15.520
single cellular interaction but we know that would be missing the point and so there definitely is

34:15.520 --> 34:23.040
attention with some of these evolutionary lineages like ants being monophiletically

34:23.040 --> 34:31.120
obligate you social all and only ants are you social they all live in the colonies there's no

34:31.840 --> 34:38.320
free living nest mate whereas other parts of the evolutionary tree there are

34:39.760 --> 34:46.240
life histories that do look a little bit more like social collaboration that can then

34:46.960 --> 34:56.320
dissolve and so knowing what level of lock in makes something social

34:56.560 --> 35:04.800
when are we socializing and what level of lock in goes beyond social and it kind of like makes

35:04.800 --> 35:14.640
when the blanket is so strong around the social that like for multi-cellularity that it it's kind

35:14.640 --> 35:22.400
of losing the social feature again because if we just use social to mean the connective tissue

35:22.400 --> 35:34.480
or the kind of lubricant or the spaces between everything then it means nothing so a real attention

35:34.480 --> 35:46.080
is what space does the social account for and is this going to be a concept with a lot of creep

35:46.240 --> 35:52.960
looking well it's a social relationship between the roots of the tree and the fungus and it's a

35:52.960 --> 35:59.360
social relationship amongst the molecules in the test tube is that too broad of a social conception

36:01.200 --> 36:08.720
are there downsides or are there trade-offs associated with a broader social concept

36:08.800 --> 36:14.400
social concept do we dilute what the social means and then on the other side

36:15.600 --> 36:22.480
might we exclude phenomena that could importantly be considered social

36:24.080 --> 36:28.880
well that's not social they're just talking on a train it's like well that's the other side

36:28.880 --> 36:35.920
if we were to have carving out encounters that we do want to include as social and

36:35.920 --> 36:46.480
and is there a true social does active inference help us sidestep or at least negotiate this territory

36:48.240 --> 36:54.880
because we could develop a generative model or an ecosystem of shared intelligence with

36:55.600 --> 37:05.360
one person and two internet of things devices and a bird and a metronome and just say we made

37:05.360 --> 37:15.520
what we made and then leave it as a second-order interpretation whether that is a social setting

37:19.440 --> 37:26.000
I mean I think you you are pointing at like how I think granularity of those scales right

37:26.000 --> 37:30.480
if you have a model that I want you want to everything that you already have it's probably

37:30.480 --> 37:37.760
not interesting and not informative because you cannot like define those limits of what you're

37:37.760 --> 37:44.320
trying to understand and in the other hand when you do that when you define those limits if you're

37:44.320 --> 37:51.680
too narrow or you're gonna leave out you're gonna idealize also in a way right and leave out many

37:51.680 --> 37:59.280
other parts of the system that you're interested in but if you don't do that if you don't

38:02.080 --> 38:07.360
if you don't make this if you don't make this decision when modeling you think then how

38:09.120 --> 38:19.040
how you can have any access to the phenomena right and and to connect this to the forestry

38:19.040 --> 38:29.680
so in the forestry example the disirata was lumber now that may have been a very narrowly scoped

38:30.640 --> 38:38.320
desire but it's it's a relevant thing to to want this resource and then industrialization

38:38.880 --> 38:47.760
science as a process professionalization those allow the description and and the handling and

38:47.760 --> 38:54.560
ultimately the kind of top-down legibility and control thinking like a forestry company now

38:55.360 --> 39:02.240
with respect to the social sciences by analogy to forestry science so now we're entering an

39:02.240 --> 39:12.800
era of increased legibility and control of social systems and human natural capital and

39:12.800 --> 39:22.800
attention as a resource trust as a resource in a way is being cropped analogous to produce the

39:22.800 --> 39:30.960
content of lumber but now there are social content so as the social goes from being just

39:31.840 --> 39:38.880
only simply the water we swim in not something that's even compared counterfactually to alternative

39:39.840 --> 39:49.360
cultural possibilities per se but falls under the scope of the professional management like

39:49.360 --> 39:56.720
forestry then that's when this discussion of well what's the lumber and what is the weeds that are

39:56.720 --> 40:06.640
being pruned and what ecosystem services when we pay attention to certain parts of human social

40:06.720 --> 40:16.880
culture and when we seek to make more of this kind of lumber what else does that come along with

40:18.560 --> 40:26.720
and what decisions come into play and that comes along when you see

40:36.800 --> 40:38.320
you

40:58.240 --> 41:02.560
or instagram i don't know twitter after what happened to twitter but

41:07.360 --> 41:16.080
but yeah the in terms of attention pruning you do have that very effectively already happening

41:16.080 --> 41:24.800
already you can see how that happens if efficiently in the world in elections for instance it can be

41:24.800 --> 41:32.160
very very easily manipulated and we saw what happened in elections for instance in brazil or in

41:32.160 --> 41:46.720
the u.s and well all over you navigate a system of attention organization that

41:47.680 --> 41:52.160
selects in only what he thinks that you're interested in

41:55.040 --> 42:00.640
in the effects of that in terms of decision making and in terms of trust in terms of

42:02.480 --> 42:09.680
diversity of discourse we have seen that it can be devastating

42:11.760 --> 42:17.600
so the and the question would be like how can you make this a little bit how can you use active

42:17.600 --> 42:25.440
inference and these tools that we have to make this kind of technology a little bit more inclusive

42:25.440 --> 42:30.400
without being super also disruptive is it even like

42:36.640 --> 42:41.680
a possibility i really don't know i think it's an ethical problem that we have when we talk about

42:41.680 --> 42:47.440
social systems and these principles of attention exclusion leaving things out

42:56.400 --> 43:05.440
lot to say on that um with modeling and interpolating and models whether it's large

43:05.440 --> 43:16.000
language model type or linear regression type it is able to interpolate to put data points within

43:17.680 --> 43:25.040
an enclosure of what has already been described and Bayesian statistics and other types of

43:25.040 --> 43:31.760
prediction algorithms are not immune to that either if we have some prior distribution belief

43:32.640 --> 43:37.760
um we believe it's possible for it to be between 20 and 30 degrees outside

43:39.520 --> 43:47.440
then when we get data inside of our bounds we can converge and that actually

43:47.440 --> 43:53.680
tightens our beliefs not always a bad thing of course and then outside of the scope of the

43:53.680 --> 44:00.080
possible those data are just seen as noise and they may not even be integrated so then that

44:00.080 --> 44:08.000
can lead to a reinforcing process not necessarily an adaptive one either where information that's

44:08.000 --> 44:15.040
confirmatory is used to ratchet and increase precision and then information that is not

44:15.040 --> 44:19.200
confirmatory is discarded as not useful

44:19.440 --> 44:29.840
it doesn't yeah in this case is yeah it doesn't even enter the uh the landscape

44:31.360 --> 44:33.280
of attention of the user in

44:39.040 --> 44:45.520
what i what i'm what i was thinking in relation to this no this idea of

44:45.520 --> 44:57.120
uh a forestry is because we have now organizational principles that are faster and

45:00.880 --> 45:10.400
more populated with uh information and attention grabbing kinds of prompts

45:10.400 --> 45:14.400
we transformed the same

45:20.800 --> 45:23.200
we just from the same principle into

45:31.680 --> 45:39.200
a harder to grasp process it's it's hard it becomes more complex it becomes harder to

45:40.000 --> 45:47.040
describe this the process of understanding that in terms of forestry is kind of way more grounded

45:47.680 --> 45:54.800
when you apply that socially to this kind of environment that we're talking like internet or

45:54.880 --> 45:59.760
is highly uh volatile

46:04.240 --> 46:11.280
and virtual in principle in environment it becomes much harder to assess what is being

46:11.280 --> 46:15.360
pruned out or not you just don't know it makes it more clear that

46:17.680 --> 46:22.160
there is a process of pruning you need to have no control of what is being taken out

46:23.120 --> 46:29.760
you have no idea what's being like left away from your perspective of attention

46:32.800 --> 46:41.760
so to this topic of intended or unintended semantic pruning i think um this has helped me

46:42.320 --> 46:48.640
identify attention if we want to talk about the semantics or semiotics biosemionics whatever we

46:48.640 --> 46:58.960
want to call it of the letter e in relationship to letter a we're looking for an account that might

46:58.960 --> 47:07.600
convey letterness but we're generalized above enus or anus so in some ways we've erased or

47:07.600 --> 47:18.320
abstracted generalized away from the particulars of the sign's meaning by taking a semiotic

47:18.320 --> 47:28.960
perspective and so it's like we got into the game to have a semantic account of biological

47:28.960 --> 47:43.360
phenomena or of any phenomena for biological entity yet this process in a sense distances us

47:43.360 --> 47:51.360
from the particulars that actually do grant it that meaning in the actuality like if we

47:51.360 --> 47:57.440
walk into a sacred space and it's like oh well that is just doing that over there and this

47:57.440 --> 48:02.560
architecture is doing this and because of the layout people must use the room this way

48:03.520 --> 48:17.440
that's removed from the actual meaning which is the cause and consequence with the organization and

48:17.440 --> 48:29.840
culture that we discussed but that prima facia account doesn't generalize get any generalization

48:29.840 --> 48:35.920
that we make so that we can talk about multiple places or multiple letters on a common

48:36.560 --> 48:40.640
accounting framework is going to remove those particularities

48:43.840 --> 48:49.040
so it's a very challenging catch 22 whether we want to really

48:50.400 --> 48:58.480
account for the n equals one and maybe even live and act and play and work in the n equals one

48:58.480 --> 49:05.680
versus develop something that might be satisfying and cut and dry but it's always going to be on

49:05.680 --> 49:15.920
the sidelines with respect to what it actually means but what do you mean like is i don't understand

49:15.920 --> 49:21.600
what you what you're getting at like is it you mean like it's generalized or not generalized

49:22.160 --> 49:28.240
i didn't get that like when we have a general when we generalize when we

49:30.240 --> 49:36.240
ask what words mean what what words mean beyond any given word we've lost touch with

49:36.240 --> 49:44.720
what any given word means but words are what they actually mean in a situation

49:45.360 --> 49:53.600
so it's just in this scientific approach to meaning semiotics and semantics

49:58.000 --> 50:06.400
we have these two tensions or a tension to reconcile between actually giving an account

50:06.400 --> 50:10.320
of the meaningfulness of the specific thing

50:12.880 --> 50:16.080
versus taking a more scientific approach which would be

50:17.360 --> 50:23.360
gathering a group of similar things and finding their shared attributes

50:25.200 --> 50:28.640
which out of necessity must abstract must crop out

50:29.440 --> 50:41.440
features that are are empirically or anecdotally taken to not matter like we abstract whether it

50:41.440 --> 50:46.960
was a monday or tuesday that we did the experiments we just combine all of our replicates together

50:46.960 --> 50:48.560
when we do the scientific analysis

50:48.640 --> 50:57.280
you mean you mean if you generalize the practice you lose

50:58.560 --> 51:03.280
what you're being if you generalize it too much you lose everything that's meaningful to it in

51:03.280 --> 51:11.440
terms of like for you formalize it and then you have no yeah you have an empty semantics you

51:11.440 --> 51:16.960
have a semantics with no meaning that can only be meaningful in terms of how you apply that in

51:17.040 --> 51:22.320
terms of specific practices yeah it's like i i have a framework for you know the formal meaning

51:22.320 --> 51:28.000
of letters within words within sentences within paragraphs and then it's like well but now what's

51:28.000 --> 51:35.600
your next n equals one word that you're actually going to bring it's not just about building some

51:35.600 --> 51:41.440
abstract scaffold yeah for bigger and bigger boulders of meaning

51:42.400 --> 51:46.240
at some point through our embodied thought and action

51:48.480 --> 51:51.760
in our experience it is going to come down into the particulars

51:53.440 --> 51:58.000
and it doesn't immediately seem clear that simply generalizing further

52:01.040 --> 52:01.920
brings us there

52:03.920 --> 52:10.800
yeah yeah particularly i don't really believe you can have that kind of generalization i think

52:11.680 --> 52:20.080
we attempt to build whatever what i see that's the interesting aspect of the formal semantics

52:20.080 --> 52:22.400
you try to build this more general

52:26.000 --> 52:33.520
understanding that's just formalizes to model but for that to be meaningful it has to be embedded

52:33.520 --> 52:40.560
in a way of practicing it like in a forestry practice you have to be embedded in a cultural

52:40.560 --> 52:48.720
environment in which that can be actually uh observed in terms of what happens when

52:49.520 --> 52:52.800
a generative model is being updated or not

52:55.600 --> 53:00.320
is that what you mean because otherwise i don't really understand how it becomes too

53:02.160 --> 53:09.840
yeah it becomes too formal it becomes too abstract in terms of some i would not understand

53:09.840 --> 53:12.640
what that is

53:15.600 --> 53:23.680
i'll i'll think of a little more um brand or tj do you want to add any thoughts or questions

53:26.080 --> 53:31.520
yeah sorry i i think like i don't have a lot of context i've been like following some of the

53:31.520 --> 53:41.760
discussion but not attended a lot of these calls i'm like it's all yeah yeah um yeah i didn't know

53:41.760 --> 53:49.360
i think um yeah i'm in general just sort of interested in trying to understand the relationship

53:49.360 --> 53:59.920
between um yeah like sorts of like constructionist epistemologies and um yeah like generative models

53:59.920 --> 54:08.160
and active inference style stuff and um how active inference style like yeah what are the

54:08.160 --> 54:13.520
philosophical commitments that active inference involves with respect to knowledge and epistemology

54:13.520 --> 54:20.400
and there's a sense in which like rational choice models often assume a certain sort of like

54:22.160 --> 54:26.960
objectivity to beliefs and then desires are where most of the degrees of freedom lie or something

54:27.520 --> 54:32.480
um whereas there's a lot of like issue like there's a lot of things that come up once you

54:32.480 --> 54:38.400
start talking about reflexivities where concepts themselves become self-fulfilling prophecies

54:39.360 --> 54:44.960
what you believe about what your beliefs about society and shaping the society itself so there's

54:44.960 --> 54:50.240
the sense in which there's a score dependence between the object of knowledge and knowledge about

54:50.240 --> 54:56.720
that object itself and i think yeah like i'm sort of interested in like how the active

54:56.720 --> 55:02.960
entrance ways of thinking about this offers what perspectives on those questions and stuff like

55:02.960 --> 55:15.840
that um yeah thank you great questions yeah so when you talk about the uh object of knowledge

55:15.840 --> 55:21.760
and knowledge itself and active inference uh

55:28.320 --> 55:34.080
i think you you you can think of in terms of this

55:38.240 --> 55:40.960
well there's a few ways to think about that i guess

55:41.360 --> 55:50.640
uh the knowledge itself it has to come epistemically from where your agent

55:50.640 --> 55:56.560
is actually embedded and situated in specifically an active inference it's embodied

55:57.280 --> 56:04.960
it kind of needs to have a model the model is modeling a body is modeling a body that is in

56:04.960 --> 56:12.400
the world and it's all the time uh situated is never disconnected to its environment and it's

56:12.400 --> 56:22.720
history and how the history of that environment right yeah uh but if you think if you push that

56:22.720 --> 56:28.080
to the object of that knowledge uh i don't know how how different

56:32.240 --> 56:32.800
that will

56:35.600 --> 56:41.280
how different how can you differ differentiate that so sharply when you talk about active inference

56:41.920 --> 56:43.440
because

56:45.920 --> 56:56.640
if you think of uh in terms of a generative model then what will be updated comes is updated from

56:56.640 --> 57:08.720
a prior that is always directed in this body in this situated realm so they sort of conflated

57:08.800 --> 57:16.240
as i see maybe a maybe a mistaken but they sort of correlate in how you're gonna update your

57:16.240 --> 57:24.480
generative model which it will be at the same time in at the same time what you know and what you

57:24.480 --> 57:32.400
the object of this knowledge still i sorry if i can just like uh raise a question to that

57:32.400 --> 57:37.520
yeah so i think like i think that there is a sense in which like with respect to

57:38.400 --> 57:43.440
something that in epistemology we call self knowledge there is there is a question here

57:43.440 --> 57:52.240
that the the active inference agent has this model of that is like situated in the body or like in

57:52.240 --> 58:01.040
in its like um like structure and is also modeling that structure itself and there is like this issue

58:01.040 --> 58:07.840
of like where where yeah like the belief is not unidirectionally dependent on the object

58:07.840 --> 58:13.680
sort of a thing but has this feedback loop thing comes up there but there's another way in which

58:13.680 --> 58:20.000
i think like uh where this sort of thing comes where even if the object is outside of the body

58:20.800 --> 58:27.760
of the knowledge i think that that could still come up so for instance if i live in it if an

58:27.760 --> 58:34.720
active inference agent lives in a society of other active inference agents where currently all of them

58:34.720 --> 58:42.080
defect on prisoner's dilemma but maybe like on further reflection they would want to like again

58:42.080 --> 58:45.920
like i don't know what further reflection would mean in the active inference sense but i'm like just

58:45.920 --> 58:53.040
saying in the intuitive sense like that what would it mean for them to like go from one fixed point

58:53.120 --> 58:57.760
to another fixed point where they're all cooperating or or or something like that and

58:58.720 --> 59:04.640
that that i think is not clear to me like how that shift can happen in active inference where

59:05.440 --> 59:14.400
it's not just purely using the empirical information to keep running the the the middle of the of your

59:15.360 --> 59:25.120
like free energy equation but also recognizing the contingencies and then identifying those

59:25.120 --> 59:33.120
contingencies to make something like shifts from one state to another like if if i model that the

59:33.120 --> 59:38.400
society is a cruel space and if everyone models the society is a cruel space then we will end up

59:38.400 --> 59:44.240
creating a society that is a cruel space but if only we could recognize that our belief or our

59:44.240 --> 59:51.120
model that society is a cool space is a contingent belief and we could all somehow negotiate or

59:51.680 --> 59:58.320
communicate and shift to a different belief about what society is and society is a kind

59:58.320 --> 01:00:06.560
place then we will end up creating that kinder society or something and that sort of like a

01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:12.880
belief about the thing that society is it's not entirely within the agent like it's sort of

01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:19.600
it it has a weird intersubjective character so it's not entirely outside of the agent either

01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:28.960
but it's not entirely like internal to the agent either or something yeah yeah you can think of

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:34.560
that like you're talking about active inference action comes first right you have to you don't

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:41.520
have the knowledge like inside your head waiting for you to to push that out of the way action has

01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:50.240
to come first so if you if you take that as a principle an organizing principle it depends on

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:58.000
the contingency of your actions the possibilities might be limited by your situated um condition

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:04.720
but they are limited it doesn't mean that you don't have like a range of options from that state

01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:11.360
space in which you can go you can navigate so you can navigate it for the good or for the bad

01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:17.520
but it starts with the the action perception loop it starts with the action

01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:28.880
a lot of few other pieces on that teach a very good point like when we see the pragmatic component

01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:36.400
of action as self-fulfilling epistemic component of action having to do with gaining knowledge and

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:40.880
the salience of information but the pragmatic component is about bringing our observations

01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:47.600
into alignment with our preferences and then you identified two related settings one of them is like

01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:57.440
pure intra subjectivity like I expect myself or I find myself or I habitually think about x well

01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:03.520
that's kind of a trivial self-fulfillment because thinking about something is its own

01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:12.800
fulfillment and then when we're in this second person or social space we can agree on little

01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:20.960
performance art or on a game and games give evidence to that that when people are able to

01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:28.640
perform communication or message passing such that new expectations or preferences are set

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:35.840
whether more top down like more seeing like a state or more laterally more like collective

01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:42.640
behavior then those regimes can be embodied and then you brought up a very important point about

01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:47.840
the awareness of the contingencies or where awareness is of adjacent possibles or of counter

01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:57.040
factuals so the body might be we could model its morphology as doing some computation but that

01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:02.080
doesn't mean that the the morphology has an awareness or can explore a counterfactual

01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:10.560
like bodies are not always exploring every counterfactual because skin is in the game

01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:18.880
but again mentally it's very cheap and easy to consider counterfactuals and situational awareness

01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:26.640
of social settings especially if it can be not understood but communicated opens up a space

01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:32.080
where we're all playing prisoner's dilemma now there's parameterizations of prisoners multi-agent

01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:39.600
prisoner's dilemma where tragically we just all defect all day and never learn there's also

01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:45.920
parameterizations where you just start all cooperating and never defect and then the interesting

01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:52.400
settings are where there might be like phase transitions or where perturbation moves the

01:03:52.400 --> 01:04:02.000
system from one attractor into another attractor so there's just a lot of richness and that's the

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:10.480
work of building generative models in that iterated modeling process to unpack and refine

01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:18.000
and active inference isn't going to have a stance on the prisoner's dilemma we can use

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:22.560
active inference to to describe the prisoner's dilemma but active inference isn't going to come

01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:29.440
down on on literally even a little two by two game theory matrix so we can then extrapolate that

01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:35.280
active inference is not going to come down with an opinion on something significantly

01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:50.960
more rich and real than a two by two game theory matrix and so that work is what people enact in

01:04:50.960 --> 01:05:02.400
applying active inference right and i think like my question is something like but insofar as like

01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:13.200
humans try to constantly improve their social games how can we model that sort of a prior

01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:18.720
or your actions or policies that enables that sort of like progressive

01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:25.520
improvements or something well

01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:33.280
you can we are assuming that we're trying to improve right we we don't know that but you

01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:42.080
can model them as improving but like following Daniel's lead we're talking about these specific

01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:47.280
games and contingencies they they did these these transitions from one state to another

01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:53.760
specifically if you're talking about this modeling of social actors and talking about

01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:59.360
several actors if you're modeling several of them will not be really linear right you don't

01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:10.080
have like a easy smooth transition of improvement you can capture over time as modeling how they

01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:17.520
might tend to go towards a direction and understand that as improvement but that takes

01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:25.360
specific iterations that will not be fully linear i guess specifically if you want to

01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:33.520
understand error and improvement instead of try an error but try and adding up into this

01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:41.760
error like error improvement but when you're modeling specifically with dynamical systems

01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:46.400
for instance you you you're not going to see a full linear story and i don't think you're

01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:53.680
going to see that uh if you're modeling using active inference and multiple agents agents

01:06:53.680 --> 01:07:05.040
i'll add one piece there so how can we go about modeling multi-scale social goals so

01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:15.760
we could think about you know different citizens in a region and they the modeler is going to

01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:24.800
choose what knowledge to realize in the generative model like what you put into the calculator it's

01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:36.080
going to calculate upon now this happens to be a elaborate stochastic method but if we only tell

01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:41.360
people yeah there's just your personal income optimized for that your preference is to have

01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:47.200
that be higher well then the simulation is going to unfold a certain way if we say well there's

01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:54.960
your personal financial income and then there's your city and then there's your region then that

01:07:54.960 --> 01:08:04.000
opens up through through different mechanisms you know maybe an individual goes flat or neutral

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:11.600
on the personal in service of a larger win at a higher level well now what if the modeler says

01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:15.760
it's not just about the financial income now we're also going to have this secondary criterion

01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:23.600
well now different agents could attend differently to those two different outcome variables

01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:30.640
and maybe there's one simulation where 50 only care about this and 50 care about that and it

01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:42.240
works perfect or it doesn't work it's like a broad surveying you know or lego set or or grammar

01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:56.080
or or active inference ontology for scoping very broadly and very inclusively but all the work is

01:08:56.080 --> 01:09:09.280
in the real simulation developments and sweeping because very little could be said about a game

01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:15.600
theory game if you didn't know what the parameters were in the matrix you wouldn't know whether this

01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:20.880
prisoner's dilemma was going to be like an always cooperate or which agents with which strategies

01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:28.000
would or wouldn't cooperate if you don't know what the matrix looks like so before the values have

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:35.920
kind of been filled in it's just like actually describing the adjacencies and the counterfactuals

01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:44.720
and the contingencies of our scientific model but that's still prior to having the model in hand

01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:50.160
and the model you know so now we're looking at that tree in the european forest

01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:54.480
and it's like well if i had this tool then i could cut it down this way if i had this tool

01:09:54.480 --> 01:10:03.520
i could cut it down this way or i could wait it's like that's alternative actions about that tree

01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:09.920
now in the social science setting discussion of different scientific methodologies are like

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:14.240
counterfactuals about that social tree

01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:33.440
yeah and specifically if you're navigating these kinds of game theoretical models if that's what

01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:40.160
you're interested in you can even define in terms of prisoner's dilemma for instance

01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:52.960
specific values just see what happens when everybody deflects and in how frequent

01:10:53.920 --> 01:11:00.960
modulate those frequencies in terms of specific in multiple iterations how

01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:11.680
how how are you gonna build up the weight or the tendency of deflecting again if your neighbor

01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:20.080
deflected once and deflected twice or three times or and see how that will accommodate

01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:28.160
over time how many times this agent will change its behavior until it stops changing the behavior

01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:31.120
but that you don't really

01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:41.120
that's that that again you use you might use a bayesian understanding a bayesian model for that

01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:44.000
but it not necessarily explain

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:49.840
me

01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:59.520
he does not necessarily explain the action fully i mean social you just you're modeling only the

01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:11.120
interest of that specific actor i have a slightly meta question if i can ask both of you i'm not

01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:18.080
sure how these calls usually go i'm curious what are your interests in active inference what do you

01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:23.280
think like what brings you to active inference and like what do you think what do you think active

01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:30.960
inference adds to our theoretical understanding and in what ways or something the right now go for it

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:34.240
well

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:44.240
i think i was trying to touch upon that before and how we can if you're navigating for instance

01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:48.800
behavior in terms of game theory this kind of modeling if you're talking about like

01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:55.760
trust games for instance you're gonna understand how this do addict interactions evolve over time

01:12:55.840 --> 01:13:03.200
specifically over interactions but you don't have an account of change because i have very

01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:11.520
limited options of actions and you don't have an account also on scales and i think active

01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:16.720
inference tries to add a little bit an account on how you can scale that and how

01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:19.680
how

01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:29.600
how can add more parameters into the game and see how they evolve with a more clear

01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:36.080
understanding a richer understanding that for instance when you talk about specific

01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:45.600
interactions in game theory so when that's one one aspect that active inference kind of

01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:54.320
contributes another point is because we have this parameterization that is

01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:59.920
specifically in terms of belief updating and also in terms of dynamics

01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:09.440
we are always talking about agents that will be situated and embodied and have a very specific

01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:11.440
uh

01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:19.680
synchronization with the environment all the time because when you talk about active inference

01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:25.840
the action comes always first so you have a less you try to have a less reductive model

01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:34.160
specific and when you want to model cultural agents and collective action i think that's

01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:42.640
kind of desirable that's what you're looking for is it also your area of interest sorry is it also

01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:54.240
your area of interest mine or is that laryna's area of interest laryna's what do you mean oh sorry

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:59.280
like my question was also like what brings you to active inference and i think you answered a lot

01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:05.760
of ways in which active inference adds theoretical value but i wasn't sure like if that was also

01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:11.840
your subjective interest or motivation it's my subjective interest yeah i'm curious to see how

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:19.600
that pans out right i'm interested in how that helps us to to think of this type of

01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:22.720
uh

01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:30.160
phenomena and i'm very interested in how this relationship for agents to collectives and back

01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:31.360
again work like

01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:43.440
and i think it might give us some well it gives us some very insightful way of modeling

01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:45.440
these relationships

01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:55.600
in navigating is as you want because this this uh feature of being scale free is kind of helpful

01:15:57.120 --> 01:16:04.000
to looking things you can you can define your uh mark of blanket in terms of what you're interested

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.560
right and see what happens

01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:16.800
i don't know yeah i'll i'll i'll just give a few thoughts even though also surely some of these

01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:24.880
thoughts are are scattered um you asked tj what does active inference add to our theoretical

01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:33.200
accounts of the social it does many things in in my view and that's what makes it so valuable

01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:42.080
epistemically and pragmatically it gives us the expressivity within a scale to describe

01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:49.200
collective behavior and across scales to describe nested systems so that brings continuity to

01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:54.880
discussions of the social with broader discussions of the biological ecological

01:16:55.520 --> 01:17:01.760
computational physical and so on so that's a multi-scale transdisciplinary element

01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:09.840
active inference provides us with legible first principles which can either be taken

01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:18.400
instrumentally as just heretics and also in certain situations can be viewed empirically

01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:26.720
as justifiable first principles and then from those legible first principles which are not

01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:34.240
english specific they're already in a space that has a lot more

01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:45.120
possibility and promise then for example a mere enumeration of important adjectives or nouns

01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:50.000
we can develop lists of important adjectives and nouns

01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:58.720
when we have a broader cognitive modeling framework and so this methodological turn

01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:07.440
then supports just a tremendous diversity of thought and work instead of asking us to kind of

01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:13.520
go through the eye of the needle and you know get on board with this one ranking of features

01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:20.000
and then try to apply it more broadly that's like an overfit before the cart situation

01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:27.680
with active we can expand the methodological discussion connect it to theoretical physics

01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:33.440
and mathematics in ways that really haven't been seen before and then that opens up more

01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:42.000
than it closes down it brings up more questions than it resolves in and of itself but it opens

01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:49.680
the questions that can be resolved like what generative model can I make that will keep the

01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:55.360
temperature in this building livable but active inference isn't going to have a stance on what

01:18:55.360 --> 01:19:03.280
you should do for that building so we need to in a way take a step in the methodological direction

01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:12.480
which I see as moving towards active inference to enable a million steps in different directions

01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:24.320
I have a bunch of questions here I think one is probably just a reference question

01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:30.960
the three topics that I'll say if you guys have any papers or articles on those things I would love

01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:39.520
to like get a reference one is in what ways can we model a collection or an aggregation of active

01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:48.240
inference asians as a like super agent or like super like active inference super agent or something

01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:54.880
and like how does this like decomposition and aggregation like flexibility work in different

01:19:54.880 --> 01:20:02.560
contexts like if there's like work that tries to either make informal commentary or formal

01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:09.520
modeling either ways I would love to see that secondly just quick on the first just on the first

01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:16.800
check out the previous section of this course on collective behavior where I reviewed many

01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:23.920
such works great thanks okay is it on the same notion is it linked from the same notion things

01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:30.400
all in the same places and in the same playlist with this course same syllabus yes good okay

01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:40.640
the second is is there an active inference account of say markets or economic interaction

01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:48.560
where like your prices act as some sorts of like information signals and like like can use active

01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:55.200
inference to then talk about aggregation in of market entities or something I'm guessing this

01:20:55.200 --> 01:21:01.600
would also be covered in the same list indeed people have explored cognitive economics and

01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:07.200
people are working on it but that doesn't mean it's a done deal theoretically or especially in

01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:13.760
practice so keep going it's quite experimental still but there are a bunch of people working on

01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:22.800
that I guess I don't remember any specific paper right now but I can I can look it up and forward

01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:31.200
to you but yeah yeah it would be great I can drop my email address here yeah sure the third is

01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:36.880
probably more trickier than both of these which is is there an active inference account of natural

01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:48.640
language um yes thankfully colleagues like Elliot Murphy and others have explored specifically

01:21:48.640 --> 01:21:59.920
the linguistic aspects of natural speech I think Lorena's lecture and area of focus generalizes

01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:07.360
a bit beyond specific natural language because we're talking about semiotics and semantics

01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:14.960
in a more intermodal sense however yes there's been limited work from a computational

01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:24.400
linguistics and neurobiology perspective on speech okay so then

01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:33.840
okay so you said something like first principles stuff when you're making a commentary on what

01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:39.680
active inference brings I have still I have I'm still often like struggling what is active

01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:45.200
inference offering and I like try to encounter different things I think I enjoy a lot of

01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:50.560
philosophical questions at the conversation opens up but like I'm still like very ambivalent about

01:22:50.560 --> 01:22:59.120
the theory um and when I read like this new book uh which Friston has not written uh but like is

01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:07.280
and quarter I don't remember was the name of the book um uh yeah I don't exactly remember there's

01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:12.960
a book right which is like supposedly like supposed to be the canon and like Friston as a

01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:23.280
co-author but in the preface he says so so that's the 2022 par Friston Pazulo textbook right par yeah

01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:31.360
yeah I wouldn't quite say it's the canon since it's a short book but certainly it is a landmark

01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:38.880
moment for the fields right and when I read that the one thing that bothered me was

01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:49.680
it brings up the Helmholtz free energy thing but it sort of argues that by fiat like okay this is a

01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:57.280
simple principle it can model a lot of things but that doesn't tell me why I should why I should

01:23:57.280 --> 01:24:04.320
trust it like what what is the reason to act why why does this principle lead to cognition like

01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:10.720
what like sure you're positive a very simple principle and then said hey look this simple

01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:16.320
principle can explain so many things but well it can it also explain things that don't look like

01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:24.880
cognition and like I like I'm not sure like there's an I got an account of why that principle is like

01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:34.400
uh works or something the rain I go for it I'll think of some other ways to say it yeah you can

01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:41.440
think of like modeling by construction and modeling by first principles and if modeling by first

01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:49.840
principles you have you have some limitations in which you cannot fully explain some things but

01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:55.520
the virtue of the model and how the first principle organizes everything that comes along with the

01:24:55.520 --> 01:25:03.120
model usually might be sufficient or might be a useful a useful tool to help you explain that

01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:10.800
phenomena that based on the first principle that you were bringing along and that's one way of

01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:17.120
one part of answering this question is I think it might be a big question for the for the field

01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:24.080
for the field yeah here here's some short little threads on that

01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:32.480
yeah we can describe maladaptive cognitive systems or adaptive cognitive systems whether

01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:38.080
something's adaptive or not is always in relationship to its niche like the foraging algorithm that

01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:44.320
works in the desert doesn't necessarily work in the rainforest so these systems are like intrinsically

01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:52.080
adaptive or not we want to have natural language that allows sentences that are valid and invalid

01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:56.880
and have different kinds of semantics so again this is just an expressivity framework

01:25:57.680 --> 01:26:05.520
that enables people to build cognitive models of high reliability or important settings or you

01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:11.040
could make something that looks just like a beautiful circuit board and not even worry about

01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:16.400
what the outcome is so yeah for sure you can describe all kinds of systems that would be like

01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:23.600
having a less than functional methodological system if we said well we're doing the linear

01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:28.240
regression framework but we only want positive regressions it's like well no at the methodological

01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:34.000
level we want it to be able to do any slope so here in the cognitive modeling setting we want

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:38.480
more expressivity so that we can actually construct the ones that we're interested in

01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:48.400
and then how does this really do cognition how is it that a first principles like surprise

01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:54.000
minimization or the bounding of surprise through free energy how can that really cover

01:26:55.120 --> 01:27:02.800
so many cognitive phenomena that's the question and the play but how is it that

01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:08.880
Newton's laws of motion can describe so many objects being dropped off a tower

01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:17.840
how is it that Bayesian mechanics can describe so many different priors being updated

01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:26.080
and so by understanding cognitive paths as paths of least action which is the free energy principle

01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:43.600
a wide variety of models become of a of a similar kind now yeah whether that's useful to a given

01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:47.920
person in a given setting like if you make an active inference model of your business it doesn't

01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:52.000
mean you're gonna succeed if you make a self-driving car with active inference it doesn't mean it's

01:27:52.000 --> 01:28:01.040
gonna work this isn't a guarantee of success but it's a method that can be utilized and we know

01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:08.720
that the method reaches different kinds of modeling outcomes and supports subsequent

01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:15.920
perspectives and models from where it reaches but we can't a priori limit where the method reaches

01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:22.080
to like only the successful ones or only biological systems then we wouldn't even have

01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:26.480
the expressivity to talk about cognitive ecosystems with synthetic intelligences

01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:34.800
um and when you're talking about cognition also we can use this kind of first principles

01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:41.200
to model aspects of cognition but you might not necessarily think that cognition is all encompassing

01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:46.800
like that everywhere all the same but you can ease that to model specific things that you're

01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:53.760
interested in in cognitive behavior like adaptivity does it give me any insight to understand what is

01:28:53.760 --> 01:29:00.640
adaptive adaptive behavior for instance and which kind of insights do i get are they interesting

01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:07.760
are they useful so that's what the availability that this kind of model bring along so you can

01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:12.880
you don't have to believe in in the whole story but it gives you a lot of leverage

01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:17.440
to ask ask questions and what kind of questions you'll be asking

01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:27.200
okay so let's say that like free like active inference and free energy allows me to talk about

01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:36.800
systems but does it give also give me vocabulary to then classify those systems

01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:43.280
in terms of let's say adaptivity would be one property but like there could be other properties

01:29:43.280 --> 01:29:54.000
in terms of like how much how rich the world model is or stuff like that or yeah um if you have

01:29:54.640 --> 01:30:00.880
a portfolio of generative models you could summarize them according to the tj statistic

01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:06.960
you could summarize them according to the number of nodes you could put them into a common environment

01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:13.200
or different environments and summarize their activity in any number of ways but we can't

01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:19.840
talk about a ranking or summarization of a portfolio of generative models that's not in hand

01:30:20.720 --> 01:30:24.080
this is a framework that lets us build those diverse generative models

01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:30.880
and then in a very open-ended way do model comparison model selection model adequacy

01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:38.880
all the kinds of complex systems engineering methods that we want

01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:50.320
and also I would ask you where do you see a peer or a comparison first principle

01:30:51.680 --> 01:30:56.240
you know active inference has legible first principles which are reflected in the active

01:30:56.240 --> 01:31:01.360
inference ontology and expressions using it which can be represented in natural language so that's

01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:08.080
the talking about it but it's not only represented in natural language other frameworks have other

01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:15.440
first principles that may or may not be legible and people may choose different paths to go down

01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:22.560
for whichever number of reasons well right models like they have the virtue you can compare them

01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:27.120
and see which one gives you the best insight that you're looking for

01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:35.360
well so yeah I think like something that I could compare to active inference is like say the

01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:42.800
Bayesian utility maximization thing and which has a different ontology I'm not a fan of that either

01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:50.320
like that also I'll just note that Bayesian utility maximization is a special case of free energy

01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:58.160
where there's no epistemic value all you have is pragmatic value and so a special diminished case

01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:03.520
not necessarily you have value of information and you have explore exploit trade-offs

01:32:04.320 --> 01:32:11.440
in Bayesian utility maximization as well like you like like if you load into your utility function

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:18.000
if you can beg the question and load episteme into pragma you're right then all you need is

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:24.800
pragma but in expected free energy we have epistemic and pragmatic value which is what enables

01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:33.760
us this expressivity but I think we're aligned on that right I think like I'm somewhat like also

01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:38.640
slightly confused because in the Bayesian utility like between the languages comparing the languages

01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:46.880
as such like in the Bayesian utility maximization the exploration parts that are prioritized based on

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:58.800
your X and the estimation on the value of information whereas I'm not sure that holds true

01:32:58.800 --> 01:33:07.280
for the active inference model as well that the epistemic exploration is prioritized or valued

01:33:07.280 --> 01:33:20.640
in terms of some of the same pragmatic thing as well. You'll have a lot to explore and learn

01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:27.520
you can make a model that is 80-20 or 20-80 or 100-0 between epistemic and pragmatic

01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:32.640
there's nothing we can say across generative models about whether active inference prioritizes

01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:42.800
episteme or not because you can make a model that's 100% or 0. Sorry I meant more like does active

01:33:42.800 --> 01:33:48.000
inference allow us to talk about systems that the Bayesian utility maximization doesn't allow us to

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:55.360
talk about. I'm talking particularly about expressive power of the language. Are there

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:59.520
things that the Bayesian utility maximization can talk about that active inference cannot

01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:03.200
other things that active inference can talk about that Bayesian utility maximization cannot.

01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:11.360
Two short answers one short answer utility maximization must cram epistemic value into

01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:17.920
pragmatic value we gain more expressivity when we can articulate out pragmatic value which is the

01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:23.040
alignment of preferences with observations from epistemic value which is information gain so

01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:29.440
that's a huge articulation and the second thing is when you're in a anything maximization framework

01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:33.840
when you're in a utility function now again bagging the question how you constructed this

01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:38.960
function that you're trying to maximize. When you're in a maximization framework we have a well

01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:47.280
known set of approaches for finding local and global maxima using optimization or maximization

01:34:47.280 --> 01:34:54.000
frameworks. What active inference uniquely provides is it describes the path that that

01:34:54.000 --> 01:35:03.280
cognitive thing takes as a path of least action that minimizes surprise so instead of climbing

01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:08.720
to the top of the hill up are we on a foothill or are we on the biggest hill we're like a ball rolling

01:35:08.720 --> 01:35:14.320
to the bottom of the hill finding the least surprising path now that least surprising path

01:35:14.320 --> 01:35:21.280
can still include novelty and information gain but it turns out to be a lot more tractable

01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:25.840
and connected with statistical physics and quantum mechanics when we talk about the path of

01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:32.240
least action ball rolling down the hill rather than this sort of question bag on top of a mountain

01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:40.960
climbing adventure Bayesian utility approach. But it's up to each person to feel how they want to

01:35:40.960 --> 01:35:49.040
feel. Yeah it's a little bit what's in the book as well when you take the low and high road for

01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:58.960
energy principle right because how much you want to have your utility maximization function being

01:36:01.440 --> 01:36:04.720
disconnected to the pragma to do to the action.

01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:12.400
Because when you're modeling behavior it will be hard to do that independently like you have a

01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:18.800
lot of you have way more assumptions you're committing too much to a greater level of assumptions

01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:21.920
for your utility function if you don't do that.

01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:33.120
Because with the pragma with the action first that pragmatizes you have reasons to describe

01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:40.080
have reasons to believe why that information gain works the way that it does. You can leverage

01:36:40.080 --> 01:36:47.840
explanations on that without it you have a model that has more assumptions and I think if you have

01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:52.640
a model with less assumptions it's always healthier let's say so.

01:36:55.120 --> 01:37:01.200
Yeah so I think like that that that does talk about the compare compare the analysis of the

01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:08.000
expressivity but I would also say as a meta point that like I'm not happy with either of those languages

01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:15.760
I'm like I suspect that both of those languages claim certain ontological assumptions and I'm

01:37:15.760 --> 01:37:20.000
like always suspicious but wait but like where are these ontological assumptions coming from.

01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:31.280
A few other points we tap into an absolutely meaningful nexus of statistical methods and

01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:36.400
message passing schemes with active inference if you can state something in the active inference

01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:44.080
ontology and construct a generative model then message passing algorithms can be deployed that

01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:49.360
contractively compute that model so that's absolutely non-trivial otherwise it's possible

01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:56.480
just to get wrapped up in some analytical formalism but then once you want to do that on a 4k video

01:37:57.920 --> 01:38:02.880
now you're on square zero with the computer engineering this is not that way and then I

01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:09.200
will respond to your meta point with a meta point which is when we've enumerated the alternatives

01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:16.400
the one that we like best personally I feel happy with I'm also open to new alternatives arising but

01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:28.800
being unhappy when all things considered is in play why. What bothers you specifically on the ontology

01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:43.200
of the active inference. Yeah like I think like I'm still looking for I don't know what exactly

01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:47.920
I'm looking for but I'm I feel dissatisfied with the account given for why Helmholtz free energy

01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:57.520
least action thing like is the central thing here or something like why does it work like why

01:38:57.520 --> 01:39:09.200
does this principle yeah. There's a lot of funny answers I could give there that that delta that

01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:16.960
discrepancy that's curiosity and that's the space of the open and that's learning and that's your

01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:26.480
unique contribution to make and that's everything so that's not just a thorn in your shoe that's like

01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:36.480
our experience of action amidst uncertainty which is the water we're in and so whether we

01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:42.320
take a higher order narrative perspective on that discrepancy being dissatisfying

01:39:42.880 --> 01:39:48.720
or that discrepancy being satisfying I think it's pretty. I just need to minimize my surprise there

01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:52.640
yeah and you can choose to minimize your surprise through your attention

01:39:53.440 --> 01:40:01.120
you can choose to minimize surprise at a higher narrative order like I'm satisfied and complacent

01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:05.680
that I don't understand number theory but I use numbers to count objects around me

01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:10.160
so that discrepancy and understanding knowing that there's a thousand years of research

01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:17.520
that could be done on numbers it doesn't unsettle me but for someone else that might be unsettling

01:40:18.240 --> 01:40:22.480
and that might lead them to ruminate it also might lead them to do a phd and number theory

01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:30.000
so just different paths for different individuals and contexts but there's always so many technical

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:40.400
and meta levels with active huh. Okay so I don't want to like keep you guys over time but I would

01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:46.800
ask one last reference based thing which is are there active inference accounts of seeing

01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:53.760
like a state phenomena uh in any literature I think I heard you mention it once so I was like

01:40:53.760 --> 01:41:04.160
yeah like this yeah check out live stream 33 series but also this course that we're literally

01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:15.200
actually enacting in with Avel is where these accounts come to roost and where we're creating

01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:21.360
a space to develop it and it's not a cathedral for us just to spectate at today but if you

01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:27.360
want to make an active inference generative model of whatever social setting when you have the model

01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:38.560
in hand a lot of your questions will be sidestepped okay where is the 33 thing that you mentioned

01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:46.240
if you go to the page with all of our institute live streams and look in the live stream

01:41:46.240 --> 01:41:52.400
series like the paper discussions in the 33 series there's a dot zero video with background and

01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:58.320
context and then we have a dot one and a dot two conversation with the authors but Avel who's also

01:41:58.320 --> 01:42:05.920
the course coordinator for this course and kairos research like Avel's and and colleagues work has

01:42:06.560 --> 01:42:14.160
heavily built on the seeing like a state thinking like a state optimal grasp all these different

01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:23.520
topics yeah I'm yeah I'm on your youtube channel I'm slightly finding it hard to find the thing

01:42:26.160 --> 01:42:33.440
if you look up live stream 033.0 or if you go to in the video description of any video where it says

01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:38.640
all live streams here go there and search for but you'll find it and you can always email us

01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:45.840
or get in contact but yeah and I think Avel's paper like thinking like a state also can help

01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:53.520
you a lot to understand how how active inference modeling is useful for the social sciences in

01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:59.600
comparison to other types of modeling he makes an comprehensive description interesting

01:43:00.400 --> 01:43:10.080
great thanks and this is this is our first iteration on this course we are going to continue

01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:15.520
bringing new information to the table and supporting individuals who want to build

01:43:15.520 --> 01:43:22.160
generative models you know around this area whether it's part of an internship program

01:43:22.160 --> 01:43:28.560
or part of a course credit or different kinds of programs that we'll be able to develop but

01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:35.200
this is the real thing and we're able to work with people who want to think and do

01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:44.560
make sense indeed any closing thoughts on tj then I will go and then Lorena with last word

01:43:45.920 --> 01:43:49.440
um no that this was great thanks thanks for the conversation

01:43:51.280 --> 01:43:57.600
thank you well thank you for bringing tj for joining Lorena for the lecture this was a fun

01:43:58.400 --> 01:44:05.040
discussion we never really know where how it's gonna go but I'm glad that we could cover

01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:15.440
so many of these topics and probably raise more questions and footholds than door slams so thank

01:44:15.440 --> 01:44:24.160
you again Lorena yeah thank you for inviting me and I think active inference like holds a lot of

01:44:24.160 --> 01:44:30.160
space for experimenting as well some things you try to see if they make sense and they're gonna hold

01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:38.880
up and open new questions and that might be an interesting aspect of uh of the framework itself

01:44:41.840 --> 01:44:46.080
thank you everybody thank you everybody for the great live chat comments there's a lot

01:44:46.080 --> 01:44:49.600
there I couldn't read at all so till next time

01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:17.300
you
