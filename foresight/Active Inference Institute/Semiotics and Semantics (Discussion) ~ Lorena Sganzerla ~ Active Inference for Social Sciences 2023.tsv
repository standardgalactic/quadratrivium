0	14640	Hello and welcome. It is September 12, 2023. We're here in the Active Inference for the
14640	20480	Social Sciences course at the Active Inference Institute and having a discussion section
20480	28560	on semiotics and semantics here with Lorena Saganzula. We're going to be having a fun discussion,
28560	33920	I hope. If you're watching live, please feel free to write any questions in the live chat.
34640	40240	If you thought about joining and you weren't sure, it's not too late. Otherwise, we're going to
40240	48480	pick up on some key points from the lecture and on the topic and see where we go. So, Lorena,
49440	55680	welcome back and however you want to begin, let's go from there.
57360	69600	Okay. Hello. Thank you, Daniel. So, let's try to recap a little bit where we left off during the
69600	82000	lecture just to remind us where we were. My point, what I was trying to articulate was the idea of
84000	88960	what does it mean to talk about formal semantics in a way that is not really
89840	100640	loaded because it's an interesting thought to have a semantics that is actually only formal.
101360	111920	In principle, it would be relative to meaning. In the notion that
112880	128320	active inference is trying to cash it out. It's more like an idea or a way of modeling how
129840	139760	how we deal with meaningful situations. And she understands that in a more interesting,
139760	147680	more embodied and more concrete way, I was suggesting that we could use bio-semiotics as
154800	166000	as a model and as a theory for leaving creatures like language users to navigate the realm of symbols.
166240	179360	And gave one example which came from James Koch, which is the European forest
179360	185520	trade that comes with a practice. Understanding this scientific understanding of forests as a
185520	198000	practice that allows us to refer to meaningful things in the environment in terms of what is
198000	208800	valuable, what's interesting and what is not. And interestingly, what is more important also
208800	219760	from what becomes valuable, it is what is cropped out from the meaningful perspective. So things
220480	228240	nature, parts of nature becomes left out or understood as something that is not desirable.
228240	237520	And you just understand what you don't want in your articulating principle as weeds or
237520	246880	something that you should get rid of in respect to what is more desirable in terms of crops and
246880	253440	how you understand nature in a more commoditized way.
253920	266160	And I find like this example from Scott kind of very, very elucidating.
270160	276640	In the book he creates this, in the book he's talking about states, how we articulate
277360	284080	life around one specific notion of state. But in this specific example he has
284960	291280	the idea of one official observer and this official observer establishes a principle of
292160	300880	meaning in a way you have to have a handle of nature and that also articulates how
301120	311120	villages and how practices around agriculture and how people relate to each other within these
311120	324560	practices gets organized. Specifically for one interesting point that he makes that is to appreciate
324720	331920	to appreciate the constriction of that is like a vision that notices not
331920	337920	what within the meaningful crops but which is left outside the field of vision.
341200	345440	And I bring that specifically to understand how
346400	355440	the free-knit principle can or could be connected to a generalized synchronization
356480	363200	over time in relation to those symbols and those practices in terms of niche construction and
365840	372880	how those, how this niche construction brings along with the symbolic
373840	378640	use of our language, our predictive value.
386480	391200	Thank you. Bryn, do you want to bring up any thoughts on that or any other
392320	394320	pieces or I'm happy to add a comment.
402960	422560	Okay, guess not. A lot to say there. There was a little bit of a double play with what is cropped.
422560	434560	On one hand what is cropped is the industrial crop that is being prepared and then the other
434560	440640	side of that coin is what is cropped out and what we crop in is the part that we're paying
440640	447440	attention to and we can't pay attention to everything so it's like two sides of the same coin
447440	453120	what we pay attention to what we include in attention in our cognitive awareness
453920	462240	leaves the shadow which is what we exclude and that could be like the weeds or the other ecosystem
462240	469200	services so by highlighting the meaning or one dimension of meaning or one stance on meaning
469520	476880	that only it's like a seesaw that becomes salient to the extent that something else
477840	483760	must be deprioritized so that's how we accentuate these distributions of meaning
484560	490800	and what do we get from active inference and and free energy principle beyond for example
490800	496400	what's provided and seeing like a state. I think there's a lot we could say on that but
497120	506560	one piece is we get a process theory a real procedural approach to how different systems
507200	514160	come to do sense making and cognition and action so just describing the lay of the land
514720	522880	or the history of forestry in Europe or any other state of affairs in the world
523120	528080	merely describing it may not even help us determine what's going to happen
528800	535120	a short time later let alone a long time later or what might happen in a very different ecology
535840	541520	whereas if we understand the processes of sense making and decision making that different kinds
541520	547840	of cognitive agents do certainly humans also those states as cognitive entities which is
547840	553840	what seeing like a state or thinking like a state entails we get a process-based view
554880	561520	on what otherwise might be merely descriptive and along with that process-based view we gain
561520	567680	an increased ability to make unique explanations predictions accounts and so on.
568320	581680	Yeah we can we can also understand it in a different perspective in terms of
582240	588800	realizing what becomes sensitized and what becomes desensitized
590080	596880	along the process so you can you can possibly model that using this kind of tools and understanding
596880	602720	how that happens over time right I don't know how how much in terms of prediction
603920	610080	of things that we're not foreseeing in these descriptions we can we can achieve in fact
610960	617840	you can achieve some some level for sure but like that system should be this side how
619120	625120	how that delivers a very all-encompassing prediction in this kind in these cases they
625120	635920	don't believe it can right I don't think that's the purpose as well but we can at least have
637280	643360	which is might not be as positive as we want but I think we can understand how
645440	651200	we can gain some understanding in this process of being more sensitive or less sensitive to specific
651680	662160	primes and how this organizational principles how powerful they become over time
666080	672320	yeah I'll read some comments in the chat and then Lorena or Brent feel free to just give
672320	680640	any thoughts just upcycle club wrote hello biomimicry can enhance biosemiotics by showing
680640	687200	us how nature solves problems and creates beauty through signs and codes and by encouraging us
687200	698000	to apply these principles to our own creations yeah the idea of coding is an interesting idea
698000	705440	but to talk about codes I don't think we can that's my take right I don't understand
705440	715120	like you have we haven't coded any type of principles within our cognitive ability but
717680	724960	biologically speaking however you can understand these encodings in terms of becoming more or less
725040	734560	sensitive over time to environmental cues as the example in terms of I use the example of
734560	746240	forestry right so in that specific case this what becomes more what you become more sensitive and
746240	752080	the more you organize your life or the social life is organized around specific principles
752080	762000	then you can make sense of these relational stories instead of just leveraging one full
765520	772960	difficult to explain notion of encoding in terms of social cognition because it will be hard to
772960	779920	explain how the brain will be encoding these specific symbols but they can be cashed out
780000	784800	in the environment relationally in terms of those organizational principles
786560	794800	and then you have this idea of biomimicry like this reiterations and how that comes along with
798160	801600	to explain what this mimic or this mean will be then
802560	805440	of it's not so so straightforward they think
807760	815520	well certainly decompiling the source code of nature is somewhere between challenging and
815520	823680	misguided or impossible but that notion of a code script for biology has animated discussions of
823680	829440	life going back to for example Schrodinger's what is life he basically says there's two
829440	836800	aspects of living systems there's their organizational capacity their negentropic capacity
837360	844800	and then there's their code script their aperiodic crystalline informational repository
845360	853360	and then another place that coding comes up a little bit less in the source code space is
853360	860880	predictive coding and that's in a way highly compatible with active inference and gives a
860880	867520	deflationary account on how the semiotics are encoded rather than saying well this is what this
867520	873680	variable in the source code means or this is what this codes for or here's a code switch
874560	881600	predictive coding is like saying we're not even going to touch the semantics of what the sign is
881600	889040	itself we're just going to hypothesize that the way that information about the sign is transferred
889760	896400	is through this maximum information signaling approach called predictive coding because predictive
896400	905040	coding arose out of video compression algorithms and only at the end of the 90s was found to be
905040	911360	increasingly relevant for neural circuitry and so on so it's another example of where like a process
911360	927840	based approach ends up deflating or reframing the otherwise semantically loaded question
929440	933920	it's like switching out the question of like where we're going to be with how we're going to get there
934880	939520	and instead of only focusing on the meaning of the signs first off as if the meaning of the
939520	945600	signs could be discussed outside of their implementation and then even if we could figure
945600	950720	out what the signs were we would then just turn around and want to know how they were transmitted
951520	957120	and so predictive coding or predictive processing in a way short circuits that or
957120	964720	inverse it by first looking to explain how information is transmitted that could support
965680	972560	semiotics and then in the context of biological systems we naturally have biosemiotics
976640	982640	yeah i would ask the question when you talk about information being transmitted right what that
982640	988160	actually means and i think that's a very very big topic and a very large discussion in terms of
988960	999120	uh information information theory when specifically applying that into biological systems i think
999120	1004480	there are some interesting people working on information that makes the case that Shannon has
1004480	1012160	a point and he's really interested not in the semantics or in the meaning or anything else it's
1012240	1017040	kind of interested in the problem of transmission and when you talk about transmission
1019040	1026800	it's worth to ask what is being transmitted exactly in the terms of of signals even if you're
1026800	1032560	capturing specific patterns and you think that the pattern is this thing that will be transmitted
1033200	1036080	in that sense but that would be a worth
1039920	1048240	a worth asking question to understand like the this notion of what is actually being
1048800	1054240	transmitted in that sense like the information probably this information theory is focusing
1054240	1060080	on this notion of the problem of transmission and then all the the concepts that come along to
1060080	1067840	explain that in terms of uncertainty or noise and everything that uh impacts this transmission
1067840	1077600	of processes and if you're saying like we're transmitting information in these things that
1077600	1085840	is breaking this semantic code apart yes it is because like the problem is not focused on that
1085840	1093520	it's that focusing on the specific correlations that we have that we call it we're mentioning
1093520	1101840	as information and how these correlations are an issue from from the cat go from what is being
1101840	1108880	picked up in one side being correlated to what comes into the other side right how that how do
1108880	1117440	you lose or gain more information in that but the deeper question here is
1120160	1125360	how can you say that you are actually gaining or losing that information because you are defining
1125360	1131120	this correlation that could be transmitted or not from the cat go if you don't have that
1132080	1135680	you don't have anything being actually actually communicated
1138080	1144960	so with that in mind you can explain these concepts in terms of function and then there's
1144960	1156080	a bunch of theories that navigate this sense of uh signaling that is specifically only functional
1156160	1158320	and then predictive coding tries to
1162080	1169200	try tries to push that a little further maybe but then you have to explain in
1171120	1175840	in a deep sense how this information is being actually transmitted and processed and I don't
1175840	1180400	think that is really really as obvious and as clear as we think it is
1181040	1187360	specifically when we're talking about this biological
1188880	1193280	way of nature navigating this process this this signaling
1195520	1201600	we have to talk about because the correlation if it's defined are being issued like from the
1201600	1208480	beginning you can only have this kind of transmission for someone specific that can
1208480	1211520	be able to understand that in the other side right
1215520	1223200	well certainly whether we're talking about a chemical pheromone that requires some type
1223200	1231280	of receptor or something more ephemeral like language that requires more of a semantic reference
1231360	1239120	frame there's no receiving the message without the sender it's like they're kind of the two
1239120	1248720	sides of the phone call um I'll ask a question from the chat love evolve how about cultural
1248720	1256240	encoding and principles in contrast to organizational so how do we think about
1256240	1265760	cultural meaning and is and is that similar or different than organizational
1268560	1274320	yeah that's that's a good point right I think if you take very seriously the example from
1275760	1285440	the forestry is a practice then I think it has to be organizational in that sense the meaning
1286320	1292960	navigates this organizational practice this organizational story that
1295040	1303440	that impacts not only communication between agents but also how
1305520	1312960	how the environment will be interpreted so and in this sense it will be transmitted
1312960	1318240	and repeated over time because it has a history you cannot ignore like the history of this
1318800	1325040	practices being pushed further and replicated through generations right so
1330240	1332080	the way like the villages will be
1334480	1339840	organized in terms of that specific practice for instance can be understood in a meaningful
1339840	1346320	and cultural way that organizes life in virtue of
1349040	1358000	some specific principles that sensitizes our agents towards specific directions
1360640	1361120	and I think
1370800	1378960	I don't I don't forget my point for instance you can talk about
1385440	1392320	if you think about archaeological findings and how archaeological
1393040	1400720	so descriptions of specific villages and how they navigate this mapping out this
1403120	1412400	this archaeological sites they usually know exactly if you have some kind of history already
1412400	1418160	from this this communities how this how that city will be likely to be organized
1418880	1424720	first off like where is the water and if the water is in certain directions probably
1425600	1432400	there will be certain kinds of relationships with housing and communal housings and where
1432400	1439200	are they going to place their dead in relation to this kind of specific organization principle
1439200	1446800	the water is here so plantations will be not so far away from that and this city organizes
1446880	1453440	like the village organized a little bit in this sense and that builds up cultural practices
1454160	1456880	at least archaeologically can be explained as such
1460000	1470080	I thought of something similar organization being the logistical or the operational structural
1470640	1478320	aspects so those would be the roads that connect the forestry outposts or the circulatory system
1478320	1486960	that connects the different organs of organization and then the culture is a cause and a consequence
1487600	1494960	of organization organization is the enabling conditions for culture to arise okay so given
1494960	1502960	this road network what cultures arise how similar or different are they convergently what are their
1503840	1507840	practices or their narratives that are shared amongst these different outposts
1508880	1515680	or in the bodily example okay given the organization of the organs literally the organizing
1516320	1524240	process or principle then what biosemiotics can arise with glucose and insulin and glucagon
1525120	1532560	and what culturally can arise maybe even in terms of the generative model of encultured
1533120	1538640	agents as a function of organization and then what are those encultured agents do
1540320	1545520	to the extent that they can modify organization and so these kinds of
1545920	1555360	um unrolling cause and consequence relationships can be hard to disentangle
1556160	1566000	because there's not like a clean single starting point that can be separated out or because it
1566000	1575360	unfolds historically it's not exactly a reaction in a test tube
1577280	1584240	so how does active inference give us an entry point into thinking about this
1586240	1590320	yeah that's one interesting thing about active inference that you
1591040	1597760	you don't really need one uh you don't really need an origin point right you can
1598400	1604560	start start modeling you start understanding that at any any given point and build up from
1604560	1613760	from that story and see how it unfolds over time i think that's the most beautiful idea that you
1613760	1619520	you define your parameters and then you see from that parameter that can be arbitrarily defined and
1619600	1627280	you can navigate how things change within those parameters in the generative model right when
1627280	1633600	you when you have your like dynamical systems for instance you have your state space they have
1633600	1643680	some specific range of defining parameters that set the limits of the possible states that you're
1643680	1653600	going to navigate and if you use this notion that this two densities brings about in terms of
1653600	1661680	Bayesian modeling you can use these these kinds of tools to understand how from that specific
1661680	1671760	parameters update why what we narrate in active inference as if belief updating can change over
1671760	1682880	time in these terms that's a very nice point it reminds me of Bruno Latour's actor network theory
1682880	1689600	or ants which kind of advocates a similar approach to what you describe which is like enter anywhere
1689600	1699440	open-mindedly because in an iterated modeling or iterated analysis setting the first proposal
1699440	1706320	or the first trace detected we know that's not the whole picture there may not be a whole or only
1706320	1712320	picture so we need to enter and iterate and then with active inference specifically because of the
1712320	1718560	compositionality that we get within a layer collective behavior and then also the kind of
1718560	1728480	nesting smaller things inside of bigger things we can always build something and then we can go oh
1728480	1734880	wow it's like there's a lot of top-down influence maybe there's a higher order factor or slower
1734880	1743360	factor or a contextual factor we should consider or oh we were abstracting across these smaller
1743360	1756480	things inside but for a later day or if relevance we can dive in and so then it allows a light hold
1756480	1764320	or a grasp on the proposed generative model obviously it's map not territory but even
1764320	1772800	beyond that we always know that we can expand laterally and across scales starting from anywhere
1774480	1785280	in an iterated modeling process without our first or even 11th model being proposed as like
1785280	1792160	the accounts of some complex cultural phenomena which we're always going to only ever have our
1792160	1799920	own perspectives on yeah I think you don't really find that you being so oh all in copas
1799920	1806400	saying like you have one model that will model them all you can you you can navigate those models
1806400	1813040	in these more more instrumental terms it raises different questions when you put things like that
1813040	1820320	in terms of the ontology of models and models and theories and sciences but you they can be also
1820320	1830720	described as tools for describe tools for yeah tools for for grasping and describing
1831680	1837120	phenomena in a more non-committal way
1840160	1849040	how much that how much that smuggles in philosophical or more ontological problems
1849120	1854800	it's still I think under like debate but it is still
1857040	1865040	it's still uh it is still a tool to bring insights to think about specific cultural
1866160	1874480	collective uh phenomena which is not it's it's complicated to because I think what I'm getting
1874480	1879280	at I'm kind of like going back and forth but when you talk about social sciences and modeling
1879280	1886880	usually you have like ways of modeling agents or ways of modeling collectives and active inference
1886880	1894640	is trying to to come up with a a modeling in which you can understand agency and collectives
1894640	1902480	within the same modeling uh schema and I think the specific specifically for these
1902480	1910400	cases if you're interested in understanding uh types of cultural phenomena among language users
1910400	1920080	in uh in specific contexts you can at least partially understand or have or gain some insight
1920080	1927120	in this agent-collective relationship that that is a little bit more interesting than
1927280	1935040	we have found so far in the social sciences because you can have like or specific understandings of
1935040	1941680	means but then how the agent where is the agency in that you you lose a little bit of agency
1942720	1950400	well when you're trying to understand uh only agents then you don't know how that
1950400	1960400	kind of scales up because active inference tries and offers this scale free uh modeling tools
1961040	1969840	that facilitates this this um conversion into agents agents and uh collectives
1971360	1979040	I would be interested in asking you actually how how do you navigate that when you talk about
1979280	1983360	social phenomena in ants or termites or
1987920	1997280	because then yeah you have very specific coding demarcations I guess for for this uh
1998560	1999520	social environments
1999520	2014400	yeah it's a great question it's also whether it's a uh open wounds or a dirty closet that's just
2014400	2023360	shut there's actually a lot of ambiguity and unresolved tension around well is the ant colony
2023360	2030880	social are they social insects that reifies the nest mate as the individual and then what
2030880	2036880	they're doing is like when we hang out and talk so reifying the nest mate as individual makes
2036880	2044080	the colony social but if the colony is individual then what nest mates are doing with each other
2044080	2049520	is not social anymore than we would describe the liver and the kidney as having like a social
2049520	2055520	single cellular interaction but we know that would be missing the point and so there definitely is
2055520	2063040	attention with some of these evolutionary lineages like ants being monophiletically
2063040	2071120	obligate you social all and only ants are you social they all live in the colonies there's no
2071840	2078320	free living nest mate whereas other parts of the evolutionary tree there are
2079760	2086240	life histories that do look a little bit more like social collaboration that can then
2086960	2096320	dissolve and so knowing what level of lock in makes something social
2096560	2104800	when are we socializing and what level of lock in goes beyond social and it kind of like makes
2104800	2114640	when the blanket is so strong around the social that like for multi-cellularity that it it's kind
2114640	2122400	of losing the social feature again because if we just use social to mean the connective tissue
2122400	2134480	or the kind of lubricant or the spaces between everything then it means nothing so a real attention
2134480	2146080	is what space does the social account for and is this going to be a concept with a lot of creep
2146240	2152960	looking well it's a social relationship between the roots of the tree and the fungus and it's a
2152960	2159360	social relationship amongst the molecules in the test tube is that too broad of a social conception
2161200	2168720	are there downsides or are there trade-offs associated with a broader social concept
2168800	2174400	social concept do we dilute what the social means and then on the other side
2175600	2182480	might we exclude phenomena that could importantly be considered social
2184080	2188880	well that's not social they're just talking on a train it's like well that's the other side
2188880	2195920	if we were to have carving out encounters that we do want to include as social and
2195920	2206480	and is there a true social does active inference help us sidestep or at least negotiate this territory
2208240	2214880	because we could develop a generative model or an ecosystem of shared intelligence with
2215600	2225360	one person and two internet of things devices and a bird and a metronome and just say we made
2225360	2235520	what we made and then leave it as a second-order interpretation whether that is a social setting
2239440	2246000	I mean I think you you are pointing at like how I think granularity of those scales right
2246000	2250480	if you have a model that I want you want to everything that you already have it's probably
2250480	2257760	not interesting and not informative because you cannot like define those limits of what you're
2257760	2264320	trying to understand and in the other hand when you do that when you define those limits if you're
2264320	2271680	too narrow or you're gonna leave out you're gonna idealize also in a way right and leave out many
2271680	2279280	other parts of the system that you're interested in but if you don't do that if you don't
2282080	2287360	if you don't make this if you don't make this decision when modeling you think then how
2289120	2299040	how you can have any access to the phenomena right and and to connect this to the forestry
2299040	2309680	so in the forestry example the disirata was lumber now that may have been a very narrowly scoped
2310640	2318320	desire but it's it's a relevant thing to to want this resource and then industrialization
2318880	2327760	science as a process professionalization those allow the description and and the handling and
2327760	2334560	ultimately the kind of top-down legibility and control thinking like a forestry company now
2335360	2342240	with respect to the social sciences by analogy to forestry science so now we're entering an
2342240	2352800	era of increased legibility and control of social systems and human natural capital and
2352800	2362800	attention as a resource trust as a resource in a way is being cropped analogous to produce the
2362800	2370960	content of lumber but now there are social content so as the social goes from being just
2371840	2378880	only simply the water we swim in not something that's even compared counterfactually to alternative
2379840	2389360	cultural possibilities per se but falls under the scope of the professional management like
2389360	2396720	forestry then that's when this discussion of well what's the lumber and what is the weeds that are
2396720	2406640	being pruned and what ecosystem services when we pay attention to certain parts of human social
2406720	2416880	culture and when we seek to make more of this kind of lumber what else does that come along with
2418560	2426720	and what decisions come into play and that comes along when you see
2436800	2438320	you
2458240	2462560	or instagram i don't know twitter after what happened to twitter but
2467360	2476080	but yeah the in terms of attention pruning you do have that very effectively already happening
2476080	2484800	already you can see how that happens if efficiently in the world in elections for instance it can be
2484800	2492160	very very easily manipulated and we saw what happened in elections for instance in brazil or in
2492160	2506720	the u.s and well all over you navigate a system of attention organization that
2507680	2512160	selects in only what he thinks that you're interested in
2515040	2520640	in the effects of that in terms of decision making and in terms of trust in terms of
2522480	2529680	diversity of discourse we have seen that it can be devastating
2531760	2537600	so the and the question would be like how can you make this a little bit how can you use active
2537600	2545440	inference and these tools that we have to make this kind of technology a little bit more inclusive
2545440	2550400	without being super also disruptive is it even like
2556640	2561680	a possibility i really don't know i think it's an ethical problem that we have when we talk about
2561680	2567440	social systems and these principles of attention exclusion leaving things out
2576400	2585440	lot to say on that um with modeling and interpolating and models whether it's large
2585440	2596000	language model type or linear regression type it is able to interpolate to put data points within
2597680	2605040	an enclosure of what has already been described and Bayesian statistics and other types of
2605040	2611760	prediction algorithms are not immune to that either if we have some prior distribution belief
2612640	2617760	um we believe it's possible for it to be between 20 and 30 degrees outside
2619520	2627440	then when we get data inside of our bounds we can converge and that actually
2627440	2633680	tightens our beliefs not always a bad thing of course and then outside of the scope of the
2633680	2640080	possible those data are just seen as noise and they may not even be integrated so then that
2640080	2648000	can lead to a reinforcing process not necessarily an adaptive one either where information that's
2648000	2655040	confirmatory is used to ratchet and increase precision and then information that is not
2655040	2659200	confirmatory is discarded as not useful
2659440	2669840	it doesn't yeah in this case is yeah it doesn't even enter the uh the landscape
2671360	2673280	of attention of the user in
2679040	2685520	what i what i'm what i was thinking in relation to this no this idea of
2685520	2697120	uh a forestry is because we have now organizational principles that are faster and
2700880	2710400	more populated with uh information and attention grabbing kinds of prompts
2710400	2714400	we transformed the same
2720800	2723200	we just from the same principle into
2731680	2739200	a harder to grasp process it's it's hard it becomes more complex it becomes harder to
2740000	2747040	describe this the process of understanding that in terms of forestry is kind of way more grounded
2747680	2754800	when you apply that socially to this kind of environment that we're talking like internet or
2754880	2759760	is highly uh volatile
2764240	2771280	and virtual in principle in environment it becomes much harder to assess what is being
2771280	2775360	pruned out or not you just don't know it makes it more clear that
2777680	2782160	there is a process of pruning you need to have no control of what is being taken out
2783120	2789760	you have no idea what's being like left away from your perspective of attention
2792800	2801760	so to this topic of intended or unintended semantic pruning i think um this has helped me
2802320	2808640	identify attention if we want to talk about the semantics or semiotics biosemionics whatever we
2808640	2818960	want to call it of the letter e in relationship to letter a we're looking for an account that might
2818960	2827600	convey letterness but we're generalized above enus or anus so in some ways we've erased or
2827600	2838320	abstracted generalized away from the particulars of the sign's meaning by taking a semiotic
2838320	2848960	perspective and so it's like we got into the game to have a semantic account of biological
2848960	2863360	phenomena or of any phenomena for biological entity yet this process in a sense distances us
2863360	2871360	from the particulars that actually do grant it that meaning in the actuality like if we
2871360	2877440	walk into a sacred space and it's like oh well that is just doing that over there and this
2877440	2882560	architecture is doing this and because of the layout people must use the room this way
2883520	2897440	that's removed from the actual meaning which is the cause and consequence with the organization and
2897440	2909840	culture that we discussed but that prima facia account doesn't generalize get any generalization
2909840	2915920	that we make so that we can talk about multiple places or multiple letters on a common
2916560	2920640	accounting framework is going to remove those particularities
2923840	2929040	so it's a very challenging catch 22 whether we want to really
2930400	2938480	account for the n equals one and maybe even live and act and play and work in the n equals one
2938480	2945680	versus develop something that might be satisfying and cut and dry but it's always going to be on
2945680	2955920	the sidelines with respect to what it actually means but what do you mean like is i don't understand
2955920	2961600	what you what you're getting at like is it you mean like it's generalized or not generalized
2962160	2968240	i didn't get that like when we have a general when we generalize when we
2970240	2976240	ask what words mean what what words mean beyond any given word we've lost touch with
2976240	2984720	what any given word means but words are what they actually mean in a situation
2985360	2993600	so it's just in this scientific approach to meaning semiotics and semantics
2998000	3006400	we have these two tensions or a tension to reconcile between actually giving an account
3006400	3010320	of the meaningfulness of the specific thing
3012880	3016080	versus taking a more scientific approach which would be
3017360	3023360	gathering a group of similar things and finding their shared attributes
3025200	3028640	which out of necessity must abstract must crop out
3029440	3041440	features that are are empirically or anecdotally taken to not matter like we abstract whether it
3041440	3046960	was a monday or tuesday that we did the experiments we just combine all of our replicates together
3046960	3048560	when we do the scientific analysis
3048640	3057280	you mean you mean if you generalize the practice you lose
3058560	3063280	what you're being if you generalize it too much you lose everything that's meaningful to it in
3063280	3071440	terms of like for you formalize it and then you have no yeah you have an empty semantics you
3071440	3076960	have a semantics with no meaning that can only be meaningful in terms of how you apply that in
3077040	3082320	terms of specific practices yeah it's like i i have a framework for you know the formal meaning
3082320	3088000	of letters within words within sentences within paragraphs and then it's like well but now what's
3088000	3095600	your next n equals one word that you're actually going to bring it's not just about building some
3095600	3101440	abstract scaffold yeah for bigger and bigger boulders of meaning
3102400	3106240	at some point through our embodied thought and action
3108480	3111760	in our experience it is going to come down into the particulars
3113440	3118000	and it doesn't immediately seem clear that simply generalizing further
3121040	3121920	brings us there
3123920	3130800	yeah yeah particularly i don't really believe you can have that kind of generalization i think
3131680	3140080	we attempt to build whatever what i see that's the interesting aspect of the formal semantics
3140080	3142400	you try to build this more general
3146000	3153520	understanding that's just formalizes to model but for that to be meaningful it has to be embedded
3153520	3160560	in a way of practicing it like in a forestry practice you have to be embedded in a cultural
3160560	3168720	environment in which that can be actually uh observed in terms of what happens when
3169520	3172800	a generative model is being updated or not
3175600	3180320	is that what you mean because otherwise i don't really understand how it becomes too
3182160	3189840	yeah it becomes too formal it becomes too abstract in terms of some i would not understand
3189840	3192640	what that is
3195600	3203680	i'll i'll think of a little more um brand or tj do you want to add any thoughts or questions
3206080	3211520	yeah sorry i i think like i don't have a lot of context i've been like following some of the
3211520	3221760	discussion but not attended a lot of these calls i'm like it's all yeah yeah um yeah i didn't know
3221760	3229360	i think um yeah i'm in general just sort of interested in trying to understand the relationship
3229360	3239920	between um yeah like sorts of like constructionist epistemologies and um yeah like generative models
3239920	3248160	and active inference style stuff and um how active inference style like yeah what are the
3248160	3253520	philosophical commitments that active inference involves with respect to knowledge and epistemology
3253520	3260400	and there's a sense in which like rational choice models often assume a certain sort of like
3262160	3266960	objectivity to beliefs and then desires are where most of the degrees of freedom lie or something
3267520	3272480	um whereas there's a lot of like issue like there's a lot of things that come up once you
3272480	3278400	start talking about reflexivities where concepts themselves become self-fulfilling prophecies
3279360	3284960	what you believe about what your beliefs about society and shaping the society itself so there's
3284960	3290240	the sense in which there's a score dependence between the object of knowledge and knowledge about
3290240	3296720	that object itself and i think yeah like i'm sort of interested in like how the active
3296720	3302960	entrance ways of thinking about this offers what perspectives on those questions and stuff like
3302960	3315840	that um yeah thank you great questions yeah so when you talk about the uh object of knowledge
3315840	3321760	and knowledge itself and active inference uh
3328320	3334080	i think you you you can think of in terms of this
3338240	3340960	well there's a few ways to think about that i guess
3341360	3350640	uh the knowledge itself it has to come epistemically from where your agent
3350640	3356560	is actually embedded and situated in specifically an active inference it's embodied
3357280	3364960	it kind of needs to have a model the model is modeling a body is modeling a body that is in
3364960	3372400	the world and it's all the time uh situated is never disconnected to its environment and it's
3372400	3382720	history and how the history of that environment right yeah uh but if you think if you push that
3382720	3388080	to the object of that knowledge uh i don't know how how different
3392240	3392800	that will
3395600	3401280	how different how can you differ differentiate that so sharply when you talk about active inference
3401920	3403440	because
3405920	3416640	if you think of uh in terms of a generative model then what will be updated comes is updated from
3416640	3428720	a prior that is always directed in this body in this situated realm so they sort of conflated
3428800	3436240	as i see maybe a maybe a mistaken but they sort of correlate in how you're gonna update your
3436240	3444480	generative model which it will be at the same time in at the same time what you know and what you
3444480	3452400	the object of this knowledge still i sorry if i can just like uh raise a question to that
3452400	3457520	yeah so i think like i think that there is a sense in which like with respect to
3458400	3463440	something that in epistemology we call self knowledge there is there is a question here
3463440	3472240	that the the active inference agent has this model of that is like situated in the body or like in
3472240	3481040	in its like um like structure and is also modeling that structure itself and there is like this issue
3481040	3487840	of like where where yeah like the belief is not unidirectionally dependent on the object
3487840	3493680	sort of a thing but has this feedback loop thing comes up there but there's another way in which
3493680	3500000	i think like uh where this sort of thing comes where even if the object is outside of the body
3500800	3507760	of the knowledge i think that that could still come up so for instance if i live in it if an
3507760	3514720	active inference agent lives in a society of other active inference agents where currently all of them
3514720	3522080	defect on prisoner's dilemma but maybe like on further reflection they would want to like again
3522080	3525920	like i don't know what further reflection would mean in the active inference sense but i'm like just
3525920	3533040	saying in the intuitive sense like that what would it mean for them to like go from one fixed point
3533120	3537760	to another fixed point where they're all cooperating or or or something like that and
3538720	3544640	that that i think is not clear to me like how that shift can happen in active inference where
3545440	3554400	it's not just purely using the empirical information to keep running the the the middle of the of your
3555360	3565120	like free energy equation but also recognizing the contingencies and then identifying those
3565120	3573120	contingencies to make something like shifts from one state to another like if if i model that the
3573120	3578400	society is a cruel space and if everyone models the society is a cruel space then we will end up
3578400	3584240	creating a society that is a cruel space but if only we could recognize that our belief or our
3584240	3591120	model that society is a cool space is a contingent belief and we could all somehow negotiate or
3591680	3598320	communicate and shift to a different belief about what society is and society is a kind
3598320	3606560	place then we will end up creating that kinder society or something and that sort of like a
3606560	3612880	belief about the thing that society is it's not entirely within the agent like it's sort of
3613840	3619600	it it has a weird intersubjective character so it's not entirely outside of the agent either
3619600	3628960	but it's not entirely like internal to the agent either or something yeah yeah you can think of
3628960	3634560	that like you're talking about active inference action comes first right you have to you don't
3634560	3641520	have the knowledge like inside your head waiting for you to to push that out of the way action has
3641520	3650240	to come first so if you if you take that as a principle an organizing principle it depends on
3650240	3658000	the contingency of your actions the possibilities might be limited by your situated um condition
3658000	3664720	but they are limited it doesn't mean that you don't have like a range of options from that state
3664720	3671360	space in which you can go you can navigate so you can navigate it for the good or for the bad
3671920	3677520	but it starts with the the action perception loop it starts with the action
3680080	3688880	a lot of few other pieces on that teach a very good point like when we see the pragmatic component
3688880	3696400	of action as self-fulfilling epistemic component of action having to do with gaining knowledge and
3696400	3700880	the salience of information but the pragmatic component is about bringing our observations
3700880	3707600	into alignment with our preferences and then you identified two related settings one of them is like
3708160	3717440	pure intra subjectivity like I expect myself or I find myself or I habitually think about x well
3717440	3723520	that's kind of a trivial self-fulfillment because thinking about something is its own
3723520	3732800	fulfillment and then when we're in this second person or social space we can agree on little
3732800	3740960	performance art or on a game and games give evidence to that that when people are able to
3741040	3748640	perform communication or message passing such that new expectations or preferences are set
3749680	3755840	whether more top down like more seeing like a state or more laterally more like collective
3755840	3762640	behavior then those regimes can be embodied and then you brought up a very important point about
3762640	3767840	the awareness of the contingencies or where awareness is of adjacent possibles or of counter
3767840	3777040	factuals so the body might be we could model its morphology as doing some computation but that
3777040	3782080	doesn't mean that the the morphology has an awareness or can explore a counterfactual
3783040	3790560	like bodies are not always exploring every counterfactual because skin is in the game
3790560	3798880	but again mentally it's very cheap and easy to consider counterfactuals and situational awareness
3798880	3806640	of social settings especially if it can be not understood but communicated opens up a space
3806640	3812080	where we're all playing prisoner's dilemma now there's parameterizations of prisoners multi-agent
3812080	3819600	prisoner's dilemma where tragically we just all defect all day and never learn there's also
3819600	3825920	parameterizations where you just start all cooperating and never defect and then the interesting
3825920	3832400	settings are where there might be like phase transitions or where perturbation moves the
3832400	3842000	system from one attractor into another attractor so there's just a lot of richness and that's the
3842000	3850480	work of building generative models in that iterated modeling process to unpack and refine
3851920	3858000	and active inference isn't going to have a stance on the prisoner's dilemma we can use
3858000	3862560	active inference to to describe the prisoner's dilemma but active inference isn't going to come
3862560	3869440	down on on literally even a little two by two game theory matrix so we can then extrapolate that
3869440	3875280	active inference is not going to come down with an opinion on something significantly
3876960	3890960	more rich and real than a two by two game theory matrix and so that work is what people enact in
3890960	3902400	applying active inference right and i think like my question is something like but insofar as like
3903360	3913200	humans try to constantly improve their social games how can we model that sort of a prior
3913200	3918720	or your actions or policies that enables that sort of like progressive
3922080	3925520	improvements or something well
3928160	3933280	you can we are assuming that we're trying to improve right we we don't know that but you
3933280	3942080	can model them as improving but like following Daniel's lead we're talking about these specific
3942080	3947280	games and contingencies they they did these these transitions from one state to another
3948320	3953760	specifically if you're talking about this modeling of social actors and talking about
3953760	3959360	several actors if you're modeling several of them will not be really linear right you don't
3959360	3970080	have like a easy smooth transition of improvement you can capture over time as modeling how they
3970640	3977520	might tend to go towards a direction and understand that as improvement but that takes
3979760	3985360	specific iterations that will not be fully linear i guess specifically if you want to
3985360	3993520	understand error and improvement instead of try an error but try and adding up into this
3994080	4001760	error like error improvement but when you're modeling specifically with dynamical systems
4001760	4006400	for instance you you you're not going to see a full linear story and i don't think you're
4006400	4013680	going to see that uh if you're modeling using active inference and multiple agents agents
4013680	4025040	i'll add one piece there so how can we go about modeling multi-scale social goals so
4026720	4035760	we could think about you know different citizens in a region and they the modeler is going to
4035760	4044800	choose what knowledge to realize in the generative model like what you put into the calculator it's
4044800	4056080	going to calculate upon now this happens to be a elaborate stochastic method but if we only tell
4056080	4061360	people yeah there's just your personal income optimized for that your preference is to have
4061360	4067200	that be higher well then the simulation is going to unfold a certain way if we say well there's
4067200	4074960	your personal financial income and then there's your city and then there's your region then that
4074960	4084000	opens up through through different mechanisms you know maybe an individual goes flat or neutral
4084000	4091600	on the personal in service of a larger win at a higher level well now what if the modeler says
4091600	4095760	it's not just about the financial income now we're also going to have this secondary criterion
4096560	4103600	well now different agents could attend differently to those two different outcome variables
4104720	4110640	and maybe there's one simulation where 50 only care about this and 50 care about that and it
4110640	4122240	works perfect or it doesn't work it's like a broad surveying you know or lego set or or grammar
4122880	4136080	or or active inference ontology for scoping very broadly and very inclusively but all the work is
4136080	4149280	in the real simulation developments and sweeping because very little could be said about a game
4149280	4155600	theory game if you didn't know what the parameters were in the matrix you wouldn't know whether this
4155600	4160880	prisoner's dilemma was going to be like an always cooperate or which agents with which strategies
4160880	4168000	would or wouldn't cooperate if you don't know what the matrix looks like so before the values have
4168000	4175920	kind of been filled in it's just like actually describing the adjacencies and the counterfactuals
4175920	4184720	and the contingencies of our scientific model but that's still prior to having the model in hand
4185680	4190160	and the model you know so now we're looking at that tree in the european forest
4191040	4194480	and it's like well if i had this tool then i could cut it down this way if i had this tool
4194480	4203520	i could cut it down this way or i could wait it's like that's alternative actions about that tree
4204400	4209920	now in the social science setting discussion of different scientific methodologies are like
4210640	4214240	counterfactuals about that social tree
4226720	4233440	yeah and specifically if you're navigating these kinds of game theoretical models if that's what
4233440	4240160	you're interested in you can even define in terms of prisoner's dilemma for instance
4242160	4252960	specific values just see what happens when everybody deflects and in how frequent
4253920	4260960	modulate those frequencies in terms of specific in multiple iterations how
4261920	4271680	how how are you gonna build up the weight or the tendency of deflecting again if your neighbor
4272240	4280080	deflected once and deflected twice or three times or and see how that will accommodate
4281920	4288160	over time how many times this agent will change its behavior until it stops changing the behavior
4288640	4291120	but that you don't really
4295520	4301120	that's that that again you use you might use a bayesian understanding a bayesian model for that
4301120	4304000	but it not necessarily explain
4304000	4309840	me
4310960	4319520	he does not necessarily explain the action fully i mean social you just you're modeling only the
4319520	4331120	interest of that specific actor i have a slightly meta question if i can ask both of you i'm not
4331120	4338080	sure how these calls usually go i'm curious what are your interests in active inference what do you
4338080	4343280	think like what brings you to active inference and like what do you think what do you think active
4343280	4350960	inference adds to our theoretical understanding and in what ways or something the right now go for it
4351680	4354240	well
4356560	4364240	i think i was trying to touch upon that before and how we can if you're navigating for instance
4364240	4368800	behavior in terms of game theory this kind of modeling if you're talking about like
4368800	4375760	trust games for instance you're gonna understand how this do addict interactions evolve over time
4375840	4383200	specifically over interactions but you don't have an account of change because i have very
4383200	4391520	limited options of actions and you don't have an account also on scales and i think active
4391520	4396720	inference tries to add a little bit an account on how you can scale that and how
4396800	4399680	how
4402880	4409600	how can add more parameters into the game and see how they evolve with a more clear
4412080	4416080	understanding a richer understanding that for instance when you talk about specific
4416080	4425600	interactions in game theory so when that's one one aspect that active inference kind of
4425680	4434320	contributes another point is because we have this parameterization that is
4435360	4439920	specifically in terms of belief updating and also in terms of dynamics
4442080	4449440	we are always talking about agents that will be situated and embodied and have a very specific
4449520	4451440	uh
4454320	4459680	synchronization with the environment all the time because when you talk about active inference
4459680	4465840	the action comes always first so you have a less you try to have a less reductive model
4467920	4474160	specific and when you want to model cultural agents and collective action i think that's
4474160	4482640	kind of desirable that's what you're looking for is it also your area of interest sorry is it also
4482640	4494240	your area of interest mine or is that laryna's area of interest laryna's what do you mean oh sorry
4494240	4499280	like my question was also like what brings you to active inference and i think you answered a lot
4499280	4505760	of ways in which active inference adds theoretical value but i wasn't sure like if that was also
4505760	4511840	your subjective interest or motivation it's my subjective interest yeah i'm curious to see how
4511840	4519600	that pans out right i'm interested in how that helps us to to think of this type of
4520240	4522720	uh
4522720	4530160	phenomena and i'm very interested in how this relationship for agents to collectives and back
4530160	4531360	again work like
4536080	4543440	and i think it might give us some well it gives us some very insightful way of modeling
4544160	4545440	these relationships
4545920	4555600	in navigating is as you want because this this uh feature of being scale free is kind of helpful
4557120	4564000	to looking things you can you can define your uh mark of blanket in terms of what you're interested
4564000	4566560	right and see what happens
4566560	4576800	i don't know yeah i'll i'll i'll just give a few thoughts even though also surely some of these
4576800	4584880	thoughts are are scattered um you asked tj what does active inference add to our theoretical
4584880	4593200	accounts of the social it does many things in in my view and that's what makes it so valuable
4593840	4602080	epistemically and pragmatically it gives us the expressivity within a scale to describe
4602080	4609200	collective behavior and across scales to describe nested systems so that brings continuity to
4609200	4614880	discussions of the social with broader discussions of the biological ecological
4615520	4621760	computational physical and so on so that's a multi-scale transdisciplinary element
4622560	4629840	active inference provides us with legible first principles which can either be taken
4629840	4638400	instrumentally as just heretics and also in certain situations can be viewed empirically
4639360	4646720	as justifiable first principles and then from those legible first principles which are not
4646720	4654240	english specific they're already in a space that has a lot more
4657520	4665120	possibility and promise then for example a mere enumeration of important adjectives or nouns
4666720	4670000	we can develop lists of important adjectives and nouns
4670960	4678720	when we have a broader cognitive modeling framework and so this methodological turn
4679840	4687440	then supports just a tremendous diversity of thought and work instead of asking us to kind of
4687440	4693520	go through the eye of the needle and you know get on board with this one ranking of features
4694160	4700000	and then try to apply it more broadly that's like an overfit before the cart situation
4700560	4707680	with active we can expand the methodological discussion connect it to theoretical physics
4707680	4713440	and mathematics in ways that really haven't been seen before and then that opens up more
4713440	4722000	than it closes down it brings up more questions than it resolves in and of itself but it opens
4722080	4729680	the questions that can be resolved like what generative model can I make that will keep the
4729680	4735360	temperature in this building livable but active inference isn't going to have a stance on what
4735360	4743280	you should do for that building so we need to in a way take a step in the methodological direction
4743680	4752480	which I see as moving towards active inference to enable a million steps in different directions
4757360	4764320	I have a bunch of questions here I think one is probably just a reference question
4765280	4770960	the three topics that I'll say if you guys have any papers or articles on those things I would love
4770960	4779520	to like get a reference one is in what ways can we model a collection or an aggregation of active
4779520	4788240	inference asians as a like super agent or like super like active inference super agent or something
4788240	4794880	and like how does this like decomposition and aggregation like flexibility work in different
4794880	4802560	contexts like if there's like work that tries to either make informal commentary or formal
4802560	4809520	modeling either ways I would love to see that secondly just quick on the first just on the first
4810320	4816800	check out the previous section of this course on collective behavior where I reviewed many
4816800	4823920	such works great thanks okay is it on the same notion is it linked from the same notion things
4824160	4830400	all in the same places and in the same playlist with this course same syllabus yes good okay
4831760	4840640	the second is is there an active inference account of say markets or economic interaction
4840640	4848560	where like your prices act as some sorts of like information signals and like like can use active
4848560	4855200	inference to then talk about aggregation in of market entities or something I'm guessing this
4855200	4861600	would also be covered in the same list indeed people have explored cognitive economics and
4861600	4867200	people are working on it but that doesn't mean it's a done deal theoretically or especially in
4867200	4873760	practice so keep going it's quite experimental still but there are a bunch of people working on
4873760	4882800	that I guess I don't remember any specific paper right now but I can I can look it up and forward
4882800	4891200	to you but yeah yeah it would be great I can drop my email address here yeah sure the third is
4891200	4896880	probably more trickier than both of these which is is there an active inference account of natural
4896880	4908640	language um yes thankfully colleagues like Elliot Murphy and others have explored specifically
4908640	4919920	the linguistic aspects of natural speech I think Lorena's lecture and area of focus generalizes
4919920	4927360	a bit beyond specific natural language because we're talking about semiotics and semantics
4928240	4934960	in a more intermodal sense however yes there's been limited work from a computational
4934960	4944400	linguistics and neurobiology perspective on speech okay so then
4948560	4953840	okay so you said something like first principles stuff when you're making a commentary on what
4953840	4959680	active inference brings I have still I have I'm still often like struggling what is active
4959680	4965200	inference offering and I like try to encounter different things I think I enjoy a lot of
4965200	4970560	philosophical questions at the conversation opens up but like I'm still like very ambivalent about
4970560	4979120	the theory um and when I read like this new book uh which Friston has not written uh but like is
4979120	4987280	and quarter I don't remember was the name of the book um uh yeah I don't exactly remember there's
4987280	4992960	a book right which is like supposedly like supposed to be the canon and like Friston as a
4992960	5003280	co-author but in the preface he says so so that's the 2022 par Friston Pazulo textbook right par yeah
5003280	5011360	yeah I wouldn't quite say it's the canon since it's a short book but certainly it is a landmark
5011360	5018880	moment for the fields right and when I read that the one thing that bothered me was
5021040	5029680	it brings up the Helmholtz free energy thing but it sort of argues that by fiat like okay this is a
5029680	5037280	simple principle it can model a lot of things but that doesn't tell me why I should why I should
5037280	5044320	trust it like what what is the reason to act why why does this principle lead to cognition like
5045280	5050720	what like sure you're positive a very simple principle and then said hey look this simple
5050720	5056320	principle can explain so many things but well it can it also explain things that don't look like
5056320	5064880	cognition and like I like I'm not sure like there's an I got an account of why that principle is like
5064880	5074400	uh works or something the rain I go for it I'll think of some other ways to say it yeah you can
5074400	5081440	think of like modeling by construction and modeling by first principles and if modeling by first
5081440	5089840	principles you have you have some limitations in which you cannot fully explain some things but
5090080	5095520	the virtue of the model and how the first principle organizes everything that comes along with the
5095520	5103120	model usually might be sufficient or might be a useful a useful tool to help you explain that
5103120	5110800	phenomena that based on the first principle that you were bringing along and that's one way of
5110800	5117120	one part of answering this question is I think it might be a big question for the for the field
5117600	5124080	for the field yeah here here's some short little threads on that
5125440	5132480	yeah we can describe maladaptive cognitive systems or adaptive cognitive systems whether
5132480	5138080	something's adaptive or not is always in relationship to its niche like the foraging algorithm that
5138080	5144320	works in the desert doesn't necessarily work in the rainforest so these systems are like intrinsically
5145040	5152080	adaptive or not we want to have natural language that allows sentences that are valid and invalid
5152720	5156880	and have different kinds of semantics so again this is just an expressivity framework
5157680	5165520	that enables people to build cognitive models of high reliability or important settings or you
5165520	5171040	could make something that looks just like a beautiful circuit board and not even worry about
5171040	5176400	what the outcome is so yeah for sure you can describe all kinds of systems that would be like
5177520	5183600	having a less than functional methodological system if we said well we're doing the linear
5183600	5188240	regression framework but we only want positive regressions it's like well no at the methodological
5188240	5194000	level we want it to be able to do any slope so here in the cognitive modeling setting we want
5194000	5198480	more expressivity so that we can actually construct the ones that we're interested in
5198560	5208400	and then how does this really do cognition how is it that a first principles like surprise
5208400	5214000	minimization or the bounding of surprise through free energy how can that really cover
5215120	5222800	so many cognitive phenomena that's the question and the play but how is it that
5222800	5228880	Newton's laws of motion can describe so many objects being dropped off a tower
5230800	5237840	how is it that Bayesian mechanics can describe so many different priors being updated
5239040	5246080	and so by understanding cognitive paths as paths of least action which is the free energy principle
5246400	5263600	a wide variety of models become of a of a similar kind now yeah whether that's useful to a given
5263600	5267920	person in a given setting like if you make an active inference model of your business it doesn't
5267920	5272000	mean you're gonna succeed if you make a self-driving car with active inference it doesn't mean it's
5272000	5281040	gonna work this isn't a guarantee of success but it's a method that can be utilized and we know
5281040	5288720	that the method reaches different kinds of modeling outcomes and supports subsequent
5288720	5295920	perspectives and models from where it reaches but we can't a priori limit where the method reaches
5295920	5302080	to like only the successful ones or only biological systems then we wouldn't even have
5302080	5306480	the expressivity to talk about cognitive ecosystems with synthetic intelligences
5308880	5314800	um and when you're talking about cognition also we can use this kind of first principles
5315600	5321200	to model aspects of cognition but you might not necessarily think that cognition is all encompassing
5321280	5326800	like that everywhere all the same but you can ease that to model specific things that you're
5326800	5333760	interested in in cognitive behavior like adaptivity does it give me any insight to understand what is
5333760	5340640	adaptive adaptive behavior for instance and which kind of insights do i get are they interesting
5340640	5347760	are they useful so that's what the availability that this kind of model bring along so you can
5348400	5352880	you don't have to believe in in the whole story but it gives you a lot of leverage
5352880	5357440	to ask ask questions and what kind of questions you'll be asking
5361840	5367200	okay so let's say that like free like active inference and free energy allows me to talk about
5367200	5376800	systems but does it give also give me vocabulary to then classify those systems
5377760	5383280	in terms of let's say adaptivity would be one property but like there could be other properties
5383280	5394000	in terms of like how much how rich the world model is or stuff like that or yeah um if you have
5394640	5400880	a portfolio of generative models you could summarize them according to the tj statistic
5401600	5406960	you could summarize them according to the number of nodes you could put them into a common environment
5406960	5413200	or different environments and summarize their activity in any number of ways but we can't
5414320	5419840	talk about a ranking or summarization of a portfolio of generative models that's not in hand
5420720	5424080	this is a framework that lets us build those diverse generative models
5425040	5430880	and then in a very open-ended way do model comparison model selection model adequacy
5431760	5438880	all the kinds of complex systems engineering methods that we want
5441520	5450320	and also I would ask you where do you see a peer or a comparison first principle
5451680	5456240	you know active inference has legible first principles which are reflected in the active
5456240	5461360	inference ontology and expressions using it which can be represented in natural language so that's
5461360	5468080	the talking about it but it's not only represented in natural language other frameworks have other
5468080	5475440	first principles that may or may not be legible and people may choose different paths to go down
5475440	5482560	for whichever number of reasons well right models like they have the virtue you can compare them
5482640	5487120	and see which one gives you the best insight that you're looking for
5488320	5495360	well so yeah I think like something that I could compare to active inference is like say the
5495360	5502800	Bayesian utility maximization thing and which has a different ontology I'm not a fan of that either
5502800	5510320	like that also I'll just note that Bayesian utility maximization is a special case of free energy
5510960	5518160	where there's no epistemic value all you have is pragmatic value and so a special diminished case
5519200	5523520	not necessarily you have value of information and you have explore exploit trade-offs
5524320	5531440	in Bayesian utility maximization as well like you like like if you load into your utility function
5532000	5538000	if you can beg the question and load episteme into pragma you're right then all you need is
5538000	5544800	pragma but in expected free energy we have epistemic and pragmatic value which is what enables
5544800	5553760	us this expressivity but I think we're aligned on that right I think like I'm somewhat like also
5553760	5558640	slightly confused because in the Bayesian utility like between the languages comparing the languages
5558640	5566880	as such like in the Bayesian utility maximization the exploration parts that are prioritized based on
5568000	5578800	your X and the estimation on the value of information whereas I'm not sure that holds true
5578800	5587280	for the active inference model as well that the epistemic exploration is prioritized or valued
5587280	5600640	in terms of some of the same pragmatic thing as well. You'll have a lot to explore and learn
5600640	5607520	you can make a model that is 80-20 or 20-80 or 100-0 between epistemic and pragmatic
5607520	5612640	there's nothing we can say across generative models about whether active inference prioritizes
5612640	5622800	episteme or not because you can make a model that's 100% or 0. Sorry I meant more like does active
5622800	5628000	inference allow us to talk about systems that the Bayesian utility maximization doesn't allow us to
5628000	5635360	talk about. I'm talking particularly about expressive power of the language. Are there
5636000	5639520	things that the Bayesian utility maximization can talk about that active inference cannot
5639520	5643200	other things that active inference can talk about that Bayesian utility maximization cannot.
5643200	5651360	Two short answers one short answer utility maximization must cram epistemic value into
5651360	5657920	pragmatic value we gain more expressivity when we can articulate out pragmatic value which is the
5657920	5663040	alignment of preferences with observations from epistemic value which is information gain so
5663040	5669440	that's a huge articulation and the second thing is when you're in a anything maximization framework
5669920	5673840	when you're in a utility function now again bagging the question how you constructed this
5673840	5678960	function that you're trying to maximize. When you're in a maximization framework we have a well
5678960	5687280	known set of approaches for finding local and global maxima using optimization or maximization
5687280	5694000	frameworks. What active inference uniquely provides is it describes the path that that
5694000	5703280	cognitive thing takes as a path of least action that minimizes surprise so instead of climbing
5703280	5708720	to the top of the hill up are we on a foothill or are we on the biggest hill we're like a ball rolling
5708720	5714320	to the bottom of the hill finding the least surprising path now that least surprising path
5714320	5721280	can still include novelty and information gain but it turns out to be a lot more tractable
5721280	5725840	and connected with statistical physics and quantum mechanics when we talk about the path of
5725840	5732240	least action ball rolling down the hill rather than this sort of question bag on top of a mountain
5732240	5740960	climbing adventure Bayesian utility approach. But it's up to each person to feel how they want to
5740960	5749040	feel. Yeah it's a little bit what's in the book as well when you take the low and high road for
5749280	5758960	energy principle right because how much you want to have your utility maximization function being
5761440	5764720	disconnected to the pragma to do to the action.
5767280	5772400	Because when you're modeling behavior it will be hard to do that independently like you have a
5772400	5778800	lot of you have way more assumptions you're committing too much to a greater level of assumptions
5778800	5781920	for your utility function if you don't do that.
5785040	5793120	Because with the pragma with the action first that pragmatizes you have reasons to describe
5793120	5800080	have reasons to believe why that information gain works the way that it does. You can leverage
5800080	5807840	explanations on that without it you have a model that has more assumptions and I think if you have
5807840	5812640	a model with less assumptions it's always healthier let's say so.
5815120	5821200	Yeah so I think like that that that does talk about the compare compare the analysis of the
5821200	5828000	expressivity but I would also say as a meta point that like I'm not happy with either of those languages
5828800	5835760	I'm like I suspect that both of those languages claim certain ontological assumptions and I'm
5835760	5840000	like always suspicious but wait but like where are these ontological assumptions coming from.
5841360	5851280	A few other points we tap into an absolutely meaningful nexus of statistical methods and
5851280	5856400	message passing schemes with active inference if you can state something in the active inference
5856400	5864080	ontology and construct a generative model then message passing algorithms can be deployed that
5864080	5869360	contractively compute that model so that's absolutely non-trivial otherwise it's possible
5869360	5876480	just to get wrapped up in some analytical formalism but then once you want to do that on a 4k video
5877920	5882880	now you're on square zero with the computer engineering this is not that way and then I
5882880	5889200	will respond to your meta point with a meta point which is when we've enumerated the alternatives
5890160	5896400	the one that we like best personally I feel happy with I'm also open to new alternatives arising but
5896400	5908800	being unhappy when all things considered is in play why. What bothers you specifically on the ontology
5909360	5923200	of the active inference. Yeah like I think like I'm still looking for I don't know what exactly
5923200	5927920	I'm looking for but I'm I feel dissatisfied with the account given for why Helmholtz free energy
5928880	5937520	least action thing like is the central thing here or something like why does it work like why
5937520	5949200	does this principle yeah. There's a lot of funny answers I could give there that that delta that
5949200	5956960	discrepancy that's curiosity and that's the space of the open and that's learning and that's your
5956960	5966480	unique contribution to make and that's everything so that's not just a thorn in your shoe that's like
5967520	5976480	our experience of action amidst uncertainty which is the water we're in and so whether we
5977200	5982320	take a higher order narrative perspective on that discrepancy being dissatisfying
5982880	5988720	or that discrepancy being satisfying I think it's pretty. I just need to minimize my surprise there
5989520	5992640	yeah and you can choose to minimize your surprise through your attention
5993440	6001120	you can choose to minimize surprise at a higher narrative order like I'm satisfied and complacent
6001120	6005680	that I don't understand number theory but I use numbers to count objects around me
6006560	6010160	so that discrepancy and understanding knowing that there's a thousand years of research
6010880	6017520	that could be done on numbers it doesn't unsettle me but for someone else that might be unsettling
6018240	6022480	and that might lead them to ruminate it also might lead them to do a phd and number theory
6023040	6030000	so just different paths for different individuals and contexts but there's always so many technical
6030000	6040400	and meta levels with active huh. Okay so I don't want to like keep you guys over time but I would
6040400	6046800	ask one last reference based thing which is are there active inference accounts of seeing
6046800	6053760	like a state phenomena uh in any literature I think I heard you mention it once so I was like
6053760	6064160	yeah like this yeah check out live stream 33 series but also this course that we're literally
6064160	6075200	actually enacting in with Avel is where these accounts come to roost and where we're creating
6075200	6081360	a space to develop it and it's not a cathedral for us just to spectate at today but if you
6081360	6087360	want to make an active inference generative model of whatever social setting when you have the model
6087360	6098560	in hand a lot of your questions will be sidestepped okay where is the 33 thing that you mentioned
6099200	6106240	if you go to the page with all of our institute live streams and look in the live stream
6106240	6112400	series like the paper discussions in the 33 series there's a dot zero video with background and
6112400	6118320	context and then we have a dot one and a dot two conversation with the authors but Avel who's also
6118320	6125920	the course coordinator for this course and kairos research like Avel's and and colleagues work has
6126560	6134160	heavily built on the seeing like a state thinking like a state optimal grasp all these different
6134160	6143520	topics yeah I'm yeah I'm on your youtube channel I'm slightly finding it hard to find the thing
6146160	6153440	if you look up live stream 033.0 or if you go to in the video description of any video where it says
6153440	6158640	all live streams here go there and search for but you'll find it and you can always email us
6159280	6165840	or get in contact but yeah and I think Avel's paper like thinking like a state also can help
6165840	6173520	you a lot to understand how how active inference modeling is useful for the social sciences in
6173520	6179600	comparison to other types of modeling he makes an comprehensive description interesting
6180400	6190080	great thanks and this is this is our first iteration on this course we are going to continue
6191280	6195520	bringing new information to the table and supporting individuals who want to build
6195520	6202160	generative models you know around this area whether it's part of an internship program
6202160	6208560	or part of a course credit or different kinds of programs that we'll be able to develop but
6209600	6215200	this is the real thing and we're able to work with people who want to think and do
6216960	6224560	make sense indeed any closing thoughts on tj then I will go and then Lorena with last word
6225920	6229440	um no that this was great thanks thanks for the conversation
6231280	6237600	thank you well thank you for bringing tj for joining Lorena for the lecture this was a fun
6238400	6245040	discussion we never really know where how it's gonna go but I'm glad that we could cover
6245840	6255440	so many of these topics and probably raise more questions and footholds than door slams so thank
6255440	6264160	you again Lorena yeah thank you for inviting me and I think active inference like holds a lot of
6264160	6270160	space for experimenting as well some things you try to see if they make sense and they're gonna hold
6270160	6278880	up and open new questions and that might be an interesting aspect of uh of the framework itself
6281840	6286080	thank you everybody thank you everybody for the great live chat comments there's a lot
6286080	6289600	there I couldn't read at all so till next time
6316080	6317300	you
