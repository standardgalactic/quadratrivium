00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,200
Hello and welcome, everyone. It's July 22nd, 2024. This is Active Inference guest stream

2
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:23,400
82.3. The Projective Wave Theory of Consciousness. Robert Warden will give a presentation and

3
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,920
we have several others to join and comment and give their insights. So thank you everyone

4
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:34,360
for joining and Robert, please begin the presentation. And also, Robert, close the YouTube on your

5
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,440
side. All good.

6
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,320
It's Active Inference guest stream 82.3.

7
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:39,840
Right.

8
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,400
I've objectively, it's coming through on my loud speaker, which is a problem.

9
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,960
Yeah, it's all good. Like, all good.

10
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:27,240
Okay. So this is a talk about the Projective Wave Theory of Consciousness. And there's

11
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:33,080
already a paper about it on Archive this month. So you can look at the paper if you like.

12
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:40,440
But let me start by describing roughly the roadmap for the talk. The Projective Wave

13
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:46,200
Theory is very closely related to the Projective Consciousness Model, PCM. And we're fortunate

14
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,880
to have three of the authors of that model on the call today. But I'm going to give this talk

15
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:59,960
in four different parts. The first part is talking about data. And the idea is that any theory of

16
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:06,200
consciousness has to fit the data, has to fit some data in order for us to believe it. And so the

17
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:11,800
question is, what kinds of data is there about consciousness that the theory has to fit? And I

18
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:18,120
should be arguing that the main kind of data we have is spatial consciousness. So that's part one

19
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,400
of the talk. Part two, I shall talk about the Projective Consciousness Model, PCM. And to my

20
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:29,480
mind, the big virtue of the PCM is that it does predict account for just that, the spatial nature

21
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:35,880
of consciousness. And in that, it's a great deal. It does a great deal better than many neural theories

22
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:42,680
of consciousness. And I shall probably pause at that point after parts one and two and have

23
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:49,960
discussion about the first two points there. But before that, I think the PCM has great

24
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:56,280
strengths. But I think in common with all neural theories of consciousness, it has three problems.

25
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,160
And I shall talk about what those problems are. But I shall emphasize that those problems are not

26
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:09,080
specific to the PCM. If you buy into the classical neural model of the brain that neurons do everything,

27
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,000
then whatever your theory of consciousness, I think you're going to have these problems.

28
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,440
And so in order to get out of those problems, we have to do something that's not in the classical

29
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:23,960
neural model that assumes that neurons in the brain do everything. So we have to add something

30
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:30,280
to the PCM. And the something we have to add is there in three. The assumption we're going to add

31
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:35,080
to it is quite a big one. It's an assumption that there is a wave in the brain which stores

32
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:41,640
3D spatial information. In other words, neurons don't do everything. And then part four of the

33
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:47,880
talk, I shall bring those two and three together to a projective wave theory of consciousness.

34
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:53,400
And talk a little bit about firstly, how it solves the neural problems, but secondly,

35
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,520
how it fits the data and some more general considerations about it. So that is the root

36
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:07,720
map of the talk. So we start off with what are the reasons to believe some theory, whether

37
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:12,840
there's theory of consciousness or anything else. Why do we believe it? Basically, we believe a

38
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,760
theory because it fits data. And it there's a complexity measure here that needs to fit more

39
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:23,720
data, which you can measure in bits, if you like, than the complexity of the assumptions you put

40
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:28,040
into it. If you just put in a huge number of assumptions and fit a small amount of data,

41
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:33,720
that's no use. So there's a kind of Bayesian balance between the assumptions you put into a

42
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:39,640
theory and the data it fits. And I've illustrated the Bayesian balance, a pair of scales here. And

43
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:47,000
I've measured the complexity of the theory and the amount of data it tests by a so-called zip

44
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,280
test, which simply says you describe these things in text files, you zip them up and you see how big

45
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:58,040
they are. So established theories in science like a theory of physics or chemistry have a hugely

46
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:03,080
positive Bayesian balance. They have quite few assumptions and they account for huge amounts

47
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:08,440
of data. So how can we get to that point with the theory of consciousness? How can a theory of

48
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:14,840
consciousness produce a positive Bayesian balance between its assumption and the data it accounts

49
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:21,640
for? So the question arises, what is the data we have to test theories of consciousness? And there's

50
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:26,280
a big problem, which is well known, that consciousness is a private experience. So there's not much

51
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:32,120
public data about it. But there are several kinds of data we can use, such as data about levels of

52
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:39,000
consciousness, alertness and being asleep and so on, data about quality. And they are problematic

53
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,560
because they're private phenomena. But nevertheless, two people can agree something about similarity

54
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:52,760
scales of their quality, like different colors being similar or different. And the form C is the

55
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:59,720
shapes of things in spatial consciousness. And I shall argue that the main manifestation of

56
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:06,520
consciousness, which we have, what we're experiencing right now, is a 3D spatial model of the world

57
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:14,440
around us. And that 3D model is very detailed and quite faithful to the real world around us.

58
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:22,440
And so that has a large information content. Going down the list, there's conscious imagination,

59
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:27,240
there is consciousness of the self, there are anomalies and illusions of consciousness,

60
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:32,440
and there is the hard problem, if you like, the existence of consciousness itself. Now I shall

61
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:39,560
argue that point C, the shape of spatial consciousness gives us much more data to test any theory

62
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:46,200
than any other type of data. So what's the testable data in spatial consciousness?

63
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:53,720
Spatial consciousness is like a 3D model of the real world around you. That's what you're

64
00:06:54,520 --> 00:07:00,600
experiencing right now. And it has a lot of the geometry of the real world, and particularly

65
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:06,600
straight lines in consciousness correspond to straight lines in the real world. And you can

66
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:12,040
test this. I won't go into the years of how. So this agreement between our conscious experience,

67
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:16,920
which is quite information rich, and the real world around us, which is obviously information

68
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:23,480
risk, gives a lot of data to test any theory of consciousness. And I suggest roughly it gives

69
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:30,120
us thousands of bits, even in a few seconds. And I shall suggest that no other form of data

70
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:35,080
about consciousness comes anywhere close to this in terms of testable information content.

71
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:41,240
So if you really want to prove your theories right, then it's got to account for the spatial

72
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:46,760
form of consciousness if you're going to believe it. And down at the right here, I put my conclusion

73
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:52,040
that spatial consciousness is, if you like, the element in the room, consciousness theory.

74
00:07:54,200 --> 00:08:00,760
So we have to consider how the brain does spatial cognition. And all animal brains pretty much do

75
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:07,400
that. They have to understand 3D's local space for a very fundamental reason, just to control

76
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,960
their every movement, to move every movement of their limbs, they have to understand 3D space

77
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:17,160
around them. And there's been huge selection pressure to do this well. And we believe that

78
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:23,720
animals do it very well, even insects do it quite well. And also it appears that most of the animal

79
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:30,280
brain is devoted to that. Now, if we assume a Bayesian hypothesis about cognition, then the way

80
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:35,800
animals do that is to build a maximum likelihood 3D model of local space in their brains from their

81
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:43,560
sense data. So it becomes fairly natural to expect that spatial consciousness is going to be linked

82
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:49,320
to this spatial model. And the question is, is it a purely neural model as a classical neural

83
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:55,960
models of the brain? And if it is, how does neuron firing represent 3D space? And this is quite a

84
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:05,000
difficult problem. And really, there are very few viable solutions to it. But I shall switch now,

85
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,200
I shall put that problem on one side and switch to the Projective Consciousness Model, PCM,

86
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:15,400
which has been developed by David and has collaborated since about 2017, and it's built on the

87
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:20,200
free energy principle. So it's based on a Bayesian model of local space in the brain.

88
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:27,080
And for its neural process model, it assumes the process model of the free energy principle.

89
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:35,640
And so the PCM assumes that the brain holds a 3D projective transform model of local Euclidean

90
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:42,040
space. And the key thing is that PCM then predicts that spatial consciousness is like

91
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:47,640
that model. And this is a very good prediction. It agrees very well with data. For instance,

92
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,640
the trivial fact that straight lines in your consciousness are straight lines in the real

93
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:58,920
world. So the PCM has a good Bayesian balance. I should say this is very distinctive amongst

94
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:03,640
many theories of consciousness. Very few of them talk about the spatial nature of consciousness.

95
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:08,200
And if they do, they probably treat it as a bit of an afterthought. But the PCM puts it

96
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:14,200
out in the front. And I think that's a very positive feature of it. And it has a good Bayesian

97
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:19,080
balance. And it does make various other predictions which people have talked about in the papers,

98
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:24,200
makes predictions about illusions of consciousness, and makes predictions about

99
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:30,520
predictive imagination and planning actions. Now, I don't think those are quite as significant

100
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:36,280
in the Bayesian balance in the agreement with the data as the basic agreement with the

101
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:45,240
form of consciousness right now. Consciousness from sense data. But I shall say the PCM has

102
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:51,560
three difficulties. I shall emphasize they're not difficulties of the PCM alone. I believe

103
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:57,000
they are difficulties of any neural theory of consciousness. And I'll just list them briefly

104
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
here because there's going to be a slide describing them. The first difficulty is neural

105
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,840
selection. How do we pick out just those neurons which cause consciousness from all the others that

106
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:13,000
don't? And the second one is neural precision and speed. We know that our conscious model of space

107
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,840
is a very detailed and precise one. Can you do that with neuron firing? I would suggest you can't.

108
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:25,160
And the third one is a complex decoding problem that, anyway, I'll come onto that.

109
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:29,640
So I'll describe these three in a minute. But the emphasis is that they are not just problems

110
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:34,920
of the PCM. They are difficulties for any neural theory of consciousness, for instance, IIT or

111
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:42,040
global neural workspace theory and so on. So what are the three difficulties? The neural

112
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:46,920
selection problem. Most neurons in the brain are not linked to consciousness. We know that from

113
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:52,600
cortical lesions, we don't interrupt consciousness, or the cerebellum, or Bjorn Merkur has written

114
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:58,040
quite extensively about this. But neuron theories of consciousness say that the activity of some

115
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:03,160
neurons causes consciousness and not others. So the question is how are those special neurons

116
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:08,920
selected? And as far as I know, there's no sound physical basis to pick out some neurons from

117
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:14,200
all the others. So you build in some selection assumptions into your hypothesis, but those

118
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:20,440
form a debit in your Bayesian balance. So they're a debit for any neural theory of consciousness.

119
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:32,120
The second difficulty is how do neurons represent space? Now, there are several possible ways of

120
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:37,720
having neurons representing 3D space. You can represent 2D space, all right? Can you return to

121
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:43,000
sharing the screen? Oh, sorry, I've lost sharing, have I? All good.

122
00:12:51,400 --> 00:13:09,160
So how do neurons represent 3D space? There are several ways they might do it, but they all have

123
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:15,640
problems of precision and speed. For instance, there is a Bayesian computational model of how

124
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:22,040
animals build 3D internal model of space from their sense data. And this is already on one of the

125
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:28,360
AI live streams that this YouTube address. But that model shows that in order to build a 3D model

126
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:35,720
of space, even for a small animal like a bee, you need memory storage errors to be roughly the order

127
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:42,920
1% as small as that. Whereas if you model neurons accurately, properly, they don't give you this

128
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:51,800
precision because in a neuron, most theoretical models of neurons are ideal abstract neurons whose

129
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:58,600
outputs are real variables of high precision. And that's shown in the top of this picture here.

130
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:04,840
Whereas actually, neurons' outputs are spike trains, which in a short time scale gives very

131
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:09,720
limited precision. For instance, in a fifth of the second possible time scale for consciousness,

132
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:17,800
you may get about 10 pulses. And that gives you a precision of only 30% in that time scale.

133
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:23,560
So the precision you get from neural representations is very different from what you need to build

134
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:29,880
a decent 3D model or what we experience in consciousness. And this, I think, hasn't been

135
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:34,440
really spotted very much because most of the neural models that you see in the literature,

136
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,600
they don't model spike trains. It's different enough to model networks of neurons. And so

137
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:45,160
they use abstract, precise neurons. So that's the second difficulty. How can neurons store

138
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:50,760
precise and responsive, fast model of 3D space like the one we experience?

139
00:14:52,200 --> 00:15:00,840
Finally, can you see that change? Third difficulty? The third difficulty is what I call the hard

140
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:07,560
triangle because conscious experience, which is C in this picture here, is a faithful, hardly

141
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:13,720
distorted model of the real world. There's the real world, A, and there's consciousness

142
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:20,840
awareness, C. But what the models we have found in the brain are two-dimensional models and very

143
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:26,680
distorted models. And so they're many different models, and they're highly complex encoding to

144
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:34,040
get from A to B. So if you want to get back from B to C, you have to do very complex decoding to

145
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:41,320
undo all the complex coding that most species brains do. And so ABC is the hard triangle.

146
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:48,120
You have to have complex decoding assumptions in any neural theory of consciousness. And the

147
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:53,800
worst thing of that maybe is that the decoding has to be species specific. It can't be universal

148
00:15:53,800 --> 00:16:02,280
decoding. So those are the three difficulties for any neural theory of consciousness, including the

149
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:11,000
PCM, I believe. So that's where we've got to. I've covered topics one and two of this talk,

150
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,600
and now I think we'll break for any discussion or contributions.

151
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:26,200
Thank you very much, Robert, for your presentation up to now. I can follow it very well. I think

152
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:33,640
you point out very important issues. I should say, and perhaps we scan,

153
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:42,920
that from the standpoint of the PCM, even though indeed we have framed it in the context of active

154
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:49,560
influence and more specifically the free energy principle, we do not necessarily

155
00:16:50,520 --> 00:17:00,600
entail, it does not necessarily entail that we buy or we endorse or we believe in

156
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:09,320
the current neural network models that are used in this context. Personally, I've been a neuroscientist

157
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:16,360
for many years. I've done a lot of electrophysiology, lesion work with human patients. Also, I worked

158
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:22,040
with rodent. I've done a lot of functionally maging and modeling. At some point in my career,

159
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:27,240
I thought that I did not understand the brain well enough, and I stopped doing neuroscience. I stopped

160
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:35,160
carrying quote-unquote about the brain. For us, what is the most important in the PCM at this point

161
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:41,400
is all you said, is that we can capture some aspect of this phenomenology that seems essential,

162
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:47,160
et cetera, et cetera. Personally, I have given up at this point trying to

163
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:59,640
devise or figure out any realistic neural network models. When you take just one neuron,

164
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:09,080
as you said, Robert, it's a universe. You just think about how receptors are

165
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:14,760
or downregulated through fast gene expression or dendritic trees and their complexities

166
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:23,640
and their geometry plays a role in computation. I don't believe that the spiking of the neurons,

167
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:28,360
which we often call the output of the neuron, are necessarily where we should be looking at.

168
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:36,760
I don't know where we should be looking at. I committed an odd paper a long time ago in 2015,

169
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:44,120
in which I kind of said, well, I explained why I had given up hope at this point about brain

170
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:48,840
science to account for that, because I think we don't understand the brain. I think they are

171
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:57,560
principle we haven't figured out yet by far. My guess was that a bit like by analogy with

172
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:03,400
computer science, there are layers of abstraction, mechanism of virtualization that hide the detail

173
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:10,600
of the hardware, which we don't understand at all. And so far, it's a very open-ended thing.

174
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:17,160
So to me, what matters the most about the PCM at this point is with respect to the brain,

175
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:22,360
it is neutral. We don't know. At this point, I have absolutely no hypothesis, except very

176
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:28,760
gross anatomy of hypothesis, but also possible details about, but you're right,

177
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:34,360
that's the hard problem. And personally, I have given up on trying to account for it.

178
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:43,080
Thanks, David. I find so much to agree with there. And so, yeah, we don't understand what's going on

179
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:48,520
in the brain. Maybe neurons are doing something much more complicated than simple spike trains,

180
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:55,240
but maybe there's also this wave, and we'll talk about that. Carl, Ken, do you have any comments

181
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:02,920
on this thing? Carl, you want to go ahead? Or I can, if you don't mind, I'll just follow up with,

182
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:13,320
I completely agree with what David said. And I will say my own sort of approach to the problem has

183
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:20,120
always been sort of agnostic about the underlying realization. So I've kind of started from,

184
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:27,080
in my own thinking anyway, always from the point of view of phenomenology with some kind of,

185
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:36,840
you might say, general acceptance of some sort of physicalism, but agnostic about the details of

186
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:44,680
that physicalism. So agnostic about whether it's exactly what goes on in the brain or what level

187
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:53,080
and so on. I guess I've tended to, even though I agree you can't exclude it a priori, I've tended

188
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:57,720
to kind of think, well, quantum mechanical theories are probably barking up the wrong tree,

189
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:05,400
but that's just like my gut on that. And then I'm sorry, personally, Ken, at this point,

190
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,560
I'm so confused about the brain and about the physical nature of the universe that

191
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,320
I'm even totally open that the whole thing is quantum. I have no idea.

192
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:20,280
Okay. Yeah, as I said, it's just sort of like my gut on that, but not, I can't really defend it

193
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:29,400
in detail for a number of reasons, going to my own ignorance. But and I would just add that,

194
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:37,400
and I agree, I think the way you presented the PCM, generally was exactly right. You did mention

195
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:46,200
that we do have something to say about imagination, like action planning, and about anomalies and

196
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:53,400
illusions. And we, you know, we agree with you, I think that the main set of data we aim to capture

197
00:21:53,400 --> 00:22:01,400
are the spatial component of consciousness and the perspectival spatial component, like,

198
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:06,440
you know, the project, what we use, projective geometry to capture. But then we do try to,

199
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:15,160
as you know, try to derive certain other bits of parts of the relevant data from that basis. So

200
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:22,040
accounting for illusions, like the moon illusion and the aims room illusion, and accounting for

201
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:31,560
imaginative action planning. And also, I should add some data about self awareness. So we have

202
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:41,080
paper on self awareness in this context as well. So, yeah, I think that's all I got so far. But

203
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:47,000
this is this has been very interesting so far. Thanks again. Come on.

204
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:56,280
How can I make any comments? No, I'm just enjoying this as a spectator,

205
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:04,200
batting for both sides. One comment, it seems to me that we're focusing on the distinction between

206
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:13,640
principles on about how the brain makes sense of its world and the process theories that attend

207
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:20,040
those principles in terms of instantiation. And there's an agnostic approach I think you can take

208
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:28,360
in relation to process theories. So I'm interested to see how much Robert's focus will be on the

209
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:39,720
process theory and the actual substrates, which I think is interesting from the point of view of

210
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:50,840
actually simulating this kind of inference and also being able to reproduce it in silico in

211
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:59,800
terms of creating a kind of artificial intelligence that has this kind of competence. So there may

212
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:07,400
be a more pragmatic focus. I was intrigued by the previous slide, this hard triangle.

213
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:25,640
Yeah, just go to it there. Yeah, I didn't quite resonate with this. I think for a start the

214
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:33,240
notions of encoding and decoding for people like me should be usefully unpacked. So everything in

215
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:41,800
terms of belief updating is some kind of mapping or morphism or relationship. So I'm assuming...

216
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:50,840
Mapping is a good word for it. Yeah. Okay, so the world generates sensory inputs and then the brain

217
00:24:53,320 --> 00:25:00,840
represents those inputs. I mean, for B, you just imagine the visual cortex with a highly distorted

218
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:07,000
version of space in it, all around the fovea and so on, and all the other cortical maps,

219
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,440
a highly distorted representation of space. Somehow you have to tram all those back into

220
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:17,720
an undistorted representation. So you've got to decode the encoding that's gone on.

221
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:28,760
I see. Right, so the conscious awareness is still part of the brain somewhere.

222
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:37,400
But it must come from the brain somewhere, I think. Yes, we all. I see. So you're using encoding and

223
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:48,280
decoding in a sort of... Distorting, undistorting. It's like a distorting mirror, you've got to

224
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:55,240
undistort it. But I guess it relates to Karl's distinction between neural substrate and process

225
00:25:55,240 --> 00:26:02,040
theory. Because indeed, if you look at the classical sort of quote-unquote 2D maps in the

226
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:07,880
cerebral cortex, for instance, the visual cortex with your retinotopy, where you see a lot of

227
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:13,800
deformation, but also somatosensory cortices, you think about the classical map of the body.

228
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:21,480
And you are saying, well, if that's the way it is kind of represented quote-unquote at the level of

229
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:27,320
that substrate, then since it is deformed and we don't experience it that way, we should somehow

230
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:33,080
have a process on top of that that use some morphism to transform this deformation.

231
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:39,320
I'm saying our theory of consciousness has to tell us how that unscrambling distortion happens.

232
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:44,520
Yeah, but I believe that the level of observation that we are considering here,

233
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:48,360
for instance, those 2D quote-unquote 2D, because they are not really 2D, but

234
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:57,400
cortical maps, retinotopic or somatotopic or topic maps are a very quote-unquote low level

235
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:03,880
of processing, which might be very far away from what is going on at the level of the process.

236
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:07,960
There might be some other super representation somewhere, but we've not found it yet.

237
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,640
Yeah, it might not be visible at the level of the anatomy.

238
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:17,160
Well, yeah, those are alternatives, I agree.

239
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:21,240
Okay, so sorry Carl, I interrupted, but I wanted to make this precision too.

240
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:25,320
Yeah, no, that clarifies it, thank you.

241
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:32,520
But Carl, I think we can all be agnostic about certain things in the process model.

242
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:36,040
I think you and I at least are not agnostic about basing into them.

243
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,840
Yeah, I would put the notion of

244
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:50,920
sentience of the kind we're talking about as a process of basing belief updating.

245
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:57,240
I put that at the sort of principle level, at the mechanics that doesn't commit to

246
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:07,720
an infrastructure or a realization or a process that realizes that kind of principle,

247
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:16,840
that kind of mechanics. So I think the spatial wave theory is really a commitment to a process

248
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:24,040
theory that could happily accommodate basing belief updating and its particular application,

249
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:29,560
the context of spatial perception and the projected consciousness model.

250
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:37,720
You're muted.

251
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:43,400
Oh, yes.

252
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:18,200
Okay, so moving on.

253
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:26,840
So we've done one and two, and what we're going to do in three is add something to the PCM.

254
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,200
And the thing we're going to add is not a little thing.

255
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:36,760
It's the assumption, the hypothesis that neurons don't do everything, but there is a wave in the

256
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:40,840
brain which stores 3D spatial information. So that's what I'm going to talk about next.

257
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:46,200
So here's the hypothesis. There is a wave in the brain that represents 3D space.

258
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:53,800
So it assumes there is some nearly spherical region of the brain with a diameter D and it

259
00:29:53,800 --> 00:30:00,680
holds waves, which couples the neurons. And there the sphere is illustrated and a couple of waves,

260
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:05,640
wavelength lambda two, the green wave, and wavelength lambda one, a shorter wavelength,

261
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:11,800
that red wave. And those waves represent things in space. And they represent the red

262
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:18,360
thing R1 and the green thing R2. So there's an inverse relationship there. The shorter the

263
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:23,720
wavelength, the longer the distance to the thing that's being represented. But obviously,

264
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:29,960
if it's a spherical region, you can have waves in any direction. So you can represent any direction

265
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:34,440
and any distance up to a maximum, which is defined by the minimum wavelength.

266
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:41,320
So that wave can represent lots of different things. And the hypothesis is that that wave

267
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:48,200
acts as a working memory for space. It's really like a hologram. Now, one issue with that is

268
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:54,360
that if you want to represent objects at very large distances away, then you get into wavelengths

269
00:30:54,360 --> 00:31:01,080
that's too short. So that's why you may need a projective transform of space to pull in those

270
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:08,600
long distances to be able to represent them on the wave. By the way, the evidence for this wave

271
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:13,800
is going to be described in another YouTube livestream, which we're making next week,

272
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:21,720
is going to get that address. So, well, there's a wave based spatial memory form.

273
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:28,760
It can represent approximately d of a lambda cubed independent positions, which is quite a lot.

274
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:34,920
And it can give you spatial precision for the order of lambda over d. And the point is that this

275
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:40,600
can easily be 1% or better, which is the precision you need. So there are significant benefits to

276
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:46,360
wave storage. It has high capacity. You can put many objects in it. It has a high precision.

277
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:51,960
It can be fast. And it has low spatial distortion. It is just like a hologram.

278
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:02,120
And it's a very simple and direct representation of space. So a spoiler looking at part four of

279
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:08,360
the talk is that this is very much like spatial consciousness. Question is there any evidence

280
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:14,120
for such a wave? I think there is evidence and there's three kinds of evidence. First two come

281
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:19,800
from brain anatomy, because there are spherical regions in the brain, which are very well suited

282
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:25,480
to hold this wave. In the mammals, there is a thalamus, and that's shown in green on the

283
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:32,520
left of the picture. And you see it's approximately spherical. And that is very suitably connected

284
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:37,160
for holding spatial information. It's connected to all the sense data, and it's connected to all

285
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:43,480
the bits of cortex that work out what to do with the sense data. And similarly, in the insect brain,

286
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:49,320
there is a central body in the very center of it. That is approximately spherical, and it's very

287
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:57,000
well preserved shape in all insect species. So those are both pieces of evidence for a wave in

288
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:05,640
the brain. There is a place for it. So I believe there are three lines of evidence for a wave.

289
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:10,840
One is the computational neuroscience, which I mentioned before, that spatial cognition is a

290
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:17,480
very important thing, but neural memory for it is too imprecise and too slow. Whereas a wave

291
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:23,000
storage model can possibly overcome these problems. So that's the yellow evidence, the evidence from

292
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:29,160
the insect central body that is nearly round, very central, very well connected. And there's evidence

293
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:35,880
from the mammalian thalamus. It's also round and well connected. But there's also what I call a

294
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:40,680
smoking gun for a wave in the thalamus that if you don't assume a wave, the anatomy of the

295
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:46,280
thalamus doesn't make sense. But I won't go into that in this talk. So together, I believe these

296
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:52,520
give quite strong support for the wave hypothesis. In fact, they give it a probability of 0.5

297
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:58,600
approximately, even if you try and weight the odds against it. As I say, you can see the

298
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:03,320
discussion of this in another YouTube live stream we're about to make. So

299
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,680
then that's on from part three to part four of talk.

300
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:16,440
Assume there is a wave in the brain, which holds the near-projective transform of 3D space. And

301
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:22,920
this wave is serving a very essential role to understand space to control all movements for

302
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:28,440
any animal. And the hypothesis simply is the wave is the origin of consciousness.

303
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:33,800
That neurons have nothing to do with consciousness at all. It comes entirely from the wave.

304
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:40,440
This solves three problems, the three problems that I outlined before. Firstly, the neural selection

305
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:45,320
problem, no selection problem, because neurons have nothing to do with consciousness. The precision

306
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:50,840
and speed problem, the wave has sufficient precision and speed to do it. And the decoding

307
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:57,560
problem, the coding in the wave is just a Fourier transform. So it's a very simple coding,

308
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:02,840
encoding, and it's a very simple decoding to give you back conscious experience.

309
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:09,560
So it has solved those three problems of neural theories. But the main thing is that spatial

310
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:15,240
like the PCM, preserving the merit of the PCM, the spatial form of consciousness

311
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:21,880
agrees very well with our conscious experience. It has to be projected because we need the

312
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:28,120
projection transform to pull in objects from very large distances to represent them by a minimum

313
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:34,600
wavelength. So in summary, the projective wave theory has a positive Bayesian balance,

314
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:40,520
doesn't have any Nazis about it, and it agrees very well with the main source of data about consciousness.

315
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:47,400
So just some aspects of this theory. What is the physical nature of the wave? A big objection

316
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:53,320
might be we've never seen the wave because I believe it's probably not an electromagnetic

317
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:59,960
wave or an electromagnetic field. And the main reason I believe that is that electromagnetic

318
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:04,600
fields on their own don't store information. For the time periods, we need to store information.

319
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:09,160
And now electromagnetic fields might be part of the answer, but I think they're not the whole

320
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:15,800
answer. And the big question then is why have we not detected this wave in the brain? It's been

321
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:22,360
there all these years. I think the reason for that is if there is a wave representing space,

322
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:28,280
we will expect it to evolve to have very low intensity. So its energy consumption is very

323
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:33,720
small. And having that low intensity, we simply haven't known how to look for it.

324
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:40,200
Now, coming to quantum possibilities, the wave might be a coherent quantum

325
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:46,040
excitation. And there's increasing evidence that quantum effects do have a role in biology.

326
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:53,800
And it might even be a Bose-Einstein condensate, a BEC. Now those examples of those are superconductors

327
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:59,640
and superfluids, they're very rash state in nature. But the key thing about a BEC is

328
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:05,560
a superconductor can hold information for unlimited time. So it would be good for memory.

329
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:12,920
And they're a very rare and distinctive state of matter. And so if you assume that consciousness

330
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:19,640
comes from them, you don't get to a trough of panpsychism. Or it might not be a quantum effect,

331
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:24,680
because I think that this question is entirely open. So we'll set that on one side and that's

332
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:31,640
future exploration. There is an issue about the evolution of consciousness. We know that

333
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:36,200
consciousness is, our consciousness is like the real world. It's very like the real world.

334
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:41,960
And the question is why is this? And you think, well, it must have evolved that way because

335
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:46,600
some need for it to be like the real world. But in neural theories, there's a problem.

336
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:53,160
Because neural computation in the brain, the classical neural model, is classical dynamics,

337
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:59,240
not quantum physics, and is local. And so consciousness is a non physical, non local

338
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:06,200
effect, and they don't have any effect on neurons firing. So the result is that consciousness in

339
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:13,000
a neural theory has no causal effect on fitness. That means there's no selection pressure on it

340
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,520
to make it the way it is. So in a neural theory of consciousness, we're driven to this slightly

341
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:22,920
awkward conclusion that the special form of consciousness that we have is just a bit of

342
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:28,600
an accident. That seems very unlikely. Whereas in the projective wave theory,

343
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:33,320
there is a good evolutionary reason for consciousness being like it is. That is that

344
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:40,200
3D spatial cognition is very important. Wave is an essential part of it. So the wave has been

345
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:45,240
shaped by evolution. And it's been shaped to be just like the real world, because that's the best

346
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:51,640
way of controlling. So consciousness then is determined by the wave. And that means consciousness

347
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:57,080
has evolved to be like that. So the wave theory solves another problem there.

348
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:04,200
Finally, the unity of consciousness. You may ask this question occasionally, why do I only have

349
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:09,720
one consciousness and not several parallel consciousnesses? And this also is something

350
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:14,360
with difficulty neural theories, because we have plenty of neurons in the brain to have many

351
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:20,600
parallel consciousnesses. And brains can do some things in massive parallelism. And if we had

352
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:25,640
multiple parallel consciousness, it might be useful, for instance, for parallel planning of

353
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:32,040
action to see which one works. That's a difficulty for neural theories. The wave theory doesn't

354
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:36,840
have this difficulty because it accounts for the unity of consciousness. There's only one wave in

355
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:41,480
the brain. That is the source of consciousness. So there can only be one consciousness.

356
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:51,560
I think I'm on to the last slide now, pretty much the last slide. If this theory is taken

357
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:56,040
serious, it makes consciousness into a scientific problem rather than a philosophical problem.

358
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:02,120
Because a wave in the brain, if a wave in the brain is the key to understanding consciousness,

359
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:07,480
well, if there's no wave, then this theory is wrong. Get about it. If there is a wave,

360
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:12,920
I think there are very strong reasons to link it to consciousness, because it has such a good fit

361
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:18,520
to consciousness. So whether or not the wave exists, that's a scientific question. It's not a

362
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:23,560
question for philosophy. And I think there's a good prospect of answering it in the next 10 years.

363
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:28,120
So in 10 years time, either this theory will be the only theory of consciousness,

364
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:31,480
or it will be wrong and forgotten. I think that's a virtue and a theory.

365
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:42,200
So finally, last slide on the hard problem, David Chalmers' hard problem. The

366
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:48,360
predicted wave theory doesn't solve that problem. What I'd say about that is all

367
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:52,440
science has hard problems. There is the hard problem of consciousness. Why is consciousness

368
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:58,040
and link to matter? There are hard problems in physics, like what is space-time, or what is the

369
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:04,600
most fundamental particle? Or the hard problem of cosmology, why is there a universe? So hard

370
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:11,160
problems just don't have an answer. Scientists will like children keeping asking why, say why this,

371
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:17,160
why that. And we can go on asking why for as long as we like. So for instance, for fundamental

372
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:21,720
particles, we thought there was matter, we thought there were atoms, we got to protons,

373
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:26,760
we got to quarks, and we keep going on and we'll never get the final answer. But we still do science.

374
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:35,720
So I'm not too worried about the hard problem, consciousness. So that is all, and I've just

375
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:39,880
laid out a few questions or might want to discuss in the remaining time.

376
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:46,840
Maybe you could share your slide again so we can see the question if you have them on the slide.

377
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:53,880
Sorry, is it not sharing now? I see the slide still. Yeah, so you can leave it, maybe check

378
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:59,320
your view, David. And then you can leave that up and we can have a panel discussion.

379
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:11,880
Well, thanks a lot. Those who are here can, and Carl and David, please feel free to comment.

380
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:18,520
And also people will write some questions in the chat and I'll read one in if you pause. But

381
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:23,320
anyone here who'd like to give a reflection or any comments, that would be awesome.

382
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:33,960
Could I go ahead? Can you hear me? So if I may, I basically agree with what you say about the

383
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:38,280
hard problem, just to take the very last thing that you mentioned about the hard problem. And

384
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:44,760
this is why earlier on when you said that you had kind of a list of sort of, you know,

385
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:51,240
the idea of the Bayesian balance for theories of consciousness, and you mentioned the existence

386
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:59,960
of consciousness as itself, something that might be a problem for all neuronal theories of consciousness.

387
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:05,960
I think you did that on the slide too. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, so I agree. I think it's a problem for any

388
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:13,240
theory of consciousness, even the kind of more metaphysical theories that people who reflect

389
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:18,120
like Chalmers and others, panpsychists who reflect on the hard problem a certain way

390
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:25,480
end up with, you can actually raise the same set of questions for them. So there's really no progress

391
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:31,240
there, in my opinion. So in other words, if you take the hard problem as a kind of indication

392
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:39,000
that, well, consciousness couldn't be physical, or, or either that, or the physical world itself

393
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:44,440
must just be consciousness, which is kind of the two directions they go there. I think that's kind

394
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:52,920
of misguided. I mean, we, we have to sort of accept that our ability to penetrate, you know,

395
00:43:52,920 --> 00:44:02,200
cognitively, a priori into the nature of the cosmos is, is limited. So our, the best we can do is

396
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:09,560
make models and, you know, based on the phenomenology and try to arrive at a model that would give us

397
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:19,960
some kind of neural or physical, to speak more broadly, physical, testable, you know,

398
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:24,680
hypothesis, hypotheses we can test about the physical world, what we think realizes consciousness.

399
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:30,760
And it seems to me like that's exactly what you're doing. And that's what I would think is, is right

400
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:41,480
too. But I did want to ask you, when you say that no neurons are linked to consciousness in your own

401
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:49,640
model, do you mean, maybe I just don't understand exactly, but they're not linked directly to

402
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:56,200
consciousness. Okay. But there's some involved in the realization of the wave. Is that Oh,

403
00:44:56,200 --> 00:45:00,920
they are absolutely, they're controlling the wave, they're setting up the wave. They're all

404
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:06,440
on the cortex, they're using sense data to, to fix the wave. And it's the wave that makes consciousness.

405
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:16,680
Okay. And on the issue of unity, well, so suppose we identify this type of wave. I mean, it's at

406
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:23,560
least, you know, conceivable that we would find multiple such waves. Would you can see

407
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:27,480
well, I think the evidence in the thalamus and the central body is one way.

408
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:33,000
Okay. And I think one way is what you need to understand one space around you.

409
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:44,600
Okay. So, but if you found multiple such waves, would you be an issue? Yeah, okay. Well, I mean,

410
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:50,440
would you conclude that there must be multiple consciousnesses, then in a single brain? Or

411
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:55,640
would you, would you think that the theory is wrong? No, I would have a selection problem,

412
00:45:55,640 --> 00:46:00,120
just like neuron theories have a selection problem, selecting neurons. I'd have a problem

413
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:07,560
selecting which wave is conscious. I see. Rather than conclude that there are multiple.

414
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:13,640
You want to avoid that. My experience is I don't have multiple consciousnesses. Yes.

415
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:19,720
Right. But that might just be because only one of them gets to report.

416
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:26,280
Yeah, absolutely. No, like, like the way they, you know, I know it's debatable, but the way they

417
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:35,480
often interpreted the split brain cases coming out of. Yeah, good question. Good question. I mean,

418
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:41,560
I say one wave, but we have two thalamus. So the assumption there is that those waves are linked

419
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:48,920
and perhaps in split brain, they don't get linked. Okay. I think two thalamus have one wave in them,

420
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:55,400
that's a detail. I see. And then when it comes to the kind of wave, like,

421
00:46:56,840 --> 00:47:03,560
so you don't think it's an electromagnetic wave, you think it might be a Bose-Einstein

422
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:09,480
condensate. That's a hypothesis, I think, that Karen Smith once flowed. It's been around for some

423
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:15,880
years. Yeah. Alexander Karen Smith in the book. That's the, yeah, not the book on the origin,

424
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:21,160
the famous book on the origin of life, but he wrote a book on consciousness back in the 90s,

425
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:27,240
I think. Yeah, there was Michael Lockwood as well in the 80s, I think. It's a long history.

426
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:35,080
Okay. So how, when you say that you think we'll be able to probe this within the next 10 years,

427
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:42,040
I mean, could you sort of sketch how that might go, how we might be able to. Yeah. I mean, just,

428
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:47,400
this is not, this is probing the idea of the wave. Right. As I say, I think there are those three

429
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:52,680
pieces of, there's neural models that you can't build decent neural models. There is the thalamus

430
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:58,200
and there is the insect central body. I think we can go further on each one of those. We can test

431
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:03,720
them. We can test the thalamus ideas much better using connectome data. We can test the central

432
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:09,080
body using connectome data. And we can test the computational models by just trying to build them

433
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:15,960
and see if we get in. So there is science to be done to falsify this hypothesis and it may

434
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:26,600
succeed in falsifying it. Okay. But how would you measure such condensate? I mean, if you want to

435
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:32,520
be able to demonstrate the existence of the problem. Ideally, you'd like to actually directly

436
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:39,560
detect it. I think it's a bit like when Pauli in the 1930s predicted the neutrino. He thought it's

437
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:44,840
absolutely impossible to detect neutrinos. And it took 25 years to find it. And I think it'll take

438
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:50,200
a long time to really find this wave in the brain, because it's very low intensity, probably,

439
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:53,960
and because we just don't know how to look for it. And I think we have to do the biophysics

440
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:59,400
until we have a convincing case for eyes, this kind of wave, and then we can build a detector.

441
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:04,840
But until then, I think we won't detect it like neutrino or like dark matter.

442
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:08,760
Similar thing predicted theoretically years ago, but still not detected.

443
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,640
I'll read a question from the live chat.

444
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:29,720
Okay. Andrea Val wrote, thanks for sharing such interesting ideas. I wonder how the

445
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:36,440
PCM or 3D model can explain or deal with the un slash consciousness of emotions.

446
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:42,600
So where is affectant such in this kind of spatialized model?

447
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:46,200
Yeah. So maybe you want to join the PCM first, David?

448
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:56,680
If it's okay, Robert, maybe you have read some recent work on that, but I have a specific

449
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:00,840
answer to that question. Yeah, you go first.

450
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:07,720
Yeah, sorry about that. Well, one of the things that we realized working with that

451
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:14,680
particular geometry is it transform information in the sense of information in space. You can

452
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:19,080
think about distribution in space, for instance, that are going to be changed by projective

453
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:25,560
transformation in a manner that affect directly entropy. So if something is very far,

454
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:29,160
you know, and you have some uncertainty about the localization of these things,

455
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:34,840
so there is a probability function that represent that uncertainty about the localization

456
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:40,360
of that thing. And there is only one thing in your field of consciousness to simplify the problem.

457
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:47,720
Then the entropy of the whole space, if you consider the whole 3D space and some

458
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:57,240
scalar on it that would represent probabilities is very small. Whereas when you get closer,

459
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:02,440
for instance, by imagination, the projective transformation that anticipates action,

460
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:07,800
you get the object closer and you transform also the information, the variance, if you wish,

461
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:12,840
of your distribution, so it becomes broader. So the entropy increase, actually,

462
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:17,320
as an effect of projective transformation on the distribution of information.

463
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:26,520
So how does that relate to emotion? What we realized is that it can account for some

464
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:32,680
drives that are related to exploration or exploratory behavior or search behavior

465
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:41,320
to reduce uncertainty or maximize information. And that just does that. So basically,

466
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:49,480
the projective transformation by in virtue of making probabilities function in space

467
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:57,960
change their shape as a function of perspective taking, if you wish, until or induce a drive

468
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:07,080
to approach or avoid things or in this context to approach behavior either through imagination

469
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:13,400
or through actual behavior because that will maximize information by increasing entropy

470
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:17,880
of the object and you have more details. So that's something that we wrote a paper that is

471
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:24,600
currently under review in biological cybernetics about that with Gregor Sergent-Pertu as first

472
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:31,080
author with a bright mathematician and we can do a demonstration and actually direct theorems about

473
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:37,240
that and also simulations that show interesting behaviors that depend on projective parameters

474
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:42,520
that will show that the behavior of the agent, depending on the parameter, will be more focused.

475
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:47,640
So they will tend to always approach one object because they are driven by this anticipation

476
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:54,600
of increasing information through projective transformation. But with other parameters or

477
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:58,760
values of the parameters on the contrary, they start now oscillating between objects.

478
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:05,400
They start losing focus as if they were kind of ADHD. So there is a deep link between let's say

479
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:15,080
the evaluation of space, the appraisal of space, the drives that are that unfold from this information

480
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:22,520
and the behaviors that you have, for instance, approaching and that geometry, that very geometry

481
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:27,480
we are talking about yield, that type of thing. So here we are talking about what is typically

482
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:34,200
described as epistemic emotion, basically curiosity. So we have natural curiosity and part of it

483
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:41,000
that drives behaviors is a result of the very geometry that represents information and appraisal

484
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:45,800
according to that theory. I cannot enter into the detail on that, but you can also look on

485
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:54,120
papers that we wrote in what was that 2022 in the Journal of Theoretical Biology in which we use

486
00:53:54,120 --> 00:54:01,400
little robots to demonstrate adaptive and maladaptive behaviors with principles also derived

487
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:08,680
from the geometry and the free energy principle or something equivalent to get a wealth of

488
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:17,560
affective behavior of approach avoidance, but also social cognition. We can kind of

489
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:25,960
simulate social anxiety. We obtain joint attention behavior as a result of mutual perspective taking

490
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:33,000
and there are a lot of things we could account that we can use in this model and in this framework

491
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:37,960
to account for emotion. There is a lot of work ahead, but we believe that there is and we have

492
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:42,920
good reason to believe there is a deep link between space and emotion that's actually called

493
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:49,560
aesthetics that consciousness is a form of aesthetics where space and emotion are untangled

494
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:56,440
and that we can fairly well account for many phenomena that relate to emotion and behavior

495
00:54:57,080 --> 00:55:00,200
through this model, but that's sorry for the long talk.

496
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:07,400
That's great. Shall I give my final answer? It's very much along the same lines that

497
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:17,560
emotion and space are deeply linked. In the wave model, I mean the model of space contains all

498
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:23,880
of space, the external space and the internal space of the body and an important part of emotions is

499
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:28,600
feelings in the body and they are part of your conscious awareness, part of the

500
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:37,560
wave model or projection model just like the others. Basically, the PW theory and I think the

501
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:45,480
PCM says all consciousness is spatial. We have qualia, but they exist in space. You hear words,

502
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:49,800
you experience colors, you experience all of those and you experience feelings,

503
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:55,400
all of them in space. If you look at all the components of emotion, human emotion for instance,

504
00:55:55,400 --> 00:56:01,320
the words we say to ourselves and the feelings we have in our bodies, they are all represented in

505
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:09,320
that conscious space. Human emotion is a complex story which perhaps we don't want to go into,

506
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:13,640
but basically it comes down to the way we experience it is in that model of space.

507
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:23,560
And if I may, I would have that if you take the standpoint of pure phenomenology and you ask yourself

508
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:29,080
when I experience an emotion, for instance deep anxiety or fear, something very intense that is

509
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:35,960
very salient, you can ask yourself how much of that phenomenology of that experience is actually

510
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:43,240
quote-unquote reducible to some spatial experience. For instance, the experience of the body with the

511
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:49,080
heart that starts pounding in your chest and you feel it stronger, your lungs that change,

512
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:54,920
you breathe faster for instance and you can feel that movement in your body and all of that is

513
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:59,880
spatial. What you feel in your gut or your intestine gets kind of stretched or whatever,

514
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:06,120
we have metaphors, but actually a lot of the details of the phenomenology of emotion or feelings,

515
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:13,080
let's say, I believe is actually spatial, but it's overlooked. People don't think about it.

516
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:18,520
But in particular, about body awareness, there is a lot of spatial stuff going on here.

517
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:26,680
Yeah, I agree. Mindful meditation, talk a lot about space and talk a lot about the body.

518
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:29,000
I think they put emotion in the right place.

519
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:41,560
Carl or Ken, want to add anything or I can look for another question in the live chat.

520
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:57,640
Well, I have one question. So I mean, your current hypothesis is that this wave is

521
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:04,600
realized in the thalamus. Is that right? That's right. Yeah. Okay. So that's sort of

522
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:12,520
would, you know, there's this kind of debate about whether or not consciousness is cortical

523
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:19,800
or subcortical. So this would definitely be on the subcortical side. I think there's a lot of

524
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:24,040
sense in the global workspace theory and they were talking originally about a workspace involving

525
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:29,880
the thalamus and the cortex. I think it's the consciousness really comes from the thalamus

526
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:38,040
integrating all that spatial information. So it is down. So the follow up, but yeah, that's fine

527
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:44,040
with me, frankly. But the follow up question is, well, it's not exactly a follow up to that. It's

528
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:50,600
more a general question about your way of thinking about it. How, I mean, I know maybe you can't

529
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:56,680
really answer this until we have a more specific hypothesis about exactly what kind of wave it is,

530
00:58:56,680 --> 00:59:05,640
but could you say something generally about how the wave integrates with or what's the right way

531
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:13,320
to put it, use it, recruits and, you know, the kind of computational apparatus of the brain

532
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:19,640
so that, you know, you end up, you decide to, oh, I'm going to reach out, you know,

533
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:28,200
yay far and grab this bottle. How does the, how does, you know, computationally speaking,

534
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:34,120
how does the wave integrate? Yeah, I think that's a very good question and could have a very long

535
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:41,320
answer. But basically, the wave integrates information from all the sense data. So from

536
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:47,480
your hands, from your ears, from your eyes, all that information goes through the cortex and cortex

537
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:54,440
decides where it's coming from and broadcast signals back to the thalamus and the thalamus wave

538
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:59,320
integrates all those signals together to produce the Bayesian best model of what's happening at

539
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:07,000
this moment based on touch, proprioception, hearing, sound, hearing, vision and so on. So the

540
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:13,800
computation, it's an integration of many sorts of information, possibly in a cycle between the

541
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:24,760
thalamus and the cortex. Okay, but if you need to, you know, for example, program and action,

542
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:31,320
so you've, that's kind of the, you got your sensory, the integration of all your sensory

543
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:36,920
information, now you need to program and action. How do, and maybe this is just my ignorance,

544
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:45,000
how do waves, how can waves be used in a way to generate programming of an action and then give

545
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:50,600
it back to your neurons? I mean, I've only got beginnings of answers to that. But basically,

546
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:56,120
wave is very good for representing 3D geometry and for calculating displacements. I know where

547
01:00:56,120 --> 01:01:01,240
my hand is, I know where my coffee cup is, so the wave helps me calculate the displacement,

548
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:05,960
which way I have to move my hand to pick up the coffee cup. So it's that kind of spatial

549
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:09,560
calculation that the wave is always helping us do, just to move our limbs.

550
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:19,400
I have a follow-up question on that, if I may. Ken, do you mind?

551
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:20,920
Yeah, no, go ahead, go ahead.

552
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:27,640
You invoked earlier Fourier transform and inverse Fourier transform, so at least 3D Fourier transform

553
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:32,920
and inverse Fourier transform, in order to do the encoding and decoding to, you know,

554
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:39,720
go move from the wave to the neural substrates back and forth. Of course, as you know,

555
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:49,400
there is a limit in resolution. When you do a Fourier transform, you have the uncertainty

556
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:57,640
principle that rules the initial resolution that we can have. Of course, it depends on the

557
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:03,080
number of samples. I mean, there are a lot of arithmetics behind it. It can be more and more

558
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:12,680
precise as you have more and more bits of encoding, if you wish. So you said that classical

559
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:21,960
neural theories like build upon substrates that lack enough precision in spatial resolution,

560
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:28,200
for instance, to account for our experience. Would you think that in the context of a wave theory,

561
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:35,000
the type of uncertainty principle that are attached to it, could cause a problem of resolution too,

562
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:40,920
or that it's the granularity? There is a problem, yeah. There is a problem of resolution.

563
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:45,560
I alluded to it in the slides. That is that if you've got a minimum wavelength lambda

564
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:51,960
and a diameter of the sphere D, the maximum precision is lambda over D, and that can't

565
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:58,040
be infinite precision. So that's the uncertainty principle. But the idea of the Fourier transform

566
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:03,960
is not that something in the brain does a Fourier transform. It is the fundamental bridging law for

567
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:09,720
consciousness does the Fourier transform. It says that consciousness is a Fourier transform of the

568
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:17,400
wave, full stop. Fourier transform is there in fundamental laws of nature, like quantum mechanics,

569
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:22,440
for instance. So it's saying this is a fundamental law of nature, just like quantum mechanics says

570
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:29,880
momentum is a Fourier transform position. So the bridging law for consciousness says

571
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:33,800
the form of consciousness is a Fourier transform of the wave.

572
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:43,960
I'll make a short comment, or Carl, do you want to?

573
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:55,320
After you. Okay. So thank you for the presentation, and it's really interesting on many levels.

574
01:03:55,320 --> 01:04:01,160
First, you and the paper goes into more detail on this. You lay out what your priors are,

575
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:07,640
and kind of the dependency structure to actually reach at least an estimate of probabilities,

576
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:11,480
which is it's really interesting. It gives a lot of opportunities for people to dig in

577
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:16,200
and say, yeah, I think that's 10% likely or no, it's a zero. This is not possible and kind of

578
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:24,280
close off a branch of inquiry. And also this discussion here about the algorithmic and the

579
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:31,400
substrate realization interaction with the substrate, and even this poly computation idea of

580
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:36,520
the observer's model of what's happening in a process, and kind of like the dark matter there,

581
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:41,400
like the observer might suggest that there's a cryptographic process, though they couldn't

582
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:46,840
decode it. And then that would have an entropy distribution that wouldn't be distinguishable

583
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:53,000
in the absence of the decryption from a noise, but it would be like still a hypothesis kept alive.

584
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:59,560
And you could say, I think it's a 1% chance of this being the case. One thought is how

585
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:08,120
high precision really is the spatial generative model in that there could be visual upscaling?

586
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:14,840
We know there's attention play to make the periphery look sharp and have color vision.

587
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:21,320
And so it's possible that especially for like distant objects, small objects that they could be

588
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:29,560
bundled and just seen as a assembly, as a larger object, if they're touching like the car body

589
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:37,800
and the wheel, and then the same way that in the periphery, color and visual attention seem to give

590
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:44,120
this extreme like, wow, that's like exactly this angle. If you were to go over there with a protractor,

591
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:49,560
but that could be as we're sort of seeing with diffusion and generative AI models,

592
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:59,240
that could be quite a low resolution structural inference followed by a just compatible visual

593
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:08,360
realization. And then just last comment, really interesting to explore, how does evolution

594
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:15,320
and intergenerational change shape the substrate that the sense data wash over so that non-stationary

595
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:21,000
stable states, whether they're rate encoding of neuron, whether glial, electro,

596
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:27,480
and all these other even potentially more exotic options, how are those stabilized?

597
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:36,520
Wow. I mean, those are real questions to investigate, particularly the precision of our

598
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:42,680
conscious experience and how much is quotes and illusion. But I personally think that if you look

599
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:47,720
at something which is a straight line, you experience it as a straight line with some kind

600
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:54,920
of precision that's of the order of 1%, a deviation of 1% from a straight line would show. And so

601
01:06:54,920 --> 01:07:03,160
that's a lower bound on the precision of your model. But again, there can be lots of discussion

602
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:14,200
about this. Yeah, interesting. Karl, any thoughts?

603
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:26,200
Well, just a few sort of practical and specific questions. So the nature of this wave, if I wanted

604
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:31,160
to model it, I mean, are we talking about a standing wave? Are we talking about a soliton?

605
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:37,800
Are we talking about spherical harmonics on the surface of the thalamus? Are we talking about

606
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:47,160
what kind of basis might I use for this kind of wave, even before asking questions about what

607
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:52,440
the wave amplitude actually means? So what's the functional mathematical form of this way?

608
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:59,560
Very good questions, whether it's a standing wave or a moving wave. I don't know. The nice

609
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:07,720
thing about a Bose-Einstein condensate is that it acts like a long-lived quantum mechanical

610
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:15,560
wave function. In other words, it has phase which can be detected, and it preserves phase for long

611
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:21,960
times. And the wave might have to preserve phase in order to represent positions. If you have a

612
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:27,720
standing wave like cos theta in some direction in this sphere, then there's an ambiguity. It

613
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:33,320
represents plus a direction and the minus direction and what happens to the minus direction. So

614
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:38,840
I would rather have phase in the wave like a Bose-Einstein condensate, but they're very

615
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:43,400
deep questions and I don't do the answers. I mean, we could start modelling and see what happens.

616
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:52,520
Just propose some answers. Basically, you just need a spherical volume that holds a wave

617
01:08:52,520 --> 01:09:00,120
excitation with a certain maximum wave vector, and we could try out standing waves, moving waves,

618
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:13,400
and so on. What would differentiate a condensate from a formulation in terms of a time-dependent

619
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:22,200
floating wave equation? Well, I think your time-dependent floating wave, as everybody knows,

620
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:28,360
the problem with quantum in the brain is that decoherence smashes it in 10 to the minus 20 seconds,

621
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:33,640
but that doesn't happen to a Bose-Einstein condensate. A Bose-Einstein condensate is a long-lived quantum

622
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:41,960
state, and so that's an ordinary floating equation. Decoherence is going to smash you in no time at

623
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:46,600
all unless you have some incredibly clever insulation like in a quantum computer.

624
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:55,960
Right. I mean, lifting from the microscopic to the macroscopic, I mean, that would suggest

625
01:09:55,960 --> 01:10:02,680
that you need very, very low temperatures thermodynamically speaking. No one has observed

626
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:08,760
a BC at room temperature yet, but we've got close, and the idea is that nature might be cleverer than

627
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:18,600
we are. One angle, perhaps from the quantum FEP from Carl and Chris Fields and others is,

628
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:26,760
and what I heard in the basis set question, Carl, was this brain region that hosts the

629
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:35,000
functionality or the core aspect of the functionality, like one option is it is like the wave is

630
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:42,040
represented inside of that sphere. Like just, there's probably multiple ways even that could

631
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:47,720
happen, but it's like a little reconstruction wave, but symbolized. Another option would be,

632
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:54,760
like a holograph, the representation space is encoded on the interface of that region with

633
01:10:54,760 --> 01:11:04,040
other regions, and so that kind of surface is maintained and stabilized and has information

634
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:09,960
flowing through it. And then there wouldn't necessarily be something in the middle, but it'd

635
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:17,160
be more like a ripple on a surface, which was the basis set question. Daniel, that is very

636
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:23,480
interesting because in the thalamus, there is the thalamic reticular nucleus, TRN, which is a thin

637
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:29,160
skin around the surface of the thalamus. And you could just say that is holding the surface wave.

638
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:33,880
And the wave is projected inside from the surface.

639
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:46,440
It would be useful to engage Chris Fields here. There are two very distinct uses of the word

640
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:54,120
holographic here. You could be referring to the holographic principle, whereby all the information

641
01:11:54,120 --> 01:12:02,920
on the bulk, on the inside, say, of the thalamus was on the surface, on the reticular nucleus

642
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:11,640
of the thalamus, for example, or just on the surface in one sense. And that is what the rest

643
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:19,800
of the brain sees and possibly consciousness sees. But that's a very different use of the notion of

644
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:27,880
a holographic projection using constructive and destructive interference to encode things.

645
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:35,480
So Daniel, you're absolutely right. My question was really searching to distinguish,

646
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:43,320
are we talking about a wave function in the thalamus? Are we talking about

647
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:51,640
application of the holographic principle to the classical information on the surface

648
01:12:52,760 --> 01:13:00,680
of some bulk that was the thalamus? And you could then argue, if you wanted to, that the bulk,

649
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:04,920
which can never be observed from the outside, unless you are the thalamus, you never know what's

650
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:12,920
happening on the inside. You could only observe what's on the surface. That would be a different

651
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:21,960
notion of a wave theory that would certainly be consistent with quantum information theory

652
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:29,480
and also consistent with Chris Fields in a screen hypothesis that could be

653
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:39,080
spatialized and endowed with, in virtue of the fact that on the holographic screen itself,

654
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:45,160
on the surface, there can only be classical information and that information can now be

655
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:54,440
cast in terms of classical Bayesian inference. But it also relates to, I repeat to Chris Fields,

656
01:13:54,440 --> 01:14:01,960
in a screen hypothesis, which is, if you like, taking quantum information,

657
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:09,240
theoretic principles and trying to apply them to consciousness, that eludes the problem of

658
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:20,760
applying quantum mechanics that is only relevant at the very small scale, for very precise or

659
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:30,280
low temperature systems. If you want to apply that kind of maths to macroscopic phenomena,

660
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:35,160
then you have to apply it in a scale invariant context and I think quantum information theory

661
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:39,320
would certainly do that. So, Daniel, yes, I was exactly trying to probe.

662
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:56,520
Is PW red? The Bose-Einstein condensate variant or alternative version of the projective wave

663
01:14:57,480 --> 01:15:10,920
is that committed to quantum mechanics or is it really an expression of condensate-like dynamics

664
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:18,120
in the context of quantum information theory? And if it is, does it live on a holographic screen

665
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:23,240
or does it live in the bulk? And if it lives in the bulk, what are these wave functions over?

666
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:26,360
So, these are the practical questions I was trying to get out.

667
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:33,240
Very interesting questions and it's all to play for. I have an open mind about them, but

668
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:40,760
my feeling is that the BEC is a way of getting past this decoherence argument from

669
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:51,960
Tickmark others that neurons have to be classical. And the BEC, it does work very well as a memory.

670
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:57,640
That's the practical point of it. Working memory, I think, is what you need for space.

671
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:08,600
Awesome. Perhaps each can give a last round of thought. Where do they feel this takes them

672
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:15,880
or what are they looking forward to and can then David and then Carl and then Robert?

673
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:24,200
Yeah, I don't have anything new to add. I find this really interesting and I remember

674
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:32,360
reading Karen Smith's book kind of arguing that Bose-Einstein condensates might be

675
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:39,480
important for understanding consciousness and thinking that among the quantum mechanical

676
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:50,280
hypotheses, I like that one the best. I said earlier, I just sort of have this kind of bias,

677
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:59,000
but I'm totally willing to be talked out of it. I don't want to go into the details, but

678
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:07,560
I think Karen Smith's concern was about the unity of consciousness primarily and also kind of made

679
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:17,960
the case that as you were suggesting that maybe as you put it, nature is cleverer than we are

680
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:24,920
and there's some way to realize that Bose-Einstein condenses it in the brain without the decoherence

681
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:34,280
issue. But anyway, just to say this is all very, very fascinating to me and I am happy to continue

682
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:46,120
the discussion next week, right? Isn't it next week? Thank you, Ken. And from my part, yes,

683
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:54,040
I'm also looking forward to continuations of the discussion. My direction of questioning

684
01:17:54,040 --> 01:18:00,120
will be something on the lines that I think both Karen and David alluded to which is the

685
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:11,880
the link between spatial waves in the brain and the projective geometry that they speak to

686
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:19,480
and the information geometry that underwrites belief updating and the Bayesian mechanics that

687
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:26,120
inherit from the free energy principle, being it classical mechanics, the classical information

688
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:37,080
processing or looking at using quantum information theory to read belief updating.

689
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:42,520
I'm not sure I'm going to get any answers, but that's what I'm interested in hearing more about

690
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:46,200
and the process. If you haven't talked about mortal computation yet, so we need to talk about

691
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:54,360
mortal computation. Oh, yes. David, any last thoughts? Well, the thought of a

692
01:18:56,360 --> 01:19:02,680
of a man who is 15 now and feels that the more he learns, the less he knows. So it was predicted

693
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:10,920
in all the books I had read in my years. And so I'm whole opened to that complex universe. I certainly

694
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:18,040
believe that nature is clever than I am for sure. And I find that fascinating. I like the rationale.

695
01:19:18,040 --> 01:19:22,520
It's not like, you know, there is a lot of stuff about quantum mechanics and the brain

696
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:27,240
and consciousness that to me has always sounded wishy-washy, if not completely wacko.

697
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:36,120
But I came back a bit from that. I had a lot of like Ken priors, negative priors about it.

698
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:43,080
I remember once in Tucson, Arizona, at the famous conference about the science of consciousness,

699
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:47,400
there were this bunch of guys who called themselves, they were German, the quantum

700
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:51,880
consciousness Academy, and they were all dressed in black and they are all, you know, headset and

701
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:57,480
microphone like that. And they were like speaking nonsense as like a cult. But I found that very

702
01:19:57,480 --> 01:20:03,400
fascinated because I used to like very fascinating. So I used to like this conference back in the day

703
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:08,680
when it was very psychedelic. But that was kind of, you know, and I come back to that because

704
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:15,720
my ignorance, I'm becoming aware more and more of my own ignorance. I say, well, why not? And

705
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:21,480
definitely I think that maybe Carl can try to do that. If we could get Chris Field in the next

706
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:27,400
core role, he would certainly be among us, the most competent. I tried to get Grégoire Sergent

707
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:33,960
to the core, but he was not available. He's a very bright mathematician and he master quantum

708
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:39,960
mechanics like, like if it was, you know, I don't know, it's nothing for him. Or Daniel Benka would

709
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:44,520
be the best also is Grégoire. But I'm afraid I won't be able to have them here. But I think it

710
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:49,320
would be very useful to have some people like that who definitely know more than me about those

711
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:54,840
things. And Chris might be interested to join. I don't know, Carl. But looking forward to the next

712
01:20:55,400 --> 01:21:02,920
to the next discussion, one correction, they were Swiss, David, they weren't, they weren't, they

713
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:11,880
weren't, they were Swiss, they were Swiss black, I think. Yes, they kind of look like people from

714
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:17,800
the matrix. They were Swiss. They were not German. They were Swiss. And they had, they had a leader

715
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:21,720
they were always in contact with. Super hot.

716
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:31,240
Wow. Okay. Yeah, please, Robert, and, and, and we'll contact Chris.

717
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:41,320
That's been really fascinating. I think the virtue of this theory is that it is falsifiable.

718
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:47,480
In other words, if there's no way in the brain, forget it, this theory is wrong. And that's exactly

719
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:52,840
the question we're going to be looking at next week. I look forward to having your contributions.

720
01:21:54,840 --> 01:22:07,400
Awesome. Thank you all. See you at 16 UTC on July 29th. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Bye.
