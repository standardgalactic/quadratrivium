Hello and welcome, everyone. This is Physics as Information Processing, Session 4 on Communicating

00:14.080 --> 00:20.960
Observers. It's the 10th of August 2023. Chris, looking forward to this lecture off to you.

00:23.520 --> 00:26.320
Thank you, Daniel, and welcome to this session.

00:27.280 --> 00:32.480
As Daniel said, this is about communicating observers and fastening your seatbelts,

00:32.480 --> 00:35.200
because we have a lot to cover in the next hour.

00:36.880 --> 00:43.440
So just to do a quick review, we've been talking about quantum information theory,

00:43.440 --> 00:51.200
and we've been talking about it in the simplest possible setting of two systems, Alice and Bob,

00:51.920 --> 00:55.440
that exchange information through their mutual boundary.

00:56.320 --> 01:01.920
And we've assumed that everything is finite dimensional, so we don't need to worry about

01:01.920 --> 01:08.320
infinite energy transfer across this boundary. And of course, we assume conservation of energy,

01:08.320 --> 01:13.520
so there are no sources or sinks in either of the systems Alice and Bob.

01:14.240 --> 01:21.040
And we emphasize that this way of depicting things as topological, we're not assuming any

01:21.040 --> 01:26.400
background geometry, no sort of spatial embedding, which is going to become very important in this

01:26.400 --> 01:35.360
session. In the last session, we talked about how the boundary, which I'll always call B,

01:36.400 --> 01:42.720
it can be thought of as a channel that comprises in qubits that are independent,

01:42.720 --> 01:50.320
and Alice and Bob each can prepare and measure those qubits. And they can always choose

01:50.320 --> 01:56.240
independently their reference frames for doing so, so how they define up and down when they're

01:56.240 --> 02:03.920
measuring a spin with effectively a Z-spin operator to interact with these qubits.

02:05.760 --> 02:10.320
We talked a little bit about the free energy principle and its quantum formulation.

02:11.520 --> 02:17.360
And the principle basically says that interacting systems will behave in a way that aligns their

02:17.360 --> 02:22.800
reference frames and that they therefore asymptotically approach entanglement.

02:23.360 --> 02:30.320
So the FEP is a classical limit of the principle of uniterity. And that's one reason for studying

02:30.320 --> 02:37.280
quantum information to learn more about the FEP and so to learn more about active inference

02:37.280 --> 02:40.800
and what the theory of active inference says about agents.

02:40.800 --> 02:51.520
And last time we talked a lot about the constraints that are imposed by a limited free energy supply

02:51.520 --> 02:59.280
on any agent. Recall that we talked about the fact that in the absence of sources of free energy

03:01.680 --> 03:08.560
within an agent, so as long as you conserve energy globally, that the free energy that each

03:08.560 --> 03:15.680
agent uses has to come from its environment. That's clearly true for us. We have to consume oxygen

03:15.680 --> 03:23.200
and eat food and things like that to keep running as systems. And we discussed a little bit this

03:23.200 --> 03:32.000
theorem that if two reference frames or quantum processes Q1 and Q2 don't commute,

03:32.800 --> 03:37.920
they have to be implemented by compartments that communicate classically. And we'll use this

03:37.920 --> 03:45.200
extensively today. But the bottom line last time was that physics alone gives us compartmentalization

03:45.200 --> 03:51.680
in systems whenever the systems are complex enough to have multiple kinds of measurements that they

03:51.680 --> 04:03.360
can't deploy simultaneously. So where we're going, today we're going to start from this

04:03.360 --> 04:09.520
place we left off last time of the possibility of agents that are compartmentalized

04:10.640 --> 04:17.120
and into compartments that have to communicate classically. So we're going to talk about agents

04:17.120 --> 04:24.000
that can be compartmentalized into multiple subagents that share an environment, the environment

04:24.000 --> 04:30.480
consisting of Bob, and how those agents talk about that shared environment.

04:31.440 --> 04:38.240
So the motivation for this is simple. It's that what we do all the time is a group activity.

04:38.240 --> 04:43.440
And what we're doing right now is a group activity that involves sharing an environment,

04:43.440 --> 04:52.880
what's shown on this screen, and talking about it. And the whole post-session discussion process

04:53.520 --> 05:00.800
will be another example of just that sort of thing. So to talk about science at all, or to talk

05:00.800 --> 05:06.960
about any kind of social relations, or to talk about anything other than solipsism, we have to

05:06.960 --> 05:12.640
be able to talk about how multiple agents communicate about some shared environment.

05:13.600 --> 05:17.600
And so that's what we're going to develop a formal way of talking about.

05:17.600 --> 05:27.520
And there are two things to notice right off the top about this. One is that the way we've defined

05:27.520 --> 05:33.200
interactions of boundaries, they're effectively instantaneous. So each agent, remember,

05:34.080 --> 05:40.240
interacts with its boundary with some set of operators. And what those operators do is

05:40.240 --> 05:46.720
effectively measure, each operator effectively measures the spin of a cubic. So this is a very

05:46.720 --> 05:57.200
fast process. The other thing that we then need to notice is that if we have two agents,

05:58.720 --> 06:06.320
and they're communicating with each other classically, then they're going to be using degrees

06:06.320 --> 06:12.160
of freedom of their shared environment in order to communicate. And that's exactly what we're

06:12.160 --> 06:20.240
doing right now. For example, we're using degrees of freedom of the internet to communicate. I'm

06:20.240 --> 06:26.880
using degrees of freedom of the local atmosphere to talk to my microphone. And I'm using degrees of

06:26.880 --> 06:36.000
freedom of the local photon field to see my screen. So all communication between agents,

06:36.960 --> 06:39.920
and certainly all classical communication between agents,

06:40.560 --> 06:45.760
uses degrees of freedom of the environment. And the environment, remember, is the other system,

06:45.760 --> 06:52.480
Bob, that's on the other side of that shared boundary. So we're going to be interested in

06:52.480 --> 06:59.680
how components of Alice use Bob as a communication channel, and in fact, as multiple communication

06:59.760 --> 07:07.280
channels. And I just wanted to quote my colleague and friend, Mike Levin, in his statement that

07:07.280 --> 07:15.440
all intelligence is composite. All of us, all organisms, even single cells, are composite

07:15.440 --> 07:23.520
systems that comprise many, many different agents that are able to make different kinds of measurements

07:24.080 --> 07:29.040
and execute different kinds of actions, and so have to communicate classically.

07:30.080 --> 07:37.040
So we're talking about all of life here, as well as all of social systems and ecosystems,

07:37.040 --> 07:45.360
and such things as that. So the first thing I want to do today is simplify the notation

07:47.040 --> 07:52.160
so that we don't have to draw quite such complicated diagrams. So the picture on the left

07:52.160 --> 07:58.800
here is a picture from the last session. It shows the structure of a very simple agent that

08:00.000 --> 08:06.560
makes some measurements using a reference frame called E, and then writes some results of those

08:06.560 --> 08:13.440
measurements to memory using a reference frame called Y. And those two processes are connected

08:13.440 --> 08:21.840
by an internal clock that ticks between the input process and the output process. And the clock

08:21.840 --> 08:27.600
tick corresponds to the expenditure of free energy to write information irreversibly on the

08:27.600 --> 08:33.280
boundary. So the memories are actually written on the boundary because that's where classical

08:33.280 --> 08:40.160
information lives in this theory. So you can think of this whole process from E through the clock and

08:40.160 --> 08:47.840
back to Y as a single quantum process or as a quantum computation that maps some sector E of

08:47.840 --> 08:54.560
the boundary to some sector Y of the boundary. And so we can represent it in this much simpler way

08:54.560 --> 09:02.400
that's over on the right side as some process Q that maps some sector on the boundary to some

09:02.400 --> 09:09.920
other sector on the boundary. And formally, that process can be thought of as a topological quantum

09:09.920 --> 09:16.640
field theory. Topological here is important. It's not geometric. It doesn't assume an embedding

09:16.640 --> 09:24.400
in space. And this will become critically important later on. And the operation of that

09:26.320 --> 09:33.280
TQFT requires a clock tick, or it incorporates a tick of this internal clock.

09:34.480 --> 09:44.640
And we can do this because we were able to prove, Jim Glaceburg and Tonino Marchiano and I were

09:44.640 --> 09:51.040
able to prove last year, that we can always represent a quantum reference frame as a topological

09:51.040 --> 09:56.640
quantum field theory. And this just illustrates the two kinds of transformations between

09:57.680 --> 10:02.240
quantum reference frames that are important. We can take one and divide it into two pieces

10:02.240 --> 10:12.800
that commute, or we can take a two-part reference frame, and we can swap in

10:14.160 --> 10:20.320
another part that doesn't commute with the part that we've swapped it in for, but that does commute

10:20.320 --> 10:28.320
with the remainder of the reference frame. So here, R is the reference component of some object

10:28.320 --> 10:35.920
identification system. And we can swap in some different way of looking at the object

10:35.920 --> 10:42.320
once we've identified. So for example, if the object that we're identifying is a box that can

10:42.320 --> 10:51.280
measure both Z-spin and X-spin, then P and Q can be the Z-spin and X-spin settings on that box

10:52.080 --> 10:58.400
that allow us to effectively rotate the filter from this way to that way, so that we measure

10:59.040 --> 11:05.920
vertical spin versus horizontal spin. And that's really it. I mean, those are the ways that one

11:05.920 --> 11:12.320
can transform quantum reference frames. Of course, we can do arbitrarily many compositions of this

11:12.320 --> 11:18.080
kind of transformation to do something very complicated, but they map very simply to TQFTs

11:18.080 --> 11:25.120
with the structure, and you can construct categories out of this and find a fumpter that's

11:25.120 --> 11:32.000
well-defined that maps one category to another. So it's an example of the niches of categorical

11:32.000 --> 11:38.080
techniques for solving a problem that looks difficult, but in fact, it's very straightforward.

11:38.240 --> 11:47.360
So using this simplified notation, it becomes very easy to see

11:49.280 --> 11:54.560
that if we have two systems, Alice and Bob, on opposite sides of this boundary,

11:55.440 --> 12:03.760
and we perfectly align their quantum reference frames, which is what the FEP says they will

12:03.760 --> 12:12.560
tend to do, then they become entangled. And you can see that they're entangled by seeing that once

12:12.560 --> 12:19.680
the reference frames are perfectly aligned, they jointly implement one quantum process.

12:21.760 --> 12:29.040
And jointly implementing one quantum process just means you're entangled. The two sides no longer

12:29.040 --> 12:38.080
have conditionally independent states. If one quantum process, which is time reversible,

12:38.080 --> 12:46.960
information preserving, is implemented jointly by the two systems. So a lot of things like

12:46.960 --> 12:57.680
this become very simple when we think of these processes as just quantum computations going on

12:57.680 --> 13:05.680
inside some system implemented by some system and how those processes relate across some boundary.

13:06.320 --> 13:12.320
So that's what we're going to do for studying communication today.

13:14.400 --> 13:21.840
Another thing to recall from a couple of sessions ago, or last session, is that if two

13:22.480 --> 13:31.520
reference frames Q1 and Q2 commute, we can always join them together to form a single

13:31.520 --> 13:38.160
reference frame. And this is just a graphical depiction in this simpler language of how that works.

13:39.280 --> 13:46.800
And topologically, there's no distinction between the left side and the right side.

13:46.800 --> 13:51.520
What I've done is just squeeze the top two green circles together and the bottom two

13:51.520 --> 13:58.480
green circles together into one circle. And that just makes a simple process connecting

13:58.480 --> 14:04.320
the top one to the bottom one. So what we're going to be interested in is situations where this

14:04.320 --> 14:14.880
doesn't happen, where Alice consists of two components that execute reference frames that

14:14.880 --> 14:24.240
don't commute. And so the two components are conditionally independent. They do each have

14:24.240 --> 14:31.280
free choice of reference frame. And so they have to communicate classically. They don't share

14:33.520 --> 14:41.840
a single quantum process. So they're not entangled. And before we go ahead to do that,

14:42.560 --> 14:50.240
I just wanted to remind you of some of the no-go theorems that follow from this situation

14:51.280 --> 14:58.480
depicted on the right, where we have a single agent executing a single reference frame,

14:58.480 --> 15:05.840
a single process, a single kind of measurement, any set of commuting measurements that can be

15:05.840 --> 15:11.760
combined into one measurement. And here's some things Alice can't do. And we've talked about

15:11.760 --> 15:21.920
some of these previously. So this is basically a reminder. But Alice can't, using just one

15:21.920 --> 15:29.200
measurement, measure the entanglement entropy across her own boundary. So Alice can't know

15:29.200 --> 15:36.720
that she has an independent state. She can't know that she's not entangled with Bob. And that's a

15:36.720 --> 15:44.400
useful thing to think about philosophically, as it applies to you and me. We can't actually know

15:44.400 --> 15:52.560
that we have independent states. Alice can't measure her own entanglement entropy. So she

15:52.560 --> 15:57.360
can't know whether she has components that have to communicate classically.

15:59.680 --> 16:06.000
She can't measure Bob's entanglement entropy. So she can't know whether Bob has compartments

16:06.000 --> 16:11.120
that have to communicate classically. And if you think in terms of perception theory,

16:12.240 --> 16:18.400
this says Alice can't know whether Bob consists of separate objects that behave classically.

16:18.880 --> 16:27.440
Their behavior can look classical to her. But she's not able to determine that their

16:27.440 --> 16:32.640
behavior is classical because she can't measure Bob's entanglement entropy.

16:34.480 --> 16:42.080
She can't measure the dimension of her own boundary. And recall from a couple of times ago

16:42.160 --> 16:49.440
that the boundary includes some sector that supplies free energy that Alice can't extract

16:49.440 --> 16:54.080
information from for further processing. She can only extract free energy from.

16:55.040 --> 17:01.920
So she can't measure the dimension of that sector. And so she can't measure the dimension of the

17:01.920 --> 17:07.760
whole boundary itself. And this of course means that she can't measure her own dimension either.

17:07.760 --> 17:12.960
And of course she can't measure Bob's dimension because the only information she can get about

17:12.960 --> 17:18.480
Bob is the classical information that's encoded on this boundary. She can't reach past the boundary

17:18.480 --> 17:26.320
to see how large a system Bob is. And that's clearly connected to this first point that she

17:26.320 --> 17:31.760
can't measure the entanglement entropy across Bob because the entanglement entropy can only be small

17:32.480 --> 17:37.360
if her dimension and Bob's dimension are both much larger than the dimension of the boundary.

17:37.360 --> 17:45.360
So that's a condition she can't check. So all of these kind of no-go theorems lead off an interesting

17:45.360 --> 17:53.920
direction. And the only one that we're really going to be interested in here is the third one,

17:53.920 --> 17:59.520
the one about measuring Bob's entanglement entropy because we want to talk specifically about how

18:00.080 --> 18:07.600
multiple agents, so multiple components of Alice, can access information about Bob's entanglement

18:07.600 --> 18:19.360
entropy. Okay, so recall from the end of the last session that the last thing we talked about was

18:19.360 --> 18:26.240
classical communication. And we talked about the fact that classical communication involves

18:26.240 --> 18:31.280
assumptions and pitfalls and that we have to be very careful whenever we talk about it.

18:32.480 --> 18:38.880
And what we're going to do today is standard practice in physics. We're simply going to stipulate

18:39.760 --> 18:46.720
that of these components, A1 and A2, the separable components of Alice communicate

18:46.720 --> 18:51.040
classically. And so we're going to draw out like this. We're going to draw a classical channel

18:51.040 --> 18:57.760
between them. And that classical channel passes through Bob. It uses degrees of freedom of the

18:57.760 --> 19:04.800
ambient photon field or the ambient atmosphere or pieces of paper or email or something like that

19:05.360 --> 19:11.360
that's out there in the environment to exchange classical messages. And there are a couple of

19:11.360 --> 19:16.960
things to note here. I haven't even written down here. We're assuming that A1 and A2 share some

19:16.960 --> 19:21.840
language for this classical communication. That's a big assumption as we talked about last time.

19:23.840 --> 19:30.240
But I will note explicitly that classical communication takes time. That's what defines

19:30.240 --> 19:35.760
classicality here. It's causal. So it can't work faster than the speed of light.

19:37.040 --> 19:42.480
This is a topological theory. We don't have an embedding geometry. So we can't at this point

19:42.480 --> 19:48.640
talk about light, which is a relationship between space and time. Because we've got time,

19:48.640 --> 19:55.600
we've got clocks, but we don't have any space. But we can say that whatever passes through

19:55.600 --> 20:04.560
this classical channel requires at least one clock tick on Bob's side. So it's a process that

20:04.560 --> 20:14.160
Bob has to execute. And executing that process takes time. So getting the signal from me to you

20:14.160 --> 20:19.920
on the internet takes some time. So the environment's clock has to tick during that.

20:21.120 --> 20:28.320
And all of these assumptions bundled together turn out to be a fairly serious set of assumptions.

20:28.800 --> 20:34.800
And they involve assumptions about fine tuning, about the universe being just right.

20:36.400 --> 20:43.360
And they should make us nervous. And I just want to leave it at that. We always assume

20:43.360 --> 20:48.800
with complete aplomb that agents can communicate classically, but it's not a straightforward

20:48.800 --> 20:55.200
assumption. And it's worth any of you are looking at, for interesting research projects,

20:55.200 --> 21:00.640
can look into the nature of classical communication. It's full of hidden assumptions

21:00.640 --> 21:05.600
and surprises and things that aren't at all straightforward, even though they look like

21:05.600 --> 21:12.000
they ought to be. So there's a challenge. So why do we assume this? Why do we assume

21:12.000 --> 21:17.840
classical communication? We do it because we have to, if we're going to talk about detecting

21:17.840 --> 21:27.760
entanglement. And most of you probably know the history of the notion of entanglement.

21:27.760 --> 21:35.840
It was first noticed by Einstein, Podolski, and Rosen ever after called EPR in 1935.

21:36.640 --> 21:44.400
And they wrote a paper, which is infamous and called the EPR paper, in which they argued that

21:44.400 --> 21:48.960
the phenomenon of entanglement made no sense and couldn't possibly be physical.

21:50.080 --> 21:58.000
And since quantum theory included this notion of entanglement, it couldn't possibly be a complete

21:58.000 --> 22:05.520
theory of what's going on in the world. And Schrodinger replied the same year with a very

22:05.520 --> 22:11.200
detailed paper where he introduces among other things Schrodinger's cat as a paradox.

22:12.160 --> 22:17.920
And he explains very clearly what entanglement is and why entanglement follows from quantum theory.

22:18.720 --> 22:25.040
And he uses that discussion to argue that the classical notion of a physical state is not

22:25.040 --> 22:30.640
actually applicable to the world as it is. So he answers the EPR paper very directly.

22:31.120 --> 22:43.600
And this discussion is currently mostly known as the Bohr-Einstein debate because of course Bohr,

22:44.480 --> 22:51.680
already in 1928, has said in print that the classical notion of causality in space and time

22:51.680 --> 22:59.520
simply doesn't apply anymore. And Einstein objected to that vigorously. But that was 1935.

23:00.160 --> 23:05.360
And it was almost 50 years later that entanglement was first observed in the laboratory. Here,

23:05.360 --> 23:12.640
the 1982 picture is a picture of the interior of Alan Asbest laboratory when he performed

23:12.640 --> 23:17.600
the first entanglement experiment for which he finally won the Nobel Prize last year.

23:19.840 --> 23:27.360
And these days, this kind of experiment is done all over the world and is even done with

23:27.360 --> 23:37.840
satellite-borne sources. Potential resource is the key to quantum security, quantum

23:37.840 --> 23:44.400
security communication, as we'll discuss in quantum cryptography and quantum banking,

23:44.400 --> 23:47.920
the quantum internet, all this other stuff that you may have heard of.

23:48.320 --> 24:00.160
So before talking more about these experiments, I just want to provide a definition of entanglement.

24:02.320 --> 24:10.720
Entangled simply means not separable. That's the definition. So a state, a joint state,

24:10.720 --> 24:19.040
a b is entangled if and only if it does not factor into two separable states.

24:20.400 --> 24:29.280
And that's it. That's the definition. And the literature and especially the popular literature

24:29.280 --> 24:36.080
are, is absolutely rife with hype and various kinds of misjurification of entanglement. And

24:36.960 --> 24:44.080
authors trying to convince you that entanglement is this amazing kind of woo-woo thing.

24:45.280 --> 24:51.920
And whenever you run across that, go back to the definition. I mean, entanglement simply means

24:52.880 --> 25:00.240
this simple mathematical condition of not separability or a state that isn't factorizable.

25:01.200 --> 25:05.840
And that means that the state does not display classical conditional independence.

25:06.560 --> 25:11.440
So classically, that's the way to think about it. It's a failure of conditional independence.

25:12.240 --> 25:17.360
And it's ubiquitous in quantum theory, even though it wasn't actually hipster for almost

25:17.360 --> 25:24.640
50 years after it was predicted. So here's what all these experiments look like. They're called

25:24.640 --> 25:33.680
Bell EPR experiments after John Bell, who derived the statistical criterion for detecting entanglement.

25:34.480 --> 25:40.560
And EPR, Einstein, Podolski, and Rosen, who did this as a thought experiment and said,

25:40.560 --> 25:45.440
if this occurs in the theory, it can't possibly be real. And of course, it is real.

25:46.320 --> 25:51.680
It's now amply demonstrated by experimentation. Here's how they work. There's a source.

25:52.640 --> 26:01.600
The source produces a state that is entangled. And I've written the typical what's called a Bell state.

26:02.160 --> 26:07.280
It's up plus or minus down divided by the square root of 2, just to normalize it.

26:08.080 --> 26:15.200
But up plus or minus down is clearly not the same as up times down. So this is not a separable state.

26:15.520 --> 26:22.800
And this state propagates outward in space and time to two observers who have independent laboratories,

26:23.680 --> 26:28.960
for example, on different continents in that space-based experiment that I showed you the picture

26:28.960 --> 26:36.720
of from the cover of Science a few years ago, 2017, I think. The two observers have freedom

26:36.720 --> 26:43.360
to choose their own reference frame, their own z-axis for measuring spin. They do a spin measurement,

26:44.240 --> 26:50.640
and they do this over and over and over again. They accumulate statistics, and they exchange their

26:50.640 --> 26:57.680
results so that they can analyze the joint statistics of their experiment, and they check to see

26:57.680 --> 27:03.760
whether that joint statistics is consistent with classical probability theory. And if it isn't,

27:04.720 --> 27:13.680
to a statistically significant level, then they've been able to detect entanglement.

27:14.880 --> 27:22.160
Now, notice that this process requires classical communication. They have to make their independent

27:22.160 --> 27:27.360
measurements in their own laboratories, and then they have to exchange results.

27:27.360 --> 27:32.000
Or one of them has to send results to the other one, or they both have to send their results

27:32.000 --> 27:39.680
to some third party. But in all of these cases, they're exchanging some classical data, and so we

27:39.680 --> 27:45.920
have the assumption that whoever gets that classical data knows the language it was recorded in,

27:46.880 --> 27:53.120
and so can do a joint analysis. So I'll just show you another picture of this experiment

27:53.760 --> 27:59.360
that's in a standard space-time diagram. Here, time is vertical, space is horizontal.

28:02.000 --> 28:08.080
The two observers are labeled Alice and Bob. They share a quantum channel

28:08.640 --> 28:12.880
that goes from Alice to the source to Bob. That's the entangled state.

28:14.240 --> 28:21.280
They do some processing, and then one of them here, Bob, sends the results to Alice,

28:21.280 --> 28:27.280
and that's a classical communication. It takes time, and it traverses space.

28:27.600 --> 28:35.440
So this step is classical. So this is why we have to assume classical communication to talk about

28:36.000 --> 28:43.200
detecting or using entanglement. So now I want to represent this in a different way,

28:45.840 --> 28:51.040
using our little picture earlier. We're going to think of Alice again as two components,

28:51.040 --> 28:58.320
A1 and A2. They're separable, so they have to communicate classically. They have a classical

28:58.320 --> 29:04.640
channel that goes through Bob, and they also now share some quantum channel. They share an

29:04.640 --> 29:11.520
entangled state, and the entangled state, of course, is produced by Bob. The source is part of Bob,

29:12.480 --> 29:18.880
and their detectors, if you want to think about it that way, are located on this boundary B,

29:19.600 --> 29:22.560
or their interface with the source is on this boundary B,

29:23.840 --> 29:30.720
and each of them executes a process that accumulates data from the quantum channel

29:30.720 --> 29:34.480
and communicates it to the other observer via the classical channel.

29:36.000 --> 29:42.320
Now this picture illustrates what's called a LOC protocol. LOC means local operations

29:42.320 --> 29:49.840
in classical communication. So A1 and A2 are each operating locally on their boundary.

29:49.840 --> 29:56.560
They're making measurements locally on their boundary, and they're communicating via actions

29:56.560 --> 30:01.920
locally on their boundary and observations locally on their boundary. So for example,

30:03.520 --> 30:10.400
I'm communicating with my computer here, we can consider it my boundary, and stuff is happening

30:10.400 --> 30:16.960
in the environment that's implemented by the internet, and you're receiving those communications

30:17.680 --> 30:22.560
locally on your boundary, on your laptop, or whatever it is you're using.

30:23.360 --> 30:31.040
So that's what local operations means, and these protocols specifically involve classical

30:31.040 --> 30:37.040
communication, and so they're able to detect entanglement. And a Bell EPR experiment is just

30:37.040 --> 30:44.720
an example of a LOC protocol. The observers exchange information about how they're going

30:44.720 --> 30:49.680
to do their experiments, they're both going to measure the spin, they're going to use independently

30:49.680 --> 30:54.560
chosen reference frames, and they're going to look at the output from some agreed upon source.

30:56.000 --> 31:01.760
So that's all classically set up, then they actually make their observations, and then

31:01.760 --> 31:07.200
they classically communicate the results. So classical communication front and back.

31:08.960 --> 31:19.280
LOC protocols are not limited to this sort of Bell EPR sort of setting. We can also represent

31:19.280 --> 31:28.960
a scattering experiment as a LOC protocol. So here's a representation of scattering as a LOC

31:28.960 --> 31:38.720
protocol, and you can see all I've done is cut that previous boundary out the division between

31:38.720 --> 31:49.120
8.1 and 8.2, and I've then extended it in some external time, the time that is

31:49.520 --> 31:59.040
counted by Bob's clock, not by Alice's clock, that's what's meant by external, and I've relabeled

32:00.000 --> 32:07.840
Alice 2 as Alice 1 at a later time. So now what Alice is doing is communicating with her past self,

32:09.360 --> 32:15.920
or A1 is communicating with her future self, and they're each doing something different.

32:16.480 --> 32:24.160
A1 is executing a procedure that in the laboratory we call state preparation.

32:25.520 --> 32:32.160
She's preparing a state that we'll call N, which is just the initial state of some

32:32.160 --> 32:41.120
scattering experiment. So for example, at the LHC, N is some state of two protons that are

32:41.120 --> 32:50.320
quartering around the ring at the LHC at close to the speed of light, and Alice then later on

32:50.320 --> 32:58.000
at t plus delta t is doing a different kind of quantum process. She's analyzing the data

32:58.000 --> 33:05.440
coming out of something like the Atlas detector, which is a multi-particle counter that's located

33:05.440 --> 33:13.520
at the LHC. So they share a quantum channel, which is the scattering channel that takes the

33:13.520 --> 33:23.120
incoming state and produces the outgoing state, and I recall from the very first session, as Feynman

33:23.120 --> 33:30.880
told us, to understand this transition from N to out, we have to integrate over all possible paths

33:30.880 --> 33:39.440
that are consistent with conservation of spin-holicity, basically momentum plus spin.

33:42.080 --> 33:46.480
All the different spins that are relevant in a high-energy physics experiment,

33:46.480 --> 33:50.320
including things like lepton number, which is basically a spin.

33:52.560 --> 33:58.720
Now, how do we know? How do we know what we have to conserve? We know what we have to conserve

33:58.720 --> 34:06.160
because Alice is doing the experiment, has a classical memory that allows her to remember

34:06.880 --> 34:14.960
what she prepared. She can remember that what she did back in the past was set to protons

34:14.960 --> 34:21.280
counter-rotating in the LHC, and they had certain energies, and so they had certain momenta,

34:21.280 --> 34:27.600
and they were protons, so they had certain spin variables. All of that has to be remembered to

34:27.600 --> 34:37.760
make any sense of the output of the detectors, and so to actually come up with a measured state

34:37.760 --> 34:48.000
that makes sense. Very often, this memory channel is neglected by physicists, and I'm going to pause

34:48.000 --> 34:56.160
here and let Andrew ask a question. Thank you, Chris. Does this imply that every time you have a

34:56.160 --> 35:02.640
block channel, the quantum part is like a scattering picture, like a unitary evolution,

35:02.640 --> 35:08.640
even in the earlier EPR picture. Is that quantum channel portion always a unitary evolution

35:08.640 --> 35:22.560
scattering picture? Thank you. Yes, for essentially the reason that I'll define the classical

35:22.560 --> 35:25.680
channel, you're always assuming you have something that's protected from decoherence.

35:26.160 --> 35:35.280
By the environment. So, yeah, if you're doing an EPR experiment, you have to assume that you

35:35.280 --> 35:40.320
don't have any environmental decoherence between the source and the detectors,

35:41.600 --> 35:48.160
and similarly, when you're doing a scattering experiment, you have to make the assumption

35:48.160 --> 35:55.600
that the environment is not reaching in there and messing with the outgoing state that you're

35:55.600 --> 36:00.320
going to see or reaching in and messing with the incoming state and changing it in some way

36:00.880 --> 36:06.320
that re-prepares it in a way that you don't know, that you have no knowledge of.

36:07.280 --> 36:13.600
So, yes, you're making a fairly strong anti-decoherence assumption in any of these settings when you're

36:13.600 --> 36:21.840
talking about having a quantum channel. Does that answer the question? Yes, thank you.

36:21.840 --> 36:29.680
Okay, great. So, we can think of, we can think of LOC, we can think of scattering as LOC.

36:33.760 --> 36:41.520
And I just wanted to now emphasize that effectively what LOC is implementing is two

36:41.520 --> 36:48.240
parallel memories, a classical memory, which as we said in the case of scattering is memory for

36:48.240 --> 36:56.160
preparation. In the EPR case, it's memory for preparation for what the experimental setup is,

36:56.160 --> 37:04.240
for what the instructions for doing the experiment are. And we also have a quantum channel,

37:04.240 --> 37:10.000
which is effectively another memory. It's something that's extended through time,

37:11.040 --> 37:17.600
and again, it's implemented by the environment, implemented by Bob, and it involves Bob's clock

37:17.680 --> 37:27.680
ticking. So, whenever we have two memories in parallel, we can construct an error-correcting

37:27.680 --> 37:34.800
code. So, think of a simple classical error-correcting code, for example, the use of parity bits

37:36.160 --> 37:44.000
in exchanging digital data. So, if I send you a bit string, classically, and I send it to you

37:44.000 --> 37:51.760
two or three times, so there's some redundancy in my signal, and I send you a parity bit.

37:52.480 --> 37:58.720
I say, okay, add up your bit string, and the result should be one. It's one on my side.

37:59.840 --> 38:05.840
If you've added up and you get zero, there's an error someplace. You can use that parity bit to

38:05.840 --> 38:13.280
detect errors. So, you can throw out the bit strings that you receive that have parity as zero

38:14.000 --> 38:19.920
and say, oh, the environment interfered somehow with the signal, or some eavesdropper interfered

38:19.920 --> 38:23.920
with the signal and made a mistake, or something like that. So, this corresponds

38:25.920 --> 38:31.120
to environmental decoherence not being a good assumption, even though it's classical. Environmental

38:31.120 --> 38:37.920
interference is not a good assumption in this case. So, a quantum error-correcting code is

38:37.920 --> 38:46.160
basically the same idea. I use some feature of the fact that I have two different memories,

38:47.520 --> 38:57.600
and that I'm encoding something in time, I'm encoding multiple replicates of something in time,

38:57.840 --> 39:04.720
to provide a way of checking to make sure that I'm sending the correct message.

39:06.640 --> 39:14.240
So, I can, for example, consider the message to be my classical memory,

39:15.520 --> 39:23.520
and consider the quantum process as a process that tests that memory. So, I remember that I

39:23.520 --> 39:32.560
need to do experiment X, and I will get result Y. I actually do experiment X on this quantum channel

39:32.560 --> 39:41.280
and see if I get result Y. And if I don't get result Y, then something's wrong. Either I can't

39:41.280 --> 39:50.320
trust the quantum channel, or I've remembered my preparation conditions incorrectly. So, I'm

39:50.320 --> 39:56.560
using one memory to check the accuracy of the other. And this problem

39:58.960 --> 40:04.960
of using something about the environment, some channel in the environment, to check memory

40:05.920 --> 40:13.600
is absolutely ubiquitous, and we use it all the time. So, for example, look around your room,

40:13.840 --> 40:21.440
and your room hopefully looks more or less the same now that it did at the start of this session.

40:23.120 --> 40:30.720
And that's very reassuring. It reassures you that something's not happening in the environment

40:30.720 --> 40:41.120
that's dangerous and disturbing. And if you couldn't do that, if your environment was constantly

40:41.120 --> 40:47.120
changing, and there was no familiarity about the environment, you wouldn't be able to check your

40:47.120 --> 40:53.680
memory. You wouldn't be able to check your sanity. So, even though we don't think about

40:54.880 --> 41:00.480
our local environments as effectively an error correcting code, that's exactly how we use it.

41:00.480 --> 41:06.560
We use the emerging memory or memory out there in the environment as a way of checking our own

41:06.560 --> 41:16.560
memories and assuring that our memory is okay. So, I talked a little bit about quantum security.

41:17.440 --> 41:25.280
Here's how quantum security system works. Again, it's a lock protocol. We have some classical

41:25.360 --> 41:34.560
signal that can be thought of as a code or a key or a one-time pad, for example,

41:35.280 --> 41:42.720
that encodes a way of doing experiments. And once that's been exchanged, assuming it's secure,

41:43.440 --> 41:50.720
then we can use the quantum channel to communicate information. And the classical channel has told

41:50.720 --> 41:56.320
us what we have to do with that quantum channel. We have to make certain kinds of measurements

41:57.040 --> 42:06.160
at, say, particular clock times as measured, and we'll get information sent from the past,

42:07.600 --> 42:17.280
from the sender. And the classical channel protects the quantum channel from adversarial agents,

42:17.280 --> 42:24.400
because anything that an adversarial agent does to the quantum channel, if some agent

42:24.400 --> 42:29.760
tries to eavesdrop, for example, on the quantum channel, they'll disrupt the quantum channel,

42:30.640 --> 42:37.920
and the results of our measurement will not be what's expected given the protocol that we run,

42:38.480 --> 42:47.200
that we have run. So quantum communication is secured by the fact that interfering with some

42:47.200 --> 42:54.480
entangled state actually destroys the state, so it's detectable. We can always know if someone is

42:54.480 --> 42:59.840
trying to disrupt our communications, which isn't true if we just have two classical channels.

43:01.040 --> 43:05.760
Charlie can always intercept a message and then recreate it, and that's not possible

43:06.560 --> 43:17.760
with a quantum channel. So let's refold this diagram so that we've taken the external time

43:18.480 --> 43:26.960
back out of it. And we have this picture where the two components of Alice are just interacting

43:26.960 --> 43:33.600
via their shared boundary with their environment, Bob. And now we can see that the source of

43:33.600 --> 43:42.720
redundancy is not time, it's the boundary itself. Just sharing the boundary allows

43:44.000 --> 43:53.520
Alice's components, A1 and A2, to put copies of the same information on different places

43:53.520 --> 44:00.400
on the boundary. So the boundary now becomes a resource for redundant storage of information.

44:01.360 --> 44:06.640
So Alice 1 and Alice 2 can use different parts of the boundary

44:09.760 --> 44:16.560
to check what other parts of the boundary say, to check the information that's encoded on other

44:16.560 --> 44:23.680
parts of the boundary. So they can define an error correcting code on the boundary itself

44:24.400 --> 44:39.600
using this lock protocol. So I just want to leave you with this idea that using classical and quantum

44:40.480 --> 44:49.680
channels together allows us to define error correcting codes on boundaries that we share

44:50.000 --> 45:03.280
as separate agents. And leave you to think about what shared measurements, what shared

45:03.280 --> 45:15.200
quantum reference frames, let us as agents see the same things. And this is what we'll talk about

45:16.000 --> 45:26.000
next time in September. We'll talk specifically about how space provides us with an error correcting

45:26.000 --> 45:37.280
code and try to understand why space is treated as emergent from something else, basically,

45:37.360 --> 45:46.000
from communication in most of quantum gravity. So thank you very much. I encourage you to use

45:46.000 --> 45:53.360
the interactive QA and to attend the discussion sessions and we'll see you in September. Thank you.

45:54.320 --> 46:08.720
Awesome. Chris, thank you for the lecture. Andrew, do you have any remarks or questions?

46:09.920 --> 46:16.880
Not right now. Thank you. I'll just ask a few quick questions and if anyone has one quickly

46:16.880 --> 46:24.400
in the live chat. So you mentioned the tick of the clock and in active inference, we often hold

46:24.400 --> 46:31.040
up side by side both the discrete time models and the continuous time models. So do clocks have to

46:31.040 --> 46:40.880
tick discreetly or how do we think about continuous time modeling? In this in this quantum setting,

46:40.960 --> 46:46.240
they do have to tick discreetly because one has to be able to distinguish

46:48.000 --> 46:53.600
Alice's preparation of the qubits on her boundary from Bob's measurements of the

46:54.480 --> 47:05.440
qubits on the boundary. And this process can be extremely fast with respect to any kind of sense

47:05.440 --> 47:14.560
of macroscopic time. You know, your eyes are responding to photons in I think it's hundreds

47:14.560 --> 47:25.440
of femtoseconds. So the discrete transitions that are effectively time measurements for you

47:26.560 --> 47:33.280
are at that very fast molecular time scale, much, much faster than our typical clocks.

47:36.400 --> 47:41.440
When we try to do very fast timing, we're constructing a faster clock than that,

47:42.080 --> 47:45.440
but it's a clock that we can only observe indirectly.

47:50.720 --> 47:57.680
Awesome. Okay. Now this one maybe connects a little bit to application, but with all the

47:57.680 --> 48:04.320
developments happening in theory, some of which you're reviewing here, and also in practice with

48:04.320 --> 48:11.920
quantum computation, and then keeping in mind this distinction. Sorry, I've lost you. Back.

48:17.360 --> 48:24.160
I've lost you, Daniel. Okay, we'll wait till you're back. I can see you. No. Okay. Yeah,

48:24.160 --> 48:31.280
just repeat your question, please. Yeah, so given these rapid and ongoing developments in

48:31.280 --> 48:36.480
theory and practice related to quantum information science and quantum information security,

48:37.440 --> 48:45.120
how are people using this distinction of the classical Stigmergic memory and then the

48:45.120 --> 48:49.040
quantum cognitive process to anticipate

48:51.600 --> 48:56.960
how to develop information systems that are reliable going forward?

48:57.520 --> 49:10.880
I don't know of any instances in which thinking about quantum cognition has entered directly into

49:10.880 --> 49:20.240
any design of communication systems. The ability of humans to interact with these systems is just

49:20.240 --> 49:29.120
assumed. So it's just assumed that the user can interact with, say, a computer interface,

49:30.720 --> 49:36.640
which is the sort of interface that will be provided or is provided to any quantum computer.

49:37.200 --> 49:43.920
So if you think about a quantum computer, a practical quantum computer, it has classical

49:43.920 --> 49:53.440
interfaces front and back. So in thinking about interacting with the computer, I'm giving it some

49:53.440 --> 49:59.760
classical problem statement, for example, and asking for some classical answer. And what it's

49:59.760 --> 50:06.880
going to give me is a probability distribution of classical answers. But I can, by running the

50:06.880 --> 50:11.040
calculation many times, make that probability distribution fairly tight.

50:15.600 --> 50:22.160
So yeah, I don't know of anyone talking about quantum BCIs at this point. It'd be an interesting

50:22.160 --> 50:34.640
question. Was it always understood these sorts of blind spots and axioms associated with classical

50:35.280 --> 50:45.680
communication? Was it developed as kind of like a proposal or like a special case? And more unpacking

50:45.680 --> 50:50.640
was left for later? Or are these blind spots things that we're now coming into awareness of,

50:50.640 --> 50:53.760
given what we're learning in the quantum information sciences?

50:55.920 --> 51:02.560
I think we're learning how serious they are. But they were certainly recognized even by Bohr

51:02.560 --> 51:12.880
in his 1928 paper. And that's a very good paper, too. It's called the present state of quantum

51:12.880 --> 51:18.960
theory or something like that, and it's in nature. And it's available on the web somewhere.

51:20.720 --> 51:29.280
I have a copy of it. But it was written, in a sense, as Bohr's summary of the 1927 Solvay

51:29.280 --> 51:34.480
conference, which was the conference at which everyone doing quantum theory at that time

51:35.200 --> 51:45.040
got together to talk about their results. And in it, Bohr essentially presents what came to be

51:45.040 --> 51:56.400
the Copenhagen interpretation, which I think is probably unfairly called an interpretation.

51:56.400 --> 52:06.640
And it's sort of the Copenhagen pragmatic stance toward quantum theory. And essentially what Bohr

52:06.640 --> 52:16.880
says is that if we're going to do science, we have to assume that people can talk to each other.

52:18.640 --> 52:24.960
And if we're going to do science, we have to assume that there are instruments that we can

52:24.960 --> 52:33.120
manipulate and have reasonable confidence that we know what manipulation we've done. So if I turn

52:33.120 --> 52:39.920
a knob from one to two, I have to be reasonably confident that I'm making a particular change

52:39.920 --> 52:49.280
that I can understand. And we have to have reasonable confidence that different laboratories can

52:49.280 --> 52:55.920
replicate the same experiment. And if we think about any of those assumptions in purely quantum

52:55.920 --> 53:03.680
theoretic terms, then all sorts of questions are raised, right? Every quantum system is unique.

53:04.400 --> 53:11.600
We have the no cloning theorem. So every scientific instrument is unique. So there's no such thing as

53:12.560 --> 53:19.680
exactly replicating an experiment, right? That's a coarse-grained description of what I've done

53:19.680 --> 53:27.520
with a completely unique quantum system. And my brain, of course, is unique. And yours is too,

53:27.520 --> 53:36.480
and everyone else's is. So talking about a sharing a language is essentially a coarse-grained assumption.

53:36.800 --> 53:44.800
And what the Copenhagen stance is all about is coarse-graining, yielding, effective classicality.

53:44.800 --> 53:52.160
Or what that really means is coarse-graining, yielding, a description that we can use in

53:52.160 --> 54:00.800
the language that we understand. So these are very, very old issues that have been recognized for a

54:01.440 --> 54:07.760
long time. But I think, in part, because of the disaster of shut up and calculate,

54:09.600 --> 54:11.840
they haven't really been talked about in the classroom.

54:15.040 --> 54:20.400
Awesome. I'll just read short questions from the chat. We can just, we can pass them to the

54:20.400 --> 54:25.440
discussion section, but there's a lot of great diverse questions. So Alexi wrote.

54:26.000 --> 54:29.680
I think I've lost you again. The Revenge of Zoom.

54:30.400 --> 54:35.040
Well, we looked at the chart earlier where like Bob was talking to Alice,

54:36.160 --> 54:38.400
the unidirectional communication. Okay, good.

54:40.080 --> 54:45.120
Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. The unidirectional. The third party is recording it, I'm sure.

54:46.400 --> 54:53.840
Alexi wrote regarding the environment for being used for error correction. A symptom of

54:53.840 --> 55:00.720
derealization in psychological trauma breakdown. We don't recognize the environment around us and

55:00.720 --> 55:10.720
it's scary. Makes sense. Makes sense. All right. From Bala. Nice presentation. I heard Chris say,

55:11.360 --> 55:17.920
entangled states are LOCC for a specific reference frame. Is this entanglement unitary or

55:18.640 --> 55:21.200
is it related to the numbers of degrees of freedom?

55:24.720 --> 55:35.440
I think the quick answer would be both. If you have a complex system with many

55:35.440 --> 55:43.920
degrees of freedom, some can be entangled while others aren't. It depends on what parts of the

55:43.920 --> 55:49.920
state are separable. So again, entanglement is just a statement about

55:50.880 --> 55:57.040
components of a joint state that factor or don't.

55:59.760 --> 56:04.240
So you can have a joint state that looks separable along some dimensions, but

56:06.800 --> 56:10.320
other dimensions. The other big complication here is that

56:11.040 --> 56:16.640
whether a state looks entangled depends on the reference frames that you use to measure it with.

56:16.640 --> 56:26.400
And if you pick entangled reference frames, then what we ordinarily think of as separable

56:26.400 --> 56:30.880
does entangled states become separable. So you can move entanglement around.

56:33.840 --> 56:40.560
Awesome. Okay. From Roland Rodriguez. Is the discrete temporality only within the context

56:40.560 --> 56:46.000
of a given holographic screen interface? With time being bracketed otherwise,

56:46.000 --> 56:50.880
beyond interface systems is continuity or discretion kept agnostic?

56:54.880 --> 57:03.040
I think if I understand the question correctly, it's yes. If I don't draw any boundaries,

57:03.760 --> 57:13.760
I just have the joint state, then the evolution is unitary. And in a sense, time plays no role.

57:15.040 --> 57:23.520
And if unitary evolution is perfectly time symmetric, so time actually drops out altogether.

57:26.000 --> 57:28.320
Awesome. So to talk about time, we have to draw boundaries.

57:29.280 --> 57:37.440
Awesome. Time must have a stop. And I'll ask one last question from the appropriately

57:37.440 --> 57:44.880
monocled question quanderer. All communication is abductive. Is a sentiment that I've been

57:44.880 --> 57:51.280
using to develop some arguments? Does that scan for you? How do we connect what we're discussing

57:51.280 --> 58:04.000
here with quantum to abductive logic? Yeah. I could go along with that. I want a lot more detail.

58:06.800 --> 58:11.920
All communication is essentially analogical. I would agree with that. Yes.

58:11.920 --> 58:22.960
Andrew? Yes, thank you. So going back to the picture where the scattering picture,

58:24.400 --> 58:31.920
so we have so far everything is topological and certainly induces breaking the boundary

58:31.920 --> 58:37.920
in different sectors. I suppose it induces a topology on the boundary. Now, I have a couple

58:37.920 --> 58:46.000
questions asked for the geometry, and this might be getting ahead. Is it an emerging property of

58:46.000 --> 58:51.840
those channels between different boundary sectors? And if that's the case, then what does it mean to

58:51.840 --> 59:06.160
have a QRF for space? Yeah, this is really the topic for September. But you do point out the

59:06.160 --> 59:14.560
fact that it's something of a chicken and egg situation. The way I think of it is I suppose

59:14.560 --> 59:24.720
to choose the chicken side and think about what kind of reference frame does the agent have to

59:24.720 --> 59:35.600
implement to see space on their boundary? And the reason I think about it that way is

59:35.600 --> 59:41.280
that's a question I want to be able to ask about biological systems. And this actually gets into

59:42.160 --> 59:49.520
probably what won't be talked about until October. But I want to be able to ask

59:52.320 --> 59:59.600
essentially a phylogenetic question of what sorts of organisms, where in the lineage from Luca,

59:59.600 --> 01:00:08.560
do we find systems that are able to assign spatial coordinates to their boundaries?

01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:20.080
And what coordinates come first? And I suspect that sort of discrete location names with no metric

01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:28.160
come first. That a system can talk about, for example, this part of their membrane versus

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:33.600
that part of their membrane without even having any ability to say how far apart they are.

01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:40.320
That some sort of metric representation of this angular space comes later.

01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:50.240
And that a radial space comes even later than that. That's at this point speculation. But I

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:55.920
think these are questions that we can end up asking given the right kind of formalism

01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:01.920
and the right understanding of what it means to be able to make a spatial measurement.

01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:09.680
So the conjecture is that the metric would emerge from a discrete network metric of counting ticks

01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:18.480
sort of thing? Yeah, I think that's correct. And the sort of cemeteries of space that we see

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:27.760
are very much tied up with object identity. So if we think about something like rotational symmetry,

01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:35.680
let's see. I should stop screen sharing.

01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:46.320
So I've got this object, right? And I can do this and I say, oh, the space has this rotational

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:52.480
symmetry. But for me to say that, I have to recognize that this is the same object, right?

01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:59.200
I have to implement object persistence, which we all learn to do when we're nine months old or

01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:09.520
something. But we tend to regard those as separate things as, you know, we learn object persistence

01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:15.280
because space is rotationally symmetric. But we can view it the other way around that space is

01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:22.000
rotationally symmetric for me, because I implement these constraints that are called object persistence.

01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:32.000
Do you think we can understand phylogenetics as a whole, as a kind of scattering experiment,

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:40.720
like the high energy Luca event, and then dissipating and propagating in a very tangled bank?

01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:49.440
Well, I do want to be able to understand phylogeny in exactly the same terms as embryology.

01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:54.400
And Mike Levin and I have published papers about that. We should be able to view the

01:02:54.400 --> 01:03:01.520
lineage of Luca in exactly the same way that, you know, we view the lineage of the zygote that produced us.

01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:10.960
So that's why it's no coincidence that during pregnancy, the development of the embryo

01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:14.880
mirrors evolution in terms of the parts that are developed first?

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:23.360
Yeah, this is the old idea that phylogenia and ontogenia are related in some way,

01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:30.320
which from an embryonic development point of view, they're certainly analogous in ways.

01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:36.480
And sorry, if I may ask one last question, I think it should be very quick.

01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:42.480
Regarding the weak rotation, I'm still a bit unsure of how it ties to this

01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:48.080
diagrammatic notation that we had with quantum channels and so on.

01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:55.200
And there was a note in the second session, we briefly talked about the weak rotation,

01:03:56.160 --> 01:04:02.480
you know, being a reversal in the direction of time. Is there any relation to today's session?

01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:18.480
Yeah, whenever we think about the flow of time as driven by the input output cycle,

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:28.400
the input output cycle for agents separated by a boundary is always, there's always a sign

01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:37.120
change, right? My input is your output and vice versa. So when we think about the

01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:50.480
Bob's clock ticking when Alice does something, his direction of time, in a sense,

01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:54.240
points with respect to the boundary opposite to hers.

01:04:56.880 --> 01:05:03.520
But that's only with respect to the boundary. He sees information flowing in and she sees

01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:12.080
information flowing in. That's the only point being made here about the weak rotation as an

01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:24.080
operation. Thank you, Chris. Very well appreciated by the viewers and by us. So we'll certainly

01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:31.680
look forward to reviewing the Q&A and everybody is welcome and encouraged to join for the

01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:37.840
participatory discussion in about two weeks on Saturday. So till next time.

01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:41.680
All right. Thank you. Cheers.

01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:03.060
you
