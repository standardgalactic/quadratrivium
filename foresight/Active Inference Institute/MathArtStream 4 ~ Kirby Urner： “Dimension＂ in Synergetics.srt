00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Hello and welcome. It is July 12, 2024. We are in Actinth MathArtStream number four today joined by Kirby Erner. Kirby, please begin.

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Okay. Thank you for having me, everyone. There's been a little bit of email traffic leading up to this and I've been attending to this channel and I wanted to just point viewers who see this later too that this is episode four and they're already on a journey and it has to do with visualizing the fourth dimension and applying art towards this challenge.

3
00:00:49,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And it's kind of a puzzle piece that Daniel knows that I know for sure. I don't know if everyone knows but there is kind of, I feel in the hiker metaphor that you've climbed pretty high now and here's an overview of view of like a neighboring or adjacent space where 40 is also important fourth dimension, etc.

4
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Now, I know there's some Wittgenstein knowledge around here so Operation Duck Rabbit is an allusion to the kind of Gestalt Shift you need and I just drew this. It's very poorly drawn. I have a doofy style of drawing. I'm influenced by Mad Magazine, I think.

5
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And the rabbit looks kind of sad. You can see his kind of wiggly mouth. That's just trying to do feathers on the back of the duck's head. I was trying to like compromise there. So it's both a duck and a rabbit and this is one of the easy ones, right? There's a lot of these that flip at you.

6
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Like this one, it's easy to go back and forth between the duck and the rabbit but some of them, you just can't do it. People try to help you. They coach you. Well, look at it like this and it doesn't help, right? You can't see the old lady or whatever they're trying to.

7
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So that is a challenge and it's part of what it means to kind of ease into some new field. You have to develop the Gestalt's associated therewith.

8
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So the outline of what I plan to do real quick, duck rabbit, kind of drawing from my Wittgenstein background. I had Rory who's into pragmatism as one of my thesis advisors. I did have to write a thesis even though I was just an undergrad at the time and defend it and blah, blah.

9
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:40,000
But I wrote on the later Wittgenstein, right? There's two Wittgenstines for those who aren't familiar. He's got sort of an early philosophy and a later philosophy.

10
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So on that note of how things evolve, how we don't end up where we start necessarily, this picture shows what I'd call Euclidean geometry going forward in time.

11
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And it kind of forks when they realize, oh, the fifth postulate, we could mess with that so we can have non-Euclidean geometry in that sense.

12
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And relativity kind of comes in around there. I'm talking about Einstein. Euclidean continues.

13
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And I'm forking off another namespace as I call it. Cinergeti is kind of more off of Einstein stuff than off what I call extended Euclideanism, which is ND Hilbert space fourth dimension as another spatial dimension, not time.

14
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
There's a difference. So there's three namespaces here. I'm drawing a triangle. I'm saying these exist and come and go.

15
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So namespaces is like a shop talk, a context, or as Wittgenstein would say, a form of life, a grammar, like chess versus checkers.

16
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:48,000
They come with a whole different world, not just the games, but the tournaments, how it is, and then look more at some of the Bucky stuff.

17
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:56,000
What is it? Now let's start with the language game, since y'all are math fluent, don't feel bad about just starting with some notation.

18
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:05,000
In this culture, let's say these are like Mongols and Amalayas or something. Let's say we unearthed this archaeology. This existed at one point.

19
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And instead of negative numbers and positive numbers, they decided to add another tuple. So the negatives, they've got a one to the right.

20
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Now this may look bad. It's like, well, no, if it's on the right, then the tuple should be the rightmost tuple and blah, blah.

21
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So you could flip it, whatever. Don't overthink it.

22
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And then the same culture, when they want to get to a plane or a flat space, they do it like this with three fences.

23
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You could call them reference lines, what we call vectors or rays or whatever.

24
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And you can see how if you have a dot in this part of it between A and B, just using vector addition, right?

25
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You only need so much A and so much B to get there.

26
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:58,000
So a combination, a linear combination of A and B basis vectors is sufficient to get any point in this part of the y.

27
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
This is just a flat y. There's no perspective implied here. There's no 90 degree angles. It's just a y flat on the plane.

28
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:20,000
But I'm showing how you have kind of a zero for everybody here in the third place because there is no C component of resonance of this triangle region.

29
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Then we go to the quad version of it where we divide space into four quadrants.

30
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Again, we add another coordinate for the new vector.

31
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And by the way, there is a good example of using a y on a surface.

32
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And that's the Jodie Foster, very large array.

33
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I say Jodie Foster because she's in a movie where she talks to aliens through this or something like that.

34
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
But there's a y. So there's a way of thinking about the...

35
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So there's a culture that does this and at what you would call or we would call the third dimension, we're already looking like this now.

36
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,000
We're going to address all the points in... I'd call it Euclidean space. It's the same space XYZ is about.

37
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
But we're using tuples. We're using four tuples instead of three tuples.

38
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And we don't need negative numbers here because we've dealt with that issue in a different way.

39
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's still got all the same properties, however, of vector addition, linear combination.

40
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,000
This spans XYZ space. You could say everybody gets a four number address unique.

41
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
And so this is my cue when I get to the books is to jump to a slightly different track.

42
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So fuller synergetics.

43
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
What I just showed you, the quadrate coordinates have all come out since synergetics.

44
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
They're not in this book synergetics.

45
00:06:50,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And in fact, people felt maybe it's a weakness of Fuller's critique of XYZ and cubic orthodoxy that he didn't have an alternative really to propose.

46
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And quadrates I think he would have been excited about, but he didn't live to see them.

47
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
So I just wanted to say that.

48
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Now, where should we put Fuller historically?

49
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Historically, like going back recently, he noticed I'm segueing on the books.

50
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
We got the postage stamp.

51
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
He's kind of in a way he's an academic, but he's also very much a cold warrior.

52
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I think we can paint him that way.

53
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Without much apology, he was military industrial complex in a way.

54
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
He worked with the military on shelter stuff.

55
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And here I've found something buried in the archives where he's recommending someone to be in contact with Ho Chi Minh.

56
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Somebody, some journalist, some British journalist, but he's saying, oh, you should send him to Vietnam, whatever.

57
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
So I don't know, you know, I'm not the super expert on this, but I do know that he worked very closely.

58
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Pretty much his whole life with this gentleman, Abel White, who I talked about.

59
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
And Abel White knew this guy who's one of the CIA guys.

60
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
And there's Ezra Pound.

61
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And these two corresponded a lot because back at Yale, when this guy ran a literary magazine called Orlando, he was always being in touch with Ezra Pound, going over Italy, met him and stuff.

62
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
So there's starting to be a literary flavor to what I'm talking about.

63
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And also, why was Bucky a darling of the Pentagon?

64
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Well, because of this is a modern version of what they got into the due line, the early, the early warning system about, you know, monitoring way up north around the Arctic circles to sense what kind of activities might be coming over the horizon from the other side of the Earth.

65
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Meaning missiles, jets, who knows, right?

66
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
So, or what these are called weather stations as well, because they're useful for civilian purposes.

67
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
So you can say Fuller had this.

68
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:18,000
In fact, here's I have from from the trend tab lists, a recent posting I gave where I found an actual photograph of when one of his domes was in the garden of the Pentagon.

69
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Like if the center surrounded by the five wings or whatever you call them in that garden, they did even put this dome there at some point.

70
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Now, probably why I bring that up is because when I get to Coxeter and University of Toronto, I want to talk about our relationship between Coxeter and Fuller.

71
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And I want to mention the Pentagon's support of the Bucky patent on the dome and how this led to some consternation and conflicts in a way.

72
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm not going to spend a lot of time on that, but so here we are back in 1928 and Fuller's got this four D symbol kind of weird look in the teardrop shape.

73
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Daniel's seen other versions or colored versions recently in the archives.

74
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
And this is way back from 28.

75
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And he's throwing his hat in the ring, basically, as another one who's into this four D as a meme.

76
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And four D, there's a lot of ferment at the early 1900s.

77
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Now here we're talking 28, so we're quarter into quarter into it, but there's still a lot of thought and talk about what the fourth dimension means.

78
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
What it's about.

79
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Where is it going with, you know, it's not that kind of drive.

80
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Let's put it that way.

81
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:48,000
And a good way to pick up that story is to go back and read this book, The Fourth Dimension Non Euclidean Geometry and Modern Art by Linda Del Rimpel Henderson.

82
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
She does a really good job of tracing the multiple strands, the multiple schools of thought.

83
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Now, I'd say there was kind of a shakeout over the course of the 1900s.

84
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
And they didn't all survive, let's say, but Fuller had a strong sense of branding.

85
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
He was into self promotion.

86
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
He didn't want to delegate how to advertise himself.

87
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
He thought that was the most important thing.

88
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
So he kept tight control over his own publicity.

89
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Escher is going to come into the story, but this is the space Fuller was most interested in.

90
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:37,000
In terms of spear packing, what we call this CCP or FCC, or what he called IVM, isotropic vector matrix, which sounds kind of pretentious and long.

91
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,000
And so that's why people have a problem with Fuller is because he wrote everything almost, it's all in prose.

92
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It's not looking, it doesn't look tightly mathematical.

93
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It looks like somebody writing a lot of loquacious verbiage that's maybe not very high quality.

94
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
That's kind of what a lot of people's impression is.

95
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
But I decided now, let's really see what's here.

96
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
But you can see he's uncomfortable.

97
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:12,000
He's like that whiny kid or that rebellious kid in early elementary school when the teacher draws a dot on the chalkboard and says,

98
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
this is a point, but that's not really a point because point has no dimension.

99
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
And you can see this is really a pile of chalk.

100
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
So there's really the point you can't really see it.

101
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:33,000
And, you know, the kid raises their hand and it's like, so if I can't really see it, how do I know it's there or whatever they get into some stupid argument with the teacher, right?

102
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,000
And Fuller is like the guy who continues that argument, even into his 70s and 80s.

103
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
And he doesn't publish synergics until like 75 with the help of that Applewhite.

104
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
But he's like, he doesn't like this infinitely in planes, right?

105
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,000
And there's this guy, Carl Manger, I found the logical, not a logical positive, Vienna circle guy.

106
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
And he wrote this essay back when Einstein was treated more like a philosopher.

107
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
In those days, Einstein was looked up to and it's like, this is going to be a philosopher.

108
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
We're going to study Einstein and philosophy departments.

109
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And that never really happened.

110
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
He's kind of in the physics department.

111
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Philosophy took a different tack.

112
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
So you see in the title here, it's Albert Einstein, philosopher, scientist.

113
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
That's kind of like calling the Dalai Lama a scientist, which some people do, but it sounds weird, right?

114
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:38,000
So Geometry of Lumps, Carl Manger in this essay is saying Euclid's assumptions about points, lines and planes has this twofold idealization.

115
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
First, we don't talk about the extension of the dots or the thickness of the boards.

116
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
And also they all have to be infinite, or at least if they start to be long, I have to, you know what I mean, right?

117
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
So he's into infinity, which is fine.

118
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
And he's into infinity of smallness.

119
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It's like with the infinite plane comes infinitely thin.

120
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It's like one over infinity.

121
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
They're both there.

122
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
If you don't want that, what if you want a geometry of lumps?

123
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:13,000
And also here's pushback from Darcy Thompson writing in 1918 to Whitehead.

124
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
And he's having trouble with three dimensional.

125
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
And why are we saying three dimensional again for space?

126
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Who came up with that?

127
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
And he has an alternative.

128
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I would think it might be four dimensional coordinates.

129
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
We'll see about that.

130
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:39,000
And so Geometry of Lumps in Fuller, this is quoting from Synergetics, is very much lumpy.

131
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
He's like size is always special case.

132
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
But if you're talking about the eternal thing, it's metaphysical, whatever it's not special case.

133
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It's timeless.

134
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It's sub frequency means it only had shape.

135
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You had frequency, you get size, you get energy involvement.

136
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
But if you're just talking about the shape of a thing, it's all about its angles.

137
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
And a tetrahedron is really simpler than a cube.

138
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
And it's been too overlooked.

139
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:13,000
He's kind of coming to Western civilization and saying, I see you went with the cube as your most important shape.

140
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
You got these platonics here on the table.

141
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I like the cube.

142
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
But what about the tetrahedron here?

143
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
It's simpler.

144
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
It's got fewer vertices, all these things.

145
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Why didn't you go with the tetrahedron?

146
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
What's your reason?

147
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
And, you know, that starts a discussion, I think that Fuller is triggering.

148
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:39,000
And so if I were to teach this for in high school to jump to the beginning of this show, I won't go through the whole thing.

149
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I'm not going to plot through any of my shows from start to end.

150
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Here, I would usually give some autobiography as well as biography about Fuller.

151
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
And then I would jump to the books and that's my cue.

152
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Let's go to some other place.

153
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Let's just talk a little bit of history.

154
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
How would I introduce Fuller today as an historical figure?

155
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
How would I do that?

156
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I've shown you sort of connections to Abelwhite and Ezra Pound as kind of tenuous.

157
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
The Ezra Pound is a clue.

158
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
It's kind of a poet.

159
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Fuller wanted to be seen as a poet.

160
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
You can find where he says that.

161
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Then he plays a little language game, but you're not allowed to call yourself a poet.

162
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Only other people can call you a poet.

163
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
So he's like, he cites e-comings and all this.

164
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
It's like, please, please, I'm a poet.

165
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
But, you know, it was kind of his revenge because he got expelled from Harvard a couple of times.

166
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,000
But by the end of his life, he delivered the Charles Eliot Norton lecture.

167
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
And that's kind of a poetic position at Harvard.

168
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Anyway, anyway.

169
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
So when I tell the story here on the lower left, that's Margaret Fuller.

170
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
And that's his great aunt.

171
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
And she's a contemporary of Ada Byron.

172
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
And I like to link the two, not that they ever met or anything,

173
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
but they were rethinking women who are a totally scholar.

174
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I feel bad for Ada sometimes, but her dad was Lord Byron.

175
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
And they didn't want her to know until she was like 21.

176
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
And they take her into this room and they pull back this curtain.

177
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
And there's a portrait, and this is your father.

178
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
And she's like, whatever, teenager.

179
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
It makes a good movie.

180
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Anyway, continue it.

181
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
There's Margaret Fuller.

182
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
See, she was an American Transcendentalist.

183
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
So you've got Emerson here.

184
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
This is a time when Harvard is turning from Unitarian to Transcendentalist.

185
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
You could put it that way.

186
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
With influence from Kant through Coleridge and people like that.

187
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:03,000
So it's a drift in American philosophy to become what we call Transcendentalist.

188
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Nietzsche really admired Emerson.

189
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Nietzsche lives later in time.

190
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
He's looking back.

191
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
And okay, so here's me.

192
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I've thrown myself in on much older than that now.

193
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
That's my high school yearbook picture.

194
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
And this gentleman is Sam Lanahan.

195
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
And he turns out to be the grandson of Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald.

196
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
But he was really into tensegrity and stuff.

197
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
The buck he was into and actually went as a personal escort or sort of gopher,

198
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
chaperone, somebody to hang with when they went to the Philippines that time

199
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
as a guest of the Marcos family to Manila.

200
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Fuller is flying around the world a lot by the time he's this age in this picture.

201
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
And the coincidence there, an interesting coincidence,

202
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,000
is I would have been a high school student in Manila right about that same time.

203
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
But I wasn't really tracking bucky then.

204
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I hadn't gone to Princeton yet and therefore I hadn't read my Wittgenstein yet

205
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
and I didn't really get into the bucky stuff until after that anyway.

206
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
But I just wanted to give a little bit of my history and then comes that same slide

207
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
of Apooyte again.

208
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
And here we've got bucky with Ezra Pound towards the end of his life.

209
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
And if you know about Ezra Pound and his story,

210
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
he really felt he'd taken a wrong turn a few times because he ended up in prison, right?

211
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,000
He was put in a mental hospital for 11 years for the stuff he was saying on Italian radio

212
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
during World War II.

213
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
And he's like, well, if I'd been America, you would let me say it because I would have been protected.

214
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
But because I'm in Italy, a lot of people wanted him shot, right?

215
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
It was a very controversial time.

216
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
So I'm just taking you back to an older time that probably you don't know about,

217
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
forgotten about, whatever.

218
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
But Ezra Pound was very supportive of James Joyce,

219
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
this guy in the middle, Hugh Canary, he's a James Joyce scholar,

220
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
and kind of Fuller's crowd in a way.

221
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Hugh kind of wrote a biography of Fuller.

222
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:11,000
So I'm trying to put Fuller in a literary circle instead of a science physics circle,

223
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
even though he totally admired Einstein, really looked up to Einstein,

224
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
want to get to that relationship in a minute.

225
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
And here we have Applewhite and Fuller in a famous picture on the right,

226
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
the Swab, Applewhite, and that's Donald Coxer in the middle.

227
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I don't have his picture labeled or anything.

228
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
And this is Jeffrey Hinton on the left,

229
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
considered the father of machine learning by some,

230
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
the guy who quit Google not so long ago to warn us of the dangers of AI.

231
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Both of these guys are from the University of Toronto in Canada.

232
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Canada plays a really strong role in development of machine learning,

233
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
et cetera, artificial intelligence.

234
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Sometimes I play up.

235
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
In fact, right now I'll play up kind of the tension then between this sort of imperialist American

236
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:06,000
minister Fuller, who has a patent on the geodesic dome and MC Escher's son,

237
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
who's immigrated to Canada and is thinking he wants to get into the dome business.

238
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Now, where do I get the story?

239
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
It's from a published book by Siobhan Roberts called The King of Infinite Space,

240
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
and it's about Donald Coxeter.

241
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
He's also written a more recent bio of John Conway.

242
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:31,000
But in that Coxeter book, she talks about how Coxeter was living, angry.

243
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
When he found out that MC Escher's son was being frustrated about getting into the ray dome business,

244
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
in other words, building those domes across the Arctic Circle,

245
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
like smart young engineer maybe wants to get into that.

246
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Oh, but the Pentagon buys all its bucky domes from bucky.

247
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
All those geodesic domes, there's a patent on that.

248
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
And Coxeter's like, how do you patent the geometry of nature?

249
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
You know, this stuff occurs naturally.

250
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Geodesic domes, you can find them everywhere in nature.

251
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,000
And here's some American ego guy in the Pentagon who thinks he owns geodesic domes,

252
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
and he's not going to let MC Escher.

253
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
So, Coxeter develops a view of Fuller that he might not like Fuller.

254
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
And I'm saying this relationship evolves over time.

255
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:28,000
By the time Coxeter sees the Montreal Pavilion in 1967, he feels better about bucky.

256
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
It's like this really is beautiful architecture and this is a message of world peace and all this kind of stuff.

257
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
And their relationship continues to evolve.

258
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
But I'll never say it was very comfortable.

259
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,000
But I also want to say for the record that let me get to this important slide.

260
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I'm going forward now through all this.

261
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
See, the content of Synergetics, just to alert you to that, is very geometric.

262
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
So, I'm calling it a philosophical work in the humanities.

263
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I'm circling all that kind of stuff, as you've seen.

264
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,000
But then when we actually start looking at the pictures, at the figures, it's all very geometric, right?

265
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:23,000
And just what it's about is it's saying, I'd really like this tetrahedron embedded inside a cube to be my unit of volume.

266
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I'd really like that.

267
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
But this is never going to happen because the cube we're embedded in is second root of two on the edge.

268
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,000
So, obviously, the whole volume of this cube is second root of two to the third power.

269
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
That's the volume of the cube.

270
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:45,000
And there's a well-known theorem that the tetrahedron inscribed in a cube is a third the volume of that cube, right?

271
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
That's just general proof to knowledge and geometry.

272
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
So, if you're ever going to have that tetrahedron be volume one, the cube has to have volume three.

273
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:02,000
And it clearly doesn't because the edges are second root of two and second root of two to the third power is second root of two to the third power.

274
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
It's some crazy irrational numbers.

275
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
So, what are you talking about, Mr. Buckingford?

276
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Well, he's saying, I'm going to change the meaning of third and second power.

277
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,000
It's a growing tetrahedron that grows one eight twenty seven sixty four over here.

278
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,000
And so, when you raise something to the third power, picture a growing tetrahedron at that point.

279
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:32,000
And so, I'm going to grow my tetrahedron, this one inside here using this alternative model.

280
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
And therefore, my cube is going to have a different volume.

281
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,000
It's not going to be, we're no longer going to use the right angle to determine what we mean by third power.

282
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:50,000
And so, here you see a quote where he's saying school people all think of length, breadth and height as these three separate things.

283
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Like, oh, I can imagine height without widths.

284
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Oh, there's widths, no height.

285
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Okay, swap them.

286
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Okay, now there's height.

287
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
You know, what's the difference?

288
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
You really imagine them separately and floor is saying, no, let's not do that.

289
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Let's just have one space to rule them all and let's have the tetrahedron be its icon and not the cube.

290
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
And it has four faces, very four, very pronounced four.

291
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
You can get three out of it by drawing z's along the edges and stuff.

292
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
One, two, three, you get a z.

293
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Two z's make a tetrahedron.

294
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:30,000
There's your three dimensional intuition, but really, instead of going with the cube people, let's just start over, start fresh.

295
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
And have our tetrahedron be 40.

296
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:41,000
So when you come to synergetics, it's kind of like you're in search of the fourth dimension, but you're thinking 3d plus one, where's the fourth?

297
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
And in this world, you say, here's all four.

298
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
This is a four dimensional space, but you just can't keep your other three.

299
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
You're trading your car in for another car.

300
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
You're one, two, three, whatever, that's gone.

301
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
It's all 40.

302
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
It's all tetrahedron all the way down.

303
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Everything's a tetrahedron, right?

304
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
That doesn't bring time into it.

305
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
We've got to have rotation.

306
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
We've got to have change.

307
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
But kind of an aesthetic sense.

308
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,000
When you do that, when your tetrahedron's unit volume, you're octahedron with the same edge length as volume four.

309
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
You're space filling rhombic donut and you're in this volume six.

310
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Now that's with the long diagonal of each face.

311
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
The diamond faces, 12 of them.

312
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,000
They have long and short diagonals, crisscross, long diagonal, same as the edge of the tetrahedron volume six.

313
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Now these ratios are all there in XYZ.

314
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
We're not changing the math.

315
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,000
These ratios are there, but they're not teased out because our unit volume is the cube.

316
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
And the cube does not play well with others compared to tetrahedron.

317
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
And there is the cube volume three.

318
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
So we have a different meaning of powering.

319
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
We have an alternative.

320
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
It's very alien.

321
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
So I call this Martian math sometimes when I teach it to kids.

322
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
So you just have a Martian saying, you never learned this in school, right?

323
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
But check it out.

324
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,000
So now that the tetrahedron is volume one, we can section it up to fractional tetrahedron.

325
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
There's one called the A module.

326
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
And then there's another one called the B module that sits on top of the A module.

327
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:21,000
And those two together, if you take the left and right A and add a left or right B,

328
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
you can make what's called the mite, which is a space spilling tetrahedron.

329
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
And you may have heard that tetrahedron don't fill space.

330
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Well, that's true of the regular tetrahedron, but the various irregular tetrahedron do fill space.

331
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:43,000
And this is where Fuller overlaps with, I would say, everyday conventional math.

332
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
On the left side is a page out of a math journal, Journal of Pominentorial Theory.

333
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,000
And this is about, these are the plain nets of tetrahedron that do in fact fill space.

334
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:01,000
And along the bottom there are the names they would have if we were in the namespace of synergetics.

335
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,000
And the edges all match because edges don't tell you, I mean, you can expand it.

336
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
The shape is all that really matters here.

337
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Okay, so the last thing back to the Quadrate coordinates is how do we support this intuition that space is four-dimensional with something like the XYZ coordinates.

338
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
So imagine you're in high school.

339
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I'm talking to you and you've just learned a lot about XYZ.

340
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I show you this jack.

341
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
You say, yeah, that's what we've been learning about the XYZ coordinate system.

342
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Looks like a jack.

343
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
It's got the positive and negative of each of those three number lines, blah, blah.

344
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
And what we're using now over on the right is the Caltrop.

345
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Instead, in a way, you see it's more economical.

346
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
The Scott Fewer spokes, after all, right?

347
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I mean, everyone wants to say three-dimensional is the simplest world.

348
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:04,000
But when you look at the apparatus that comes with the XYZ, it's not as simple as the Caltrop.

349
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
So, you know, let's at least question it.

350
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Let's take it out and check it out.

351
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Let's go further.

352
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
So the thing is we can build the XYZ coordinates from the Quadrates.

353
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
It's not an either or a thing.

354
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:25,000
And that's the important aspect of all of this is that synergetics does not negate the old normal way of thinking.

355
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
XYZ is here to stay.

356
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
We're always going to have that.

357
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I'd call it the Mahayana of math, the Hilbert space math, Euclidean math, the E that I talked about back in the beginning here.

358
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
So where are we in my talk, Quadrates?

359
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I have Quadrates implemented in Python.

360
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
So students can download them and play with them interactively.

361
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
What that looks like using today's technology is something called Jupyter notebooks.

362
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
So here's like the source code for Quadrates.

363
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:05,000
And you have also source code for Tetraedrons, right?

364
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I can express the vertices of Tetraedrons using Quadrate coordinates if I like.

365
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Or I can convert back to XYZ doesn't matter.

366
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Either way, I have lengths like distances and those are the same between XYZ and IBM coordinates.

367
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:28,000
But I changed how I compute volume because as you saw, my third powering is no longer your third powering.

368
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:37,000
When I say your, I mean XYZ people, you XYZ people, you use a cube to say third powering and you always say three cubes.

369
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
You don't stop to think that that could have been a Tetraedron at some point in history.

370
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
It's too late now.

371
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Let's say synergetics will never be popular because we've already made our choice.

372
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Let's put it that way.

373
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
But had we gone this route, what would it have been like?

374
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
What would the math have been like?

375
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
That's an interesting question to ask.

376
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
And so we changed the way we compute volume.

377
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I'll show you quickly.

378
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I take a well-known formula from history and one that's not known at all.

379
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
This guy named Piero della Francesca in the 1400s.

380
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Just give me the six lengths of a Tetraedron and I'll give you back the volume through this complicated computation I'll do.

381
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Just give me the lengths.

382
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I'll give you the volume.

383
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Same deal from Cayley Manger.

384
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
That's our same Manger.

385
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
This uses a determinant.

386
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,000
And same deal from Gerald DeJean, except nobody knows about this one and he's lost his derivation.

387
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
But I used it for years.

388
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:45,000
So I have these three different ways of taking the six edges of a Tetraedron and returning the volume in what are called Tetra volumes.

389
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:56,000
So we're no longer using unit cubes when we talk about what is the volume of X or Y or shape A and shape B.

390
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
We're talking about the Tetra volumes thereof.

391
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
So this slide deck is all about quadrates.

392
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
And they're used.

393
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
So this I'll leave it this picture and see if there's questions at this point.

394
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
So here.

395
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Here we are using quadrate coordinates in the isotropic vector matrix, which has kind of a scaffolding role just like XYZ does.

396
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
And I'm saying two times two times five equals 20.

397
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
What do I mean by that?

398
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I just take the tips of those three vectors two times two times five and close the lid.

399
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I just, you know, add the fourth base and say that volume is equal to 20 of those little unit Tetraedrons.

400
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Now you'll notice this whole scaffolding is not solely made of unit Tetraedrons.

401
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
It's a combination of Tetraedrons and octahedrons.

402
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
So I patented as the octet truss.

403
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Again, the Imperial American patenting the geometry of nature, how dare he.

404
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
But what he was trying to show was, hey, I'm being pretty effective here.

405
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
My life to helping people.

406
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
And wow, I'm getting all these patents.

407
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Wow, look at me.

408
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I'm pretty cool.

409
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
So there's his side of it there too.

410
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:20,000
As to why he was so always trying to take credit for his thoughts because he was trying to prove a point, which is if you commit your life the way he did to serving all humanity.

411
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
And that's why he was different as a cold warrior.

412
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
He never really took the side of either the Russians or the Americans.

413
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
He's like, let me show you both how you can improve things.

414
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
And so, you know, that's a positive futurism.

415
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
He was a positive futurist.

416
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
And those are in high demand.

417
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:45,000
So to get real sophisticated, because you guys are math people, if you take a determinant, you just take the quadrace of four points in space.

418
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
So remember quadrace.

419
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
I don't think it's a Hilbert space because there's no right angles to the coordinates.

420
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
There's four tuples.

421
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
You lie them side down.

422
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
You lie them down the four coordinates, the four positions of any tetrahedron.

423
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
These are the four vertices of any tetrahedron.

424
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Compute this determinant.

425
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Take one fourth of that and you get your IBM volume, your tetrahedral volume of that state.

426
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,000
And interestingly, and I demonstrate this in Python for my high school audience.

427
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:30,000
If you pick any four spheres in a closest packed beer ocean, the IBM, pick any four spheres at random, connect them with the six edges and ask for the tetrahedron volume.

428
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
You always get a whole number.

429
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Interesting.

430
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
And this slide I'm showing out.

431
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Once you understand about quadrace, you can input the corners of what we call the A module shown in this picture.

432
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:50,000
There's the B module as quadrace, like the vertices are entered as quadrace.

433
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
And then we feed it to the formula I just showed you.

434
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
It constructs that determinant and computes the volume.

435
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
But the volume comes out what?

436
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,000
One twenty fourth because our unit of volume again is a tetrahedron.

437
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
You got to live in a world where the cube of unit edges does not have a rational volume.

438
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Oh my God.

439
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Oh my God.

440
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:19,000
So my view is, as a liberal Wittgenstein kind of guy, both these worlds coexist, namespaces coexist.

441
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:28,000
It's not a big deal that floors over here on the side with his subculture, evolving this whole different way of thinking and talking.

442
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
They use as a lot of the same words.

443
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Because in the end, we all want to use the same words.

444
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:42,000
You'll find philosophers who say things like, if you don't mean what I mean by gravity B, then you should be saying schmavity, right?

445
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
We get to use the real word, right?

446
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,000
But what I'm saying in my slides here is we all want to use the word vector.

447
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,000
So what I have this little acronym is like everyone wants to rule the world.

448
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
None of us want to deny ourselves access to these key words.

449
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
And the way we solve that in Python is we create what are called namespaces.

450
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
They solved it in Java as well.

451
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:14,000
But it's a way to create sandboxes where we all get to use the same words, but we don't have to mean the same thing.

452
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
There's no one namespace to rule them all.

453
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
We didn't need that.

454
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
We don't have it.

455
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Okay.

456
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
That ends my talk.

457
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
So in a way, y'all can ask anything.

458
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
I got the Cheshire cat in there.

459
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:46,000
The thing about dimensions is when we say they don't exist independently of each other, that's kind of the critique going back to that slide.

460
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
We're saying you can't have heights without depth.

461
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Like, can you?

462
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I mean, the book Flatland has been very, very, very influential and we convince ourselves that we can be two-dimensional in that.

463
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
But what is that really like?

464
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Aren't you looking down?

465
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
If you're looking down on a square, you're in space.

466
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
You're looking down on a piece of paper.

467
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
So forget that.

468
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:17,000
You can't actually collapse what I call res extensa into two dimensions experientially.

469
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
This is what Fuller is saying.

470
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Once.

471
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
And if you start from there, how does it get to be three and not four?

472
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:33,000
And so for it's an odd to feel that somebody would debate you that when you say space is three-dimensional, what we're used to is take that for granted.

473
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
We learned that in elementary school.

474
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:44,000
And now you have adults coming in the room and saying, well, we're going to say four-dimensional because we like to touch region more than the cube.

475
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
It's like, well, that's weird.

476
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
I'm not used to that.

477
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
But I would say, therefore, make it seem like an Asian thing.

478
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
I use a Sanskrit here, dependent origination.

479
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
All the dimensions are there at once.

480
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
You can't have one without the others.

481
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
There's no height without breadth.

482
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Anyway, that's kind of the rhetoric you want to sample.

483
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
And what I'm saying is you don't have to give up on any of these.

484
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
You can always switch between them.

485
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
None of them are going anywhere.

486
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Which is right?

487
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Which camp am I in?

488
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Do I have to be a champion of one or the other?

489
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
It's no.

490
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I'd use machine learning.

491
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I love the 3D stuff.

492
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
I teach that stuff.

493
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
So these are the three namespaces I'm talking about.

494
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
And just to recap the relationships.

495
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Fuller really admired Einstein and wanted to write a book about Einstein.

496
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Call it Nine Chases of the Moon.

497
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
And this is early.

498
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Before the atomic bombs is before Oppenheimer.

499
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000
And Einstein, everyone's endeared with this Einstein guy, including Fuller,

500
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
but it doesn't have the ominousness yet.

501
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
And Fuller writes kind of a lighthearted book called Nine Chases of the Moon,

502
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
which got Arthur C. Clark's attention at some point.

503
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
And they say to Fuller, look, you're nobody.

504
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
What are you writing about Einstein?

505
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
You've got to be a genius to write about Einstein.

506
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
There's about five people in the world who are allowed to write about Einstein.

507
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Who do you think you are?

508
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
So Fuller took the, not to be so easily discouraged,

509
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
he sent his manuscript to Einstein.

510
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
And he got a call and he gets to go to Einstein.

511
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
And there's this play about Bucky Fuller.

512
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
It's a monologue play.

513
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
One actor does the whole thing with the scene where he's ushered in

514
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
and he gets to sit down with Einstein.

515
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
It's like Fuller is starstruck.

516
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
And Einstein is like, young man, you surprised me.

517
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,000
I never thought there'd be anything like practical or interesting to say about my work.

518
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
You know, in the everyday world.

519
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
But here you've shown blah, blah, and you have my blessing.

520
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
So Fuller got to be on the list of people who could write those kind of books.

521
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
It's not very technical.

522
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
It's, you know, Nine Chases of the Moon.

523
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
He admitted later he was drinking a lot of time when he wrote that.

524
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
But it's a really pretty interesting book.

525
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
So the relationship between Coxeter and Einstein.

526
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
I'm saying, given three people here, let's get to the relationships.

527
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Coxeter is at pains in this quote to say, my way of doing 4D, extended Euclideanism,

528
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
is not the same as Einstein's.

529
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Let's not confuse them.

530
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
And I don't think enough is done to help Coxeter make this point.

531
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,000
A lot of people would not identify extended Euclideanism with Coxeter in particular.

532
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
I mainly do that because University of Toronto,

533
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,000
but also because Fuller dedicates his synergetics to Coxeter.

534
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:48,000
So I've used that in my shot talk to use the name Coxeter is to stand for Gilbert space,

535
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Euclidean extended Euclidean, any number of dimensions, whatever, ND geometry.

536
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,000
And he's saying this is not the same as what Einstein is doing with Minkowski space stuff like that.

537
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
So he's eager to make the distinction.

538
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
And what I'm saying is once you take him at his word that those two are different,

539
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
then you've realized that 4D can appear in these two whole different namespaces

540
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
and mean completely different things.

541
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:18,000
And that can be very confusing to a layperson if they've not encountered the doctrine of namespaces.

542
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Now, thankfully, they're learning Python in droves.

543
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,000
It's getting easier for people to tease apart the fact that when I say vector or God or something,

544
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,000
it may not be in the same namespace as we're used to.

545
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,000
And then so once I've got room for two, it's easier to wedge in Fuller and say,

546
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
yeah, but he published late.

547
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
People didn't learn about him.

548
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
And so that's why he's very obscure.

549
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,000
And so you came to our very elite school in the Silicon Forest where we do teach this stuff.

550
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
We kind of make fun of other people who don't, right?

551
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
This is my bookshelves as current.

552
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
So I just took these pictures recently.

553
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,000
You can see I've got a little bit of category theory there with Chang's book.

554
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:14,000
You know, I'm studying that language because I kind of want to know how this can be translated into category theory.

555
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:20,000
The so-called beast modules, B-E-A-S-T, those are just tetrahedral wedges.

556
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
I've already shown you the A and the B. This is the S.

557
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:30,000
The S nestles between the octahedron of volume four and it's contained the icosahedron.

558
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,000
And their 24 S modules added to that icosahedron gives you the octahedron.

559
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Again, this nesting relationship is not new with Bucky.

560
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Bucky is basically saying, don't just throw the polyhedron out on a table unrelated to each other.

561
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Their full didactic value comes from converging them into some kind of nest.

562
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
And a lot of people have that insight.

563
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
It's not enough to have polyhedra. You want to see how they relate to each other.

564
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
So we do that. We have this concentric hierarchy of polyhedra.

565
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
So there's the S modules in terms of a plane net.

566
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Again, this is directly from Synergetics.

567
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,000
But when we compute the volume of it, we're not using standard XYZ math.

568
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,000
We're using what I showed you earlier. So there's the links.

569
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,000
And when I get out the volume, it's going to fit in our volumes table.

570
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
And we can express that volume.

571
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:31,000
The volume in the tetra volumes of the S module is five to the negative fifth over two.

572
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
So we have a very five based, very interesting.

573
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
There's the S module 3D printed by up.

574
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
That's S and then edges expanded by five.

575
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
So volume up to the third power.

576
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
So the beast modules is where we are.

577
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,000
And here's our volumes table overall, right?

578
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:57,000
So the tetraegrin is one and I'm using very high precision, not just floating points.

579
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
And I'm using actual algebraic expressions out on the right.

580
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
So our icosahedron is valued differently.

581
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,000
All the volumes have a different value, but there's a constant ratio between them called the Synergetics constant.

582
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
So when you go from the XYZ world to the IBM world,

583
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
all the changes is somehow the model of third powering.

584
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
And then all your volumes shift, but by a constant value.

585
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
So it's really very, very simple.

586
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
This is not tough stuff.

587
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
That's partly why it can fly in and say high school level.

588
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,000
But there might be a way to introduce category theory, let these modules,

589
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
these wedges morph into each other.

590
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
The A turns into the B.

591
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
These A, B, and T, by the way, all have the same volume, one over 24.

592
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
And then there's the E and the S.

593
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Those are the four of five modules, tetraegrin wedges that we study.

594
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Once we've absorbed a little paradigm of unit volume, tetraegrin, concentric hierarchy, like that,

595
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,000
then we break the tetraegrin into pieces, shatter some other stuff.

596
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,000
And we get these vocabulary of five basic wedges.

597
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,000
And I kind of showed you how two of them, the A and the B, can be used to make the mites,

598
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:19,000
which is one of the space-filling tetrahedra, known to conventional XYZ math world,

599
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
but by a different name.

600
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Well, it's a lot about nomenclature.

601
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Who dares to call the A module an A module?

602
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,000
And can we call it something else if we're not interested in getting fuller's names?

603
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:40,000
And in further circulation, we must stop use of A to mean this A module and so forth.

604
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Thank you, Kirby.

605
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Yep.

606
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Shanna or Dean, go for it first.

607
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Dean, go first.

608
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
You want me to go?

609
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Okay, yeah, Kirby, just thank you so much for that incredible talk.

610
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Yeah, we could start some categorical, synergetical, you know, bankings.

611
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
I had a question.

612
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
If you go back to the geometry of lumps slide.

613
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Sure.

614
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Where that was.

615
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Just have to make the right slide that.

616
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Yeah.

617
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
I'm almost there.

618
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
That one.

619
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Let's see.

620
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
More with a systematic character of prime thinkability.

621
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Where's that one?

622
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
This one.

623
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Yeah, we have the actual like 1071.00, the kind of fuller slide.

624
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Fuller slide, got it.

625
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Okay.

626
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
This one.

627
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Yeah, it says geometry of lumps in the first.

628
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Okay, I got you.

629
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Prime thinkability.

630
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
No, you're right on.

631
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Totally good memory.

632
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Very cool.

633
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
All right.

634
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
No, I know that's not it.

635
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Let's just go one by one.

636
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
I can tell you ask it without the thing.

637
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Yeah.

638
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Cool.

639
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Since you're like, you know, fuller expert, I want to ask,

640
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:24,000
the systematic realization slide where he says all imaging

641
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
derives from experience.

642
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
So since we're sitting here talking about math art fronts,

643
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,000
I want to know what you think that, what do you think that is?

644
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
What you think he's doing with that?

645
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Could you have an image without an experience?

646
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Because he's adding frequency to what he calls the,

647
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,000
you know, mathematical, undemonstrable something.

648
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
So just wondering what you, what's your take on all imaging

649
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
derives from experience?

650
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Well,

651
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:02,000
I think if we took away what you couldn't get from experience,

652
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
like we can extrapolate from experience.

653
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:11,000
We like, people say I can experience a perfect circle and then you close

654
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
your mind or close your eyes and say, I'm doing it right now.

655
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
I'm now picturing a perfect circle.

656
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
And it's like, there's no one really there to contradict you

657
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
or there's no peer review in that sense.

658
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
I'm thinking he means public.

659
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,000
He means we all get our private authority from shared public space.

660
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
So if you think you see something that's totally non experiential,

661
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
how are you going to communicate it?

662
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
And at some point it becomes experiential.

663
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:45,000
It's like our experience in math is very strong, right?

664
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,000
It's not like we don't feel and sense, right?

665
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
So that's experiential too.

666
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:58,000
So when I say experiential, it's not about discounting other than visualization,

667
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
which he associates, by the way, with Euler.

668
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,000
He associates the spatial visual imaginary.

669
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:10,000
You could call that Eulerian and just for fun to try that on.

670
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,000
And then the visceral, like when you just tactile feel,

671
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,000
like your emotions, you can almost say that he associates with Gibbs,

672
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:25,000
tactile, vectorial energy flows of that kind of being on a roller coaster.

673
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Visceral sense.

674
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Anyway, just extrapolating.

675
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
It's a language, partly why it's two volumes.

676
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,000
And there's also a synergetics dictionary for volumes,

677
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
all done with help from Avaloy who would collate everything Bucky said,

678
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:46,000
because he did have, I would say, kind of unmoored meanings for his words,

679
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,000
not just frequency, not just what you're reading here,

680
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
but when he talks about radiation and gravity,

681
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,000
it's like you say, wait a minute, this is your own private language, isn't it?

682
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
And in a way, yeah, in a way it is.

683
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
That's partly it.

684
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Yeah, Daniel.

685
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Yeah, on that quote, just a few possible active inference connections,

686
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
all imaging derives from experience.

687
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
So that's kind of like the projective consciousness

688
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
or the screen type visualizations that we've been discussing.

689
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,000
And then also the next line, I think points towards cognitive modeling,

690
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:26,000
because it's saying, you can abstract, you can abstract to negative dimensions,

691
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,000
zero, one, two, three, you can think slash do anything.

692
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:36,000
However, that experience will be a cognitive systematic situation.

693
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,000
So that's kind of an embodied or a historical approach to math operations,

694
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:47,000
which is like, yes, a mathematician can imagine an infinitesimal

695
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
as the basis of continuity in a line, they can,

696
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
and they're not wrong within that namespace world.

697
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:00,000
However, that is happening on the organism's cognitive interface.

698
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:09,000
I think because of my Wittgenstein background, again, later Wittgenstein,

699
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:16,000
it's not required for a term to be meaningful for it to have a reference

700
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
so that it actually points to something.

701
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
So you can have a language that's chock full of meaning.

702
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
And yet it doesn't really point to anything.

703
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
And I take my analogy of driving a car.

704
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,000
The steering wheel is as much part of the language game as the signage,

705
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
the striped lines, everything about the road.

706
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,000
In fact, where language begins and everything else ends, there is no line.

707
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:43,000
So it's all just, you know, language, you could say the whole car, everything.

708
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
And that's kind of an operational deal of language.

709
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:54,000
And in that sense, I don't say, well, you know, really the job is to line up

710
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
your words with the essence of things.

711
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:01,000
You know, that's kind of the Western metaphysics is if we dig down deep enough,

712
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,000
we'll find the essence of the word logic or the essence of the word dimension.

713
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
And it's our job to find that.

714
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,000
And in the Wittgenstein sense, no, it's our job to create language games

715
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
that hold together until they don't, right?

716
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:22,000
It's like name spaces come and go like sand castles on the beach, right?

717
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:27,000
It's like, it's not necessary to decide which one is quote true, right?

718
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
They're forms of life.

719
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
So that's why I'm thinking when I talk about these branches and different uses

720
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,000
of the word dimension and so on, I'm saying, you know, there's friendships here.

721
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Coxeter and Bucky ended up being friends.

722
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Einstein and Bucky admired each other.

723
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
I'm sure Coxeter admired Einstein.

724
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:50,000
There's nothing to keep us as human beings from jumping around between these,

725
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:56,000
but it's a little difficult to do because of the required gestalt shifts

726
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,000
when you jump from say XYZ apparatus into IVM coordinates

727
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,000
and go from three tuples to four tuples is going to be jarring, right?

728
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
But then after a while it gets smooth, right?

729
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:14,000
I think it helps understand XYZ to jump into quadrace, for example.

730
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,000
I don't see them as, I don't see one as hurting the other.

731
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
I see them as two APIs to the same means.

732
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,000
And what I didn't show just real quick is once we are using quadrace,

733
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:32,000
we can get whole number coordinates for all the spheres and closest packing.

734
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
So I start with a nuclear ball.

735
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,000
I do a layer of 12 around it, a layer of 42 around that,

736
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
another layer of 92, another layer of 162.

737
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
As I grow this outward, creating the CCP,

738
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,000
I can just use 12 permutations of my original basis vectors.

739
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
In other words, once you start with a quadrace,

740
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,000
take two of one, one of any other two and none of a third or fourth

741
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,000
and do all 12 permutations of that and you now have the hops you need

742
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,000
to the neighboring spheres around the sphere you're in, the 12 around one.

743
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:11,000
And linear combinations of those directions, therefore on the right you see

744
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:17,000
all whole number integer, positive integer addressing for CCP space,

745
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
whereas in XYZ we don't have it, it's not that nice.

746
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
So there are practical uses for this.

747
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:29,000
I would say graphic arts people really need to know about the concentric hierarchy.

748
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Adding quadrace, for example, if you just add triples of quadrace,

749
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
you get the opposite tetrahedron, right?

750
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,000
You get the inverse intersected dual, the tetrahedron's dual of itself.

751
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:49,000
You can get the cubes vertices from the quadrace

752
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
because you've got the dual tetrahedron.

753
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
So those two together make a cube.

754
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Same octetron rhombic data.

755
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
In other words, this diagram on the right says it all.

756
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:05,000
A through Z, all those points can be reached with very simple sums of the quadrace.

757
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,000
And I feel like when we jump into the swimming pool, we come out smarter

758
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
and we're better able to understand XYZ as well.

759
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Thank you, Kirby. Dean and Jim.

760
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Well, thanks, Daniel.

761
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,000
I have a question for you around.

762
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:31,000
It's a bit of a fork from some of the stuff that you have in the slides here.

763
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:39,000
I'm wondering around the learning aspect of four-dimensional awareness

764
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
and understanding and acknowledgement.

765
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
There are a lot of relationships out there.

766
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:52,000
I'm sure I have a relationship with the fish swimming around in the lake in front of my cabin right now,

767
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:57,000
but I don't necessarily acknowledge that until I bump into them or whatever.

768
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:04,000
And I think in a lot of learning centers on what we choose to acknowledge

769
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
and what we just ignore or it's put in the background, right?

770
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
So this isn't a, we're all related.

771
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
We're all one kind of thing.

772
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Of course we are, but the learning is in what matters in that particular situation or context

773
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:23,000
in which we're trying to expand or maybe contract our model, right?

774
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:33,000
So my question is around the idea that the synergetics forks off of relativity

775
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:40,000
or still in that relationship forward dimension

776
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,000
and less Bucky the savior and more Bucky the man

777
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:51,000
by not taking a math or art, i.e. a Cold War side as relationship,

778
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
was Bucky a bit of a turd-disturber?

779
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
What was that? A turd-disturber?

780
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Yeah, I'm trying to be, I'm trying to be polite, Kirby.

781
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:09,000
I think he was a maverick and he did stir the pot and he was controversial

782
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:17,000
and he caused a lot of, still to this day, all kinds of controversy swirling around fuller.

783
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:24,000
I think the only way to explain why something as straightforward and interesting as I just went through

784
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:33,000
is so esoteric and unknown has to be more than just, oh, I'm going to ignore it.

785
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
I think no, I'm going to actively suppress it.

786
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:43,000
I'm not saying you, I'm just saying Fuller felt this himself that he was going to be forgotten in a hurry

787
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,000
and I think it was partly because of that way he played the Cold War.

788
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,000
He was not taking sides and that doesn't make you popular even today, right?

789
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:57,000
So he had enemies, detractors.

790
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:02,000
And like Kenneth Snelson, if you're into the lore, you know, about that rival where he just real quick,

791
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:09,000
I think people need to deal with my story more and I've got, you know, I've got, this could seem self-serving,

792
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
but I get more into where I put myself in the picture here.

793
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Kaufman, Rorty, stuff like that, bits into Bucky stuff.

794
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,000
I'm saying I was Kenneth Snelson's first webmaster.

795
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,000
I was also the Buckmaster Fuller's first webmaster.

796
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
So like here we are in the next generation.

797
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,000
If you want to write about another book about synergetics, you should talk to me, right?

798
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Because there's all these books coming out still where they don't even mention the beast modules.

799
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:44,000
And my feeling is the boomers skipped Bucky.

800
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Like they went to his lectures and they applauded and, oh, nice pat on the head, you're a good guy.

801
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:56,000
You want the world to be a better place, but we're not going to pay any attention to the mathematics.

802
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,000
And I'm one of the boomers, but I'm telling downline generations.

803
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
I think my fellow boomers made a mistake.

804
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
This was worth keeping.

805
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
And I think my downliners get that.

806
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,000
So this art by Casey House is not by me, but we're going to have a good culture.

807
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Cultural renaissance as people recover the damage done by the boomers.

808
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
So can I just do a quick follow up?

809
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Of course, you're looking at things as math art and we are not picking sides.

810
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Should we anticipate that there are going to be a whole bunch of people out there who are going to bounce on this and hate?

811
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
No.

812
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,000
No, I don't think I think we're past that now.

813
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,000
That might have been true at one point, but I don't think we're in that time.

814
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,000
I think this stuff will smoothly gain traction.

815
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:01,000
But in general, though, I do think art isn't neutral.

816
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:11,000
In other words, propagandists on all sides use the tools of art to persuade art as a tool of persuasion, as well as just isn't this pretty.

817
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:17,000
So, you know, I pay attention to that.

818
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,000
But I think Fuller's stuff right now is in good shape.

819
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Like we're not worried, right?

820
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Maybe at one point.

821
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
But this stuff, you know, I get to teach this.

822
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
I'm online a lot.

823
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,000
People love it.

824
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,000
It's like I'm not having much push back.

825
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,000
So if that answers it all, like I'm not encountering any vicious anger.

826
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Myself.

827
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000
As I push forward.

828
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Seems like the coast is clear.

829
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Come on in the water is fine.

830
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
And we need more math talent or art talent.

831
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Like Casey House here.

832
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
I can't do anything quite this pretty.

833
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
My animations.

834
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:06,000
It's not like it's just me, but like I sense a lack of good computer graphics still around a lot of this stuff.

835
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,000
So I'm recruiting.

836
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
I'm just trying to make sure that I'm in good shape mode.

837
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Hey, if you're listening and you want to help bring your art skills over here and help us, that kind of thing.

838
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Keep our 4D alive in this lineage, right?

839
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,000
I love all of these.

840
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,000
They're all good.

841
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
I didn't put S ahead for any reason.

842
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
I wasn't trying to mean anything.

843
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Just trying to make room here.

844
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
And I'm not saying these are the only branches or anything like that.

845
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Just saying here's a triangle we can make.

846
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,000
You can forget about synergetics.

847
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,000
It's not important if you want to take, there'll be enough people.

848
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:48,000
So if you don't want to jump on the boat, don't feel coerced is another message while I have the floor.

849
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Thank you.

850
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Again, it's not either or I'm a teacher of ordinary XYZ math a lot, right?

851
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,000
As a calculus teacher.

852
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:06,000
So quickly, like I grew up in Portland, Oregon, my dad's an urban planner.

853
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:11,000
But he always wants to work overseas, not in the highly developed first world, so to speak.

854
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:18,000
He's trained as a PhD planner at the University of Chicago, wants to work overseas and quote developing countries.

855
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:27,000
So even though we were settling down in Portland, Oregon for a cushy middle class lifestyle, when the call came, how'd you like to work in Libya?

856
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
He's like, yeah, that's what I'm for.

857
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Let's go.

858
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Now that turned out to be cushy anyway, because the family gets to live in Italy and Rome.

859
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:42,000
So I grew up in Rome through eighth grade, go to high school in the Philippines, go to Princeton East Coast for a while.

860
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
And now I'm back in Portland, Oregon.

861
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
So I'm kind of expat.

862
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
And my dad was freelance.

863
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,000
So sometimes he worked for the US government and sometimes not.

864
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,000
He was on the payroll of the Egyptians when they lived in Cairo for years.

865
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:04,000
So after I left the family ship, as I say, they were in the Philippines, I go to Princeton, they keep moving around.

866
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
So my parents live in Cairo for many years.

867
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
They end up in Bhutan in the Himalayas.

868
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
And I go stay with them there for many years.

869
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
So I have an interesting bio.

870
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:22,000
I play that card like I want people to use my like we use Bucky's life.

871
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Bucky knew a lot of people.

872
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
He was very gregarious.

873
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
And he didn't mind writing letters to whoever.

874
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:35,000
So a new book about Bucky called Inventor of the Future by Alec Navalou Lee.

875
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,000
I see we're about at time here.

876
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,000
So let me just end.

877
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,000
It's a really good bio.

878
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
And Alec is kind of a skeptic.

879
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
He's not an acolyte.

880
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
He's not doing hagiography for Bucky.

881
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
This book is a skeptical look at Bucky.

882
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,000
And I think that's fine.

883
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:59,000
What it really shows, though, is how you can use this life as a guidebook to the 20th century.

884
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
And a lot of intellectual history will unfold.

885
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:09,000
So I guess what I'm saying is I thank the mathematicians for looking in on what we're doing.

886
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:14,000
But a lot of what I'm doing here is prepping kids in American history.

887
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Right. They need to know transcendentalists, how it goes towards Bucky and, you know, all this stuff's literature.

888
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Whether you get it in math class or not.

889
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
But I'd like you to get it in math class.

890
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,000
And I'd like math class to use Python.

891
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Because I don't think we should be teaching math without a computer.

892
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
But that's just me.

893
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000
I have a whole other stick on that.

894
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Thank you, Kirby.

895
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Jim, last question.

896
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Thanks, Kirby, for the talk.

897
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
And I want to ask you a question.

898
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,000
So if tetrahedron is the basis unit for our 4D system,

899
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,000
then what do you think the 5D system will be?

900
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Or even higher dimension?

901
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,000
That's a great question.

902
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:02,000
In Fuller's own synergetics, and this is partly why I say he branches off Einstein more than off of Coxeter

903
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,000
or off of extended Euclideanism,

904
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
is Fuller immediately turns to talk of time.

905
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,000
When he considers fifth dimension, sixth dimension,

906
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,000
he does want the word dimension to continue to do work in his synergetics.

907
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:20,000
And he's got lots of passages using that word.

908
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
At one point, though, there's a passage where he says,

909
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
this word dimension I'm paraphrasing is just too slippery.

910
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,000
I'm not going to use it anymore.

911
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,000
I'm going to use the word power.

912
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,000
And then he starts doing stuff with power right after that.

913
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000
And that's a very interesting passage.

914
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:39,000
But he has what I call New Year's resolutions in his writing where he resolves pounds of table.

915
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,000
I'm never going to say polyhedron again.

916
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
It's going to be polyvertexion from now on.

917
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Yeah, right.

918
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
New Year's resolution.

919
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:56,000
But your question is, tell me again if the tetrahedron is the basis.

920
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Yeah, what would be the fifth dimension?

921
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:07,000
For you guys, let me say you guys in a, I don't mean to box you in,

922
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,000
but as Hilbert space extended Euclideans,

923
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,000
because this is a path you're on.

924
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:16,000
After this talk, your talks will continue on that path, I think.

925
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
What's a 4D tesseract?

926
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
In other words, what's a tetrahedron in 4D?

927
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,000
I do the same thing I do with a cube, right?

928
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:28,000
I draw a smaller one inside a bigger one and connect the corners.

929
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,000
And what do I call that?

930
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:34,000
If a tesseract is a 4D cube, what do I call a 4D tetrahedron?

931
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:39,000
And why XYZ people isn't that tetrahedron important to you?

932
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
In other words, you really into that tesseract.

933
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Why not the tetrahedron and its 4D version?

934
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
What does it look like?

935
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Why don't you talk about that more?

936
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Because the tetrahedron is clearly simpler than the cube.

937
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,000
You're way too into the cube.

938
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
That's, you know, coming from an alien way out their view.

939
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Thank you, Kirby, Dean, Jim, Shanna.

940
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Been fun.

941
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,000
All right.

942
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:10,000
I hope you guys all stay in touch and we keep working on this.

943
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,000
We need help.

944
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Thank you.

945
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Thanks, Kirby.

946
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Till Math Art 5.

947
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Thank you.

948
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Thank you.
