1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
to copy or not to copy. That is the question from chimpanzees to the foundation of human

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:13,200
technological culture, recently appeared in physics of life reviews. Let me see if this works. Yeah,

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:20,960
sorry. So it all starts with a jigsaw puzzle. And the puzzle is why a highly innovative species

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:27,040
like chimpanzees do not live in a complex technological world. So we know chimpanzees are

5
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:32,400
very inventive. They are very creative. They are insightful. They can learn socially.

6
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:41,120
But what we don't see in the same extent or similar extent we see in humans is the accumulation

7
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,720
of complexity across generations. So you can see here in these images, we have one of the more

8
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:52,800
complex and demanding tasks that chimpanzees perform, cracking nuts open, and they can combine

9
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,920
different tools. They can use it in the appropriate order. So this means they are very insightful.

10
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:04,400
And yet, if we compare it with a rocket that can bring civilization to Mars,

11
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,960
it is clear that the accumulation of technology across generation works very differently in humans

12
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:19,520
and other non-human species. So the basic question or the one million dollar question is why does

13
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,720
innovation fail to translate into technological cumulative complexity in chimpanzees?

14
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,040
Does it owe to a limited capacity to copy with fidelity? Or what we referred

15
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,040
as true imitation, which means reproducing not only the end result that would be emulating

16
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,720
or emulation, but also the steps that lead to that end result. So according to this view,

17
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:49,680
further to copy innovation with faithful accuracy, hampers their intra and intergenerational spread,

18
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,680
and any ensuing ratcheting up effects. So possibly when copying with fidelity is impeded,

19
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,040
innovative performances are unlikely to lift their protagonist. And this brings us back to the

20
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,800
discussion we had the other day in The Snakes and Others paper where we said that after two

21
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:14,960
million years ago, Iriomo produced these almond-shamed bifacili flaked stones. But these

22
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:22,880
kind of artifacts that we don't even dare to call them tools were not copied by

23
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:28,240
conspecific observers because perhaps they were not attributing to them any kind of functional

24
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:36,240
use. So perhaps they were not seen as tools and were the result of manual inactions.

25
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:46,080
So to ratchet up complexity, it is important that inventions, that is tools, are copied with

26
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,800
sufficient fidelity so that they retain the fundamental features or attributes that make

27
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,920
them functional. So following the steps of demonstrated tool manufactured by an expert

28
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:02,320
model to the letter is the simplest, fastest and cheapest way to make sure that copies of the

29
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:10,640
original artifact are accurate. And here cheapest we refer to in terms of expenditure of energy.

30
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:17,680
So if the copies are functional, hence useful, they keep circulating in the group community

31
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,760
longer. And these skills increase the opportunities for one or more individuals different from the

32
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:30,160
original inventor to add in complexity. So for example, one individual invents a wooden spur

33
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:37,200
and 100 years later the smelting of copper is discovered and another individual adds to it

34
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,480
to this spur a sharp copper point and so on.

35
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:50,640
So here is an interesting concept of ratchet effect that would explain in part why humans

36
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:56,880
have built such complex cultural and technological work. So the idea of the ratchet effect is that

37
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:02,480
no generation starts from scratch. Instead, inventions and cultural products created by

38
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:08,480
one generation are kept in mind and transmitted to the next generation. This way, every generation

39
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:14,560
is better off supposedly than the one that preceded it. So here we can think of books,

40
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:22,480
books are a wonderful way of keeping information, sharing it across generations and among the same

41
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:29,120
generation also. So thus technological complexity and success in humans is not dependent solely

42
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,960
on the geniality of one or few individuals. It is a joint endeavor where many individuals

43
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:40,400
contributed specific expertise and skills to produce increasingly complex artifacts.

44
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:48,080
And again, we can think in establishing a colony in Mars, no single human alive could achieve that

45
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,760
alone or we have the required expertise to achieve that alone, but all together we can

46
00:04:53,760 --> 00:05:00,640
perhaps manage that. So we need this kind of shared knowledge and accumulated accretion of course.

47
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:11,120
So why it is some behaviors or innovation are copied or not can be explained at the level of

48
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:17,120
social dynamics but also at the level of the brain or giving a more mechanistic explanation.

49
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,520
So explanation of why coping of certain behavior in chimpanzees does not occur with frequency

50
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,880
have been often kept at the level of social dynamics where factors such as social prestige,

51
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:33,040
dominance, etc. are said to be key to explaining whether or not an invention is adopted by observers.

52
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:38,480
And this is a problem against the brain to a subsidiary role. Here, Michael and I will

53
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:44,000
be attempting to identify what the minimum cognitive requirements are that can give rise

54
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,720
to innovations and their horizontal and vertical transmission. And we also attempted to differentiate

55
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:56,960
the cognitive ingredients necessary for innovation from those that need to be in place for the adoption

56
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:02,080
of an innovation. So we wanted to establish a clear demarcation between the brains of the

57
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,840
ones that innovate and the brains of those who observe an innovation because we think this

58
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:15,760
is important to be analyzed separately. So in order to see which are the mechanisms

59
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:21,680
at the level of the brain that would allow for one innovation to be copied, we invoked

60
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:28,480
the lens of the free energy principle. According to active inference under the free energy principle,

61
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:34,000
it is through there being limited to a certain number of states that is the attracting set

62
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,080
that organisms minimize the variational free energy of the internal states and resist entropic

63
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:46,320
dissipation. Minimizing variation of free energy reduces prediction sensation discrepancies,

64
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:52,240
prediction errors that can be corrected by active sampling of predicted sensory inputs

65
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,760
and perceptive modification of predictions. This is sometimes expressed in terms of perceptual

66
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:04,320
inference that is changing predictions to mad sensations and active inference reactively

67
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:14,480
changing sensations to match predictions. So innovation in a way might represent a potential

68
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:19,680
misfireings from a Darwinian perspective. So minimizing variational free energy can be achieved

69
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,560
through action, sending creatures can act, active inference in order to fulfill their predictions

70
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,480
and thereby reduce discrepancy between the latter and sample reality.

71
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:34,960
Being limited to a certain number of states, what we could refer to as the attracting set,

72
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:41,200
is therefore synonymous with minimizing variational free energy and hence maximizing adaptive fitness.

73
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:48,080
Here innovation represents an anomaly and innovators are unorthodox actors or protagonists

74
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:54,000
who entertain new courses of action or plans. New phenotypical responses that have not been

75
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,760
previously entertained and according to this interpretation of the free energy principle,

76
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,680
it is at the level of policy selection where innovators stand apart from the crowd.

77
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:10,000
Their policy selection is in a sense faulty insofar as their ensuing behavioral outcomes are

78
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,080
in more contrast to those of their fellow actors who deploy orthodox responses that reduce discrepancies

79
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:21,600
between predictions and sensations thereby reducing the prediction error. Here when we talk

80
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:27,120
of misfireings, we don't do it in a kind of negative sense, it's just to express that

81
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,800
these new behaviors, these innovations necessarily will produce more surprise.

82
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:43,360
Okay, seeing surprising things, with this phrase I am kind of paraphrasing Andy Clark

83
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:49,360
in a paper in Behavioral and Brain Sciences. He referred to seeing surprising things to being

84
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:55,040
able to lend credibility to the sensory information that is not in accordance to prior beliefs.

85
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,520
So the family of priority density is entertained by an individual irrestricted to the systems,

86
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:07,200
the brains prior by some beliefs. Equivalent, roughly speaking, to its phenotypical repertoire.

87
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:14,000
This means by definition that innovative behaviors both are likely to be missed in any given phenotype

88
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,080
and, crucially, difficult to recognize when observed by another.

89
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:25,040
Should an innovator's behavior diverge markedly from the repertoire of plausible policies used

90
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:30,720
usually by an observer to predict another's behavior, it may be beyond the capacity of

91
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:37,760
the latter's generative model to recognize it, that is, to make sense of it. So large discrepancies

92
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:44,240
pose a threat to the brain, because one, updating involves making energetic demands, and two,

93
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:49,840
risk-reducing adaptive fitness by inappropriately changing the generative models. And here we

94
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:54,880
need to think that the generative model has been selected also in a specific economy, so changing

95
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:04,720
it might have risks. Okay. So what is required for a brain to entertain generative models that

96
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:11,600
involve unusual or bizarre behaviors? The hierarchical predictive interpretation of the brain,

97
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:18,080
or hierarchically mechanistic mind, an amphibious inference machine, sorry, implies that each level

98
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:23,280
of the hierarchy of cerebral neuronal circuits conveys predictions or conditional expectations

99
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:28,960
that suppress errors at the level below, while concurrently conveying errors that permit the

100
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:36,080
revision of the expectations at the level above. Possibly, dynamical precision weighting enables

101
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:41,600
the system, that is, the brain, to readjust the confidence afforded to top-down expectations

102
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,840
as opposed to bottom-up prediction errors. In other words, in order to entertain a prior

103
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:53,760
data and likely hypothesis might explain best some behavior within us, it is first necessary to

104
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:59,200
relax the precision or commitment to prior beliefs, thus enabling new or implausible

105
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:08,400
hypotheses to explain novel behavior. And here I introduce some things we discussed the other day,

106
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,480
Professor Freiston talk of attenuation of sensory information in relation to

107
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:18,560
saccades, which is kind of switching off the sensory information we are being aware of,

108
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:27,680
and that would be the opposite as being impressionable. So I'm quoting Professor Freiston here.

109
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:34,240
If I can copy, that means I am impressionable. I will accumulate new evidence very quickly.

110
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,280
I have the capacity to assign greater evidence or precision to sensory evidence and suspend

111
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:46,480
the precision to my prior beliefs. This is something he mentioned in the last

112
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:55,760
active inference recording, 53.1. And to end this introduction,

113
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,920
one concept we introduced in our paper, which is central to our discussion, is that of zones

114
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:07,280
of bandwidth surprise. So this is a new concept we introduced to refer to the levels of mismatch

115
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:14,000
between prior beliefs or top-down predictions and sensory information that species can tolerate.

116
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:21,440
So first and foremost, the focus of the ZBS concept is on the observers and their ability

117
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:28,320
to make sense of unobserved innovation. Encoding and subsequent copying of innovation depends

118
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,440
on the degree of disparity or surprise between predictable behaviors, namely,

119
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,640
those typical of the species, and the perceptual incoming information about novel behaviors.

120
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:45,040
If the ZBS is right, it means that the species can give credit to the information received

121
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:51,120
through its senses that challenges the prior beliefs. In short, as species can register and

122
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:56,080
code and potentially reproduce innovative behavior of certain code specifics that

123
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:02,720
deviate markedly from customary prototypical behaviors. The species is highly impressionable

124
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:08,960
if we use the words that Professor Friston used the other day. So if the ZBS is narrow,

125
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:13,920
then a species' ability to change prior beliefs to accommodate new evidence regarding

126
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:21,840
innovative practices of serving code specifics is compromised. I just want to end up and avoid

127
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:26,640
any kind of misunderstanding. I want to make clear that our zone of bandwidth surprises have

128
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:33,680
nothing to do with the zone of Latin solutions by Tenie, albeit we are discussing similar topics.

129
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:41,520
So the zone of Latin solutions that was introduced by Tenie Kai and Tomo Aselo refers to solutions

130
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:47,920
to a problem, for instance, extractive foraging that can be achieved by an individual in isolation

131
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:53,600
during his or her lifetime and hence is not likely to be the product of cumulative culture

132
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:59,120
involving social learning when observed in the wild. And for those readers interested in this

133
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:09,360
concept, they can go to the original paper I'm showing here. And also there is a recent paper

134
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:18,880
by Andrew Whiten, who is Professor in St. Andrews, that discusses this concept and that has replication

135
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:24,720
by other authors. So it might be a good update for those interested also. And with that, I

136
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:33,120
finish this short presentation and we can enter this question. Let me stop sharing the screen. Okay, now.

137
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:43,120
Thank you, Hector. I will bring up the notes again and to Michael, Carl or Dean,

138
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,680
whomever would like to provide a first response, please.

139
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:59,360
Well, I don't really have a great deal more to add. I think

140
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:09,920
Hello. Yes, please continue. What's happened here? You're all good, Michael.

141
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:17,120
We're here, Michael. Hello. Can you hear me? Yes, we hear you continue. Yes, we can. I'm not quite

142
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:24,880
sure what's happened here. We seem to have snakes and ladders up on the screen. As I said, I don't

143
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:31,200
think I can add much more to what Hector has just said. I think it makes a very succinct

144
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:42,720
summary of our paper. And I would like to certainly congratulate Hector for making

145
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:51,520
what seems to me a very original and perceptive observation that it is the observers whom we

146
00:15:51,520 --> 00:16:01,600
have to thank for the copying and therefore for the handing down of technological achievements by

147
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:11,280
early humans. Whereas too often the emphasis has been made on the personal responsible for making

148
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:18,960
a technological innovation. But of course, unless somebody copies that, or at least unless it registers

149
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:24,720
in the mind of somebody else, it is unlikely ever to get copied. And although this seems to be a fairly

150
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:33,360
obvious observation, it seems to have escaped most of those who have published on the matter

151
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:39,600
either too. And I think this is a very original contribution on Hector's part, which deserves

152
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:47,680
to be complimented. And really, that's all I wish to say. I think I'd like to throw this open to

153
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:55,600
other people. And if I can illuminate or elucidate any matters, I'm happy to do so. But I think

154
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:03,280
this is really very much to put it mildly Hector's brainchild. And congratulations.

155
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:11,840
Thanks, Michael. You're very kind, but this is our child. And you know a lot. You have a lot to

156
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:17,280
contribute. So I mean, I can only learn school. But thank you anyway.

157
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,360
Awesome. Carl or Dean?

158
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:27,920
Go ahead, Carl.

159
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:40,160
Right. So I just wanted to reiterate Michael's admiration for both the idea, but also the very

160
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:50,400
fluent and clear articulation of it. It was nice for me to see that presented so succinctly,

161
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:57,680
because the clarity of the idea is really very evident. It struck me there are sort of two

162
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:09,600
themes that we could discuss, which is the emergence of more complicated solutions to

163
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,800
accurately engaging with and modeling our world. I think that was sort of a generic theme in the

164
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:19,040
first part of the presentation. But then very quickly, we moved to this kernel idea, this core

165
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:31,600
idea that the dissemination and the transgenerational propagation that could be read as some kind of

166
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:38,080
cultural niche construction in a sort of evo-devo context depends upon being able to recognize

167
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:46,640
a particular behavior and thereby copy and imitate. I think that was the key thing. And for me,

168
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:56,160
just understanding the mechanics of that from the point of view of belief updating and active

169
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:08,320
inference was, I think, a really useful thing. And as Hector beautifully articulated, the ability

170
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:17,360
to recognize something new and update one's generative model or posterior beliefs depends

171
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:24,000
very sensitively on the confidence or the precision that you've described, the sense of evidence,

172
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,640
in relation to the precision with which you hold your prior belief. And I think that's

173
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:40,000
absolutely crucial. And I sort of highlight that issue because it is exactly the same issue

174
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:46,800
that you will find when applying active inference and the free energy principle to

175
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,880
psychiatry and the different ways in which we can... I can't remember, Hector, what was your

176
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:59,120
word, misfire, in neither a good nor a bad sense, but certainly there are certain psychiatric

177
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:05,120
syndromes that could be regarded as misfiring. And of course, there's a very close association

178
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:12,560
with innovation and creativity and manic depressive psychosis, famed in terms of various

179
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:22,640
historical figures in the arts. And that, I think, again, brings us back to this key notion

180
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:30,880
of getting that balance, the balance of the precision of our prior constructs,

181
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:36,960
what we have accrued through experience-dependent learning, and the precision-afforded evidence

182
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,200
that this is how the world is actually working and how I am actually working, getting that balance

183
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:47,760
right. And that's a really difficult job. And sometimes in computational psychiatry,

184
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:55,040
we try to explain this in terms of a statistician. In order to get the balance right, you have to

185
00:20:55,040 --> 00:21:01,520
be able to estimate these precisions in exactly the same spirit that a statistician, when making

186
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:06,880
an inference doing a t-test, has to estimate not just the difference in the group means,

187
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,920
but also the standard error. And it's often much more difficult to estimate the standard error

188
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:18,960
than it is to estimate the difference in the group means. And that standard error is the

189
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:25,200
inverse precision. It's the weight that you afford, the meaning, the significance of some

190
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:32,080
quantitative difference, say, a prediction error. So you see this theme that there are two parts to

191
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:38,000
inference. The first order part is just the prediction error or the surprise. But then

192
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:44,160
you have to assign how newsworthy is that. You have to actually modulate that

193
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:48,720
with its precision. So you can multiply by the precision or divide by the standard error

194
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:55,200
to get the actual thing that matters that's going to change your mind. And there's a whole

195
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:04,320
literature on different kinds of people in the context of neurodiversity that have an impairment

196
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:09,520
in being able or possibly have an impairment in being able to estimate that precision. And

197
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:16,400
I'm thinking here of the poster child of this kind of formulation, which is autism. And the idea

198
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:25,120
being that there is an early developmental failure to attenuate sensory precision. So they are

199
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:36,160
early and continually during their early development, severe autism, unable to ignore

200
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:43,600
any of their sensations. And as a consequence, everything is surprising. Everything's arousing.

201
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:50,560
Everything is in danger of revising any beliefs very, very quickly. So they're highly impressionable

202
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:57,120
to the extent they can't build deeply coherent models of their lived world or indeed the other

203
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:05,440
artifacts such as mum that constitutes their world. So I'm just wondering whether a species

204
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:14,720
that has the same kind of latitude in terms of either biasing attention or precision

205
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:20,960
to sensory evidence versus accumulated prior beliefs would display the same kind of misfiring.

206
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:26,480
So you can go from one end and autistic species will be overly impressionable.

207
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:31,440
It'll be too evolvable. It will be able to remember anything from generation to generation.

208
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:39,600
The converse is somebody who you can imagine from a psychiatric perspective

209
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:46,880
has committed unduly to very precise prior beliefs about the world works. And you can think of this

210
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:52,960
in terms of compulsive obsessional disorder or perhaps even depression. The world is an awful

211
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:59,040
place. That is true. Therefore, there's no point in going out and challenging the evidence that the

212
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:07,280
world is an awful place. So I'm just going to stay inside and feel isolated and not move or say very

213
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:12,560
much. So that would be an example of who somebody is not very impressionable. In fact,

214
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:18,320
their pathology, their misfiring prevents them from acquiring any evidence to revise those beliefs.

215
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:25,280
So if you imagine a species that had that same kind of second order misfiring,

216
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:32,320
this is not the misfiring of the innovative soul. This is a failure to infer the second

217
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:38,960
order cystics, the reliability, the precision, the variance, the entropy of the content of the

218
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:47,760
things they try to innovate or make sense of. You're left with this notion of a species that

219
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:56,560
just cannot respond to selective pressures for selectability. They can't respond by adjusting

220
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:01,360
their evolvability simply because they're fixed in their way. So for the environmental,

221
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:07,440
economic changes in any fundamental way, they're not going to be able to respond to that.

222
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:18,560
So I think there are many examples of this key. I think it would be called a pathology in the

223
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:26,080
sense that in a volatile environment, you would need to optimize the precision afforded sensory

224
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:31,120
evidence in order to make the best sense and understand and engage with that environment.

225
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:36,880
And if you get that wrong, there will be a pathology. And I think basically Hector's

226
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:46,560
formulation really drills down and really focuses on the actual mechanism of this kind of pathology.

227
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:52,960
It's all about the transcultural spread of generative models and sense making

228
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:59,120
in terms of engaging either with artifacts or indeed with conspecifics.

229
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:08,080
I repeat, it's such an easy thing to get wrong as evinced in psychiatry. There are so many instances

230
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:18,160
of neurodiversity expressed clinically that I think reflects this singular dimension in terms

231
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:24,640
of the ability to get that balance right. I remember we discussed last time again in terms of

232
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:30,160
impressionability and selection for selectability and the like, the same kind of mechanism unfolding

233
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:38,000
in terms of evolutionary mechanics. But at the level that I think we're talking about today

234
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:46,800
in terms of pursuing plans and novel ways of doing things that may or may not be

235
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:56,240
recognized due to a failure or not of being able to suspend the precision of your priorities.

236
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:02,640
I think that was a central theme. I'll just close with an interesting comment that

237
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:08,960
in terms of the kind of misfiring that Hector was implying, basically a novel way of doing things,

238
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:15,360
being the unique province of those kinds of creatures that can plan possibly deeper into the

239
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:21,760
future. There's a really interesting sort of link back to this precision notion

240
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:30,640
in the sense that if you try to simulate the depth of planning of any sentient artifact,

241
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:38,080
then the degree to which they are able to look into the future depends upon the precision

242
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:44,160
of their beliefs about the succession of contingencies. What will happen if this happens

243
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:50,480
and then what will happen if that happens? It's technically the precision of the transitions

244
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:56,480
amongst worldly states of affairs as you roll out into the future. Again, you have to estimate

245
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:04,320
that precision. There's another point at which precision gets into the game, but in this instance,

246
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:12,000
it's not the precision of the sensory evidence, but the prior precision about the ways things

247
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:18,320
unfold and what will happen if I do that. If you have a low precision there, then you don't

248
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,960
hang very far into the future because you lose certainty and confidence very, very quickly

249
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:30,640
after just a few moves. Whereas if you have very precise beliefs about the state transitions and

250
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:37,040
the consequences of various actions or sequential policies, then you can roll out confidently much

251
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:44,320
further into the future and perhaps find that innovative solution. Again, you come back mechanistically

252
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:55,120
to phenotypes that have differing degrees of precision. In this instance, get into the game

253
00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:06,720
in terms of bounding the depth of the planning or the temple horizons that you can entertain

254
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:13,760
when scoring different plans in order to actually select the best action at the moment.

255
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:21,440
For me, that insight is really useful because I can see how one could simulate that quite easily

256
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:29,760
in toy situations. Those are my thoughts inspired by Hector's excellent presentation.

257
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:36,960
Thank you, Carl. Dean, what say you?

258
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:50,240
Well, if it's okay, I'd like to step back for a second. Because we were privileged to be able

259
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:57,360
to look at the two papers almost simultaneously, I know chronologically we've split it up into

260
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:04,080
weeks, but as readers we were able to kind of look at both papers side by each. I kind of want

261
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:10,800
to take a bit of a Hofstetter strange loop, two-sided condition, Mobius. We've got all those

262
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:18,080
representations in a lot of our live stream introductions. So if we were to assume that

263
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:24,480
because Carl pointed out not everybody can accommodate a two things at once perspective,

264
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:31,520
if we can assume that that doesn't overwhelm, my question to the authors is, do they see their

265
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:43,200
own journey as a one paper or artifact morphing into the next, or as we were pulled out and taken

266
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:49,120
up by this relationship between epistemic and pragmatic values when uptaking an active inference

267
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:56,400
perspective? That's part one of the question. Part two is the former is kind of a sequential

268
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:02,960
mechanical technical side of things. The latter is the combinatorial plus meaning entailed and

269
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:12,320
entangled. So more where am I relative? So combined, that's a relative depth of field

270
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:19,840
as setting, as establishing, morphing, we want to call it that. As active inference strategy

271
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:26,560
is applied, how do the authors see or potentially see this perspective combining, meaning the

272
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:33,120
sequential end of the combinatorial affecting, not effecting, but affecting what we believe?

273
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:40,640
Because I'm a big believer that we can't just sort of strip the feelings part of this out. I think

274
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:46,880
that's whether we're talking chimpanzees or whether we're talking the emotions of sliding down a snake,

275
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:52,480
those are part of this thing that we're looking at.

276
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:03,040
I'll just give one short note on that. In the paper, Sophisticated Affective Inference,

277
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:12,560
they simulated counterfactual futures, projections about futures, which are in active inference,

278
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:19,600
action oriented. All futures are analyzed and inferred about with respect to policy selection

279
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:28,640
by the agent. And one of the patterns already apparent in even the simple simulations were that

280
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:37,280
even if a very small fraction of counterfactuals have like death as an outcome or highly negative

281
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:42,880
outcomes, it can increase the variance estimator on possible futures greatly,

282
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:53,680
leading to essentially ruminative behavior and affective anxiety around the legitimately warranted

283
00:32:53,760 --> 00:33:01,760
variance in possible outcomes. So I see a key piece of this puzzle to be entertaining

284
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:08,080
progressively wider time cones of possible futures in a prospective capacity,

285
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:17,040
and entertaining progressively wider time cones in the past of causal mechanisms

286
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:32,400
and somehow negotiating that affect barometer in the moment as the eye of the needle.

287
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:42,080
Hector and Michael, where do you see affect coming into the snakes and ladders to copy

288
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:52,400
or not to copy set? Well, may I make one or two comments? First of all, in addition to

289
00:33:53,040 --> 00:34:00,000
what Professor Fiston has told us about autism and so on, I think it's worth mentioning

290
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:07,200
in the connection of the question that Daniel has just raised to say that there is clearly a

291
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:16,560
difference in the evolution during the life cycle of early humans on the one hand and great apes

292
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:25,200
and probably most human forerunners on the other, the extension of the human life cycle,

293
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,120
the extension beyond childhood, and in particular, as I mentioned last time,

294
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:40,240
the adolescent growth spur to which we have, but which may not have existed in early hormone

295
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:49,520
even one and a half million years ago, I'm sure is relevant to making the evolutionary

296
00:34:50,320 --> 00:35:01,680
step between, let us say, the surprise that perhaps a chimpanzee has if she

297
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:10,160
observes a dead bird and then regards this as counterintuitive because birds ought not

298
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:17,920
to be lying on the ground, throws it up into the air, but this is an individual spontaneous

299
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:25,440
reaction which is not handed on as part of a behavioral repertoire of the species.

300
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:35,360
And on the other hand, when we begin to see the reproduction of, as it were, counterintuitive

301
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:44,640
behavioral sequences such as taking a lot of flakes repetitively by hand from a piece of stone

302
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:53,360
using another stone to produce an almond-shaped hand axe fairly regularly flaked on both sides,

303
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:01,440
something which is not found before Homo appears in the archaeological and paleoantribological

304
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:09,520
record, but which is not something that seems to be a regular part of human behavior. It is almost

305
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:18,720
as if the individual who made that was doing it as a kind of spontaneous thought of what might

306
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:26,880
happen if I was to do this, part of the deep generation of the hierarchically mechanistic

307
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:34,560
mind which Professor Fiston has told us about, a deep generation that, however, may have been

308
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:41,840
a misfiring, it may have been simply a personal spontaneous event which is not easily

309
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:52,000
recognized by others, particularly if their, shall we say to put it mildly, their mental

310
00:36:53,360 --> 00:37:00,720
development is stunted due to the early adulthood and the lack of any adolescence.

311
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:09,200
Adolescence in particular, which and of course the development of the neuronal

312
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:14,800
architecture of the brain which in modern people continues until our mid-20s, if this was not to

313
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:24,160
have occurred, as it does not of course in evening gray tapes, then there would have been perhaps

314
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:32,320
a problem here about the deep generative potential of an individual ever being

315
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:40,400
recognized such that it isn't just what might happen if I was to do this with a piece of stone,

316
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:46,560
but what might happen if I was to copy what that other individual is doing with a piece of stone.

317
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:55,760
And this I think is the stumbling block, this is what has led to the snakes and ladders picture,

318
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:05,920
it is what I think has led to the very slow adaptation of technological, cumulative technological

319
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:13,680
handing down from between generations or between individuals of a generation and between

320
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:21,280
generations and it may well have been the case that it was not until demographical

321
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:32,400
as well of course as paleobiological changes had evolved in the Guinness Homo that there was

322
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:42,640
sufficient intercourse, not merely sexual but social such that these questions continue to be

323
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:50,880
asked ever more frequently and with the appearance of better and ever more fluent communication

324
00:38:51,680 --> 00:39:02,160
would allow what we now regard as human culture specifically human nature which

325
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:12,640
I think has differentiated us ever more from the gray tapes. I just, those are my thoughts on the

326
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:21,600
matter. Thank you Michael, Tari or anyone else please.

327
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:33,360
When I just speak to the question about affect and what Michael has just treated us to,

328
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:46,320
so one way of conceiving of affect and valence and the emotional aspects of

329
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:55,840
choosing different plans or making sense of my own bodily sensations is to think a bit in terms of

330
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:06,000
precision estimation. So one way of carving, one way of a very generic way of thinking about some

331
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:13,280
negatively effectively charged states of mind would be those states of mind in which there is

332
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:22,000
irreducible or unresolvable uncertainty. So you know to put simply to be uncertain about what is

333
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:30,640
going to happen to me or what I should do is to be in a state of angst and that can be linked to

334
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:39,440
notions such as anxiety and you know with some extra nuances other feelings such as you know

335
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:47,600
a low affect and indeed if that is pervasive a low mood or or depression but I think the key

336
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:54,400
thing here and indeed many people have developed a calculus of emotion based upon whether your

337
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:59,920
average level of uncertainty is increasing or decreasing or is high and low and adding these

338
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:05,440
things together to get an ontology of emotional states or a purely sort of inference perspective

339
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:14,480
there's another body of thought and literature which links emotions to the literally gut

340
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:22,240
feelings, interception. So that certain emotional states are just hypotheses about the way that I

341
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:28,960
am feeling now that best explain the myriad of extraceptive, intraceptive sensations. So I think

342
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:37,280
there is a mechanics of affect in certainly intraceptive inference and possibly more generally

343
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:46,080
in terms of active inference. However there is another aspect of things that we

344
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:54,880
the feelings that we might associate when we feel compelled to do things and I'm thinking here

345
00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:02,400
not about the irreducible or irresolvable uncertainty but about uncertainty that can

346
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:09,520
be resolved. I'm thinking here when Hector mentioned Andy Clark's treatment of surprise

347
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:21,840
there is also the truism that we expect to be surprised and technically that lens that can

348
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:30,240
be explained in terms of the imperatives for choosing those actions that will resolve uncertainty

349
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:38,080
about the way the world works. So this is just an expression of novelty. So if we anticipate

350
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:46,640
that we are going to be surprised by some outcome what we are saying is that that outcome is going

351
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:53,360
to be informative and that it will reduce some uncertainty. Technically it has a high expected

352
00:42:53,360 --> 00:43:00,960
information gain. So I'm speaking here as a statistician and using terms that would underlie

353
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:08,960
the Bayesian principles of experimental design that we do these experiments specifically

354
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:14,720
in order to get surprising outcomes that are by definition going to resolve my uncertainty

355
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:21,280
about my different hypotheses. So if we think about the misfires that are innovations

356
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:30,480
these are effectively by definition novel behaviors and there are the fact that people

357
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:41,040
or certain people in certain regions engage in novelty seeking is entirely sensible from

358
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:47,520
the point of view of the free energy principle because novelty seeking just is an expression

359
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:54,160
of curiosity it is just an expression of choosing those outcomes that are going to yield rich

360
00:43:54,160 --> 00:44:01,520
information that has technically a high self-information or an expected information gain.

361
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:10,960
So this is another view of the if you like the effective aspect that we do we are compelled

362
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:17,280
and expect ourselves and will possibly explain ourselves as being excited in a positive way

363
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:23,360
at the opportunity to resolve uncertainty because we see an opportunity to do something novel what

364
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:28,720
is behind that door you know what is inside this present you know what would happen if I did that

365
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:34,640
and that's an entirely natural and by natural I mean something that is easily naturalized under

366
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:41,280
the physics of self-organization of any system that has or entails an implicit generative model

367
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:48,400
the consequences of its own action. So I thought it was a lovely link between that kind of

368
00:44:50,720 --> 00:45:02,320
affect written into the imperative to seek novelty to seek surprises in the future

369
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:10,000
and what Michael was saying about well yes in order to do that you still have you still have

370
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:19,120
you have to suspend your your prior convictions because if you a priori think you know everything

371
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:25,440
there is no novelty there is no imperative for expiration and you just do the same thing time

372
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:32,240
and time again but if you're in a if you can recognize that there is reducible uncertainty

373
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:39,600
and choose those actions that have the greatest expected expected information gain then you

374
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:48,800
will necessarily succumb to novelty seeking behavior and thereby discover those misfire

375
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:58,320
innovations so and it may be that you know there is well the story that Michael was telling was

376
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:04,480
that we are built to be curious creatures for much longer we are built to you know to be able

377
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:13,520
to respond to novelty and to find those innovative novel ways of behaving and you know so that we

378
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:22,080
remain we were we retain that childlike curiosity as part of our epigenetic neurodevelopmental

379
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:29,360
programming for much longer than other species so I I think that matches very nicely with

380
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:35,760
the sort of the basic thesis that Hector was proposing during the presentation it all comes

381
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:44,960
back to getting the precision of your prior beliefs right and suspending very precise

382
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:52,080
prior beliefs in order to explore hypotheses and that exploration just is in terms of engaging

383
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:58,800
in novel innovative behaviors that moves um that you know will resolve your uncertainty

384
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:06,480
so I if that's right it's sort of engender the question why is there an evolutionary pressure

385
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:13,760
for this kind of eternal childhood so I want to ask Michael and Hector

386
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:19,840
because Michael certainly brought in language and cultural niche construction

387
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:27,840
my guess would be that there will be a circular causality between the

388
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:37,840
the cultural eco niche and the phenotypes that are trying to adapt to that cultural eco niche

389
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:44,400
such that they are required or the phenotypes that have the greatest adaptive fitness are those

390
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:51,920
that retain a greater curiosity in the context of the culture in which they find themselves

391
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:58,240
and part of that will be necessary to actually understand the communication and the signs and

392
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:04,160
the semiotics afforded by their conspecifics which could be read just as language so my question is

393
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:12,720
did this innovative uh does innovative tool use does it emerge um um stochastically or um

394
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:22,560
sort you know um at certain points along with communication and language um or um are they

395
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:29,920
or are they not correlated and if they are correlated in terms of you know um you know

396
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:35,920
historically um what are their thinking about the direction of causality does the fact that you

397
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:45,440
um um remain curious and innovative for much longer um lead to language that we can you know

398
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:53,440
engage in novel communicative behaviors or is it that we need to um remain curious and open-minded

399
00:48:53,440 --> 00:49:00,080
in terms of um thinking about or entertaining novel plans and innovative plans simply because we

400
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:06,000
have to make sense of a world that is rich in information because there is language that is

401
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:11,840
that has been culturally inherited or is it both is there is a both top down and bottom up causation

402
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:22,320
so so two questions language tool use and copying and the um the coupling between the

403
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:29,920
sort of evolutionary um phylogetic um sorry the phylogetic on the um the um sort of phenotypic

404
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:37,280
levels when it comes to things like language well um I wonder if I could come in here

405
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:45,840
Daniel is it okay if I address uh calls questions yes in whatever order you like

406
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:56,000
thank you um well in the first place there is a voluminous literature on the relationship between

407
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:04,240
language and the origins of toolmaking and tool use uh really and there's a lot of

408
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:10,960
unresolved argument about whether the two came together very early in human evolution

409
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:15,360
let's say between one million and two million and one and a half million years ago

410
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:24,640
as I originally thought some years ago or whether in fact languages we know it or shall we say

411
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:31,920
fluent communication at least uh only developed much later as I'm coming around to believe now

412
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:37,680
and as Noam Chomsky has said for many many years uh I don't want to get involved in that because

413
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:45,600
really we would need two or three programs and a lot of literature to compare and contrast

414
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:54,400
rather I would query whether we have an eternal childhood

415
00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:00,800
on the contrary I think that physiological childhood

416
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:11,120
is slowed down and when the adolescent growth spurt arises after about the age of let's say

417
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:16,640
nine years old uh at sometimes or perhaps somewhat later at others

418
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:26,720
is when we see a major change uh in behavior which is no longer childish but is neither is it

419
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:33,360
adult um of course we needn't go into that we all know that adolescents can be very impetuous

420
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:41,440
but they can also be extremely anxious and this brings us to the angst that uh Carl has mentioned

421
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:51,440
and which I certainly felt uh as an adolescent uh facing the weekly viva voce examinations in human

422
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:58,160
anatomy in the dissecting room which in those days we all had to undergo uh at least in the United

423
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:04,880
Kingdom uh as I can show uh Carl remembers and which always that put me into a state of extreme

424
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:16,320
nervousness and has given me a lifelong worry about the lack of accuracy uh let alone precision

425
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:24,720
in anatomical description and identification uh and a concern um with the statistical

426
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:33,280
variability in uh uh in human anatomy or aspects of it or anatomy in general necessarily human

427
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:41,280
and its relation to uh uh process in other words to physiology and I feel myself much more

428
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:49,360
despite having lectured in human anatomy much more uh aligned to physiology uh and I spent

429
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:54,320
some time doing your physiological stuff you know many many years ago you know I talked to

430
00:52:54,320 --> 00:53:03,360
him in Göttingen um then uh in the uh classification this has to be that way uh and as we were taught

431
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:08,800
as medical students all was linked back to about the most obvious rather than the most obscure

432
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:15,760
but we have to have the whole range before us and this brings in the whole um the whole problem of

433
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:27,120
do we think in terms of very uh right or wrong concrete uh facts about stuff in general

434
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:35,280
or do we think in terms of the statistical range of variability whether uh this is uh in terms of

435
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:44,720
occurrences uh let's say related to um Poisson type distributions or to uh uh continuous

436
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:51,440
variants which can be let's say related to um Gaussian type distributions and unfortunately it

437
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:57,920
was only much later in life that I discovered that in fact uh modern statistics allows these two

438
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:03,920
approaches to be uh compared and contrasted in a uniform manner I didn't know that um

439
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:14,000
50 years ago alas uh which shows my my my my ignorance still uh I would come back to the

440
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:23,200
whole business of the growth um curve of of humans that this clearly has altered when we

441
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:31,120
look at chimpanzees and other great apes basically they don't have much of anything approaching

442
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:37,840
our adolescents they don't have this slowing down of growth and then a recuperation of the

443
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:46,800
velocity of growth combined with uh most important not merely anatomical and physiological changes

444
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:59,520
but also uh those of the mind uh the ability to uh innovate the ability to have lateral thinking

445
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:08,880
or the ability um which I have noticed in some um uh young people I've met with an

446
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:16,400
asperger syndrome to be able to concentrate in much great in great detail on particular matters

447
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:23,120
which are extraordinarily arcane such as Sanskrit literature uh in uh people that are not of a

448
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:32,800
South Asian heritage uh whereas uh in dealing with uh other people uh their other colleagues uh

449
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:44,160
they appear to be uh shall we say gauche uh and this is of course well known however and indicates the

450
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:55,040
range of variability but it is the change which we all undergo uh in not merely physical but also

451
00:55:55,840 --> 00:56:02,560
intellectual uh ability and inquisitiveness uh which could get us into trouble uh when we are

452
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:13,840
in our adolescence and as young men and women uh given the uh continual and continuous changes in our

453
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:22,720
urinal architecture at least until our mid-20s these days which I think distinguishes and has

454
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:29,920
distinguished the evolution of uh homo sapiens well homo in general and homo sapiens in particular

455
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:38,080
but I wouldn't rule out Neanderthals or even homo erectus and which I think has been cumulative

456
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:43,360
and undoubtedly although we have no idea undoubtedly

457
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:55,920
enhanced by uh increased excuse me and ever ever more complicated uh communication

458
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:03,600
during the the past probably half a million and certainly quarter of a million years

459
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:12,880
this curiosity what would happen if we did this what would happen if we did that um but

460
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:24,560
even so things are not rapidly uh grasped and we see that in different parts of the world

461
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:28,880
particularly in modern populations even that have been long separated from each other

462
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:36,560
not everything is developed at the same rate a couple of well-known examples

463
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:45,360
are for example uh the wheel which first appears probably on the Eurasian steps about 5000 years

464
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:52,480
ago and was used for traction and then appears quite independently in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica

465
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:59,200
um about 2000 years ago and was not used even that would have been very useful

466
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:04,080
but even anything as simple as a wheelbarrow but simply to move around in your images

467
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:11,520
whether they were dolls or toys or gods with no idea and another one taken from the same

468
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:18,720
two areas of the world uh is the metallurgy of copper which appears about well perhaps over

469
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:26,400
6000 years ago in Eurasia and possibly 2000 years ago independently in the new world

470
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:37,520
and yet other things happen too for example in Australia we find modern people were making

471
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:44,880
hand axes when these had long ceased to be made by anybody outside your uh Australia

472
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:52,080
some of them may even be um only a few thousand years old so this

473
00:58:55,120 --> 00:59:02,160
appearance and disappearance and reappearance is something which has not gone away and must

474
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:13,920
be related somehow to our ability to to this deep generation of our inquisitiveness our curiosity

475
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:22,880
and indeed our ability um to not to see the most obvious thing around us the desire to see

476
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:33,840
only one simple solution uh this uh which so irritated me when my teachers in the

477
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:39,760
in has a department when I was a medical student believed that there was only one

478
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:49,600
right answer asked how many heads this muscle had or which um how many how many

479
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:53,680
vertebrae there were and this and all that part of the vertebral column

480
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:59,680
that alone in the skull and we know how very variable these matters can be so

481
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:08,320
there is this tension between the desire for things to be seen in one light only

482
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:18,800
in a one-dimensional way and our natural inquisitiveness this deep deeply generated

483
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:27,760
desire to say what would happen if it was like this how is it how has it come to be like that

484
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:35,760
why is everything different and not the same I can't put it any other way with that I've said

485
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:40,880
of course you know thank you Michael Dean

486
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:50,880
thanks Daniel um so again this is for the authors this this has been really helpful to me

487
01:00:50,880 --> 01:01:00,320
as observers because that's that's highlighted um very clearly in the papers I see both papers um

488
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:04,880
speaking to something that I would describe as condition set meaning

489
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:13,360
in the papers examples limit the game to the game metaphor at least to this type where there's

490
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:21,680
a limited number of tiles and a and a clear continuation until a conclusion or recognize

491
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:29,920
the limit of the species to not cracking so there there's a there's a real clear idea and Michael's

492
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:38,080
and Hector both spoken to so what was the what was the growth limit of the of the

493
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:44,480
brain's capacity etc well I'm curious about and I and I don't know if there's a Michael or Hector

494
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:53,520
have a a real clear answer to this but I'm wondering what and when was the

495
01:01:53,760 --> 01:02:03,920
the was maybe the range of time that we see the unlocking or or or sort of combinatorial

496
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:11,920
explosion or not but what I guess what I'm asking is is is there a move that we can

497
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:18,720
clearly see as being something that differentiates playing which we know happens in a lot of species

498
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:24,880
and gaming because as I said at the end of 53.1 I wondered if it was going to be game on

499
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:31,440
and so I'm I'm curious what the authors think about that is there a difference between playing

500
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:41,440
and gaming meaning that there's now an actual introduction of strategy in this um so maybe

501
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:48,400
another way of asking it is there a moment when you guys can point to it and say this was kind of

502
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:58,400
when we saw a a reducing or maybe a relaxing of a of a limit forward world

503
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:08,880
I wonder whether in fact this difference is really quite as great as Dean suggests

504
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:19,760
and whether it may be have something to do with the ability in working memory and other aspects

505
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:36,080
of memory in dealing with or in developing a logical mathematical ability to plan or in planning

506
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:46,800
and in communicating disability such that the planning is no longer at an on an individual

507
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:56,480
level but is participatory and therefore again in other words and perhaps Hector can answer

508
01:03:56,480 --> 01:04:06,080
this question but I would suggest that this developed slowly gradually and by no means

509
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:15,280
in a continual let alone a continuous manner in Homo but not in earlier in a way it did not in

510
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:23,200
earlier and other hominid species do we see and this I would ask Hector do we really see

511
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:31,840
um let's just say uh well chimpanzees or other great apes developing the kind of

512
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:37,680
logical math ability to make very very simple combinatorial

513
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:51,600
associations between objects or behavioral activities and developing this into a communal game

514
01:04:53,200 --> 01:05:00,480
which involves other individuals in the group because as Hector has remarked on various occasions

515
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:08,720
and informed me when we see things like nut fat in small groups of chimpanzees by no means

516
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:19,040
is copied by all of them let alone copied or emulated by all of them but and by no means

517
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:26,480
even when it is with faithful accuracy and precision in the manual operations that are

518
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:36,080
required so that I would ask Hector do we see these associations being transformed into games

519
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:42,560
okay that's a tricky question um

520
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:51,200
I mean what we know with chimpanzees is that they have promised to do these second organ

521
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:59,040
relationships which is like hierarchical um ordering of for instance if I have a set of

522
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:06,400
objects I can classify them attending to the color for instance chimps could do that okay if

523
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:12,560
only color is involved but I can classify them by color and shape so this is another order of

524
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:20,480
of hierarchy so I can pick things that are square and red and put them together so this ability to

525
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:29,520
abstract um a kind of ordering category so that I have relations of relations like in

526
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:37,600
analogical reasoning when I I can focus on one dimension or in another simultaneously so I can

527
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:42,720
shift my focus from one dimension to another in order to classify things this I think it's

528
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:50,400
quite human like for instance the Wisconsin card sorting test so I can shift from one dimension

529
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:56,720
to another to classify objects or cards and this is something that chimps would have more

530
01:06:56,720 --> 01:07:03,520
problems to do so they might classify in a first order categories like I put things that have a

531
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:10,000
same color they could learn to do that that wouldn't be a big problem but I guess they have to use

532
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:15,760
two dimensions together to classify objects that we have more problems because this involves

533
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:21,840
considering more one that more than one dimension simultaneously I'm not sure I'm making sense here

534
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:30,720
this is the the Jonas Langer work that he did with with kids and that's a remarkable work that

535
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:37,680
Jonas Langer did and then there were these people in Rome I think it was Poti at the lab of

536
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:46,960
um Biopark and Rome that replicated that with um with chimpanzees uh I think it was a spinosci

537
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:52,640
who replicated it and found that chimpanzees were more compromised in order to have this kind of

538
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:59,920
classificatory relations of relations so and I think that's a very very remarkable ability that

539
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:05,120
that uh that we develop so I don't know if I answered your question Michael

540
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:20,960
perhaps that comparison of two dimensions color and shape and then the snakes and

541
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:32,880
ladders overlay that lets us take the hypotenuse is that abductive jump enabled developmentally

542
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:38,160
and neuro epigenetically by all of these different features which happen over much slower

543
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:46,880
timescales especially considering the actual millisecond timescale associated with recognition

544
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:54,400
those other changes are so much slower but the ability to move diagonally on the grid

545
01:08:54,800 --> 01:09:01,760
through the rows and the columns and turn that into movement on a manifold

546
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:10,960
is the ability looked at from the either row or column perspective to move in both at once

547
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:20,000
but by condensing those two dimensions into one there can be new kinds of cognitive movements

548
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:31,280
and then applying that cognitivist lens also evolutionary transitions even without the complex

549
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:41,600
cumulative feedback with the eco-cultural niche merely in the um abductive moment

550
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:49,840
and just one other piece I wanted to return to is that every variable can have a precision

551
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:56,240
estimator or not in the generative models and active inference every variable can be fixed

552
01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:02,880
and so the model can just be persistently surprised with no updating or one can have any

553
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:10,320
kind of prior or hyper prior and so on and that enables learning and that's what enables not just

554
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:17,360
estimation of the mean or the center of gravity the expectation of but also the variance the whole

555
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:28,320
distribution and then it's um by applying that kind of precision on everything view which as

556
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:35,040
Michael brought up is exactly what modern statistics does you can't do

557
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,760
inference with a t-test unless you have the mean and the variance

558
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:45,520
we won't go into any more details on the statistics but every variable has the

559
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:51,280
center of gravity mean estimator and the variance estimator and so we talked about precision on

560
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:56,960
sensory information the mapping between observations and hidden state estimates

561
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:02,880
and then also there's this action oriented precision on how things will unfold

562
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:10,880
and you might be able to update your precision on sensory evidence by seeing something different

563
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:22,880
but updating your precision on how things will unfold is oriented around taking actions

564
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:35,120
and

565
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:45,840
Daniel you must have some questions I can't be the only one floating questions and having my

566
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:48,240
zone of bound and surprise of being expanded here

567
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:58,400
I I have um questions I can ask you a question or Michael or Hector or Carl please feel free

568
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:06,960
if you're only I would like to pick up with something that professor please don't mention

569
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:14,640
before and that was kind of it was intriguing because it is true that some great artists like

570
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:22,640
Van Gogh and others were very creative and also I don't know if it's appropriate to say

571
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:27,200
that they were in the verge of psychosis I don't know if it's appropriate because I

572
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:36,960
don't have any statistics but I'm thinking if being innovative is this again is misfiring so I

573
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:44,720
would like to separate two things one is how innovative you are and I'm thinking in the

574
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:50,640
economy if you are well adapted to an environment it's not a good idea that you try different

575
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:56,080
things all the time because imagine that you have some place where there are nice berries

576
01:12:56,080 --> 01:13:01,760
you have discovered a safe path to that place and if you keep to that path you go to the berries

577
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:07,600
you get there you feed so that's good for you imagine you want to try something new so you

578
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:14,240
are very innovative and one day you decide to try another path to the berries a shortcut so you have

579
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:20,160
one risk that you can face new dangers because this path is new you don't know what is waiting for

580
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:26,000
you there the other is you face it that you can get lost and then you could spend the energy you

581
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:33,280
need to survive so in a way I don't think that being innovative is good in itself but we have

582
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:39,760
the risk if we are too conservative that the environment changes and if the environment changes

583
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:45,760
significantly we are not well adapted because we don't have alternative behaviors that are

584
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:52,720
adaptive to the new environment so I guess with this happens like psychological traits

585
01:13:52,720 --> 01:14:00,000
nobody has extremes so we don't have people with extreme psychological personalities I mean

586
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:06,160
we have pathologies but the selection has favored kind of intermediate levels so I guess

587
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:11,280
and Professor Friston can correct me on this he knows more about psychopathology

588
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:16,880
but I guess it happens with innovation that we need some kind of balance and

589
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:25,520
what this is doing for me is how humans escape that balance in terms of how they

590
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:33,520
manage to be creative and innovative at times because we are very good we repeat many routines

591
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:41,040
so but still we can be very creative and we have selected so we have been successful in

592
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:48,000
up to our recognition and I'm just thinking in this counterfactual idea so I think this

593
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:53,520
might have played a major role the ability to have counterfactuals because perhaps

594
01:14:54,320 --> 01:15:01,520
instead of risking my life every time I innovate I can rehearse what will happen and as Professor

595
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:07,680
Friston mentioned before if I have a good precision I can imagine things that will unfold

596
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:17,680
if the genetic model is very deep I can think ahead many steps and see how I will fare in the

597
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:23,120
future so I can kind of rehearse things in my head before I put them into practice in the real

598
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:32,320
world and this might help me to be innovative but with a kind of bounded risk or controlled risk

599
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:35,760
I don't know if this makes sense but I think it must be some kind of balance between

600
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:40,800
if I can rehearse things in my head I'm very good and predicting things that will

601
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:52,400
evolve or unfold many steps ahead I can see how I will fare and then I can risk to be

602
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:57,840
innovative I don't know I mean I'm very I'm being very speculative here okay so I just want to

603
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:00,480
make clear that I'm being very speculative

604
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:12,960
please Cara yeah no I'd like to speak to that yeah I don't yes you may be speculating but I think

605
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:19,280
those those observations are very very little and very and very useful I mean you've brought a

606
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:25,120
number of fundamental issues to the table first of all the importance of being able to plan

607
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:30,960
to have a generative model of the consequences of actions is not the gift of all species and

608
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:36,880
and in some instances in your words when the environment doesn't change you that would be

609
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:42,480
an undue complexity cost to carry around a brain with a generative model of the consequences of

610
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:47,440
my actions if I don't need it if I was a virus or an insect I wouldn't I wouldn't need that it would

611
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:56,800
be it would be very inefficient and so that sort of lens brings you to a picture that our world

612
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:07,040
is sufficiently complex and changing at pace the committing to very simple underly expressive

613
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:12,640
generative models is not an option and one really important way of making the more expressive is to

614
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:17,520
increase that temporal horizon or temporal depth so that we can you know in accord with things like

615
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:24,400
simulation theory roll out into the future and and now become the kind of phenotypes that can

616
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:30,960
select among a number of plausible policies and you know I think that would be one bright line

617
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:35,840
between lots of you know different genres and different species you know that could be just

618
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:43,520
drawn on a dimension which is just the depth of planning that my generative model will support

619
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:51,920
and we've talked previously about that being constrained by the precision afforded in a given

620
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:58,400
context my beliefs about how I would roll out into the future so I think that's just you know

621
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:04,000
from the from my perspective at least that's a really important observation that the depth of

622
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:09,520
planning is a very important functional characteristic of the generative models

623
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:16,960
that are implicit in phenotypic behavior and possibly in terms of what what kinds of models

624
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:23,520
are subject to selective pressure at an evolutionary or indeed at you know an eva diva at an eva diva

625
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:32,240
level and the other the other I think key insight that you bring to the table here

626
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:42,240
relates to what affords the right balance between novelty seeking exploratory behavior

627
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:52,480
and the risks that that would entail and I think you know that from a purely sort of mathematical

628
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:59,120
point of view is a really important observation just to sort of join the dots with other ways

629
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:06,240
of understanding how the universe works that particular question is very

630
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:12,080
usefully framed in terms of constraints so the free energy principle that from which active

631
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:20,640
inference inherits is one way of or is dual to something called the maximum entropy principle

632
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:29,040
under constraints so this was brought to physics in the 20th century by a foundational thinker

633
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:35,520
et james who basically rewrote physics in terms of probability theory and said that basically

634
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:45,440
everything of interest at least or physically conforms to a constrained maximum entropy principle

635
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:51,120
so that actually is just an expression or form

636
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:58,080
for 10s the free energy principle in the sense that the constraints

637
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:05,120
in from the point of view of free energy principle are just what is brought to the table by a

638
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:13,120
generative model and the entropy pertains to the entropy of belief so you've got this

639
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:21,760
this dialectic simply at the level of the physics of measurement and inference

640
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:27,200
which means that I'm always trying to explain any measurement

641
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:34,960
in such that my predictions are as accurate as possible but at the same time

642
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:42,000
leaving having the maximum of the attitude so that I don't over commit in accord with

643
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:47,280
Occam's principle so mathematically what that means is the entropy of my beliefs has to be as

644
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:54,720
big as possible provided I provide provided I have an accurate given the constraint that my

645
01:20:54,720 --> 01:21:00,480
account on my measurement has to be an accurate measurement so that that may sound if you like

646
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:07,280
completely unconnected to whether I choose to wander away from the very path and but in fact

647
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:13,920
exactly the same maths applies to these quantities either the constrained entropy

648
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:22,080
or the variational free energy in the future and what happens is you get exactly the same dialectic

649
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:29,600
you have two pressures on one hand to comply with Occam's principle or Occam's razor

650
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:31,200
and on the other hand to

651
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:43,840
to keep all your options open which in a sense is exactly do I comply with the constraints

652
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:50,080
that I know I'm going to get my barriers and I'm not going to be eating my myself by a predator

653
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:56,560
or do I keep my options open and try that other path so this this so dialectic is just baited

654
01:21:56,560 --> 01:22:03,680
into the physics of any self-organizing system and practically you know it emerges in a number

655
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:11,600
of ways one way of writing down the free energy or the constrained entropy from James's point of

656
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:19,360
view expected given a particular policy do I go down this path or that path is in terms of ambiguity

657
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:25,680
and risk to you're using exactly your words you know so the risk is just the relative entropy on

658
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:31,920
the divergence or discrepancy between what I think will happen and what I expect to happen to me

659
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:37,200
so I expect not to be eaten and that's the key constraint at hand here there's not about rewards

660
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:42,960
anymore we're throwing away the notion of rewards and we're now replacing it with a multi-dimensional

661
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:49,040
construct which is all the constraints in the ways of being like having a certain temperature or not

662
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:54,240
being very cold or very hot not being eaten not being dead just keeping within my characteristic

663
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:59,920
states so you write down those characteristics states in terms of constraints and those constraints

664
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:06,800
basically preclude certain states of being and then I just compare well what will my states be

665
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:16,400
if I do this and how far away from how far away is that anticipation from my prior constraints

666
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:22,000
and that literally is called risk it's the KL divergence between your policy dependent

667
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:26,960
predictive posterior and your prior preferences that have the constraints

668
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:34,160
the other thing is the ambiguity and that simply reduces to making sure that you make moves in a

669
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:47,200
way that underwrites an unambiguous precise mapping between what you see and what caused your

670
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:53,040
sensation so you avoid dark rooms basically you avoid the dark you avoid dark alleys you don't go

671
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:58,800
where you can't see what's happening so that's the ambiguity so together the expected free

672
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:07,680
energy is equal to risk plus ambiguity and when read like that then the balance between

673
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:14,240
the risk and the ambiguity or another way of carving this up is in terms of expected information

674
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:22,960
gain and expected cost or its complement expected value where the value is just how to what degree

675
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:35,040
am I complying with my constraints is enables you to to now write down the balance that resolves

676
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:40,960
to a certain extent dissolves that dialectic by the precision of your prior preferences your

677
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:49,360
constraints so if you're the kind of creature or child or insect that has very precise beliefs

678
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:55,920
about the kinds of outcomes I expect to anticipate and I may have very precise beliefs about my body

679
01:24:55,920 --> 01:25:01,760
temperature for example but I may have very less precise beliefs about where I am in terms of latitude

680
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:07,440
I could be in Alabama I could be in Newcastle London I can still be me but I can't be minus

681
01:25:08,160 --> 01:25:12,960
your minus two degrees centigrade and still be me so some constraints are very precisely

682
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:19,040
specified and other constraints are less precisely specified so the risk is you know

683
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:29,840
is determined by the precision of your prior beliefs about your characteristic states the

684
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:34,400
precision of the constraints you bring to the table as a phenotype and some people will be innate

685
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:41,280
and completely sub-personal it's wired into your home ostensis and some will be learnable some may

686
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:47,440
even be sort of oppositional you know we can talk about them but whatever they have to be that

687
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:52,720
because they define basically what kind of thing you think you are and how you act accordingly

688
01:25:52,720 --> 01:26:00,400
so the balance between the you know whether to go down another path as opposed to the berry path

689
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:07,280
is going to depend upon this particular creature of phenotype and specifically the precision of

690
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:16,880
their prior preferences in terms of what outcomes they would a priori entertain and if they have very

691
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:24,240
very precise preferences of not being eaten and there's even a marginal small probability of being

692
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:30,080
eaten if they stray from the current path then they won't explore if on the other hand they

693
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:39,040
have a slightly more liberal expectation about being about the encounters with the predator for

694
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:48,320
example and then there will be more there will be more likely to engage in novelty seeking and

695
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:55,680
exploratory behavior so you know perhaps put this even more simply you know that this is the

696
01:26:55,760 --> 01:27:02,640
exploration exploitation dilemma written in terms of the physics of self-organization under

697
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:11,120
planning and you know and it all reduces again to precision and in this instance it's the precision

698
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:19,040
of the constraints that are articulated as the your prior preferences your characteristic states

699
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:26,880
your the kinds of states that you know you are you believe characterize you that if you stray from

700
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:34,800
you cease to be you cease to exist basically so I thought I was I thought you know that's I don't

701
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:40,320
think what you said was speculation I think they're all fundamentals of behavior and actually

702
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:48,160
um from an ecological perspective you know they speak to the heart of the of choice behavior

703
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:55,760
and you know why we do the things we do and why it is always in the background the game

704
01:27:55,760 --> 01:28:04,000
of saying do I explore or do I play it safe awesome thank you Carl Dean

705
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:09,200
I think you'd muted Daniel oh thank you thank you Carl go ahead Dean

706
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:14,000
I just like to run with what Carl was saying

707
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:20,240
this is mostly for Hector and Michael um

708
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:28,720
here's a here's a here's a case in point all the collective wisdom on the side of a volcano

709
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:36,000
can suddenly be arrested and yet there is still a Pompeii today I wonder what you gentlemen think

710
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:40,320
that says about certain species zone of founded surprise

711
01:28:40,720 --> 01:29:02,720
Dean does this refer to the material the fixed materiality alone of the ruins of Pompeii

712
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:07,680
of which no more will ever exist in the

713
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:14,800
archaeological context being able to be unpacked into this collective wisdom

714
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:22,000
I'm just curious because we are talking about regular irregularities and regular irregularities

715
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:30,880
these these seismic events occur in the timeline and I'm just curious what we think then as we

716
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:38,000
reflect on that and still adopt that kind of risk mindset as I said I just want to run with what

717
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:45,920
Carl was was suggesting and I don't know that I don't know that there's an equivalent I don't

718
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:55,120
know if I if I if chimpanzees would do what humans have done like see the evidence and still

719
01:29:55,760 --> 01:30:03,760
you know park themselves right in the path of of danger I'm just curious what they think about that

720
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:07,360
in terms of the timeline aspect of this

721
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:22,000
Hector or Michael go ahead

722
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:26,000
I don't think you're muted now Hector

723
01:30:30,160 --> 01:30:31,200
sorry my microsoft

724
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:39,040
so it's a kind of difficult question Dean I'm not sure if I understood correctly

725
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:47,360
but as you're referring to the zone of founded surprise and linking what what Professor Christon

726
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:54,800
said before if I'm to take any road which is I don't know what awaits for me there okay

727
01:30:55,920 --> 01:31:05,120
but if I'm very good at making guesses or inferring what might happen based on information I have

728
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:13,360
gathered before so I'm good at anticipating what might unfold okay because I have this complex

729
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:18,000
machinery let's call it working memory which is a construct I have a powerful working memories

730
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:24,320
for I have entertained many possibilities and there is something that kind of

731
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:35,040
ring bell when Professor Christon was talking of precision which is the concept of metacognition

732
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:45,360
so metacognition refers to thinking about my own thinking right so I and you have to clear

733
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:55,920
to clear aspects one is how sure am I about my knowledge for instance I'm sure I know

734
01:31:57,280 --> 01:32:03,440
something even when I cannot remember this is the tip of the tongue effect so I can be

735
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:10,480
or I can give you an answer and be 100% sure this answer is correct I can be 80% sure 50%

736
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:18,080
sure so I can evaluate how much sure I am about something okay so this I think it looks a bit

737
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:25,680
like precision so if I make some expect plans and I think one might unfold I can be very sure

738
01:32:25,680 --> 01:32:31,520
this will happen or not and this probably has to do with my metacognition so how sure I am

739
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:36,320
about what will happen and that might help me to decide whether I go or not

740
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:47,920
and coming back to your son of under surprise I'm not sure if I'm digressing but perhaps I can

741
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:56,880
preempt the surprise if I have a good precision or good metacognition so if I'm sure that I can

742
01:32:56,880 --> 01:33:04,480
rehearse things in my head and see how they will unfold they won't be that surprising later

743
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:11,840
so I'm just speculating perhaps this ability to have counterfactuals to have this kind of

744
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:20,240
rehearsing in my head and this depth of generative models can be empty surprise and here I'm

745
01:33:20,240 --> 01:33:26,400
speculating clearly so I don't know if I answer your question about Pompeii because I'm not sure

746
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:34,400
they understood but just bring some some ideas that might be useful but again they are speculative

747
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:45,840
it'd be nice just to link that notion of metacognition and having beliefs about beliefs

748
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:51,440
you know the precision of a belief about the likelihood of being eaten by a predator

749
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:58,800
I think that's what Daniel was speaking to before when he was talking about the hierarchical depth

750
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:06,080
of models and their increasing complexification one really important way of making a model more

751
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:12,560
expressive and context sensitive is to induce a hierarchy of exactly the sort that Hector was

752
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:18,960
talking about in terms of this metacognitive aspect but not just content but crucially again

753
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:28,320
coming back to the confidence and the precision I think that's a really central concept and I

754
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:40,000
was just thinking you know if you had to commit to what kinds of epigenetically specified constraints

755
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:48,560
you would associate with the genome what in what space would they live

756
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:54,880
and my guess is that most of it is about the constraints and within that it's going to be

757
01:34:54,880 --> 01:35:02,800
the constraints on the precisions that there are certain sort of innate ranges of outcomes that I

758
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:11,280
will entertain and in in principle at least you can actually just write down an entire

759
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:18,640
generative model in terms of constraints and in terms of precisions in the sense that if the

760
01:35:18,640 --> 01:35:26,080
generative model is universally expressive and everything goes then you can sort of carve out

761
01:35:26,080 --> 01:35:37,040
an apt structural form for that generative model despite shrinking some of or 99.9% of this overly

762
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:45,360
expressive generative model to zero with very very precise constraints so well perhaps I'll

763
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:54,560
turn this into a question if you were trying to simulate artificial life in its most generic sense

764
01:35:54,560 --> 01:36:00,480
if you're trying to simulate tool use for example the emergence of tool use in a synthetic

765
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:09,440
population and you had to actually write down what could be asked via genetically or epigenetically

766
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:14,240
to each subsequent generation what what kinds of things would you specify

767
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:30,080
that's kind of my question in the same in the same sense how do we

768
01:36:32,240 --> 01:36:37,520
where where do we draw those arbitrary lines I mean it's this it's the thing that comes up again

769
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:44,960
and again as we continue to sort of see the next the next sedimentary layer of papers discussing

770
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:52,800
this right but the but the fact that it can be moving and the fact that it it isn't there is

771
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:58,000
a rate constant that you mentioned in the last live stream that has to be

772
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:06,560
working functioning and effective and then there's still this question of so

773
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:15,760
so what is our our but what are we attending to and what are we still available to all at once

774
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:24,160
and how do we organize that in a way that it most closely as you say precisely if that that's

775
01:37:24,160 --> 01:37:33,120
the best way to describing it what's really going on and that that's that that seems to me at least

776
01:37:33,120 --> 01:37:44,880
to be a moving target just one quick speculative mapping as well first the um instead of just

777
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:53,600
stacking bricks with content on content on content intercalating layers of content estimation

778
01:37:53,600 --> 01:38:00,080
with metacognitive estimation is what allows the extendability of the multi-layer predictive

779
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:06,880
processing type architectures it's actually like the back and forth or the interplay between

780
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:15,200
the content estimators and the variance estimators that allows that model to

781
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:22,720
not just be described in terms of its center of gravity but also in terms of its full distribution

782
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:29,600
and then to Carl's question about what is being passed down genetically and epigenetically

783
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:36,560
and thinking about those terms even generically like in the context of perhaps source code

784
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:44,240
and a configuration file or some other mapping of like what is inscribed from a classical information

785
01:38:44,240 --> 01:38:53,200
genetic perspective and then what is contextually and more rapidly transmitted there's an interesting

786
01:38:53,200 --> 01:39:00,800
angle I could see it this way or potentially the opposite but there's a shorter term epigenetic

787
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:12,880
firing rate and then a slower updating of neuromodulatory like genetic possibilities

788
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:20,480
kind of opening and closing valves over a slower timescale and then of course these are nested

789
01:39:20,480 --> 01:39:25,920
within another one so what is what is neuromodulatory this can also itself be a firing rate in other

790
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:35,440
ways but just focusing on this direction the inscribed constraints are like the width of the

791
01:39:35,440 --> 01:39:44,000
aperture and then the actual flow of the photons through the lens is an instantaneous firing rate

792
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:52,880
that's happening way faster than the aperture can be dilated or not and so merely the fact that there

793
01:39:52,880 --> 01:40:00,400
are multiple concurrent timescales and the associated interplay of their rate constants

794
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:11,040
tells us a lot about this kind of learning architecture what we do without understanding

795
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:20,320
is the action question and related to our preferences and precision however it seems

796
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:31,120
pretty key that to alternate estimates about content with metacognitive type estimates

797
01:40:31,120 --> 01:40:39,680
and to package that set of two belief distributions mean and variance to package those also as one

798
01:40:40,480 --> 01:40:44,320
so it can be handled as a composite one

799
01:40:54,480 --> 01:41:01,680
and just to point out that learning rates are the manifestation of that second order

800
01:41:01,680 --> 01:41:10,800
specification that precision so they are the same thing at every timescale

801
01:41:11,680 --> 01:41:19,200
so you could articulate the developmental stages for example the

802
01:41:19,360 --> 01:41:29,440
rejuvenation but certainly the changes say in late adolescent

803
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:38,480
as a programmed learning rate or learnability that can be read at some level as a precision

804
01:41:38,480 --> 01:41:43,920
because the precision is just the rate constants that link the state to the rate of change of the

805
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:50,960
state and that basically is just a learning rate at many many different levels so I think it was a

806
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:57,760
sort of uniform way of putting together these different notions some useful notions here

807
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:08,320
from machine learning are sort of the notion of learning to infer you know so I was just

808
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:12,880
thinking about my an answer to my own question and clearly you can't write down a generative model

809
01:42:12,880 --> 01:42:18,560
that's going to be able to get up and go to school in the morning all you can do is to

810
01:42:19,680 --> 01:42:28,080
create a self-organizing blob that has exactly the right learning rates so that it is has exactly

811
01:42:28,080 --> 01:42:32,960
the right learnability so that it can acquire a generative model and learn through experience

812
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:39,680
dependent plasticity that model of its little lived world of course that little lived world

813
01:42:39,680 --> 01:42:46,960
has been constructed by other grown-up babies so you know we get back to this circular

814
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:53,120
causality that evolution is trying to provide you with the right ability learning rates,

815
01:42:53,120 --> 01:43:00,880
precisions and structural constraints on your generative model but your generative models

816
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:04,560
from the evolutionist point of view are actually creating the environment that has to be learned

817
01:43:05,200 --> 01:43:10,160
so there's to my mind isn't there's you know a very beautiful circular causality here

818
01:43:10,720 --> 01:43:17,200
that you know as fast as you're learning you're actually creating new worlds in which to learn

819
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:22,160
you know I guess we're seeing that at the moment with the advances in technology and the like

820
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:30,000
which brings me back to my question about the sort of the top-down versus bottom-up causation

821
01:43:30,640 --> 01:43:37,360
about you know what is a good model of this world what is a good phenotype?

822
01:43:37,360 --> 01:43:59,920
in our final 15 minutes or so here how do we move beyond the 53.2 either to the authors

823
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:11,280
their directions and excitements about the work or anyone's exhortations or

824
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:26,480
raising of possibilities for other ways it can be developed

825
01:44:30,880 --> 01:44:39,280
I wonder if it's worth bearing in mind that

826
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:49,600
increasing technological not necessarily complexity but at least variability

827
01:44:49,920 --> 01:45:00,560
may well have permitted a reduction in selection pressure on the

828
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:12,880
phenotype and evidently affecting both the genotype and epigenetic

829
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:22,400
variability I see this because I would like to draw attention to the the graph which I

830
01:45:23,120 --> 01:45:30,080
presented last week which was taken from Professor Philip Tabars's work on early humans

831
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:39,280
showing an increasing range of variation in the cranial capacity of

832
01:45:40,080 --> 01:45:49,200
bipedal hominids from the osteopathy signs through to homo sapiens suggesting a reduction

833
01:45:51,040 --> 01:46:00,720
in selection pressure for particular well for the size of the brain basically

834
01:46:01,120 --> 01:46:13,600
I find it hard not to relate this to the advantages that slowly accrued to

835
01:46:17,280 --> 01:46:24,320
tool use and thereby of course the variability and variation of tool making

836
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:33,360
thereby reducing the risk or some of the risks existential risks

837
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:47,120
that otherwise plague or have plagued other hominins whether extant whether the ancestors

838
01:46:47,120 --> 01:46:56,800
of extant great apes or indeed the earlier forms of bipedal hominin and osteopathy signs

839
01:46:56,800 --> 01:47:07,040
palanthropus canianthopus etc well who knows but it's perhaps

840
01:47:07,120 --> 01:47:19,280
um not totally irrelevant that this variability has grown over the past couple of million years

841
01:47:19,840 --> 01:47:23,680
and is now very wide as I mentioned last week

842
01:47:23,680 --> 01:47:36,080
this I think is in contradiction to the the way in which

843
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:47,040
selection pressures have been highly discriminatory in for example producing let's say the wide range

844
01:47:47,040 --> 01:47:52,400
of Darwin's famous Galapagos finches yeah just to give a well-known example

845
01:47:57,280 --> 01:48:07,280
thank you Carl can I ask um coming back to this theme of um selection for selectability

846
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:18,400
um and the notion of precision or learning rates cast in terms of mutation rates so

847
01:48:18,400 --> 01:48:23,840
you're my favorite example of and I'm sure there are better ones nowadays when I was reading around

848
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:31,760
this subject my favorite example was um the story told by Ernst Merer about Drosophila fruit flies

849
01:48:31,840 --> 01:48:38,480
being reared in volatile versus non-volatile environments so you're rearing generation after

850
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:45,360
generation at a fairly fixed temperature and then an equivalent set of generations where they've

851
01:48:45,360 --> 01:48:52,240
varied the temperature um you're a few degrees plus and minus um and what they showed was that the

852
01:48:52,240 --> 01:48:58,800
mutation rate of the Drosophila in the volatile changing environment

853
01:48:59,040 --> 01:49:06,560
was greater than the mutation rate the genetic mutation rate in the less volatile population or

854
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:12,240
transgenerational populations which I thought was a beautiful example of selection for selectability

855
01:49:12,240 --> 01:49:20,000
itself that you know that increased variation um certainly or it's you know a phenotypic

856
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:27,440
expression of implicit increased genomic variability was itself an adaptive response to

857
01:49:27,840 --> 01:49:34,080
the rate of change of the environment so my question is is there a similar sort of picture

858
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:45,680
or view of um variation in um either phenotypic or genetic um characteristics in um over a longer

859
01:49:45,680 --> 01:49:54,480
time scale in in sort of um human evolution uh and if there is is there any evidence um

860
01:49:55,040 --> 01:49:58,720
that there's go that there is in the past century or so um

861
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:05,600
perhaps this is a bit of an ambitious uh ask but uh is there any evidence that the

862
01:50:06,640 --> 01:50:12,480
there has been a sort of phase transition in the variability and the evolvability and the

863
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:29,360
associated um phenotypic variation the empirical or an empirical research agenda would be to make

864
01:50:29,920 --> 01:50:35,840
a hierarchical active inference model and perform dynamic causal modeling on different

865
01:50:35,840 --> 01:50:44,880
variability characters across levels of phenotypic and genotypic integration and have that model

866
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:54,800
in use but a very provocative and interesting question Carl

867
01:50:55,040 --> 01:51:06,320
and to what extent is it happening with our cellular architecture and to what

868
01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:15,360
extents are these processes happening with our niche given these unique cumulative cultural

869
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:21,920
generative model generative process thinking through other minds increasingly the production

870
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:32,960
of artifacts that enable not just offloading but outsourcing these do represent unique cognitive

871
01:51:32,960 --> 01:51:45,040
niches and so it will be quite interesting to investigate perhaps if we each want to have

872
01:51:45,040 --> 01:51:56,800
some closing round thoughts perhaps dean with the first word thank you because you know I hate

873
01:51:56,800 --> 01:52:03,920
having the last one I'm just curious gentlemen thank you first again for for your generosity

874
01:52:04,560 --> 01:52:10,400
I'm just curious now that you've dipped your toes in this this active inference institute

875
01:52:10,400 --> 01:52:17,200
live stream world what are your what are your impressions is was it was it it was it helpful at

876
01:52:17,200 --> 01:52:37,840
all who is next you okay so I think that's been very useful and mostly very I mean I've enjoyed

877
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:45,440
a lot to have this discussion with all of you so it's been very enjoyable and just for the future

878
01:52:47,680 --> 01:52:54,400
I'm just wondering if there is such a thing like preempting surprise based on these counterfactuals

879
01:52:54,400 --> 01:53:00,000
I guess maybe it's already written and discussed and it's all clear but I wonder that this might be

880
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:08,240
an interesting idea to explore if I can preempt to surprise before I act I mean for even acting but

881
01:53:08,240 --> 01:53:15,600
that's kind of maybe that's resolved already anyway it has been fun thank you all honestly

882
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:25,200
thank you that makes me think about saying I don't mean to surprise you but that's actually

883
01:53:25,280 --> 01:53:31,280
going to increase it's like oh boy has someone been injured but what is the show not tell

884
01:53:33,040 --> 01:53:42,080
of preempting surprise so that with a linear string in time there is the path from the old

885
01:53:42,080 --> 01:53:51,360
berry patch to the new berry patch such that it appears to be within a nested hierarchical model

886
01:53:51,360 --> 01:54:00,320
the path of least action to follow though in a less nested model it would be quite surprising

887
01:54:07,360 --> 01:54:18,480
Michael or Carl your kind of closing thoughts or questions as we bring this set of 53 to a close

888
01:54:18,800 --> 01:54:24,640
well I'll let Michael have the last word and

889
01:54:26,640 --> 01:54:33,120
what you just said in Hector's comment I think there's a lot of interest in that in that notion

890
01:54:33,120 --> 01:54:39,920
you know sort of trying to preempt surprise I mean a simple reading of risk minimization

891
01:54:39,920 --> 01:54:45,760
you're just basically not engaging in policies that are going to result in surprising outcomes

892
01:54:45,760 --> 01:54:53,120
where surprise is just the violation of prior preferences and so at that level I think that's

893
01:54:53,120 --> 01:55:02,000
that sort of almost a truism but there is an interesting there's an interesting sort of

894
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:08,240
implication of that which leads to notions of the way that we choose to behave epistemically

895
01:55:08,240 --> 01:55:15,760
in terms of avoiding information that would be very surprising sometimes articulate in terms of

896
01:55:15,760 --> 01:55:21,440
optimism bias sometimes in terms of wishful thinking but the kind of paradox that you get

897
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:28,320
when we are Bayes optimal creatures and yet we don't want to open the letter from the GP giving

898
01:55:28,320 --> 01:55:34,720
us our most recent cancer results or we don't want to open that letter whether we fail to get

899
01:55:34,720 --> 01:55:41,600
that job or pass that exam or indeed the anatomy dissection survivor and there are certain things

900
01:55:41,600 --> 01:55:48,000
that we avoid there are certain surprises that we avoid or split another way there are certain ways

901
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:56,400
of preempting surprise by avoiding knowing stuff that we might find surprising and that's an emerging

902
01:55:56,400 --> 01:56:01,600
literature now which takes you a little bit outside your comfort zone but it's a fascinating

903
01:56:01,600 --> 01:56:07,200
literature because you'll find things like trends in cognitive science and and the like

904
01:56:07,200 --> 01:56:12,400
in answer to Dean's question about these sessions because this is not my first session so but

905
01:56:14,240 --> 01:56:22,160
but this does exemplify it yeah it's for fun and we're amongst friends and indulging ourselves

906
01:56:22,160 --> 01:56:28,160
and those people who care to listen to us so I think the next thing to do is the next horizon

907
01:56:28,160 --> 01:56:34,320
although I do think dynamic calls the modeling of evolutionary trajectories is an excellent idea

908
01:56:34,960 --> 01:56:40,640
I suspect the heavy lifting now is to get the ideas that we've been talking about out there

909
01:56:40,640 --> 01:56:46,240
I think that's what Michael and Hector have to do basically it's just keep keep on telling the story

910
01:56:46,240 --> 01:56:50,320
and in my experience usually takes about five to ten years before people start listening

911
01:56:50,880 --> 01:57:00,400
thank you Carl Michael with the last word

912
01:57:02,480 --> 01:57:09,040
well there have been these sessions have been fun and most illuminating there is a lot to be done on

913
01:57:09,040 --> 01:57:15,120
the matter of whether there have been phased transitions in the evolution of what we might

914
01:57:15,200 --> 01:57:20,560
call evolvability in again as Homer over the past two million years there are big

915
01:57:20,560 --> 01:57:27,840
arguments amongst human evolution specialists between whether there was a unitary evolutionary

916
01:57:30,400 --> 01:57:38,160
whether a unitary evolutionary model is acceptable or as lumpers like myself would like to believe

917
01:57:38,160 --> 01:57:47,600
or whether in fact there was a big bush with a lot of dead end separate unsuccessful

918
01:57:48,560 --> 01:58:01,440
species like homo flori ciensis, homo allelusoniensis, homo allelidae or even perhaps Neanderthals

919
01:58:01,440 --> 01:58:05,680
with whom I've had a lot of contact have excavated about 15 of them

920
01:58:06,240 --> 01:58:16,400
and these arguments are highly relevant to the matter of cognitive evolution and indeed

921
01:58:16,960 --> 01:58:25,840
as to whether the record of artifacts and tools can indeed inform us as I believe it can about

922
01:58:26,720 --> 01:58:37,760
just how and how slowly I would say evolution proceeds proceeded and of course the splitters

923
01:58:37,760 --> 01:58:44,800
believe it happened in leaps jumps and leaps I'm rather convinced Darwinist I believe that things

924
01:58:44,800 --> 01:58:51,520
happen very very slowly and that we have to concentrate and with this I conclude on

925
01:58:52,160 --> 01:59:04,400
the especially the neuro epigenetic modification of genetic expression as affecting not merely

926
01:59:04,400 --> 01:59:13,520
morphology and physiology but also I would say cognition and the matter in hand of course

927
01:59:14,080 --> 01:59:24,640
the ability or not to let our surprises affect one lookers and other people

928
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:35,520
permitting let's say modification of behavior in a very wide in a far wider with far wider results

929
01:59:35,520 --> 01:59:44,240
than those that occur in many other species including some of those of our closest

930
01:59:45,200 --> 01:59:52,080
closest primate relatives and thank you very much for organizing this session Daniel and Dean

931
01:59:52,960 --> 02:00:00,240
it's been a pleasure to take part I'm sorry that I have this terrible appearance but I

932
02:00:00,880 --> 02:00:07,920
I really can't do much about that at the moment I had well lost a few days

933
02:00:10,560 --> 02:00:14,320
thank you all Michael at least you have an excuse I have no excuse

934
02:00:20,080 --> 02:00:27,440
all right till next time long live the mean long live the variants thank you

935
02:00:27,440 --> 02:00:30,320
you bye everybody

936
02:00:57,440 --> 02:00:59,440
You
