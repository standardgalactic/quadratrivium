00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,160
Hello and welcome. It's July 29th, 2023, and we're here in session three discussion of

2
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,120
the course, Physicist Information Processing at the Active Inference Institute. We're having

3
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:29,600
a follow-up discussion on Chris Fields' third lecture on quantum reference frames, and we're

4
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:35,080
looking forward to your participation. So if you're watching along live and you've been invited

5
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:41,000
to the calendar event, it's not too late to jump in. If you're watching on YouTube, you can write

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,440
any questions or comments in the live chat with Dean and Andrew here. We're gonna be looking at

7
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:55,280
some of the key points and taking it in a few different directions, sharing our reference

8
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:03,200
frames, making a shared one. So Andrew, be awesome to have you zoom in a little bit on the slide,

9
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:13,080
and then feel free to take us through some of the key points so that we can see a little bit

10
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:22,920
how you're seeing it. Thank you. That looks good. Yep. Okay, so let's start by reviewing the last

11
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,120
lecture from a couple weeks ago, and then we can open up the discussions if there's any questions

12
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:36,240
that appear in the live chat. We can address those. All right, so lecture two, Chris introduced

13
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:44,400
this idea of the information processing between system AMB, you know, where they interact via

14
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:55,040
qubits on a boundary, and they have reference frames that give meaning to this communication.

15
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:04,320
You want to think of information processing as a communication channel, the way Shannon thought

16
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:09,840
about it. So that was the lecture two, and lecture three a couple weeks ago,

17
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:19,520
tried to make this more explicit by emphasizing the idea that this has to be physically embodied

18
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:26,800
somewhere. Okay, and I think that because we are so used to information being fungible,

19
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:35,040
you know small part because of the internet and everything. It's a little hard to understand

20
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,720
at first when the claim is made that you have a QRM, that it's non-fungible, or you have a piece

21
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,480
of quantum information that's non-fungible, or things like the no-cloning theorem,

22
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:53,520
we're so used to information being fungible to it being zeroes and ones, that it's a bit of a

23
00:02:53,520 --> 00:03:00,000
change in mindset at first, but that's exactly what lecture three introduced.

24
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:07,280
This was all stuff, right? Could you maybe just unpack that a little bit? What would it mean for

25
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,560
information to be fungible, or what's that stance like, and then what does it mean for

26
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:19,760
information to be non-fungible, and what is that stance like? Yeah, I'm allowed to get there. So

27
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,720
let me scroll down the slides because that's addressed here. So I was maybe I should have

28
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,720
kept this in the beginning, but anyways, session two talked about how information theory makes

29
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:38,880
this simple and obvious, okay? And in session three, we talk about reference frames and

30
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:45,600
mechanistically how all of this works. So yeah, let's address that question of the difference between

31
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:52,880
between, hold on one second, let me use my mouse to scroll down here.

32
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:04,160
Okay, so that's a little faster, right? Okay, so can you restate your question, Daniel?

33
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:10,320
Yeah, what would it mean for information to be fungible or non-fungible? People might be familiar

34
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:15,120
with that in the economic setting with non-fungible tokens and all of that, but what are we talking

35
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,720
about with informational fungibility? I think it basically comes down to

36
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,560
whether you can replicate. I mean, it's basically the difference between classical

37
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:32,880
and quantum information. As far as I know, fungible information is everything that you can

38
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:41,200
basically turn into a message of zeros and ones. It's, you know, how you transmit it may be different,

39
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,120
you know, the channel, the physical hardware and so on, but at the end of the day,

40
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,440
it's something that you can write on a boundary and something that you can

41
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,040
transmit as zeros and ones. Whereas quantum information,

42
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,560
you literally have to send the hardware, the piece of hardware, the QRF. At least that's how I

43
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:09,840
understand it. So a simple answer might be that it's information encoded in a piece of software

44
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:16,720
versus a piece of hardware, but I don't think that analogy is perfect. Dean, what do you think?

45
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,800
Here's what I'm curious about. And again, you guys can help me with this. As opposed to reference

46
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:32,000
frames, I oftentimes default to frame of reference. And I know that in one of the live streams,

47
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,360
what I tried to bring out was the idea that there was an ice cream cone looking at an ice cream truck.

48
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:44,960
And the question was always whether or not, which one of those two entities, one is in the foreground

49
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:50,080
and one is in the background. And in this slide that Andrew has up, the question is,

50
00:05:51,120 --> 00:06:02,080
is the non-fundability because only A and B can decide whether the A, the VA as seen by B,

51
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:12,320
the A is deeper into that image based on our frame of reference and the B is closer or is the B,

52
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:17,840
the one that's actually deeper and the A is the one that's in the foreground. And I was wondering

53
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:25,280
whether the idea of non-copyability is because of that depth of field aspect that cannot be

54
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:31,520
determined unless it's literally handed over the way that Chris was describing it.

55
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:40,320
I think that's basically accurate. I'm not sure that I can answer the question, but I think

56
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:46,480
I have the feeling that Chris said this in the lecture that, I mean, at the end of the day,

57
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:56,480
the QRF is somewhere in your nervous system. And here, whether, I mean, you bring up a good

58
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:02,800
point, right? It looks like this slide is a bit of an optical illusion. Whether you see A or B

59
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:09,920
deeper, I guess it depends on something going on inside your head. If you, this picture is so

60
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:16,880
symmetrical that if you focus an app on it, you can change your opinion. Well, just to even

61
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:23,120
connect that to what we're talking about, the classical fungible information on the holographic

62
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:31,600
screen on the blanket and then quantum cognitive rotation is those two images are on the screen

63
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:40,160
identical. And then whether it gets a quantum rotation such that the three points of the axes

64
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:47,040
are closer to us than the intersection on that kind of tetrahedron or the other way around,

65
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:52,560
whether the ballerina is rotating one way or the other, that's not on the boundary. So the

66
00:07:52,560 --> 00:08:00,000
information about the depth of field is part of the QRF or part of the enactment of the QRF.

67
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:08,800
And it's not written on the boundary. And that goes back to the preparation question and not

68
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:15,120
just the measuring. Yeah, like at the preparation, if your whole enculturation or the last five minutes,

69
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:23,120
it was entrained or you were holding an object that predisposed you to think that the vertex of

70
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:29,040
the intersection was further away. That's the preparation that sets your prior so that when

71
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:38,640
you get this ambiguous artifact, you rotate it into the most natural position cognitively. And

72
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,080
that's the preparation that sets you up for measurement. No measurement can happen without

73
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:50,080
a preparation. What do you think, Andrew? Sure. Yeah, everything you said makes sense.

74
00:08:52,720 --> 00:09:03,360
So perhaps let me recall what I said around the slides. There was a, in this whole spirit or

75
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:09,840
philosophy of making, emphasizing that information is physical, you know, income from QV, this whole

76
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:21,200
thing. One of the glaring omissions in physics was the embodiment of the reference frame,

77
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:28,480
which was treated as an abstraction, you know, in classical physics, such as by Galileo. But

78
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:34,640
maybe even Einstein, even if he, my hunch is that he did have more of this instinct of, you know,

79
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:40,080
particularly in all those thought experiments of trying to chase the library, you are chasing

80
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:46,400
the library, right? So at the end of the day. But I mean, this is a whole process of making

81
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,320
the observer and the reference frame more and more explicit and more and more physical,

82
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:57,440
because at the end of the day, it has to, right? If you start with this assumption that

83
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:06,080
so it is the assumption almost that, you know, all you see and, you know, it's part of the same

84
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:14,320
material ether that you are, then, you know, then you are part of the universe that you're

85
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:21,040
observing something that is out there. So you need to make, include a theory of what it means for

86
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,760
you to be observing that, right? And at the end of the day, the observer has to be physical.

87
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:31,840
That's what was emphasized by Chris at the beginning of this lecture. So this jump from

88
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:43,440
treating the reference frame as an abstraction to a real physical entity. Yeah, these people have

89
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:51,680
talked a lot about in these papers that are put in there, but I should also remark

90
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:58,880
that if folks want to see this, it's coming up in high energy theory also, in recent work of

91
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:06,960
Saskin and others, where they talk about quantum reference frames, very explicitly. So I don't

92
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:12,960
have the citations of the but, but it's definitely becoming an important thing in the last 20 years.

93
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,800
This attempt to really explicitly treat the reference frame and the observer as a quantum

94
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:28,240
entity, as a physical entity. Okay, so this, that's what I just said. Okay, the jump from

95
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:37,040
treating things, reference frames as abstractions to physical objects. Go. And

96
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:46,800
and because we cannot make a perfect copy of quantum information, we say that these are

97
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:54,800
unique and clonable and unfungible. So in order to recreate an experiment perfectly,

98
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,560
this is that this is addressed as the part of fungibility or not, right? Can Alice,

99
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:06,000
if you have some sort of quantum experiment and Alice and Bob are, you know, it's the usual

100
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:13,680
EPR thought experiment or whatever Alice and Bob are separated by light years.

101
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:21,360
Is it enough if they want to recreate the same exact, the same experiment or Alice to send

102
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:29,360
string of zeros and ones? Well, if you had an experiment where that's enough, then you can

103
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,720
recreate it with fungible information. If not, then you need to somehow send non-fungible

104
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,400
information, which really implies standing a piece of hardware.

105
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:51,200
Um, can I, can I add another, another piece here? Look on the previous slide. So this looks

106
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:58,960
really technical and scientific. But let's think about Alice's laboratory is Alice's

107
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:05,840
brain, mind and Bob's analogously. Alice is thinking about what to say, and then says it.

108
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,600
And that information might be written in a chat form. It might be said verbally,

109
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,960
it might be transmitted through digital or analog signal. But at some point,

110
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:22,160
it's going through this classical informational interface. And then Bob's laboratory is like

111
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:28,960
perceiving and unpacking it. And the question of semantic alignment is such that if Alice gives

112
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:35,440
a shopping list of 10 items, if there's semantic alignment, Bob would be able to go to the store

113
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:41,920
and then find those 10 items. And it made me think of the, the dictionary definition of left

114
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:47,520
and right. So this gets back to our discussion of whether the vertex on these axes is coming

115
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:52,000
towards us or away from us. So I looked up the deck, the dictionary definition of left

116
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:59,440
on towards or relating to the side of a human body or of a thing that is to the west when the

117
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:06,000
person or that thing is facing north. So that's, I guess, one attempt to anchor what it means to

118
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,960
be left. The second definition is the left hand part, side or direction. And you could imagine

119
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:16,960
there's an analogous definition for right. The point is, you can't describe verbally

120
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:26,480
leftness and rightness or chirality in general, because its reference is an embodied perspective.

121
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,560
And so if Alice said, okay, you're going to go down the street and then turn left at the stop sign,

122
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:42,640
how would Alice communicate to Bob what leftness meant at that stop sign versus rightness?

123
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:51,200
And that's this question of flipping. And the way that the quantum formalism accommodates that

124
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:56,960
is through the WIC rotation and the quantum cognitive events, where the fungible,

125
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:04,480
transmittable holographic information gets rotated into the imaginary axis

126
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,480
with the formalisms that enable it to be rotated at all. But that means you could

127
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:20,080
rotate it left quote or rotate it right. Yeah, I think that's, that's a very good explanation.

128
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,200
I don't know if I have much to add, Dean, do you want me to say something?

129
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:32,320
So, but I can't, I don't know the answer to this, but to take what Daniel just said, to take the

130
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:42,320
basic concept of being able to take something that for all intents and purposes can appear one way

131
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:50,000
or another. And then turn that into how Chris closed the last lecture with, we are, we are

132
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:59,920
seeing ourselves as both being entangled and also being separatable. How did we go literally from

133
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:10,320
a three dimension vertex to we're both entangled and we're, we're not living in a paradox. That's

134
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:18,240
just the way it is. We're also removing ourselves or separating ourselves at the same time.

135
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:25,280
That's what I would like to know because somewhere between three arbitrary lines and

136
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:32,640
complexity is not a paradox. Something has to be happening and I'm not exactly sure how that

137
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:44,240
transition plays out. Anybody want to enlighten me? Can you repeat your question please? Well,

138
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:51,360
how do we, how do we go like from the, at this point of the reference frame description of

139
00:16:51,360 --> 00:17:02,240
saying it can't, you can't copy it. All you can do is pass it because we think things could be flipped

140
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:08,960
based on internal, internal reference frames, internal meanings and internal models. The thing

141
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:19,520
we choose for context goes all the way out to the conclusion of Chris's conversation with us in

142
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:27,520
number three where he said, bottom line is, is that it's not a paradox that as things become more

143
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:36,880
and more complex, then it wants to be able, it wants to get to a place of entanglement, alignment,

144
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:45,200
a sense of agreement and at the same time wants to remain separate. So between those two things,

145
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:52,240
a whole lot has happened but, and I don't think we've skipped over it, but we certainly haven't

146
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:59,680
opened it up and really looked at it closely and I'm just curious, what's in between those two

147
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:06,240
scales? I agree. I think we're, we're going to cover that towards the end of the, of the talk,

148
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:13,920
but I agree. I mean, I don't know how you see this related to QRS or the stuff we just talked about,

149
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:17,760
but I think it's the big question in this, in this lecture, right? That was like,

150
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:26,000
where does this tension between increasing complexity and, you know, wanting, wanting to predict

151
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,520
what the environment is doing? One requires entanglement and one requires separability, at

152
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:40,880
least colloquially speaking. I think this tension is basically what the free energy principle comes

153
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:46,560
down to, right? Daniel, what do you think? You have the free energy and you have the E minus TS

154
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:52,640
one is prediction error. I mean, not exactly E minus TS, right? That would be the dynamics, but

155
00:18:52,640 --> 00:19:00,320
you know what I mean? One is prediction error and the other one is, what was it? I can't remember.

156
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:07,760
I'll definitely look forward to the, the technical unpacking that, that you'll get to soon, but,

157
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:14,560
but I was reminded of the William Blake quotation, do what you will, this life's a fiction and is made

158
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:22,880
up of contradiction. So let's modify that, project what you will, rotate what you will,

159
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:29,280
space times a fiction, not that it's false, but that it's a projected fictionalization,

160
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,560
that it doesn't have the ontological primacy that, that's apology of communication does,

161
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:41,760
and is made up of contradiction. Yes. And it's made up of this tension between

162
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:51,760
fitting and not overfitting between aligning and the principle of unitarity and differentiating and

163
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:59,600
becoming through others, we become ourselves and that type of articulation and recognizing that two

164
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:07,440
complementary forces like convex and concave come into existence at once, like a zero to two jump

165
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:16,720
is not an issue or a stumbling block. It's that we wouldn't have it any other way.

166
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:26,240
Couldn't have it any other way. Yeah. Sure. We'll get that towards the end. You can almost

167
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:32,000
even call it a duality. It's not far fetch. I mean, it's the sort of thing that I think most

168
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,320
people will be happy to take for granted such supersymmetry, like you have two kinds of particles,

169
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:44,000
but the same amount of them and dualities that are all over the place. So I think it's fairly,

170
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:50,720
it's not unreasonable to just accept that there is a tension between increasing complexity, which

171
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:58,400
you want you want me to be separable for and accuracy prediction. Now, how this is related to

172
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:08,320
emergent space. And this QRF stuff, you know, I don't want to make very far fetch claims,

173
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:13,760
we'll talk about emergent space later on the course. But for now, let's, let's, let's say a

174
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:18,400
few more words out here. And then we'll get to the complexity stuff towards the end.

175
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:30,800
So, so QRFs are almost building blocks if you want for information processing. Here it's very

176
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:37,760
useful to recall the definition that I feel. I think we, we have mentioned before

177
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:44,160
of information as being differences that make a difference. That's probably the best

178
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:50,480
definition of information I've heard. And I think, I think it does a lot of work. I mean,

179
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:55,440
it's almost mathematical. But anyways, we need to unpack it a little more and see. So

180
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:03,520
for a difference to make a difference, what do you want out of QRF, right? And surprisingly,

181
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:11,920
I mean, not surprisingly, but reassuringly, I think would be the word. You need a QRF to have

182
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:21,600
sensory action and a default state, right? This is sort of like

183
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:29,600
where your Bayesian prior distribution is encoded. These three things will give you a building block

184
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:36,720
for any information processing. And that, you know, ties together with all the work in the

185
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:46,960
pre-energy literature and perception action loops and whatnot. So before we see mathematically

186
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:55,840
how a QRF is defined, I think it's more illustrative. And I think Chris, when exactly on the right

187
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:04,640
order, when he presented this a couple of weeks ago, seen examples from nature. These are actual

188
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:12,960
pieces of forward are effectively QRFs. And it's remarkable how they map to, well, I'll skip ahead

189
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:18,960
a little bit. But when you get to them, to the mathematical definition of the QRF as a quantum

190
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:26,080
system that, you know, you can specify with this category theory diagram, you know, you have

191
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:31,440
incoming arrows into a node that then expands, right? And this roughly corresponds to measurement

192
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,800
and preparation degrees of, not degrees of freedom, degrees of freedom would be the same,

193
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:41,120
right, when you attach it to the boundary. But measurement and preparation stages, I guess,

194
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:49,280
would be the better word. But anyways, let me go back to these examples, right? And Daniel,

195
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:56,880
your biologist here, so correct me if I say anything wrong here. You have a cartoon picture

196
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:04,240
of the bacteria, I think. And this is a very simple sort of thing, right? It navigates in the

197
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:14,000
direction of food. And, and that's it, right? So it is a very simple rudimentary example of a QRF.

198
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,480
You have the sensory

199
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:24,560
stage here, I guess, the degrees of freedom. I guess the degrees of freedom,

200
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:33,360
it's not obvious here what the boundary is. That's one thing. But it is a good enough picture to see

201
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:39,200
the resemblance to here. We have the measurement, which in this, in this case, you're trying to

202
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:51,120
measure concentration of food. You have your node here, C, which is your prior distribution for

203
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:57,200
concentration of food. And finally, you have the output, the preparation stage, which is your,

204
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:03,680
you know, this, the rest of this chemical network that will control and steer this

205
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:08,560
bacterium, right? So there's here, you want to call it the action degrees of freedom

206
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,360
that will steer this bacterium in the direction of food.

207
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:19,520
And likewise with cell division, this I understand even less, the network appears more complicated.

208
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,520
But I think it's fair to say that at the end of the day, all these chemical networks

209
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:32,640
that appear super complicated, somehow have to be mapped to this

210
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:41,520
category theoretical diagram. That's the tolerance to it. You're going to have the sensory input

211
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:49,360
and the action output. And you're going to have the default chemical concentration, which

212
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,240
amounts to this, to this node over here.

213
00:25:52,800 --> 00:26:02,480
You remember this from last lecture, right, Daniel? Yeah. And the cone cocoon we explored also in

214
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:08,880
live stream 17 on the Bayesian semantic information flow. But I'll kind of at a point about these

215
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:18,160
biological systems in relationship to artificially specified systems and what that helps us understand

216
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:26,000
about perception cognition action. So the cone cocoon diagram has this bow tie architecture,

217
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,960
or this kind of like two pyramids touching point to point, where there's a preparation

218
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:38,800
and a measurement, which can be different dimensionalities or different scopes,

219
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:44,880
like you could be multi input multi output or multi input single output vice versa and so on.

220
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:53,280
But they come through this eye of the needle with C prime here. Now contrast that kind of

221
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:59,600
architecture represented here abstractly with what we see in the bacterial process

222
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:08,560
and in the cell division process. These have that kind of a bow tie perception cognition

223
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:16,240
action architecture or measurement cognitive integration, preparation architecture.

224
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:25,760
In contrast, we see, for example, an artificial neural network, where the input and the output layers

225
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:32,720
are usually lower dimensional, maybe an image coming in with several hundred pixels and a

226
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:38,480
single output like a classifier coming out the other end, but a dimensional explosion

227
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:45,680
in those internal cognitive layers. But in biological systems, it's actually exactly the

228
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:52,560
opposite. For example, many, many, many receptors on the cell surface on the holographic boundary,

229
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:58,720
the sensorium of the cell. But then there are these common secondary messengers

230
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:06,320
that many pathways converge upon. So that reflects the kind of radically different

231
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:16,400
architecture that a QRF embodies, as opposed to the approach taken by disembodied intelligence

232
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:24,240
frameworks, which use dimensional explosion internally, to try to categorize and classify

233
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:32,000
and find find edge cases versus this dimensional winnowing that is reflective of these embodied

234
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:41,360
intelligences. And if I may make a tangential comment here also, I think the good thing about

235
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:51,280
these two examples is that they also showcase the fact of how, you know, the deep implications of

236
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:56,640
a scale free biology, if you want to call it this way. We tend to think of these sorts of processes,

237
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:03,840
right, such as here, only happening at the level of the nervous system in animals.

238
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,880
Or, as you said, neural networks, right, we tend to associate this with neural networks.

239
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:16,480
And perhaps evolution is theorizing a way that endowd us with nervous systems to make these

240
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:23,760
things, maybe these are higher up in the layers. But really, that's a bit of an arbitrary distinction

241
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:29,600
that we make. The processes going on at the cellular level, even if they don't appear to have

242
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:37,840
anything to do with the nervous system, my understanding is that there are some generic

243
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:42,400
properties that are the same and everything that has to do with information processing.

244
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:49,680
It manifests maybe slightly different when it comes to explicit nerves, but at the end of the day,

245
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,840
it's the same generic process going on. Would you say that's right, Daniel?

246
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:02,240
The ontological claim is that it's the same generic process happening, whereas the more

247
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:08,240
instrumentalist claim is that we can model it with some shared abstractions.

248
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:14,320
Yeah, okay, so we can continue, right?

249
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:26,480
So, from, you know, I don't have a whole lot to say, Daniel said quite a bit about,

250
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:33,200
at the end of the day, QRF is, you can visualize it as this diagram. And, you know, you can think of

251
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:39,760
it as, if you are more familiar with the picture of neural network and ways on a neural network

252
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:47,600
and so on, that's the way to think about it. Now, let's continue with explicit embodiment,

253
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:56,960
if you wish. So, QRFs in the formalism have to be attached to a boundary,

254
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:01,040
boundary, degree, supreme. And I should add another remark here, I think,

255
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:09,360
and personally, to me also, like the hard part about this quantum pre-energy

256
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:13,600
principle formalism, if you wish, is what you said at the beginning is the fact that it's

257
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,520
topological, right? So, very often it's not clear what the boundary, degree, supreme are,

258
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:22,000
right? Because we tend to think of boundaries as, you know,

259
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:30,560
geometrical, and certainly the classical FEP treats them as geometrical, but that's not the case here

260
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:37,520
in the quantum pre-energy formalism. And where we have merchant space, as we'll be talked about

261
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:44,720
in later sessions, that's just like one quick remark to make. At the end of the day, though,

262
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:51,120
even if it's topological, we're going to have real degrees of freedom that this

263
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:59,600
QRF is attached to, this cone-cocoon diagram. And you're going to have measurement operators that

264
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:12,240
yield classical outcomes, class of minus one. And then you can think of this QRF,

265
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:19,520
or more abstractly, this cone-cocoon diagram as a neural network, if you wish, acting on those

266
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:26,400
boundary qubits. And then backpropagating some sort of action signal preparation.

267
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:40,960
Okay, then let's not forget that the Landau's principle and so on requires that we are mindful

268
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:47,840
of energy constraints on computation. And that gives us the following picture.

269
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,600
Number one, we're going to have to

270
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:03,280
use energy from the environment to fuel our computation, to fuel our observation.

271
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:10,320
That means that right away, you cannot use the entirety of your boundary to gather information.

272
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:21,280
It necessitates an allocation of resources. Here, E is the observed environment,

273
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:28,560
and the blue portion is a thermodynamical sector, where you extract free energy and

274
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:35,040
heat in order to run this computational process. And then furthermore, you can have

275
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,520
a memory sector where you write things on the boundary. And this takes up energy also,

276
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:45,920
writing information on the boundary by Landau's principle. We'll take up information.

277
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,720
And Chris called this the minimal interest in observer,

278
00:33:52,480 --> 00:34:00,240
because it has a memory sector. And why minimal here implies that we have at least

279
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:07,920
minimal interest thing implies that we have more than one layer. Here, the process of

280
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:15,600
writing things into a memory sector requires us to have a clock so that we can label

281
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:21,760
those memories in time. So we do have time as part of this formalism, just not space yet.

282
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:26,480
Okay. And time has to be internal to the observer.

283
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:39,200
Just one piece on that that Chris mentioned. And as you echoed, time here is an attribute of

284
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:47,040
some cognitive systems in terms of their internal understanding so that they can sort

285
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:54,720
memories and understand what came earlier or later. It's not something that's a priori defined

286
00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:01,280
externally, which is the case in the kind of space time first. Now, how do we fit communication

287
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:09,120
into here? We flip that, we're talking about the topology of communication as ontologically

288
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:16,240
primal. And now certain kinds of sophisticated agents, that's not like necessarily true of rock

289
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:23,360
or a metronome or a particle of a gas, but some kinds of cognitive systems are such that they

290
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:31,040
are able to generate an internal clock concept. And that doesn't have to be the same thing as

291
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:35,760
what's happening on the wall with chronos. This can reflect a purely internal time,

292
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:40,800
kairos that enables observers or interactors that have different clock structures. And then

293
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:48,720
Landauer's principle helps us arbitrage or connect the informational demands to the energetic or

294
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:57,280
the metabolic demands. Bean? So when I first listened to the lecture, I thought when the

295
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:08,160
term or phrase trade off was raised, I traditionally have thought of trade off as kind of a binary.

296
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:15,360
If I'm picking this, I'm trading off against all the other things that I didn't pick,

297
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:24,800
so one or the other or others plural. But when I saw this, and especially when I heard it in

298
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:33,360
the context of things like degrees of freedom, I began to wonder whether it is because it could sit

299
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:39,680
on either side of that boundary. It could be a priori or it could be ad hoc or post hoc, a trade

300
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:50,080
off, which prior to this conversation, I just assumed that a trade off was one or the other.

301
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:58,720
But essentially what this implies is it isn't even, it's still a kind of a degree of

302
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:06,880
of how much weight you put into it. And then it kind of crossed a threshold and then you've made

303
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:14,720
your pick. You've completed your trade off. Or did I, again, did I misinterpret what I was

304
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:23,120
hearing? If it's topological, as opposed to the more conventional space time perspective.

305
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:31,520
Is this, can a trade off be both ad hoc and post hoc, seemingly at the same time?

306
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:43,280
Very interesting question. Let us just let it float and continue on, enter.

307
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:53,920
All right. Because again, if it's, I'll just say this, if it can be, that would really move us

308
00:37:53,920 --> 00:38:01,200
out of the classical realm. That would essentially say that anytime we've made a pick,

309
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:07,280
we really haven't made a pick. There's still a whole bunch of other things that are going to happen

310
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:17,200
that can change whatever that action is that we thought we carried out or enacted.

311
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:26,480
If we're talking about an internality state, which is what I think we want,

312
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,200
I think we want to be able to change our minds.

313
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:41,920
Let me take that one way, Dean. The analytical equations of the action perception loop

314
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:49,520
don't tell us in implementation, like if we're going to write it in code, whether we should

315
00:38:50,480 --> 00:39:00,800
use action first procedurally to update our observations, or whether we enable our observations

316
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:08,560
to wag the dog and then select action at the end of the loop. So is it a perception action loop,

317
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:17,520
or is it an action perception loop? And those enable a kind of seesaw where sometimes we want

318
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:24,960
what we learn to change what we do, and other times we want what we do to change what we learn,

319
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:33,680
and having that kind of a fulcrum or a pivot, and then again to connect it to the vertex popping

320
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:40,320
in and out, the analytical formalisms inscribed on the screen of the FEP, like the textbooks,

321
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:48,640
they're ambiguous whether we lead with action and have inference follow, or whether we lead

322
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:55,440
with inference and have action follow, or lead with action and have inference follow, whichever

323
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:07,040
one of the combinations there are, and then that trade-off or run-off is broken by specific

324
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:16,000
embodied cognitive agents. That trade-off about the procedural primacy of perception or action

325
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,480
can't be broken generically. Right.

326
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,160
It certainly makes for a lot of waste heat if you're not careful.

327
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,960
It'd be exhausting a lot anyway.

328
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:53,520
Okay, so I see, I don't know if we can talk about intent much with this formalism,

329
00:40:54,080 --> 00:41:01,280
but we can take a very descriptive approach to it and go down here a little more.

330
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:07,680
Actually, before I don't want to get ahead of myself, what I mean by that is

331
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:18,640
whether we can put intent or not in this hierarchy, I don't know if it matters a whole lot,

332
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:26,800
but at least we can talk about it operationally and descriptively and say just like when you have a

333
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:36,720
clock, that clock is just there. If you don't have the clock, you don't have the memory,

334
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:45,760
and that's it. Unlikewise here, if we don't have an attention control compartment, we cannot play

335
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:55,840
with all these QRFs that are non-commutative at the same time. If there is no attention control

336
00:41:55,840 --> 00:42:01,440
system to begin with, we cannot talk about a system that has non-commutative QRFs,

337
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,520
meaning here one presumably goes to memory sectors, the other one goes to environment

338
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:18,880
sectors and so on. This is certainly a necessity of the fact that we have different sectors of

339
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:24,080
the boundary being allocated to different purposes, such as environmental observation

340
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:34,080
and memory and so on. Within the environment, it's worth remarking that here if you think deeply

341
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:41,920
about first principles and what it means to observe an entity, well, you still come down

342
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:47,840
to these differences that make a difference sort of thing, which involves whenever you're looking

343
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:54,320
at the environment, if you're going to identify a system, you need sort of a background that tells you

344
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:01,440
that puts the system in context so that you can identify the system as something distinct.

345
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:08,640
I think this again is something that we have talked about in previous discussions, where

346
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:15,200
the easiest picture here is something like the speed gauge in your car, where

347
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:25,440
the P is the gauge itself that tells you the speed, but it's meaningless without the reference

348
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:32,800
system. Outside of the thing that stays invariant, the context, the background,

349
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:41,360
that gauge moving means nothing to you. So come back to this idea of if we think of

350
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:45,840
information as differences that make a difference, in terms of first principles,

351
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:52,160
this environment sector that we saw earlier has to be further broken down into pointer and

352
00:43:52,160 --> 00:44:01,200
reference states. Again, this is covered in the increases papers. I'm thinking particularly of

353
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,320
free energy for generating quantum systems.

354
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:15,600
Again, just to reiterate, this attention controls that compartment, which is by the way very reminiscent

355
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:22,640
to the hierarchy that was earlier with the clock arising higher up in the hierarchy,

356
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:30,480
deeper into the layer. Likewise, whenever you're writing something into a memory,

357
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:35,840
you need to have that clock. Whenever you are deploying noncommittative QRFs, you're going to

358
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:44,800
need an attention control compartment. We just described this operationally. If you didn't have

359
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:50,480
it, then the agent would not be what it is. It could not deploy those noncommittative QRFs.

360
00:44:50,640 --> 00:45:02,560
So marching on, we'll just end here with the QRF alignment and the free energy principle.

361
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:07,760
Just a few more words. This is possibly the most interesting picture in this

362
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:17,120
presentation. We can recall here the possibilities for QRF alignment and how

363
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:29,120
free energy comes into play in this formalism. We call A the trivial interaction. We call this

364
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:36,400
a thermal interaction. Then you have a bunch of possibilities. Depending on each possibility,

365
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:45,520
you're going to see things as notes or as in the paper says, non-local in variables.

366
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:56,400
The last situation is what we call alignment when we have QRFs of the same size perfectly aligned.

367
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:01,040
I can't quite recall. I think this

368
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:14,240
would be the situation where you have noiseless classical computation. You have A and B just

369
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:25,360
interacting. This is the situation where, correct me if I'm wrong, Daniel. This is

370
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:34,560
entanglement, asymptotically. Once all the QRFs are aligned, you have entanglement. Now we can tie

371
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:43,280
back maybe to gains earlier. So these two slides conclude the discussion, basically, and then we

372
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:51,440
can open it up. So given these possibilities for how QRFs can be aligned, QRFs deployed by A and B

373
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:57,600
can be aligned, and how in each situation you're going to get noise or whatever,

374
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:07,440
then what does the free energy principle say in this quantum setting? Well,

375
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:18,480
minimizing variational free energy leads you to entanglement. So if theorem here,

376
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:27,600
if you're in the picture of B here, and the QRFs are aligned, A and B are going to be entangled.

377
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:38,960
Now there is a tension between this tendency towards alignment, as the free energy principle

378
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:49,840
will carry you, and observe reality, which is that we're not just a blob of entangled particles.

379
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:56,720
So there is separability, and systems are a tension between maintaining separability,

380
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:02,640
and at the same time being correlated enough to the environment,

381
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:09,920
which has to be able to predict the outcome. And now we can maybe go into a more philosophical

382
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:17,760
discussion on the free energy principle. I should also say, in the last month, just like I talked

383
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:26,640
earlier about QRFs, Lenny Saskin, whose recent paper that talks about QRF, he led me into a

384
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:34,160
rabbit hole of looking into his recent work, and he's talked a lot about complexity. I'm being

385
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:42,240
very speculative here, so if someone can pull me out, that would be good in the comments. But

386
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:49,440
just to skim it through some of his papers, I saw a monograph in 2018 where he talks about complexity,

387
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:57,760
and he puts forward the second law for complexity in quantum systems, an increased complexity,

388
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:02,080
and it is very reminiscent of what's going on here. You have a tension between

389
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:09,920
systems standing to entanglement, and the other side of the free energy functional

390
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:16,960
if you wish, where systems increase in complexity, and that necessarily requires

391
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:24,000
that AMB are separate. So Daniel, do you have any comments at this point?

392
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:33,040
Yeah, there's a lot to it. I like that you showed the four possibilities

393
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:43,280
in the image above and said it was one of the most interesting figures. I agree, and

394
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:55,680
how to connect this to the classical FEP, and also how to see the quantum FEP

395
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:04,560
not as just a second story built on top of the classical FEP, which would be kind of like a

396
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:13,760
historical chronological understanding of the theoretical apparatus, but it's almost like

397
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:23,920
the quantum FEP was like a basement we didn't know about, because it gives a broader context,

398
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:30,400
and though it appeared conceptually several years later in the timeline we understand,

399
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:42,400
that doesn't give it a secondary status. So what it really means for the classical FEP

400
00:50:43,360 --> 00:51:01,760
to be kind of like a special case of this actually more generic setting, there's just a lot I'm

401
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:09,280
very uncertain about. I can wrap it up, and then if Dean or you want to say something,

402
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:14,720
we can continue with that, but let me conclude, and this is all I have to say for today,

403
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:25,120
I think I'm sure Chris will explain this more in coming sessions and lectures, but I think the

404
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:33,200
main key difference is in the emergence of space, how it might emerge from something more fundamental,

405
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:41,200
maybe a sense of network or who knows, but that's the big difference, and I suppose the

406
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:46,560
quantum free energy principle generalizes the classical free energy principle, because he

407
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:56,880
doesn't have this spatial embedding. Now this to me personally and also to folks in the audience

408
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:04,480
for asking questions is probably the hardest part to wrap your head around, and I foresee

409
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:10,960
interest in those discussions and lectures that deal with the concept of emergent space,

410
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:17,200
because every time you try to, and I've done this myself, I've been thinking about how you could

411
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:23,920
apply this formalism to better known pictures or compare it for instance with thermal equilibrium,

412
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:27,360
with relaxation with thermal equilibrium, and then you start thinking about okay what is the

413
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:33,520
boundary and so on, it's far from obvious, because again you have to remind yourself that the

414
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:42,160
definition is topological, so in that regard I think it might be worth talking about one of the

415
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:48,240
questions that came up that I thought was good, and then I can call it a day on this end,

416
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:56,000
so this question, and I think it was the first question asked since the last lecture.

417
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:00,880
Can you just read the full question and then read the full answer, thank you.

418
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:05,600
The question on the answer, it's number 28 here, can you guys see it? Should I zoom in a little bit?

419
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:12,480
It's pretty small, but reading it will be good. Okay, so this question I think, I fast myself this

420
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:19,920
question too, maybe in a different way, but basically it gets to the point of what I was

421
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:28,560
saying earlier, that it would be nice to see how we can use this quantum free energy principle

422
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:34,640
formalism to recover maybe familiar settings, such as relaxation to thermal equilibrium,

423
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:39,760
the equation, but that's far from obvious how you do it if your definition is topological.

424
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:46,480
So the question says, what happens when the agent becomes identical to the environment,

425
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:51,600
when the model has been improved so much that it does not differ from the environment, is this

426
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:57,920
a stadium impossible, would it be thermo-amical equilibrium maximum entanglement? Okay, so clearly

427
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:02,160
it's not thermo-amical equilibrium, but I think what the person is asking if I maybe,

428
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:07,600
if I'm understanding this correctly, they're wondering, okay, so if the free energy principle

429
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:15,360
drives AMB towards entanglement, then it's referred to say that they have, that any distinction

430
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:19,360
between them has been solved, right, that they have merged into the same thing.

431
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:28,400
And that has to do with this whole definition of philosophical debate of thing-ness, that Carl

432
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:34,880
Christon, you know, is a proponent of, right, what it means for two things to be separate. Okay,

433
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,200
so let's see what Chris said.

434
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:45,040
Christon has pointed out that the limit of the classical FEP, the limit of perfect

435
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:48,400
prediction, corresponds to the general synchrony between system and environment,

436
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:56,160
each sense messages that the other can perfectly predict. Now, however, it's clear,

437
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:01,920
I'm not reading anymore, I'm making a quick remark here, I'll continue in a second.

438
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:10,400
In the classical FEP, it's clear that AMB, even if they are, you know,

439
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:18,000
in the perfect limit of the FEP, they remain different, different entities, right, because

440
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:27,920
you have that, if you wish, that extra layers of differentiation coming from the spatial embedding,

441
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:33,360
right, in the classical FEP, that is clear, that they haven't, even if they are getting

442
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:38,960
synchronized, they have not lost their separate identities, you can always say, well, this is

443
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:43,760
the one that was to the left, and this is the one that was to the right, pun intended in the earlier

444
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:54,400
discussion, right. You have that extra resource for separating them, if you wish, by virtue of the

445
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:59,440
spatial embedding, right, the spatial embedding is giving you this extra information that allows

446
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:05,360
you to keep track of AMB separately. Okay, so I'll continue, this notion depends on the system

447
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:10,320
and its environment being separated and has distinguished somehow, in classical formulations,

448
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:16,000
they are separated in ordinary 3D space, i.e., they occupy different locations, so they are

449
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,920
different because they occupy different locations, right, but if you don't have that geometrical

450
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:26,560
background, then how do you know that they're different, right? Okay, so I continue, the quantum

451
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:31,120
formulation is background free, meaning it assumes no spatial embedding, system and environment do

452
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:35,120
not have different locations, even though they have different sets of degrees of freedom in

453
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:42,640
the overall Hilbert space. Here, the FEP, the limit of the FEP is maximum entanglement,

454
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:46,800
this does not mean that the system and its environment are identical, they are, and since

455
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:52,640
they have different degrees of freedom, okay, so this is just addressed as the question I just

456
00:56:52,640 --> 00:57:01,280
posed, it means that the joint state is not separable, okay, into a system S and environment T,

457
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,320
their states are no longer conditionally independent, this is distinct from thermal

458
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:10,320
equilibrium, which means that they have the same temperature while remaining separable,

459
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:16,000
and that their interaction can be characterized as the change of thermal fluctuations,

460
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:24,800
you know, so I guess this is a nice format for things that are to come, but I do think that this

461
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:34,320
whole idea of emergent space is going to be possibly, you know, one of the most important in

462
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:42,240
the course, and it's going to help stick out between the class and quantum formulations for sure.

463
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:50,560
Dean, what's your take on this? What I saw was that when you have that kind of alignment,

464
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:59,360
that perfect alignment, that is one, that was one, that was D in that diagram, right, that was one

465
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:06,800
state of a complex state that included an A and a B and a C, and probably a whole bunch of other

466
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:15,840
ways that, yeah, right, so that one state where you've got this kind of entanglement

467
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:22,160
isn't into perpetuity, like you don't get there and then stay there, and that's where I think

468
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:31,360
the question of separability and complexity, it still works, because just because you've momentarily

469
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:37,200
gotten to a place that we define here as D, doesn't mean you stay there indefinitely.

470
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:46,400
You could be swapping around to B and C and A in the next instant, so that's, at least that

471
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:54,880
holds the complexity piece up, that moment for however long that moment is, where XA and XB

472
00:58:54,880 --> 00:59:02,160
are aligned isn't permanent, so it's not predictable in that sense, therefore it is complex.

473
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:09,600
I still don't know how we get, though, that the closer we get to agreement, the more complex

474
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:16,320
things are, unless we're just talking about D in this array of A, B, C, and D.

475
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:23,040
That goes back to that quantum reference frame. I think, like I said, again,

476
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:30,160
maybe I'm interpreting this wrong, but when I message pass, the reason why I have to, like,

477
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:35,680
literally give it over to the other person and let them have it, I can't give them, have them copy

478
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:43,280
what I'm doing, is because there has to be, I guess that reinforces the separability piece of

479
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:48,800
this as well, the fact that I can't give them a copy that I can only give them the information,

480
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:55,600
and then they've got to sort of unpack it in their own, in their own way of taking it off the

481
00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:07,040
boundary. But again, I struggle with this, I'm guilty as charged, but I am, what I'm trying to do

482
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:14,080
is trying to come up with my own narrative so that what Chris is saying makes sense to me,

483
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:18,000
as opposed to make sense to the world, which is what Chris is trying to do.

484
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:29,040
I'll try with another speculative fiction. So there's a screen between, let's just say, the

485
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:34,160
stage in the audience or whatever, it's a holographic screen. And on each side of the screen,

486
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:43,280
there's some embodied object. So that means that it must have, it's a volume-enclosing

487
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:49,600
object, because points and lines and planes are only abstractions, every real physical object

488
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:58,080
encloses volume. And now a light is going to be coming from behind each object facing the screen.

489
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:04,640
And that's this kind of cone that we're seeing from each side, it's like the shadow cast by the

490
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:12,720
object. So if the object was a sphere, then it would be projecting down to a circle onto the screen.

491
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:19,920
If the shape were a cube, it could be projecting down. And so where the light is positioned

492
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:30,640
is the perspective that that cognitive entity is taking on its QRF. Those lights could move. So

493
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:35,040
now we have this situation where the two spotlights are moving, maybe the shapes are staying the same,

494
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:41,040
maybe they're changing too. And it's like two searchlights scanning across this

495
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:50,960
B oval. And sometimes they are perfectly locked. I mean, there could be a situation where they're

496
01:01:50,960 --> 01:02:00,560
perfectly aligned. Or there could be situations where they're totally disjoint. And each of those

497
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:12,720
situations have different implications for what one entity sees when it looks at the screen.

498
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:19,840
Maybe like the shadow is the only part where you can see, because the rest of it is too blinding

499
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:29,040
or something like that. And so then if we're in case A here, where maybe B doesn't have a projection

500
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:36,160
or maybe B's projections totally somewhere else, then A is in this solipsistic, I'm the active

501
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:48,480
agent interacting within an inert world setting. And D is like potentially the computer engineer's

502
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:56,320
classical dream or asymptote, which is like all the data going through the USB cable is just

503
01:02:57,120 --> 01:03:05,760
being perfectly noiselessly received. And then we also get these B and C cases.

504
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:15,840
But A is kind of like the inert world. D is like the perfect communication channel and then to

505
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:20,640
connect it just to Friston's concept of generalized synchrony. As we've talked about many times,

506
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:26,800
generalized synchrony doesn't mean lockstep. Two agents could reduce their uncertainty about

507
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:32,560
each other, not by doing the same thing at every time step, but for example, by turn taking.

508
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:38,800
And I think that points the way to how we get reduction of variational free energy, reduction

509
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:46,400
of prediction error, surprise and so on, without especially spatial temporal enmeshment, but not

510
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:52,800
necessarily even informational identity enmeshment, because you could have two things that through

511
01:03:52,800 --> 01:04:00,560
their alignment become actually differentiated. And that could increase the mutual information

512
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:05,600
between two metronomes, not just to have them going in the same direction, but to have them

513
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:11,280
going in opposite directions, the mutual information those two settings is going to be high.

514
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:18,480
So it's not the case that generalized synchrony means that things are becoming

515
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:31,040
blurred. We could actually also have integrated information through increased

516
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:40,960
articulation, not just decreased. And then life finds a way or cognition finds a way

517
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:53,120
on this trade off frontier of in our pursuit of unitarity, will we blur to unify or will we

518
01:04:53,120 --> 01:05:01,200
differentiate to unify? But those are the paths we have, we don't have the backwards ratchet.

519
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:05,840
Yeah, yeah, makes sense.

520
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:22,320
Any other ladder slides, Ender? No, that's it. So Chris made a few more remarks at the end of

521
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:32,000
language here. But he mentioned that he's going to talk more about this in the coming lecture,

522
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,840
so we'll just leave it up to him.

523
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:48,320
Yeah, there could be some very powerful and interesting linguistic opportunities

524
01:05:48,960 --> 01:06:04,560
for updating our speaking to reflect what we are learning here. I don't know what those necessarily

525
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:13,360
are. Whether it's a syntactic or semantic thing or whether it's a narrative thing,

526
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:24,720
but how to actually re enter some of these formalisms into our focus understanding

527
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:35,520
could just be immensely powerful. And we could have a lot of integrity between the natural

528
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:44,240
language way that potentially we're already showing up for engagement and some of these

529
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:52,480
formalisms that get to first principles about interacting entities and boundary conditions

530
01:06:52,480 --> 01:07:01,200
and all of that. Dean, any penultimate thoughts? Not really. I'm going to go back and listen to

531
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:07,120
the I'm going to listen to Chris's comments again about this common cause and the fine

532
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:13,120
tuning assumption and whether that's sort of a metaphorically a dialing in or what it what he

533
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:18,560
what he means exactly by the fine tuning in the in the context of this conversation today.

534
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:24,160
What you just kind of said about are we dulling something here or are we sculpting something

535
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:32,320
to make it more fitable? Like, I'm going to go on now and go back and listen to what he

536
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:36,640
talks about in terms of fine tuning and maybe update my priors around that. So

537
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:46,480
And are any last thoughts or maybe scroll over to the schedule of the course again just so we

538
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:56,000
can close on that. Yeah, we're halfway through. We just completed the third discussion section now.

539
01:07:56,640 --> 01:08:02,400
So we've had three lectures and three discussions. It's all downhill from here.

540
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:07,680
By the way, this was the first midterm. You guys both did well.

541
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:16,320
Um, we're going to head into four, or like session four, with these last three, how agents use

542
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:19,920
multiple communication channels and that's going to get connected to the quantum FEP.

543
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:25,680
How space time emerges from communication, which is something that we've brought up a

544
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:30,000
bunch. It's been in the background, but but making that explicit is going to be exciting.

545
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:38,560
And then section six, I think is just going to be such a jumping off point because the scope

546
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:47,360
and the intensity of what is transpiring is extreme. So connecting it to biology,

547
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:54,960
which is to say life more fully and where we go in, in 23 and beyond,

548
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:58,720
that's going to be awesome. So any last words, Andrew?

549
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:02,400
Uh, no, I was just going to go with what you said.

550
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:09,120
Very, I would, I would say it's going to be uphill in, in terms of how interesting it's going to get.

551
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:13,600
Up hill in the good sense, meaning that we're planning.

552
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:22,080
Cool. Well, I encourage people to check out the course website and submit questions that they'd

553
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:27,600
like to see addressed by Chris also to register and join these participatory discussions. There'll

554
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:36,240
be three more of them. So if you want to join, share your QRF, be part of the publication of

555
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:43,040
all of these works that we'll compile at the end and just get your exoskeleton in the game

556
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:51,040
with what is happening here. It'd be really awesome to hear more voices and to have more on board.

557
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:56,240
Okay. Thank you, Dean and Andrew. Till next time.

558
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:24,240
Thank you.
