00:00.000 --> 00:14.040
Hello and welcome, everyone. It is September 14, 2023. And we are in the course, Physics

00:14.040 --> 00:20.200
as Information Processing. It's lecture five. Looking forward to this lecture, and then

00:20.200 --> 00:23.600
a little conversation, Chris, off to you. Thank you.

00:24.600 --> 00:32.600
Okay. Thank you, Daniel. And welcome to session five of Physics of Information Processing.

00:32.600 --> 00:42.600
And today we're going to talk about space time. And particularly about the idea that

00:42.600 --> 00:51.600
space time is emergent from information processing. And this has now become a very mainstream idea

00:51.600 --> 00:59.600
in the quantum information and quantum gravity communities. And there's still, of course,

00:59.600 --> 01:07.600
some people holding out for the idea that space time is fundamental. But I would say that

01:07.600 --> 01:17.600
at least in these communities, I expect it's become now the dominant idea that space time

01:17.600 --> 01:27.600
is not fundamental, that space time is not part of the basic ontology of reality or something

01:27.600 --> 01:36.600
like that. And that, instead, space time is a construct. So that's what today's session is going

01:36.600 --> 01:47.600
to be about. So for those of you who are just joining or who would like a little review, we

01:47.600 --> 01:55.600
started this course talking about quantum information theory. And the idea that quantum

01:55.600 --> 02:03.600
information theory is actually a new science about systems that communicate across a boundary.

02:03.600 --> 02:13.600
And the systems are always called Alice and Bob for kind of historical reasons. And emphasize

02:13.600 --> 02:21.600
that this new science is topological. It's about connectivity between systems. It's not

02:21.600 --> 02:29.600
geometric. So it doesn't assume a space time embedding. So it leaves open the possibility

02:29.600 --> 02:39.600
that space time is actually a construct. It doesn't assume space time up front. And in

02:39.600 --> 02:46.600
the second session of the course, I think we talked about how this boundary could always

02:46.600 --> 02:53.600
be represented as an array of qubits and that what the systems on each side of the boundary

02:53.600 --> 03:00.600
do to communicate is prepare and then measure the states of these qubits. So they communicate

03:00.600 --> 03:15.600
by exchanging classical information via a quantum channel. And this introduces a particular kind

03:15.600 --> 03:23.600
of quantum noise whenever they don't share the reference frames that they use to prepare the

03:23.600 --> 03:32.600
bits and measure the bits. So it's not necessarily a perfect communication channel from a classical

03:32.600 --> 03:39.600
fidelity point of view. But all of the noise is quantum noise. It's not classical. And it always

03:39.600 --> 03:46.600
derives from differences in the reference frames that are used by the two agents. We

03:46.600 --> 03:54.600
reformulated the free energy principle in this setting. And the free energy principle turns out

03:54.600 --> 04:01.600
to be very simple. It turns out to be a classical limit of the principle of uniterity, which is just

04:01.600 --> 04:10.600
the principle that information is conserved. And we saw that the approach to perfect alignment

04:10.600 --> 04:17.600
between the two agents or perfect prediction on the part of the two agents becomes more

04:17.600 --> 04:24.600
challenging, not surprisingly, as system complexity increases. So the more complex the

04:24.600 --> 04:32.600
communication, the harder it is to predict, as one would expect. In the last session, we talked

04:32.600 --> 04:43.600
about how constraints on thermodynamic free energy induce compartmentalization in agents. So

04:43.600 --> 04:54.600
whenever agents interact with their environments in fairly complex ways, then they end up being

04:54.600 --> 05:01.600
compartmentalized into compartments that have to communicate classically. And this is solely

05:01.600 --> 05:08.600
a result of quantum information theory. You don't have to assume any biology to get this

05:08.600 --> 05:14.600
compartmentalization. But clearly, this is something that we see in biological systems. Not

05:14.600 --> 05:23.600
only do we see compartments, we also see hierarchical control, which is likewise a sort of

05:23.600 --> 05:33.600
automatic outcome of the theory for complex systems. And finally, last time, we talked a

05:33.600 --> 05:41.600
little bit about how these compartments communicate and introduce the idea of communication

05:41.600 --> 05:49.600
protocols that involve local operations on a shared quantum resource of some kind, and

05:49.600 --> 05:57.600
classical communication. And we talked to Fermat about how classical communication is a

05:57.600 --> 06:05.600
little bit problematic to define in quantum theory because, of course, you're introducing

06:05.600 --> 06:13.600
classicality. And so you have to make some very specific assumptions about what's classical. And

06:13.600 --> 06:24.600
we'll see later on today what the key assumption that gives you classicality is as we talk about

06:24.600 --> 06:35.600
spacetime. But before I go into the topic of spacetime, I want to spend a little time...

06:35.600 --> 06:42.600
OK, so this, sorry, this is where we're going. We're talking about spacetime, and we'll talk

06:42.600 --> 06:49.600
about applications to biology next time. But before we get going on this, I want to spend

06:49.600 --> 06:59.600
a little bit of time talking about explanation. And this is motivated by a question that came

06:59.600 --> 07:05.600
up, a very long question that touched on many different topics that came up in the interactive

07:05.600 --> 07:17.600
Q&A last time. And a fair amount of that question had to do with, directly or indirectly, the

07:17.600 --> 07:27.600
question of what scale-free explanation looks like and how it compares to scientific explanation

07:27.600 --> 07:36.600
in general, most of which is reductive. So I want to make a short detour into the question

07:36.600 --> 07:44.600
of how reductionist theories, which all of you are probably very familiar with, relate to

07:44.600 --> 07:52.600
scale-free theories. And particularly, the free energy principle is a scale-free theory.

07:52.600 --> 08:02.600
So it's a theory that's unlike most of the theories that most of you probably learned about

08:02.600 --> 08:12.600
in college. So we're all familiar with reductionist theories and the reductionist idea of scientific

08:12.600 --> 08:20.600
explanation, which is really an outcome of philosophy of science in the 20s and 30s. People

08:20.600 --> 08:28.600
like Rudolph Carnap were among the first to actually make precise what this idea of reductive

08:28.600 --> 08:40.600
explanation is. But the basic idea is that the laws or the dynamics or the formalism that

08:40.600 --> 08:49.600
describes behavior at some micro scale, the behavior of little things, actually explains

08:49.600 --> 08:59.600
the behavior of big things. So the basic reductionist idea is that what the little things are doing

08:59.600 --> 09:09.600
is what's important. And what big things are doing are either emergent phenomena or they're

09:09.600 --> 09:17.600
just epiphenomenal. They're essentially just appearances. And this defines a fundamental

09:17.600 --> 09:24.600
scale. So the real assumption in any reductionist theory is that there's some fundamental scale

09:24.600 --> 09:32.600
at which the real dynamics takes place and everything else is just an appearance or some sort

09:32.600 --> 09:40.600
of emergent phenomenon. And I try to be very careful when I use the word emergence because

09:40.600 --> 09:45.600
it's one of the most ambiguous words in the philosophy of science and people use it to mean

09:45.600 --> 09:55.600
all sorts of different things. But whenever you say emergent, it always sort of implies the idea

09:55.600 --> 10:05.600
that it's emergent from something. And so the idea of emergence is essentially a reductionist idea

10:05.600 --> 10:15.600
because it at least implicitly assumes that there's some micro scale from which the macro scale is

10:15.600 --> 10:26.600
emergent. And so the discussions of emergent phenomena are offered very consistent with

10:26.600 --> 10:38.600
reductionism even if they claim not to be. And we're all taught that science is reductionist.

10:39.600 --> 10:46.600
And there are certainly people who publicly claim that science is reductionist. Richard Dawkins

10:46.600 --> 10:54.600
is certainly a shining example of this. But I suspect that a lot of scientists just kind of pay

10:54.600 --> 11:01.600
play lip service to reductionism without really believing in it because they don't really believe

11:01.600 --> 11:09.600
that the macroscopic phenomena that they are studying, life, for example, is completely determined

11:09.600 --> 11:17.600
by what's going on at the micro scale or what's going on at the micro scale plus some stochastic

11:17.600 --> 11:27.600
noise or something like that. So I want to explicitly contrast this with a scale free theory.

11:27.600 --> 11:37.600
In a scale free theory is not simply a holistic theory. It's much more precise. In a scale free

11:37.600 --> 11:46.600
theory, little things and big things obey the same laws or they have the same dynamics where

11:46.600 --> 11:53.600
they're described by the same formalism. So it's not that the macro scale is emergent from the

11:53.600 --> 12:02.600
micro scale. The macro scale and the micro scale actually obey the same laws. And the

12:02.600 --> 12:12.600
relationship between macro and micro is probably best stated as what implementation of macro

12:12.600 --> 12:19.600
scale things have micro scale components and those micro scale components are doing something

12:19.600 --> 12:31.600
or other and whatever they're doing implements the macro scale system and its behavior. But this

12:31.600 --> 12:42.600
implementation is not an explanation or at least it's not an explanation all by itself. And the

12:42.600 --> 12:48.600
bumper sticker version of scale free theories is just as above so below. Whatever laws you have at the

12:48.600 --> 12:55.600
macro scale are the ones the same ones you have at the micro scale and vice versa. So scale free

12:55.600 --> 13:04.600
theories in a sense are simple. It's the same theory at every level of description. So what is this

13:04.600 --> 13:13.600
idea of scale? And how does it relate to what we've talked about in this course? Well, what we've

13:13.600 --> 13:20.600
talked about in this course all has to do with what an agent can observe on its boundary. So scale

13:20.600 --> 13:28.600
has to do with how information is encoded on the boundary. And we can describe that scale in many

13:28.600 --> 13:37.600
different ways. Here's a commonplace way to describe it in physics by a relationship between

13:37.600 --> 13:49.600
energy and distance or size. And you've probably all heard of the Planck scale. The Planck scale is

13:49.600 --> 14:00.600
the smallest scale at which current physics makes any sense. And in energetic terms, it's defined by

14:00.600 --> 14:11.600
energies on the order of 10 to the 19th GEV, which is gigo electron volts. The LHC, the Large Hadron

14:11.600 --> 14:21.600
Collider in Switzerland, gets to about 10 to the 4th GEV. So many, many orders of magnitude less than the Planck

14:21.600 --> 14:31.600
scale. So the Planck scale is extremely energetic compared to what we can probe experimentally. The Planck

14:31.600 --> 14:41.600
scale energy of 10 to the 9th GEV corresponds to a distance of about 10 to the minus 35 meters, which is

14:41.600 --> 14:51.600
incredibly tiny. An intermediate scale on this diagram is about the scale of a nucleon. So, for example, a

14:51.600 --> 15:01.600
proton or a neutron, they have a rest mass of about one GEV and a size of about one femtometer. So this

15:01.600 --> 15:11.600
intermediate scale is roughly the scale of nuclear physics. And then if you go to our scale, the scale of

15:11.600 --> 15:22.600
things that are about a meter in size, human beings, tables and chairs, lots of animals, the things we're most

15:22.600 --> 15:30.600
familiar with, that corresponds to an incredibly tiny energy. 10 to the minus 5 electron volts is about the energy of a

15:30.600 --> 15:47.600
photon of radiation. And a meter is about the wavelength of long-wave radio. So if you think about visible light, it has a

15:47.600 --> 15:54.600
wavelength of about 10 to the minus 5 meters and energy of about an electron volt. So it's not surprising that visible light

15:54.600 --> 16:04.600
feels energetic to us because it's orders of magnitude above our natural scale of energy of this sort of thermal

16:04.600 --> 16:21.600
environment in which we exist. So it's the encoding scale on the boundary that is going to relate theories of things that we

16:21.600 --> 16:32.600
see to each other. And this ends up giving a kind of complicated picture. If you think of Alice interacting with Bob and measuring

16:32.600 --> 16:44.600
things on the boundary. Sorry, I'm a little bit ahead of myself. I just wanted to show you a picture of a reductive theory.

16:44.600 --> 16:54.600
This is the Big Bang. You're all familiar with this. Something happens at the Planck scale and the entire universe results from it by

16:54.600 --> 17:05.600
just a scale change. So this is a reductive theory. A scale-free theory is much more complicated. So here's what a scale-free

17:05.600 --> 17:20.600
theory looks like. Alice interacts with Bob and she's looking at her boundary. And her boundary states, the boundary states she sees could be

17:20.600 --> 17:33.600
encoded at different scales. So there may be a small scale, scale one, and a bigger scale, scale two. And what Alice is looking for is some

17:33.600 --> 17:46.600
reductive theory that relates the first scale, the micro-scale, to the macro-scale. And so it's not that the micro-scale came first, like it

17:46.600 --> 17:57.600
did in the Big Bang, and the macro-scale came later. These are encodings that can be happening simultaneously. And the theoretical

17:57.600 --> 18:09.600
task is to find theories that relate between these scales. And these are implementation theories, or you might call them embedding theories from one

18:09.600 --> 18:21.600
scale into another. And what we want as a consistency criterion is for these theories to be constant in time. So as Bob evolves in

18:21.600 --> 18:32.600
time, and so what Alice sees are these encodings on her boundary, she wants the relationship between encodings at different scales to stay

18:32.600 --> 18:42.600
constant. Because if it doesn't, she'll never be able to figure anything out. She'll just have this chaotic relationship between things happening at

18:42.600 --> 18:57.600
different scales, and nothing will make sense. So you have this complicated picture in scale-free theories. And if you look at this, and it seems vaguely

18:57.600 --> 19:12.600
familiar, or even vaguely, even very familiar, then it should. Because this is exactly the kind of explanatory structure or semantic structure that you

19:12.600 --> 19:22.600
have in computer science. If you're studying the behavior of a computer, which is just some piece of hardware, some physical

19:22.600 --> 19:34.600
system, then you can describe what that piece of hardware is doing at different scales. And in fact, what we call the hardware level of

19:34.600 --> 19:46.600
description, when we talk about, you know, our laptops, for example, is typically the level of description of circuits of transistors inside

19:46.600 --> 19:56.600
microprocessors. We think of that as the hardware level. But of course, that's just a description, too, that's layered on top of lots of much smaller scale

19:56.600 --> 20:12.600
dynamics, all the way down to the scale of atoms and eventually nuclei and elementary particles and all that other stuff. So there's some quantum stuff that's going on that we

20:12.600 --> 20:27.600
describe as having a classical hardware level of bit exchange. And then we describe the behavior of programs on top of that. So what we want, what makes a

20:27.600 --> 20:45.600
computer useful is that we can assign semantics to programs. And we can talk about semantic relationships between programs, for example, the relationship between the internet

20:46.600 --> 21:04.600
protocols, stuff that zoom is doing, and what you actually see on your user interface and here on your user interface, that needs to stay fixed over time, or zoom becomes incomprehensible and not programmable and in fact

21:05.600 --> 21:20.600
not even well defined as an algorithmic system. And the same is true for the relationship between the operating system and the hardware description, or between the operating system and zoom is a program. So computer

21:20.600 --> 21:39.600
science works in exactly this scale free way. And so in a sense, scale free explanation is very familiar. It's exactly the kind of explanation that we have in computer science. And that's why I refer to the relationship

21:39.600 --> 22:01.600
between scales as one of implementation, because that's a term that we're familiar with from thinking about computers implementing programs. So what are these theories, and if we think in biological terms, we can think of pathways

22:01.600 --> 22:22.600
embedded in a cell, or cells being embedded in tissues, all the way up to niches of various kinds, which may be social niches, being embedded in ecosystems and ecosystems being embedded in the biosphere. And so we have all of these essentially semantic

22:22.600 --> 22:43.600
theories that talk about how one scale embeds in another scale. And if we have these sorts of scale transitions, we can think of representing the relationship between transitions at different scales, in terms of the activity of some kind of

22:43.600 --> 23:09.600
renormalization group, which is transforming entities and processes at one scale into entities and processes at another scale. And I think in biology, we can at least put forward the hypothesis that in all the way from pathways

23:09.600 --> 23:29.600
embedding in cells to ecosystems embedding in the biosphere, we could put forward the hypothesis at least that the renormalization group flow across all of these scales is trivial. That is that the embedding theories all have the same formal structure.

23:30.600 --> 23:54.600
The structure that describes how pathways embed into cells is the same structure that describes how ecosystems embed into the biosphere. Now I certainly can't prove that. I believe that it's likely.

23:55.600 --> 24:05.600
So I think it's an interesting hypothesis to investigate. And this is an hypothesis that I want to leave you with.

24:06.600 --> 24:09.600
As a result of this class is something to think about.

24:11.600 --> 24:21.600
To what extent, in thinking about biological systems or even social systems are the embedding theories the same.

24:22.600 --> 24:39.600
So in thinking this way that the physics of the situation is has the same formal structure as computer science has in terms of explanation.

24:40.600 --> 24:49.600
Oh, we're of course faced with a problem, which is that we're not just reconstructing physics.

24:50.600 --> 24:57.600
We're talking about the physics of of interacting observers. We're talking about the physics of communication.

24:58.600 --> 25:03.600
So we're modeling how we do physics.

25:04.600 --> 25:07.600
And that makes our theory self referential.

25:08.600 --> 25:20.600
And so we have to base the music from Gertl's theorem, which tells us essentially that powerful self referential theories can't be both consistent and complete.

25:21.600 --> 25:28.600
And by powerful, I just mean powerful enough to express arithmetic. So not terribly powerful.

25:29.600 --> 25:34.600
So this becomes an issue that we have to live with.

25:35.600 --> 25:50.600
We will always be faced with this issue of having to construct metatheories, which tell us how our lower level theories work.

25:51.600 --> 25:53.600
But we never get to the end of that process.

25:53.600 --> 26:06.600
We never can get to theories that are both consistent and complete because our tower of theories becomes progressively actually more powerful as it goes up.

26:07.600 --> 26:13.600
So Gertl, in a sense, poses a problem.

26:14.600 --> 26:27.600
But in another sense, just tells us what life is like as a scientist that you can't have everything all the time doing science.

26:28.600 --> 26:29.600
But we probably all already knew that.

26:30.600 --> 26:52.600
So let's now talk about space, end of digression, and see how these ideas apply to a system or a tower of systems that can construct a spatial embedding in its world, in its observed world.

26:53.600 --> 27:05.600
So let's start out thinking about a system that can see its environment, but what it sees as a completely uniform environment where nothing is happening.

27:08.600 --> 27:17.600
So if you have a uniform environment where nothing is happening, you can't distinguish one part of the environment from another.

27:18.600 --> 27:22.600
So you have no sense of space.

27:23.600 --> 27:34.600
So what I want to do is build up from scratch what's needed to have a sense of space.

27:35.600 --> 27:41.600
And then we'll talk a little bit about what organisms are doing.

27:41.600 --> 27:56.600
And I think a very interesting question is, if you look at phylogeny, at what points in phylogeny, what lineages in phylogeny actually need to have a sense of space?

27:57.600 --> 28:05.600
And what do they have to have in terms of computational power to have that sense of space?

28:06.600 --> 28:11.600
So if you just have a uniform environment, you don't have a sense of space.

28:13.600 --> 28:24.600
But the first thing we can do with an environment is to divide it up into some number of parts that are somehow distinguishable.

28:26.600 --> 28:31.600
So suppose we can segment the environment into two different parts.

28:31.600 --> 28:40.600
And if you think about E. coli, for example, E. coli has a bunch of sensors on the front and a bunch of effectors on the back.

28:41.600 --> 28:48.600
So it can sense much more about the front part of the environment than the back part of the environment.

28:49.600 --> 28:56.600
So already with E. coli, you have this kind of segmentation of the environment into parts.

28:57.600 --> 29:00.600
But so far, nothing has happened in this environment.

29:00.600 --> 29:03.600
We just have segments that can be distinguished.

29:05.600 --> 29:14.600
So let's consider an environment like this that has distinguishable segments.

29:15.600 --> 29:23.600
What one next wants to know about these segments is whether they're next to each other.

29:24.600 --> 29:29.600
And if we just have a bunch of segments, we just have a set.

29:30.600 --> 29:37.600
And a set doesn't have any order or any relationship information.

29:38.600 --> 29:47.600
So I've drawn this environment as a rectangle of rectangles, but that's just a representation.

29:48.600 --> 29:54.600
And it looks like there are relationships between these rectangles.

29:55.600 --> 29:58.600
But if they're just a set, then there are no relationships.

29:59.600 --> 30:03.600
If we want to add relationships, then we have to add them explicitly.

30:04.600 --> 30:15.600
So let's add some connections between these different segments of the environment to turn that set into a graph

30:15.600 --> 30:22.600
that says explicitly, for example, that the light green segment is attached to the light blue segment.

30:23.600 --> 30:26.600
And it's also attached to the dark green segment.

30:27.600 --> 30:33.600
And the dark blue segment is attached to the light blue segment and attached to the dark green segment.

30:34.600 --> 30:39.600
So now we have something that's much more mathematically complicated than a set.

30:40.600 --> 30:42.600
We have a graph that has some connection information.

30:42.600 --> 30:44.600
So we have a connection to apology.

30:46.600 --> 30:49.600
Now, adding this topology does something very important.

30:50.600 --> 30:55.600
It breaks the exchange symmetry that is there if you just have a set.

30:56.600 --> 30:59.600
So if we just have a set, it doesn't make any difference.

31:00.600 --> 31:10.600
If I exchange, for example, the positions of the upper right light blue segment with the upper left light green segment.

31:10.600 --> 31:15.600
But if we have this connection to apology, then it does make a difference.

31:16.600 --> 31:27.600
I've twisted the graph around, and if I have to break connections to exchange things, then I've actually changed the topology.

31:28.600 --> 31:40.600
So adding a topology, adding connections can disrupt a symmetry that's there if there is no topology.

31:41.600 --> 31:49.600
So now let's think about, now we have the structure that's required to think about something happening.

31:50.600 --> 32:03.600
So suppose that at some time, as measured in the bit counter time reference frame of the observing system, something happens.

32:04.600 --> 32:06.600
So a dot appears in the light green segment.

32:07.600 --> 32:13.600
And we can express this actually in the notation of quantum field theory.

32:13.600 --> 32:26.600
We can think of the light green segment as a field, and the dot appearing is the occurrence of an excitation in that field.

32:27.600 --> 32:38.600
And so we can write this notation that says that the green field was excited to produce a dot, which is up arrow green dot.

32:39.600 --> 32:55.600
And some time after that, it may turn out that the dot disappears in the green field, and some sort of dot appears down at the dark blue field.

32:56.600 --> 33:04.600
And again, we can write this in this kind of creation and destruction operator notation that one has in quantum field theory.

33:05.600 --> 33:13.600
And so this says that the green field is no longer excited, but now the dark blue field is excited.

33:14.600 --> 33:21.600
So this doesn't imply anything about these excitations being the same. In fact, they're completely different.

33:22.600 --> 33:27.600
One is an excitation of the green field and one is an excitation of the blue field.

33:28.600 --> 33:30.600
But at least now something is happening in the environment.

33:31.600 --> 33:42.600
So we can think about what does it take for an observer to notice that something is happening in its environment?

33:43.600 --> 33:51.600
It has to be able to detect a change occurring in some segment of its environment.

33:52.600 --> 34:01.600
And that change can involve something happening or something stopping happening in that segment of its environment.

34:02.600 --> 34:08.600
But it doesn't yet have to have any idea of what an object is.

34:09.600 --> 34:30.600
But we can add that if the system has a memory, we can have the system connect these events happening in different parts of its environment.

34:31.600 --> 34:41.600
So if the system has a memory that has some number of steps, say in steps, but here it could even just be two steps,

34:42.600 --> 34:55.600
it can see transitions between these two different states where there's a dot in the green field and then a dot in the dark blue field

34:55.600 --> 35:02.600
and then a dot in the green field and then a dot in the dark blue field and then a dot in the green field, etc.

35:03.600 --> 35:11.600
So I've expressed this in this sort of field theory notation over on the right side.

35:12.600 --> 35:17.600
And what this is is a flip-flop. It's an observed periodic behavior.

35:18.600 --> 35:23.600
So this is the basic idea behind a clock.

35:24.600 --> 35:39.600
So any observer that can see this, a number of time steps internally, can interpret what's going on in its external environment as a clock ticking.

35:40.600 --> 35:42.600
It can see some periodicity.

35:42.600 --> 35:54.600
So as long as you can have memory and the ability to detect change, you can see periodic behavior in the environment.

35:55.600 --> 35:58.600
So you can see the environment acting like a clock.

36:01.600 --> 36:07.600
So let's think a bit about what this does and does not require.

36:07.600 --> 36:16.600
So seeing a clock in the environment requires having distinguishable, non-exchangeable sectors of the environment.

36:17.600 --> 36:22.600
So you have to have this connection to apology that breaks the exchange symmetry.

36:23.600 --> 36:31.600
It requires having these sectors implement some sort of flip-flop, so something periodic happening.

36:32.600 --> 36:36.600
And you have to have enough memory to see that periodicity.

36:37.600 --> 36:42.600
But it doesn't require any sense of object identity.

36:43.600 --> 36:52.600
So the excitation in the green part and the excitation in the blue part can still just be field excitations of the green part and the blue part.

36:53.600 --> 36:58.600
There's nothing that says that those have to be the same thing.

36:59.600 --> 37:02.600
They just have to appear and disappear in some periodic way.

37:04.600 --> 37:07.600
And having a clock doesn't require a metric space.

37:08.600 --> 37:12.600
You don't need to have any sense of distance defined on the environment.

37:13.600 --> 37:18.600
You just have to have this segmentation that is not rearrangeable.

37:19.600 --> 37:26.600
So this tells us something extremely important, which is that time is more fundamental than space.

37:27.600 --> 37:35.600
Time in the exterior environment is much simpler and easier to observe than space in the exterior environment.

37:36.600 --> 37:47.600
So for thinking biologically about phylogeny, we might expect to see organisms that can detect periodic behavior in the external environment.

37:48.600 --> 37:53.600
Long before they can detect spatial organization in the exterior environment.

37:54.600 --> 38:01.600
And we know that organisms, even down to microbial mats, can respond to the diurnal cycle.

38:02.600 --> 38:09.600
So we know that organisms, in a sense, can detect environmental clocks.

38:10.600 --> 38:16.600
Even organisms that we have no reason to believe divide the environment up into spaces,

38:17.600 --> 38:21.600
or the sort of space that we're used to, like a Euclidean space.

38:23.600 --> 38:29.600
So now we're about adding space to this idea of time in the environment.

38:32.600 --> 38:36.600
So the next step is to be able to see motion.

38:37.600 --> 38:46.600
And being able to see one thing move from one segment of the environment to another segment,

38:47.600 --> 38:52.600
as opposed to something happening in one segment, and then something happens in another segment.

38:53.600 --> 39:01.600
One has to have this idea of object persistence, that there's a thing that has an identity,

39:02.600 --> 39:06.600
and its identity doesn't change over time.

39:07.600 --> 39:13.600
And it doesn't change when you move it someplace else, when it appears someplace else in the environment.

39:14.600 --> 39:16.600
It's the same object.

39:17.600 --> 39:24.600
So this is an idea that psychologists call object persistence,

39:25.600 --> 39:29.600
and it's an idea that physicists call translational invariance.

39:30.600 --> 39:34.600
Translational invariance means two things.

39:35.600 --> 39:41.600
It means that if I have an object and I move it to a different location, I don't change the object.

39:42.600 --> 39:45.600
It's the same object that I move from here to there.

39:46.600 --> 39:48.600
So the location doesn't change the object.

39:49.600 --> 39:51.600
But it also means the reverse of that.

39:52.600 --> 39:55.600
It means that the object doesn't change the location.

39:56.600 --> 40:03.600
My container remains invariant, even though I move the object around in it.

40:04.600 --> 40:08.600
So these are kind of the two faces of translational invariance,

40:09.600 --> 40:12.600
and they're the two faces of object persistence.

40:13.600 --> 40:18.600
As the object moves through time, its identity remains fixed,

40:19.600 --> 40:23.600
and it doesn't change the time that it's moving through.

40:23.600 --> 40:27.600
So if I'm measuring its motion with a clock,

40:28.600 --> 40:31.600
moving the object doesn't change the clock.

40:33.600 --> 40:36.600
These are clearly very classical ideas.

40:38.600 --> 40:42.600
And we talked about earlier classical communication.

40:44.600 --> 40:48.600
And when we talked about classical communication,

40:48.600 --> 40:52.600
and for example the context of a Bell EPR experiment,

40:53.600 --> 40:58.600
we talked about the observers being able to write down some data

40:59.600 --> 41:03.600
on a piece of paper or on a disk drive or something,

41:04.600 --> 41:07.600
and hand those data to someone else.

41:08.600 --> 41:10.600
So this is translational invariance.

41:11.600 --> 41:14.600
The data can't change when Alice gives it to Bob.

41:14.600 --> 41:18.600
Otherwise there isn't classical communication taking place.

41:19.600 --> 41:22.600
And of course there's an up to noise built into here.

41:23.600 --> 41:27.600
The piece of paper might get wet and the ink might run a little bit,

41:28.600 --> 41:30.600
but it's still the same message.

41:31.600 --> 41:33.600
There's still some identity being assumed.

41:34.600 --> 41:39.600
So object persistence is not an idea we get from quantum theory.

41:39.600 --> 41:43.600
It's an idea that we impose on top of quantum theory.

41:44.600 --> 41:47.600
And it's this idea that's intrinsically classical.

41:48.600 --> 41:53.600
So we're looking right here at the quantum to classical transition.

41:54.600 --> 41:55.600
This is it.

41:56.600 --> 42:00.600
This is what gets added to quantum theory to get classical physics.

42:01.600 --> 42:03.600
It's this idea of object persistence.

42:04.600 --> 42:06.600
Now once we have object persistence,

42:06.600 --> 42:10.600
we can kind of go to town constructing space.

42:14.600 --> 42:17.600
And here's how we do it.

42:19.600 --> 42:23.600
We all learned about object persistence this way

42:24.600 --> 42:28.600
when we were six months old doing motor babbling

42:29.600 --> 42:34.600
and observing our hands and feeling how our bodies worked.

42:34.600 --> 42:39.600
And seeing objects that we could manipulate

42:40.600 --> 42:43.600
and that didn't change when we manipulated them.

42:44.600 --> 42:47.600
So this is the birth of object persistence.

42:48.600 --> 42:53.600
This is the birth of classicality in human psychology.

42:57.600 --> 43:00.600
So now let's start thinking about building a coordinate system.

43:01.600 --> 43:02.600
What's a coordinate system?

43:02.600 --> 43:06.600
A coordinate system is just a set of labels that are attached

43:07.600 --> 43:09.600
to these segments of the environment.

43:10.600 --> 43:13.600
And to build a coordinate system, you have to have an origin.

43:14.600 --> 43:18.600
And an origin means an object, something that's fixed,

43:19.600 --> 43:21.600
something that doesn't move around.

43:22.600 --> 43:27.600
And so a coordinate system requires the ability

43:27.600 --> 43:30.600
to identify a stigmurgic memory.

43:31.600 --> 43:35.600
Requires the ability to find something in the environment

43:36.600 --> 43:40.600
that has a meaning that stays constant over time.

43:41.600 --> 43:44.600
And that's what a stigmurgic memory is.

43:45.600 --> 43:47.600
It's something in the environment that provides us

43:48.600 --> 43:52.600
with a memory resource that we can count on being the same.

43:53.600 --> 43:58.600
And it's having this fixed point

43:59.600 --> 44:03.600
that allows us to label these connected segments

44:04.600 --> 44:08.600
of the environment that contain objects that move

44:09.600 --> 44:12.600
and be able to say, okay, the object moved

44:13.600 --> 44:15.600
from this part of the environment to another part.

44:16.600 --> 44:19.600
And I can give those parts labels with respect

44:19.600 --> 44:24.600
to this other part that doesn't move, this origin point.

44:25.600 --> 44:30.600
And once I have this, I can construct other invariances.

44:31.600 --> 44:34.600
So for example, I can consider an object that rotates

44:35.600 --> 44:37.600
around this origin without changing its identity.

44:38.600 --> 44:42.600
And that defines what's called rotational invariance.

44:43.600 --> 44:48.600
And I can also talk about an object that gets bigger

44:49.600 --> 44:54.600
and smaller compared to this fixed point.

44:55.600 --> 44:57.600
And that defines radial distance.

44:58.600 --> 45:02.600
And if you think about the baby in the previous slide

45:03.600 --> 45:06.600
that's doing motor babbling, it sees things getting smaller

45:07.600 --> 45:09.600
as it moves them farther away.

45:10.600 --> 45:14.600
So the visual system does this computation for us

45:15.600 --> 45:18.600
and constructs this radial coordinate for us

45:19.600 --> 45:23.600
with our bodies or specifically our heads, our eyes.

45:25.600 --> 45:32.600
So in doing this very early motor activity,

45:33.600 --> 45:36.600
we're actually building the spatial coordinate system

45:37.600 --> 45:40.600
for our brains that's implemented by the hippocampus,

45:41.600 --> 45:43.600
the place cells in the hippocampus.

45:44.600 --> 45:48.600
And if I have an origin point in the environment,

45:49.600 --> 45:53.600
I can also infer that I am moving,

45:54.600 --> 45:58.600
that I have changed my location with respect to that object.

45:59.600 --> 46:04.600
And that's a considerably more complicated inference

46:05.600 --> 46:08.600
because you have to have a representation of the self of you

46:09.600 --> 46:10.600
to say I moved.

46:11.600 --> 46:14.600
So this is something that comes after you've developed

46:15.600 --> 46:16.600
this spatial coordinate system.

46:16.600 --> 46:19.600
You have to be able to locate, in a sense, metacognitively,

46:20.600 --> 46:24.600
a particular object that's you in that coordinate system.

46:26.600 --> 46:31.600
So we're going to set that aside and now talk about adding

46:32.600 --> 46:34.600
some numbers, so adding a metric.

46:35.600 --> 46:41.600
And adding a metric requires another particular kind of object,

46:42.600 --> 46:49.600
which is a ruler, a particular fixed object that can be moved

46:50.600 --> 46:54.600
around and that has translational invariance

46:55.600 --> 46:58.600
and rotational invariance up to some transformation,

46:59.600 --> 47:00.600
up to some tensor.

47:01.600 --> 47:04.600
And in Euclidean space, that tensor is the identity.

47:05.600 --> 47:09.600
So in Euclidean space, you have perfect translational

47:09.600 --> 47:10.600
and rotational invariance.

47:11.600 --> 47:14.600
As you get into general relativity,

47:15.600 --> 47:18.600
then the ruler can actually change its length as you rotate

47:19.600 --> 47:22.600
or the ruler can change its length as it moves through space.

47:23.600 --> 47:26.600
So effectively, your space time can deform.

47:27.600 --> 47:29.600
The coordinates of your space time can deform

47:30.600 --> 47:32.600
and that gives you the representation of mass,

47:33.600 --> 47:34.600
of course, in general relativity.

47:35.600 --> 47:42.600
So we talked several sessions ago about quantum reference frames

47:43.600 --> 47:47.600
and I use the example of rulers and clocks as quantum reference frames.

47:48.600 --> 47:54.600
So now we see how to construct those from observations

47:55.600 --> 47:58.600
and symmetry breaking and object identity,

47:58.600 --> 48:03.600
all of which we need to define a quantum reference frame

48:04.600 --> 48:06.600
out in the environment like a ruler.

48:07.600 --> 48:11.600
And notice that we don't need any of that environmental stuff

48:12.600 --> 48:17.600
to define those QRFs within our own processing.

48:18.600 --> 48:22.600
And in fact, the ones that exist within us,

48:23.600 --> 48:25.600
we have no direct access to.

48:25.600 --> 48:29.600
We can look at someone else's brain and talk about

48:30.600 --> 48:32.600
their spatial representation system,

48:33.600 --> 48:35.600
but we can't look inside our own brains

48:36.600 --> 48:38.600
and talk about our spatial representation system.

48:39.600 --> 48:45.600
So this is how we get a metric space from the ground up.

48:46.600 --> 48:50.600
And we've talked about this from a very psychological

48:51.600 --> 48:53.600
or biological point of view.

48:53.600 --> 48:59.600
Starting from sort of motor capabilities,

49:00.600 --> 49:02.600
motor babbling, for example,

49:03.600 --> 49:09.600
a measure of effort, which gives you some sense of mass.

49:10.600 --> 49:12.600
So if it's easy to move something, it's light

49:13.600 --> 49:15.600
and if it's hard to move something, it's heavy.

49:16.600 --> 49:20.600
And we understand that when we're six months old

49:20.600 --> 49:23.600
because we can measure how much force we're having to apply

49:24.600 --> 49:25.600
with our muscles.

49:26.600 --> 49:31.600
We have a reference internally for this force that we're applying.

49:32.600 --> 49:37.600
And we use that internal measurement to attribute

49:38.600 --> 49:41.600
this idea of mass to things in the environment.

49:42.600 --> 49:44.600
We have to have memory from manipulations.

49:45.600 --> 49:49.600
We have to be able to identify variances that define

49:50.600 --> 49:53.600
objects, object persistence.

49:54.600 --> 49:56.600
And we have to be able to build a ruler

49:57.600 --> 50:01.600
that we can move around and use to define a metric space.

50:02.600 --> 50:06.600
Now, this is very different from the way physicists approach this.

50:07.600 --> 50:09.600
And if you look at the physics literature,

50:10.600 --> 50:12.600
then people start with information transfer.

50:13.600 --> 50:17.600
They talk about entanglement as a basic resource.

50:18.600 --> 50:23.600
There's a lot of discussion of bulk boundary duality.

50:24.600 --> 50:29.600
And the most well-known one is the duality between antideciderspace,

50:30.600 --> 50:32.600
which is the sort of space you see inside a black hole

50:33.600 --> 50:38.600
and conformal field theory, quantum field theory on the boundary

50:39.600 --> 50:40.600
of the black hole.

50:41.600 --> 50:45.600
So things you can see, for example, going on on the horizon

50:45.600 --> 50:49.600
of a black hole or dual to the geometry in the interior

50:51.600 --> 50:53.600
by this mathematical relationship.

50:54.600 --> 50:56.600
You can use that mathematical relationship

50:57.600 --> 50:59.600
to construct a quantum error correcting code

51:00.600 --> 51:06.600
by using the symmetries of the field theory

51:07.600 --> 51:09.600
as a resource for redundancy that allows you

51:10.600 --> 51:12.600
to represent the same thing in different places.

51:12.600 --> 51:14.600
And as soon as you can do that,

51:15.600 --> 51:17.600
you can build up a network of elements

51:18.600 --> 51:20.600
that look basically like elements of a lattice.

51:21.600 --> 51:27.600
And a lattice is a graph to which you can assign

51:28.600 --> 51:32.600
some metric relationships and you get a metric space.

51:33.600 --> 51:37.600
And in physics, typically the goal is to get Einstein's equations

51:38.600 --> 51:40.600
out of this to start with some information,

51:40.600 --> 51:44.600
theoretic sorts of constructs, and get the equations

51:45.600 --> 51:46.600
of general relativity.

51:47.600 --> 51:49.600
But what are the equations of general relativity?

51:50.600 --> 51:52.600
I mean, these are things that Einstein derived

51:53.600 --> 51:55.600
by doing fairly simple thought experiments

51:56.600 --> 52:05.600
using the invariances of ordinary Euclidean space

52:05.600 --> 52:10.600
combined with ideas from special relativity

52:11.600 --> 52:12.600
about the speed of light being constant.

52:13.600 --> 52:16.600
And he added the principle of equivalence,

52:17.600 --> 52:22.600
which is the idea that essentially mass

52:23.600 --> 52:24.600
and acceleration are the same thing,

52:25.600 --> 52:28.600
or that gravity and acceleration are the same,

52:29.600 --> 52:31.600
the weight and acceleration are the same thing.

52:32.600 --> 52:36.600
So it's at least reasonable to expect

52:37.600 --> 52:45.600
that this inferential process that's going on

52:46.600 --> 52:50.600
in theoretical physics is generating the same thing,

52:51.600 --> 52:53.600
although in a very formalized way,

52:54.600 --> 52:59.600
that we can generate by thinking about how organisms deal

52:59.600 --> 53:00.600
with their environments.

53:01.600 --> 53:05.600
And so I want to leave this with you

53:06.600 --> 53:08.600
as the second hypothesis here.

53:10.600 --> 53:15.600
The first one was the hypothesis about a trivial

53:16.600 --> 53:20.600
renormalization group flow across scales and biology.

53:21.600 --> 53:25.600
The second hypothesis is that these two approaches

53:25.600 --> 53:29.600
to emergent spacetime are actually giving us

53:30.600 --> 53:35.600
the same information and maybe starting out

53:36.600 --> 53:38.600
with the same information, in fact,

53:39.600 --> 53:43.600
that we may be able to think about these fundamental

53:44.600 --> 53:49.600
building blocks of information flow and entanglement

53:50.600 --> 53:53.600
in terms of the sorts of perceptual relationships

53:53.600 --> 53:57.600
that we've been talking about in this class.

53:58.600 --> 54:05.600
So there's our second hypothesis to think about going forward.

54:07.600 --> 54:10.600
And I just want to leave you with the idea that organisms,

54:11.600 --> 54:16.600
at least, manage this very interesting process

54:17.600 --> 54:26.600
that we can think of starting with the construct of memory.

54:27.600 --> 54:31.600
Organisms have memory at multiple scales,

54:32.600 --> 54:37.600
and it's memory that allows them to formulate the idea

54:38.600 --> 54:39.600
that there are objects.

54:40.600 --> 54:44.600
And as soon as you have objects that persist,

54:44.600 --> 54:46.600
you have a source of redundancy.

54:47.600 --> 54:49.600
So you can do error correction.

54:50.600 --> 54:52.600
And if you can do error correction,

54:53.600 --> 54:57.600
if you can move the same thing from one place to another

54:58.600 --> 55:00.600
and have it encode the same information,

55:01.600 --> 55:02.600
then you can build spacetime.

55:04.600 --> 55:06.600
And as soon as you have spacetime,

55:07.600 --> 55:09.600
you can use the spacetime as more memory.

55:10.600 --> 55:15.600
You can use the spacetime itself as an error corrected code

55:16.600 --> 55:21.600
because spacetime has the nice ability to hold lots of copies

55:22.600 --> 55:24.600
of some informative structure.

55:25.600 --> 55:27.600
So you can build libraries or you can build computers

55:28.600 --> 55:30.600
or you can build the internet if you have spacetime,

55:31.600 --> 55:32.600
which gives you more memory,

55:33.600 --> 55:34.600
which gives you more object persistence,

55:35.600 --> 55:36.600
which gives you more error correction,

55:37.600 --> 55:38.600
and the circle just spins around.

55:39.600 --> 55:40.600
So organisms do this,

55:41.600 --> 55:43.600
and the question is how does it get off the ground?

55:44.600 --> 55:49.600
And next time we can at least speculate

55:50.600 --> 55:54.600
about that kind of origin of life type of question

55:55.600 --> 55:57.600
in the context of the FEP

55:58.600 --> 56:03.600
and its realization in simple systems of communicating observers.

56:04.600 --> 56:10.600
So as always, I encourage you to use the interactive Q&A.

56:11.600 --> 56:14.600
The fifth discussion session with Andrew,

56:15.600 --> 56:16.600
who's unfortunately not here today,

56:17.600 --> 56:19.600
will be the last day of September,

56:20.600 --> 56:22.600
Saturday at five as usual,

56:23.600 --> 56:24.600
five o'clock European time,

56:25.600 --> 56:26.600
eight o'clock California time.

56:27.600 --> 56:28.600
And then the last session of the class

56:29.600 --> 56:30.600
will be the 12th of October.

56:30.600 --> 56:34.600
So thank you very much.

56:35.600 --> 56:36.600
And I look forward to your questions

56:37.600 --> 56:38.600
in the interactive Q&A.

56:48.600 --> 56:49.600
Thank you, Chris.

56:50.600 --> 56:51.600
Can I ask you some short questions?

56:52.600 --> 56:53.600
Sure.

56:54.600 --> 56:55.600
All right.

56:56.600 --> 56:57.600
So first from Lana wrote,

56:57.600 --> 57:00.600
is the periodicity the time lengths between

57:01.600 --> 57:03.600
and during the excitations built in?

57:04.600 --> 57:06.600
So this was when we had the four cells

57:07.600 --> 57:10.600
and there was the inklings of a clock coming into play.

57:21.600 --> 57:24.600
I think the simplest answer is that

57:27.600 --> 57:31.600
if nothing else is happening in the environment

57:32.600 --> 57:34.600
except this periodic behavior,

57:35.600 --> 57:43.600
then it's not actually meaningful to talk yet

57:44.600 --> 57:46.600
about the time between the events.

57:48.600 --> 57:56.600
So if I have a periodic, a system that's quasi periodic,

57:57.600 --> 58:04.600
for example, and nothing else is going on in my environment,

58:05.600 --> 58:09.600
then I can't distinguish that from a perfectly periodic system

58:10.600 --> 58:13.600
because I would have to have a perfectly periodic reference

58:14.600 --> 58:17.600
to know that the other system was a periodic.

58:18.600 --> 58:21.600
And if you think about the internal clock

58:22.600 --> 58:27.600
being driven by information flow into the system,

58:28.600 --> 58:31.600
then something has to be happening in the environment

58:32.600 --> 58:34.600
for information to be flowing into the system

58:35.600 --> 58:36.600
and being counted.

58:37.600 --> 58:41.600
So again, as we talked about a few sessions ago,

58:42.600 --> 58:46.600
the internal memory only gets updated when something happens.

58:47.600 --> 58:52.600
So internal and external get tied together.

58:53.600 --> 58:56.600
And this is why we can use external clocks.

58:58.600 --> 59:02.600
But it's also why we depend on external clocks

59:03.600 --> 59:09.600
because our intuitive sense of time is very malleable.

59:10.600 --> 59:16.600
And so we actually, as humans, use external clocks

59:17.600 --> 59:23.600
to correct for the malleability of our own intuitive sense of time.

59:25.600 --> 59:26.600
Wow.

59:27.600 --> 59:30.600
And there's probably a lot to be said for that procrustian nature

59:31.600 --> 59:34.600
of having the conometer, the clock on the wall,

59:35.600 --> 59:40.600
and the tick, tick, tick as an evolutionarily novel ruler

59:41.600 --> 59:47.600
of time playing a logistical role in time-bound society.

59:49.600 --> 59:50.600
Yeah.

59:51.600 --> 59:54.600
And think of earlier clocks that earlier cultures have used

59:55.600 --> 59:56.600
and that animals use.

59:57.600 --> 59:59.600
I mean, we have the solar clock, the lunar clock, et cetera.

01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:05.600
And the orbit of Venus clock that was so important to the Mayans

01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:07.600
and so on.

01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:11.600
So there are lots of available clocks in the environment

01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:14.600
if you have the ability to notice them

01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:18.600
and enough memory to realize that they're clocks.

01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:21.600
Awesome.

01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:24.600
All right, here's a question from Upcycle Club.

01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:28.600
They wrote, how does representing the network structure

01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:33.600
and dynamics with quantum embeddings affect the semantic interpretation

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:35.600
of the network?

01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:47.600
The embedding theory is the simplest semantic interpretation

01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:49.600
of the network.

01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:51.600
So...

01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:03.600
And again, a good way to think of this is through the lens

01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:05.600
of computer science.

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:12.600
As soon as you have a programming language that allows variable binding,

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:18.600
then you've built a very simple kind of semantics into the language.

01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:25.600
If you have X as a variable and you have variable binding,

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:31.600
then at different times in the execution of the program,

01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:36.600
X can have different causal consequences

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:38.600
for downstream computation

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:41.600
because it's been bound to a different value.

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:44.600
So it has different semantics.

01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:52.600
So the semantics of X, again, go back to Gregory Bateson.

01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:58.600
The basis of semantics is differences that make a difference,

01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:00.600
make a difference to behavior,

01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:02.600
make a difference to actionability.

01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:09.600
So variable binding gives you differences that actually make a difference

01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:11.600
to what the program does.

01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:17.600
So what is that?

01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:24.600
That is the semantics that's assigned by your embedding theory

01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:28.600
between what the programming language is doing

01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:31.600
and what the operating system is doing and so forth.

01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:40.600
And I think it's no surprise that the semantics of programming languages

01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:47.600
end up being represented with these very general mathematical constructs

01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:49.600
like category theory,

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:59.600
which are essentially tools for representing arbitrary relations

01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:01.600
between systems.

01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:05.600
And that's what embedding theories are.

01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:11.600
They're theories that state relationships between systems.

01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:16.600
Awesome.

01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:22.600
And very provocative to explore on the biological and life

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:25.600
and on the spacetime and matter sides,

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:31.600
which are, of course, seamlessly integrated through,

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:33.600
if only our own experiences.

01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:38.600
Yeah, this is another place where it's useful to go back to this

01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:43.600
difference between reductive theories and scale-free theories.

01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:46.600
And scale-free theories are all about semantics

01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:52.600
because they represent the existence of stuff happening at different scales

01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:58.600
and so they naturally raise the question of what are these relationships?

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:01.600
What are these embedding theories?

01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:09.600
And in reductive theories, there's a very deep sense in which semantics doesn't matter.

01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:17.600
If you think that all that's going on that's important

01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:20.600
is the stuff that's going on at the Planck scale,

01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:25.600
then you don't need any semantics, right?

01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:38.600
And so you see this in late 60s, early 70s, old-fashioned AI,

01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:46.600
where people talk about computation as purely syntactic.

01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:49.600
And this is a very reductionist view of computation

01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:51.600
without the semantics.

01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:55.600
And without the semantics, the computation is useless.

01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:59.600
It doesn't tell us anything at all unless we can map it to something.

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:08.600
So we have this philosophy of science tradition

01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:11.600
that tells us that semantics is not important.

01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:16.600
And we end up with tools like the FEP

01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:20.600
that essentially tell us that semantics is all important.

01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:25.600
And from a biological point of view,

01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:31.600
the most natural response is, of course, we knew that all the time.

01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:33.600
That's why we're doing biology.

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:39.600
So all of this ties together.

01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:44.600
Would you say that FEP says semantics is important

01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:48.600
and then what does it say about what semantics are important

01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:51.600
or is that entirely left up to the modular?

01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:58.600
Well, it tells you a lot about what's important

01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:02.600
for the system itself, right?

01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:05.600
The system itself is dealing with its environment

01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:12.600
and it's trying to increase its predictive power.

01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:16.600
So it's building a theory of the environment

01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:21.600
and that theory is intrinsically semantic, right?

01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:25.600
It's about the environment and it's actionable.

01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:32.600
The theory is meant to drive action on the environment

01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:36.600
that will either yield more information

01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:42.600
or get the environment to behave

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:46.600
to do what I'm predicting it's going to do.

01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:53.600
So I think the FEP is intrinsically semantic

01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:57.600
in that sense that it's about an agent modeling its environment.

01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:01.600
Yes, and about the semantics of action

01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:07.600
as opposed to a partial or limited semantics

01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:11.600
of passive inferiors or semantics of abstraction

01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:17.600
which leaves the important link between the agent

01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:21.600
and the environment through sense making and decision selection

01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:24.600
basically unaddressed because it's kind of

01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:26.600
in the thought experiment in the room

01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:29.600
and here when we actually engage with the boundary of the room

01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:31.600
that's where we start.

01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:38.600
Yeah, the FEP completely destroys this classical notion

01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:44.600
of the passive observer as does quantum theory.

01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:47.600
There are no passive observers in quantum theory.

01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:51.600
So this is a construct that we inherited

01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:57.600
from a classical worldview that is seriously misleading.

01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:06.600
There's a lot more to say but that's a great place to end.

01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:08.600
Thank you, Chris.

01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:13.600
Okay, thank you, Daniel and thanks to you all and ask questions.

01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:15.600
See you next time.

01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:17.600
We'll see you next time.

01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:31.600
Thank you.
