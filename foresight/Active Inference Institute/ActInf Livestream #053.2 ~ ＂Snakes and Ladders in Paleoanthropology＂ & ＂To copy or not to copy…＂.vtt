WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.120
to copy or not to copy. That is the question from chimpanzees to the foundation of human

00:05.120 --> 00:13.200
technological culture, recently appeared in physics of life reviews. Let me see if this works. Yeah,

00:13.200 --> 00:20.960
sorry. So it all starts with a jigsaw puzzle. And the puzzle is why a highly innovative species

00:20.960 --> 00:27.040
like chimpanzees do not live in a complex technological world. So we know chimpanzees are

00:27.040 --> 00:32.400
very inventive. They are very creative. They are insightful. They can learn socially.

00:33.440 --> 00:41.120
But what we don't see in the same extent or similar extent we see in humans is the accumulation

00:41.120 --> 00:46.720
of complexity across generations. So you can see here in these images, we have one of the more

00:46.720 --> 00:52.800
complex and demanding tasks that chimpanzees perform, cracking nuts open, and they can combine

00:52.800 --> 00:57.920
different tools. They can use it in the appropriate order. So this means they are very insightful.

00:58.560 --> 01:04.400
And yet, if we compare it with a rocket that can bring civilization to Mars,

01:05.840 --> 01:10.960
it is clear that the accumulation of technology across generation works very differently in humans

01:10.960 --> 01:19.520
and other non-human species. So the basic question or the one million dollar question is why does

01:19.600 --> 01:24.720
innovation fail to translate into technological cumulative complexity in chimpanzees?

01:25.840 --> 01:31.040
Does it owe to a limited capacity to copy with fidelity? Or what we referred

01:31.840 --> 01:37.040
as true imitation, which means reproducing not only the end result that would be emulating

01:37.040 --> 01:42.720
or emulation, but also the steps that lead to that end result. So according to this view,

01:43.360 --> 01:49.680
further to copy innovation with faithful accuracy, hampers their intra and intergenerational spread,

01:49.680 --> 01:55.680
and any ensuing ratcheting up effects. So possibly when copying with fidelity is impeded,

01:55.680 --> 02:01.040
innovative performances are unlikely to lift their protagonist. And this brings us back to the

02:01.040 --> 02:06.800
discussion we had the other day in The Snakes and Others paper where we said that after two

02:06.800 --> 02:14.960
million years ago, Iriomo produced these almond-shamed bifacili flaked stones. But these

02:16.160 --> 02:22.880
kind of artifacts that we don't even dare to call them tools were not copied by

02:22.880 --> 02:28.240
conspecific observers because perhaps they were not attributing to them any kind of functional

02:28.240 --> 02:36.240
use. So perhaps they were not seen as tools and were the result of manual inactions.

02:36.880 --> 02:46.080
So to ratchet up complexity, it is important that inventions, that is tools, are copied with

02:46.080 --> 02:50.800
sufficient fidelity so that they retain the fundamental features or attributes that make

02:50.800 --> 02:55.920
them functional. So following the steps of demonstrated tool manufactured by an expert

02:55.920 --> 03:02.320
model to the letter is the simplest, fastest and cheapest way to make sure that copies of the

03:02.320 --> 03:10.640
original artifact are accurate. And here cheapest we refer to in terms of expenditure of energy.

03:11.600 --> 03:17.680
So if the copies are functional, hence useful, they keep circulating in the group community

03:17.680 --> 03:23.760
longer. And these skills increase the opportunities for one or more individuals different from the

03:23.760 --> 03:30.160
original inventor to add in complexity. So for example, one individual invents a wooden spur

03:30.240 --> 03:37.200
and 100 years later the smelting of copper is discovered and another individual adds to it

03:37.200 --> 03:40.480
to this spur a sharp copper point and so on.

03:43.360 --> 03:50.640
So here is an interesting concept of ratchet effect that would explain in part why humans

03:50.640 --> 03:56.880
have built such complex cultural and technological work. So the idea of the ratchet effect is that

03:56.880 --> 04:02.480
no generation starts from scratch. Instead, inventions and cultural products created by

04:02.480 --> 04:08.480
one generation are kept in mind and transmitted to the next generation. This way, every generation

04:08.480 --> 04:14.560
is better off supposedly than the one that preceded it. So here we can think of books,

04:14.560 --> 04:22.480
books are a wonderful way of keeping information, sharing it across generations and among the same

04:22.480 --> 04:29.120
generation also. So thus technological complexity and success in humans is not dependent solely

04:29.120 --> 04:34.960
on the geniality of one or few individuals. It is a joint endeavor where many individuals

04:34.960 --> 04:40.400
contributed specific expertise and skills to produce increasingly complex artifacts.

04:40.960 --> 04:48.080
And again, we can think in establishing a colony in Mars, no single human alive could achieve that

04:48.080 --> 04:53.760
alone or we have the required expertise to achieve that alone, but all together we can

04:53.760 --> 05:00.640
perhaps manage that. So we need this kind of shared knowledge and accumulated accretion of course.

05:03.440 --> 05:11.120
So why it is some behaviors or innovation are copied or not can be explained at the level of

05:11.120 --> 05:17.120
social dynamics but also at the level of the brain or giving a more mechanistic explanation.

05:17.200 --> 05:21.520
So explanation of why coping of certain behavior in chimpanzees does not occur with frequency

05:21.520 --> 05:26.880
have been often kept at the level of social dynamics where factors such as social prestige,

05:26.880 --> 05:33.040
dominance, etc. are said to be key to explaining whether or not an invention is adopted by observers.

05:33.920 --> 05:38.480
And this is a problem against the brain to a subsidiary role. Here, Michael and I will

05:38.480 --> 05:44.000
be attempting to identify what the minimum cognitive requirements are that can give rise

05:44.000 --> 05:50.720
to innovations and their horizontal and vertical transmission. And we also attempted to differentiate

05:50.720 --> 05:56.960
the cognitive ingredients necessary for innovation from those that need to be in place for the adoption

05:56.960 --> 06:02.080
of an innovation. So we wanted to establish a clear demarcation between the brains of the

06:03.120 --> 06:07.840
ones that innovate and the brains of those who observe an innovation because we think this

06:07.920 --> 06:15.760
is important to be analyzed separately. So in order to see which are the mechanisms

06:16.640 --> 06:21.680
at the level of the brain that would allow for one innovation to be copied, we invoked

06:21.680 --> 06:28.480
the lens of the free energy principle. According to active inference under the free energy principle,

06:28.480 --> 06:34.000
it is through there being limited to a certain number of states that is the attracting set

06:34.000 --> 06:40.080
that organisms minimize the variational free energy of the internal states and resist entropic

06:40.080 --> 06:46.320
dissipation. Minimizing variation of free energy reduces prediction sensation discrepancies,

06:47.040 --> 06:52.240
prediction errors that can be corrected by active sampling of predicted sensory inputs

06:52.240 --> 06:57.760
and perceptive modification of predictions. This is sometimes expressed in terms of perceptual

06:57.760 --> 07:04.320
inference that is changing predictions to mad sensations and active inference reactively

07:04.320 --> 07:14.480
changing sensations to match predictions. So innovation in a way might represent a potential

07:14.480 --> 07:19.680
misfireings from a Darwinian perspective. So minimizing variational free energy can be achieved

07:19.680 --> 07:24.560
through action, sending creatures can act, active inference in order to fulfill their predictions

07:24.560 --> 07:28.480
and thereby reduce discrepancy between the latter and sample reality.

07:29.600 --> 07:34.960
Being limited to a certain number of states, what we could refer to as the attracting set,

07:34.960 --> 07:41.200
is therefore synonymous with minimizing variational free energy and hence maximizing adaptive fitness.

07:42.640 --> 07:48.080
Here innovation represents an anomaly and innovators are unorthodox actors or protagonists

07:48.080 --> 07:54.000
who entertain new courses of action or plans. New phenotypical responses that have not been

07:54.000 --> 07:59.760
previously entertained and according to this interpretation of the free energy principle,

07:59.760 --> 08:03.680
it is at the level of policy selection where innovators stand apart from the crowd.

08:04.480 --> 08:10.000
Their policy selection is in a sense faulty insofar as their ensuing behavioral outcomes are

08:10.000 --> 08:16.080
in more contrast to those of their fellow actors who deploy orthodox responses that reduce discrepancies

08:16.080 --> 08:21.600
between predictions and sensations thereby reducing the prediction error. Here when we talk

08:21.600 --> 08:27.120
of misfireings, we don't do it in a kind of negative sense, it's just to express that

08:27.840 --> 08:32.800
these new behaviors, these innovations necessarily will produce more surprise.

08:35.920 --> 08:43.360
Okay, seeing surprising things, with this phrase I am kind of paraphrasing Andy Clark

08:43.360 --> 08:49.360
in a paper in Behavioral and Brain Sciences. He referred to seeing surprising things to being

08:49.360 --> 08:55.040
able to lend credibility to the sensory information that is not in accordance to prior beliefs.

08:56.160 --> 09:01.520
So the family of priority density is entertained by an individual irrestricted to the systems,

09:01.520 --> 09:07.200
the brains prior by some beliefs. Equivalent, roughly speaking, to its phenotypical repertoire.

09:08.080 --> 09:14.000
This means by definition that innovative behaviors both are likely to be missed in any given phenotype

09:14.080 --> 09:18.080
and, crucially, difficult to recognize when observed by another.

09:19.600 --> 09:25.040
Should an innovator's behavior diverge markedly from the repertoire of plausible policies used

09:25.040 --> 09:30.720
usually by an observer to predict another's behavior, it may be beyond the capacity of

09:30.720 --> 09:37.760
the latter's generative model to recognize it, that is, to make sense of it. So large discrepancies

09:37.760 --> 09:44.240
pose a threat to the brain, because one, updating involves making energetic demands, and two,

09:44.240 --> 09:49.840
risk-reducing adaptive fitness by inappropriately changing the generative models. And here we

09:49.840 --> 09:54.880
need to think that the generative model has been selected also in a specific economy, so changing

09:54.880 --> 10:04.720
it might have risks. Okay. So what is required for a brain to entertain generative models that

10:04.720 --> 10:11.600
involve unusual or bizarre behaviors? The hierarchical predictive interpretation of the brain,

10:11.600 --> 10:18.080
or hierarchically mechanistic mind, an amphibious inference machine, sorry, implies that each level

10:18.080 --> 10:23.280
of the hierarchy of cerebral neuronal circuits conveys predictions or conditional expectations

10:23.280 --> 10:28.960
that suppress errors at the level below, while concurrently conveying errors that permit the

10:28.960 --> 10:36.080
revision of the expectations at the level above. Possibly, dynamical precision weighting enables

10:36.080 --> 10:41.600
the system, that is, the brain, to readjust the confidence afforded to top-down expectations

10:41.600 --> 10:47.840
as opposed to bottom-up prediction errors. In other words, in order to entertain a prior

10:47.840 --> 10:53.760
data and likely hypothesis might explain best some behavior within us, it is first necessary to

10:53.760 --> 10:59.200
relax the precision or commitment to prior beliefs, thus enabling new or implausible

10:59.200 --> 11:08.400
hypotheses to explain novel behavior. And here I introduce some things we discussed the other day,

11:08.400 --> 11:12.480
Professor Freiston talk of attenuation of sensory information in relation to

11:12.480 --> 11:18.560
saccades, which is kind of switching off the sensory information we are being aware of,

11:19.200 --> 11:27.680
and that would be the opposite as being impressionable. So I'm quoting Professor Freiston here.

11:28.480 --> 11:34.240
If I can copy, that means I am impressionable. I will accumulate new evidence very quickly.

11:34.240 --> 11:39.280
I have the capacity to assign greater evidence or precision to sensory evidence and suspend

11:39.280 --> 11:46.480
the precision to my prior beliefs. This is something he mentioned in the last

11:47.280 --> 11:55.760
active inference recording, 53.1. And to end this introduction,

11:56.800 --> 12:01.920
one concept we introduced in our paper, which is central to our discussion, is that of zones

12:01.920 --> 12:07.280
of bandwidth surprise. So this is a new concept we introduced to refer to the levels of mismatch

12:07.280 --> 12:14.000
between prior beliefs or top-down predictions and sensory information that species can tolerate.

12:14.640 --> 12:21.440
So first and foremost, the focus of the ZBS concept is on the observers and their ability

12:21.440 --> 12:28.320
to make sense of unobserved innovation. Encoding and subsequent copying of innovation depends

12:28.320 --> 12:33.440
on the degree of disparity or surprise between predictable behaviors, namely,

12:33.440 --> 12:38.640
those typical of the species, and the perceptual incoming information about novel behaviors.

12:39.520 --> 12:45.040
If the ZBS is right, it means that the species can give credit to the information received

12:45.040 --> 12:51.120
through its senses that challenges the prior beliefs. In short, as species can register and

12:51.120 --> 12:56.080
code and potentially reproduce innovative behavior of certain code specifics that

12:56.080 --> 13:02.720
deviate markedly from customary prototypical behaviors. The species is highly impressionable

13:02.720 --> 13:08.960
if we use the words that Professor Friston used the other day. So if the ZBS is narrow,

13:08.960 --> 13:13.920
then a species' ability to change prior beliefs to accommodate new evidence regarding

13:13.920 --> 13:21.840
innovative practices of serving code specifics is compromised. I just want to end up and avoid

13:21.840 --> 13:26.640
any kind of misunderstanding. I want to make clear that our zone of bandwidth surprises have

13:26.640 --> 13:33.680
nothing to do with the zone of Latin solutions by Tenie, albeit we are discussing similar topics.

13:33.680 --> 13:41.520
So the zone of Latin solutions that was introduced by Tenie Kai and Tomo Aselo refers to solutions

13:41.520 --> 13:47.920
to a problem, for instance, extractive foraging that can be achieved by an individual in isolation

13:47.920 --> 13:53.600
during his or her lifetime and hence is not likely to be the product of cumulative culture

13:53.680 --> 13:59.120
involving social learning when observed in the wild. And for those readers interested in this

13:59.120 --> 14:09.360
concept, they can go to the original paper I'm showing here. And also there is a recent paper

14:09.360 --> 14:18.880
by Andrew Whiten, who is Professor in St. Andrews, that discusses this concept and that has replication

14:18.880 --> 14:24.720
by other authors. So it might be a good update for those interested also. And with that, I

14:24.720 --> 14:33.120
finish this short presentation and we can enter this question. Let me stop sharing the screen. Okay, now.

14:35.120 --> 14:43.120
Thank you, Hector. I will bring up the notes again and to Michael, Carl or Dean,

14:43.120 --> 14:45.680
whomever would like to provide a first response, please.

14:54.960 --> 14:59.360
Well, I don't really have a great deal more to add. I think

15:03.280 --> 15:09.920
Hello. Yes, please continue. What's happened here? You're all good, Michael.

15:10.640 --> 15:17.120
We're here, Michael. Hello. Can you hear me? Yes, we hear you continue. Yes, we can. I'm not quite

15:17.120 --> 15:24.880
sure what's happened here. We seem to have snakes and ladders up on the screen. As I said, I don't

15:24.880 --> 15:31.200
think I can add much more to what Hector has just said. I think it makes a very succinct

15:31.840 --> 15:42.720
summary of our paper. And I would like to certainly congratulate Hector for making

15:43.680 --> 15:51.520
what seems to me a very original and perceptive observation that it is the observers whom we

15:51.520 --> 16:01.600
have to thank for the copying and therefore for the handing down of technological achievements by

16:01.600 --> 16:11.280
early humans. Whereas too often the emphasis has been made on the personal responsible for making

16:11.280 --> 16:18.960
a technological innovation. But of course, unless somebody copies that, or at least unless it registers

16:18.960 --> 16:24.720
in the mind of somebody else, it is unlikely ever to get copied. And although this seems to be a fairly

16:25.760 --> 16:33.360
obvious observation, it seems to have escaped most of those who have published on the matter

16:33.360 --> 16:39.600
either too. And I think this is a very original contribution on Hector's part, which deserves

16:39.600 --> 16:47.680
to be complimented. And really, that's all I wish to say. I think I'd like to throw this open to

16:47.680 --> 16:55.600
other people. And if I can illuminate or elucidate any matters, I'm happy to do so. But I think

16:55.600 --> 17:03.280
this is really very much to put it mildly Hector's brainchild. And congratulations.

17:06.080 --> 17:11.840
Thanks, Michael. You're very kind, but this is our child. And you know a lot. You have a lot to

17:11.840 --> 17:17.280
contribute. So I mean, I can only learn school. But thank you anyway.

17:20.640 --> 17:23.360
Awesome. Carl or Dean?

17:27.200 --> 17:27.920
Go ahead, Carl.

17:30.800 --> 17:40.160
Right. So I just wanted to reiterate Michael's admiration for both the idea, but also the very

17:40.160 --> 17:50.400
fluent and clear articulation of it. It was nice for me to see that presented so succinctly,

17:50.400 --> 17:57.680
because the clarity of the idea is really very evident. It struck me there are sort of two

17:58.640 --> 18:09.600
themes that we could discuss, which is the emergence of more complicated solutions to

18:09.600 --> 18:14.800
accurately engaging with and modeling our world. I think that was sort of a generic theme in the

18:14.800 --> 18:19.040
first part of the presentation. But then very quickly, we moved to this kernel idea, this core

18:19.040 --> 18:31.600
idea that the dissemination and the transgenerational propagation that could be read as some kind of

18:32.480 --> 18:38.080
cultural niche construction in a sort of evo-devo context depends upon being able to recognize

18:38.640 --> 18:46.640
a particular behavior and thereby copy and imitate. I think that was the key thing. And for me,

18:46.640 --> 18:56.160
just understanding the mechanics of that from the point of view of belief updating and active

18:56.160 --> 19:08.320
inference was, I think, a really useful thing. And as Hector beautifully articulated, the ability

19:08.800 --> 19:17.360
to recognize something new and update one's generative model or posterior beliefs depends

19:17.360 --> 19:24.000
very sensitively on the confidence or the precision that you've described, the sense of evidence,

19:24.000 --> 19:30.640
in relation to the precision with which you hold your prior belief. And I think that's

19:30.640 --> 19:40.000
absolutely crucial. And I sort of highlight that issue because it is exactly the same issue

19:40.720 --> 19:46.800
that you will find when applying active inference and the free energy principle to

19:48.160 --> 19:52.880
psychiatry and the different ways in which we can... I can't remember, Hector, what was your

19:52.880 --> 19:59.120
word, misfire, in neither a good nor a bad sense, but certainly there are certain psychiatric

20:00.080 --> 20:05.120
syndromes that could be regarded as misfiring. And of course, there's a very close association

20:05.120 --> 20:12.560
with innovation and creativity and manic depressive psychosis, famed in terms of various

20:12.560 --> 20:22.640
historical figures in the arts. And that, I think, again, brings us back to this key notion

20:23.440 --> 20:30.880
of getting that balance, the balance of the precision of our prior constructs,

20:30.880 --> 20:36.960
what we have accrued through experience-dependent learning, and the precision-afforded evidence

20:36.960 --> 20:41.200
that this is how the world is actually working and how I am actually working, getting that balance

20:41.200 --> 20:47.760
right. And that's a really difficult job. And sometimes in computational psychiatry,

20:47.840 --> 20:55.040
we try to explain this in terms of a statistician. In order to get the balance right, you have to

20:55.040 --> 21:01.520
be able to estimate these precisions in exactly the same spirit that a statistician, when making

21:01.520 --> 21:06.880
an inference doing a t-test, has to estimate not just the difference in the group means,

21:06.880 --> 21:11.920
but also the standard error. And it's often much more difficult to estimate the standard error

21:12.800 --> 21:18.960
than it is to estimate the difference in the group means. And that standard error is the

21:18.960 --> 21:25.200
inverse precision. It's the weight that you afford, the meaning, the significance of some

21:25.200 --> 21:32.080
quantitative difference, say, a prediction error. So you see this theme that there are two parts to

21:32.080 --> 21:38.000
inference. The first order part is just the prediction error or the surprise. But then

21:38.640 --> 21:44.160
you have to assign how newsworthy is that. You have to actually modulate that

21:44.160 --> 21:48.720
with its precision. So you can multiply by the precision or divide by the standard error

21:48.720 --> 21:55.200
to get the actual thing that matters that's going to change your mind. And there's a whole

21:55.200 --> 22:04.320
literature on different kinds of people in the context of neurodiversity that have an impairment

22:04.400 --> 22:09.520
in being able or possibly have an impairment in being able to estimate that precision. And

22:09.520 --> 22:16.400
I'm thinking here of the poster child of this kind of formulation, which is autism. And the idea

22:17.120 --> 22:25.120
being that there is an early developmental failure to attenuate sensory precision. So they are

22:26.080 --> 22:36.160
early and continually during their early development, severe autism, unable to ignore

22:36.160 --> 22:43.600
any of their sensations. And as a consequence, everything is surprising. Everything's arousing.

22:43.600 --> 22:50.560
Everything is in danger of revising any beliefs very, very quickly. So they're highly impressionable

22:50.560 --> 22:57.120
to the extent they can't build deeply coherent models of their lived world or indeed the other

22:57.680 --> 23:05.440
artifacts such as mum that constitutes their world. So I'm just wondering whether a species

23:07.280 --> 23:14.720
that has the same kind of latitude in terms of either biasing attention or precision

23:14.720 --> 23:20.960
to sensory evidence versus accumulated prior beliefs would display the same kind of misfiring.

23:20.960 --> 23:26.480
So you can go from one end and autistic species will be overly impressionable.

23:26.480 --> 23:31.440
It'll be too evolvable. It will be able to remember anything from generation to generation.

23:32.000 --> 23:39.600
The converse is somebody who you can imagine from a psychiatric perspective

23:39.760 --> 23:46.880
has committed unduly to very precise prior beliefs about the world works. And you can think of this

23:46.880 --> 23:52.960
in terms of compulsive obsessional disorder or perhaps even depression. The world is an awful

23:52.960 --> 23:59.040
place. That is true. Therefore, there's no point in going out and challenging the evidence that the

23:59.040 --> 24:07.280
world is an awful place. So I'm just going to stay inside and feel isolated and not move or say very

24:07.280 --> 24:12.560
much. So that would be an example of who somebody is not very impressionable. In fact,

24:12.560 --> 24:18.320
their pathology, their misfiring prevents them from acquiring any evidence to revise those beliefs.

24:18.320 --> 24:25.280
So if you imagine a species that had that same kind of second order misfiring,

24:26.160 --> 24:32.320
this is not the misfiring of the innovative soul. This is a failure to infer the second

24:32.320 --> 24:38.960
order cystics, the reliability, the precision, the variance, the entropy of the content of the

24:38.960 --> 24:47.760
things they try to innovate or make sense of. You're left with this notion of a species that

24:47.760 --> 24:56.560
just cannot respond to selective pressures for selectability. They can't respond by adjusting

24:56.560 --> 25:01.360
their evolvability simply because they're fixed in their way. So for the environmental,

25:01.360 --> 25:07.440
economic changes in any fundamental way, they're not going to be able to respond to that.

25:08.320 --> 25:18.560
So I think there are many examples of this key. I think it would be called a pathology in the

25:18.560 --> 25:26.080
sense that in a volatile environment, you would need to optimize the precision afforded sensory

25:26.080 --> 25:31.120
evidence in order to make the best sense and understand and engage with that environment.

25:31.120 --> 25:36.880
And if you get that wrong, there will be a pathology. And I think basically Hector's

25:38.240 --> 25:46.560
formulation really drills down and really focuses on the actual mechanism of this kind of pathology.

25:46.560 --> 25:52.960
It's all about the transcultural spread of generative models and sense making

25:53.920 --> 25:59.120
in terms of engaging either with artifacts or indeed with conspecifics.

26:00.160 --> 26:08.080
I repeat, it's such an easy thing to get wrong as evinced in psychiatry. There are so many instances

26:08.080 --> 26:18.160
of neurodiversity expressed clinically that I think reflects this singular dimension in terms

26:18.160 --> 26:24.640
of the ability to get that balance right. I remember we discussed last time again in terms of

26:24.640 --> 26:30.160
impressionability and selection for selectability and the like, the same kind of mechanism unfolding

26:31.600 --> 26:38.000
in terms of evolutionary mechanics. But at the level that I think we're talking about today

26:38.000 --> 26:46.800
in terms of pursuing plans and novel ways of doing things that may or may not be

26:47.680 --> 26:56.240
recognized due to a failure or not of being able to suspend the precision of your priorities.

26:56.240 --> 27:02.640
I think that was a central theme. I'll just close with an interesting comment that

27:03.440 --> 27:08.960
in terms of the kind of misfiring that Hector was implying, basically a novel way of doing things,

27:10.400 --> 27:15.360
being the unique province of those kinds of creatures that can plan possibly deeper into the

27:15.360 --> 27:21.760
future. There's a really interesting sort of link back to this precision notion

27:22.560 --> 27:30.640
in the sense that if you try to simulate the depth of planning of any sentient artifact,

27:32.400 --> 27:38.080
then the degree to which they are able to look into the future depends upon the precision

27:38.080 --> 27:44.160
of their beliefs about the succession of contingencies. What will happen if this happens

27:44.160 --> 27:50.480
and then what will happen if that happens? It's technically the precision of the transitions

27:50.480 --> 27:56.480
amongst worldly states of affairs as you roll out into the future. Again, you have to estimate

27:56.480 --> 28:04.320
that precision. There's another point at which precision gets into the game, but in this instance,

28:04.320 --> 28:12.000
it's not the precision of the sensory evidence, but the prior precision about the ways things

28:12.000 --> 28:18.320
unfold and what will happen if I do that. If you have a low precision there, then you don't

28:18.320 --> 28:22.960
hang very far into the future because you lose certainty and confidence very, very quickly

28:22.960 --> 28:30.640
after just a few moves. Whereas if you have very precise beliefs about the state transitions and

28:30.640 --> 28:37.040
the consequences of various actions or sequential policies, then you can roll out confidently much

28:37.040 --> 28:44.320
further into the future and perhaps find that innovative solution. Again, you come back mechanistically

28:44.320 --> 28:55.120
to phenotypes that have differing degrees of precision. In this instance, get into the game

28:55.120 --> 29:06.720
in terms of bounding the depth of the planning or the temple horizons that you can entertain

29:06.720 --> 29:13.760
when scoring different plans in order to actually select the best action at the moment.

29:15.360 --> 29:21.440
For me, that insight is really useful because I can see how one could simulate that quite easily

29:21.440 --> 29:29.760
in toy situations. Those are my thoughts inspired by Hector's excellent presentation.

29:30.160 --> 29:36.960
Thank you, Carl. Dean, what say you?

29:39.680 --> 29:50.240
Well, if it's okay, I'd like to step back for a second. Because we were privileged to be able

29:50.240 --> 29:57.360
to look at the two papers almost simultaneously, I know chronologically we've split it up into

29:57.360 --> 30:04.080
weeks, but as readers we were able to kind of look at both papers side by each. I kind of want

30:04.080 --> 30:10.800
to take a bit of a Hofstetter strange loop, two-sided condition, Mobius. We've got all those

30:10.800 --> 30:18.080
representations in a lot of our live stream introductions. So if we were to assume that

30:18.080 --> 30:24.480
because Carl pointed out not everybody can accommodate a two things at once perspective,

30:24.800 --> 30:31.520
if we can assume that that doesn't overwhelm, my question to the authors is, do they see their

30:31.520 --> 30:43.200
own journey as a one paper or artifact morphing into the next, or as we were pulled out and taken

30:43.200 --> 30:49.120
up by this relationship between epistemic and pragmatic values when uptaking an active inference

30:49.200 --> 30:56.400
perspective? That's part one of the question. Part two is the former is kind of a sequential

30:56.400 --> 31:02.960
mechanical technical side of things. The latter is the combinatorial plus meaning entailed and

31:02.960 --> 31:12.320
entangled. So more where am I relative? So combined, that's a relative depth of field

31:12.320 --> 31:19.840
as setting, as establishing, morphing, we want to call it that. As active inference strategy

31:19.840 --> 31:26.560
is applied, how do the authors see or potentially see this perspective combining, meaning the

31:26.560 --> 31:33.120
sequential end of the combinatorial affecting, not effecting, but affecting what we believe?

31:35.200 --> 31:40.640
Because I'm a big believer that we can't just sort of strip the feelings part of this out. I think

31:40.640 --> 31:46.880
that's whether we're talking chimpanzees or whether we're talking the emotions of sliding down a snake,

31:47.680 --> 31:52.480
those are part of this thing that we're looking at.

31:56.080 --> 32:03.040
I'll just give one short note on that. In the paper, Sophisticated Affective Inference,

32:03.920 --> 32:12.560
they simulated counterfactual futures, projections about futures, which are in active inference,

32:13.360 --> 32:19.600
action oriented. All futures are analyzed and inferred about with respect to policy selection

32:19.600 --> 32:28.640
by the agent. And one of the patterns already apparent in even the simple simulations were that

32:29.120 --> 32:37.280
even if a very small fraction of counterfactuals have like death as an outcome or highly negative

32:37.280 --> 32:42.880
outcomes, it can increase the variance estimator on possible futures greatly,

32:43.600 --> 32:53.680
leading to essentially ruminative behavior and affective anxiety around the legitimately warranted

32:53.760 --> 33:01.760
variance in possible outcomes. So I see a key piece of this puzzle to be entertaining

33:01.760 --> 33:08.080
progressively wider time cones of possible futures in a prospective capacity,

33:10.000 --> 33:17.040
and entertaining progressively wider time cones in the past of causal mechanisms

33:17.440 --> 33:32.400
and somehow negotiating that affect barometer in the moment as the eye of the needle.

33:34.640 --> 33:42.080
Hector and Michael, where do you see affect coming into the snakes and ladders to copy

33:42.160 --> 33:52.400
or not to copy set? Well, may I make one or two comments? First of all, in addition to

33:53.040 --> 34:00.000
what Professor Fiston has told us about autism and so on, I think it's worth mentioning

34:00.800 --> 34:07.200
in the connection of the question that Daniel has just raised to say that there is clearly a

34:07.200 --> 34:16.560
difference in the evolution during the life cycle of early humans on the one hand and great apes

34:16.560 --> 34:25.200
and probably most human forerunners on the other, the extension of the human life cycle,

34:26.000 --> 34:31.120
the extension beyond childhood, and in particular, as I mentioned last time,

34:31.120 --> 34:40.240
the adolescent growth spur to which we have, but which may not have existed in early hormone

34:40.960 --> 34:49.520
even one and a half million years ago, I'm sure is relevant to making the evolutionary

34:50.320 --> 35:01.680
step between, let us say, the surprise that perhaps a chimpanzee has if she

35:03.280 --> 35:10.160
observes a dead bird and then regards this as counterintuitive because birds ought not

35:10.160 --> 35:17.920
to be lying on the ground, throws it up into the air, but this is an individual spontaneous

35:18.720 --> 35:25.440
reaction which is not handed on as part of a behavioral repertoire of the species.

35:26.880 --> 35:35.360
And on the other hand, when we begin to see the reproduction of, as it were, counterintuitive

35:36.320 --> 35:44.640
behavioral sequences such as taking a lot of flakes repetitively by hand from a piece of stone

35:44.640 --> 35:53.360
using another stone to produce an almond-shaped hand axe fairly regularly flaked on both sides,

35:54.000 --> 36:01.440
something which is not found before Homo appears in the archaeological and paleoantribological

36:01.440 --> 36:09.520
record, but which is not something that seems to be a regular part of human behavior. It is almost

36:09.520 --> 36:18.720
as if the individual who made that was doing it as a kind of spontaneous thought of what might

36:18.720 --> 36:26.880
happen if I was to do this, part of the deep generation of the hierarchically mechanistic

36:26.880 --> 36:34.560
mind which Professor Fiston has told us about, a deep generation that, however, may have been

36:34.560 --> 36:41.840
a misfiring, it may have been simply a personal spontaneous event which is not easily

36:43.120 --> 36:52.000
recognized by others, particularly if their, shall we say to put it mildly, their mental

36:53.360 --> 37:00.720
development is stunted due to the early adulthood and the lack of any adolescence.

37:00.720 --> 37:09.200
Adolescence in particular, which and of course the development of the neuronal

37:09.200 --> 37:14.800
architecture of the brain which in modern people continues until our mid-20s, if this was not to

37:14.800 --> 37:24.160
have occurred, as it does not of course in evening gray tapes, then there would have been perhaps

37:24.720 --> 37:32.320
a problem here about the deep generative potential of an individual ever being

37:33.760 --> 37:40.400
recognized such that it isn't just what might happen if I was to do this with a piece of stone,

37:40.400 --> 37:46.560
but what might happen if I was to copy what that other individual is doing with a piece of stone.

37:47.520 --> 37:55.760
And this I think is the stumbling block, this is what has led to the snakes and ladders picture,

37:55.760 --> 38:05.920
it is what I think has led to the very slow adaptation of technological, cumulative technological

38:08.080 --> 38:13.680
handing down from between generations or between individuals of a generation and between

38:13.760 --> 38:21.280
generations and it may well have been the case that it was not until demographical

38:23.040 --> 38:32.400
as well of course as paleobiological changes had evolved in the Guinness Homo that there was

38:32.400 --> 38:42.640
sufficient intercourse, not merely sexual but social such that these questions continue to be

38:43.680 --> 38:50.880
asked ever more frequently and with the appearance of better and ever more fluent communication

38:51.680 --> 39:02.160
would allow what we now regard as human culture specifically human nature which

39:03.280 --> 39:12.640
I think has differentiated us ever more from the gray tapes. I just, those are my thoughts on the

39:12.640 --> 39:21.600
matter. Thank you Michael, Tari or anyone else please.

39:25.760 --> 39:33.360
When I just speak to the question about affect and what Michael has just treated us to,

39:33.440 --> 39:46.320
so one way of conceiving of affect and valence and the emotional aspects of

39:47.360 --> 39:55.840
choosing different plans or making sense of my own bodily sensations is to think a bit in terms of

39:56.480 --> 40:06.000
precision estimation. So one way of carving, one way of a very generic way of thinking about some

40:06.560 --> 40:13.280
negatively effectively charged states of mind would be those states of mind in which there is

40:13.280 --> 40:22.000
irreducible or unresolvable uncertainty. So you know to put simply to be uncertain about what is

40:22.000 --> 40:30.640
going to happen to me or what I should do is to be in a state of angst and that can be linked to

40:30.640 --> 40:39.440
notions such as anxiety and you know with some extra nuances other feelings such as you know

40:40.320 --> 40:47.600
a low affect and indeed if that is pervasive a low mood or or depression but I think the key

40:47.600 --> 40:54.400
thing here and indeed many people have developed a calculus of emotion based upon whether your

40:54.400 --> 40:59.920
average level of uncertainty is increasing or decreasing or is high and low and adding these

40:59.920 --> 41:05.440
things together to get an ontology of emotional states or a purely sort of inference perspective

41:05.440 --> 41:14.480
there's another body of thought and literature which links emotions to the literally gut

41:14.480 --> 41:22.240
feelings, interception. So that certain emotional states are just hypotheses about the way that I

41:22.240 --> 41:28.960
am feeling now that best explain the myriad of extraceptive, intraceptive sensations. So I think

41:29.520 --> 41:37.280
there is a mechanics of affect in certainly intraceptive inference and possibly more generally

41:37.280 --> 41:46.080
in terms of active inference. However there is another aspect of things that we

41:48.080 --> 41:54.880
the feelings that we might associate when we feel compelled to do things and I'm thinking here

41:54.880 --> 42:02.400
not about the irreducible or irresolvable uncertainty but about uncertainty that can

42:02.400 --> 42:09.520
be resolved. I'm thinking here when Hector mentioned Andy Clark's treatment of surprise

42:10.240 --> 42:21.840
there is also the truism that we expect to be surprised and technically that lens that can

42:21.840 --> 42:30.240
be explained in terms of the imperatives for choosing those actions that will resolve uncertainty

42:30.800 --> 42:38.080
about the way the world works. So this is just an expression of novelty. So if we anticipate

42:40.160 --> 42:46.640
that we are going to be surprised by some outcome what we are saying is that that outcome is going

42:46.640 --> 42:53.360
to be informative and that it will reduce some uncertainty. Technically it has a high expected

42:53.360 --> 43:00.960
information gain. So I'm speaking here as a statistician and using terms that would underlie

43:01.520 --> 43:08.960
the Bayesian principles of experimental design that we do these experiments specifically

43:08.960 --> 43:14.720
in order to get surprising outcomes that are by definition going to resolve my uncertainty

43:14.720 --> 43:21.280
about my different hypotheses. So if we think about the misfires that are innovations

43:22.240 --> 43:30.480
these are effectively by definition novel behaviors and there are the fact that people

43:31.200 --> 43:41.040
or certain people in certain regions engage in novelty seeking is entirely sensible from

43:41.040 --> 43:47.520
the point of view of the free energy principle because novelty seeking just is an expression

43:47.600 --> 43:54.160
of curiosity it is just an expression of choosing those outcomes that are going to yield rich

43:54.160 --> 44:01.520
information that has technically a high self-information or an expected information gain.

44:02.080 --> 44:10.960
So this is another view of the if you like the effective aspect that we do we are compelled

44:10.960 --> 44:17.280
and expect ourselves and will possibly explain ourselves as being excited in a positive way

44:17.280 --> 44:23.360
at the opportunity to resolve uncertainty because we see an opportunity to do something novel what

44:23.360 --> 44:28.720
is behind that door you know what is inside this present you know what would happen if I did that

44:28.720 --> 44:34.640
and that's an entirely natural and by natural I mean something that is easily naturalized under

44:34.640 --> 44:41.280
the physics of self-organization of any system that has or entails an implicit generative model

44:41.280 --> 44:48.400
the consequences of its own action. So I thought it was a lovely link between that kind of

44:50.720 --> 45:02.320
affect written into the imperative to seek novelty to seek surprises in the future

45:03.680 --> 45:10.000
and what Michael was saying about well yes in order to do that you still have you still have

45:10.000 --> 45:19.120
you have to suspend your your prior convictions because if you a priori think you know everything

45:19.120 --> 45:25.440
there is no novelty there is no imperative for expiration and you just do the same thing time

45:25.440 --> 45:32.240
and time again but if you're in a if you can recognize that there is reducible uncertainty

45:32.800 --> 45:39.600
and choose those actions that have the greatest expected expected information gain then you

45:39.600 --> 45:48.800
will necessarily succumb to novelty seeking behavior and thereby discover those misfire

45:48.800 --> 45:58.320
innovations so and it may be that you know there is well the story that Michael was telling was

45:58.400 --> 46:04.480
that we are built to be curious creatures for much longer we are built to you know to be able

46:04.480 --> 46:13.520
to respond to novelty and to find those innovative novel ways of behaving and you know so that we

46:13.520 --> 46:22.080
remain we were we retain that childlike curiosity as part of our epigenetic neurodevelopmental

46:22.080 --> 46:29.360
programming for much longer than other species so I I think that matches very nicely with

46:30.240 --> 46:35.760
the sort of the basic thesis that Hector was proposing during the presentation it all comes

46:35.760 --> 46:44.960
back to getting the precision of your prior beliefs right and suspending very precise

46:44.960 --> 46:52.080
prior beliefs in order to explore hypotheses and that exploration just is in terms of engaging

46:52.080 --> 46:58.800
in novel innovative behaviors that moves um that you know will resolve your uncertainty

47:00.080 --> 47:06.480
so I if that's right it's sort of engender the question why is there an evolutionary pressure

47:07.280 --> 47:13.760
for this kind of eternal childhood so I want to ask Michael and Hector

47:14.800 --> 47:19.840
because Michael certainly brought in language and cultural niche construction

47:23.040 --> 47:27.840
my guess would be that there will be a circular causality between the

47:28.640 --> 47:37.840
the cultural eco niche and the phenotypes that are trying to adapt to that cultural eco niche

47:37.840 --> 47:44.400
such that they are required or the phenotypes that have the greatest adaptive fitness are those

47:44.400 --> 47:51.920
that retain a greater curiosity in the context of the culture in which they find themselves

47:51.920 --> 47:58.240
and part of that will be necessary to actually understand the communication and the signs and

47:58.240 --> 48:04.160
the semiotics afforded by their conspecifics which could be read just as language so my question is

48:04.160 --> 48:12.720
did this innovative uh does innovative tool use does it emerge um um stochastically or um

48:12.720 --> 48:22.560
sort you know um at certain points along with communication and language um or um are they

48:23.280 --> 48:29.920
or are they not correlated and if they are correlated in terms of you know um you know

48:29.920 --> 48:35.920
historically um what are their thinking about the direction of causality does the fact that you

48:36.720 --> 48:45.440
um um remain curious and innovative for much longer um lead to language that we can you know

48:45.440 --> 48:53.440
engage in novel communicative behaviors or is it that we need to um remain curious and open-minded

48:53.440 --> 49:00.080
in terms of um thinking about or entertaining novel plans and innovative plans simply because we

49:00.160 --> 49:06.000
have to make sense of a world that is rich in information because there is language that is

49:06.000 --> 49:11.840
that has been culturally inherited or is it both is there is a both top down and bottom up causation

49:13.840 --> 49:22.320
so so two questions language tool use and copying and the um the coupling between the

49:22.320 --> 49:29.920
sort of evolutionary um phylogetic um sorry the phylogetic on the um the um sort of phenotypic

49:30.800 --> 49:37.280
levels when it comes to things like language well um I wonder if I could come in here

49:39.200 --> 49:45.840
Daniel is it okay if I address uh calls questions yes in whatever order you like

49:45.840 --> 49:56.000
thank you um well in the first place there is a voluminous literature on the relationship between

49:56.640 --> 50:04.240
language and the origins of toolmaking and tool use uh really and there's a lot of

50:04.240 --> 50:10.960
unresolved argument about whether the two came together very early in human evolution

50:10.960 --> 50:15.360
let's say between one million and two million and one and a half million years ago

50:16.240 --> 50:24.640
as I originally thought some years ago or whether in fact languages we know it or shall we say

50:24.640 --> 50:31.920
fluent communication at least uh only developed much later as I'm coming around to believe now

50:31.920 --> 50:37.680
and as Noam Chomsky has said for many many years uh I don't want to get involved in that because

50:38.240 --> 50:45.600
really we would need two or three programs and a lot of literature to compare and contrast

50:47.920 --> 50:54.400
rather I would query whether we have an eternal childhood

50:56.160 --> 51:00.800
on the contrary I think that physiological childhood

51:01.520 --> 51:11.120
is slowed down and when the adolescent growth spurt arises after about the age of let's say

51:11.760 --> 51:16.640
nine years old uh at sometimes or perhaps somewhat later at others

51:18.000 --> 51:26.720
is when we see a major change uh in behavior which is no longer childish but is neither is it

51:27.680 --> 51:33.360
adult um of course we needn't go into that we all know that adolescents can be very impetuous

51:34.720 --> 51:41.440
but they can also be extremely anxious and this brings us to the angst that uh Carl has mentioned

51:41.440 --> 51:51.440
and which I certainly felt uh as an adolescent uh facing the weekly viva voce examinations in human

51:51.440 --> 51:58.160
anatomy in the dissecting room which in those days we all had to undergo uh at least in the United

51:58.160 --> 52:04.880
Kingdom uh as I can show uh Carl remembers and which always that put me into a state of extreme

52:04.880 --> 52:16.320
nervousness and has given me a lifelong worry about the lack of accuracy uh let alone precision

52:16.320 --> 52:24.720
in anatomical description and identification uh and a concern um with the statistical

52:25.600 --> 52:33.280
variability in uh uh in human anatomy or aspects of it or anatomy in general necessarily human

52:33.280 --> 52:41.280
and its relation to uh uh process in other words to physiology and I feel myself much more

52:42.240 --> 52:49.360
despite having lectured in human anatomy much more uh aligned to physiology uh and I spent

52:49.360 --> 52:54.320
some time doing your physiological stuff you know many many years ago you know I talked to

52:54.320 --> 53:03.360
him in Göttingen um then uh in the uh classification this has to be that way uh and as we were taught

53:03.360 --> 53:08.800
as medical students all was linked back to about the most obvious rather than the most obscure

53:08.800 --> 53:15.760
but we have to have the whole range before us and this brings in the whole um the whole problem of

53:16.720 --> 53:27.120
do we think in terms of very uh right or wrong concrete uh facts about stuff in general

53:27.920 --> 53:35.280
or do we think in terms of the statistical range of variability whether uh this is uh in terms of

53:36.240 --> 53:44.720
occurrences uh let's say related to um Poisson type distributions or to uh uh continuous

53:44.720 --> 53:51.440
variants which can be let's say related to um Gaussian type distributions and unfortunately it

53:51.440 --> 53:57.920
was only much later in life that I discovered that in fact uh modern statistics allows these two

53:57.920 --> 54:03.920
approaches to be uh compared and contrasted in a uniform manner I didn't know that um

54:05.280 --> 54:14.000
50 years ago alas uh which shows my my my my ignorance still uh I would come back to the

54:14.000 --> 54:23.200
whole business of the growth um curve of of humans that this clearly has altered when we

54:23.200 --> 54:31.120
look at chimpanzees and other great apes basically they don't have much of anything approaching

54:31.120 --> 54:37.840
our adolescents they don't have this slowing down of growth and then a recuperation of the

54:37.840 --> 54:46.800
velocity of growth combined with uh most important not merely anatomical and physiological changes

54:46.800 --> 54:59.520
but also uh those of the mind uh the ability to uh innovate the ability to have lateral thinking

55:00.160 --> 55:08.880
or the ability um which I have noticed in some um uh young people I've met with an

55:08.880 --> 55:16.400
asperger syndrome to be able to concentrate in much great in great detail on particular matters

55:16.400 --> 55:23.120
which are extraordinarily arcane such as Sanskrit literature uh in uh people that are not of a

55:23.120 --> 55:32.800
South Asian heritage uh whereas uh in dealing with uh other people uh their other colleagues uh

55:32.800 --> 55:44.160
they appear to be uh shall we say gauche uh and this is of course well known however and indicates the

55:44.160 --> 55:55.040
range of variability but it is the change which we all undergo uh in not merely physical but also

55:55.840 --> 56:02.560
intellectual uh ability and inquisitiveness uh which could get us into trouble uh when we are

56:02.560 --> 56:13.840
in our adolescence and as young men and women uh given the uh continual and continuous changes in our

56:14.320 --> 56:22.720
urinal architecture at least until our mid-20s these days which I think distinguishes and has

56:22.720 --> 56:29.920
distinguished the evolution of uh homo sapiens well homo in general and homo sapiens in particular

56:29.920 --> 56:38.080
but I wouldn't rule out Neanderthals or even homo erectus and which I think has been cumulative

56:38.640 --> 56:43.360
and undoubtedly although we have no idea undoubtedly

56:44.800 --> 56:55.920
enhanced by uh increased excuse me and ever ever more complicated uh communication

56:58.320 --> 57:03.600
during the the past probably half a million and certainly quarter of a million years

57:03.600 --> 57:12.880
this curiosity what would happen if we did this what would happen if we did that um but

57:14.560 --> 57:24.560
even so things are not rapidly uh grasped and we see that in different parts of the world

57:24.560 --> 57:28.880
particularly in modern populations even that have been long separated from each other

57:29.760 --> 57:36.560
not everything is developed at the same rate a couple of well-known examples

57:37.120 --> 57:45.360
are for example uh the wheel which first appears probably on the Eurasian steps about 5000 years

57:45.360 --> 57:52.480
ago and was used for traction and then appears quite independently in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica

57:53.200 --> 57:59.200
um about 2000 years ago and was not used even that would have been very useful

57:59.200 --> 58:04.080
but even anything as simple as a wheelbarrow but simply to move around in your images

58:05.680 --> 58:11.520
whether they were dolls or toys or gods with no idea and another one taken from the same

58:11.520 --> 58:18.720
two areas of the world uh is the metallurgy of copper which appears about well perhaps over

58:18.720 --> 58:26.400
6000 years ago in Eurasia and possibly 2000 years ago independently in the new world

58:27.840 --> 58:37.520
and yet other things happen too for example in Australia we find modern people were making

58:37.520 --> 58:44.880
hand axes when these had long ceased to be made by anybody outside your uh Australia

58:44.880 --> 58:52.080
some of them may even be um only a few thousand years old so this

58:55.120 --> 59:02.160
appearance and disappearance and reappearance is something which has not gone away and must

59:02.160 --> 59:13.920
be related somehow to our ability to to this deep generation of our inquisitiveness our curiosity

59:14.720 --> 59:22.880
and indeed our ability um to not to see the most obvious thing around us the desire to see

59:24.000 --> 59:33.840
only one simple solution uh this uh which so irritated me when my teachers in the

59:34.880 --> 59:39.760
in has a department when I was a medical student believed that there was only one

59:40.720 --> 59:49.600
right answer asked how many heads this muscle had or which um how many how many

59:50.160 --> 59:53.680
vertebrae there were and this and all that part of the vertebral column

59:54.320 --> 59:59.680
that alone in the skull and we know how very variable these matters can be so

01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:08.320
there is this tension between the desire for things to be seen in one light only

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:18.800
in a one-dimensional way and our natural inquisitiveness this deep deeply generated

01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:27.760
desire to say what would happen if it was like this how is it how has it come to be like that

01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:35.760
why is everything different and not the same I can't put it any other way with that I've said

01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:40.880
of course you know thank you Michael Dean

01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:50.880
thanks Daniel um so again this is for the authors this this has been really helpful to me

01:00:50.880 --> 01:01:00.320
as observers because that's that's highlighted um very clearly in the papers I see both papers um

01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:04.880
speaking to something that I would describe as condition set meaning

01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:13.360
in the papers examples limit the game to the game metaphor at least to this type where there's

01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:21.680
a limited number of tiles and a and a clear continuation until a conclusion or recognize

01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:29.920
the limit of the species to not cracking so there there's a there's a real clear idea and Michael's

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:38.080
and Hector both spoken to so what was the what was the growth limit of the of the

01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:44.480
brain's capacity etc well I'm curious about and I and I don't know if there's a Michael or Hector

01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:53.520
have a a real clear answer to this but I'm wondering what and when was the

01:01:53.760 --> 01:02:03.920
the was maybe the range of time that we see the unlocking or or or sort of combinatorial

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:11.920
explosion or not but what I guess what I'm asking is is is there a move that we can

01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:18.720
clearly see as being something that differentiates playing which we know happens in a lot of species

01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:24.880
and gaming because as I said at the end of 53.1 I wondered if it was going to be game on

01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:31.440
and so I'm I'm curious what the authors think about that is there a difference between playing

01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:41.440
and gaming meaning that there's now an actual introduction of strategy in this um so maybe

01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:48.400
another way of asking it is there a moment when you guys can point to it and say this was kind of

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:58.400
when we saw a a reducing or maybe a relaxing of a of a limit forward world

01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:08.880
I wonder whether in fact this difference is really quite as great as Dean suggests

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:19.760
and whether it may be have something to do with the ability in working memory and other aspects

01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:36.080
of memory in dealing with or in developing a logical mathematical ability to plan or in planning

01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:46.800
and in communicating disability such that the planning is no longer at an on an individual

01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:56.480
level but is participatory and therefore again in other words and perhaps Hector can answer

01:03:56.480 --> 01:04:06.080
this question but I would suggest that this developed slowly gradually and by no means

01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:15.280
in a continual let alone a continuous manner in Homo but not in earlier in a way it did not in

01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:23.200
earlier and other hominid species do we see and this I would ask Hector do we really see

01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:31.840
um let's just say uh well chimpanzees or other great apes developing the kind of

01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:37.680
logical math ability to make very very simple combinatorial

01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:51.600
associations between objects or behavioral activities and developing this into a communal game

01:04:53.200 --> 01:05:00.480
which involves other individuals in the group because as Hector has remarked on various occasions

01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:08.720
and informed me when we see things like nut fat in small groups of chimpanzees by no means

01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:19.040
is copied by all of them let alone copied or emulated by all of them but and by no means

01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:26.480
even when it is with faithful accuracy and precision in the manual operations that are

01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:36.080
required so that I would ask Hector do we see these associations being transformed into games

01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:42.560
okay that's a tricky question um

01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:51.200
I mean what we know with chimpanzees is that they have promised to do these second organ

01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:59.040
relationships which is like hierarchical um ordering of for instance if I have a set of

01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:06.400
objects I can classify them attending to the color for instance chimps could do that okay if

01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:12.560
only color is involved but I can classify them by color and shape so this is another order of

01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:20.480
of hierarchy so I can pick things that are square and red and put them together so this ability to

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:29.520
abstract um a kind of ordering category so that I have relations of relations like in

01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:37.600
analogical reasoning when I I can focus on one dimension or in another simultaneously so I can

01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:42.720
shift my focus from one dimension to another in order to classify things this I think it's

01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:50.400
quite human like for instance the Wisconsin card sorting test so I can shift from one dimension

01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:56.720
to another to classify objects or cards and this is something that chimps would have more

01:06:56.720 --> 01:07:03.520
problems to do so they might classify in a first order categories like I put things that have a

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:10.000
same color they could learn to do that that wouldn't be a big problem but I guess they have to use

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:15.760
two dimensions together to classify objects that we have more problems because this involves

01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:21.840
considering more one that more than one dimension simultaneously I'm not sure I'm making sense here

01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:30.720
this is the the Jonas Langer work that he did with with kids and that's a remarkable work that

01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:37.680
Jonas Langer did and then there were these people in Rome I think it was Poti at the lab of

01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:46.960
um Biopark and Rome that replicated that with um with chimpanzees uh I think it was a spinosci

01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:52.640
who replicated it and found that chimpanzees were more compromised in order to have this kind of

01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:59.920
classificatory relations of relations so and I think that's a very very remarkable ability that

01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:05.120
that uh that we develop so I don't know if I answered your question Michael

01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:20.960
perhaps that comparison of two dimensions color and shape and then the snakes and

01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:32.880
ladders overlay that lets us take the hypotenuse is that abductive jump enabled developmentally

01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:38.160
and neuro epigenetically by all of these different features which happen over much slower

01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:46.880
timescales especially considering the actual millisecond timescale associated with recognition

01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:54.400
those other changes are so much slower but the ability to move diagonally on the grid

01:08:54.800 --> 01:09:01.760
through the rows and the columns and turn that into movement on a manifold

01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:10.960
is the ability looked at from the either row or column perspective to move in both at once

01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:20.000
but by condensing those two dimensions into one there can be new kinds of cognitive movements

01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:31.280
and then applying that cognitivist lens also evolutionary transitions even without the complex

01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:41.600
cumulative feedback with the eco-cultural niche merely in the um abductive moment

01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:49.840
and just one other piece I wanted to return to is that every variable can have a precision

01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:56.240
estimator or not in the generative models and active inference every variable can be fixed

01:09:56.880 --> 01:10:02.880
and so the model can just be persistently surprised with no updating or one can have any

01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:10.320
kind of prior or hyper prior and so on and that enables learning and that's what enables not just

01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:17.360
estimation of the mean or the center of gravity the expectation of but also the variance the whole

01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:28.320
distribution and then it's um by applying that kind of precision on everything view which as

01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:35.040
Michael brought up is exactly what modern statistics does you can't do

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.760
inference with a t-test unless you have the mean and the variance

01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:45.520
we won't go into any more details on the statistics but every variable has the

01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:51.280
center of gravity mean estimator and the variance estimator and so we talked about precision on

01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:56.960
sensory information the mapping between observations and hidden state estimates

01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:02.880
and then also there's this action oriented precision on how things will unfold

01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:10.880
and you might be able to update your precision on sensory evidence by seeing something different

01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:22.880
but updating your precision on how things will unfold is oriented around taking actions

01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:35.120
and

01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:45.840
Daniel you must have some questions I can't be the only one floating questions and having my

01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:48.240
zone of bound and surprise of being expanded here

01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:58.400
I I have um questions I can ask you a question or Michael or Hector or Carl please feel free

01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:06.960
if you're only I would like to pick up with something that professor please don't mention

01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:14.640
before and that was kind of it was intriguing because it is true that some great artists like

01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:22.640
Van Gogh and others were very creative and also I don't know if it's appropriate to say

01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:27.200
that they were in the verge of psychosis I don't know if it's appropriate because I

01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:36.960
don't have any statistics but I'm thinking if being innovative is this again is misfiring so I

01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:44.720
would like to separate two things one is how innovative you are and I'm thinking in the

01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:50.640
economy if you are well adapted to an environment it's not a good idea that you try different

01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:56.080
things all the time because imagine that you have some place where there are nice berries

01:12:56.080 --> 01:13:01.760
you have discovered a safe path to that place and if you keep to that path you go to the berries

01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:07.600
you get there you feed so that's good for you imagine you want to try something new so you

01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:14.240
are very innovative and one day you decide to try another path to the berries a shortcut so you have

01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:20.160
one risk that you can face new dangers because this path is new you don't know what is waiting for

01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:26.000
you there the other is you face it that you can get lost and then you could spend the energy you

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:33.280
need to survive so in a way I don't think that being innovative is good in itself but we have

01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:39.760
the risk if we are too conservative that the environment changes and if the environment changes

01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:45.760
significantly we are not well adapted because we don't have alternative behaviors that are

01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:52.720
adaptive to the new environment so I guess with this happens like psychological traits

01:13:52.720 --> 01:14:00.000
nobody has extremes so we don't have people with extreme psychological personalities I mean

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:06.160
we have pathologies but the selection has favored kind of intermediate levels so I guess

01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:11.280
and Professor Friston can correct me on this he knows more about psychopathology

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:16.880
but I guess it happens with innovation that we need some kind of balance and

01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:25.520
what this is doing for me is how humans escape that balance in terms of how they

01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:33.520
manage to be creative and innovative at times because we are very good we repeat many routines

01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:41.040
so but still we can be very creative and we have selected so we have been successful in

01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:48.000
up to our recognition and I'm just thinking in this counterfactual idea so I think this

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:53.520
might have played a major role the ability to have counterfactuals because perhaps

01:14:54.320 --> 01:15:01.520
instead of risking my life every time I innovate I can rehearse what will happen and as Professor

01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:07.680
Friston mentioned before if I have a good precision I can imagine things that will unfold

01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:17.680
if the genetic model is very deep I can think ahead many steps and see how I will fare in the

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:23.120
future so I can kind of rehearse things in my head before I put them into practice in the real

01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:32.320
world and this might help me to be innovative but with a kind of bounded risk or controlled risk

01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:35.760
I don't know if this makes sense but I think it must be some kind of balance between

01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:40.800
if I can rehearse things in my head I'm very good and predicting things that will

01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:52.400
evolve or unfold many steps ahead I can see how I will fare and then I can risk to be

01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:57.840
innovative I don't know I mean I'm very I'm being very speculative here okay so I just want to

01:15:57.840 --> 01:16:00.480
make clear that I'm being very speculative

01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:12.960
please Cara yeah no I'd like to speak to that yeah I don't yes you may be speculating but I think

01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:19.280
those those observations are very very little and very and very useful I mean you've brought a

01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:25.120
number of fundamental issues to the table first of all the importance of being able to plan

01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:30.960
to have a generative model of the consequences of actions is not the gift of all species and

01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:36.880
and in some instances in your words when the environment doesn't change you that would be

01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:42.480
an undue complexity cost to carry around a brain with a generative model of the consequences of

01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:47.440
my actions if I don't need it if I was a virus or an insect I wouldn't I wouldn't need that it would

01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:56.800
be it would be very inefficient and so that sort of lens brings you to a picture that our world

01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:07.040
is sufficiently complex and changing at pace the committing to very simple underly expressive

01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:12.640
generative models is not an option and one really important way of making the more expressive is to

01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:17.520
increase that temporal horizon or temporal depth so that we can you know in accord with things like

01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:24.400
simulation theory roll out into the future and and now become the kind of phenotypes that can

01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:30.960
select among a number of plausible policies and you know I think that would be one bright line

01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:35.840
between lots of you know different genres and different species you know that could be just

01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:43.520
drawn on a dimension which is just the depth of planning that my generative model will support

01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:51.920
and we've talked previously about that being constrained by the precision afforded in a given

01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:58.400
context my beliefs about how I would roll out into the future so I think that's just you know

01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:04.000
from the from my perspective at least that's a really important observation that the depth of

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:09.520
planning is a very important functional characteristic of the generative models

01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:16.960
that are implicit in phenotypic behavior and possibly in terms of what what kinds of models

01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:23.520
are subject to selective pressure at an evolutionary or indeed at you know an eva diva at an eva diva

01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:32.240
level and the other the other I think key insight that you bring to the table here

01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:42.240
relates to what affords the right balance between novelty seeking exploratory behavior

01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:52.480
and the risks that that would entail and I think you know that from a purely sort of mathematical

01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:59.120
point of view is a really important observation just to sort of join the dots with other ways

01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:06.240
of understanding how the universe works that particular question is very

01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:12.080
usefully framed in terms of constraints so the free energy principle that from which active

01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:20.640
inference inherits is one way of or is dual to something called the maximum entropy principle

01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:29.040
under constraints so this was brought to physics in the 20th century by a foundational thinker

01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:35.520
et james who basically rewrote physics in terms of probability theory and said that basically

01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:45.440
everything of interest at least or physically conforms to a constrained maximum entropy principle

01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:51.120
so that actually is just an expression or form

01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:58.080
for 10s the free energy principle in the sense that the constraints

01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:05.120
in from the point of view of free energy principle are just what is brought to the table by a

01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:13.120
generative model and the entropy pertains to the entropy of belief so you've got this

01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:21.760
this dialectic simply at the level of the physics of measurement and inference

01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:27.200
which means that I'm always trying to explain any measurement

01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:34.960
in such that my predictions are as accurate as possible but at the same time

01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:42.000
leaving having the maximum of the attitude so that I don't over commit in accord with

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:47.280
Occam's principle so mathematically what that means is the entropy of my beliefs has to be as

01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:54.720
big as possible provided I provide provided I have an accurate given the constraint that my

01:20:54.720 --> 01:21:00.480
account on my measurement has to be an accurate measurement so that that may sound if you like

01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:07.280
completely unconnected to whether I choose to wander away from the very path and but in fact

01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:13.920
exactly the same maths applies to these quantities either the constrained entropy

01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:22.080
or the variational free energy in the future and what happens is you get exactly the same dialectic

01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:29.600
you have two pressures on one hand to comply with Occam's principle or Occam's razor

01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:31.200
and on the other hand to

01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:43.840
to keep all your options open which in a sense is exactly do I comply with the constraints

01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:50.080
that I know I'm going to get my barriers and I'm not going to be eating my myself by a predator

01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:56.560
or do I keep my options open and try that other path so this this so dialectic is just baited

01:21:56.560 --> 01:22:03.680
into the physics of any self-organizing system and practically you know it emerges in a number

01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:11.600
of ways one way of writing down the free energy or the constrained entropy from James's point of

01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:19.360
view expected given a particular policy do I go down this path or that path is in terms of ambiguity

01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:25.680
and risk to you're using exactly your words you know so the risk is just the relative entropy on

01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:31.920
the divergence or discrepancy between what I think will happen and what I expect to happen to me

01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:37.200
so I expect not to be eaten and that's the key constraint at hand here there's not about rewards

01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:42.960
anymore we're throwing away the notion of rewards and we're now replacing it with a multi-dimensional

01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:49.040
construct which is all the constraints in the ways of being like having a certain temperature or not

01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:54.240
being very cold or very hot not being eaten not being dead just keeping within my characteristic

01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:59.920
states so you write down those characteristics states in terms of constraints and those constraints

01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:06.800
basically preclude certain states of being and then I just compare well what will my states be

01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:16.400
if I do this and how far away from how far away is that anticipation from my prior constraints

01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:22.000
and that literally is called risk it's the KL divergence between your policy dependent

01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:26.960
predictive posterior and your prior preferences that have the constraints

01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:34.160
the other thing is the ambiguity and that simply reduces to making sure that you make moves in a

01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:47.200
way that underwrites an unambiguous precise mapping between what you see and what caused your

01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:53.040
sensation so you avoid dark rooms basically you avoid the dark you avoid dark alleys you don't go

01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:58.800
where you can't see what's happening so that's the ambiguity so together the expected free

01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:07.680
energy is equal to risk plus ambiguity and when read like that then the balance between

01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:14.240
the risk and the ambiguity or another way of carving this up is in terms of expected information

01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:22.960
gain and expected cost or its complement expected value where the value is just how to what degree

01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:35.040
am I complying with my constraints is enables you to to now write down the balance that resolves

01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:40.960
to a certain extent dissolves that dialectic by the precision of your prior preferences your

01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:49.360
constraints so if you're the kind of creature or child or insect that has very precise beliefs

01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:55.920
about the kinds of outcomes I expect to anticipate and I may have very precise beliefs about my body

01:24:55.920 --> 01:25:01.760
temperature for example but I may have very less precise beliefs about where I am in terms of latitude

01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:07.440
I could be in Alabama I could be in Newcastle London I can still be me but I can't be minus

01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:12.960
your minus two degrees centigrade and still be me so some constraints are very precisely

01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:19.040
specified and other constraints are less precisely specified so the risk is you know

01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:29.840
is determined by the precision of your prior beliefs about your characteristic states the

01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:34.400
precision of the constraints you bring to the table as a phenotype and some people will be innate

01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:41.280
and completely sub-personal it's wired into your home ostensis and some will be learnable some may

01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:47.440
even be sort of oppositional you know we can talk about them but whatever they have to be that

01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:52.720
because they define basically what kind of thing you think you are and how you act accordingly

01:25:52.720 --> 01:26:00.400
so the balance between the you know whether to go down another path as opposed to the berry path

01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:07.280
is going to depend upon this particular creature of phenotype and specifically the precision of

01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:16.880
their prior preferences in terms of what outcomes they would a priori entertain and if they have very

01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:24.240
very precise preferences of not being eaten and there's even a marginal small probability of being

01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:30.080
eaten if they stray from the current path then they won't explore if on the other hand they

01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:39.040
have a slightly more liberal expectation about being about the encounters with the predator for

01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:48.320
example and then there will be more there will be more likely to engage in novelty seeking and

01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:55.680
exploratory behavior so you know perhaps put this even more simply you know that this is the

01:26:55.760 --> 01:27:02.640
exploration exploitation dilemma written in terms of the physics of self-organization under

01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:11.120
planning and you know and it all reduces again to precision and in this instance it's the precision

01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:19.040
of the constraints that are articulated as the your prior preferences your characteristic states

01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:26.880
your the kinds of states that you know you are you believe characterize you that if you stray from

01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:34.800
you cease to be you cease to exist basically so I thought I was I thought you know that's I don't

01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:40.320
think what you said was speculation I think they're all fundamentals of behavior and actually

01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:48.160
um from an ecological perspective you know they speak to the heart of the of choice behavior

01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:55.760
and you know why we do the things we do and why it is always in the background the game

01:27:55.760 --> 01:28:04.000
of saying do I explore or do I play it safe awesome thank you Carl Dean

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:09.200
I think you'd muted Daniel oh thank you thank you Carl go ahead Dean

01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:14.000
I just like to run with what Carl was saying

01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:20.240
this is mostly for Hector and Michael um

01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:28.720
here's a here's a here's a case in point all the collective wisdom on the side of a volcano

01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:36.000
can suddenly be arrested and yet there is still a Pompeii today I wonder what you gentlemen think

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:40.320
that says about certain species zone of founded surprise

01:28:40.720 --> 01:29:02.720
Dean does this refer to the material the fixed materiality alone of the ruins of Pompeii

01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:07.680
of which no more will ever exist in the

01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:14.800
archaeological context being able to be unpacked into this collective wisdom

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:22.000
I'm just curious because we are talking about regular irregularities and regular irregularities

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:30.880
these these seismic events occur in the timeline and I'm just curious what we think then as we

01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:38.000
reflect on that and still adopt that kind of risk mindset as I said I just want to run with what

01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:45.920
Carl was was suggesting and I don't know that I don't know that there's an equivalent I don't

01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:55.120
know if I if I if chimpanzees would do what humans have done like see the evidence and still

01:29:55.760 --> 01:30:03.760
you know park themselves right in the path of of danger I'm just curious what they think about that

01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:07.360
in terms of the timeline aspect of this

01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:22.000
Hector or Michael go ahead

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:26.000
I don't think you're muted now Hector

01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:31.200
sorry my microsoft

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:39.040
so it's a kind of difficult question Dean I'm not sure if I understood correctly

01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:47.360
but as you're referring to the zone of founded surprise and linking what what Professor Christon

01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:54.800
said before if I'm to take any road which is I don't know what awaits for me there okay

01:30:55.920 --> 01:31:05.120
but if I'm very good at making guesses or inferring what might happen based on information I have

01:31:05.120 --> 01:31:13.360
gathered before so I'm good at anticipating what might unfold okay because I have this complex

01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:18.000
machinery let's call it working memory which is a construct I have a powerful working memories

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:24.320
for I have entertained many possibilities and there is something that kind of

01:31:26.320 --> 01:31:35.040
ring bell when Professor Christon was talking of precision which is the concept of metacognition

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:45.360
so metacognition refers to thinking about my own thinking right so I and you have to clear

01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:55.920
to clear aspects one is how sure am I about my knowledge for instance I'm sure I know

01:31:57.280 --> 01:32:03.440
something even when I cannot remember this is the tip of the tongue effect so I can be

01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:10.480
or I can give you an answer and be 100% sure this answer is correct I can be 80% sure 50%

01:32:10.480 --> 01:32:18.080
sure so I can evaluate how much sure I am about something okay so this I think it looks a bit

01:32:18.080 --> 01:32:25.680
like precision so if I make some expect plans and I think one might unfold I can be very sure

01:32:25.680 --> 01:32:31.520
this will happen or not and this probably has to do with my metacognition so how sure I am

01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:36.320
about what will happen and that might help me to decide whether I go or not

01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:47.920
and coming back to your son of under surprise I'm not sure if I'm digressing but perhaps I can

01:32:47.920 --> 01:32:56.880
preempt the surprise if I have a good precision or good metacognition so if I'm sure that I can

01:32:56.880 --> 01:33:04.480
rehearse things in my head and see how they will unfold they won't be that surprising later

01:33:04.480 --> 01:33:11.840
so I'm just speculating perhaps this ability to have counterfactuals to have this kind of

01:33:11.840 --> 01:33:20.240
rehearsing in my head and this depth of generative models can be empty surprise and here I'm

01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:26.400
speculating clearly so I don't know if I answer your question about Pompeii because I'm not sure

01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:34.400
they understood but just bring some some ideas that might be useful but again they are speculative

01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:45.840
it'd be nice just to link that notion of metacognition and having beliefs about beliefs

01:33:45.840 --> 01:33:51.440
you know the precision of a belief about the likelihood of being eaten by a predator

01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:58.800
I think that's what Daniel was speaking to before when he was talking about the hierarchical depth

01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:06.080
of models and their increasing complexification one really important way of making a model more

01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:12.560
expressive and context sensitive is to induce a hierarchy of exactly the sort that Hector was

01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:18.960
talking about in terms of this metacognitive aspect but not just content but crucially again

01:34:19.040 --> 01:34:28.320
coming back to the confidence and the precision I think that's a really central concept and I

01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:40.000
was just thinking you know if you had to commit to what kinds of epigenetically specified constraints

01:34:40.960 --> 01:34:48.560
you would associate with the genome what in what space would they live

01:34:49.760 --> 01:34:54.880
and my guess is that most of it is about the constraints and within that it's going to be

01:34:54.880 --> 01:35:02.800
the constraints on the precisions that there are certain sort of innate ranges of outcomes that I

01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:11.280
will entertain and in in principle at least you can actually just write down an entire

01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:18.640
generative model in terms of constraints and in terms of precisions in the sense that if the

01:35:18.640 --> 01:35:26.080
generative model is universally expressive and everything goes then you can sort of carve out

01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:37.040
an apt structural form for that generative model despite shrinking some of or 99.9% of this overly

01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:45.360
expressive generative model to zero with very very precise constraints so well perhaps I'll

01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:54.560
turn this into a question if you were trying to simulate artificial life in its most generic sense

01:35:54.560 --> 01:36:00.480
if you're trying to simulate tool use for example the emergence of tool use in a synthetic

01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:09.440
population and you had to actually write down what could be asked via genetically or epigenetically

01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:14.240
to each subsequent generation what what kinds of things would you specify

01:36:25.520 --> 01:36:30.080
that's kind of my question in the same in the same sense how do we

01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:37.520
where where do we draw those arbitrary lines I mean it's this it's the thing that comes up again

01:36:37.520 --> 01:36:44.960
and again as we continue to sort of see the next the next sedimentary layer of papers discussing

01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:52.800
this right but the but the fact that it can be moving and the fact that it it isn't there is

01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:58.000
a rate constant that you mentioned in the last live stream that has to be

01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:06.560
working functioning and effective and then there's still this question of so

01:37:08.480 --> 01:37:15.760
so what is our our but what are we attending to and what are we still available to all at once

01:37:15.760 --> 01:37:24.160
and how do we organize that in a way that it most closely as you say precisely if that that's

01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:33.120
the best way to describing it what's really going on and that that's that that seems to me at least

01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:44.880
to be a moving target just one quick speculative mapping as well first the um instead of just

01:37:44.880 --> 01:37:53.600
stacking bricks with content on content on content intercalating layers of content estimation

01:37:53.600 --> 01:38:00.080
with metacognitive estimation is what allows the extendability of the multi-layer predictive

01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:06.880
processing type architectures it's actually like the back and forth or the interplay between

01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:15.200
the content estimators and the variance estimators that allows that model to

01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:22.720
not just be described in terms of its center of gravity but also in terms of its full distribution

01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:29.600
and then to Carl's question about what is being passed down genetically and epigenetically

01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:36.560
and thinking about those terms even generically like in the context of perhaps source code

01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:44.240
and a configuration file or some other mapping of like what is inscribed from a classical information

01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:53.200
genetic perspective and then what is contextually and more rapidly transmitted there's an interesting

01:38:53.200 --> 01:39:00.800
angle I could see it this way or potentially the opposite but there's a shorter term epigenetic

01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:12.880
firing rate and then a slower updating of neuromodulatory like genetic possibilities

01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:20.480
kind of opening and closing valves over a slower timescale and then of course these are nested

01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:25.920
within another one so what is what is neuromodulatory this can also itself be a firing rate in other

01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:35.440
ways but just focusing on this direction the inscribed constraints are like the width of the

01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:44.000
aperture and then the actual flow of the photons through the lens is an instantaneous firing rate

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:52.880
that's happening way faster than the aperture can be dilated or not and so merely the fact that there

01:39:52.880 --> 01:40:00.400
are multiple concurrent timescales and the associated interplay of their rate constants

01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:11.040
tells us a lot about this kind of learning architecture what we do without understanding

01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:20.320
is the action question and related to our preferences and precision however it seems

01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:31.120
pretty key that to alternate estimates about content with metacognitive type estimates

01:40:31.120 --> 01:40:39.680
and to package that set of two belief distributions mean and variance to package those also as one

01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:44.320
so it can be handled as a composite one

01:40:54.480 --> 01:41:01.680
and just to point out that learning rates are the manifestation of that second order

01:41:01.680 --> 01:41:10.800
specification that precision so they are the same thing at every timescale

01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:19.200
so you could articulate the developmental stages for example the

01:41:19.360 --> 01:41:29.440
rejuvenation but certainly the changes say in late adolescent

01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:38.480
as a programmed learning rate or learnability that can be read at some level as a precision

01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:43.920
because the precision is just the rate constants that link the state to the rate of change of the

01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:50.960
state and that basically is just a learning rate at many many different levels so I think it was a

01:41:50.960 --> 01:41:57.760
sort of uniform way of putting together these different notions some useful notions here

01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:08.320
from machine learning are sort of the notion of learning to infer you know so I was just

01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:12.880
thinking about my an answer to my own question and clearly you can't write down a generative model

01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:18.560
that's going to be able to get up and go to school in the morning all you can do is to

01:42:19.680 --> 01:42:28.080
create a self-organizing blob that has exactly the right learning rates so that it is has exactly

01:42:28.080 --> 01:42:32.960
the right learnability so that it can acquire a generative model and learn through experience

01:42:32.960 --> 01:42:39.680
dependent plasticity that model of its little lived world of course that little lived world

01:42:39.680 --> 01:42:46.960
has been constructed by other grown-up babies so you know we get back to this circular

01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:53.120
causality that evolution is trying to provide you with the right ability learning rates,

01:42:53.120 --> 01:43:00.880
precisions and structural constraints on your generative model but your generative models

01:43:00.880 --> 01:43:04.560
from the evolutionist point of view are actually creating the environment that has to be learned

01:43:05.200 --> 01:43:10.160
so there's to my mind isn't there's you know a very beautiful circular causality here

01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:17.200
that you know as fast as you're learning you're actually creating new worlds in which to learn

01:43:17.920 --> 01:43:22.160
you know I guess we're seeing that at the moment with the advances in technology and the like

01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:30.000
which brings me back to my question about the sort of the top-down versus bottom-up causation

01:43:30.640 --> 01:43:37.360
about you know what is a good model of this world what is a good phenotype?

01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:59.920
in our final 15 minutes or so here how do we move beyond the 53.2 either to the authors

01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:11.280
their directions and excitements about the work or anyone's exhortations or

01:44:12.960 --> 01:44:26.480
raising of possibilities for other ways it can be developed

01:44:30.880 --> 01:44:39.280
I wonder if it's worth bearing in mind that

01:44:43.440 --> 01:44:49.600
increasing technological not necessarily complexity but at least variability

01:44:49.920 --> 01:45:00.560
may well have permitted a reduction in selection pressure on the

01:45:02.800 --> 01:45:12.880
phenotype and evidently affecting both the genotype and epigenetic

01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:22.400
variability I see this because I would like to draw attention to the the graph which I

01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:30.080
presented last week which was taken from Professor Philip Tabars's work on early humans

01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:39.280
showing an increasing range of variation in the cranial capacity of

01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:49.200
bipedal hominids from the osteopathy signs through to homo sapiens suggesting a reduction

01:45:51.040 --> 01:46:00.720
in selection pressure for particular well for the size of the brain basically

01:46:01.120 --> 01:46:13.600
I find it hard not to relate this to the advantages that slowly accrued to

01:46:17.280 --> 01:46:24.320
tool use and thereby of course the variability and variation of tool making

01:46:24.640 --> 01:46:33.360
thereby reducing the risk or some of the risks existential risks

01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:47.120
that otherwise plague or have plagued other hominins whether extant whether the ancestors

01:46:47.120 --> 01:46:56.800
of extant great apes or indeed the earlier forms of bipedal hominin and osteopathy signs

01:46:56.800 --> 01:47:07.040
palanthropus canianthopus etc well who knows but it's perhaps

01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:19.280
um not totally irrelevant that this variability has grown over the past couple of million years

01:47:19.840 --> 01:47:23.680
and is now very wide as I mentioned last week

01:47:23.680 --> 01:47:36.080
this I think is in contradiction to the the way in which

01:47:37.600 --> 01:47:47.040
selection pressures have been highly discriminatory in for example producing let's say the wide range

01:47:47.040 --> 01:47:52.400
of Darwin's famous Galapagos finches yeah just to give a well-known example

01:47:57.280 --> 01:48:07.280
thank you Carl can I ask um coming back to this theme of um selection for selectability

01:48:07.360 --> 01:48:18.400
um and the notion of precision or learning rates cast in terms of mutation rates so

01:48:18.400 --> 01:48:23.840
you're my favorite example of and I'm sure there are better ones nowadays when I was reading around

01:48:23.840 --> 01:48:31.760
this subject my favorite example was um the story told by Ernst Merer about Drosophila fruit flies

01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:38.480
being reared in volatile versus non-volatile environments so you're rearing generation after

01:48:38.480 --> 01:48:45.360
generation at a fairly fixed temperature and then an equivalent set of generations where they've

01:48:45.360 --> 01:48:52.240
varied the temperature um you're a few degrees plus and minus um and what they showed was that the

01:48:52.240 --> 01:48:58.800
mutation rate of the Drosophila in the volatile changing environment

01:48:59.040 --> 01:49:06.560
was greater than the mutation rate the genetic mutation rate in the less volatile population or

01:49:06.560 --> 01:49:12.240
transgenerational populations which I thought was a beautiful example of selection for selectability

01:49:12.240 --> 01:49:20.000
itself that you know that increased variation um certainly or it's you know a phenotypic

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:27.440
expression of implicit increased genomic variability was itself an adaptive response to

01:49:27.840 --> 01:49:34.080
the rate of change of the environment so my question is is there a similar sort of picture

01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:45.680
or view of um variation in um either phenotypic or genetic um characteristics in um over a longer

01:49:45.680 --> 01:49:54.480
time scale in in sort of um human evolution uh and if there is is there any evidence um

01:49:55.040 --> 01:49:58.720
that there's go that there is in the past century or so um

01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:05.600
perhaps this is a bit of an ambitious uh ask but uh is there any evidence that the

01:50:06.640 --> 01:50:12.480
there has been a sort of phase transition in the variability and the evolvability and the

01:50:12.480 --> 01:50:29.360
associated um phenotypic variation the empirical or an empirical research agenda would be to make

01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:35.840
a hierarchical active inference model and perform dynamic causal modeling on different

01:50:35.840 --> 01:50:44.880
variability characters across levels of phenotypic and genotypic integration and have that model

01:50:46.880 --> 01:50:54.800
in use but a very provocative and interesting question Carl

01:50:55.040 --> 01:51:06.320
and to what extent is it happening with our cellular architecture and to what

01:51:06.320 --> 01:51:15.360
extents are these processes happening with our niche given these unique cumulative cultural

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:21.920
generative model generative process thinking through other minds increasingly the production

01:51:21.920 --> 01:51:32.960
of artifacts that enable not just offloading but outsourcing these do represent unique cognitive

01:51:32.960 --> 01:51:45.040
niches and so it will be quite interesting to investigate perhaps if we each want to have

01:51:45.040 --> 01:51:56.800
some closing round thoughts perhaps dean with the first word thank you because you know I hate

01:51:56.800 --> 01:52:03.920
having the last one I'm just curious gentlemen thank you first again for for your generosity

01:52:04.560 --> 01:52:10.400
I'm just curious now that you've dipped your toes in this this active inference institute

01:52:10.400 --> 01:52:17.200
live stream world what are your what are your impressions is was it was it it was it helpful at

01:52:17.200 --> 01:52:37.840
all who is next you okay so I think that's been very useful and mostly very I mean I've enjoyed

01:52:37.840 --> 01:52:45.440
a lot to have this discussion with all of you so it's been very enjoyable and just for the future

01:52:47.680 --> 01:52:54.400
I'm just wondering if there is such a thing like preempting surprise based on these counterfactuals

01:52:54.400 --> 01:53:00.000
I guess maybe it's already written and discussed and it's all clear but I wonder that this might be

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:08.240
an interesting idea to explore if I can preempt to surprise before I act I mean for even acting but

01:53:08.240 --> 01:53:15.600
that's kind of maybe that's resolved already anyway it has been fun thank you all honestly

01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:25.200
thank you that makes me think about saying I don't mean to surprise you but that's actually

01:53:25.280 --> 01:53:31.280
going to increase it's like oh boy has someone been injured but what is the show not tell

01:53:33.040 --> 01:53:42.080
of preempting surprise so that with a linear string in time there is the path from the old

01:53:42.080 --> 01:53:51.360
berry patch to the new berry patch such that it appears to be within a nested hierarchical model

01:53:51.360 --> 01:54:00.320
the path of least action to follow though in a less nested model it would be quite surprising

01:54:07.360 --> 01:54:18.480
Michael or Carl your kind of closing thoughts or questions as we bring this set of 53 to a close

01:54:18.800 --> 01:54:24.640
well I'll let Michael have the last word and

01:54:26.640 --> 01:54:33.120
what you just said in Hector's comment I think there's a lot of interest in that in that notion

01:54:33.120 --> 01:54:39.920
you know sort of trying to preempt surprise I mean a simple reading of risk minimization

01:54:39.920 --> 01:54:45.760
you're just basically not engaging in policies that are going to result in surprising outcomes

01:54:45.760 --> 01:54:53.120
where surprise is just the violation of prior preferences and so at that level I think that's

01:54:53.120 --> 01:55:02.000
that sort of almost a truism but there is an interesting there's an interesting sort of

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:08.240
implication of that which leads to notions of the way that we choose to behave epistemically

01:55:08.240 --> 01:55:15.760
in terms of avoiding information that would be very surprising sometimes articulate in terms of

01:55:15.760 --> 01:55:21.440
optimism bias sometimes in terms of wishful thinking but the kind of paradox that you get

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:28.320
when we are Bayes optimal creatures and yet we don't want to open the letter from the GP giving

01:55:28.320 --> 01:55:34.720
us our most recent cancer results or we don't want to open that letter whether we fail to get

01:55:34.720 --> 01:55:41.600
that job or pass that exam or indeed the anatomy dissection survivor and there are certain things

01:55:41.600 --> 01:55:48.000
that we avoid there are certain surprises that we avoid or split another way there are certain ways

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:56.400
of preempting surprise by avoiding knowing stuff that we might find surprising and that's an emerging

01:55:56.400 --> 01:56:01.600
literature now which takes you a little bit outside your comfort zone but it's a fascinating

01:56:01.600 --> 01:56:07.200
literature because you'll find things like trends in cognitive science and and the like

01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:12.400
in answer to Dean's question about these sessions because this is not my first session so but

01:56:14.240 --> 01:56:22.160
but this does exemplify it yeah it's for fun and we're amongst friends and indulging ourselves

01:56:22.160 --> 01:56:28.160
and those people who care to listen to us so I think the next thing to do is the next horizon

01:56:28.160 --> 01:56:34.320
although I do think dynamic calls the modeling of evolutionary trajectories is an excellent idea

01:56:34.960 --> 01:56:40.640
I suspect the heavy lifting now is to get the ideas that we've been talking about out there

01:56:40.640 --> 01:56:46.240
I think that's what Michael and Hector have to do basically it's just keep keep on telling the story

01:56:46.240 --> 01:56:50.320
and in my experience usually takes about five to ten years before people start listening

01:56:50.880 --> 01:57:00.400
thank you Carl Michael with the last word

01:57:02.480 --> 01:57:09.040
well there have been these sessions have been fun and most illuminating there is a lot to be done on

01:57:09.040 --> 01:57:15.120
the matter of whether there have been phased transitions in the evolution of what we might

01:57:15.200 --> 01:57:20.560
call evolvability in again as Homer over the past two million years there are big

01:57:20.560 --> 01:57:27.840
arguments amongst human evolution specialists between whether there was a unitary evolutionary

01:57:30.400 --> 01:57:38.160
whether a unitary evolutionary model is acceptable or as lumpers like myself would like to believe

01:57:38.160 --> 01:57:47.600
or whether in fact there was a big bush with a lot of dead end separate unsuccessful

01:57:48.560 --> 01:58:01.440
species like homo flori ciensis, homo allelusoniensis, homo allelidae or even perhaps Neanderthals

01:58:01.440 --> 01:58:05.680
with whom I've had a lot of contact have excavated about 15 of them

01:58:06.240 --> 01:58:16.400
and these arguments are highly relevant to the matter of cognitive evolution and indeed

01:58:16.960 --> 01:58:25.840
as to whether the record of artifacts and tools can indeed inform us as I believe it can about

01:58:26.720 --> 01:58:37.760
just how and how slowly I would say evolution proceeds proceeded and of course the splitters

01:58:37.760 --> 01:58:44.800
believe it happened in leaps jumps and leaps I'm rather convinced Darwinist I believe that things

01:58:44.800 --> 01:58:51.520
happen very very slowly and that we have to concentrate and with this I conclude on

01:58:52.160 --> 01:59:04.400
the especially the neuro epigenetic modification of genetic expression as affecting not merely

01:59:04.400 --> 01:59:13.520
morphology and physiology but also I would say cognition and the matter in hand of course

01:59:14.080 --> 01:59:24.640
the ability or not to let our surprises affect one lookers and other people

01:59:25.440 --> 01:59:35.520
permitting let's say modification of behavior in a very wide in a far wider with far wider results

01:59:35.520 --> 01:59:44.240
than those that occur in many other species including some of those of our closest

01:59:45.200 --> 01:59:52.080
closest primate relatives and thank you very much for organizing this session Daniel and Dean

01:59:52.960 --> 02:00:00.240
it's been a pleasure to take part I'm sorry that I have this terrible appearance but I

02:00:00.880 --> 02:00:07.920
I really can't do much about that at the moment I had well lost a few days

02:00:10.560 --> 02:00:14.320
thank you all Michael at least you have an excuse I have no excuse

02:00:20.080 --> 02:00:27.440
all right till next time long live the mean long live the variants thank you

02:00:27.440 --> 02:00:30.320
you bye everybody

02:00:57.440 --> 02:00:59.440
You
