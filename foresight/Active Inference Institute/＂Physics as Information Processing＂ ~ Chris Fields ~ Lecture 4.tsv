0	14080	Hello and welcome, everyone. This is Physics as Information Processing, Session 4 on Communicating
14080	20960	Observers. It's the 10th of August 2023. Chris, looking forward to this lecture off to you.
23520	26320	Thank you, Daniel, and welcome to this session.
27280	32480	As Daniel said, this is about communicating observers and fastening your seatbelts,
32480	35200	because we have a lot to cover in the next hour.
36880	43440	So just to do a quick review, we've been talking about quantum information theory,
43440	51200	and we've been talking about it in the simplest possible setting of two systems, Alice and Bob,
51920	55440	that exchange information through their mutual boundary.
56320	61920	And we've assumed that everything is finite dimensional, so we don't need to worry about
61920	68320	infinite energy transfer across this boundary. And of course, we assume conservation of energy,
68320	73520	so there are no sources or sinks in either of the systems Alice and Bob.
74240	81040	And we emphasize that this way of depicting things as topological, we're not assuming any
81040	86400	background geometry, no sort of spatial embedding, which is going to become very important in this
86400	95360	session. In the last session, we talked about how the boundary, which I'll always call B,
96400	102720	it can be thought of as a channel that comprises in qubits that are independent,
102720	110320	and Alice and Bob each can prepare and measure those qubits. And they can always choose
110320	116240	independently their reference frames for doing so, so how they define up and down when they're
116240	123920	measuring a spin with effectively a Z-spin operator to interact with these qubits.
125760	130320	We talked a little bit about the free energy principle and its quantum formulation.
131520	137360	And the principle basically says that interacting systems will behave in a way that aligns their
137360	142800	reference frames and that they therefore asymptotically approach entanglement.
143360	150320	So the FEP is a classical limit of the principle of uniterity. And that's one reason for studying
150320	157280	quantum information to learn more about the FEP and so to learn more about active inference
157280	160800	and what the theory of active inference says about agents.
160800	171520	And last time we talked a lot about the constraints that are imposed by a limited free energy supply
171520	179280	on any agent. Recall that we talked about the fact that in the absence of sources of free energy
181680	188560	within an agent, so as long as you conserve energy globally, that the free energy that each
188560	195680	agent uses has to come from its environment. That's clearly true for us. We have to consume oxygen
195680	203200	and eat food and things like that to keep running as systems. And we discussed a little bit this
203200	212000	theorem that if two reference frames or quantum processes Q1 and Q2 don't commute,
212800	217920	they have to be implemented by compartments that communicate classically. And we'll use this
217920	225200	extensively today. But the bottom line last time was that physics alone gives us compartmentalization
225200	231680	in systems whenever the systems are complex enough to have multiple kinds of measurements that they
231680	243360	can't deploy simultaneously. So where we're going, today we're going to start from this
243360	249520	place we left off last time of the possibility of agents that are compartmentalized
250640	257120	and into compartments that have to communicate classically. So we're going to talk about agents
257120	264000	that can be compartmentalized into multiple subagents that share an environment, the environment
264000	270480	consisting of Bob, and how those agents talk about that shared environment.
271440	278240	So the motivation for this is simple. It's that what we do all the time is a group activity.
278240	283440	And what we're doing right now is a group activity that involves sharing an environment,
283440	292880	what's shown on this screen, and talking about it. And the whole post-session discussion process
293520	300800	will be another example of just that sort of thing. So to talk about science at all, or to talk
300800	306960	about any kind of social relations, or to talk about anything other than solipsism, we have to
306960	312640	be able to talk about how multiple agents communicate about some shared environment.
313600	317600	And so that's what we're going to develop a formal way of talking about.
317600	327520	And there are two things to notice right off the top about this. One is that the way we've defined
327520	333200	interactions of boundaries, they're effectively instantaneous. So each agent, remember,
334080	340240	interacts with its boundary with some set of operators. And what those operators do is
340240	346720	effectively measure, each operator effectively measures the spin of a cubic. So this is a very
346720	357200	fast process. The other thing that we then need to notice is that if we have two agents,
358720	366320	and they're communicating with each other classically, then they're going to be using degrees
366320	372160	of freedom of their shared environment in order to communicate. And that's exactly what we're
372160	380240	doing right now. For example, we're using degrees of freedom of the internet to communicate. I'm
380240	386880	using degrees of freedom of the local atmosphere to talk to my microphone. And I'm using degrees of
386880	396000	freedom of the local photon field to see my screen. So all communication between agents,
396960	399920	and certainly all classical communication between agents,
400560	405760	uses degrees of freedom of the environment. And the environment, remember, is the other system,
405760	412480	Bob, that's on the other side of that shared boundary. So we're going to be interested in
412480	419680	how components of Alice use Bob as a communication channel, and in fact, as multiple communication
419760	427280	channels. And I just wanted to quote my colleague and friend, Mike Levin, in his statement that
427280	435440	all intelligence is composite. All of us, all organisms, even single cells, are composite
435440	443520	systems that comprise many, many different agents that are able to make different kinds of measurements
444080	449040	and execute different kinds of actions, and so have to communicate classically.
450080	457040	So we're talking about all of life here, as well as all of social systems and ecosystems,
457040	465360	and such things as that. So the first thing I want to do today is simplify the notation
467040	472160	so that we don't have to draw quite such complicated diagrams. So the picture on the left
472160	478800	here is a picture from the last session. It shows the structure of a very simple agent that
480000	486560	makes some measurements using a reference frame called E, and then writes some results of those
486560	493440	measurements to memory using a reference frame called Y. And those two processes are connected
493440	501840	by an internal clock that ticks between the input process and the output process. And the clock
501840	507600	tick corresponds to the expenditure of free energy to write information irreversibly on the
507600	513280	boundary. So the memories are actually written on the boundary because that's where classical
513280	520160	information lives in this theory. So you can think of this whole process from E through the clock and
520160	527840	back to Y as a single quantum process or as a quantum computation that maps some sector E of
527840	534560	the boundary to some sector Y of the boundary. And so we can represent it in this much simpler way
534560	542400	that's over on the right side as some process Q that maps some sector on the boundary to some
542400	549920	other sector on the boundary. And formally, that process can be thought of as a topological quantum
549920	556640	field theory. Topological here is important. It's not geometric. It doesn't assume an embedding
556640	564400	in space. And this will become critically important later on. And the operation of that
566320	573280	TQFT requires a clock tick, or it incorporates a tick of this internal clock.
574480	584640	And we can do this because we were able to prove, Jim Glaceburg and Tonino Marchiano and I were
584640	591040	able to prove last year, that we can always represent a quantum reference frame as a topological
591040	596640	quantum field theory. And this just illustrates the two kinds of transformations between
597680	602240	quantum reference frames that are important. We can take one and divide it into two pieces
602240	612800	that commute, or we can take a two-part reference frame, and we can swap in
614160	620320	another part that doesn't commute with the part that we've swapped it in for, but that does commute
620320	628320	with the remainder of the reference frame. So here, R is the reference component of some object
628320	635920	identification system. And we can swap in some different way of looking at the object
635920	642320	once we've identified. So for example, if the object that we're identifying is a box that can
642320	651280	measure both Z-spin and X-spin, then P and Q can be the Z-spin and X-spin settings on that box
652080	658400	that allow us to effectively rotate the filter from this way to that way, so that we measure
659040	665920	vertical spin versus horizontal spin. And that's really it. I mean, those are the ways that one
665920	672320	can transform quantum reference frames. Of course, we can do arbitrarily many compositions of this
672320	678080	kind of transformation to do something very complicated, but they map very simply to TQFTs
678080	685120	with the structure, and you can construct categories out of this and find a fumpter that's
685120	692000	well-defined that maps one category to another. So it's an example of the niches of categorical
692000	698080	techniques for solving a problem that looks difficult, but in fact, it's very straightforward.
698240	707360	So using this simplified notation, it becomes very easy to see
709280	714560	that if we have two systems, Alice and Bob, on opposite sides of this boundary,
715440	723760	and we perfectly align their quantum reference frames, which is what the FEP says they will
723760	732560	tend to do, then they become entangled. And you can see that they're entangled by seeing that once
732560	739680	the reference frames are perfectly aligned, they jointly implement one quantum process.
741760	749040	And jointly implementing one quantum process just means you're entangled. The two sides no longer
749040	758080	have conditionally independent states. If one quantum process, which is time reversible,
758080	766960	information preserving, is implemented jointly by the two systems. So a lot of things like
766960	777680	this become very simple when we think of these processes as just quantum computations going on
777680	785680	inside some system implemented by some system and how those processes relate across some boundary.
786320	792320	So that's what we're going to do for studying communication today.
794400	801840	Another thing to recall from a couple of sessions ago, or last session, is that if two
802480	811520	reference frames Q1 and Q2 commute, we can always join them together to form a single
811520	818160	reference frame. And this is just a graphical depiction in this simpler language of how that works.
819280	826800	And topologically, there's no distinction between the left side and the right side.
826800	831520	What I've done is just squeeze the top two green circles together and the bottom two
831520	838480	green circles together into one circle. And that just makes a simple process connecting
838480	844320	the top one to the bottom one. So what we're going to be interested in is situations where this
844320	854880	doesn't happen, where Alice consists of two components that execute reference frames that
854880	864240	don't commute. And so the two components are conditionally independent. They do each have
864240	871280	free choice of reference frame. And so they have to communicate classically. They don't share
873520	881840	a single quantum process. So they're not entangled. And before we go ahead to do that,
882560	890240	I just wanted to remind you of some of the no-go theorems that follow from this situation
891280	898480	depicted on the right, where we have a single agent executing a single reference frame,
898480	905840	a single process, a single kind of measurement, any set of commuting measurements that can be
905840	911760	combined into one measurement. And here's some things Alice can't do. And we've talked about
911760	921920	some of these previously. So this is basically a reminder. But Alice can't, using just one
921920	929200	measurement, measure the entanglement entropy across her own boundary. So Alice can't know
929200	936720	that she has an independent state. She can't know that she's not entangled with Bob. And that's a
936720	944400	useful thing to think about philosophically, as it applies to you and me. We can't actually know
944400	952560	that we have independent states. Alice can't measure her own entanglement entropy. So she
952560	957360	can't know whether she has components that have to communicate classically.
959680	966000	She can't measure Bob's entanglement entropy. So she can't know whether Bob has compartments
966000	971120	that have to communicate classically. And if you think in terms of perception theory,
972240	978400	this says Alice can't know whether Bob consists of separate objects that behave classically.
978880	987440	Their behavior can look classical to her. But she's not able to determine that their
987440	992640	behavior is classical because she can't measure Bob's entanglement entropy.
994480	1002080	She can't measure the dimension of her own boundary. And recall from a couple of times ago
1002160	1009440	that the boundary includes some sector that supplies free energy that Alice can't extract
1009440	1014080	information from for further processing. She can only extract free energy from.
1015040	1021920	So she can't measure the dimension of that sector. And so she can't measure the dimension of the
1021920	1027760	whole boundary itself. And this of course means that she can't measure her own dimension either.
1027760	1032960	And of course she can't measure Bob's dimension because the only information she can get about
1032960	1038480	Bob is the classical information that's encoded on this boundary. She can't reach past the boundary
1038480	1046320	to see how large a system Bob is. And that's clearly connected to this first point that she
1046320	1051760	can't measure the entanglement entropy across Bob because the entanglement entropy can only be small
1052480	1057360	if her dimension and Bob's dimension are both much larger than the dimension of the boundary.
1057360	1065360	So that's a condition she can't check. So all of these kind of no-go theorems lead off an interesting
1065360	1073920	direction. And the only one that we're really going to be interested in here is the third one,
1073920	1079520	the one about measuring Bob's entanglement entropy because we want to talk specifically about how
1080080	1087600	multiple agents, so multiple components of Alice, can access information about Bob's entanglement
1087600	1099360	entropy. Okay, so recall from the end of the last session that the last thing we talked about was
1099360	1106240	classical communication. And we talked about the fact that classical communication involves
1106240	1111280	assumptions and pitfalls and that we have to be very careful whenever we talk about it.
1112480	1118880	And what we're going to do today is standard practice in physics. We're simply going to stipulate
1119760	1126720	that of these components, A1 and A2, the separable components of Alice communicate
1126720	1131040	classically. And so we're going to draw out like this. We're going to draw a classical channel
1131040	1137760	between them. And that classical channel passes through Bob. It uses degrees of freedom of the
1137760	1144800	ambient photon field or the ambient atmosphere or pieces of paper or email or something like that
1145360	1151360	that's out there in the environment to exchange classical messages. And there are a couple of
1151360	1156960	things to note here. I haven't even written down here. We're assuming that A1 and A2 share some
1156960	1161840	language for this classical communication. That's a big assumption as we talked about last time.
1163840	1170240	But I will note explicitly that classical communication takes time. That's what defines
1170240	1175760	classicality here. It's causal. So it can't work faster than the speed of light.
1177040	1182480	This is a topological theory. We don't have an embedding geometry. So we can't at this point
1182480	1188640	talk about light, which is a relationship between space and time. Because we've got time,
1188640	1195600	we've got clocks, but we don't have any space. But we can say that whatever passes through
1195600	1204560	this classical channel requires at least one clock tick on Bob's side. So it's a process that
1204560	1214160	Bob has to execute. And executing that process takes time. So getting the signal from me to you
1214160	1219920	on the internet takes some time. So the environment's clock has to tick during that.
1221120	1228320	And all of these assumptions bundled together turn out to be a fairly serious set of assumptions.
1228800	1234800	And they involve assumptions about fine tuning, about the universe being just right.
1236400	1243360	And they should make us nervous. And I just want to leave it at that. We always assume
1243360	1248800	with complete aplomb that agents can communicate classically, but it's not a straightforward
1248800	1255200	assumption. And it's worth any of you are looking at, for interesting research projects,
1255200	1260640	can look into the nature of classical communication. It's full of hidden assumptions
1260640	1265600	and surprises and things that aren't at all straightforward, even though they look like
1265600	1272000	they ought to be. So there's a challenge. So why do we assume this? Why do we assume
1272000	1277840	classical communication? We do it because we have to, if we're going to talk about detecting
1277840	1287760	entanglement. And most of you probably know the history of the notion of entanglement.
1287760	1295840	It was first noticed by Einstein, Podolski, and Rosen ever after called EPR in 1935.
1296640	1304400	And they wrote a paper, which is infamous and called the EPR paper, in which they argued that
1304400	1308960	the phenomenon of entanglement made no sense and couldn't possibly be physical.
1310080	1318000	And since quantum theory included this notion of entanglement, it couldn't possibly be a complete
1318000	1325520	theory of what's going on in the world. And Schrodinger replied the same year with a very
1325520	1331200	detailed paper where he introduces among other things Schrodinger's cat as a paradox.
1332160	1337920	And he explains very clearly what entanglement is and why entanglement follows from quantum theory.
1338720	1345040	And he uses that discussion to argue that the classical notion of a physical state is not
1345040	1350640	actually applicable to the world as it is. So he answers the EPR paper very directly.
1351120	1363600	And this discussion is currently mostly known as the Bohr-Einstein debate because of course Bohr,
1364480	1371680	already in 1928, has said in print that the classical notion of causality in space and time
1371680	1379520	simply doesn't apply anymore. And Einstein objected to that vigorously. But that was 1935.
1380160	1385360	And it was almost 50 years later that entanglement was first observed in the laboratory. Here,
1385360	1392640	the 1982 picture is a picture of the interior of Alan Asbest laboratory when he performed
1392640	1397600	the first entanglement experiment for which he finally won the Nobel Prize last year.
1399840	1407360	And these days, this kind of experiment is done all over the world and is even done with
1407360	1417840	satellite-borne sources. Potential resource is the key to quantum security, quantum
1417840	1424400	security communication, as we'll discuss in quantum cryptography and quantum banking,
1424400	1427920	the quantum internet, all this other stuff that you may have heard of.
1428320	1440160	So before talking more about these experiments, I just want to provide a definition of entanglement.
1442320	1450720	Entangled simply means not separable. That's the definition. So a state, a joint state,
1450720	1459040	a b is entangled if and only if it does not factor into two separable states.
1460400	1469280	And that's it. That's the definition. And the literature and especially the popular literature
1469280	1476080	are, is absolutely rife with hype and various kinds of misjurification of entanglement. And
1476960	1484080	authors trying to convince you that entanglement is this amazing kind of woo-woo thing.
1485280	1491920	And whenever you run across that, go back to the definition. I mean, entanglement simply means
1492880	1500240	this simple mathematical condition of not separability or a state that isn't factorizable.
1501200	1505840	And that means that the state does not display classical conditional independence.
1506560	1511440	So classically, that's the way to think about it. It's a failure of conditional independence.
1512240	1517360	And it's ubiquitous in quantum theory, even though it wasn't actually hipster for almost
1517360	1524640	50 years after it was predicted. So here's what all these experiments look like. They're called
1524640	1533680	Bell EPR experiments after John Bell, who derived the statistical criterion for detecting entanglement.
1534480	1540560	And EPR, Einstein, Podolski, and Rosen, who did this as a thought experiment and said,
1540560	1545440	if this occurs in the theory, it can't possibly be real. And of course, it is real.
1546320	1551680	It's now amply demonstrated by experimentation. Here's how they work. There's a source.
1552640	1561600	The source produces a state that is entangled. And I've written the typical what's called a Bell state.
1562160	1567280	It's up plus or minus down divided by the square root of 2, just to normalize it.
1568080	1575200	But up plus or minus down is clearly not the same as up times down. So this is not a separable state.
1575520	1582800	And this state propagates outward in space and time to two observers who have independent laboratories,
1583680	1588960	for example, on different continents in that space-based experiment that I showed you the picture
1588960	1596720	of from the cover of Science a few years ago, 2017, I think. The two observers have freedom
1596720	1603360	to choose their own reference frame, their own z-axis for measuring spin. They do a spin measurement,
1604240	1610640	and they do this over and over and over again. They accumulate statistics, and they exchange their
1610640	1617680	results so that they can analyze the joint statistics of their experiment, and they check to see
1617680	1623760	whether that joint statistics is consistent with classical probability theory. And if it isn't,
1624720	1633680	to a statistically significant level, then they've been able to detect entanglement.
1634880	1642160	Now, notice that this process requires classical communication. They have to make their independent
1642160	1647360	measurements in their own laboratories, and then they have to exchange results.
1647360	1652000	Or one of them has to send results to the other one, or they both have to send their results
1652000	1659680	to some third party. But in all of these cases, they're exchanging some classical data, and so we
1659680	1665920	have the assumption that whoever gets that classical data knows the language it was recorded in,
1666880	1673120	and so can do a joint analysis. So I'll just show you another picture of this experiment
1673760	1679360	that's in a standard space-time diagram. Here, time is vertical, space is horizontal.
1682000	1688080	The two observers are labeled Alice and Bob. They share a quantum channel
1688640	1692880	that goes from Alice to the source to Bob. That's the entangled state.
1694240	1701280	They do some processing, and then one of them here, Bob, sends the results to Alice,
1701280	1707280	and that's a classical communication. It takes time, and it traverses space.
1707600	1715440	So this step is classical. So this is why we have to assume classical communication to talk about
1716000	1723200	detecting or using entanglement. So now I want to represent this in a different way,
1725840	1731040	using our little picture earlier. We're going to think of Alice again as two components,
1731040	1738320	A1 and A2. They're separable, so they have to communicate classically. They have a classical
1738320	1744640	channel that goes through Bob, and they also now share some quantum channel. They share an
1744640	1751520	entangled state, and the entangled state, of course, is produced by Bob. The source is part of Bob,
1752480	1758880	and their detectors, if you want to think about it that way, are located on this boundary B,
1759600	1762560	or their interface with the source is on this boundary B,
1763840	1770720	and each of them executes a process that accumulates data from the quantum channel
1770720	1774480	and communicates it to the other observer via the classical channel.
1776000	1782320	Now this picture illustrates what's called a LOC protocol. LOC means local operations
1782320	1789840	in classical communication. So A1 and A2 are each operating locally on their boundary.
1789840	1796560	They're making measurements locally on their boundary, and they're communicating via actions
1796560	1801920	locally on their boundary and observations locally on their boundary. So for example,
1803520	1810400	I'm communicating with my computer here, we can consider it my boundary, and stuff is happening
1810400	1816960	in the environment that's implemented by the internet, and you're receiving those communications
1817680	1822560	locally on your boundary, on your laptop, or whatever it is you're using.
1823360	1831040	So that's what local operations means, and these protocols specifically involve classical
1831040	1837040	communication, and so they're able to detect entanglement. And a Bell EPR experiment is just
1837040	1844720	an example of a LOC protocol. The observers exchange information about how they're going
1844720	1849680	to do their experiments, they're both going to measure the spin, they're going to use independently
1849680	1854560	chosen reference frames, and they're going to look at the output from some agreed upon source.
1856000	1861760	So that's all classically set up, then they actually make their observations, and then
1861760	1867200	they classically communicate the results. So classical communication front and back.
1868960	1879280	LOC protocols are not limited to this sort of Bell EPR sort of setting. We can also represent
1879280	1888960	a scattering experiment as a LOC protocol. So here's a representation of scattering as a LOC
1888960	1898720	protocol, and you can see all I've done is cut that previous boundary out the division between
1898720	1909120	8.1 and 8.2, and I've then extended it in some external time, the time that is
1909520	1919040	counted by Bob's clock, not by Alice's clock, that's what's meant by external, and I've relabeled
1920000	1927840	Alice 2 as Alice 1 at a later time. So now what Alice is doing is communicating with her past self,
1929360	1935920	or A1 is communicating with her future self, and they're each doing something different.
1936480	1944160	A1 is executing a procedure that in the laboratory we call state preparation.
1945520	1952160	She's preparing a state that we'll call N, which is just the initial state of some
1952160	1961120	scattering experiment. So for example, at the LHC, N is some state of two protons that are
1961120	1970320	quartering around the ring at the LHC at close to the speed of light, and Alice then later on
1970320	1978000	at t plus delta t is doing a different kind of quantum process. She's analyzing the data
1978000	1985440	coming out of something like the Atlas detector, which is a multi-particle counter that's located
1985440	1993520	at the LHC. So they share a quantum channel, which is the scattering channel that takes the
1993520	2003120	incoming state and produces the outgoing state, and I recall from the very first session, as Feynman
2003120	2010880	told us, to understand this transition from N to out, we have to integrate over all possible paths
2010880	2019440	that are consistent with conservation of spin-holicity, basically momentum plus spin.
2022080	2026480	All the different spins that are relevant in a high-energy physics experiment,
2026480	2030320	including things like lepton number, which is basically a spin.
2032560	2038720	Now, how do we know? How do we know what we have to conserve? We know what we have to conserve
2038720	2046160	because Alice is doing the experiment, has a classical memory that allows her to remember
2046880	2054960	what she prepared. She can remember that what she did back in the past was set to protons
2054960	2061280	counter-rotating in the LHC, and they had certain energies, and so they had certain momenta,
2061280	2067600	and they were protons, so they had certain spin variables. All of that has to be remembered to
2067600	2077760	make any sense of the output of the detectors, and so to actually come up with a measured state
2077760	2088000	that makes sense. Very often, this memory channel is neglected by physicists, and I'm going to pause
2088000	2096160	here and let Andrew ask a question. Thank you, Chris. Does this imply that every time you have a
2096160	2102640	block channel, the quantum part is like a scattering picture, like a unitary evolution,
2102640	2108640	even in the earlier EPR picture. Is that quantum channel portion always a unitary evolution
2108640	2122560	scattering picture? Thank you. Yes, for essentially the reason that I'll define the classical
2122560	2125680	channel, you're always assuming you have something that's protected from decoherence.
2126160	2135280	By the environment. So, yeah, if you're doing an EPR experiment, you have to assume that you
2135280	2140320	don't have any environmental decoherence between the source and the detectors,
2141600	2148160	and similarly, when you're doing a scattering experiment, you have to make the assumption
2148160	2155600	that the environment is not reaching in there and messing with the outgoing state that you're
2155600	2160320	going to see or reaching in and messing with the incoming state and changing it in some way
2160880	2166320	that re-prepares it in a way that you don't know, that you have no knowledge of.
2167280	2173600	So, yes, you're making a fairly strong anti-decoherence assumption in any of these settings when you're
2173600	2181840	talking about having a quantum channel. Does that answer the question? Yes, thank you.
2181840	2189680	Okay, great. So, we can think of, we can think of LOC, we can think of scattering as LOC.
2193760	2201520	And I just wanted to now emphasize that effectively what LOC is implementing is two
2201520	2208240	parallel memories, a classical memory, which as we said in the case of scattering is memory for
2208240	2216160	preparation. In the EPR case, it's memory for preparation for what the experimental setup is,
2216160	2224240	for what the instructions for doing the experiment are. And we also have a quantum channel,
2224240	2230000	which is effectively another memory. It's something that's extended through time,
2231040	2237600	and again, it's implemented by the environment, implemented by Bob, and it involves Bob's clock
2237680	2247680	ticking. So, whenever we have two memories in parallel, we can construct an error-correcting
2247680	2254800	code. So, think of a simple classical error-correcting code, for example, the use of parity bits
2256160	2264000	in exchanging digital data. So, if I send you a bit string, classically, and I send it to you
2264000	2271760	two or three times, so there's some redundancy in my signal, and I send you a parity bit.
2272480	2278720	I say, okay, add up your bit string, and the result should be one. It's one on my side.
2279840	2285840	If you've added up and you get zero, there's an error someplace. You can use that parity bit to
2285840	2293280	detect errors. So, you can throw out the bit strings that you receive that have parity as zero
2294000	2299920	and say, oh, the environment interfered somehow with the signal, or some eavesdropper interfered
2299920	2303920	with the signal and made a mistake, or something like that. So, this corresponds
2305920	2311120	to environmental decoherence not being a good assumption, even though it's classical. Environmental
2311120	2317920	interference is not a good assumption in this case. So, a quantum error-correcting code is
2317920	2326160	basically the same idea. I use some feature of the fact that I have two different memories,
2327520	2337600	and that I'm encoding something in time, I'm encoding multiple replicates of something in time,
2337840	2344720	to provide a way of checking to make sure that I'm sending the correct message.
2346640	2354240	So, I can, for example, consider the message to be my classical memory,
2355520	2363520	and consider the quantum process as a process that tests that memory. So, I remember that I
2363520	2372560	need to do experiment X, and I will get result Y. I actually do experiment X on this quantum channel
2372560	2381280	and see if I get result Y. And if I don't get result Y, then something's wrong. Either I can't
2381280	2390320	trust the quantum channel, or I've remembered my preparation conditions incorrectly. So, I'm
2390320	2396560	using one memory to check the accuracy of the other. And this problem
2398960	2404960	of using something about the environment, some channel in the environment, to check memory
2405920	2413600	is absolutely ubiquitous, and we use it all the time. So, for example, look around your room,
2413840	2421440	and your room hopefully looks more or less the same now that it did at the start of this session.
2423120	2430720	And that's very reassuring. It reassures you that something's not happening in the environment
2430720	2441120	that's dangerous and disturbing. And if you couldn't do that, if your environment was constantly
2441120	2447120	changing, and there was no familiarity about the environment, you wouldn't be able to check your
2447120	2453680	memory. You wouldn't be able to check your sanity. So, even though we don't think about
2454880	2460480	our local environments as effectively an error correcting code, that's exactly how we use it.
2460480	2466560	We use the emerging memory or memory out there in the environment as a way of checking our own
2466560	2476560	memories and assuring that our memory is okay. So, I talked a little bit about quantum security.
2477440	2485280	Here's how quantum security system works. Again, it's a lock protocol. We have some classical
2485360	2494560	signal that can be thought of as a code or a key or a one-time pad, for example,
2495280	2502720	that encodes a way of doing experiments. And once that's been exchanged, assuming it's secure,
2503440	2510720	then we can use the quantum channel to communicate information. And the classical channel has told
2510720	2516320	us what we have to do with that quantum channel. We have to make certain kinds of measurements
2517040	2526160	at, say, particular clock times as measured, and we'll get information sent from the past,
2527600	2537280	from the sender. And the classical channel protects the quantum channel from adversarial agents,
2537280	2544400	because anything that an adversarial agent does to the quantum channel, if some agent
2544400	2549760	tries to eavesdrop, for example, on the quantum channel, they'll disrupt the quantum channel,
2550640	2557920	and the results of our measurement will not be what's expected given the protocol that we run,
2558480	2567200	that we have run. So quantum communication is secured by the fact that interfering with some
2567200	2574480	entangled state actually destroys the state, so it's detectable. We can always know if someone is
2574480	2579840	trying to disrupt our communications, which isn't true if we just have two classical channels.
2581040	2585760	Charlie can always intercept a message and then recreate it, and that's not possible
2586560	2597760	with a quantum channel. So let's refold this diagram so that we've taken the external time
2598480	2606960	back out of it. And we have this picture where the two components of Alice are just interacting
2606960	2613600	via their shared boundary with their environment, Bob. And now we can see that the source of
2613600	2622720	redundancy is not time, it's the boundary itself. Just sharing the boundary allows
2624000	2633520	Alice's components, A1 and A2, to put copies of the same information on different places
2633520	2640400	on the boundary. So the boundary now becomes a resource for redundant storage of information.
2641360	2646640	So Alice 1 and Alice 2 can use different parts of the boundary
2649760	2656560	to check what other parts of the boundary say, to check the information that's encoded on other
2656560	2663680	parts of the boundary. So they can define an error correcting code on the boundary itself
2664400	2679600	using this lock protocol. So I just want to leave you with this idea that using classical and quantum
2680480	2689680	channels together allows us to define error correcting codes on boundaries that we share
2690000	2703280	as separate agents. And leave you to think about what shared measurements, what shared
2703280	2715200	quantum reference frames, let us as agents see the same things. And this is what we'll talk about
2716000	2726000	next time in September. We'll talk specifically about how space provides us with an error correcting
2726000	2737280	code and try to understand why space is treated as emergent from something else, basically,
2737360	2746000	from communication in most of quantum gravity. So thank you very much. I encourage you to use
2746000	2753360	the interactive QA and to attend the discussion sessions and we'll see you in September. Thank you.
2754320	2768720	Awesome. Chris, thank you for the lecture. Andrew, do you have any remarks or questions?
2769920	2776880	Not right now. Thank you. I'll just ask a few quick questions and if anyone has one quickly
2776880	2784400	in the live chat. So you mentioned the tick of the clock and in active inference, we often hold
2784400	2791040	up side by side both the discrete time models and the continuous time models. So do clocks have to
2791040	2800880	tick discreetly or how do we think about continuous time modeling? In this in this quantum setting,
2800960	2806240	they do have to tick discreetly because one has to be able to distinguish
2808000	2813600	Alice's preparation of the qubits on her boundary from Bob's measurements of the
2814480	2825440	qubits on the boundary. And this process can be extremely fast with respect to any kind of sense
2825440	2834560	of macroscopic time. You know, your eyes are responding to photons in I think it's hundreds
2834560	2845440	of femtoseconds. So the discrete transitions that are effectively time measurements for you
2846560	2853280	are at that very fast molecular time scale, much, much faster than our typical clocks.
2856400	2861440	When we try to do very fast timing, we're constructing a faster clock than that,
2862080	2865440	but it's a clock that we can only observe indirectly.
2870720	2877680	Awesome. Okay. Now this one maybe connects a little bit to application, but with all the
2877680	2884320	developments happening in theory, some of which you're reviewing here, and also in practice with
2884320	2891920	quantum computation, and then keeping in mind this distinction. Sorry, I've lost you. Back.
2897360	2904160	I've lost you, Daniel. Okay, we'll wait till you're back. I can see you. No. Okay. Yeah,
2904160	2911280	just repeat your question, please. Yeah, so given these rapid and ongoing developments in
2911280	2916480	theory and practice related to quantum information science and quantum information security,
2917440	2925120	how are people using this distinction of the classical Stigmergic memory and then the
2925120	2929040	quantum cognitive process to anticipate
2931600	2936960	how to develop information systems that are reliable going forward?
2937520	2950880	I don't know of any instances in which thinking about quantum cognition has entered directly into
2950880	2960240	any design of communication systems. The ability of humans to interact with these systems is just
2960240	2969120	assumed. So it's just assumed that the user can interact with, say, a computer interface,
2970720	2976640	which is the sort of interface that will be provided or is provided to any quantum computer.
2977200	2983920	So if you think about a quantum computer, a practical quantum computer, it has classical
2983920	2993440	interfaces front and back. So in thinking about interacting with the computer, I'm giving it some
2993440	2999760	classical problem statement, for example, and asking for some classical answer. And what it's
2999760	3006880	going to give me is a probability distribution of classical answers. But I can, by running the
3006880	3011040	calculation many times, make that probability distribution fairly tight.
3015600	3022160	So yeah, I don't know of anyone talking about quantum BCIs at this point. It'd be an interesting
3022160	3034640	question. Was it always understood these sorts of blind spots and axioms associated with classical
3035280	3045680	communication? Was it developed as kind of like a proposal or like a special case? And more unpacking
3045680	3050640	was left for later? Or are these blind spots things that we're now coming into awareness of,
3050640	3053760	given what we're learning in the quantum information sciences?
3055920	3062560	I think we're learning how serious they are. But they were certainly recognized even by Bohr
3062560	3072880	in his 1928 paper. And that's a very good paper, too. It's called the present state of quantum
3072880	3078960	theory or something like that, and it's in nature. And it's available on the web somewhere.
3080720	3089280	I have a copy of it. But it was written, in a sense, as Bohr's summary of the 1927 Solvay
3089280	3094480	conference, which was the conference at which everyone doing quantum theory at that time
3095200	3105040	got together to talk about their results. And in it, Bohr essentially presents what came to be
3105040	3116400	the Copenhagen interpretation, which I think is probably unfairly called an interpretation.
3116400	3126640	And it's sort of the Copenhagen pragmatic stance toward quantum theory. And essentially what Bohr
3126640	3136880	says is that if we're going to do science, we have to assume that people can talk to each other.
3138640	3144960	And if we're going to do science, we have to assume that there are instruments that we can
3144960	3153120	manipulate and have reasonable confidence that we know what manipulation we've done. So if I turn
3153120	3159920	a knob from one to two, I have to be reasonably confident that I'm making a particular change
3159920	3169280	that I can understand. And we have to have reasonable confidence that different laboratories can
3169280	3175920	replicate the same experiment. And if we think about any of those assumptions in purely quantum
3175920	3183680	theoretic terms, then all sorts of questions are raised, right? Every quantum system is unique.
3184400	3191600	We have the no cloning theorem. So every scientific instrument is unique. So there's no such thing as
3192560	3199680	exactly replicating an experiment, right? That's a coarse-grained description of what I've done
3199680	3207520	with a completely unique quantum system. And my brain, of course, is unique. And yours is too,
3207520	3216480	and everyone else's is. So talking about a sharing a language is essentially a coarse-grained assumption.
3216800	3224800	And what the Copenhagen stance is all about is coarse-graining, yielding, effective classicality.
3224800	3232160	Or what that really means is coarse-graining, yielding, a description that we can use in
3232160	3240800	the language that we understand. So these are very, very old issues that have been recognized for a
3241440	3247760	long time. But I think, in part, because of the disaster of shut up and calculate,
3249600	3251840	they haven't really been talked about in the classroom.
3255040	3260400	Awesome. I'll just read short questions from the chat. We can just, we can pass them to the
3260400	3265440	discussion section, but there's a lot of great diverse questions. So Alexi wrote.
3266000	3269680	I think I've lost you again. The Revenge of Zoom.
3270400	3275040	Well, we looked at the chart earlier where like Bob was talking to Alice,
3276160	3278400	the unidirectional communication. Okay, good.
3280080	3285120	Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. The unidirectional. The third party is recording it, I'm sure.
3286400	3293840	Alexi wrote regarding the environment for being used for error correction. A symptom of
3293840	3300720	derealization in psychological trauma breakdown. We don't recognize the environment around us and
3300720	3310720	it's scary. Makes sense. Makes sense. All right. From Bala. Nice presentation. I heard Chris say,
3311360	3317920	entangled states are LOCC for a specific reference frame. Is this entanglement unitary or
3318640	3321200	is it related to the numbers of degrees of freedom?
3324720	3335440	I think the quick answer would be both. If you have a complex system with many
3335440	3343920	degrees of freedom, some can be entangled while others aren't. It depends on what parts of the
3343920	3349920	state are separable. So again, entanglement is just a statement about
3350880	3357040	components of a joint state that factor or don't.
3359760	3364240	So you can have a joint state that looks separable along some dimensions, but
3366800	3370320	other dimensions. The other big complication here is that
3371040	3376640	whether a state looks entangled depends on the reference frames that you use to measure it with.
3376640	3386400	And if you pick entangled reference frames, then what we ordinarily think of as separable
3386400	3390880	does entangled states become separable. So you can move entanglement around.
3393840	3400560	Awesome. Okay. From Roland Rodriguez. Is the discrete temporality only within the context
3400560	3406000	of a given holographic screen interface? With time being bracketed otherwise,
3406000	3410880	beyond interface systems is continuity or discretion kept agnostic?
3414880	3423040	I think if I understand the question correctly, it's yes. If I don't draw any boundaries,
3423760	3433760	I just have the joint state, then the evolution is unitary. And in a sense, time plays no role.
3435040	3443520	And if unitary evolution is perfectly time symmetric, so time actually drops out altogether.
3446000	3448320	Awesome. So to talk about time, we have to draw boundaries.
3449280	3457440	Awesome. Time must have a stop. And I'll ask one last question from the appropriately
3457440	3464880	monocled question quanderer. All communication is abductive. Is a sentiment that I've been
3464880	3471280	using to develop some arguments? Does that scan for you? How do we connect what we're discussing
3471280	3484000	here with quantum to abductive logic? Yeah. I could go along with that. I want a lot more detail.
3486800	3491920	All communication is essentially analogical. I would agree with that. Yes.
3491920	3502960	Andrew? Yes, thank you. So going back to the picture where the scattering picture,
3504400	3511920	so we have so far everything is topological and certainly induces breaking the boundary
3511920	3517920	in different sectors. I suppose it induces a topology on the boundary. Now, I have a couple
3517920	3526000	questions asked for the geometry, and this might be getting ahead. Is it an emerging property of
3526000	3531840	those channels between different boundary sectors? And if that's the case, then what does it mean to
3531840	3546160	have a QRF for space? Yeah, this is really the topic for September. But you do point out the
3546160	3554560	fact that it's something of a chicken and egg situation. The way I think of it is I suppose
3554560	3564720	to choose the chicken side and think about what kind of reference frame does the agent have to
3564720	3575600	implement to see space on their boundary? And the reason I think about it that way is
3575600	3581280	that's a question I want to be able to ask about biological systems. And this actually gets into
3582160	3589520	probably what won't be talked about until October. But I want to be able to ask
3592320	3599600	essentially a phylogenetic question of what sorts of organisms, where in the lineage from Luca,
3599600	3608560	do we find systems that are able to assign spatial coordinates to their boundaries?
3608560	3620080	And what coordinates come first? And I suspect that sort of discrete location names with no metric
3620080	3628160	come first. That a system can talk about, for example, this part of their membrane versus
3628160	3633600	that part of their membrane without even having any ability to say how far apart they are.
3635680	3640320	That some sort of metric representation of this angular space comes later.
3642160	3650240	And that a radial space comes even later than that. That's at this point speculation. But I
3650240	3655920	think these are questions that we can end up asking given the right kind of formalism
3656880	3661920	and the right understanding of what it means to be able to make a spatial measurement.
3663280	3669680	So the conjecture is that the metric would emerge from a discrete network metric of counting ticks
3669680	3678480	sort of thing? Yeah, I think that's correct. And the sort of cemeteries of space that we see
3679440	3687760	are very much tied up with object identity. So if we think about something like rotational symmetry,
3687760	3695680	let's see. I should stop screen sharing.
3698720	3706320	So I've got this object, right? And I can do this and I say, oh, the space has this rotational
3706320	3712480	symmetry. But for me to say that, I have to recognize that this is the same object, right?
3712480	3719200	I have to implement object persistence, which we all learn to do when we're nine months old or
3719200	3729520	something. But we tend to regard those as separate things as, you know, we learn object persistence
3729520	3735280	because space is rotationally symmetric. But we can view it the other way around that space is
3735280	3742000	rotationally symmetric for me, because I implement these constraints that are called object persistence.
3745040	3752000	Do you think we can understand phylogenetics as a whole, as a kind of scattering experiment,
3752000	3760720	like the high energy Luca event, and then dissipating and propagating in a very tangled bank?
3761600	3769440	Well, I do want to be able to understand phylogeny in exactly the same terms as embryology.
3770240	3774400	And Mike Levin and I have published papers about that. We should be able to view the
3774400	3781520	lineage of Luca in exactly the same way that, you know, we view the lineage of the zygote that produced us.
3782080	3790960	So that's why it's no coincidence that during pregnancy, the development of the embryo
3790960	3794880	mirrors evolution in terms of the parts that are developed first?
3796880	3803360	Yeah, this is the old idea that phylogenia and ontogenia are related in some way,
3803920	3810320	which from an embryonic development point of view, they're certainly analogous in ways.
3812240	3816480	And sorry, if I may ask one last question, I think it should be very quick.
3817680	3822480	Regarding the weak rotation, I'm still a bit unsure of how it ties to this
3823600	3828080	diagrammatic notation that we had with quantum channels and so on.
3829600	3835200	And there was a note in the second session, we briefly talked about the weak rotation,
3836160	3842480	you know, being a reversal in the direction of time. Is there any relation to today's session?
3845920	3858480	Yeah, whenever we think about the flow of time as driven by the input output cycle,
3859200	3868400	the input output cycle for agents separated by a boundary is always, there's always a sign
3868400	3877120	change, right? My input is your output and vice versa. So when we think about the
3877200	3890480	Bob's clock ticking when Alice does something, his direction of time, in a sense,
3890480	3894240	points with respect to the boundary opposite to hers.
3896880	3903520	But that's only with respect to the boundary. He sees information flowing in and she sees
3903520	3912080	information flowing in. That's the only point being made here about the weak rotation as an
3912080	3924080	operation. Thank you, Chris. Very well appreciated by the viewers and by us. So we'll certainly
3924080	3931680	look forward to reviewing the Q&A and everybody is welcome and encouraged to join for the
3931680	3937840	participatory discussion in about two weeks on Saturday. So till next time.
3938960	3941680	All right. Thank you. Cheers.
3961680	3963060	you
