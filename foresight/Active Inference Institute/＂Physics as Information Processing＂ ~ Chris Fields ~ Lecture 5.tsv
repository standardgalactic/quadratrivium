0	14040	Hello and welcome, everyone. It is September 14, 2023. And we are in the course, Physics
14040	20200	as Information Processing. It's lecture five. Looking forward to this lecture, and then
20200	23600	a little conversation, Chris, off to you. Thank you.
24600	32600	Okay. Thank you, Daniel. And welcome to session five of Physics of Information Processing.
32600	42600	And today we're going to talk about space time. And particularly about the idea that
42600	51600	space time is emergent from information processing. And this has now become a very mainstream idea
51600	59600	in the quantum information and quantum gravity communities. And there's still, of course,
59600	67600	some people holding out for the idea that space time is fundamental. But I would say that
67600	77600	at least in these communities, I expect it's become now the dominant idea that space time
77600	87600	is not fundamental, that space time is not part of the basic ontology of reality or something
87600	96600	like that. And that, instead, space time is a construct. So that's what today's session is going
96600	107600	to be about. So for those of you who are just joining or who would like a little review, we
107600	115600	started this course talking about quantum information theory. And the idea that quantum
115600	123600	information theory is actually a new science about systems that communicate across a boundary.
123600	133600	And the systems are always called Alice and Bob for kind of historical reasons. And emphasize
133600	141600	that this new science is topological. It's about connectivity between systems. It's not
141600	149600	geometric. So it doesn't assume a space time embedding. So it leaves open the possibility
149600	159600	that space time is actually a construct. It doesn't assume space time up front. And in
159600	166600	the second session of the course, I think we talked about how this boundary could always
166600	173600	be represented as an array of qubits and that what the systems on each side of the boundary
173600	180600	do to communicate is prepare and then measure the states of these qubits. So they communicate
180600	195600	by exchanging classical information via a quantum channel. And this introduces a particular kind
195600	203600	of quantum noise whenever they don't share the reference frames that they use to prepare the
203600	212600	bits and measure the bits. So it's not necessarily a perfect communication channel from a classical
212600	219600	fidelity point of view. But all of the noise is quantum noise. It's not classical. And it always
219600	226600	derives from differences in the reference frames that are used by the two agents. We
226600	234600	reformulated the free energy principle in this setting. And the free energy principle turns out
234600	241600	to be very simple. It turns out to be a classical limit of the principle of uniterity, which is just
241600	250600	the principle that information is conserved. And we saw that the approach to perfect alignment
250600	257600	between the two agents or perfect prediction on the part of the two agents becomes more
257600	264600	challenging, not surprisingly, as system complexity increases. So the more complex the
264600	272600	communication, the harder it is to predict, as one would expect. In the last session, we talked
272600	283600	about how constraints on thermodynamic free energy induce compartmentalization in agents. So
283600	294600	whenever agents interact with their environments in fairly complex ways, then they end up being
294600	301600	compartmentalized into compartments that have to communicate classically. And this is solely
301600	308600	a result of quantum information theory. You don't have to assume any biology to get this
308600	314600	compartmentalization. But clearly, this is something that we see in biological systems. Not
314600	323600	only do we see compartments, we also see hierarchical control, which is likewise a sort of
323600	333600	automatic outcome of the theory for complex systems. And finally, last time, we talked a
333600	341600	little bit about how these compartments communicate and introduce the idea of communication
341600	349600	protocols that involve local operations on a shared quantum resource of some kind, and
349600	357600	classical communication. And we talked to Fermat about how classical communication is a
357600	365600	little bit problematic to define in quantum theory because, of course, you're introducing
365600	373600	classicality. And so you have to make some very specific assumptions about what's classical. And
373600	384600	we'll see later on today what the key assumption that gives you classicality is as we talk about
384600	395600	spacetime. But before I go into the topic of spacetime, I want to spend a little time...
395600	402600	OK, so this, sorry, this is where we're going. We're talking about spacetime, and we'll talk
402600	409600	about applications to biology next time. But before we get going on this, I want to spend
409600	419600	a little bit of time talking about explanation. And this is motivated by a question that came
419600	425600	up, a very long question that touched on many different topics that came up in the interactive
425600	437600	Q&A last time. And a fair amount of that question had to do with, directly or indirectly, the
437600	447600	question of what scale-free explanation looks like and how it compares to scientific explanation
447600	456600	in general, most of which is reductive. So I want to make a short detour into the question
456600	464600	of how reductionist theories, which all of you are probably very familiar with, relate to
464600	472600	scale-free theories. And particularly, the free energy principle is a scale-free theory.
472600	482600	So it's a theory that's unlike most of the theories that most of you probably learned about
482600	492600	in college. So we're all familiar with reductionist theories and the reductionist idea of scientific
492600	500600	explanation, which is really an outcome of philosophy of science in the 20s and 30s. People
500600	508600	like Rudolph Carnap were among the first to actually make precise what this idea of reductive
508600	520600	explanation is. But the basic idea is that the laws or the dynamics or the formalism that
520600	529600	describes behavior at some micro scale, the behavior of little things, actually explains
529600	539600	the behavior of big things. So the basic reductionist idea is that what the little things are doing
539600	549600	is what's important. And what big things are doing are either emergent phenomena or they're
549600	557600	just epiphenomenal. They're essentially just appearances. And this defines a fundamental
557600	564600	scale. So the real assumption in any reductionist theory is that there's some fundamental scale
564600	572600	at which the real dynamics takes place and everything else is just an appearance or some sort
572600	580600	of emergent phenomenon. And I try to be very careful when I use the word emergence because
580600	585600	it's one of the most ambiguous words in the philosophy of science and people use it to mean
585600	595600	all sorts of different things. But whenever you say emergent, it always sort of implies the idea
595600	605600	that it's emergent from something. And so the idea of emergence is essentially a reductionist idea
605600	615600	because it at least implicitly assumes that there's some micro scale from which the macro scale is
615600	626600	emergent. And so the discussions of emergent phenomena are offered very consistent with
626600	638600	reductionism even if they claim not to be. And we're all taught that science is reductionist.
639600	646600	And there are certainly people who publicly claim that science is reductionist. Richard Dawkins
646600	654600	is certainly a shining example of this. But I suspect that a lot of scientists just kind of pay
654600	661600	play lip service to reductionism without really believing in it because they don't really believe
661600	669600	that the macroscopic phenomena that they are studying, life, for example, is completely determined
669600	677600	by what's going on at the micro scale or what's going on at the micro scale plus some stochastic
677600	687600	noise or something like that. So I want to explicitly contrast this with a scale free theory.
687600	697600	In a scale free theory is not simply a holistic theory. It's much more precise. In a scale free
697600	706600	theory, little things and big things obey the same laws or they have the same dynamics where
706600	713600	they're described by the same formalism. So it's not that the macro scale is emergent from the
713600	722600	micro scale. The macro scale and the micro scale actually obey the same laws. And the
722600	732600	relationship between macro and micro is probably best stated as what implementation of macro
732600	739600	scale things have micro scale components and those micro scale components are doing something
739600	751600	or other and whatever they're doing implements the macro scale system and its behavior. But this
751600	762600	implementation is not an explanation or at least it's not an explanation all by itself. And the
762600	768600	bumper sticker version of scale free theories is just as above so below. Whatever laws you have at the
768600	775600	macro scale are the ones the same ones you have at the micro scale and vice versa. So scale free
775600	784600	theories in a sense are simple. It's the same theory at every level of description. So what is this
784600	793600	idea of scale? And how does it relate to what we've talked about in this course? Well, what we've
793600	800600	talked about in this course all has to do with what an agent can observe on its boundary. So scale
800600	808600	has to do with how information is encoded on the boundary. And we can describe that scale in many
808600	817600	different ways. Here's a commonplace way to describe it in physics by a relationship between
817600	829600	energy and distance or size. And you've probably all heard of the Planck scale. The Planck scale is
829600	840600	the smallest scale at which current physics makes any sense. And in energetic terms, it's defined by
840600	851600	energies on the order of 10 to the 19th GEV, which is gigo electron volts. The LHC, the Large Hadron
851600	861600	Collider in Switzerland, gets to about 10 to the 4th GEV. So many, many orders of magnitude less than the Planck
861600	871600	scale. So the Planck scale is extremely energetic compared to what we can probe experimentally. The Planck
871600	881600	scale energy of 10 to the 9th GEV corresponds to a distance of about 10 to the minus 35 meters, which is
881600	891600	incredibly tiny. An intermediate scale on this diagram is about the scale of a nucleon. So, for example, a
891600	901600	proton or a neutron, they have a rest mass of about one GEV and a size of about one femtometer. So this
901600	911600	intermediate scale is roughly the scale of nuclear physics. And then if you go to our scale, the scale of
911600	922600	things that are about a meter in size, human beings, tables and chairs, lots of animals, the things we're most
922600	930600	familiar with, that corresponds to an incredibly tiny energy. 10 to the minus 5 electron volts is about the energy of a
930600	947600	photon of radiation. And a meter is about the wavelength of long-wave radio. So if you think about visible light, it has a
947600	954600	wavelength of about 10 to the minus 5 meters and energy of about an electron volt. So it's not surprising that visible light
954600	964600	feels energetic to us because it's orders of magnitude above our natural scale of energy of this sort of thermal
964600	981600	environment in which we exist. So it's the encoding scale on the boundary that is going to relate theories of things that we
981600	992600	see to each other. And this ends up giving a kind of complicated picture. If you think of Alice interacting with Bob and measuring
992600	1004600	things on the boundary. Sorry, I'm a little bit ahead of myself. I just wanted to show you a picture of a reductive theory.
1004600	1014600	This is the Big Bang. You're all familiar with this. Something happens at the Planck scale and the entire universe results from it by
1014600	1025600	just a scale change. So this is a reductive theory. A scale-free theory is much more complicated. So here's what a scale-free
1025600	1040600	theory looks like. Alice interacts with Bob and she's looking at her boundary. And her boundary states, the boundary states she sees could be
1040600	1053600	encoded at different scales. So there may be a small scale, scale one, and a bigger scale, scale two. And what Alice is looking for is some
1053600	1066600	reductive theory that relates the first scale, the micro-scale, to the macro-scale. And so it's not that the micro-scale came first, like it
1066600	1077600	did in the Big Bang, and the macro-scale came later. These are encodings that can be happening simultaneously. And the theoretical
1077600	1089600	task is to find theories that relate between these scales. And these are implementation theories, or you might call them embedding theories from one
1089600	1101600	scale into another. And what we want as a consistency criterion is for these theories to be constant in time. So as Bob evolves in
1101600	1112600	time, and so what Alice sees are these encodings on her boundary, she wants the relationship between encodings at different scales to stay
1112600	1122600	constant. Because if it doesn't, she'll never be able to figure anything out. She'll just have this chaotic relationship between things happening at
1122600	1137600	different scales, and nothing will make sense. So you have this complicated picture in scale-free theories. And if you look at this, and it seems vaguely
1137600	1152600	familiar, or even vaguely, even very familiar, then it should. Because this is exactly the kind of explanatory structure or semantic structure that you
1152600	1162600	have in computer science. If you're studying the behavior of a computer, which is just some piece of hardware, some physical
1162600	1174600	system, then you can describe what that piece of hardware is doing at different scales. And in fact, what we call the hardware level of
1174600	1186600	description, when we talk about, you know, our laptops, for example, is typically the level of description of circuits of transistors inside
1186600	1196600	microprocessors. We think of that as the hardware level. But of course, that's just a description, too, that's layered on top of lots of much smaller scale
1196600	1212600	dynamics, all the way down to the scale of atoms and eventually nuclei and elementary particles and all that other stuff. So there's some quantum stuff that's going on that we
1212600	1227600	describe as having a classical hardware level of bit exchange. And then we describe the behavior of programs on top of that. So what we want, what makes a
1227600	1245600	computer useful is that we can assign semantics to programs. And we can talk about semantic relationships between programs, for example, the relationship between the internet
1246600	1264600	protocols, stuff that zoom is doing, and what you actually see on your user interface and here on your user interface, that needs to stay fixed over time, or zoom becomes incomprehensible and not programmable and in fact
1265600	1280600	not even well defined as an algorithmic system. And the same is true for the relationship between the operating system and the hardware description, or between the operating system and zoom is a program. So computer
1280600	1299600	science works in exactly this scale free way. And so in a sense, scale free explanation is very familiar. It's exactly the kind of explanation that we have in computer science. And that's why I refer to the relationship
1299600	1321600	between scales as one of implementation, because that's a term that we're familiar with from thinking about computers implementing programs. So what are these theories, and if we think in biological terms, we can think of pathways
1321600	1342600	embedded in a cell, or cells being embedded in tissues, all the way up to niches of various kinds, which may be social niches, being embedded in ecosystems and ecosystems being embedded in the biosphere. And so we have all of these essentially semantic
1342600	1363600	theories that talk about how one scale embeds in another scale. And if we have these sorts of scale transitions, we can think of representing the relationship between transitions at different scales, in terms of the activity of some kind of
1363600	1389600	renormalization group, which is transforming entities and processes at one scale into entities and processes at another scale. And I think in biology, we can at least put forward the hypothesis that in all the way from pathways
1389600	1409600	embedding in cells to ecosystems embedding in the biosphere, we could put forward the hypothesis at least that the renormalization group flow across all of these scales is trivial. That is that the embedding theories all have the same formal structure.
1410600	1434600	The structure that describes how pathways embed into cells is the same structure that describes how ecosystems embed into the biosphere. Now I certainly can't prove that. I believe that it's likely.
1435600	1445600	So I think it's an interesting hypothesis to investigate. And this is an hypothesis that I want to leave you with.
1446600	1449600	As a result of this class is something to think about.
1451600	1461600	To what extent, in thinking about biological systems or even social systems are the embedding theories the same.
1462600	1479600	So in thinking this way that the physics of the situation is has the same formal structure as computer science has in terms of explanation.
1480600	1489600	Oh, we're of course faced with a problem, which is that we're not just reconstructing physics.
1490600	1497600	We're talking about the physics of of interacting observers. We're talking about the physics of communication.
1498600	1503600	So we're modeling how we do physics.
1504600	1507600	And that makes our theory self referential.
1508600	1520600	And so we have to base the music from Gertl's theorem, which tells us essentially that powerful self referential theories can't be both consistent and complete.
1521600	1528600	And by powerful, I just mean powerful enough to express arithmetic. So not terribly powerful.
1529600	1534600	So this becomes an issue that we have to live with.
1535600	1550600	We will always be faced with this issue of having to construct metatheories, which tell us how our lower level theories work.
1551600	1553600	But we never get to the end of that process.
1553600	1566600	We never can get to theories that are both consistent and complete because our tower of theories becomes progressively actually more powerful as it goes up.
1567600	1573600	So Gertl, in a sense, poses a problem.
1574600	1587600	But in another sense, just tells us what life is like as a scientist that you can't have everything all the time doing science.
1588600	1589600	But we probably all already knew that.
1590600	1612600	So let's now talk about space, end of digression, and see how these ideas apply to a system or a tower of systems that can construct a spatial embedding in its world, in its observed world.
1613600	1625600	So let's start out thinking about a system that can see its environment, but what it sees as a completely uniform environment where nothing is happening.
1628600	1637600	So if you have a uniform environment where nothing is happening, you can't distinguish one part of the environment from another.
1638600	1642600	So you have no sense of space.
1643600	1654600	So what I want to do is build up from scratch what's needed to have a sense of space.
1655600	1661600	And then we'll talk a little bit about what organisms are doing.
1661600	1676600	And I think a very interesting question is, if you look at phylogeny, at what points in phylogeny, what lineages in phylogeny actually need to have a sense of space?
1677600	1685600	And what do they have to have in terms of computational power to have that sense of space?
1686600	1691600	So if you just have a uniform environment, you don't have a sense of space.
1693600	1704600	But the first thing we can do with an environment is to divide it up into some number of parts that are somehow distinguishable.
1706600	1711600	So suppose we can segment the environment into two different parts.
1711600	1720600	And if you think about E. coli, for example, E. coli has a bunch of sensors on the front and a bunch of effectors on the back.
1721600	1728600	So it can sense much more about the front part of the environment than the back part of the environment.
1729600	1736600	So already with E. coli, you have this kind of segmentation of the environment into parts.
1737600	1740600	But so far, nothing has happened in this environment.
1740600	1743600	We just have segments that can be distinguished.
1745600	1754600	So let's consider an environment like this that has distinguishable segments.
1755600	1763600	What one next wants to know about these segments is whether they're next to each other.
1764600	1769600	And if we just have a bunch of segments, we just have a set.
1770600	1777600	And a set doesn't have any order or any relationship information.
1778600	1787600	So I've drawn this environment as a rectangle of rectangles, but that's just a representation.
1788600	1794600	And it looks like there are relationships between these rectangles.
1795600	1798600	But if they're just a set, then there are no relationships.
1799600	1803600	If we want to add relationships, then we have to add them explicitly.
1804600	1815600	So let's add some connections between these different segments of the environment to turn that set into a graph
1815600	1822600	that says explicitly, for example, that the light green segment is attached to the light blue segment.
1823600	1826600	And it's also attached to the dark green segment.
1827600	1833600	And the dark blue segment is attached to the light blue segment and attached to the dark green segment.
1834600	1839600	So now we have something that's much more mathematically complicated than a set.
1840600	1842600	We have a graph that has some connection information.
1842600	1844600	So we have a connection to apology.
1846600	1849600	Now, adding this topology does something very important.
1850600	1855600	It breaks the exchange symmetry that is there if you just have a set.
1856600	1859600	So if we just have a set, it doesn't make any difference.
1860600	1870600	If I exchange, for example, the positions of the upper right light blue segment with the upper left light green segment.
1870600	1875600	But if we have this connection to apology, then it does make a difference.
1876600	1887600	I've twisted the graph around, and if I have to break connections to exchange things, then I've actually changed the topology.
1888600	1900600	So adding a topology, adding connections can disrupt a symmetry that's there if there is no topology.
1901600	1909600	So now let's think about, now we have the structure that's required to think about something happening.
1910600	1923600	So suppose that at some time, as measured in the bit counter time reference frame of the observing system, something happens.
1924600	1926600	So a dot appears in the light green segment.
1927600	1933600	And we can express this actually in the notation of quantum field theory.
1933600	1946600	We can think of the light green segment as a field, and the dot appearing is the occurrence of an excitation in that field.
1947600	1958600	And so we can write this notation that says that the green field was excited to produce a dot, which is up arrow green dot.
1959600	1975600	And some time after that, it may turn out that the dot disappears in the green field, and some sort of dot appears down at the dark blue field.
1976600	1984600	And again, we can write this in this kind of creation and destruction operator notation that one has in quantum field theory.
1985600	1993600	And so this says that the green field is no longer excited, but now the dark blue field is excited.
1994600	2001600	So this doesn't imply anything about these excitations being the same. In fact, they're completely different.
2002600	2007600	One is an excitation of the green field and one is an excitation of the blue field.
2008600	2010600	But at least now something is happening in the environment.
2011600	2022600	So we can think about what does it take for an observer to notice that something is happening in its environment?
2023600	2031600	It has to be able to detect a change occurring in some segment of its environment.
2032600	2041600	And that change can involve something happening or something stopping happening in that segment of its environment.
2042600	2048600	But it doesn't yet have to have any idea of what an object is.
2049600	2070600	But we can add that if the system has a memory, we can have the system connect these events happening in different parts of its environment.
2071600	2081600	So if the system has a memory that has some number of steps, say in steps, but here it could even just be two steps,
2082600	2095600	it can see transitions between these two different states where there's a dot in the green field and then a dot in the dark blue field
2095600	2102600	and then a dot in the green field and then a dot in the dark blue field and then a dot in the green field, etc.
2103600	2111600	So I've expressed this in this sort of field theory notation over on the right side.
2112600	2117600	And what this is is a flip-flop. It's an observed periodic behavior.
2118600	2123600	So this is the basic idea behind a clock.
2124600	2139600	So any observer that can see this, a number of time steps internally, can interpret what's going on in its external environment as a clock ticking.
2140600	2142600	It can see some periodicity.
2142600	2154600	So as long as you can have memory and the ability to detect change, you can see periodic behavior in the environment.
2155600	2158600	So you can see the environment acting like a clock.
2161600	2167600	So let's think a bit about what this does and does not require.
2167600	2176600	So seeing a clock in the environment requires having distinguishable, non-exchangeable sectors of the environment.
2177600	2182600	So you have to have this connection to apology that breaks the exchange symmetry.
2183600	2191600	It requires having these sectors implement some sort of flip-flop, so something periodic happening.
2192600	2196600	And you have to have enough memory to see that periodicity.
2197600	2202600	But it doesn't require any sense of object identity.
2203600	2212600	So the excitation in the green part and the excitation in the blue part can still just be field excitations of the green part and the blue part.
2213600	2218600	There's nothing that says that those have to be the same thing.
2219600	2222600	They just have to appear and disappear in some periodic way.
2224600	2227600	And having a clock doesn't require a metric space.
2228600	2232600	You don't need to have any sense of distance defined on the environment.
2233600	2238600	You just have to have this segmentation that is not rearrangeable.
2239600	2246600	So this tells us something extremely important, which is that time is more fundamental than space.
2247600	2255600	Time in the exterior environment is much simpler and easier to observe than space in the exterior environment.
2256600	2267600	So for thinking biologically about phylogeny, we might expect to see organisms that can detect periodic behavior in the external environment.
2268600	2273600	Long before they can detect spatial organization in the exterior environment.
2274600	2281600	And we know that organisms, even down to microbial mats, can respond to the diurnal cycle.
2282600	2289600	So we know that organisms, in a sense, can detect environmental clocks.
2290600	2296600	Even organisms that we have no reason to believe divide the environment up into spaces,
2297600	2301600	or the sort of space that we're used to, like a Euclidean space.
2303600	2309600	So now we're about adding space to this idea of time in the environment.
2312600	2316600	So the next step is to be able to see motion.
2317600	2326600	And being able to see one thing move from one segment of the environment to another segment,
2327600	2332600	as opposed to something happening in one segment, and then something happens in another segment.
2333600	2341600	One has to have this idea of object persistence, that there's a thing that has an identity,
2342600	2346600	and its identity doesn't change over time.
2347600	2353600	And it doesn't change when you move it someplace else, when it appears someplace else in the environment.
2354600	2356600	It's the same object.
2357600	2364600	So this is an idea that psychologists call object persistence,
2365600	2369600	and it's an idea that physicists call translational invariance.
2370600	2374600	Translational invariance means two things.
2375600	2381600	It means that if I have an object and I move it to a different location, I don't change the object.
2382600	2385600	It's the same object that I move from here to there.
2386600	2388600	So the location doesn't change the object.
2389600	2391600	But it also means the reverse of that.
2392600	2395600	It means that the object doesn't change the location.
2396600	2403600	My container remains invariant, even though I move the object around in it.
2404600	2408600	So these are kind of the two faces of translational invariance,
2409600	2412600	and they're the two faces of object persistence.
2413600	2418600	As the object moves through time, its identity remains fixed,
2419600	2423600	and it doesn't change the time that it's moving through.
2423600	2427600	So if I'm measuring its motion with a clock,
2428600	2431600	moving the object doesn't change the clock.
2433600	2436600	These are clearly very classical ideas.
2438600	2442600	And we talked about earlier classical communication.
2444600	2448600	And when we talked about classical communication,
2448600	2452600	and for example the context of a Bell EPR experiment,
2453600	2458600	we talked about the observers being able to write down some data
2459600	2463600	on a piece of paper or on a disk drive or something,
2464600	2467600	and hand those data to someone else.
2468600	2470600	So this is translational invariance.
2471600	2474600	The data can't change when Alice gives it to Bob.
2474600	2478600	Otherwise there isn't classical communication taking place.
2479600	2482600	And of course there's an up to noise built into here.
2483600	2487600	The piece of paper might get wet and the ink might run a little bit,
2488600	2490600	but it's still the same message.
2491600	2493600	There's still some identity being assumed.
2494600	2499600	So object persistence is not an idea we get from quantum theory.
2499600	2503600	It's an idea that we impose on top of quantum theory.
2504600	2507600	And it's this idea that's intrinsically classical.
2508600	2513600	So we're looking right here at the quantum to classical transition.
2514600	2515600	This is it.
2516600	2520600	This is what gets added to quantum theory to get classical physics.
2521600	2523600	It's this idea of object persistence.
2524600	2526600	Now once we have object persistence,
2526600	2530600	we can kind of go to town constructing space.
2534600	2537600	And here's how we do it.
2539600	2543600	We all learned about object persistence this way
2544600	2548600	when we were six months old doing motor babbling
2549600	2554600	and observing our hands and feeling how our bodies worked.
2554600	2559600	And seeing objects that we could manipulate
2560600	2563600	and that didn't change when we manipulated them.
2564600	2567600	So this is the birth of object persistence.
2568600	2573600	This is the birth of classicality in human psychology.
2577600	2580600	So now let's start thinking about building a coordinate system.
2581600	2582600	What's a coordinate system?
2582600	2586600	A coordinate system is just a set of labels that are attached
2587600	2589600	to these segments of the environment.
2590600	2593600	And to build a coordinate system, you have to have an origin.
2594600	2598600	And an origin means an object, something that's fixed,
2599600	2601600	something that doesn't move around.
2602600	2607600	And so a coordinate system requires the ability
2607600	2610600	to identify a stigmurgic memory.
2611600	2615600	Requires the ability to find something in the environment
2616600	2620600	that has a meaning that stays constant over time.
2621600	2624600	And that's what a stigmurgic memory is.
2625600	2627600	It's something in the environment that provides us
2628600	2632600	with a memory resource that we can count on being the same.
2633600	2638600	And it's having this fixed point
2639600	2643600	that allows us to label these connected segments
2644600	2648600	of the environment that contain objects that move
2649600	2652600	and be able to say, okay, the object moved
2653600	2655600	from this part of the environment to another part.
2656600	2659600	And I can give those parts labels with respect
2659600	2664600	to this other part that doesn't move, this origin point.
2665600	2670600	And once I have this, I can construct other invariances.
2671600	2674600	So for example, I can consider an object that rotates
2675600	2677600	around this origin without changing its identity.
2678600	2682600	And that defines what's called rotational invariance.
2683600	2688600	And I can also talk about an object that gets bigger
2689600	2694600	and smaller compared to this fixed point.
2695600	2697600	And that defines radial distance.
2698600	2702600	And if you think about the baby in the previous slide
2703600	2706600	that's doing motor babbling, it sees things getting smaller
2707600	2709600	as it moves them farther away.
2710600	2714600	So the visual system does this computation for us
2715600	2718600	and constructs this radial coordinate for us
2719600	2723600	with our bodies or specifically our heads, our eyes.
2725600	2732600	So in doing this very early motor activity,
2733600	2736600	we're actually building the spatial coordinate system
2737600	2740600	for our brains that's implemented by the hippocampus,
2741600	2743600	the place cells in the hippocampus.
2744600	2748600	And if I have an origin point in the environment,
2749600	2753600	I can also infer that I am moving,
2754600	2758600	that I have changed my location with respect to that object.
2759600	2764600	And that's a considerably more complicated inference
2765600	2768600	because you have to have a representation of the self of you
2769600	2770600	to say I moved.
2771600	2774600	So this is something that comes after you've developed
2775600	2776600	this spatial coordinate system.
2776600	2779600	You have to be able to locate, in a sense, metacognitively,
2780600	2784600	a particular object that's you in that coordinate system.
2786600	2791600	So we're going to set that aside and now talk about adding
2792600	2794600	some numbers, so adding a metric.
2795600	2801600	And adding a metric requires another particular kind of object,
2802600	2809600	which is a ruler, a particular fixed object that can be moved
2810600	2814600	around and that has translational invariance
2815600	2818600	and rotational invariance up to some transformation,
2819600	2820600	up to some tensor.
2821600	2824600	And in Euclidean space, that tensor is the identity.
2825600	2829600	So in Euclidean space, you have perfect translational
2829600	2830600	and rotational invariance.
2831600	2834600	As you get into general relativity,
2835600	2838600	then the ruler can actually change its length as you rotate
2839600	2842600	or the ruler can change its length as it moves through space.
2843600	2846600	So effectively, your space time can deform.
2847600	2849600	The coordinates of your space time can deform
2850600	2852600	and that gives you the representation of mass,
2853600	2854600	of course, in general relativity.
2855600	2862600	So we talked several sessions ago about quantum reference frames
2863600	2867600	and I use the example of rulers and clocks as quantum reference frames.
2868600	2874600	So now we see how to construct those from observations
2875600	2878600	and symmetry breaking and object identity,
2878600	2883600	all of which we need to define a quantum reference frame
2884600	2886600	out in the environment like a ruler.
2887600	2891600	And notice that we don't need any of that environmental stuff
2892600	2897600	to define those QRFs within our own processing.
2898600	2902600	And in fact, the ones that exist within us,
2903600	2905600	we have no direct access to.
2905600	2909600	We can look at someone else's brain and talk about
2910600	2912600	their spatial representation system,
2913600	2915600	but we can't look inside our own brains
2916600	2918600	and talk about our spatial representation system.
2919600	2925600	So this is how we get a metric space from the ground up.
2926600	2930600	And we've talked about this from a very psychological
2931600	2933600	or biological point of view.
2933600	2939600	Starting from sort of motor capabilities,
2940600	2942600	motor babbling, for example,
2943600	2949600	a measure of effort, which gives you some sense of mass.
2950600	2952600	So if it's easy to move something, it's light
2953600	2955600	and if it's hard to move something, it's heavy.
2956600	2960600	And we understand that when we're six months old
2960600	2963600	because we can measure how much force we're having to apply
2964600	2965600	with our muscles.
2966600	2971600	We have a reference internally for this force that we're applying.
2972600	2977600	And we use that internal measurement to attribute
2978600	2981600	this idea of mass to things in the environment.
2982600	2984600	We have to have memory from manipulations.
2985600	2989600	We have to be able to identify variances that define
2990600	2993600	objects, object persistence.
2994600	2996600	And we have to be able to build a ruler
2997600	3001600	that we can move around and use to define a metric space.
3002600	3006600	Now, this is very different from the way physicists approach this.
3007600	3009600	And if you look at the physics literature,
3010600	3012600	then people start with information transfer.
3013600	3017600	They talk about entanglement as a basic resource.
3018600	3023600	There's a lot of discussion of bulk boundary duality.
3024600	3029600	And the most well-known one is the duality between antideciderspace,
3030600	3032600	which is the sort of space you see inside a black hole
3033600	3038600	and conformal field theory, quantum field theory on the boundary
3039600	3040600	of the black hole.
3041600	3045600	So things you can see, for example, going on on the horizon
3045600	3049600	of a black hole or dual to the geometry in the interior
3051600	3053600	by this mathematical relationship.
3054600	3056600	You can use that mathematical relationship
3057600	3059600	to construct a quantum error correcting code
3060600	3066600	by using the symmetries of the field theory
3067600	3069600	as a resource for redundancy that allows you
3070600	3072600	to represent the same thing in different places.
3072600	3074600	And as soon as you can do that,
3075600	3077600	you can build up a network of elements
3078600	3080600	that look basically like elements of a lattice.
3081600	3087600	And a lattice is a graph to which you can assign
3088600	3092600	some metric relationships and you get a metric space.
3093600	3097600	And in physics, typically the goal is to get Einstein's equations
3098600	3100600	out of this to start with some information,
3100600	3104600	theoretic sorts of constructs, and get the equations
3105600	3106600	of general relativity.
3107600	3109600	But what are the equations of general relativity?
3110600	3112600	I mean, these are things that Einstein derived
3113600	3115600	by doing fairly simple thought experiments
3116600	3125600	using the invariances of ordinary Euclidean space
3125600	3130600	combined with ideas from special relativity
3131600	3132600	about the speed of light being constant.
3133600	3136600	And he added the principle of equivalence,
3137600	3142600	which is the idea that essentially mass
3143600	3144600	and acceleration are the same thing,
3145600	3148600	or that gravity and acceleration are the same,
3149600	3151600	the weight and acceleration are the same thing.
3152600	3156600	So it's at least reasonable to expect
3157600	3165600	that this inferential process that's going on
3166600	3170600	in theoretical physics is generating the same thing,
3171600	3173600	although in a very formalized way,
3174600	3179600	that we can generate by thinking about how organisms deal
3179600	3180600	with their environments.
3181600	3185600	And so I want to leave this with you
3186600	3188600	as the second hypothesis here.
3190600	3195600	The first one was the hypothesis about a trivial
3196600	3200600	renormalization group flow across scales and biology.
3201600	3205600	The second hypothesis is that these two approaches
3205600	3209600	to emergent spacetime are actually giving us
3210600	3215600	the same information and maybe starting out
3216600	3218600	with the same information, in fact,
3219600	3223600	that we may be able to think about these fundamental
3224600	3229600	building blocks of information flow and entanglement
3230600	3233600	in terms of the sorts of perceptual relationships
3233600	3237600	that we've been talking about in this class.
3238600	3245600	So there's our second hypothesis to think about going forward.
3247600	3250600	And I just want to leave you with the idea that organisms,
3251600	3256600	at least, manage this very interesting process
3257600	3266600	that we can think of starting with the construct of memory.
3267600	3271600	Organisms have memory at multiple scales,
3272600	3277600	and it's memory that allows them to formulate the idea
3278600	3279600	that there are objects.
3280600	3284600	And as soon as you have objects that persist,
3284600	3286600	you have a source of redundancy.
3287600	3289600	So you can do error correction.
3290600	3292600	And if you can do error correction,
3293600	3297600	if you can move the same thing from one place to another
3298600	3300600	and have it encode the same information,
3301600	3302600	then you can build spacetime.
3304600	3306600	And as soon as you have spacetime,
3307600	3309600	you can use the spacetime as more memory.
3310600	3315600	You can use the spacetime itself as an error corrected code
3316600	3321600	because spacetime has the nice ability to hold lots of copies
3322600	3324600	of some informative structure.
3325600	3327600	So you can build libraries or you can build computers
3328600	3330600	or you can build the internet if you have spacetime,
3331600	3332600	which gives you more memory,
3333600	3334600	which gives you more object persistence,
3335600	3336600	which gives you more error correction,
3337600	3338600	and the circle just spins around.
3339600	3340600	So organisms do this,
3341600	3343600	and the question is how does it get off the ground?
3344600	3349600	And next time we can at least speculate
3350600	3354600	about that kind of origin of life type of question
3355600	3357600	in the context of the FEP
3358600	3363600	and its realization in simple systems of communicating observers.
3364600	3370600	So as always, I encourage you to use the interactive Q&A.
3371600	3374600	The fifth discussion session with Andrew,
3375600	3376600	who's unfortunately not here today,
3377600	3379600	will be the last day of September,
3380600	3382600	Saturday at five as usual,
3383600	3384600	five o'clock European time,
3385600	3386600	eight o'clock California time.
3387600	3388600	And then the last session of the class
3389600	3390600	will be the 12th of October.
3390600	3394600	So thank you very much.
3395600	3396600	And I look forward to your questions
3397600	3398600	in the interactive Q&A.
3408600	3409600	Thank you, Chris.
3410600	3411600	Can I ask you some short questions?
3412600	3413600	Sure.
3414600	3415600	All right.
3416600	3417600	So first from Lana wrote,
3417600	3420600	is the periodicity the time lengths between
3421600	3423600	and during the excitations built in?
3424600	3426600	So this was when we had the four cells
3427600	3430600	and there was the inklings of a clock coming into play.
3441600	3444600	I think the simplest answer is that
3447600	3451600	if nothing else is happening in the environment
3452600	3454600	except this periodic behavior,
3455600	3463600	then it's not actually meaningful to talk yet
3464600	3466600	about the time between the events.
3468600	3476600	So if I have a periodic, a system that's quasi periodic,
3477600	3484600	for example, and nothing else is going on in my environment,
3485600	3489600	then I can't distinguish that from a perfectly periodic system
3490600	3493600	because I would have to have a perfectly periodic reference
3494600	3497600	to know that the other system was a periodic.
3498600	3501600	And if you think about the internal clock
3502600	3507600	being driven by information flow into the system,
3508600	3511600	then something has to be happening in the environment
3512600	3514600	for information to be flowing into the system
3515600	3516600	and being counted.
3517600	3521600	So again, as we talked about a few sessions ago,
3522600	3526600	the internal memory only gets updated when something happens.
3527600	3532600	So internal and external get tied together.
3533600	3536600	And this is why we can use external clocks.
3538600	3542600	But it's also why we depend on external clocks
3543600	3549600	because our intuitive sense of time is very malleable.
3550600	3556600	And so we actually, as humans, use external clocks
3557600	3563600	to correct for the malleability of our own intuitive sense of time.
3565600	3566600	Wow.
3567600	3570600	And there's probably a lot to be said for that procrustian nature
3571600	3574600	of having the conometer, the clock on the wall,
3575600	3580600	and the tick, tick, tick as an evolutionarily novel ruler
3581600	3587600	of time playing a logistical role in time-bound society.
3589600	3590600	Yeah.
3591600	3594600	And think of earlier clocks that earlier cultures have used
3595600	3596600	and that animals use.
3597600	3599600	I mean, we have the solar clock, the lunar clock, et cetera.
3600600	3605600	And the orbit of Venus clock that was so important to the Mayans
3606600	3607600	and so on.
3608600	3611600	So there are lots of available clocks in the environment
3612600	3614600	if you have the ability to notice them
3615600	3618600	and enough memory to realize that they're clocks.
3620600	3621600	Awesome.
3622600	3624600	All right, here's a question from Upcycle Club.
3624600	3628600	They wrote, how does representing the network structure
3629600	3633600	and dynamics with quantum embeddings affect the semantic interpretation
3634600	3635600	of the network?
3642600	3647600	The embedding theory is the simplest semantic interpretation
3648600	3649600	of the network.
3650600	3651600	So...
3657600	3663600	And again, a good way to think of this is through the lens
3664600	3665600	of computer science.
3667600	3672600	As soon as you have a programming language that allows variable binding,
3673600	3678600	then you've built a very simple kind of semantics into the language.
3680600	3685600	If you have X as a variable and you have variable binding,
3686600	3691600	then at different times in the execution of the program,
3693600	3696600	X can have different causal consequences
3697600	3698600	for downstream computation
3698600	3701600	because it's been bound to a different value.
3702600	3704600	So it has different semantics.
3705600	3712600	So the semantics of X, again, go back to Gregory Bateson.
3714600	3718600	The basis of semantics is differences that make a difference,
3719600	3720600	make a difference to behavior,
3721600	3722600	make a difference to actionability.
3723600	3729600	So variable binding gives you differences that actually make a difference
3730600	3731600	to what the program does.
3733600	3737600	So what is that?
3738600	3744600	That is the semantics that's assigned by your embedding theory
3746600	3748600	between what the programming language is doing
3749600	3751600	and what the operating system is doing and so forth.
3753600	3760600	And I think it's no surprise that the semantics of programming languages
3761600	3767600	end up being represented with these very general mathematical constructs
3768600	3769600	like category theory,
3770600	3779600	which are essentially tools for representing arbitrary relations
3779600	3781600	between systems.
3782600	3785600	And that's what embedding theories are.
3786600	3791600	They're theories that state relationships between systems.
3795600	3796600	Awesome.
3797600	3802600	And very provocative to explore on the biological and life
3803600	3805600	and on the spacetime and matter sides,
3805600	3811600	which are, of course, seamlessly integrated through,
3812600	3813600	if only our own experiences.
3815600	3818600	Yeah, this is another place where it's useful to go back to this
3819600	3823600	difference between reductive theories and scale-free theories.
3824600	3826600	And scale-free theories are all about semantics
3827600	3832600	because they represent the existence of stuff happening at different scales
3832600	3838600	and so they naturally raise the question of what are these relationships?
3839600	3841600	What are these embedding theories?
3842600	3849600	And in reductive theories, there's a very deep sense in which semantics doesn't matter.
3850600	3857600	If you think that all that's going on that's important
3858600	3860600	is the stuff that's going on at the Planck scale,
3861600	3865600	then you don't need any semantics, right?
3866600	3878600	And so you see this in late 60s, early 70s, old-fashioned AI,
3879600	3886600	where people talk about computation as purely syntactic.
3887600	3889600	And this is a very reductionist view of computation
3890600	3891600	without the semantics.
3892600	3895600	And without the semantics, the computation is useless.
3896600	3899600	It doesn't tell us anything at all unless we can map it to something.
3901600	3908600	So we have this philosophy of science tradition
3909600	3911600	that tells us that semantics is not important.
3912600	3916600	And we end up with tools like the FEP
3917600	3920600	that essentially tell us that semantics is all important.
3923600	3925600	And from a biological point of view,
3928600	3931600	the most natural response is, of course, we knew that all the time.
3932600	3933600	That's why we're doing biology.
3935600	3939600	So all of this ties together.
3940600	3944600	Would you say that FEP says semantics is important
3944600	3948600	and then what does it say about what semantics are important
3949600	3951600	or is that entirely left up to the modular?
3956600	3958600	Well, it tells you a lot about what's important
3959600	3962600	for the system itself, right?
3963600	3965600	The system itself is dealing with its environment
3967600	3972600	and it's trying to increase its predictive power.
3973600	3976600	So it's building a theory of the environment
3977600	3981600	and that theory is intrinsically semantic, right?
3982600	3985600	It's about the environment and it's actionable.
3986600	3992600	The theory is meant to drive action on the environment
3993600	3996600	that will either yield more information
3997600	4002600	or get the environment to behave
4003600	4006600	to do what I'm predicting it's going to do.
4008600	4013600	So I think the FEP is intrinsically semantic
4014600	4017600	in that sense that it's about an agent modeling its environment.
4018600	4021600	Yes, and about the semantics of action
4021600	4027600	as opposed to a partial or limited semantics
4028600	4031600	of passive inferiors or semantics of abstraction
4034600	4037600	which leaves the important link between the agent
4038600	4041600	and the environment through sense making and decision selection
4042600	4044600	basically unaddressed because it's kind of
4045600	4046600	in the thought experiment in the room
4047600	4049600	and here when we actually engage with the boundary of the room
4049600	4051600	that's where we start.
4052600	4058600	Yeah, the FEP completely destroys this classical notion
4059600	4064600	of the passive observer as does quantum theory.
4065600	4067600	There are no passive observers in quantum theory.
4068600	4071600	So this is a construct that we inherited
4072600	4077600	from a classical worldview that is seriously misleading.
4080600	4086600	There's a lot more to say but that's a great place to end.
4087600	4088600	Thank you, Chris.
4089600	4093600	Okay, thank you, Daniel and thanks to you all and ask questions.
4094600	4095600	See you next time.
4096600	4097600	We'll see you next time.
4109600	4111600	Thank you.
