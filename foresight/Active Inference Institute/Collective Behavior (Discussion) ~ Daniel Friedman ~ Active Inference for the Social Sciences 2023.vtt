00:00.000 --> 00:16.040
Hello and welcome. It's August 16th, 2023. We're in the Collective Behavior Discussion

00:16.040 --> 00:24.280
section of the Active Inference for the Social Sciences course in 2023. So perhaps let us

00:24.280 --> 00:35.680
all go around and give an opening introduction and or reflection and see who joins and what

00:35.680 --> 00:40.120
happens from there. But just so that everybody has said hello.

00:40.120 --> 00:57.840
Hi everyone, I'm Bryn. I'm PM in South Africa and yeah, just excited to be here and see what

00:57.840 --> 01:17.840
happens. Hi, I'm Andrew. I'm a graduate student in Indiana and I guess my field of interest

01:17.840 --> 01:23.480
now is the knowledge management and I think that figuring out how we collectively learn

01:23.480 --> 01:32.680
and can share information is a really interesting topic and I'd like to see how this would apply.

01:38.040 --> 01:46.560
Hi, I'm Regina and I'm from Guatemala, but I'm living in Spain, studying and doing experiments

01:46.560 --> 01:54.400
related to this topic and trying to learn a little bit of the theory that's behind it so we can, you know,

01:54.400 --> 02:05.360
advance better. I'm excited. Hello, my name is Sasha. I'm calling in from California. I'm also a graduate

02:05.360 --> 02:13.480
student. Yeah, just really enjoyed the spirited presentation last week. I'm looking forward to

02:13.480 --> 02:26.720
discussion. All right, well, how about anyone can give a first reflection on collective behavior or

02:26.720 --> 02:36.960
what was their thought or context before and where are they at as we kind of begin? Yeah, Regina.

02:37.400 --> 02:49.560
Okay, so I just want to make sure that I understand because I took like two big lessons from your

02:49.560 --> 02:57.800
lesson, right? And the first one is that, you know, this famous model of active inference that has

02:58.200 --> 03:07.160
the agent and the environment and the mark of blanket in the middle, right, and just interacts

03:07.160 --> 03:13.520
with everything, right? So I think what I got from what you discussed, maybe I didn't have a good

03:13.520 --> 03:22.040
definition of an agent, but first that you can have that agent not be just an individual, but also

03:22.080 --> 03:29.720
your definition of an individual changes, depending on what you want to study in the behavior, right?

03:29.760 --> 03:39.800
So an agent can be an ant, it can be an ecosystem, it can be an eye looking at something, or it can

03:39.800 --> 03:46.120
be as a society, for example. And I think that's a big take for me because it changes a lot the

03:46.120 --> 03:53.720
concept of how to study things and use active inference just by changing how big the agent can

03:53.720 --> 04:00.000
be. So I don't know if I got that right, right? So first that clarification.

04:03.560 --> 04:04.960
So what is an agent?

04:09.880 --> 04:15.080
Yeah, so I don't know if there's like a formal definition of an agent in active inference, right?

04:15.120 --> 04:23.240
But if we, if we want to study whatever we want to study, because I'm not going to study because I

04:23.240 --> 04:31.120
have to do that's like my goal, whatever I'm doing. So I want to study whatever I have to choose

04:31.160 --> 04:38.200
what's going to be my agent and the environment it has. So choosing the agent, you can do it to

04:38.200 --> 04:46.760
create a model or to make an experiment, whatever. But the choice you make, it will depend on your

04:48.600 --> 04:53.720
and what you understand as an individual or as an agent, I think so, right?

05:05.200 --> 05:06.600
Awesome. Anyone have a thought on that?

05:06.600 --> 05:16.720
No, if I continue with just to add something else and this will be my mind. And then I'm thinking is that

05:19.040 --> 05:29.320
also a big problem that we have or I think I have is that since I am part of the environment, you

05:29.320 --> 05:33.920
know, you know, the perspective of whoever is studying whatever it is, it's also going to be an

05:33.920 --> 05:41.280
effect in it. So maybe, maybe scientists already decided, but I don't know that we can never have an

05:41.280 --> 05:49.400
objective way of studying something if you're part of the environment of the agent. So I don't know

05:49.400 --> 05:54.800
we already forgot it, or we already decided that's it. We cannot have objective observations of

05:54.800 --> 06:01.480
behavior in general. But you know, you always think about like the agent environment, and you

06:01.480 --> 06:07.520
start in it as something else, but the something else is also affecting it. So I see that as a

06:07.520 --> 06:13.120
problem, or maybe something that has to be said, like, we are not objective, because we're part of

06:13.120 --> 06:20.240
what it's affecting our agents in the behavior collectively too. So those are the thoughts I

06:20.240 --> 06:21.280
have to share.

06:24.120 --> 06:31.400
Regina, I'm also new to all of this. So my preliminary understanding of what is an agent,

06:31.880 --> 06:42.120
is anything that has any good reason to self evidence, and to itself, or to survive,

06:43.400 --> 06:49.160
that doesn't want to dissipate, that might delineate the boundary of what an agent is that then

06:49.160 --> 07:02.760
sets up the boundaries with which it will, as you described, start interacting with the world,

07:02.760 --> 07:08.880
the environment. So if something, as I understand it, if something has a reason to go on being, to

07:08.880 --> 07:16.400
survive, then it is an agent in the world.

07:19.200 --> 07:25.240
Okay, but that agent could be anything, right? Like, is that what you're saying, right? Like, if he

07:25.240 --> 07:31.720
wants to survive, can be an ant surviving individually, or a cell or a group? Okay, yeah,

07:32.000 --> 07:34.600
that's a good, that's like a good definition.

07:35.040 --> 07:42.040
Yeah, Sasha.

07:42.040 --> 07:52.160
Great points, Regina. So much to say there. It's something that I have experienced with as a

07:52.160 --> 08:00.400
researcher in biology is deciding the kind of the statistics or sampling approach to use,

08:00.520 --> 08:08.080
whether we're taking, you know, one cell from one individual, or we're taking many cells from

08:08.080 --> 08:15.880
many individuals, and how to do the statistics and kind of sampling approach on that. That is a,

08:15.880 --> 08:22.080
you know, an evergreen question that we're always reevaluating to see how to think about the

08:22.120 --> 08:31.280
independencies within biological systems. And then another thing that you mentioned was about

08:31.280 --> 08:37.640
the individual being part of the ecosystem. And that makes me think a lot about complexity

08:37.640 --> 08:44.680
science and something that is addressed there in thinking about the interplay of the scientists

08:45.280 --> 08:51.400
and what they're studying. Yeah, thank you for those points.

08:59.400 --> 09:06.760
Sasha, sorry, I'm not raising my hand. I'm just unmuting. That's okay. Can you say a bit more

09:06.760 --> 09:09.400
about what you mean by complexity science? It is

09:14.680 --> 09:26.800
maybe muted. Oh, can't speak at the moment.

09:26.800 --> 09:37.480
Yeah, complexity science has looked at agent, agent based modeling as a fundamental tool,

09:38.360 --> 09:45.560
John Holland signals and boundaries, focusing on what, from an active inference side, we might say

09:45.560 --> 09:53.320
as like message passing or communication for the messages and then boundaries with the whole

09:53.320 --> 10:01.080
discussion around the boundaries in the world, map territory, map territory fallacy, map territory

10:01.160 --> 10:11.480
fallacy, fallacy, doing iterative modeling. Sasha brought up limited experimental resources in the

10:11.480 --> 10:17.880
scientific setting. And that's kind of analogous to the limited energy budget or attentional

10:17.880 --> 10:26.360
budget, ultimately, or just decision making budget of the kinds of active entities that

10:26.680 --> 10:34.680
make sense to model the ones that kind of have those characteristics. This is really the question

10:34.680 --> 10:41.880
of what makes something first principles or what are the first principles. One aspect of it as brought

10:41.880 --> 10:49.480
up is the censoring of the persistence. So from the outside, that's kind of like an empiricist's

10:50.280 --> 10:57.000
view of persistence, like is it measurable, but not saying that something is necessarily that,

10:57.000 --> 11:03.160
which is the statistical tool. And then the sort of like inside out implementation type.

11:05.240 --> 11:13.560
But there's a lot more to say in that who wants to bring in some new angle or

11:13.880 --> 11:19.960
or how do they see collective behavior? Why do we talk about collective behavior?

11:21.720 --> 11:26.440
Why not just behavior, recognize that behavior is multi scale or is social?

11:29.160 --> 11:37.640
What's really being communicated with the collective?

11:43.880 --> 11:49.880
I mean, I believe that we chose those levels so we can make it more simple for our brains to

11:49.880 --> 11:55.720
understand it. Because if we talk about collective behavior, actually is the universe

11:56.680 --> 12:04.760
behaving in the particles and everything, right? So I don't know if that's a little bit just based

12:04.760 --> 12:10.600
on I don't know what's the word like just in the material world and how it physically moves.

12:10.600 --> 12:20.440
And that's like deterministic or whatever, right? But I think we chose to have those limitations

12:20.440 --> 12:25.320
so we could understand the world. But also we should acknowledge that are limited because we're

12:25.320 --> 12:32.440
part of the system. I'm having a little trouble on my kind of understanding the

12:33.400 --> 12:43.800
I guess where the schism lies between kind of the Markov blanket and the Umwelt in

12:43.800 --> 12:48.680
semiotics of like the animals sensory experience.

12:49.000 --> 13:03.080
Anyone have a maybe maybe someone could I mean, Daniel, do you know

13:05.160 --> 13:06.520
like the difference between that two?

13:08.360 --> 13:12.360
Can you be a little louder? Thank you though. Andrew, anyone have a thought on that?

13:12.920 --> 13:18.360
I'll bring in a definition of Umwelt and then and then we can see. But meanwhile,

13:18.360 --> 13:25.800
does anyone have a thought? Sorry, I was just muted on Zoom. Andrew, you're a little quiet,

13:26.440 --> 13:32.920
but I'm going to bring in a definition of Umwelt and then meanwhile, does anyone have a thought?

13:43.320 --> 13:46.680
I hope I'm not

13:49.400 --> 14:00.120
the diluting Andrews question. But I think of collective behavior in kind of like a,

14:00.840 --> 14:05.560
I don't know, football team or soccer team. And what that provides

14:05.720 --> 14:11.240
is the the group who is

14:13.400 --> 14:20.760
share some common ethos and what that does to the how that regulates the their collective or

14:20.760 --> 14:27.640
individual and collective free energies during a match or throughout the season and how that

14:27.800 --> 14:45.960
that gives some charge to some investment because it's my team against yours. And we have to try

14:45.960 --> 14:56.120
and win. And so, you know, without without that collective behavior, it's it's might be far harder

14:56.120 --> 15:05.160
to achieve groups goals if they aren't able to collaborate and share, you know, implicitly and

15:05.160 --> 15:11.720
explicitly certain traits, behaviors, thoughts, feelings, ideals, ideologies, whatever they might be

15:12.360 --> 15:16.760
and how that then allows us to compete in the world.

15:16.760 --> 15:28.920
I see what you think it's it's been. Yes. Okay. Okay. I see what you're seeing,

15:30.040 --> 15:33.640
especially because we're watching the World Cup, right? Women's World Cup.

15:35.480 --> 15:40.520
Yeah. So it's very relevant. Yeah. But I see that in all the

15:41.480 --> 15:46.840
these things you've said, it seems that for you behavior needs to have like a goal.

15:47.560 --> 15:52.920
And I don't know if I if I agree with that, it's either survival or winning.

15:54.760 --> 15:59.480
But for me, it's just something that happens. And maybe the consequence is surviving.

16:00.200 --> 16:06.840
But it's not the goal to survive or to win the game. I mean, in the football, it is right.

16:06.840 --> 16:13.320
But in general, maybe there's no goal to the behavior collectively.

16:14.520 --> 16:18.920
It's just just a thought. It's interesting.

16:21.720 --> 16:29.320
Yeah, a great comments. Well, the paper of Connor Heinz at all on the collective behavior as

16:29.320 --> 16:37.560
surprise minimization that points the way towards using the act in fontology, these kinds of modeling

16:37.560 --> 16:43.480
approaches for collective behavioral situations, and really just recognizing them as a certain type

16:43.480 --> 16:50.840
of behavioral modeling. The simplest case might just be a single closed system.

16:51.800 --> 17:01.800
All part of the composition that leads to the ability to describe at very least a lot of

17:01.800 --> 17:05.720
different kinds of systems, just like a linear model can describe a lot of systems. So then

17:06.760 --> 17:12.840
it's also really interesting, a topic that came up in one of the recent textbook groups

17:13.800 --> 17:22.600
with what's normative about active inference. Because the term of the process theory, even

17:22.600 --> 17:29.400
of active inference, being normative is mentioned multiple times. And that's definitely a topic

17:29.400 --> 17:38.520
that connects to the social sciences. One can imagine the kind of niche normativity or niche

17:39.160 --> 17:47.240
regularities in a broad sense, and then the real minute particulars of how they play out,

17:47.800 --> 17:56.920
which kind of hints at the kind of descriptive or causal minimum to start making some

17:56.920 --> 18:01.000
anything but toy specific generative models.

18:01.560 --> 18:15.160
So it's been an interesting theme to see even already in Avel's and Ben's lectures and discussions.

18:16.920 --> 18:26.520
This question between description, process of describing, which is what I associated with

18:27.080 --> 18:33.560
Professor Gordon's approach to ant watching, how that descriptive process,

18:34.200 --> 18:41.080
which is what we can say that we have for active inference, just like a linear modeling ecosystem

18:41.080 --> 18:49.560
could say about their linear modeling in principle, and how to then articulate the

18:49.560 --> 18:57.720
normativities of the framework, if that concept, if that separation can even exist

18:59.000 --> 19:11.240
from the behavioral normativities that include the basis of social fabric in all different

19:11.240 --> 19:12.280
kinds of communities.

19:50.040 --> 20:06.360
Here's another question. So what is the role of any technical detail in the social sciences,

20:07.560 --> 20:15.880
whether more on the statistical connecting with data or more category,

20:15.880 --> 20:23.880
theoretic like just formal? What's the role of formal methods in

20:26.040 --> 20:31.320
different kinds of academic or practical expressions about social systems?

20:31.960 --> 20:44.200
Does it matter at all how we think about a framework at all?

20:46.360 --> 20:55.160
Well, for formalizing aspects of a social system, I would say that the purpose is for

20:55.800 --> 21:05.640
communication between individuals, because just we can't verify that.

21:07.080 --> 21:12.360
Well, formalizing is just setting a system on top of what you're observing,

21:14.280 --> 21:22.280
but there is no explicit guarantee that you're saying encompasses everything of the phenomena

21:22.280 --> 21:36.600
you're observing. And just kind of going back to Taoism of the name that can be named is not

21:36.600 --> 21:45.720
the true eternal name. And so it's just a way of, it's a slice of what we can observe,

21:46.680 --> 21:54.840
and the way to, you know, maybe you can make predictions or maybe you can generate something

21:54.840 --> 22:03.640
that acts like the phenomena you're observing, but it's just a way to kind of,

22:08.760 --> 22:14.920
it's just a way to kind of approximate our understanding of some phenomena and you have

22:15.000 --> 22:18.760
to slice it in a specific way, but also understanding that it is a slice or,

22:18.760 --> 22:21.560
you know, it is a tangent line that you're approximating as opposed to

22:22.520 --> 22:26.840
encompassing the whole system from verbalizing it.

22:34.840 --> 22:38.520
I was at, maybe it's not the goal, but something that happened instead of

22:39.320 --> 22:46.840
describing any system, like Andrew said, it's like the goal to modify it or to

22:48.680 --> 22:54.440
or to co-opt it in some way to gain control or whatever. If you know the model,

22:55.000 --> 23:02.200
you know how to play the game, kind of. So you write instructions and try to see if you can

23:03.160 --> 23:09.960
outsmart someone else. I mean, it sounds kind of dark, right? But maybe it's one of the goals to

23:09.960 --> 23:14.040
or something that just happens out of nulling the rules that nobody else's knows.

23:18.200 --> 23:20.760
I mean, I guess when you talk about control, there is a

23:24.600 --> 23:31.800
shade that can be gained from that specific wording, but control in terms of, you know,

23:32.200 --> 23:37.400
control theory or, you know, that comes from electrical engineering. It's really just what

23:39.800 --> 23:45.400
shapes the behavior or what are the inputs that drive the behavior. And when you're talking about

23:45.400 --> 23:51.160
control, it's really just about, well, if you change these inputs, how does that change the

23:51.160 --> 24:00.360
behavior? And so you can actually, you know, from electrical engineering of controlling some sort

24:00.360 --> 24:07.640
of electromechanical system, but then you can make analogous statements on like control into

24:07.640 --> 24:12.600
society, which doesn't necessarily mean like the dark negative control. But like, you know, maybe

24:12.600 --> 24:19.320
there's some pathological behavior in a society or, you know, even pathological

24:24.040 --> 24:28.440
pathological responses within the brain. And it's like, well, what is what is driving that?

24:28.440 --> 24:38.600
And is it possible to change the drivers of that to have something that is more beneficial to the

24:38.600 --> 24:55.000
system? Yeah, just to add to what Andrew's saying, because it matters sometimes how you manipulate

24:55.320 --> 25:07.000
you know, a system or it matters how you affect a brain. So it cannot be random. I mean, you know,

25:07.000 --> 25:13.640
we've come a long way, for example, from lobotomy, which had disastrous effects. And

25:14.600 --> 25:24.520
it matters to a system how you affect it. And so to know more formally, the most effective way

25:25.320 --> 25:31.640
to create a desired effect, whatever that might be, it's essential that it's not just kind of poking

25:31.640 --> 25:45.480
and prodding. As much as that is part of the scientific method to update that method in

25:45.480 --> 25:55.800
accordance with what you're learning. So it is important. No, I think you're both right. I

25:55.800 --> 26:03.800
didn't have to be back. But also something that Andrew said about predicting, I think that's one

26:03.800 --> 26:15.160
of also the big goals, trying to predict whether to be prepared to, or just to, I mean, couldn't be

26:15.160 --> 26:22.520
to control, right? But if you can somehow predict how people respond to this or how a system will

26:23.160 --> 26:32.360
behave in this other scenario, you can, you know, change what input is, or prepare for whatever comes,

26:32.360 --> 26:46.200
I guess. Yeah, a lot of great points. Some of the commonly held, not equally by everyone, everyone,

26:46.200 --> 26:52.680
but some of the tenants of science being to explain predict designing control,

26:54.440 --> 27:01.560
where explanation and prediction are on the pathway towards systems designing and

27:01.560 --> 27:08.280
and maintenance and other other words that people can add. But that's the pragmatic utility oriented

27:08.280 --> 27:13.640
view, which doesn't have to be an absolutist view. But certainly there are regimes of attention

27:13.720 --> 27:23.160
socially, now and seemingly for long, long times, where people were wanting to retain and to

27:23.160 --> 27:30.280
constrain the variance distribution on what we would say is their generative model, some norm,

27:30.920 --> 27:37.320
and then other times, engaging in these functions. And that instrumentalist usage of active inference

27:37.320 --> 27:46.600
is like, we're going to be able to model it with a pretty minimum framework that's commonly used

27:46.600 --> 27:52.840
in statistical systems, where some things we observe and some we don't. And at least we know

27:52.840 --> 27:59.000
and how all the pieces are connected. And then that is an artifact in model based design,

27:59.240 --> 28:09.880
as people develop that line through time socially, just like probably has been always

28:09.880 --> 28:14.840
the case for complex projects and scientific collaboration.

28:17.640 --> 28:20.120
There's a few other interesting pieces, but yeah, please, please.

28:20.840 --> 28:28.760
I'm just, I'm just wondering if now that I'm thinking a lot, isn't that like a problem

28:29.880 --> 28:36.440
for confirmation bias, right? Like, there's a paper in here here, because we create the

28:36.440 --> 28:41.560
knowledge and we tell everyone the knowledge. This is the model, this is how everything behaves.

28:41.560 --> 28:47.480
And then we update our knowledge about it. And then we look for everything to just,

28:48.280 --> 28:57.160
you know, confirm it. And, and yeah, maybe there's another system that will not let us be

28:58.280 --> 29:02.200
getting knowledge so slowly, because if everybody just agrees on something,

29:02.200 --> 29:07.080
we teach it to everyone, and we confirm the model, and then we just try to look for evidence for

29:07.080 --> 29:13.160
that model, then we go slowly if there's any better thing or better model that comes along.

29:14.040 --> 29:22.840
Yeah, a lot to say about that, like, if we believe that trees exist or that people exist,

29:22.840 --> 29:25.800
and then we come to see them. So there's kind of this sense where problem

29:25.800 --> 29:31.960
confirmation bias, which I think it's a great term, a great topic to bring in with definitely also

29:31.960 --> 29:37.400
what's called like the golden nail syndrome or something. If all you have is the hammer,

29:37.400 --> 29:42.520
then everything's a nail. And there's definitely a tension there, because it's like,

29:43.960 --> 29:48.520
how much of what you can do, are you supposed to do something that you can't do?

29:49.720 --> 29:53.720
Or, but then at least you could do what you needed to do to get there. So that's actually

29:53.720 --> 29:57.560
within your scope of what you can do. So it's not that there are things that you can do that you

29:57.560 --> 30:07.320
can't do, if just from measurement perspective. So like, how does it look? Or how do we recognize

30:07.320 --> 30:16.680
across systems? Or how do we have awareness in situations as limited individuals who do have

30:16.680 --> 30:24.600
all of these cognitive phenomena, how to make decisions or sense making or infrastructure

30:24.680 --> 30:32.040
or whatever it is, the socialness, the system of interest of the social sciences, make that

30:32.680 --> 30:35.160
and then dot dot dot normatively what?

30:39.320 --> 30:47.800
I think there's some protection built into the problem of confirmation bias because

30:48.360 --> 30:55.560
all knowledge generation is happening in an open system. And so there's always going to be an

30:55.560 --> 31:05.160
agent outside of your own mind and what it's perceiving that can then challenge or add to the

31:05.880 --> 31:18.040
you know, like the LK-99 semiconductors that have been all the rage recently and how

31:19.160 --> 31:27.640
other scientists have now kind of discredited it quite convincingly. And it's because of this open,

31:27.640 --> 31:32.520
they might have had degrees of confirmation bias that they were egging each other on,

31:32.520 --> 31:40.200
but it's ultimately been refuted, which is this built-in kind of protection because it's all

31:40.200 --> 31:53.240
operating in an open system, fortunately. Yeah, a lot to say there. Monday morning, reviewer doing.

31:54.120 --> 32:03.960
How do we again go from any given description of a communicative event like the kind of specific

32:03.960 --> 32:13.320
unfolding of the LK-99 narrative as yet uncompleted in the minds of some, which is real enough

32:13.960 --> 32:20.120
to be real socially. And so how do we go from any descriptive anything about that?

32:21.080 --> 32:33.640
Total observation to core screening. Then how do we come to work with that interface with

32:33.640 --> 32:36.360
what whatever that is hands that to us?

32:45.960 --> 32:56.360
What is the social behavior or some some classic or some novel social behaviors?

32:56.760 --> 33:07.080
Maybe ones that seem pretty obvious, due to recency bias.

33:18.840 --> 33:25.000
I'll just mention one aspect that Andrew and I have also talked about is the auto-poetic

33:25.800 --> 33:32.680
nature of information systems. Andrew, do you have any thought on this?

33:33.400 --> 33:41.960
Or about where auto-poesis comes into like social sciences or these kinds of models?

33:44.280 --> 33:47.720
Daniel, Andrew just left a note that he needs a... Okay, okay.

33:49.720 --> 33:53.480
Oh, totally. He just wasn't looking at the time. Funny stuff.

33:54.280 --> 33:55.480
Anyone else have a thought on that?

34:01.000 --> 34:07.320
Okay, just to kind of carry forward then. Basically, the ability of social systems that

34:07.320 --> 34:18.120
include written niche modification, cumulative culture, their increasing extent of control.

34:19.080 --> 34:25.640
As discussed earlier, that definitely is a bit of an overloaded or at least doubly meant term

34:25.640 --> 34:30.040
in different settings, because it can just simply mean modeling it with control theory,

34:30.600 --> 34:35.080
which is a pretty limited philosophical statement relative to any statistical method,

34:35.080 --> 34:42.440
or control like the kind that people are unhappy with and the kind that's described in

34:42.440 --> 34:49.320
thinking like a state. A lot of other works that I know, Mao and Lorena and Avel are going to be

34:49.880 --> 34:57.480
definitely going into more detail on... So when societies can model

34:59.400 --> 35:06.680
and introspect or self-reflect formally, much better.

35:12.600 --> 35:19.000
And that can happen through anything from free and open source,

35:19.720 --> 35:27.800
better aided protocols. There's many limited formats of self-meaning making, but cryptography

35:27.800 --> 35:32.520
definitely allows those explorations. And that doesn't necessarily mean computer cryptography.

35:32.520 --> 35:38.280
That could also be like linguistic encoding and all these other ways of niche

35:39.240 --> 35:49.560
sub-differentiation in multi-scale systems. You just do not see a system that is cookie cutter.

35:50.760 --> 35:57.400
It's very rare in ecosystems. There are algal blooms and things like that.

35:59.640 --> 36:05.480
So when we really think about the developmental and the cognitive and the selective niche,

36:06.440 --> 36:12.200
which is a concept that Axel Constant and others have differentiated in some of their

36:12.200 --> 36:21.160
like ecological active inference work, like that niche is very embodied, extended in culture,

36:21.160 --> 36:28.520
et cetera, et cetera. It's just like a kind of cool direct way to open up to that challenge of

36:28.520 --> 36:42.040
modeling and just bring some closures with different accounts or compatibilities with

36:42.040 --> 36:48.600
different accounts. So like all, just to give one right of example, but maybe it'd be interesting

36:48.600 --> 36:57.720
what other people think, all the expressions that people make in social settings can just simply

36:57.720 --> 37:09.480
be their expressions or modeled as such. That is in one way implicitly what was always in play,

37:11.160 --> 37:22.120
but now it's describable and legible and autonomous. So how do we take this active

37:22.200 --> 37:28.360
inference collective behavior crossover and think about what it really means

37:30.040 --> 37:33.960
in how we're going to be like thinking differently, even just this discussion forward

37:34.680 --> 37:45.320
or like more locally are our understandings with collective behavior or with behavior.

37:52.120 --> 38:18.600
Yeah, and you can you ask the question again. I didn't actually catch the

38:19.160 --> 38:30.520
question. How do we start to adapt some of these general comments or frames that are

38:31.240 --> 38:37.720
in some ways disconnected from descriptions of real systems? How do we think about that

38:38.040 --> 38:44.520
and and what it means now?

38:44.520 --> 38:56.120
Do you mean on the document in front of us? These disconnected things in front of us

38:56.120 --> 39:02.840
there on the document? I don't know whatever you think or whatever you want to say.

39:08.040 --> 39:16.840
Yeah, I think there's a lot and again I hope I'm not

39:19.880 --> 39:26.520
fully understanding the question. I hope I'm not steering away too much, but I had a general

39:26.520 --> 39:35.160
sense of what I think you were saying and I think it's an enormous problem with the amount of

39:36.120 --> 39:46.520
information sharing just in a with let's just take the generative models of

39:48.280 --> 39:55.640
social media and all of the platforms that are available to us. How much information we are

39:55.640 --> 40:07.960
privy to in any given moment and I'm kind of forgetting the question that you asked.

40:12.440 --> 40:19.720
It's almost as if there is such a high rate of information and data flow that it's really

40:19.720 --> 40:26.920
hard to know what to do with all of it and at least as a human being I'm not saying from machines

40:26.920 --> 40:37.720
but as a psychologist I'm certainly interested in how humans are able to tolerate and respond to

40:37.720 --> 40:55.720
the amount and rate of information that's out there.

40:55.720 --> 41:09.000
I mean this is not the first time this happens right? Like when we went from talking to writing

41:09.000 --> 41:16.120
information then everyone wrote their information and then we have books and then we have libraries

41:16.120 --> 41:23.480
and that's all available and again we have access if you can read right to all the information in

41:23.480 --> 41:33.240
the world so we adapted to I don't know to get careers so we could specify in which type of

41:33.240 --> 41:40.440
information you are going to know more so maybe we need some sort of new career types I don't know

41:40.440 --> 41:48.040
more specification with more information. But is it not is the rate of information

41:48.360 --> 41:55.800
uh flow and increases are not is it not exponential is it not um I don't know it's a crazy amount

41:55.800 --> 42:01.400
on our brains cannot do anything about it so we have to do multidisciplinary things and work

42:01.400 --> 42:09.640
together with others if we want to make something but yeah I don't know maybe we will die of excess

42:09.640 --> 42:13.240
of information

42:40.600 --> 42:49.960
how do people feel like active inference brings something to the discussion relative to

42:51.320 --> 42:53.240
how they want to work towards

42:53.240 --> 43:11.560
answer yeah well isn't that the provocative question too but like any system that's that

43:11.560 --> 43:16.920
that's the question everyone is going to have their own memes and themes and and systems that they

43:17.720 --> 43:21.320
have spent time with and did fieldwork with and all this other like

43:21.400 --> 43:26.600
particularity because a system that doesn't have particularity is just not going to be

43:27.800 --> 43:36.200
hosting a broad enough niche for for phenotypic diversity it's just riding on the edge of a

43:36.200 --> 43:42.200
razor instead of more like a fabric that continues to unfold I think

43:42.280 --> 43:53.160
there's a lot of work to do with the social sciences and active inference just from what I was

43:53.720 --> 43:57.080
like reading trying to find things for this

43:59.080 --> 44:06.200
um discussion and just I personally wondered what is is meaningful or interesting

44:06.600 --> 44:15.480
or useful what's epistemic and pragmatic value for different audiences how does it go from kind of

44:16.600 --> 44:26.200
bringing citations that were not linked together in some more theoretical or more

44:26.200 --> 44:33.400
generative model oriented work in active inference like epistemic foraging or the

44:33.400 --> 44:40.120
inference model or any other kind of specific model what what are these different kinds of

44:40.120 --> 44:42.520
scientific artifacts do

44:45.960 --> 44:56.840
for who

44:56.840 --> 45:05.720
I guess I'm still learning very

45:09.160 --> 45:09.560
very

45:12.440 --> 45:18.360
kind of crudely ploddling along here Daniel with to try and answer that because it's

45:18.360 --> 45:24.280
quickly realized that the field is it's so multi-nodal it has so much

45:25.000 --> 45:35.320
and the free energy principle the Bayesian brain even just to psychology has so much

45:35.320 --> 45:41.640
applicability and everyone seeing everyone I meet at these discussions is coming at it from

45:41.640 --> 45:48.920
a different angle and it can be a bit confusing to hear how other people

45:49.800 --> 45:55.400
are applying it how other people are making use of it

45:56.840 --> 46:05.480
in all manner of ways and so I'm still learning how to apply to kind of ring fence the free energy

46:05.480 --> 46:12.680
principle and connect it to psychological processes including collective behavior

46:12.680 --> 46:18.760
and because there's a lot of psychopathology in group think in collective behavior but I'm also

46:19.560 --> 46:23.400
very very interested in its application at the interface of

46:24.920 --> 46:32.760
what happens between a a therapist and a patient and I'm often unlike other

46:33.480 --> 46:41.960
professions who seem who are just by nature of the scientific method are able to extract

46:42.840 --> 46:55.800
a lot more data to work with to analyze to you know in a that's very hard to do I feel very limited

46:56.440 --> 47:00.360
other than just making kind of theoretical leaps and inferences about how to apply

47:02.840 --> 47:11.560
the free energy principle to psychology. I can't have a session with my brain hooked up to

47:12.040 --> 47:20.840
an FMRI machine to get data and to see when a patient says Google bar that's a spike on the

47:20.840 --> 47:27.160
spike trains which represents you know surprising and we can then solve for that in some way and

47:27.160 --> 47:33.400
I don't have access to that sort of data flow so it feels limited but I'm still learning how to

47:34.040 --> 47:49.320
apply it and yeah and trying to collaborate with colleagues on that the influence group.

47:55.480 --> 48:01.400
What are people wondering about collective behavior even if we're totally of course not

48:01.400 --> 48:05.160
going to address it but just what what are the kinds of things that people

48:09.240 --> 48:15.800
what makes you look up collective behavior instead of just behavior or individual behavior.

48:16.760 --> 48:30.280
For me it's about safety and need to belong.

48:30.360 --> 48:37.160
For me it's

48:40.040 --> 48:46.360
I think that it depends where you come from and in the country you are but

48:47.080 --> 48:52.040
there are places that are more collective and there are places that are more individualistic and I

48:52.040 --> 48:58.120
think mostly non-western countries have a lot of collective behavioral knowledge and

48:58.840 --> 49:06.440
spirits already right that they're already new these things that we think are new for us right how

49:06.440 --> 49:13.560
the collective thing works for example I don't know you don't make a decision for yourself

49:13.560 --> 49:20.360
you make a decision for the group like marrying you marry because you want an addition you want to

49:20.360 --> 49:26.440
interact with someone or other group and that's something that affects the the collective not

49:26.440 --> 49:32.840
just you so arranged marriage makes sense something like that right so for me making that

49:32.840 --> 49:38.040
distinction about individual collective comes from understanding that I don't know there are

49:38.040 --> 49:43.720
other places that are already ahead in what collective means in terms of human beings and

49:43.720 --> 49:49.320
how to interact and the worst through all we have all this individualistic thing which is

49:50.040 --> 49:57.480
very interesting because why do we have a same species and then we have very different approaches

49:57.480 --> 50:03.000
of how to understand ourselves in terms of what the individual is and why it matters

50:03.160 --> 50:20.440
yes there's so much loaded on different understandings among people including

50:20.440 --> 50:26.440
even the the essence of the social which is who are people and what is the

50:27.320 --> 50:38.920
the obligation and how do we view that that relationship that's a very very deep area and

50:38.920 --> 50:43.320
and again the part that just kept returning to me in the lecture and when I was trying to think

50:43.320 --> 50:52.680
about how to how to even reflect part of this very large area is like what is the adjective doing

50:52.920 --> 51:00.600
and what what is what's the reference point by which this is being said in the speech acts

51:01.240 --> 51:09.160
like people often will dismiss I don't mean to you know straw people but dismiss collective

51:09.160 --> 51:13.800
behavior by saying well we are explaining individual behavior what are you explaining

51:13.800 --> 51:22.440
beyond the estimates in the colony and then the exterior like that is it and so that can feel

51:22.440 --> 51:28.600
like looking at the same thing from two different sides and there are different methods like some

51:28.600 --> 51:35.640
methods blur over individuals a lot more like statistical methods that might correspond to

51:35.640 --> 51:39.720
demographics and then on the other hand like more agent-based models

51:40.680 --> 51:50.680
but how much variability in what shared variability in white general

51:50.680 --> 51:56.360
synchronies amongst different quantum reference frames all these nested

51:57.960 --> 52:06.280
if these possibilities that are grounded in wanting to explore mathematical and scientific

52:06.280 --> 52:13.400
possibilities as as the literature of linear regression is full of so many incredible

52:14.120 --> 52:24.360
extensions and and and similar and then that's I think what the course is even beginning to

52:25.640 --> 52:31.880
to try to express and what what I understand in the works of the the other teachers and

52:31.880 --> 52:38.840
like a lot of your backgrounds and and everything like that is where is that

52:41.240 --> 52:48.120
moment where it is not only science because science is not simply the social

52:49.480 --> 52:54.360
so science has an activity and then as there's a diffusion away from science

52:54.360 --> 53:01.800
and and I think that or or at least that relationship between social and science is

53:01.800 --> 53:09.000
right there in the title maybe that's kind of like a science major's take but but it is itself

53:09.000 --> 53:18.600
in a way a um presenting a dilemma with what science means there and then that's the frame game

53:19.320 --> 53:26.600
who's doing social science who's doing not social science and that's that's where

53:28.120 --> 53:35.480
in in the culture I'm sitting in slash in the technical side of that it is related to statistics

53:35.480 --> 53:47.320
and formality it's the xkcd comic and the way that formalisms and and details are taken as

53:48.360 --> 53:55.560
under some regimes of attention basically definitive and yet there's like a yearning

53:55.560 --> 54:04.760
and a counter balancing that's expressed also in many ways and so that's and science maybe

54:04.760 --> 54:09.720
some people feel like certain social scientific methods that's like not far enough in this dimension

54:09.720 --> 54:16.120
and then the others feel like they're too far in this direction but it's like just like any

54:16.120 --> 54:21.720
like that academic field let alone any other community of diverse agents like of course

54:21.720 --> 54:30.280
there's going to be distributions of perspectives at different times and and at takes rate of

54:30.280 --> 54:40.680
uptake by those different perspectives and no yeah Daniel do you think uh these first principles

54:43.000 --> 54:51.560
would be able to explain why uh an ant colony exists uh I know that was your um a kind of

54:51.560 --> 54:59.080
area of interest of study uh why an ant colony exists uh in in the way that it is as a kind of

54:59.080 --> 55:10.840
operating as a collective and why um another animal is able to survive and achieve its goals

55:13.800 --> 55:20.520
as an individual only relying on the environment and its actions and sensations to get its needs

55:20.520 --> 55:28.360
met and to no doubt minimize its free energy but could first principles explain why the one

55:28.360 --> 55:34.360
has to survive as a group and the other has to survive or is able to survive um and the different

55:34.360 --> 55:43.480
conditions yeah that's a super interesting question it's it's very core to this individual

55:43.480 --> 55:51.560
individuation and multi-scale individuation concept like is the nest made the individual and

55:51.560 --> 55:57.640
then the colony is the social because then for sure it's super collaborative or is the colony

55:57.720 --> 56:04.280
the organism and the nest mates are tissues and then are they social across colony boundaries

56:04.280 --> 56:08.520
not where I was in Arizona but they're often friendly across different species and they

56:08.520 --> 56:14.040
avoided conflict more often than not so it's like well and then go it why does it even matter

56:14.040 --> 56:21.240
what's happening on this plot of lands in this in this area from like a biomimic

56:21.240 --> 56:28.680
perspective we might learn new algorithms it's a sandbox for learning new techniques and

56:28.680 --> 56:34.520
observation all these other like richnesses so it's to say though like what comes away from that

56:35.080 --> 56:43.400
science that makes it social science and I think there's a lot of disciplinary ways of

56:43.400 --> 56:49.160
understanding that which which I'm definitely not expert in in in the um professional fields like

56:49.560 --> 56:57.320
counseling but probably in in all the different humanities and histories and all these other

56:57.320 --> 57:09.720
fields all these different maps the kind of social um the epistemic organizing question

57:11.080 --> 57:18.120
and then the social organizing question yeah and and the way like technology is also in that

57:18.120 --> 57:26.520
tangle and yeah someone pointed out like this is not a new problem and uh but then it's like well

57:26.520 --> 57:31.080
what parts are new and then what's our model by which we're saying that it's like new or two

57:31.080 --> 57:35.640
individualists or two collective on what scale what if they're like really collectivist at this

57:35.640 --> 57:43.960
scale but not at this scale or another an example of an ambiguous or at least like um poly poly

57:43.960 --> 57:50.280
submits phenotype of colonies is in some colonies there's partial reproductive activation

57:50.920 --> 58:00.600
of like non reproductive nests and that has often been modeled from like a position of like

58:00.600 --> 58:07.080
zero is the law and how are they cheating above this but it's also been approached from a

58:07.080 --> 58:16.120
colony level strategic bed hedging so without super deep knowledge of really some of the specifics

58:16.120 --> 58:24.600
of the regularities that that colony algorithm had to persist for so long and to have gotten swept

58:24.600 --> 58:30.760
off the table if it was even it's like that's that's a very integrated problem so it helps you

58:30.760 --> 58:35.800
approach collective systems and and learn about them but it's like there's a lot to say about

58:35.880 --> 58:44.600
humidity loss in foraging and humidity loss isn't even the whole picture and human foraging is a

58:44.600 --> 58:52.360
lot more sophisticated from just like a perception cognition influence perspective

58:54.280 --> 59:00.440
so those are just some ant related thoughts but it's it just centers a lot of discussions that

59:00.440 --> 59:06.760
really matter and I think the really interesting piece is not always in the way that they're

59:07.480 --> 59:14.920
thought to by some yeah and it's and it's very hard to get any kind of

59:15.880 --> 59:24.600
cross pollination or to see cross pollination uh studying one agent it's it's quite for at least

59:24.600 --> 59:29.960
in my mind very difficult to kind of generalize things across different agents and it starts

59:29.960 --> 59:42.840
getting a bit uh yeah tricky to infer one collectives and uh how and why and and how

59:42.840 --> 59:50.360
they survive and how another agent does it's tricky so I'm almost just kind of an agent

59:50.360 --> 59:55.560
human beings as hard as they are to study and just try and run with it as far as possible

59:56.520 --> 01:00:02.280
yeah otherwise it's just information overload

01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:22.120
body's a complex place too and digital technology virtuality these are such um

01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:26.520
richly developed topics in the social sciences I only know the tiniest amount from

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:35.720
but I think that through participation and inclusion in collaboration and in conversations

01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:46.520
and everything there's going to be a lot of interesting connections and paths um and

01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:55.480
and it's being approached seemingly uh multiple layers like within the the two layers that just

01:00:55.480 --> 01:01:02.200
we can focus most narrowly on it's like within the realm of science what is science which is

01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:08.520
kind of like playing this other um role with inertia in some people's minds and in systems

01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:12.120
what is science who gets to decide what social sciences I don't know I'm I'm not in social

01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:19.080
science but it's system of interest in society and certainly I'm a part of that um so it's like

01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:29.480
what is the what is good technically what is social scientific and then what is that social

01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:36.120
scientific how does that going to interface into the the metaphysical questions and and the normative

01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:46.280
ethical and um decision making with trade-offs and the real reflexive complex decisions that matter

01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:56.120
also while recognizing this increasingly nuanced way of thinking about different social intelligences

01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:14.120
what's any other random thought or curiosity about collective behavior

01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:32.280
one point that I would have added into the uh lecture was just that in distributed systems

01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:40.840
whether as modeled or as such all behavior is arising from interactions local to individuals

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:45.080
even if it's sent through some wireless mechanism it's like all about the local interactions

01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:54.680
and so that is a an arising type process that gives the modeler like one hands-off layer

01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:04.680
at least if not much more another nice feature about them um they are in a way

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:13.160
waiting to be composed because they intrinsically contain like at least two layers of consideration

01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:19.160
now whether there's kind of like a forcing function of one layer and just sort of dangling

01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:24.040
a bottom layer or whether there's a lot of what we would call emergence or discussive in in that way

01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:31.640
like that more arising function can be modeled but in either way then you can kind of wrap

01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:38.360
that two-layer system and then compose them so that's like what enables in certain situations

01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:45.720
like parallelization or at least you know that's obviously a big area but that's what allows multi

01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:53.160
agent simulation frameworks to do well on certain very challenging

01:03:54.760 --> 01:04:01.640
sense making and action selection problems not by guarantee or default because any given

01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:08.200
slicing and dicing of any given um prompting of information may not help you adapt

01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:18.440
but there are paths that do and don't help persist or not and that's this kind of persistence

01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:30.360
starting place that we began with Sasha um can I really resonate with what you mentioned about

01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:42.120
the local interactions that even if information is transmitted over long distances then the agents

01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:49.960
behave in a way that is locally relevant and integrates that information and it actually

01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:59.560
makes me think a lot about the like psychology therapy angle that while you try to get information

01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:08.920
about persons like um sort of local environment and behavior um or like perhaps you know demographics

01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:17.240
and age that um their informational environment and like wealth of what kind of information they

01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:30.280
consume might also be really telling about their uh psychological and like behavior interactions or

01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:41.800
pathologies um and then to bring it kind of full circle back to um that the researcher is part of

01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:54.760
the ecosystem that they are uh studying um yeah I I think it's just um such a difference in

01:05:54.760 --> 01:06:01.240
perspective to see that as like a positive and a gift that um the way that you would design and

01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:07.160
run an experiment today is not the way that you would do it two years from now with more experience

01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:16.920
and so um that is a a a benefit and like a bonus in the system and not um like a negative

01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:24.920
perspective of bias that it's detracting from some underlying uh truth or reality

01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:28.360
so just a few thoughts

01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:37.960
oh very interesting anyone want to add something

01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:50.520
I think we didn't fully resolve this early question about the umvelte um term from ethology

01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:58.200
behavioral research observation science uh using the term to describe the world as its experience

01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:04.360
by a particular organism I think a few different pieces and there's a lot of discussion in discourse

01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:10.680
or just just to give it like a super short overview the world we might connect to world

01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:17.960
modeling and there's a lot of interesting work in all kinds of different like pros focus on

01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:24.920
qualitative systems as well as some artificial or synthetic intelligence world modeling as it

01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:31.720
experienced as it is experienced is one of the sticky and deep ones because this is the area

01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:39.480
phenomenology and so this is like a kind of semi-eternal discussion point so whether whether

01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:46.280
active inference delivers on world modeling is kind of empirical and just plain whereas as it

01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:52.440
is experienced is going to be a philosophical question and then by a particular organism

01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:58.920
that specificity we get by actually making the generative model even if we're just speculating

01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:06.840
about it it's like talking about experience without an experiencer would be like talking about um

01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:16.360
some agent's behavior without reference to its niche and then where there is like that complex

01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:24.360
negotiation I think the humanities and a lot of the social sciences have identified a lot of the

01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:34.840
structural top down and also the personal bottom up motifs of of things being

01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:44.440
blurred and made complex and so I think part of the social and the scientific as

01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:54.280
coming only from scientific side is like to to meet in a third space and or at least make it work

01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:57.080
to have a mutual compromise where it's like

01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:04.920
certain social science social oriented claims based upon this scientific measure

01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:10.120
that is going to be a judgment call but understanding that conversation where is it a

01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:17.080
mutual compromise and like what dimensions not simply along the kind of like rigor accessibility

01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:24.040
or implications axis there's just very many things in play in these iterated relationships in ecosystems

01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:43.800
like having a researcher as part of the ecosystem well what is it here's here's the forager question

01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:48.920
you see the nested on the ground it's a forager but then we step back it's like okay well it's foraging

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:57.320
and then that's the allocation of the forager then it's foraging is still part of this sense

01:09:57.320 --> 01:10:04.520
making is generative sense making with like process understanding even of a trace which is something

01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:10.120
that Bruno Latour and others have have explored with like following a trace in a social setting

01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:18.360
and using that to to trace networks so in our digital ecosystems though our information ecosystems

01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:26.200
is not research happening and so what what does that really mean and then what what are those

01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:33.160
social normativeities there's going to be like a meeting or a handoff with with where that really

01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:45.800
is happening or maybe it's a knocking on the door that's ignored or it could be whatever

01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:51.960
metaphor in that setting it actually is there's no general metaphor because that'd be like oh what's

01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:59.000
the general metaphor on this experiment which experiment just the general action that we play

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:12.200
the sake oh hard to say

01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:36.120
okay well in our last like actions I guess if anybody types a question live chat we'll look

01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:49.400
at it otherwise what are any other thoughts or like what what can we learn more about about

01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:55.400
collective behavior or what will it mean for our sense making decision making if we understand

01:11:55.400 --> 01:12:08.600
collective behavior better

01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:26.300
you

01:12:56.280 --> 01:13:02.920
what else are people excited about for the rest of the course

01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:13.160
like based upon the sections that we've done so far

01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:26.200
and and how we can even even start to approach this in an acknowledged limited finite way

01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:30.120
yeah Sasha then than anyone else

01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:39.480
I just added a question to the very bottom of the notes and it makes me think about

01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:46.280
how working on this document collaboratively throughout the last hour we're able to

01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:55.480
kind of leave a stigmatic trace of things we've discussed and what sort of traits or practices

01:13:55.480 --> 01:14:03.000
should individual humans I guess I should specify humans should be embodied in order to improve

01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:09.880
cohesion in collective behavior it makes me think of certain psychology

01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:18.680
traits or descriptions of like openness or conscientiousness

01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:29.880
what will make individual humans better participants in collective behavior

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:47.560
yeah I think to to add to that to just emphasize the importance again only with human agents

01:14:48.680 --> 01:14:56.120
specifically who have the capacity to think and reflect and the only ones that have that those

01:14:57.080 --> 01:15:03.800
really advanced capabilities that we know of as yet but to really kind of leverage

01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:12.600
in order to make the collective better there's a responsibility on the individual

01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:19.560
despite being part of a collective and on many different on many different fronts to be able to

01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:28.200
leverage and utilize their own internal states and what they have learned and to be able to think

01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:37.640
to retain the individual the individual's mind and think about the collective I think is so

01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:46.440
important if the collective is to become healthier Sasha to your point and to improve its

01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:57.560
you have to become more conscientious and become more responsible or whatever that might be

01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:06.360
so to always try and maintain a thinking

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:18.120
self is crucial in words you can very easily be usurped into the collective as is

01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:24.200
if you just go on any social media media platform you will see

01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:28.760
individuals rarely thinking

01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:36.600
for themselves and seemingly kind of just purely in each other and that causes massive problems

01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:44.200
so an individual mind is strikes me as being just the most important thing in the future going forward

01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:57.960
yeah this dialectic with individuation and collectivization as these like ongoing

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:03.960
negotiated compromises that can be also viewed many ways however they are

01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:14.120
cognitive science coming into play

01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:24.040
maybe historical processes or philosophies were

01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:29.880
used in many settings for

01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:38.680
even approaching these kinds of social questions and now with computer science and technology

01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:47.000
it even like is a discussion more about the capacities of measurement and action

01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:53.400
not that those are new in and of themselves like but thinking like a state like the development

01:17:53.400 --> 01:18:01.000
of the apparatus the development of the social social systems that can be run on on open source

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:11.000
hardware open source software things like that so I don't know if something's generalized across

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:22.440
all such groups but understanding what environments at least initially things are beginning at

01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:32.360
is just a realist starting point probably no guarantee since most things slash all things

01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:43.160
are swept off the table in their specifics anyway so and how to deal with that kind

01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:50.840
of like skin on the line type of decision making is very interesting how it's pursued

01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:58.440
in the in the sciences because often like many runs are presented or that kind of like like

01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:02.840
catastrophic failure mode of models is is not considered just like part of the training starting

01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:14.200
naive so just the way that different social considerations are converged upon it's never

01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:20.760
it's not like reduced to one feature of the social because the social is such an open space

01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:28.920
as a scientist always impressed by how that writing could kind of open up

01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:37.800
the um situations which are like mundane but also of course very deep and meaningful

01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:41.400
also though mundane

01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:08.520
you

01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:28.600
any other thoughts or otherwise uh on on collective behavior or on the social sciences

01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:34.120
course or anything otherwise people can have any last words if they want

01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:45.720
yeah awesome thank you all for participating David want to add anything
