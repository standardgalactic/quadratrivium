Hello, and welcome, everyone. This is Active Inference, guest stream 77.1. We're here

00:14.480 --> 00:21.640
with Gareth Stubbs, going to be discussing the police hunch. So, Gareth, thank you very

00:21.640 --> 00:29.360
much for joining. Looking forward to your presentation and the discussion we'll have.

00:29.360 --> 00:33.840
Thank you so much for having me, Daniel, and it's an absolute pleasure to be on the stream,

00:33.840 --> 00:39.000
one that I've watched many times, and it's a privilege to be able to talk through the

00:39.000 --> 00:44.200
paper. I'm hoping to give you a little bit of background as to why I wrote the paper,

00:44.200 --> 00:49.600
where I've come from, a little bit of history, talk through the paper itself, and then hopefully

00:49.600 --> 00:55.320
take some interesting questions, if there's anybody watching, or from Daniel himself,

00:55.440 --> 01:03.120
who's always got some very insightful questions to ask. So, if you're all right, Daniel, am I okay to

01:03.120 --> 01:10.520
start and get going? Yeah, okay. So, a little bit of background. So, I'm a relatively new

01:10.520 --> 01:17.240
academic. I was a police officer for 18 years in the UK. I was in a Northern English force,

01:18.360 --> 01:25.000
and during my career, I did a wide range of stuff from like frontline emergency response,

01:25.000 --> 01:30.440
blue lights, to community policing, which is building relationships with the community,

01:30.440 --> 01:37.080
gathering intelligence, and then working on long term problem solving. Through to working in

01:37.080 --> 01:43.160
national strategy, I worked for the College of Policing, and more latterly, the home office,

01:43.160 --> 01:48.760
the inspectorate. And the inspectorate was an organisation where we would inspect police officers

01:48.760 --> 01:54.840
and make sure that the standards of policing and how they recorded and monitored and all that was

01:54.840 --> 02:02.040
up to a particular level. And for the last five years of my policing career, I was studying a

02:02.040 --> 02:09.160
part-time PhD on the side, and you would think, with me having written this paper, it would be a

02:09.160 --> 02:17.800
police decision making or similar, and it wasn't. I actually studied using two theories, which were

02:17.800 --> 02:22.200
representative bureaucracy and social embeddedness, and it was actually about how

02:22.920 --> 02:29.000
new police recruits navigated the police recruitment process via the use of their

02:29.000 --> 02:36.440
social networks. It sounds complicated and convoluted, and it was essentially spent a lot of time

02:37.080 --> 02:42.440
trying to figure out how people gained advantage or disadvantage through their current social networks

02:42.440 --> 02:51.160
whilst trying to get into the police, with the hope of figuring out why our recruitment process

02:51.160 --> 02:58.520
was so discriminatory. And I've been working on publishing from that PhD, I've only just finished

02:58.520 --> 03:04.920
actually, over the last maybe two, three years, whereupon I went out to the Middle East to teach

03:04.920 --> 03:10.280
police officers now. There's two people that I want to discuss during this stream, the first being

03:11.800 --> 03:16.120
two different groups of people, the first one being Professor Friston, who was just amazing

03:16.120 --> 03:22.840
when I contacted him, and the other being two very well known criminologists called Ken Pease

03:23.960 --> 03:33.640
and Jason Roche. And this entire lane or path of study came out of a discussion with them,

03:33.640 --> 03:39.800
because I was talking about very strange decision making that you make while in service.

03:40.440 --> 03:44.280
So you make decisions that other people look at and say, oh, that's a very strange decision,

03:44.280 --> 03:49.080
why did that police officer make that decision? But when you speak to the officer, they're often

03:49.080 --> 03:55.400
able to relate quite a complicated series of past experiences that have led to the decision

03:55.400 --> 04:01.720
that they've made. And it was Ken Pease, who's, again, a very well known criminologist who said

04:01.720 --> 04:07.080
to me, look, you need to read about the Bayesian brain. He said, what you're describing is how

04:07.080 --> 04:16.760
the Bayesian brain works. So he set me on this kind of down the rabbit hole journey, if you like,

04:16.760 --> 04:22.120
and did a lot of reading of the foundational papers around the Bayesian brain, which I found

04:22.120 --> 04:26.840
very complicated because I didn't have a background in mathematics or neuroscience or cognitive

04:26.840 --> 04:33.320
science. So it was kind of like jumping in the deep end. But he recommended a really good

04:33.400 --> 04:38.760
book called Super Forecasters by Tetlock. Some of you may have heard of it, some of you may not

04:38.760 --> 04:45.240
have heard about it, but it's essentially the human art of prediction, like how intuition is made

04:45.880 --> 04:53.800
in the Bayesian brain. And I found the book revelatory because when I look back at my police

04:53.800 --> 04:58.280
experience, I could see the development of my Bayesian brain as time went on and how my decision

04:58.280 --> 05:03.080
making changed. And this was like kind of mixed because we all have our backgrounds and our history.

05:03.080 --> 05:10.120
But when I was at the home office in London, and we were looking at the way that police forces were

05:11.080 --> 05:15.400
organized and governed and all that sort of thing, we could see that there was a general

05:15.400 --> 05:21.720
tendency towards this kind of promotion of the generalist. So a lot of your senior managers

05:21.720 --> 05:25.400
seem to have been able to like bounce around the organization. They've done lots of different

05:25.400 --> 05:30.440
things. Some have been detectives, some have been uniforms, some have been in corporates,

05:30.440 --> 05:35.480
some have been firearms. You had all these different kind of disciplines, if you like.

05:38.040 --> 05:42.600
You ended up with a lot of senior leaders who were jack of all trades and essentially

05:43.880 --> 05:49.160
masters of none. And this was in direct contrast to a lot of the research that looked at teams

05:49.160 --> 05:53.960
of specialists, people with specialist knowledge that have built up very, very solid, what you

05:53.960 --> 05:58.200
could call like Bayesian building blocks when it comes to specialist decision making. And then

05:58.200 --> 06:02.200
when you put them together, the matching of all these specialisms then resulted in higher

06:02.200 --> 06:06.920
performance of external private companies. So we were trying to think about how this might

06:06.920 --> 06:12.840
look in policing. And it was only when I wrote a read super forecasting solid blocks of prediction

06:12.840 --> 06:20.840
that I started to understand how the brain may work. Now, of course, if you at any point go into

06:20.920 --> 06:24.920
YouTube and you type in the Bayesian brain, you're going to get Professor Friston in some way.

06:26.200 --> 06:32.840
So that was my first introduction. And this was probably about two years ago. And I absolutely

06:32.840 --> 06:41.240
devoured all of his podcasts. I mean, everything that I could find. And that kind of linked in a

06:41.240 --> 06:46.360
lot with the LLM development. Obviously, we have the side by side active inference seem to be like

06:46.360 --> 06:52.040
picking up steam like crazy. And then we have the LLMs and the AI research picking up steam.

06:52.040 --> 06:56.120
And then you could see how the two were starting to like twist and merge. And there were some really

06:56.120 --> 07:04.440
good podcasts from Machine Learning Street Talk and Curt Jaimungles podcast theory of everything.

07:05.720 --> 07:09.960
Well, we're talking really long form like two and a half, three hour discussions on this stuff.

07:10.040 --> 07:18.600
And I was just absolutely immersed. And I started to think about how this has never been used in

07:18.600 --> 07:23.560
practice like in policing, you know, like, a lot of the time we go to these training sessions,

07:23.560 --> 07:27.640
you'd have some experienced practitioners talking to you about how they made decisions.

07:27.640 --> 07:32.200
We'd have decision making models and me with my relatively new academic brain was immediately

07:32.200 --> 07:35.880
going straight to Google scholar and saying, okay, what's the empirical basis for these

07:35.880 --> 07:41.000
decision making models? I know everyone's using them. But do we know if they work? Do we know if

07:41.000 --> 07:46.120
they speed up our decision making? Are they better with those who've got better Bayesian

07:46.120 --> 07:51.240
building blocks? Are they not better? So when you start to look at these questions, you realize that

07:52.040 --> 08:00.200
there's almost no research to support police decision making models. And the best stuff

08:00.200 --> 08:05.800
that I found on that is in Andy Clark book, and the experience machine as a full chapter

08:05.800 --> 08:11.880
on looking at police decision making. Anyway, I'm getting slightly distracted. How did I actually

08:11.880 --> 08:19.880
come to the paper? So there was one experience in my service. And I'm going to tell the story

08:19.880 --> 08:26.520
because it's in the paper. If that's all right, Daniel, is that okay? Okay. So I was a

08:27.480 --> 08:31.720
newly promoted sergeant. And that's like a first line supervisor in the police. I had a team of

08:31.720 --> 08:39.480
about 15 police officers. And I was probably about 27, 28 years old. And I was out with one of those

08:39.480 --> 08:45.000
police officers who was new. And he was trying to build his confidence. So I said to him, look,

08:46.200 --> 08:51.320
Jamie, I said, we're going to go to all the bad stuff tonight. So when the nasty incidents come

08:51.320 --> 08:55.160
in, we're going to go and I'm going to see if I can work with you on building your confidence in

08:55.160 --> 08:59.400
these sort of like, you know, these, these high risk situations. And he was all up for it.

09:00.920 --> 09:07.320
And then domestic violence incident came in and the male offender was still inside the

09:08.280 --> 09:12.120
house. And we knew that they've been violent shoes because the person who rang it in was a

09:12.120 --> 09:18.120
neighbor. And the neighbor had said that she was severely injured and bleeding. So because there

09:18.120 --> 09:23.080
was a chance that it could get rough, and we might need to make an arrest straightaway,

09:23.080 --> 09:28.680
I thought this would be good for Jamie to go to. And he was a Taser officer. And I don't know how,

09:28.680 --> 09:33.800
how like, experienced you guys are. So I'll just let you know, but police officers in

09:33.800 --> 09:38.600
England, we don't carry guns like, and there's probably about five or 6% of police officers

09:38.600 --> 09:44.040
that carry guns at the most. And a lot of them are only sent to incidents that may involve firearms.

09:44.040 --> 09:52.120
So the vast majority of incidents we go to, we have a baton, she's like a stick, and a spray.

09:53.080 --> 09:57.560
And they're the, they're the two bits that we've got to deal with it. Now Jamie had just got his

09:57.560 --> 10:04.120
Taser, and he was trying to build his confidence. And so we turned up, there was a very injured

10:04.120 --> 10:08.680
lady on the sidewalk, she was pulling clumps out of her hair, she'd been clearly

10:09.720 --> 10:15.480
punched a great deal of face was an absolute mess. And she told us that he was still inside the

10:15.480 --> 10:21.480
male offender. And obviously, he would be violent towards us as police officers. Now that if you

10:21.480 --> 10:28.520
read the paper, this may come across as if it was a like a kind of a one off incident. It wasn't,

10:28.520 --> 10:33.800
you go to things like this all the time on a busy Friday or Saturday night, I could go to the two

10:33.800 --> 10:42.520
or three of these maybe. So this was very, very normal, nothing out of the ordinary. And I said

10:42.520 --> 10:46.920
to Jamie, okay, well, let's go on. We'll wait for some backup because he might be violent,

10:46.920 --> 10:51.400
this guy and you know, we'll go in and we'll see what we can do. He's obviously going to need to

10:51.400 --> 11:00.360
be arrested because of the damage that he'd done to the lady. And she said, no, I've got my one year

11:00.360 --> 11:06.440
old upstairs and he's in bed. And the minute that she said that, like, we can't wait for backup,

11:06.440 --> 11:13.160
we have to go in because there's a chance that the child could be injured. So obviously that

11:13.160 --> 11:17.000
changed our decision making. And as we're working up the front door up to the front door, the door

11:17.000 --> 11:24.200
opens and this big muscley guy comes to the front door. And the thing that got me at that time,

11:24.840 --> 11:28.520
and again, I just have to stress like I got these with the very, very normal incidents,

11:28.520 --> 11:33.320
like we'd go to these all the time, there's something about this incident where I felt

11:33.320 --> 11:40.840
like my heart hit my stomach, big adrenaline dump, all of the prickles on my arm stood up,

11:40.840 --> 11:45.960
like my hair stood up, power reaction, and up the back of my neck. And I remember looking at

11:45.960 --> 11:50.040
Jamie, Jamie didn't feel this and I spoke to him afterwards. It was really strange because

11:50.040 --> 11:55.480
there was two of us presented with the same incoming sensory stimuli. I had a very different

11:55.480 --> 12:00.440
bodily reaction. And we talked about it afterwards. I mean, at the time, I would like to say I was

12:00.440 --> 12:05.240
eight or nine years of experience, Jamie was like coming up to two. So there was a big buildup of

12:05.880 --> 12:13.480
abasing priors in me for some reason. Anyway, let's cut long story short. We ended up fighting with

12:13.480 --> 12:21.400
the male. He was very violent towards us, really, really bad incident. And when we finally got him

12:21.400 --> 12:24.920
in handcuffs, as we got to the front door, we noticed that he dropped a knife and he'd had

12:24.920 --> 12:30.920
the knife when I pulled him out of the doorway. Now, this is like one of those moments that you

12:30.920 --> 12:35.240
have in a policing career where your mortality punches you in the face, you know, because

12:35.240 --> 12:39.160
had we gone inside or had we engaged him in a very different way, there's a chance that

12:39.720 --> 12:46.200
both of us would not have come away from the incident. And sometimes that like hits you and

12:46.200 --> 12:53.160
it hit us both then. And Jamie got very upset. I remember it very distinctly. We walked into the

12:53.160 --> 12:57.880
kitchen, we had to go and check that the young lad was okay. And he was. And obviously, we got the

12:57.880 --> 13:03.720
injured party back into the house. But I remember doing like an immediate reflection afterwards

13:03.720 --> 13:11.480
and saying to Jamie, like, I have never had this severity of bodily reaction like that

13:13.400 --> 13:18.760
that came on so quickly. And I've used the word salience to describe it in the paper.

13:19.400 --> 13:23.800
But there was something that was distinctly different. And I don't know what it was. But

13:23.880 --> 13:28.600
obviously, whatever signals I was receiving, be it from the lady on the curb or from the

13:28.600 --> 13:33.720
male's behavior as we approached door, there was something in me that told me intraceptively. So

13:33.720 --> 13:40.040
it was an internal feeling that then triggered my cognitive processes to approach the incident

13:40.040 --> 13:47.560
differently. Anyway, that incident, obviously he went to court, he went to jail actually.

13:48.520 --> 13:53.400
So the incident itself, we managed to safeguard the lady in the sun, which is always a good outcome.

13:54.760 --> 14:00.280
But for me, it really stuck with me for a couple of reasons. The first was that the bodily reaction

14:00.280 --> 14:05.800
that was so different was something that Jamie didn't receive at all. So there was no difference in

14:05.800 --> 14:13.960
him. He saw nothing of the evidence that I saw. And when I say saw, this is obviously, and again,

14:13.960 --> 14:18.120
covering the paper, there's so much information that you're taking into these incidents. And it's

14:18.120 --> 14:24.520
in such a temporal window that such a tight temporal window that your ability to be able to

14:24.520 --> 14:31.400
affect the environment that you're in is very, very highly constrained. Because you're only going to

14:31.400 --> 14:38.360
be at that incident, maybe for minutes, if you're lucky, an hour or over, depending on how busy

14:38.360 --> 14:45.000
the radio is. So you can't do what you would call any longitudinal niche, niche construction,

14:45.000 --> 14:50.600
your ability to mold or shape your environment when you turn up as a police officer is limited

14:50.600 --> 14:55.000
solely to the time that you're there. And because you don't know any of the people there,

14:57.000 --> 15:00.920
there's something going on in the police officer's brain. And again, this is discussed in the paper

15:00.920 --> 15:11.640
that is very different to a normal work environment. So I'm just going to, I'll try my best to give

15:11.640 --> 15:16.520
you an example. So if you work on a till and customer services, you have a very predictable

15:16.520 --> 15:21.720
way of living your day out. And of course, the unpredictability comes from the customers.

15:21.720 --> 15:26.520
But there's often a set of like procedures or protocols that you follow that enable you to

15:26.520 --> 15:31.720
deal with those people in a particular way. And that allows you to predict your work and hopefully

15:31.720 --> 15:36.760
comfortably do that. Now, when you're a police officer, you have the law. And this was interesting

15:36.760 --> 15:41.320
actually, Daniel, because when we first had a chat about this, I think you put me in touch with

15:41.320 --> 15:45.960
somebody who was talking about the law as an agent of active inference, which is proper

15:45.960 --> 15:51.480
interesting stuff. And if we get time, like later on, it might be worth a discussion. But

15:52.520 --> 15:57.400
the officers are working within the law. So you've got bounds, if you like, you have boundaries that

15:57.400 --> 16:04.440
you work within. And there's particular actions you can take. But everything is so highly

16:04.440 --> 16:09.000
unpredictable. I'm not working with a till and working directly with people. It's often in a

16:09.000 --> 16:12.680
very, very emotionally charged environment, because that's why police get called in the

16:12.680 --> 16:17.400
first place. You don't know any of the people that you're dealing with, and they're not coming to you

16:17.400 --> 16:21.400
asking for the same service. So it's not like you're going up to a shop and saying, I want to buy

16:21.400 --> 16:26.680
this again and again and again, which is the same thing that you'd get as a cashier. When we turn

16:26.680 --> 16:34.360
up, a lot of the time, people don't even want police there. So you come in as like a kind of alien,

16:34.360 --> 16:38.600
if you like, and there's often something that again, it's like high emotions, everything's

16:38.600 --> 16:43.560
going a little bit crazy. The decision making of those people is normally totally out of the norm.

16:43.560 --> 16:48.520
You're trying to bring everything back within the norm. So if you like that the officer is like

16:48.520 --> 16:52.360
an agent of our status, we're trying to bring back home your status to the environment and get there.

16:53.320 --> 16:59.320
But it's so messy, and so difficult, that you often end up making decisions that other people

16:59.320 --> 17:03.480
may look at and say, Oh, why have they done that? It's such a strange decision. But if you've been,

17:04.200 --> 17:08.920
and I suppose in the paper when I go through it, if you've been in that particular situation a

17:08.920 --> 17:14.760
number of times before, and you have a good set of Bayesian building blocks that allow you to make

17:14.760 --> 17:19.480
but improve decision making as a result of that experience, you may end up with improved outcomes.

17:20.120 --> 17:28.600
And I'm not going to say that you will, but you may. And it's a solid theory to back up

17:28.680 --> 17:33.480
good experience led decision making. And there's lots of things that you can look at. And hopefully

17:33.480 --> 17:38.120
the paper towards the end might be able to just talk about some of those and I can take the viewers

17:38.120 --> 17:45.160
through them. So that's the kind of background. The salience of this particular incident is the

17:45.160 --> 17:50.440
one that the paper is based on. It was so different to me during my police career that I needed

17:50.440 --> 17:58.440
something that explained it. This theory explains it in a lovely way. It's so nice. And obviously the

17:58.600 --> 18:06.200
kind of absorption of Carl Friston's work over time and the reading of the books. I mean,

18:06.200 --> 18:11.720
that's inference book by Thomas Pye. I know that you're doing a series on it, a reading group on it.

18:11.720 --> 18:16.440
It's brilliant. I would say it's a little bit hard going. Don't pick it up as your first book.

18:16.440 --> 18:20.520
Do some listening to the podcast first, try and get your head around how it all works,

18:20.520 --> 18:24.040
and then pick up the book and go through it. It gets a little bit heavy towards the end.

18:24.040 --> 18:27.960
The experience machines are really good introduction. That's another good one. Andy Clark

18:27.960 --> 18:32.520
talks about Active Inference Book. It's not an active inference book. It gives you a much wider

18:32.520 --> 18:38.440
view on the cognitive neuroscience and how the active inference stuff is brought in.

18:39.080 --> 18:43.880
But I really enjoyed that. And then obviously, when I'd had this idea and I'd written most of

18:43.880 --> 18:48.280
the paper, I think I was at maybe, you know, six and a half, seven thousand words. I took the

18:48.280 --> 18:55.480
lead and I emailed Mr. Friston. And I just emailed Professor Friston with a massive

18:56.280 --> 19:01.960
chunk of humble pie and said, Professor, lovely to meet you. I feel like I know you because I've

19:01.960 --> 19:08.120
watched you a million times online. This is what I've written. What do you think? And then

19:09.480 --> 19:17.720
to my surprise, he sent me back another 800 words or so with a very heavy endorsement.

19:19.880 --> 19:22.520
I was a little bit in shock. It's one of those moments where I was looking at my computer and

19:22.520 --> 19:27.640
I was like, is that an email from? Oh my goodness. And then I opened the manuscript and I was like,

19:27.640 --> 19:35.000
wow, okay, this is amazing. And then obviously a little bit more dialogue and we chose to

19:35.720 --> 19:40.440
submit, but needless to say, and I mentioned this earlier in the podcast because I don't have a

19:40.440 --> 19:47.000
background in maths or neuroscience. I'm fairly sure that those holes were evident in that first

19:47.000 --> 19:54.200
draft. And Mr. Friston did an absolutely amazing job of plugging them. So I guess that's the story

19:54.200 --> 20:02.440
behind the research, Daniel. Did that make sense? Yes, you good with that? Yeah, thank you.

20:04.200 --> 20:09.240
Okay. Have you got any questions so far or do you want me to just wait through the paper quickly?

20:09.240 --> 20:14.920
Yeah, let's look through the paper. Okay, cool. I'll just go to share screen then.

20:17.000 --> 20:24.840
Okay.

20:31.400 --> 20:39.640
Okay, is that? Yep, looks like. Okay, perfect. So I don't want to read the paper only because I think

20:39.640 --> 20:44.840
everybody will dive boredom, but I will skip through the sections and explain to you my thinking.

20:45.560 --> 20:55.320
So I go very gently into setting the scene, talk a little bit about how police officers are often

20:55.320 --> 20:59.880
flung into what you would call vital high-stakes situations. And this is elaborated on a little

20:59.880 --> 21:04.120
bit further, but it's that temporal nature of the decision making, which I think causes very

21:04.120 --> 21:08.440
specific grooves in the police officer's brain. And I'm using the word groove because I think it's

21:08.440 --> 21:12.680
a really good analogy that kind of like explains the brain. It's not that we can't step out of the

21:12.680 --> 21:17.160
groove, but they help us make decisions. And I suppose that's in line with heuristics. It's

21:17.160 --> 21:22.520
actually in line with like hemispheric theory, like all sorts of like, and I talk about this later,

21:22.520 --> 21:28.200
like system one, system two thinking. This is all quite well-established, good psychological

21:28.200 --> 21:34.520
research. It all kind of melds together. It gives you a good little background. So I talk about a

21:34.520 --> 21:41.960
little bit of the history with regards to the hunch and what the hunch is. It's been described

21:42.040 --> 21:47.720
using a number of different terms. So we've got suspicion in here. This was done on research that

21:47.720 --> 21:53.480
was conducted when it comes to things like stop and search. And stop and search is such a

21:54.840 --> 22:02.040
contentious area of policing. So high impact when it comes to things like community tension,

22:02.040 --> 22:09.640
community confidence, trust, safety, legitimacy, a lot of it is linked with the use or the abuse

22:09.640 --> 22:16.600
of stop and search. So there's been quite a lot of study that's looked at the decision to stop

22:16.600 --> 22:23.000
and the decision to search, how those decisions are created and often through ethnographies,

22:23.000 --> 22:29.320
where academics have gone out with police officers and watched officers conduct their

22:30.920 --> 22:36.280
stops and their searches and how they've then asked after that's been done like,

22:36.280 --> 22:40.200
how did you make that decision? How have you come to that decision to stop and search that person?

22:40.200 --> 22:45.480
What was going on inside your brain? And I've then introduced the domestic violence incident,

22:45.480 --> 22:49.560
which I've already discussed, so I'm not going to go through that. But I've just talked about this

22:49.560 --> 22:53.640
bit here where it says this scenario creates fundamental question. How does an officer's

22:53.640 --> 22:59.320
body generate these hunches, these internal alarm bells, and what role do they play in

22:59.320 --> 23:05.320
navigating the experience of being a police officer? Now they're not restricted to police

23:05.320 --> 23:12.040
officers and I talk about this here, especially when it comes to things like medicine and public

23:12.040 --> 23:23.560
service based professions, armed forces, firefighting, etc. There's an excellent article and if I could

23:23.560 --> 23:28.760
remember it, I would share it. But it was about a group of firefighters that went in there in the

23:28.760 --> 23:34.360
midst of like, you know, fighting this crazy big fire and all of a sudden the supervisor just says,

23:34.360 --> 23:39.400
right, get out, get out, get out. And he grabs all his team and he pulls them out and literally

23:39.400 --> 23:47.720
within seconds the floor collapses. Now, obviously there's going to be no super particular salient

23:48.280 --> 23:53.400
detail that's made him do that. It's going to be a gathering of details which are going on

23:53.400 --> 24:00.280
often unconsciously in the midst of the fire. Even him, I imagine, can't process in a way that's

24:00.280 --> 24:05.320
rational and deterministic. He can't say this led to this and then this led to this and then this

24:05.320 --> 24:11.240
led to this. It just, this overwhelming feeling came to him as a firefighter and he said, no,

24:11.240 --> 24:17.320
come out, come out quick. And as they came out, the floor collapsed. Now that's an example of the

24:17.320 --> 24:21.560
hunch, but the hunch within a firefighting circumstance. It's the same thing. It's like a

24:21.560 --> 24:27.720
kind of overpowering feeling of intuition. So I talk a little bit about this here and we talk

24:27.720 --> 24:33.240
about it being a little bit wider than stopping a vehicle. There is a discussion here of

24:35.560 --> 24:40.360
almost like the spectrum of what a hunch can be like. How does intuition present itself?

24:40.360 --> 24:44.200
There is some research coming very shortly from somebody called Emily Quinn at Cambridge.

24:45.080 --> 24:49.640
She's just done a PhD in something called the copper's nose, which again is the police hunch.

24:49.640 --> 24:55.800
I didn't know about this until after I'd written it, but I know that she's done a data collection.

24:55.800 --> 25:00.600
I know that she's much more hot on the terminology and the neuroscience and the cognitive science

25:00.600 --> 25:05.320
behind this. And I know that her research is about to land. So just for the listeners,

25:05.320 --> 25:13.080
it's definitely coming. That's going to be a treat when it lands. But a hunch or a copper's

25:13.080 --> 25:16.920
nose when you're trying to find vehicles that may be up to no good, for instance,

25:17.880 --> 25:22.280
I'd been in cars with people who are very experienced police officers and say something

25:22.280 --> 25:27.240
like, I want to stop that car. I don't like the look of it. Now I'm trying to learn and

25:27.240 --> 25:30.520
my immediate question would be like, well, what do you mean you don't like the look of it? What is

25:30.520 --> 25:37.720
it about that car that's promoting this feeling of unease? And even the most experienced police

25:37.720 --> 25:43.720
officers, they can't answer that question. They'll say something like, oh, well, maybe it's the manner

25:43.720 --> 25:49.000
of driving, you know, but if it was the manner of driving, and I might have picked up on it,

25:49.000 --> 25:54.760
there's something else, there's something that's, that's triggering. And I imagine their heuristics

25:54.760 --> 26:00.040
and their heuristics that have built up over time. Again, it'll be Bayesian. There'll be tiny signs,

26:00.040 --> 26:06.600
tiny inputs, sensory inputs about a particular vehicle and the way that it is behaving that

26:06.600 --> 26:13.240
over time have led to the building up of this, this intuition. Now, that is a very, very small

26:13.240 --> 26:17.240
slice of what is intuition, a very, very big slice of what is intuition might come in the

26:17.240 --> 26:21.720
detective world. So if you're working on a murder case, it could be that you have a very

26:21.720 --> 26:27.160
particular feeling about one of the suspects, and that feeling may build up over time. Now, again,

26:27.960 --> 26:32.760
very, very difficult to explain. Why do you, why do you have a feeling that that suspect did or did

26:32.760 --> 26:38.280
not do it? Why, why is it coming? And again, those detectives, and I know I've worked with them,

26:38.280 --> 26:43.320
they can't explain it. There's something that's, that's building up for them and they can feel

26:43.320 --> 26:48.440
the hunch. The hunch isn't something that's visceral. It doesn't come into the pile of erection,

26:48.440 --> 26:53.240
kind of like, you know, like response to threat or response to stimulus that's severe. It's very,

26:53.240 --> 26:57.800
very slow creeping. And it leads to like this. It's almost like intrusive thoughts, you know,

26:57.800 --> 27:02.920
like they're very, very slow. They come in without their unbidden. There's no like kind of, I'm not,

27:03.640 --> 27:08.040
very, very, I'm not happy with this. You know, this is not good. You know, it's uninvited.

27:09.160 --> 27:13.000
So the hunch can manifest itself in lots of different ways from the kind of, I want to stop

27:13.080 --> 27:18.600
that car. I don't like look of it to something that generates over weeks or months. And again,

27:18.600 --> 27:23.800
it's very difficult to discern like, where does that sailings come from? We don't know. We don't

27:23.800 --> 27:28.360
know. And that's one of the things that I think that should be looked at. And I discussed this at

27:28.360 --> 27:34.920
the end when we talk about where the research could go. So again, I take them through the incident

27:34.920 --> 27:39.080
which I've just discussed. And we talk a little bit about the background of intuition research.

27:40.040 --> 27:44.360
And then we talk about rational decision making and intuition. There's a meta study there

27:44.360 --> 27:50.280
from Wang, Wang et al. in 2017. He's talking about constructs and think they are separate.

27:50.280 --> 27:54.600
They've run up on the dual cognitive system, system one, system two again, emotional thinking,

27:54.600 --> 27:58.200
what you would call emotional thinking and rational thinking if you were being a Philistine like me.

28:00.600 --> 28:07.480
So, yes. And then I very, very, tentatively, and I have specifically used that word,

28:07.560 --> 28:11.320
I'll just highlight it there tentatively. With this prior discussion in mind,

28:11.960 --> 28:17.960
the author posits a definition of a hunch for the following discussion, which is an often

28:17.960 --> 28:23.320
unbidden, salient intuition experienced by a police officer that subsequently influences their

28:23.320 --> 28:29.000
actions. Now, when I say influences their actions, I don't mean that it specifically

28:29.000 --> 28:32.520
sends them in a particular direction. That direction can be anywhere. But it's the fact

28:32.520 --> 28:39.000
that it causes some sort of change in direction or causes you to consider a change in direction

28:39.000 --> 28:44.760
that then, so in other words, it's instrumental. It's not something that just pops up and it

28:44.760 --> 28:52.440
can be dismissed. It does something. Now, there was some pushback a little bit on the definition.

28:52.440 --> 28:59.160
So words were added as we went in and through from the reviewers who were amazing on the article.

28:59.160 --> 29:05.800
They were so cool, gave lots of different editions or possible editions and talked about this.

29:05.800 --> 29:10.280
And we ended up with this, this inclusion of the word salience to kind of

29:10.280 --> 29:14.760
generate to describe a hunch, you know, like what, well, it's the salience of the hunch.

29:14.760 --> 29:19.320
It's not like a normal hypothesis. Our brain is constantly generating hypotheses all the time.

29:20.120 --> 29:23.400
But there's something about this particular hypothesis when it pops up.

29:24.040 --> 29:29.080
Wham, it hits you. Okay. Well, what does that hit feel like? Where is it come from?

29:29.080 --> 29:33.720
And why is it different to your normal train of thought? What is it that's made it pop out?

29:35.960 --> 29:43.320
And that then leads to the maths. Now, some of the narrative, probably half ish,

29:43.320 --> 29:49.080
that this is mine, some of its calls. And Professor Friston went into a lot more detail than me.

29:49.880 --> 29:54.440
The equation that I put forward for surprise was tripled in length.

29:55.960 --> 30:01.240
So he went into a lot more. This was the Bayesian brain bits. We introduced the Bayesian brain.

30:03.080 --> 30:08.120
If you like the older research. And then we bring in the newer research data, for instance,

30:08.120 --> 30:17.480
free energy principle. And then Professor Friston added the detail in the equations here.

30:17.560 --> 30:22.200
And also the figures, which have come in, which are the background, if you like,

30:22.200 --> 30:25.160
for these equations. How do these equations work? And what do they say?

30:27.000 --> 30:31.320
But what's the gist? So if I was to describe this.

30:33.400 --> 30:36.840
Surprising bounds or the level of surprise that somebody operates within.

30:39.160 --> 30:41.800
A police officer is going to be very, very sensitive

30:42.760 --> 30:47.880
to boundaries of surprise. This is the hypothesis, essentially because,

30:48.600 --> 30:52.280
and I talk about this in the next section, which is about cultural niche construction,

30:53.000 --> 30:56.440
because they have very little control over their environments and they have very little

30:56.440 --> 31:02.120
knowledge of the people within them. I think that their brain will generate hunches

31:03.080 --> 31:09.400
in a much more sensitive fashion within those constraints. So essentially,

31:09.720 --> 31:15.880
and through the gathering of experience, very temporarily informed, if you like,

31:17.560 --> 31:23.080
work environment. If I go to a domestic, and I walk into a domestic incident,

31:23.080 --> 31:26.440
and the male and female are shouting and throwing things at each other, I have,

31:27.080 --> 31:34.440
I have no discretion. I have to take action immediately because there's harm that can

31:34.440 --> 31:41.400
take place at any point to either of the parties. So I have to take what is a very active role in

31:41.400 --> 31:47.000
that environment immediately. And therefore, I'm constantly training my brain, I think, personally,

31:47.000 --> 31:52.280
as a police officer, this is what I think goes on, to take action and to take action decisively

31:52.280 --> 31:59.400
in order to reach desired outcomes. Now, in most people's daily business, they have lots of time

31:59.480 --> 32:04.120
to make these decisions. And as a police officer, you just don't. And that generates

32:05.880 --> 32:09.880
grooves. I think it generates grooves in the police officer's brain, and it leads to something

32:09.880 --> 32:14.280
which has come out in the ethnographic literature around policing called pragmatism.

32:14.280 --> 32:20.200
Now, it's described as a tendency to do over a tendency to think. So a police officer will often

32:20.200 --> 32:27.080
tend, I think, towards jumping into some sort of very active role in the environment,

32:27.880 --> 32:34.920
sometimes too quickly, way too quickly. But I think that too quickly, and I'm going to use

32:34.920 --> 32:41.880
air quotes there, is Bayesian. I think that your brain is trained to intervene quickly

32:41.880 --> 32:47.480
in many, many cases, and it sets up grooves. And those grooves are very easy to fall into.

32:48.520 --> 32:55.720
And that presents risk. So I'll give you an example. If I'm going to be controversial here,

32:55.720 --> 33:01.560
but this is where I think the research will be really cool. If, for instance, there is a drug

33:01.560 --> 33:06.440
problem within a particular neighborhood, and that neighborhood is high in ethnic minority,

33:07.320 --> 33:14.920
and it could be ethnic minority from anywhere. So in the UK, Albanian, for instance,

33:15.800 --> 33:20.200
or it could be black in London, or it could be Afro-Caribbean. There's lots of different

33:20.280 --> 33:26.360
ethnicities. But if there is a community which is heavy in a particular ethnicity,

33:26.360 --> 33:30.360
and as a police officer, you are constantly interacting in what will be

33:31.880 --> 33:37.800
highly temporal niche situations, normally violence-related, with that community,

33:37.800 --> 33:45.320
that's going to influence the way that that officer thinks and reacts in other, maybe less

33:45.960 --> 33:53.480
temporally influenced situations. So I'll give you a physical example. If I am going to

33:55.080 --> 34:00.680
gang-related violence a lot, and I'm dealing with victims that have been injured as a result of

34:00.680 --> 34:07.640
gang-related violence, if I do a stop and search in that same area, and I have been to all these

34:07.640 --> 34:12.760
previous incidents, there's going to be a building up of influence and experience in me, which is

34:12.760 --> 34:19.320
then going to change the way that I behave when I stop that car. And you will see this in the

34:19.320 --> 34:25.800
research, this comes out in a lot of the way that police officers are perceived when they're dealing

34:25.800 --> 34:32.040
with ethnic minorities, the way that police officers act, they're not the same when it comes to

34:32.680 --> 34:39.640
majority population interactions. But I do think, and again, I'm pushing this theory way out from

34:39.640 --> 34:46.440
beyond my paper here, I do think that we can probably find some evidence of why that may be the

34:46.440 --> 34:53.480
case, and maybe prove empirically that the more incidents that you go to that could be highly

34:53.480 --> 34:58.680
temporally influenced, that may involve particular ethnic minorities, could then change the way that

34:58.680 --> 35:03.640
you as a police officer operate on a much more wider scale with members of that ethnicity. Now,

35:05.320 --> 35:08.680
I don't think a lot of that's conscious, and I know because I've worked with police officers,

35:08.920 --> 35:14.920
I mean, I met one racist police officer in my entire service of 18 years. So I know people say

35:14.920 --> 35:18.840
other police officers, police, police are racist, you know, I don't think it's as simple as that.

35:18.840 --> 35:23.320
I think it's way more complicated. I think that we have to really understand why police officers

35:23.320 --> 35:27.720
make the decisions they do over time for us to properly unpick this problem. I don't think it's

35:27.720 --> 35:33.320
something that we can turn the page on. And it's going to be years of good research, some of which

35:33.320 --> 35:39.160
is alluded to in Andy Clark's book. So anyway, I'm going a little bit wide here, but all of this

35:40.120 --> 35:45.880
influences that conversation that I've just had. I'm not going to go into the detail,

35:45.880 --> 35:52.120
but that's the bit that is there. And we have this wonderful addition from him,

35:52.120 --> 35:55.400
which gives you the background to the theory from Professor Friston.

35:57.160 --> 36:01.000
Now, this is the section that if I had the choice, I would have put a lot more

36:01.960 --> 36:06.360
words into. And this is the hundreds of niche construction stuff, and you'll probably be able

36:06.360 --> 36:13.000
to tell that from how I've been talking about it today. But low surprise, longitudinal relationships

36:13.000 --> 36:19.560
probably make up the vast amount of our interpersonal relationships that we all experience on a

36:19.560 --> 36:25.240
day-to-day basis, all of us in general in the world, unless you're in somewhere that's very,

36:25.240 --> 36:30.920
very volatile. Mostly they're going to be low surprise, longitudinal relationships. So you

36:30.920 --> 36:39.160
are going to have more opportunity to mould the environment over time. So that's the active bit

36:39.160 --> 36:43.800
of the influence. So you've got this ability to interact with the environment, the environment

36:43.800 --> 36:49.160
then interacts with you, and you end up with this constantly forward and back in between you and

36:49.160 --> 36:54.600
the environment. The problem is, of course, again, with police officers, the ability to

36:54.600 --> 37:00.520
longitudinally change or influence an environment is just not there. You have, I have an hour at

37:00.520 --> 37:05.160
most of the incident, and then I'm getting sent to another. And that may then cause, I think,

37:05.160 --> 37:12.280
this pragmatic leaning to do rather than think. So that's the kind of what I'm getting to in

37:12.280 --> 37:19.080
this last part here before moving into the discussion. So there's a couple of questions

37:19.080 --> 37:22.280
that I've come up here. I've mentioned the pragmatism here from Loftus. This is from

37:22.280 --> 37:28.280
the cultural literature. So what cognitive signals were generated by initial attendants that

37:28.280 --> 37:32.840
contributed to the hunch generation? When the Bayesian brain processes these signals,

37:32.840 --> 37:37.240
what is produced empirically during the process of active inference? What was the officer's

37:37.240 --> 37:43.960
qualia? So how does the hunch present into consciousness? Massively complicated. And I've

37:43.960 --> 37:48.360
even put it in the paper. We don't want to get into the consciousness debate because it's

37:49.320 --> 37:55.800
absolutely fascinating, but it's just incredibly complicated. So there are some things here that

37:55.800 --> 38:00.280
make that person aware. And this refers to that salience, which is in the definition.

38:01.080 --> 38:08.920
How were those qualia interpreted? So when the hairs on my arm stood up, how did I see

38:08.920 --> 38:13.400
the hairs on my arm standing up? So obviously, you're going to receive the signal, but how

38:13.480 --> 38:19.320
do you interpret it and then turn that signal into action? These are questions that haven't

38:19.320 --> 38:26.840
really been answered yet in this particular area. And then this last one, which I think,

38:28.120 --> 38:31.480
it looks like an afterthought because it's one sentence, but it's not one sentence,

38:31.480 --> 38:36.680
it's actually really important. How did the officer justify this hunch in later court proceedings?

38:36.680 --> 38:42.440
And I have written hundreds, probably thousands of police statements over the years. And I know

38:42.440 --> 38:48.440
that reading back those statements, they will read very rationally. They will read super rationally.

38:48.440 --> 38:55.240
So my ability to rationalize my decision making, post decision making is way better than my ability

38:55.240 --> 39:02.600
to interpret a hunch rationally. And there's a big disconnect there. So you end up with a lot of

39:02.600 --> 39:06.760
obviously hindsight bias. If you stopped a car and you found some heroin, well, you stopped the

39:06.760 --> 39:10.520
car because you think that there was drugs on the car. But as mentioned earlier, in the

39:11.160 --> 39:17.560
article, sometimes that hunch is nonspecific. It's raised through experience. That's

39:18.600 --> 39:24.600
very, very different, really different. And I don't think that officers have got the skills

39:24.600 --> 39:29.960
to interpret the hunches well enough to make well-reasoned decisions. I think that they rely

39:29.960 --> 39:35.960
upon intuition much more than they say they do. And I'm not, well, I know because I've been one

39:35.960 --> 39:40.120
and I've been around them. I know how these things work. So I just don't think that it's been

39:40.120 --> 39:48.360
researched well. And then as we get towards the end, we move into the, again, the theory

39:49.720 --> 39:54.920
support from that figure. And we posit a series of areas for future research.

39:56.360 --> 40:00.520
So we've got here longitudinal study on hunch development. So this is tracking the development

40:00.520 --> 40:04.840
of hunches in police officers as their career develops. I think this is super interesting

40:04.840 --> 40:09.480
because when I talked about going up to that door in the domestic and Jamie not feeling

40:09.560 --> 40:15.640
anything and me having the most salient feeling I've ever had, there's something going on there.

40:17.000 --> 40:23.800
So when does that start to happen? When do police intuitions become so noticeable and

40:23.800 --> 40:28.680
powerful that people can see them and be able to act upon them or be able to notice them and

40:28.680 --> 40:34.520
suppress them? Because even that is an interesting area. So if you are getting a hunch and you think

40:34.520 --> 40:40.520
that hunch may be informed through past discriminations, then surely you need to be able to suppress

40:40.520 --> 40:47.160
it. You shouldn't be acting upon it. So if you think, for instance, that there's an element

40:47.160 --> 40:52.840
of discrimination in stopping a vehicle, you need to be able to notice that and stop that before it

40:52.840 --> 40:58.040
happens. And it could be unbidden. And again, this is in the definition. So you haven't invited the

40:58.040 --> 41:03.080
hunch. It just comes, but you may know that there's not enough there for you to make that stop.

41:03.560 --> 41:08.200
There's not enough evidence. So something's going on and you need to be able to see that and stop

41:08.200 --> 41:12.920
that happening. Comparative analysis with a little profession. So this is looking at the

41:12.920 --> 41:17.560
generation of hunches, for instance, in the medical environment, neurobiological correlates.

41:17.560 --> 41:22.680
So this was to look at neurobiological processes associated with hunch formation,

41:22.680 --> 41:27.080
the use of brain and body imaging techniques. This is probably way above my pay grade,

41:27.080 --> 41:31.800
but it will be super useful. And there is some precedent for it in very, very primitive studies

41:31.800 --> 41:37.400
in the 70s and 80s that look at things like heart rate and blood pressure over the tour of

41:37.400 --> 41:44.680
duty of a police officer. But it'd be brilliant to see that advance. Much more advanced wearables,

41:44.680 --> 41:49.160
even looking at good scanning equipment, how are these hunches generated? It might even be one

41:49.160 --> 41:54.840
for the future, but we thought we'd discuss it. The impact of training on hunch accuracy,

41:54.840 --> 41:59.240
this is something that came from Professor Kempese. He was talking about training scars.

41:59.480 --> 42:04.760
Have you heard of training scars, Daniel? No. So training scars are where

42:06.040 --> 42:12.280
you constantly train in a particular way. Your grooves become very, very pronounced

42:12.280 --> 42:17.080
in the way that you approach similar incidents because you train so much. And then when an

42:17.080 --> 42:22.680
incident presents itself, your brain kicks you into those grooves, even though the grooves may

42:22.680 --> 42:29.640
be inappropriate. So they can lead to, so for instance, taking a shot because that's a shot

42:29.640 --> 42:36.440
you would have taken in training, despite the fact that that shot was non-justified. Or another one

42:36.440 --> 42:42.280
where there's not enough threat in the training scenarios. So because of that, you act in a much

42:42.280 --> 42:48.200
more slow and considered way when you need to act much more quickly. Both of those will be

42:48.200 --> 42:55.800
considered training scars. And again, so overtraining may suppress good hunch

42:55.800 --> 43:00.920
intuition or development. That's an idea. I'm not saying it's there, it's just an idea.

43:02.360 --> 43:07.640
So diversity, and we'll discuss this quite a bit today. Insighting to potentially gendered

43:07.640 --> 43:13.160
hunches. I mean, I'm super interested in that. Look, this plays out. When you look at the stats

43:13.160 --> 43:18.920
of things like stopping vehicles, it is different. It's different from a gender basis. There's

43:18.920 --> 43:25.720
something going on. No one's looking at it. I think this needs looking at. Operationalization

43:25.720 --> 43:33.960
of hunches in policing. So when, and I'm currently planning a study that looks at this now, so using

43:33.960 --> 43:37.560
both qualitative and quantitative methods, investigating the factors that contribute to

43:37.560 --> 43:42.360
the activation and follow through of hunches. But to do that, you have to be aware that a

43:42.360 --> 43:47.560
hunch is happening. And that's a that's the one of the things that we're trying to get our heads

43:47.560 --> 43:53.320
around like, how do we, how do we make officers aware enough that intuition is kicking in? And

43:53.320 --> 43:58.440
then when that intuition is kicking in, how do we help them describe it and also help describe

43:58.440 --> 44:03.160
their decision making off the back of it? Because I think, again, if we go back to that pragmatism

44:03.160 --> 44:07.160
side, I think the hunch kicks in the police officer makes the decision, but there's very

44:07.160 --> 44:12.120
little rational consideration of the connection between the hunch and the action. So that's

44:12.120 --> 44:17.080
something that I think we can look at. Comparative analysis of policing models, and I'll give you

44:17.080 --> 44:23.160
a really quick and dirty example of this. So in the US, obviously, it's a coercive policing model.

44:23.160 --> 44:28.680
In the UK, it's a consensual policing model. Both of those will change the way that hunches

44:28.680 --> 44:35.960
are generated. They will. So have you heard of the touching the tail light on police vehicles? So

44:36.680 --> 44:44.360
in the US, when a cop touches, stops a car, as the police officer walks towards the car to speak

44:44.360 --> 44:50.200
to the driver, they touch the tail light. Now, there's lots of reasons for this. The first is that

44:50.200 --> 44:55.080
you leave your fingerprint and DNA on the tail light. Okay. But if you think about what that's

44:55.080 --> 45:00.200
doing in the officer's brain, the immediate consideration when he gets out of that car is,

45:00.200 --> 45:06.040
I could die. And I need to leave evidence on this vehicle in front of me. Now,

45:06.760 --> 45:10.280
I have stopped thousands of vehicles in my police career, and I have never once thought that.

45:11.240 --> 45:17.400
And because I've never once thought it, I can hypothesize that the generation of hunches will

45:17.400 --> 45:24.680
be way different in terms of sensitivity to an American police officer's generation of hunches.

45:25.320 --> 45:30.440
Not least because the threat is so mitigated in the UK, the chances of me coming up against

45:30.440 --> 45:35.720
firearm is almost nil. I have never seen a gun. I've never fired one till about six months ago.

45:36.360 --> 45:41.080
So like 18 years of service, and I've never carried and I've never seen a gun in a real life

45:41.080 --> 45:45.720
police environment, that's going to change the way that I police. And I do think that there'll be a

45:45.720 --> 45:50.840
different operationalization of hunches as a result. And that's something that will be a fascinating

45:50.840 --> 45:58.760
study. And then this one here, this impact of technological support, how does the use of technology

46:00.200 --> 46:04.600
change hunch development? So for instance, and this is going to sound really weird, but

46:04.600 --> 46:10.120
let's just say a police officer is trained to record when a hunch is received. And it could

46:10.120 --> 46:17.400
be as simple as a tap on the wrist for a wearable or something similar. And that could then help

46:17.480 --> 46:22.360
us correlate the types of incidents that police officers are at when they receive hunches. They

46:22.360 --> 46:26.680
don't have to explain them. It's just like, where are you most likely to get them? Where

46:26.680 --> 46:31.960
does your intuition manifest? And then we could look backwards at how it manifested and what it

46:31.960 --> 46:37.560
did. And then the last one, which is the public perception and trust. Possible to investigate

46:37.560 --> 46:43.160
how public perception and trust in law enforcement are influenced by officers reliance on hunches.

46:43.160 --> 46:48.200
So I'll give you a quick example of this. If you rely on hunches to do stop searches,

46:49.080 --> 46:54.680
and that means that you do more stop searches, that may affect community trust within that

46:55.880 --> 47:00.200
that particular community where you conduct in the stop searches, that then becomes reciprocal.

47:00.840 --> 47:05.960
So you rely on intuition to do stop searches rather than rational thought. That leads to a

47:05.960 --> 47:11.320
rise in stop searches, leads to a rise in arrests, and also probably a rise in much more like

47:12.280 --> 47:17.480
a friction based interactions with members of the public. Long term, that's going to lead to a

47:17.480 --> 47:24.920
breakdown in relationships and possibly issues with legitimacy. So how the public perceive

47:26.920 --> 47:33.000
the legitimacy of police actions. So that's just an example of where we could go on the big scale.

47:33.000 --> 47:38.680
This last one's a very macro, like kind of level study. And some of these up here are much more

47:38.760 --> 47:44.040
personally based. And Daniel, I think that's about it.

47:47.480 --> 47:54.120
Thank you. Thanks for overviewing it. I have some questions and there's some great

47:54.120 --> 47:57.320
questions in the live chat. So. Okay, that sounds good.

48:00.120 --> 48:06.040
Wow. Many places to jump in. There's the fundamental tension with the

48:06.600 --> 48:17.000
possibly arbitrary or hard to explain yet intuitive and honed nature of the hunch.

48:18.200 --> 48:27.400
And about how the hunch has such a rich before, during, and after. There's kind of, there must

48:27.400 --> 48:34.040
be something like hearing the code called on the radio. Yeah. And that setting a stage like,

48:34.040 --> 48:40.600
I'm going to a comedy, I'm going to a horror movie, or it's this code and that's all that is

48:40.600 --> 48:45.880
being passed through the blanket is just what code it is. And that's equivalent to like saying,

48:45.880 --> 48:51.480
what is your prior? What do you prepare yourself for, given that it's just this number or that

48:51.480 --> 48:56.760
number? And what are the costs and the sensitivities to like false positives and false negatives?

48:58.600 --> 49:02.200
So there's a lot of stages to investigate, like looking forward to the hunch and then

49:02.200 --> 49:07.640
looking back on it, where certain kinds of rhetoric or certain kinds of thinking are

49:08.440 --> 49:13.960
privileged or supported by legal proceedings and saying something like, well,

49:15.160 --> 49:18.840
I just didn't think it was that way in the moment, could be the most honest statement,

49:18.840 --> 49:21.640
yet it might be seen as like almost malpractice.

49:24.600 --> 49:31.080
Okay. Awesome questions from the live chat. Yes, exactly right. Okay. All right. Here we go. I'll

49:31.160 --> 49:37.800
just read them basically in order they come in. All right. So Susan asks, does hunch lead to

49:37.800 --> 49:45.080
epistemic foraging or pragmatic foraging? So let's just unpack that in the expected free energy,

49:46.040 --> 49:53.800
decision making, functional, different policies are evaluated in terms of their epistemic value,

49:54.360 --> 49:59.880
like expected information gain and pragmatic value, which is aligning observations

50:00.680 --> 50:09.720
with your preferences. So how does that raising of the hunch then get pushed one way or another

50:10.520 --> 50:18.520
into seeking more information epistemically or directly moving to take pragmatic action?

50:19.880 --> 50:26.760
So I think that was a very nice way of summing up a lot of the discussion that where I talked

50:26.760 --> 50:32.840
about the lean towards pragmatism, the desire for control for a police officer when they first get

50:32.840 --> 50:43.320
there is like, it's almost primal. And I know that that's a big word to use. But they will, I think,

50:43.320 --> 50:51.560
tend to lean incredibly strongly into the pragmatic and then move into the epistemic.

50:52.200 --> 50:59.000
So, and if you think about this, this mirrors the court process, like if I turn up to an incident

50:59.640 --> 51:04.600
and there's threat within the incident, the first thing that I want to do is, and I know the word

51:04.600 --> 51:10.600
is awful because of the connotations it brings, but neutralise the threat. I want the threat gone,

51:11.160 --> 51:17.640
because while the threat is there, my intuition is going nuts. I mean, it overrides everything.

51:18.120 --> 51:23.320
I'll give you a very quick practical example. If I'm in an incident where I believe that the

51:23.320 --> 51:27.880
male party in domestic violence is going to assault me or assault the victim while I'm there,

51:29.480 --> 51:36.680
that my brain does not want to allow any epistemic foraging. No, there's a safety override and the

51:36.680 --> 51:42.040
safety override is essentially make sure that this male is not going to assault you or assault the

51:42.120 --> 51:47.800
other person before we start asking questions. And that safety override is often the thing that

51:47.800 --> 51:52.040
people will look at and say, and this is what I meant when I talked about the difference between

51:52.040 --> 51:58.520
jurisdictions. So, I would say that the safety override in the US is much more powerful than it

51:58.520 --> 52:03.720
is in the UK because of the threat that's there, because of the availability of firearms. So,

52:03.720 --> 52:10.120
you're probably going to find where there's more firearms, the link towards pragmatic foraging is

52:10.120 --> 52:16.200
way higher, way, way higher. And then once that's done, neutralized, whatever word you want to use,

52:16.760 --> 52:22.920
then that's when the longer form questions and the much more calm information gathering takes

52:22.920 --> 52:30.920
place. So, really good question. There's definitely a lean towards pragmatic over epistemic,

52:31.640 --> 52:37.960
but epistemic will happen and it just may come after the pragmatic. So, there could be a kind of

52:37.960 --> 52:46.120
hierarchy, a hierarchy if you like affordances because of the situation that presents. Does

52:46.120 --> 52:52.760
that make sense? Yeah, like to give a kind of a non-policing example, it's like you dropped an

52:52.760 --> 52:59.400
object on the floor. If it was very surely just a soft carpet, you might feel around blindly and

52:59.400 --> 53:05.480
epistemic foraging would have like a low risk. But if you strongly believed that there was like

53:05.480 --> 53:11.640
other sharp objects on the floor, you would be way more skeptical with just kind of reaching

53:11.640 --> 53:17.240
into dangerous locations. Daniel, can you answer my questions because that was way better than I

53:17.240 --> 53:29.800
just did. Okay, next one. We'll each give a shot. Susan asks, how are police trained to avoid group

53:29.800 --> 53:38.360
think i.e. not just follow the ones with improper force over motivations? So, you're talking about

53:38.360 --> 53:45.160
individual cognition in that moment, but yet in that dyad encounter, there was like a collective

53:45.160 --> 53:54.840
intelligence component and a difference in hunches. So, how does the group training and operating come

53:54.840 --> 54:03.480
into play? Yeah, this is really interesting because there's nothing about the way that your

54:03.480 --> 54:11.240
brain behaves under pressure in any of the police training. Nothing. So, and I suppose, and this is

54:11.240 --> 54:17.080
a massive criticism and I used to talk about this a lot because I was involved in the design of what's

54:17.080 --> 54:22.440
called the PQF in the UK, which is the Education Qualification Framework. And it was a very,

54:22.440 --> 54:28.600
very controversial project for me to be involved in, but it was about raising the initial level

54:28.600 --> 54:34.840
of education to a degree level, bachelor's level for police officers. And one of the major drives

54:34.840 --> 54:42.600
is obviously to blunt to some extent the lean towards pragmatism and offer some priors for

54:42.600 --> 54:48.520
the making of police decisions that are better than those based just in practice. But this is a move

54:48.520 --> 54:54.760
away from what you would call like a kind of master apprentice model, which is the, and it's

54:54.760 --> 55:00.840
experience based epistemic model now of police learning into something that's much more a priori,

55:00.840 --> 55:08.520
which is your more traditional, educative professionalized model. So, are they taught to

55:08.520 --> 55:12.520
ignore group thing? I'd probably say, well, there was no discussion of group things during my training,

55:12.520 --> 55:16.680
but I have to think back, I mean, my training was 23, 24 years ago, and I'm sure that things have

55:16.680 --> 55:26.520
progressed. Will it be good informed, solidly evident stuff? Probably not. And I think in some

55:26.520 --> 55:30.920
cases, I think there may be some really good academics who will be out there working with

55:30.920 --> 55:35.880
particular forces, and they will be given this sort of training. But I think it's a more general

55:35.880 --> 55:40.760
approach. I don't think it's there. And I think it's a massive gap. So really good question.

55:41.720 --> 55:54.120
All right. Yeah, very interesting. It's a team sport, team art slash science. And so,

55:55.080 --> 56:02.760
it has to be at least considered how do officers share their hunches? They just raise their hand

56:02.760 --> 56:07.800
and say, I have a hunch. But that might be throwing a wrench into things in the moment.

56:08.760 --> 56:17.480
So, how do the right communication surface, and then you have the radio, and you have the

56:17.480 --> 56:23.160
local communication, you have these different avenues of message passing, but not all messages

56:23.800 --> 56:30.680
lead to resolution of the situation. So, Daniel, that's a really good comment. And we're just

56:30.680 --> 56:35.400
submitted a paper, which is on the use of decision making models in detective world.

56:36.040 --> 56:41.560
And we were talking about this, like, I was only on a murder inquiry for a year of my service. So,

56:43.160 --> 56:47.960
but I saw the way that the murder inquiries worked. And it is way more rational. And they

56:47.960 --> 56:53.320
invite hunches. So, like, you're seeing your investigating officers will say, look, have any

56:53.320 --> 56:58.680
of you got any feelings about this? Please try and explain them, you know, how or the other one

56:58.680 --> 57:02.280
where you just run an interview with one of the suspects. And one of the first questions that

57:02.280 --> 57:07.560
would come out isn't what did the suspect say? It's, what do you think? How did it make you feel?

57:08.120 --> 57:14.440
You know, so there's a real space within the detective world for the discussion and sharing

57:14.440 --> 57:22.360
of hunches. Now, if I pick that same instance up and you drop it into uniform, because it's so

57:22.360 --> 57:28.120
temporarily enforced, that you won't get chance a lot of the time to share your hunches. Like,

57:28.120 --> 57:33.240
so if I have a bad feeling about somebody at an incident, and this is that lean towards

57:33.240 --> 57:38.840
pragmatism again, I will want to make sure that I'm safe before I go anywhere. I won't share

57:38.840 --> 57:44.760
with the officer next to me, I have a bad feeling about that person. I want to take pragmatic action

57:44.760 --> 57:49.480
to go and try and deal with that bad feeling. So again, this leans back into that other question

57:49.480 --> 57:54.520
that we've just discussed. I would say that so the sharing of hunches and the passing of messages

57:54.600 --> 58:03.160
probably much more available within the long decision making processes within detective work

58:03.160 --> 58:09.320
and very poor within the incredibly short, temporarily influenced decision making of

58:09.320 --> 58:17.400
uniform. Does that make sense? Yeah, it also makes me think about active inference and

58:17.400 --> 58:23.640
statistics are providing like a science of uncertainty and decision making amidst uncertainty.

58:23.720 --> 58:31.880
And yet in many different domains, ranging from policing to law, science, there's kind of

58:32.760 --> 58:39.400
bespoke ways of dealing with uncertainties. And different settings even within the given

58:39.400 --> 58:44.680
field like different cases are going to have different treatments of uncertainties. And so

58:45.640 --> 58:54.440
there's now this dance or a fusion to bring together those different treatments of uncertainty.

58:55.960 --> 59:02.280
I'm really curious how you see active inference and extended cognition in light of

59:03.720 --> 59:08.760
even though I'm not very familiar with the details, the growth of policing technologies

59:08.840 --> 59:16.680
and surveillance technologies and the different paths that a given officer or department might have

59:16.680 --> 59:23.480
in front of them in terms of how they incorporate technology into their whole apparatus.

59:25.080 --> 59:28.040
So there's definitely going to be a really, really big shift here.

59:29.480 --> 59:35.640
So when I left two or three years ago, there were discussions three years ago about things like

59:35.720 --> 59:45.480
the integration of active heads up displays. Okay, so when I'm at an incident, if I've got facial

59:45.480 --> 59:51.320
recognition, and it's running in the background, and it's passing me information that I don't have

59:51.320 --> 59:58.520
and didn't have, how will that affect my decision making? And that is, and I'm going to be really

59:58.520 --> 01:00:07.320
honest, really scary, because really scary and really beneficial. So I'll give you a quick example.

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:11.160
I turned up at an incident again, I'm going to keep using the domestic incident because it's

01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:16.040
simple and we as police officers go to them all the time. Okay, so it's a, and I keep calling

01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:19.800
myself a police officer. I'm not a police officer anymore, I'm full-time academic, but you know,

01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:27.320
one time. So anyway, if I turn up at an incident and I have a set of glasses and my body cam on,

01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:31.640
my body cams running at all times. So I know that there's some element of surveillance of my

01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:36.600
behavior. And I know that whenever you look back at this incident, my decision making is going to be

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:44.280
scrutinized. Okay, so when it goes into the court system, my behavior will definitely be on show.

01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:48.440
And I know that as a result, obviously, I have to behave within the rules and the bounds and all

01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:53.880
that sort of thing. Now, there's a propensity, and I'm sure you know this, of police officers to do

01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:59.160
what's called informal working practices, where they essentially step outside the strict rules and

01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:06.680
laws and they try and take pragmatic decisions. So an example might be if I stop somebody speeding,

01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:10.920
I might want to give them a warning, I might not want to give them a ticket. But speeding is

01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:15.320
technically a strict liability offense, so I should have to give them a ticket. And instead,

01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:20.760
I operate and I use discretion, I decide not to do it, I give words of advice and that person drives

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:27.240
off. Okay. With things like your heads up display, if I'm walking towards that car, and I'm wearing

01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:34.680
glasses that is giving me full history, full driving history, including infraction, speeding,

01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:39.720
tickets, et cetera, just by looking at the number plate. And then when I get up to that

01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:44.440
driver's side window and the window comes down and my facial recognition tells me that this

01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:50.520
person has got previous for X, Y, and Z, a soul, et cetera. Is that going to change my decision

01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:57.640
making 100% because what has the police officer got to deal with now? They have what's in front of

01:01:57.640 --> 01:02:04.600
them. And then they do that epistemic foraging. The extended cognition that would come from

01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:12.600
lifetime information during decision making is crazy. And I'll tell you right now, we'll be doing

01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:19.480
it before we understand whether it is a good thing to do or not. Because that's what police do,

01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:24.040
they will jump in probably. In fact, I'd be surprised if people weren't testing this stuff now.

01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:32.120
And the other thing I think, I mean, I went straight to wearable stuff there, but there's

01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:37.400
other stuff that might help. So if I'm thinking from an interceptive perspective, there's a really

01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:45.240
good study called Emotional Survival for Law Enforcement Officers. It was a police psychologist

01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:53.160
that wrote it. And he put heart rate monitors on police officers. And he showed that when you go

01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:57.000
into what's called a Code 1 incident in the UK, which is an emergency incident, the blue lights

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.840
are on, you know, like you were talking about the code, the pattern of the information and the

01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:06.520
bodily reactions to it. If I'm going to an emergency incident, when I first start, you're

01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:11.800
incredibly aware, interceptively, of what's going on. So you can feel your heart, your

01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:21.000
breath quickens, your periphery narrows, all of the normal stress reactions kick in.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:24.760
Okay. Because you know that when you land there, there's probably going to be conflict of some

01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:28.920
sort and you're going to have to deal with it. Now, what the study showed was that

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:35.240
very, very experienced police officers, so we're talking like 15 years, 20 years plus,

01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:42.440
when they were going to the emergency incidents, they would say that those bodily reactions were

01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:50.760
not happening. But the monitors would say that they were. And this is super interesting.

01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:57.080
Because it may mean, you could say that the police officer has got more control over their

01:03:57.080 --> 01:04:03.400
interception, or you could say the exact opposite. So they have dulled their interception over time

01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:10.280
through exposure, continued exposure. And we don't know about the effects on hunches,

01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:16.040
or the effects on general decision making in those different lengths of service, if you like.

01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:21.480
Now, if we go back to the extended stuff, imagine having a wearable that tells you this

01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:28.360
lifetime. That would be super interesting. Like it, I mean, again, I'm like, you know,

01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:32.440
maybe five years in the future here, but we're not a million miles away. There are well-being

01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:36.040
wearables that are ongoing now. I don't think they're being used for this purpose.

01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:41.880
Could they change decision making? Definitely. In good and bad ways, hey,

01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:47.320
I know this just needs a lot more research, this bit that you're discussing, loads more research.

01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:52.440
It just needs some proper, proper good looking at, because it could be immensely beneficial.

01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:55.320
I can just see a million ways where it could also be quite damaging.

01:04:55.880 --> 01:05:06.040
Wow. Yeah, the awareness of the hunch. And then there's one setting where the hunch is not

01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:13.000
aroused, which may be like a burnout situation. Yeah, exactly. And then yet also on the other

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:20.040
side of, let's just say, like a stage performer, they still might get the physiological arousal,

01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:25.720
but they actually expect it. And so they don't attend to it because this whole thing with

01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:32.200
active is not paying attention to what we expect. And so they have a deeper experience layer that

01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:38.760
contextualized the hunch. And yet that might obscure that hunch from being communicated,

01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:47.240
like to a younger colleague, and yet communicated where and how the experienced professor or

01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:57.320
lawyer or officer feels in a situation is that ineffable experience transfer. And then I totally

01:05:57.320 --> 01:06:06.360
see these different paths with the wearables, one path where the boots on the ground are just

01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:11.160
reduced to an actuator in a decision making system that they're not even a part of.

01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:14.840
Because it tells them, here's what you want to do to this car.

01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:23.320
Don't epistemically forage, just fulfill what the order is. Exactly. And then there's the

01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:29.240
epistemic engagement mode. And we can imagine like the family doctor asking somebody questions

01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:35.320
rather than like looking at their digital health record. And there's kind of, there's a charming

01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:43.240
and an open-endedness to that. And yet in high reliability situations, people are going to be

01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:50.040
put into which lane are we going to take this doctor's office? Are we going to use digital

01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:56.840
health records? Or are we going to have slower, potentially noisier encounters just because

01:06:56.840 --> 01:07:04.520
people self-report that they like that more than the other way? Yes. Yeah. And just as you got me

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:10.040
thinking that there's some really good studies that look at things like cancer diagnosis. And so

01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:14.440
you know, somebody comes in with a bad ankle and a doctor says, yeah, you need to go for this test

01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:19.720
and this test and this test. And they're unable to rationalize that. It's the same thing, but there's

01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:25.720
a much more. So if you look at a doctor's purpose, they're still going to be pragmatically based.

01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:30.920
They're going to be trying to solve whatever problem is facing them. But their relevance

01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:35.080
realization has got so skilled over the years. And this is some of the stuff that you were just

01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:40.600
talking about there, where there's lots of signals coming in that are just very, very

01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:45.880
efficiently dealt with subconsciously. And it may be about making that person aware of what

01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:49.800
that subconscious is doing in order to properly understand it. And this is what I was talking

01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:55.960
about with the hunch generation stuff. Because police officers don't often, they don't interrogate

01:07:56.600 --> 01:08:01.320
the journey that led them to make the decision, they make the decision and then they rationalize

01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:08.440
it backwards. I think there's so much we could do here. There's so much potential because, and again,

01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:12.680
this is for improved decision making. This isn't like, so we're looking at improved outcomes here.

01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:16.360
We want to make policing better. How do we make it better? Well, I would say that increasing

01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:21.800
self-awareness about decision making is absolutely fundamental. You can't go anywhere. This is just

01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:30.360
like perfect, you know, and the whole framework of active inference and the Bayesian brain,

01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:35.960
it just lends itself to this so well, way better than the other theories that I'd explored. And

01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:41.400
some of which are in the article, like, you know, like the schema, the script, et cetera. But I

01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:46.600
love Bramsted's work on niche construction in it. That's something I think that I would like to look

01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:50.520
at a little bit more, I think, because as time goes on, sorry, my brain just went there towards

01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:56.200
the end. I don't know why. Is there anything else on your question wise? Have we got some more?

01:08:56.200 --> 01:09:00.280
Yeah. Yeah. Okay, let's keep going with questions. Jeff asks,

01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:15.720
I don't know the book, but what do you think of the general question?

01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:25.000
I don't, but I have. So I work in a security and defense academy. So I'm surrounded by

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:29.560
military scholars. That's a really good question. And I will go and ask it for Jeff.

01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:34.680
Cool. Okay. Dave asks,

01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:49.320
Oh,

01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:06.200
that's a really good question. And I have to be honest, I mean, I've read some stuff

01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:11.400
on hallucinations, and I've listened to podcasts from machine learning street talk as well as some

01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:17.560
good discussions around it. I mean, they're anomalies, aren't they? But

01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:25.000
and I suppose you're going to have a set of rules within the LLM that still allows them to be

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:29.480
displayed in the same way that you're going to have a set of rules within the body that allows

01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:37.960
the hunches to come to the fore. I don't know is the answer to that. And I know that we don't

01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:43.640
properly understand hallucinations yet. But I would, I mean, obviously, we've got no consciousness

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:49.800
in in the deep learning machines point of contention, but most people would say there's no

01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:57.400
consciousness there. Whereas the hunch, the hunch is ability to rise through the consciousness.

01:10:57.400 --> 01:11:03.000
So the quality of the hunch is the bit that makes it salient. And I think that that salience

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:10.200
will be lacking in any element of LLM deep learning based work, if that makes sense. Does

01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:18.440
that make sense, Daniel? Yeah, I think another complimentary way that I thought of that question

01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:26.200
is the hallucinations, let's just say in image output, you say represents this, and it makes a

01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:32.440
full resolution image that is non factually based. And so people sometimes refer to it as a hallucination.

01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:42.440
So whereas the outputs of that are in terms of observations that are just factually ungrounded,

01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:52.200
the hunch, it's not like it's a, it's not a visual phenomena. It's not like there's a visual,

01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:59.720
a new visual overlay or a sensory prediction. It's something slower that is kind of like

01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:07.320
an upwelling of something that is salient, because as you pointed to, it's slower, it's

01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:16.360
interceptive, it's affective. It's not modifying like what we see, smell here in the way where

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:22.440
when people talk about hallucinations as outputs of machine learning models, they're usually

01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:25.880
talking about that. I think you might do that though, Daniel. That sounds really weird, but

01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:33.560
I think it may to some extent do that. So and I'm just thinking about how that might be the case.

01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:42.040
So if I'm at an incident, I'll give you another very quick example. So we went to conduct a

01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:45.960
mandatory section in which is a horrible incident and I hate them, but it's essentially taking

01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:52.440
somebody into full-time mental health care. He was a serious schizophrenic with, he was a danger

01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:59.000
to others. And we went to basically take him into custody so that he could go to the hospital

01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:03.960
because he wasn't, he wasn't refusing to take his medication or short for his appointments,

01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:09.320
and it was carrying the community, et cetera, and he had to attack somebody. And I was in that room

01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:17.240
for probably one minute and I was telling the doctors to get out because I knew what was coming.

01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:25.160
And if somebody had, and this is what you say, well, it changes the way that you see,

01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:31.640
well, it does because it changes your relevance realisation is that as the intuition kicks in

01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:37.160
and becomes stronger, then your focus changes visually. So you're going to be filtering out

01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:41.880
much more of the side if you like and focusing in on what would be considered the threat,

01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:47.480
whatever the threat may be. And in this case, I mean, he was holding a knife down the side of

01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:52.840
a sofa and he was about to attack us. And for some reason, something about that incident, again,

01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:59.720
highly salient feeling, it then changed the way that I saw, it changed the way that I interacted,

01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:07.000
communicated, changed the way that I dealt with my externals, and I suppose you could call them

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:11.880
variables. So I wanted all the people out of the way, because that would then give me greater,

01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:18.600
that would give me less to think about when the conflict actually happened. So I would probably

01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:25.800
say, there's a little, there's a parallel there, I think that it can affect the senses. And I imagine

01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:30.920
no, I quite like it. It's an interesting thing to think about.

01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:39.080
I saw in the paper, you cited the quantum reference frames and Chris Fields' work,

01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:43.400
so that just makes me think walking down a street, one reference frame is just like,

01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:49.320
oh, there's people milling about. And then another reference frame, whether this is paranoid or not,

01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:55.560
is like, their information to circle me, or somebody is shaking a little bit in their hand,

01:14:55.560 --> 01:15:00.600
and it's like, oh, maybe they have essential tremor. Maybe they're nervous. Maybe they're

01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:07.400
about to do this. And so that doesn't change the, the photons hitting the retina.

01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:13.000
That's right. It changes our framing. And that is what is actionable.

01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:24.040
And a more cognitively informed law and legal system could have a more

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:33.080
agreed. Yes, you're right. Yes, you're exactly right. Yeah. Yes. Very good. I told you, you're

01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:39.960
way better at this, Daniel. You wrap up my words and it just comes out in a much simpler way. Very

01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:49.800
good. Let's, we're cruising together. Well, where are you going to go in your continuing directions

01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:55.720
here? Like, what are you going to do with this now that you have the frontier's paper?

01:15:56.760 --> 01:16:01.320
Okay, so there's a couple of things that I want to do. I want to

01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:14.360
test whether current decision making models in policing that are used widely in many different

01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:23.960
countries are useful for the processing and understanding of police hunches,

01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:29.400
because I think that they are accountability models and not decision making models. So that's

01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:35.960
something that I want to look at. But I suppose the more relevant study will be research in the

01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:44.440
quality of the hunch. So within different settings, especially within uniform, I'm very

01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:50.120
interested in it because of its, its contact with legitimacy as a whole, like how police

01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:58.760
are perceived. I want to know how uniformed officers receive, understand, process, and then act upon

01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:06.680
hunches. And the study that I have in mind is, this is going to sound really weird.

01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:13.560
I want to do like a kind of personalized dictophone, like a narrative account. So essentially,

01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:19.480
when a police officer in any corner of the world makes a decision on the basis of a hunch,

01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:26.760
that is then narrated into this kind of like repository. And we use that repository as a

01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:34.760
qualitative evidence base to research how the hunch is processing and then acted upon.

01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:42.760
That's what I'm thinking. So I'm currently in the process of getting funding. And I'm hoping that

01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:47.640
I can secure it. And if I can, I'd like to run it as a, this is going to sound really strange,

01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:54.200
but a voluntary, worldwide study. So I don't care where you're a police officer. I want you to take

01:17:54.200 --> 01:18:03.560
part. And we look at how you are receiving on a daily basis, your minor hunches from I want to

01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:09.480
stop that car through to those like kind of heart hitting your stomach, pile or reaction,

01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:13.960
high threat hunches that totally change the way that you see the incident in front of you.

01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:21.560
So that's the, that's the next step, I think. That makes me think of Aeroid, which is a repository

01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:29.880
of alternate states of consciousness, mostly based upon substances. So yeah, that's another,

01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:38.360
but it's a voluntary self-report. And that sounds very cool and voluntary.

01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:44.840
I'm hoping, I'm hoping that's the plan. But I'm hoping that once I get the funding,

01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:49.560
that that will be a green light. And obviously in the meantime, I mean, it's been so cool talking

01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:56.040
to you, Daniel. And I know that the community is quite tight in around the Active Infants Institute.

01:18:56.760 --> 01:19:01.320
So if anybody has been listening or if anybody listens to this in the meantime, if you've got

01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:07.240
any cool ideas or you want to ask me any questions, but just email me. I love to talk about this stuff

01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:10.920
in general. And the discussion, I know that we mentioned it right at the beginning, but even

01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:15.160
the discussion where we talked about the law, I've got, I've got a theory that I've spoken to a

01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:21.080
professor about. I'll just throw this out there just to finish off. I think that people may call the

01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:31.320
police when the surprising bounds are breached. And they want the police to be an agent of return.

01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:36.520
So essentially, the police become an agent of our stasis to return to home your stasis for

01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:43.160
that person. Now, what that gives us, and it's something that we don't have, is a general theory

01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:50.200
of police contact. And it allows us to see how different communities may call the police based

01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:56.040
on their different surprising bounds. So for instance, in high chaos communities, their

01:19:56.040 --> 01:20:02.600
sensitivity to surprise is going to be much higher than those that are in, sorry, much lower than

01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:10.920
those that are in very, very structured gated communities, for instance. And this, this could

01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:16.360
lead us to some really interesting research. But it's something that is very much in the

01:20:16.360 --> 01:20:21.160
background of my brain and something that I'm, I'm thinking about a lot, reading about a lot,

01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:29.960
and hoping that maybe over time, I can start to develop it. Awesome. Thank you, Gareth, for

01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:37.000
connecting these critical areas and bringing active in. And it's just exciting to hear where it's

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:41.480
going. Oh, thank you, Daniel. Thank you for your time. And thank you to everyone who's actually

01:20:41.480 --> 01:20:46.120
managed to listen to me for, to drone along for this long piece. It's been a pleasure to have you.

01:20:46.120 --> 01:20:51.240
Oh, there's great comments in the live chat. So thank you. Talk to you next time. Okay. Thank you

01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:52.440
very much. Bye bye.
