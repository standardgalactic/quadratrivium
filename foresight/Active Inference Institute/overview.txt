============================
Checking Active Inference Institute/ActInf GuestStream #015.1： Bobby Azarian, Universal Bayesianism： A New Kind of Theory of Everything.txt
1. **Evolutionary Arms Race**: The concept of an evolutionary arms race can exist within a single species, not just between different species. This was acknowledged by Dr. Azarian and relates to the idea of a red queen phenomenon where organisms must continually adapt to each other to survive, leading to increased complexity.

2. **Game Theory in Biology**: John Maynard Smith applied game theory to biological evolution, showing that there is a competitive aspect to evolution similar to game theory scenarios. This competition can lead to complexity within and between species.

3. **Human Complexity**: Humans are considered the most complex species on Earth, and our biological intelligence may have limits due to factors like skull size and other biological constraints. However, humans can transcend these limits through technology, which is an extension of biology. The concept of the extended phenotype by Richard Dawkins explains how a creature's actions can affect its environment, thus extending its phenotype.

4. **Technological Integration**: Technology can be seen as part of our biological and ecological existence, not separate from it. The 'extended mind hypothesis' by philosopher David Chalmers suggests that tools like phones are an extension of our cognitive processes, raising questions about privacy and identity in the digital age.

5. **Future Discussions**: For further discussions on free-won agency, it would be beneficial to include insights from experts like Kevin McCormick or Eric Baas, who specialize in top-down causation and emergent phenomena.

6. **Feedback and Engagement**: Dr. Daniel Kaufman thanks the viewers, Marco, and anyone else who participated in the discussion for their questions and input. He appreciates the engagement and encourages revisiting the session for those who might have missed some details or want to delve deeper into the topics discussed.

7. **Legal Status of Substances**: A brief mention was made about the legal status of substances like delta-8 THC, with a nod to Micro's comment regarding water and its properties as it relates to hydration and legality.

In summary, the discussion covered the intersection of evolutionary biology, game theory, human complexity, technology as an extension of biology, and the potential for future discussions on agency and causation with experts in the field. There was also a shout-out to Marco and other viewers for their participation and questions. The session highlighted the importance of integrating insights from various fields to understand complex phenomena like consciousness, intelligence, and human evolution.

Checking Active Inference Institute/ActInf GuestStream 041.1 ~ ＂A conversation on Chomsky & Large Language Models＂ ~ Murphy & Piantadosi.txt
1. **Innate Syntax vs. Learned Categories**: The discussion touched upon whether syntactic categories are innate or learned. While some theories suggest that certain linguistic computations are innate, there is debate and ongoing research in this area.

2. **Compositionality and Analogical Reasoning**: Large language models (LLMs) like GPT have been shown to possess grammatical and semantic knowledge beyond just identifying part of speech categories. An example given was how LLMs handle compositionality and analogical reasoning, with the former sometimes leading to errors as seen in a BBC news article compression task. Analogical reasoning was also demonstrated when an LLM was asked to compare Jesus Christ with the Nokia 9910, showing some understanding of analogies but also producing nonsensical results at times.

3. **Existence Proof of Language Structure**: LLMs serve as existence proofs that computers can learn aspects of language structure, which includes more than just part of speech categories. They have a broad range of linguistic capabilities, including translation, semantic understanding, and grammatical synthesis.

4. **Implicit Priors vs. Animal Instinct**: The conversation explored the balance between implicit priors (pre-existing knowledge or biases) in LLMs versus the instinctual behaviors seen in animals. The question arose as to whether LLMs' capabilities are a result of training alone or if they also "discover" concepts inherently.

5. **Future Collaboration**: The hosts, Elliott and Stephen, expressed their appreciation for the discussion and mentioned that they hope to continue this conversation with more participants and deeper dives into topics related to language models and cognitive science in future streams.

The session ended with a commitment to further review each other's work and to come together again for an event or discussion, potentially referencing "41.2," which could be a specific talk, workshop, or meeting. The hosts thanked their audience and fellow panelists for the engaging and thought-provoking conversation.

Checking Active Inference Institute/ActInf GuestStream 051.1 ~ Tommaso Salvatori ＂Causal Inference via Predictive Coding＂.txt
1. Predictive coding (PC) is a theory of brain function which suggests that perception and action are inferred from sensory input by minimizing the difference between predictions (top-down) and predictions (bottom-up). It's a framework for understanding how the brain generates coherent perceptions from sensory inputs.

2. PC can be understood as a theory of causal inference, where the brain infers causes from effects and updates beliefs accordingly. This involves both generative and discriminative processes.

3. There are two main types of predictive coding: Bayesian predictive coding (BPC) and minimal surprise predictive coding (MSPC). BPC is more mathematically rigorous but harder to implement, while MSPC is easier to implement but less rigorous.

4. PC can be extended to handle dynamic data by using models like the Kalman filter, which allows for temporal causal modeling and can incorporate concepts like Granger causality.

5. The causal inference framework developed by Judea Pearl can be integrated with PC to improve its ability to handle complex data and perform interventions, leading to more robust models of perception and action.

6. Actions within the predictive coding framework can be understood as attention, the outputs of nodes, or expectations about action influenced by perception.

7. In active inference, decisions are made based on the most likely course of action according to Bayesian mechanics, which is a natural extension of the PC framework.

8. The application of predictive coding to solve practical problems has not been extensively explored, but there are promising approaches by researchers like Alexander Orobbie.

9. Thomas and Daniel expressed enthusiasm for future work on integrating predictive coding with action and causal inference, potentially leading to more sophisticated models that could be applied to real-world problems.

10. Both Thomas and Daniel appreciated the opportunity to discuss these topics and expressed a willingness to return for further discussions in the future.

6. The group agreed to continue the discussion at 16 UTC on July 29th, with a focus on exploring the link between brain waves and geometry, as well as testing the theory's predictions about spatial waves and belief updating.

Checking Active Inference Institute/ActInf GuestStream 083.1 ~ ＂Embodied intelligence＂, Joshua Bongard.txt
 Josh Bongard, a professor at the University of Vermont and co-founder of Lobster Gradients, discusses the intersection of biology, cognitive science, and robotics. He emphasizes that cognition is not just an emergent property of complex systems but is fundamentally embodied and enacted through interaction with the environment. This perspective has influenced his work on metamaterials, where he realized that action and cognition are not separate but one and the same.

Josh encourages those interested in this field to dive in, as resources for starting with coding embodied AI are more accessible than ever, even through virtual environments. He suggests that there are alternative paths to the current dominant approaches in AI, which rely heavily on large datasets and computational power. He encourages innovation and thinking differently to explore new ways of creating intelligent systems.

For those who want to learn more or get involved, Josh Bongard can be found through a Google search of his name, where one can access his lectures, papers, tutorials, and contact him directly for guidance. He believes that the field is at an exciting juncture where new ideas and approaches are not only welcome but necessary to advance the science of intelligence in both virtual and physical forms.

Checking Active Inference Institute/ActInf GuestStream 084.1 ~ Anthropocentric bias and the possibility of artificial cognition.txt
 The discussion revolved around understanding how large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 behave and respond to prompts. Charles and will explored the idea that LLMs might not be understanding us in the way humans do, but rather responding based on patterns learned during training. They emphasized the importance of distinguishing between different types of LLMs, particularly between those trained on vast datasets versus those with more circumscribed training data, where the data is known and can be surveyed.

Charles and will plan to expand their initial four-page paper for the ICML conference into a longer, more philosophically substantive work. This expansion will delve deeper into the philosophical implications of interacting with LLMs, exploring the mechanisms underlying their responses and how this affects our understanding of intelligence and cognition.

Their project aims to bridge the gap between cognitive science and language models, providing insights into how we can better communicate with and understand the limitations of these models. They see this as a valuable learning journey that brings together philosophy, cognitive science, and the practical implications of interacting with advanced AI systems.

Checking Active Inference Institute/ActInf MathStream 008.1 ~ R Servajean： Intro to Bayesian mechanics： state-based formalism (part 1).txt
 In this discussion, Daniel M. Kokotovic introduced the concept of the "world" formulation within the framework of active inference and free energy minimization. This approach focuses on the momentary response of an organism to sensory stimuli, considering autonomous actions as given and fixed. The key points from this part of the framework are:

1. **World Formulation**: It represents the environment as a set of states that can be perceived by an agent, considering both external stimuli and internal states.

2. **Active Inference**: This is a mechanism where agents infer their actions based on the expected sensory input under uncertainty, aiming to minimize free energy.

3. **Synchronization Map**: This map links the "blanket state" (a representation of the environment) to the actual sensory states received by an agent. It's crucial for understanding how agents interpret their environment.

4. **Variational Inference**: This is a method used to approximate posterior distributions, which is essential in active inference for making decisions under uncertainty.

5. **Generalized Coordinates of Motion**: By relaxing the white noise assumption, the framework considers more structured dynamics of the system, moving beyond the simple random walk assumption.

6. **Action Space**: The world formulation abstracts actions as a space of possible behaviors from which an agent can choose.

Richard Kruschke expressed that many of the concepts discussed could be simulated and that there are simulations in the literature demonstrating these principles, such as those found in a paper by Friston et al. that showcases the synchronization map in action.

The conversation concluded with a preview of Part Two of the framework discussion, which will delve into path-based formulations, considering not just momentary states but also future paths and higher-order cognitive abilities like planning.

It was emphasized that generalized synchrony does not necessarily mean loss of individuality or identity but can also involve differentiation to achieve a higher level of integration.

2. **Quantum Free Energy Principle (QFEP)**: The QFEP was introduced as a framework for understanding how agents, whether biological or artificial, can use multiple communication channels to create and maintain space-time structure. The principle suggests that communication itself can give rise to the fabric of space-time.

3. **Quantum Field Theory (QFT)**: A brief comparison was made between QFEP and QFT, highlighting their potential relationship in explaining the emergence of space-time from information processing.

4. **Integration vs. Differentiation**: The trade-off between integrating systems to achieve unity or differentiating them for the same purpose was discussed. This trade-off is part of a larger pursuit of unitarity, which seeks to understand how entities become unified in their interactions.

5. **Linguistic Opportunities**: Chris mentioned that he would elaborate on the role of language and communication in updating our speaking and understanding to reflect these principles in his upcoming lecture.

6. **Fine Tuning Assumption**: Dean expressed interest in clarifying Chris's comments regarding the fine tuning assumption within the context of common cause and how it relates to adjusting or sculpting systems for better integration.

7. **Course Schedule**: The course is halfway completed, with three lectures and discussions already held. The next session will cover how agents use multiple communication channels, leading into the quantum FEP and the emergence of space-time from communication. Session six will connect these concepts to biology and life, exploring their implications for understanding life and potential future developments.

8. **Participation Encouraged**: The course organizers encourage students and interested individuals to check out the course website, submit questions for Chris, register for upcoming participatory discussions, and engage with the material and community to contribute to the publication of collective insights.

9. **Final Thoughts**: The conversation concluded with an acknowledgment of the intellectual journey thus far and anticipation for the more complex and interesting topics ahead.

10. **Upcoming Topics**: The next topics include exploring communication across multiple channels, the quantum Free Energy Principle, and the emergence of space-time from communication, which will set the stage for understanding life and its potential in the future.

1. **Chicken and Egg Situation**: The discussion revolved around the question of which comes first when an agent develops the ability to perceive and assign spatial coordinates to its boundaries. Chris speculated that discrete location names might emerge before a metric system, with angular space being recognized before radial space.

2. **Phylogenetics and Embryology**: The relationship between phylogenetics (the study of the lineage of organisms) and embryology (the study of the development of an organism from zygote to adult) is seen as analogous, with Mike Levin and Chris discussing how both can be understood in similar terms.

3. **Object Persistence**: The ability for an agent to recognize the persistence of objects over time is crucial for understanding concepts like rotational symmetry. This recognition of object identity allows us to say that space has certain symmetries.

4. **Phylogeny as a Scattering Experiment**: Chris believes that phylogenetics can be understood as a kind of scattering experiment, similar to the high energy events studied in physics, with the lineage of Luca being analogous to human embryonic development.

5. **Weak Rotation and Time Flow**: The weak rotation operation in quantum mechanics was discussed in relation to the flow of time for agents separated by a boundary. It was explained that the direction of time for one agent (Alice) is opposite to that of another (Bob) due to the input-output cycle, which involves a sign change across the boundary.

6. **Upcoming Discussion**: The session concluded with an invitation for everyone to join a participatory discussion in about two weeks on Saturday to delve deeper into the topics discussed and to engage with the presented ideas.

1. In the context of programming languages, variable binding determines the semantics of a variable, which refers to the differences that make a difference in behavior or actionability. The semantics of a language is how it relates to other systems, and this relationship can be represented using mathematical constructs like category theory.

2. Scale-free theories, as opposed to reductive theories, are about the existence of phenomena at different scales and inherently involve semantics because they deal with the relationships between these scales. In reductive theories, especially in old-fashioned AI from the late 60s and early 70s, computation was often seen as purely syntactic without regard to semantics. However, semantics are crucial because they give meaning to computation.

3. The Functional Engineering Principle (FEP) emphasizes the importance of semantics by focusing on an agent's attempt to model its environment for actionable purposes. The FEP is intrinsically semantic because it deals with how an agent interacts with and affects its environment, rather than just passively observing or inferring.

4. The classical notion of a passive observer is misleading in both the context of quantum theory and functional engineering. There are no true passive observers; all observations and interactions affect the observed system to some extent.

5. The discussion highlights the importance of considering the active role of agents in their environments, as opposed to treating them as passive entities that merely infer or abstract information without engaging in meaningful action.
