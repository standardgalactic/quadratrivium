0	8600	Hi, humans here from Fast Tech Skills and in this video, I'm going to describe one of
8600	13600	the most important things that comes to technology and that's computer programming.
13600	19200	I'm going to actually take you through the most important concepts of computer programming.
19200	26120	So by the end of this video, if you have no idea how computer coding works, so you get
26120	31520	a really good idea at the end of this video and code like a code basis like this and source
31520	35440	code like this wouldn't be as scary as they are now.
35440	39880	So I just got this image from Google.
39880	44520	When you look at this image, it looks a little bit like intimidating, it's not as clear and
44520	46560	readable as you want it to be.
46560	52920	So I'm just going to take you through four important concepts of computer programming,
52920	57720	how we actually make computers do things.
57720	62520	Hopefully by the end of this video, you would be amazed how simple computer programming
62520	63520	could be.
63520	69440	So I'm just going to delete that photo for now and we will talk about four different
69440	70440	concepts.
70440	76240	Basically, if you know these four different concepts, then you kind of get how computers
76240	79120	work when it comes to computer coding.
79120	85360	So I'm just going to actually grab my proper tool here.
85360	88680	Okay, we've got the tool.
88680	93400	So we will have four kind of concepts here.
93400	100800	I'm going to separate the space for each of those so we know what we are doing in terms
100800	102880	of using the space.
102880	108720	The first one that we're going to talk about is step-by-step execution.
108720	110160	So what do we mean by that?
110160	118360	If I actually go ahead and make the brush a little bit smaller, so we have instructions.
118360	125040	So every single line of code basically could do something when you write it.
125040	129360	For example, a single line of code could print something on the screen.
129360	132700	So this could print something on screen.
132700	139420	Every single line of code could do a calculation, maybe calculate what two times three is,
139420	140620	and so on and so forth.
140620	145860	So every single line of code that you write on the screen could mean something, could
145860	149340	actually order the computer to do something.
149340	154980	In step-by-step execution, the machine actually goes through every single line step-by-step.
154980	162660	So the order starts from the top and executes every single line one after the other.
163300	168860	And this would be like a very simple basic way of executing commands.
168860	172140	This would be step-by-step.
172140	180500	So this is the most common and every single computer program would have such a structure
180500	182020	in it.
182020	185460	The next one is conditional execution.
185460	189940	And basically the way that works is we would have a condition.
189940	195900	So if the condition exists, we would execute a part of the code.
195900	199860	If not, we won't execute that part, we would probably execute something else.
199860	202260	So the condition works something like this.
202260	207420	We have an input coming in, a value, and then we evaluate it.
207420	215420	If the evaluation comes out as true or yes, we would go ahead and execute this piece of
215420	223340	code here, or if it's no, then we would execute this other piece of code that we've got for
223340	224940	the no condition.
224940	231340	The best example would be kind of if you press a button on your computer, that could be a
231340	232340	conditional.
232340	238060	So when the condition of pressing the button kind of is true, then the code specifically
238060	240060	for that button executes.
240060	245020	So in code, if you want to write it in this structure, we have the kind of the condition
245020	247140	at the top.
247140	256340	So the condition we write it in red, then if it's true, the green will be executed here.
256340	260660	If not, we can say that the orange will be executed.
260660	265580	So it's a very, very simple way of actually building a condition.
265580	271180	There are more sophisticated structures when it comes to conditionals, but you can get
271180	272180	the idea.
272180	276460	This part would be yes, and this part would be no.
276460	280780	Or you can get enough to know all together and have the rest of your program.
280780	284780	So if the condition exists, do something, if it doesn't exist, do nothing.
284780	287020	So that could be another way of implementing it.
287020	292100	Or vice versa, you can have if the condition doesn't exist, do something, or if it does
292100	293100	do nothing.
293100	296660	So you can arrange it in any way possible you want.
296660	299340	And this basically is the conditional structure.
299340	303620	We have a yes or no structure.
303620	305980	The next one are the loops.
305980	312860	And loops are pretty, pretty cool because it allows the computers to do tedious and hard
312860	313860	work for us.
313860	316740	It even helps us to write more efficient code.
316740	319020	So let's see how it works.
319020	321940	Let's say that we have some sort of instruction.
321940	323580	Actually let me draw something.
323580	325700	Let's say that we have apples.
325700	328300	Let's say these are apples here.
328300	333460	And we want to put these apples, we want to package them in boxes.
333460	338260	So let me go ahead and actually grab another color for the color of the box.
338260	344580	We have a box here and simply the instruction is that open the box.
344580	350420	So we open the box and we put the apple in.
350420	355820	So if I just change the color, so number one would be open the box.
355820	357340	So we open it.
357340	361100	We put the apple in and then we close the box.
361100	362980	So that'd be like closing the box.
362980	365220	So we have three steps.
365220	369620	And if we want to do that for thousands of apples, that's a tedious work.
369620	375340	So if we want to write it by step by step kind of instruction, we need to write thousands
375340	380020	of lines of code defining that open the box, put the apple in, close the box.
380020	385180	That would require as many times that we want to do the process, we need to write lines
385180	386180	of code.
386180	390360	And that kind of gives you the idea of what the loop is.
390360	397100	So if you want to make a way that it's going to automate this process, we can use loops.
397100	401980	Basically what loops do is we have some sort of instructions.
401980	406700	So the instruction could be as simple as open the box, that'd be step number one.
406700	409420	Put the apple in, close the box.
409420	414900	Then we can repeat this process as many times as we want.
414900	420980	So we can have a condition as long as the box or apples exist, do the process, or we
420980	426020	can say do the process one thousand or one million times.
426020	430860	Of course, these instructions could be printing a line on the screen, could be do some sort
430860	438740	of calculation, whatever it is, loops allow us to basically go ahead and execute a set
438740	445420	of instructions as many times as we want, which are very, very efficient and basically
445420	452380	shows the true power of computer science and computing at large scale.
452380	458220	The next one that we have, it's a bit kind of different than the other ones.
458220	467020	Let's say that we have a set of instructions, and then we want to do something here.
467420	474780	This thing that we want to do here has its own instruction, kind of its own box of instruction.
474780	480420	Let's say that we have an instruction for packaging apples, we have that separated in
480420	486220	a block of code, we call it a set of lines of code, kind of targeted to do something,
486220	490580	and we want to use that instruction in multiple places.
490700	498780	Instead of rewriting the code, then we can put that in a block and we can call that block
498780	502220	to be executed throughout our code.
502220	507740	Let's say that this is the apple packaging instruction, we separate it in the code, and
507740	515100	then we can call that kind of block of code to do the instruction, and then we go ahead
515100	517180	and do the next steps.
517180	523900	This is basically functions and kind of separating the code so we can reuse them.
523900	528940	It's a very, very important concept in computer programming, and there are more sophisticated
528940	534260	models to it, but for now, if there is something that we keep using, if there are set of instructions
534260	542820	that we keep using, then we just separate them in kind of a separate space in our code,
542820	548140	and then we put them in a kind of a block sort of thing.
548140	552020	There are some details to it, but for now, just imagine that you put them in a block
552020	557380	and you can call that block to do those tasks anywhere you want throughout your code.
557380	564020	So that's basically the last concept, so step by step, conditional loops and functions and
564020	567020	kind of reusability in your code.
567020	570540	So hope this video helped you to understand computer programming.
570540	576380	If you understand these four concepts, then it's very, very simple to understand how computers
576380	583180	work, because you can basically go ahead and break down every software on these constructing
583180	585460	modules or parts.
585460	586820	So that's it for this video.
