00:00.000 --> 00:26.280
So, you may not be aware of this, but Age of Empires has had quite the remarkable comeback

00:26.280 --> 00:28.080
over the past few years.

00:28.080 --> 00:33.240
This all started back in 2018 when Microsoft released a full-scale remaster of the original

00:33.240 --> 00:38.940
1997 Age of Empires under the title Age of Empires Definitive Edition.

00:38.940 --> 00:43.840
This was followed one year later with a Definitive Edition of its insanely popular sequel, a

00:43.840 --> 00:48.760
year later with the Definitive Edition of the first 3D game in the series Age of Empires

00:48.760 --> 00:53.320
3, and in an effort to keep the streak up, Microsoft just went ahead and made a new Age

00:53.320 --> 00:56.640
of Empires game and named it Age of Empires 4.

00:56.640 --> 00:59.000
So you're probably thinking what I was thinking, right?

00:59.000 --> 01:04.400
Big company like Microsoft suddenly making a bunch of cheap remakes of this classic series

01:04.400 --> 01:08.960
just to get people interested in it again so they can reboot the franchise.

01:08.960 --> 01:14.000
But here's the thing, every single one of these games has been well received, not just

01:14.000 --> 01:18.640
by the fans, not just by the media, but by the market too.

01:18.640 --> 01:23.520
The past few years have been a full-blown Age of Empires renaissance with active online

01:23.520 --> 01:28.320
communities, terrific age-focused YouTube channels like Spirit of the Law, and even

01:28.320 --> 01:33.000
a vibranese sports scene thanks to the Red Bull Wololo tournament that's been running

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
since 2000.

01:37.000 --> 01:41.700
The series has been so popular that earlier this year Microsoft released a console version

01:41.700 --> 01:47.880
of Age of Empires 2, a game that seems inconceivable to play without a mouse and keyboard.

01:47.880 --> 01:52.760
So I mean, that's gotta be a cash grab, there's no way people actually enjoyed playing it

01:52.920 --> 01:54.920
on a controller.

01:54.920 --> 01:59.800
So here's the thing, this is a bit of a selfish documentary because myself and my wife played

01:59.800 --> 02:06.120
dozens of hours of Age of Empires 2 Definitive Edition over the past few years, specifically

02:06.120 --> 02:08.320
during the COVID-19 lockdown.

02:08.320 --> 02:13.920
See we were 13 when Age of Empires 2 was originally released on PC, and like most PC gamers back

02:13.920 --> 02:19.160
then I was enthralled by its exciting balance of city building and real-time strategy.

02:19.160 --> 02:22.760
Age of Empires isn't the first real-time strategy game that Honor is usually given

02:22.760 --> 02:27.080
to Westwood's Dune 2, but it was a genre-defining game.

02:27.080 --> 02:32.040
A beautiful, isometric world with a collection of civilizations to choose from, each with

02:32.040 --> 02:35.160
their own language, buildings, and style of warfare.

02:35.160 --> 02:37.280
The battles were exciting, but manageable.

02:37.280 --> 02:41.360
There was a single-player story, but you could also create custom skirmishes with different

02:41.360 --> 02:44.120
rules on a variety of different landmasses.

02:44.120 --> 02:48.920
There were sea battles, there's early artillery, politics, religion.

02:48.920 --> 02:52.320
Age of Empires was basically chess on steroids.

02:52.320 --> 02:58.080
So during the pandemic, when we had to close the previous no-clip studios, I had to bring

02:58.080 --> 03:02.920
all that equipment back to my house, and I suddenly had like four desktop PCs just lying

03:02.920 --> 03:04.080
around my house.

03:04.080 --> 03:10.520
So myself and my wife decided to look for any PC game that we could play cooperatively.

03:10.520 --> 03:15.240
We had both played Age 2 while growing up, so we turned the spare bedroom into basically

03:15.240 --> 03:16.560
a LAN cafe.

03:16.560 --> 03:21.160
And so when our kid went to sleep, we'd burn the quarantine midnight oil, ganging up against

03:21.160 --> 03:23.520
some bots in custom skirmishes.

03:23.520 --> 03:27.960
It became so much of our day today that for Valentine's Day that year, she made me this

03:27.960 --> 03:28.960
card.

03:28.960 --> 03:33.600
Again, sorry, if you're not getting the willow-low thing, don't worry, we'll cover it later.

03:33.600 --> 03:37.800
So today we're going to dive into the resurrection of Age of Empires by talking to two of the

03:37.800 --> 03:41.800
folks at the studio that Microsoft spun up to helm this effort.

03:41.800 --> 03:47.800
Ernest Yon, executive producer at Worlds Edge, and Adam Icegreen, senior creative director

03:47.800 --> 03:49.080
at Worlds Edge.

03:49.080 --> 03:53.040
But before we dive into the nitty-gritty, I wanted to ask them where the decision to

03:53.040 --> 03:55.720
remake the first three games came from.

03:55.720 --> 03:59.800
You see, it's not like you couldn't play Age of Empires until these definitive editions

03:59.800 --> 04:00.800
came out.

04:00.800 --> 04:06.840
An HD remake of AOE 2 had been on Steam since 2013, and a version of Age 3 had been available

04:06.840 --> 04:08.840
on Steam since 07.

04:08.840 --> 04:13.560
Why did they think people wanted these new versions, and why is it they made the decision

04:13.560 --> 04:25.080
to remake all three?

04:25.080 --> 04:28.960
You know, a lot of people in that time were like, oh, Archeist games are dead, right?

04:28.960 --> 04:33.520
They got eaten by MOBAs, they got eaten by Tower of Defense games, your farm bills, whatever,

04:33.520 --> 04:35.520
you know, let this genre split.

04:35.520 --> 04:40.400
And when we put the catalog up, the crazy thing was that we're like, wait, people are

04:40.400 --> 04:46.480
engaging with this, like with long sessions, and more people keep coming to the title.

04:46.480 --> 04:51.960
And we really were like, well, wait, maybe Archeist isn't dead, like, what could we do

04:51.960 --> 04:53.120
here?

04:53.120 --> 04:57.200
And I think that was that plus what we wanted to do with Age 4, when they're like, hey,

04:57.200 --> 04:59.600
if we made a new Age game, what would we do?

04:59.600 --> 05:04.000
I think that all contributed to us being like, boy, these games are in kind of rough shape.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.240
Can we preserve them better?

05:06.240 --> 05:08.040
Can we do a better job with networking?

05:08.040 --> 05:11.880
I mean, there's some poops people have to jump through right to play them.

05:11.880 --> 05:12.880
Can we make that better?

05:12.880 --> 05:17.360
And, you know, that kind of started the whole conversation towards what Definitive Editions

05:17.360 --> 05:18.360
became.

05:18.360 --> 05:24.000
I would say that you start above just over five years ago is when we start doing it.

05:24.000 --> 05:30.840
We kind of like did it in parallel when the Age of Empires 4 project was like being discussed

05:30.840 --> 05:31.840
and then start.

05:31.840 --> 05:36.880
And then we say like, hey, you know what would be awesome is we have a chance to actually

05:36.880 --> 05:40.080
bring all the original Age of Empires back as well.

05:40.080 --> 05:46.040
So by the time Age 4 comes out, then everyone already like have the chance to recently would

05:46.040 --> 05:48.480
play all the all the awesome Age of Empires games.

05:48.480 --> 05:50.680
We want to make all the age fans happy.

05:50.680 --> 05:56.840
So that's why when we signed the project, we got approval to do all of them.

05:56.840 --> 05:59.720
One was never actually re-released.

05:59.720 --> 06:04.840
So when we re-released Definitive Edition, that was the first time that we bring it back.

06:04.840 --> 06:10.080
But in terms of production, we did do one first and then go to two and then three started

06:10.080 --> 06:11.600
in parallel as well.

06:11.600 --> 06:18.880
So but the idea is like, hey, let's learn how to do real-time strategy games the right

06:18.880 --> 06:20.480
way again.

06:20.480 --> 06:24.680
You could almost say that Age 1 is like the national game of Vietnam.

06:24.680 --> 06:26.880
It's almost like Starcraft is for Korea.

06:27.360 --> 06:30.160
It's crazy, but they only play Age 1.

06:30.160 --> 06:35.520
Like they don't they're not really into Age 2 and then yet Age 2 has surpassed a lot

06:35.520 --> 06:41.000
of people because I think it's just how globally accessible it is, right?

06:41.000 --> 06:45.760
It's just like there's there's hey, one of your your nation or a previous nation that

06:45.760 --> 06:49.360
became your nation is in that game somewhere, right?

06:49.360 --> 06:53.600
Every one of them just has such a unique player base and I think that's because each game

06:53.680 --> 06:58.160
kind of has its own rhythm to it and its own pacing and people have fallen in love with

06:58.160 --> 07:01.000
the unique stick of each one.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.680
So it's funny when you say like, well, did one replace the other?

07:04.680 --> 07:05.800
No, they never did.

07:07.960 --> 07:11.400
Yeah, Age of Time has one was special for that reason.

07:11.400 --> 07:19.000
You really teach us a lot of foundation work on how to redo all the art, how to like really

07:19.000 --> 07:25.120
build a game across different regions of the world at the same time, get all the like

07:25.120 --> 07:29.920
really, really smart people together that are passionate about Age of Empires to work

07:29.920 --> 07:32.520
together on the projects.

07:32.520 --> 07:37.240
We set up a whole studio for Age of Empires, like literally this one, this one we did.

07:37.240 --> 07:41.240
We have all these wonderful sister studio partners that work with us, right?

07:41.240 --> 07:46.960
Tana, Liz, Forgotten Empires, Relic, just name a few and they all end up working in

07:47.000 --> 07:51.560
different aspects on pretty much every Age of Empires game because they all have such

07:51.560 --> 07:55.720
unique strengths that they all get pulled in at some point.

07:55.720 --> 07:59.000
It's like, it starts, well, it's just going to be Relic and it is for a while and it's

07:59.000 --> 08:02.200
like, Hey, Forgotten Empires, can you come in and help us with some tuning and like, oh,

08:02.200 --> 08:06.440
hey, can you do this part of the code over here that we, yeah, it's a big family.

08:06.440 --> 08:09.760
Actually, matter of fact, there's a lot of Command and Conquer people here myself.

08:09.760 --> 08:15.680
Yeah, like I was on all the CNC games except for the very first one and there's two others

08:15.720 --> 08:20.280
from Westwood as well that are on my team that are on our team that all work on the

08:20.280 --> 08:21.880
game now, which is kind of fun.

08:21.880 --> 08:27.520
But we did talk to a lot of X Ensemble people since we have friends and we get to talk to

08:27.520 --> 08:28.520
them.

08:28.520 --> 08:32.400
It was really cool that a lot of them still remember Age of Empires really fondly.

08:32.400 --> 08:36.520
So they want us to do well and was pretty helpful.

08:42.720 --> 08:44.600
We actually learned a lot of things from one.

08:44.640 --> 08:49.960
So for one, the project itself, we definitely like try to bring up the quality of life.

08:49.960 --> 08:55.000
We added a new user interface so we can actually tell what's going on.

08:55.000 --> 08:59.800
We actually try running the original code as is and the pixels are so big that you can

08:59.800 --> 09:01.680
actually see it anymore.

09:01.680 --> 09:03.920
It is amazing.

09:03.920 --> 09:08.280
But there are just so many conventions that people are so used to.

09:08.280 --> 09:12.400
Then we also need to like, Hey, but the fans play Age of Empires one because it is Age

09:12.400 --> 09:13.720
of Empires one.

09:13.720 --> 09:18.920
So we want to make sure that we keep the spirit of Age of Empires one, the code to be the

09:18.920 --> 09:19.920
same.

09:19.920 --> 09:22.320
So we ended up using a plan.

09:22.320 --> 09:26.760
We actually updated the engine instead of creating a new engine.

09:26.760 --> 09:31.320
We did do some experiment of complete, do a new engine for a little bit.

09:31.320 --> 09:36.120
But then really quickly, you find out that they are timing the feel of it.

09:36.120 --> 09:40.560
Keeping the feel is very important to us because that's what the fans want, right?

09:40.560 --> 09:45.880
Man, a lot of people, they had this fondness in their head for what Age one looked like.

09:45.880 --> 09:51.040
I actually originally, we wanted to, I had posed the idea of starting every game on the

09:51.040 --> 09:56.320
original graphics and then it blur, like I'll pixel and then it blurs into the new version.

09:56.320 --> 10:00.800
But the asset load was so crazy from the new version that we're like, we can't even hold

10:00.800 --> 10:04.200
the memory to have the pixelated versions in there.

10:04.200 --> 10:08.880
The original assets are pretty much unusable for us to go forwards with.

10:08.880 --> 10:13.560
So we had to redo everything from scratch.

10:13.560 --> 10:19.840
We're trying to learn where the bar is, like the authenticity bar versus like high-res bar,

10:19.840 --> 10:23.880
like where do you draw the line and we have to learn where that is.

10:23.880 --> 10:29.920
But we have learned that from two, from one, that if you get too close to the original,

10:29.920 --> 10:34.320
all the original fans will love it, but it makes it really hard for new people to join.

10:38.880 --> 10:52.880
So for two, we set up, one of our goals, we actually write on the whiteboard, they say,

10:52.880 --> 11:00.320
we want to build the Age of Empires 2 you remember, not the reality that you see.

11:00.320 --> 11:04.800
You know, fortunately, given the size of the game and given the zooms, there was certain,

11:05.280 --> 11:08.960
that puts some restrictions on how big they had to be, how detailed they had to be.

11:08.960 --> 11:13.400
So it made the modeling a little simpler, but to get to 4K assets, everything had to

11:13.400 --> 11:20.160
be redone, all the animations, all of the states, every single sprite rotation that

11:20.160 --> 11:25.520
we have to do, creating 3D assets of them because it's just easier to animate them quickly

11:25.520 --> 11:28.600
instead of having to draw all the, because you'd have to do keyframes and then do all

11:28.600 --> 11:32.000
the tweens and like if you're doing classical animation.

11:32.000 --> 11:36.880
So it's just easier to do it in 3D that way to capture all of the animations.

11:36.880 --> 11:41.400
And then one of the challenge, the big challenge was converting the eight facings so they didn't

11:41.400 --> 11:46.080
just pop into a blend so that we could have kind of more smooth rotations.

11:46.080 --> 11:49.600
If you go back and you look at the old, a lot of the old RTS games, they've only eight

11:49.600 --> 11:50.880
directions for anything.

11:50.880 --> 11:53.960
So you get things to go mm, mm, right?

11:53.960 --> 11:58.680
And we blended them, but we had to maintain the timing of the original because as Ernest

11:58.680 --> 12:00.720
said, feel was so important.

12:00.720 --> 12:04.680
There was a lot of logic and code that went into making sure that, again, we maintained

12:04.680 --> 12:08.960
feel even though we could improve the visuals.

12:08.960 --> 12:13.760
Like noise is always an issue in RTS games because you want really clean reads, right?

12:13.760 --> 12:17.640
I mean, like if you really think about it, RTS games at their core are three elements.

12:17.640 --> 12:21.200
There's units, structures and things that block me, right?

12:21.200 --> 12:24.960
And then the things that block me can be a building, it could be water, it could be,

12:24.960 --> 12:27.120
you know, a hill, whatever.

12:27.120 --> 12:30.720
But like that's really what you need to be able to, a player needs to be able to read

12:30.720 --> 12:32.080
that in seconds, right?

12:32.080 --> 12:36.120
And so silhouettes were insanely important to us.

12:36.120 --> 12:37.560
And so that was a challenge, right?

12:37.560 --> 12:42.400
Because if you have all this super detail on the units is that if you crush it down directly,

12:42.400 --> 12:43.480
you just get noise.

12:43.480 --> 12:45.560
And then it's hard to read the units.

12:45.560 --> 12:49.600
So a lot of care was taken in making sure that things like if they had shields, that

12:49.600 --> 12:54.360
the shield remained relatively clean, even if different resolution scales such that if

12:54.360 --> 12:57.960
that was a key reader, that unit that would maintain, right?

12:57.960 --> 13:01.640
And that we had to do that with each kind of unit to make sure that the unit's still

13:01.640 --> 13:07.320
read is the units.

13:07.320 --> 13:15.160
For voices, for each two, for example, we did record all the voices, many can be voices.

13:15.160 --> 13:20.200
So those are the things that we completely record for each of them as two.

13:20.600 --> 13:30.840
For authenticity, we wanted to keep as much as we could.

13:30.840 --> 13:35.960
If we had good source and could clean it up, we would do that over re-recording.

13:35.960 --> 13:36.960
Right.

13:36.960 --> 13:41.520
Yeah, you didn't have anyone shouting walla-la-la into a microphone at this time.

13:41.520 --> 13:42.520
Right.

13:42.520 --> 13:47.120
That was from like a sample library.

13:47.120 --> 13:52.880
We did re-record walla-la-la, actually, because of that we didn't want to, because there was

13:52.880 --> 13:58.640
a time, I think, when people were pretty fast and loose with audio assets in terms of ownership,

13:58.640 --> 14:02.880
and we wanted to make sure that this time around we were doing the DEs, that everything

14:02.880 --> 14:04.760
was buttoned up in that respect.

14:04.760 --> 14:08.320
Do you have any idea why that was chosen for that particular unit?

14:08.320 --> 14:09.920
I don't know.

14:09.920 --> 14:10.920
I do not know.

14:10.920 --> 14:16.800
I think it was literally something like the name of the audio sample was like priest chant

14:16.800 --> 14:20.160
or something like that, and maybe they just saw it, like, oh, priest chant, maybe that'll

14:20.160 --> 14:29.040
work, and they're like, well, okay, let's just do it.

14:29.040 --> 14:34.840
Every definitive revision game we reached out to the communities that were holding those

14:34.840 --> 14:35.840
games up.

14:35.840 --> 14:38.720
I mean, a lot of these games were maintained by the community for years and years and years

14:38.720 --> 14:41.040
without us being involved at all.

14:41.040 --> 14:44.380
So we reached out to them, and we're like, hey, we'd love to improve these.

14:44.380 --> 14:45.960
What would you like to see?

14:45.960 --> 14:48.920
We don't want to break the spirit of the game, like, absolutely.

14:48.920 --> 14:51.840
So how can we improve them without breaking them?

14:51.840 --> 14:54.680
Because there's a certain, I think there's a certain amount of things that you would

14:54.680 --> 15:00.120
love to modernize sometimes, but that would not make it age one or age two.

15:00.120 --> 15:03.840
If you're familiar with age two, you know that things like when we put in auto-scouting,

15:03.840 --> 15:08.880
how contentious that was for some people, even though then you play it and you're like,

15:08.880 --> 15:09.880
well, okay, I get it.

15:09.880 --> 15:10.880
For new players, it works.

15:10.880 --> 15:12.680
I'm not going to use it as an advanced player.

15:12.680 --> 15:17.160
We, some folks remember that, for example, for age two, we actually run multiple betas

15:17.160 --> 15:23.280
that were literally like, I think the first time was like tens of thousands of people.

15:23.280 --> 15:28.480
And like right before ship, we have like lots of people because we want to stress the server.

15:28.480 --> 15:33.000
We also want to see what people always have an opinion on what they like and what they

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
don't like.

15:34.000 --> 15:37.720
Ideally, we do those before the game even comes out.

15:37.720 --> 15:41.280
And of course, we have our internal QA teams, and they know the game very, very well.

15:43.680 --> 15:49.360
So for years, real-time strategy developers have tried to make their PC games work on

15:49.360 --> 15:53.120
consoles, and we've had mixed results.

15:53.120 --> 15:57.800
Some of the better examples are games that were developed from the ground up for consoles,

15:57.800 --> 16:00.120
but that wasn't really an option here.

16:00.120 --> 16:04.600
Console players wanted to play Age of Empires after all, not some reduced version.

16:04.600 --> 16:09.360
And that's what makes the console version of Age of Empires two so interesting.

16:09.360 --> 16:13.480
You see, the various teams working alongside World's Edge made some fairly significant

16:13.480 --> 16:17.320
changes to the game to get it to flow properly on consoles.

16:17.320 --> 16:21.600
Not just new interface elements to better suit the controller, but full-blown automation

16:21.600 --> 16:26.200
systems to unburden the player from some of the game's micro, especially with how you

16:26.200 --> 16:29.120
assign citizens to collect various resources.

16:29.120 --> 16:33.680
So how did they change so much and still seem to satisfy these players?

16:33.680 --> 16:39.680
As your economy grows, you will train more villagers and gather different types of resources.

16:39.680 --> 16:44.360
Villager priorities automatically distribute your villagers between resources, making it

16:44.360 --> 16:46.360
easier to manage your economy.

16:51.360 --> 16:57.200
So when we first started being part of the Xbox organization, we did talk about, hey,

16:57.200 --> 17:02.040
do we need to do Xbox version as well?

17:02.040 --> 17:07.960
Luckily, our boss Shannon Loftis at the time said like, no, concentrate, make the best

17:07.960 --> 17:10.840
PC game that you guys can.

17:10.840 --> 17:14.480
And we have space to really focus on the PC version.

17:14.480 --> 17:15.480
And that's what we did.

17:15.480 --> 17:20.280
We spent all our resources to make sure we get the best games out possible.

17:20.280 --> 17:25.360
So I've made, over the years, I think I've made four console RTSs, starting with Red Alert

17:25.360 --> 17:28.400
on the PlayStation and then going through the years.

17:28.400 --> 17:34.120
My previous one was Universal War, right, by Sega put out.

17:34.120 --> 17:38.120
So there's been a history of us kind of working on it and trying to think through them.

17:38.120 --> 17:41.720
The big thing is just the fundamental difference of a mouse is a precision instrument.

17:41.720 --> 17:45.840
It's like, I click this thing, I click it over here, I'm making very precisiony kind

17:45.840 --> 17:51.720
of movements, right, where a controller is like, I drive, I move a camera, I move a unit,

17:51.720 --> 17:54.240
like I do something direct.

17:54.680 --> 17:59.080
It's really hard to make the two of those work together.

17:59.080 --> 18:03.880
So we did a lot, a lot of experimentation, I mean, just a ton.

18:03.880 --> 18:08.640
And I have to say that Phil Spencer was really like, when am I going to get my console version?

18:08.640 --> 18:10.920
Because Phil loves the Xbox.

18:10.920 --> 18:14.800
And so the whole time that we were like, no, we want to do the PC first, and then we'll

18:14.800 --> 18:16.960
think about console, which is what we did.

18:16.960 --> 18:20.840
But he was just like, no, I want, when, when am I going to get this?

18:20.840 --> 18:21.840
And he plays.

18:21.840 --> 18:24.840
You go online right now and you can see him playing a couple of times a week.

18:24.840 --> 18:25.840
It's great.

18:29.840 --> 18:36.160
After H2 comes out, I would say every single time we made any announcement of anything

18:36.160 --> 18:41.080
we, someone is going to be in the feedback comment session where it's like, when is it

18:41.080 --> 18:42.080
coming to Xbox?

18:42.080 --> 18:43.080
When is it coming to Xbox?

18:43.080 --> 18:49.440
Literally, I want to say like two years, like non-stop, that fans are asking for it.

18:49.440 --> 18:52.960
Like I mentioned earlier, our studio principle is to make our fans happy.

18:52.960 --> 18:57.920
At a certain point, we say like, okay, this is not just one of you guys, you really need

18:57.920 --> 19:00.480
to like make this work.

19:00.480 --> 19:04.240
So we started to look at it seriously.

19:04.240 --> 19:09.040
The fun part is from a production standpoint, like we internally try to hook up a controller

19:09.040 --> 19:14.600
directly to emulate the mouse, because when you ask a programmer how you would do it,

19:14.600 --> 19:17.040
that's exactly what a lot of games have done, right?

19:17.040 --> 19:25.480
They look at like, this is the mouse, and A and B, which is like, man, was it bad?

19:25.480 --> 19:28.600
The mouse you can actually move across the screen really quickly.

19:28.600 --> 19:33.560
And the way that people play on PC is they click on the screen and then they hockey back

19:33.560 --> 19:35.160
and then click on the game right.

19:35.160 --> 19:38.280
You can't do that with the analog stand.

19:38.280 --> 19:40.080
It is just way too slow.

19:40.080 --> 19:45.000
The game example we actually talk about is actually Diablo, because when you look at

19:45.000 --> 19:48.200
like Diablo, it is a very mouse click game, right?

19:48.200 --> 19:53.240
So they click a lot, but they transition to console really well.

19:53.240 --> 19:57.120
What's the Diablo equivalent for real time strategy game for each of the empires?

19:57.120 --> 20:01.960
That's literally like how we start thinking then, okay, let's make these things feels

20:01.960 --> 20:03.800
really good first.

20:03.800 --> 20:09.440
And in order for that pacing to be right, you cannot just do the repetitive pick a guy,

20:09.440 --> 20:11.920
do this pick a guy, this you can, but it is boring.

20:11.920 --> 20:15.160
That is not how people want to interact with the game.

20:15.160 --> 20:21.200
So the AI is done in a way to help take a lot of the tedious workout, but we actually make

20:21.200 --> 20:25.320
sure that you get to pick the automation level.

20:25.320 --> 20:29.300
So all these strategic decisions are still made by you, the player.

20:29.300 --> 20:34.840
So that was very important for us to make sure that it is not like auto everything and

20:34.840 --> 20:36.760
then you don't even have to play the game.

20:36.760 --> 20:41.640
But it's auto enough that you can enjoy the game and enjoy making strategic decisions.

20:41.640 --> 20:45.680
So that was the key, key part on how the team actually come together.

20:45.680 --> 20:52.720
And once that happened, we had the contest sensitive, sorry, site-based command manual,

20:52.720 --> 20:55.640
then magic happens.

20:55.640 --> 21:01.320
Based on my previous work and Tanlist's previous work on doing things like city skylines and

21:01.320 --> 21:04.640
other games that they've done, we're like, okay, we need to put our minds together and

21:04.640 --> 21:07.840
figure out what interface would really work here.

21:07.840 --> 21:11.960
And the radials and all that stuff came out of that, but the thing that really was fascinating

21:11.960 --> 21:14.320
is watching how it evolved.

21:14.320 --> 21:19.760
Like the thing that really brought about what I feel is it's really hard to go back, honestly,

21:19.760 --> 21:24.320
even to some of the stuff on PC now from what we've done on console with villager automation

21:24.320 --> 21:28.960
and the contextual actions based on, that was the original conversation.

21:28.960 --> 21:31.440
I'm like, I want contextual actions in here, how do we do it?

21:31.440 --> 21:34.680
All of that, like click on a gold mine, just build the gold mine, please.

21:35.680 --> 21:41.280
Like all of that, and it's great to see that people are really enjoying it, but all of

21:41.280 --> 21:42.800
that came about through time.

21:42.800 --> 21:48.200
And just, we were really fortunate that we were prototyping console controls.

21:48.200 --> 21:51.640
I mean, probably even before we admitted it, to be honest with you.

21:51.640 --> 21:57.360
I think that we were, we've been working on them since right around the ship of, I think

21:57.360 --> 21:58.720
after DE3.

21:58.720 --> 22:02.120
We started messing around with the radials and trying to figure out what to do with it

22:02.120 --> 22:03.680
and how we could do it.

22:03.680 --> 22:07.720
We had some people free on one of the teams and we're like, all right, let's just go to

22:07.720 --> 22:10.960
town on this and figure out how to make it work.

22:12.960 --> 22:16.480
I've always said that RTS games are basically, you're spinning plates, right?

22:16.480 --> 22:18.240
You're balancing plates on sticks.

22:18.240 --> 22:22.640
And it's how many plates can you keep going at once and which ones are you letting falter

22:22.640 --> 22:24.520
determines how good of a player you are.

22:24.520 --> 22:28.440
So just because the villagers are automated doesn't mean they're optimal.

22:28.440 --> 22:34.320
Our goal is never to replace the high-end meta with something that's automated, right?

22:34.320 --> 22:37.720
It should be something that allows people of the same level to be like, we're just going

22:37.720 --> 22:41.400
to have fun and I don't need to worry about this as much so I can concentrate on fighting

22:41.400 --> 22:45.480
and scouting and building buildings.

22:45.480 --> 22:47.800
One of the things we always say about the age games is we always want to make sure we

22:47.800 --> 22:51.680
leave room for mastery, that that can have its moments, right?

22:51.680 --> 22:55.440
And that people can get good and very good at doing certain things.

22:55.440 --> 22:59.120
And so, but villager automation was one of the things that we thought like, okay, people

22:59.120 --> 23:04.720
might be a little upset over it, but it's not going to break the high-end of the game,

23:04.720 --> 23:05.720
right?

23:05.720 --> 23:07.720
The spirit of the game.

23:07.720 --> 23:12.920
The villager automation AI and it's actually a lower level AI and debt has evolved over

23:12.920 --> 23:15.680
time completely separately as well.

23:15.680 --> 23:22.120
And the reason we get to do a DE AI is because the game has now has been played for two decades

23:22.120 --> 23:25.440
now and actually pro players, they play it.

23:25.440 --> 23:30.000
So what we have done is during development of declarative editions, we actually look

23:30.000 --> 23:34.200
at how these pro players, what strategies do they use?

23:34.200 --> 23:39.480
And we actually adapt and edit those strategy and bring it to a game, for example, like,

23:39.480 --> 23:44.080
hey, it's open field, you build crossbowmen, that we build it into the game so that people

23:44.080 --> 23:50.400
actually realize how to, the AI actually have that understanding and apply those strategies

23:50.400 --> 23:51.960
like a pro player would.

23:51.960 --> 23:56.120
So that is how we edit it.

23:56.120 --> 24:00.360
I have this strict theory about video games that I call the one button of fun.

24:00.360 --> 24:04.400
It's like, anytime I should be able to push a button and have some fun, be that, you know,

24:04.400 --> 24:07.640
in a main menu, I want to get into the game, just stop with all the, just one button, let

24:07.640 --> 24:08.640
me just say have fun.

24:08.640 --> 24:11.840
Like, but in the game, you're like, I want, especially RTS games, right?

24:11.840 --> 24:17.000
RTS games are all about, if you think about it, a click in an RTS game is insane.

24:17.000 --> 24:20.120
Like with one click, you select a bunch of units, you clicked across the map.

24:20.400 --> 24:23.880
Well, you just did a click, but what did you really see in your mind?

24:23.880 --> 24:26.560
Go here, go this way, go the way I intended you to do.

24:26.560 --> 24:29.760
Make sure you engage or don't engage, right, the things that I want.

24:29.760 --> 24:33.280
Go around that rock this way, don't go over that, make sure you go this, why aren't you

24:33.280 --> 24:34.280
listening to me?

24:34.280 --> 24:35.280
Right?

24:35.280 --> 24:37.200
And all you did was click.

24:37.200 --> 24:41.640
And so, how can we take more of that into the console?

24:41.640 --> 24:45.120
And I think that was part of our driving spirit was like, how do we just make it a click,

24:45.120 --> 24:46.120
a button?

24:46.120 --> 24:47.480
Like, do the thing.

24:47.480 --> 24:48.480
Don't make me hunt for it.

24:48.480 --> 24:52.280
Don't maybe dive into a building to get to a thing to do, like Blacksmith to do this

24:52.280 --> 24:53.280
thing.

24:53.280 --> 24:54.280
I can do it right here.

24:54.280 --> 24:59.800
That, I think, was our finding like, pull those, bubble it up, I guess, for the console

24:59.800 --> 25:01.520
to make it just much more accessible.

25:01.520 --> 25:19.520
It's actually good that we did them one at a time because we would find a feature that

25:19.520 --> 25:20.520
we would love, right?

25:20.520 --> 25:23.520
Or we would experiment and say, oh, let's try putting this in.

25:23.520 --> 25:24.520
And it would be so great.

25:24.520 --> 25:26.880
We're like, well, it has to go in all the DEs now.

25:26.880 --> 25:30.640
And then we'd have to figure out how to move that feature across the games given all the

25:30.640 --> 25:33.600
different engines and the different tech.

25:33.600 --> 25:34.600
But it's been fun.

25:34.600 --> 25:42.680
It's been a fun journey of learning and leapfrogging all of those DEs in order to create the package.

25:42.680 --> 25:43.680
It's been great.

25:43.680 --> 25:49.240
Just the features, as we leapfrog features, we put Art of War in because I really wanted

25:49.240 --> 25:52.160
to help people learn how to play RTS games.

25:52.160 --> 25:54.680
And then we're like, this is so good, it has to go in all the games.

25:54.680 --> 25:56.840
And so then it ended up in three and four.

25:56.840 --> 25:58.800
And now, what's the myth version of Art of War?

25:58.800 --> 26:01.160
Well, we've got to figure that out.

26:01.160 --> 26:03.440
How do we manifest that?

26:03.440 --> 26:07.600
Things like villager automation and context management, do we have that show up now from

26:07.600 --> 26:08.600
now on?

26:08.600 --> 26:10.000
Is that just part of the game?

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
We've got to talk about that.

26:12.000 --> 26:16.760
How do we bring that alive if we want to across all the games and what do we do with it?

26:16.760 --> 26:18.000
So it's been great.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.840
A lot of the learnings and everything that we take from every game we're just going to

26:20.840 --> 26:23.800
roll forward with and keep evolving.

26:23.800 --> 26:27.520
The English pretensions in Scotland are surely at an end.

26:27.520 --> 26:29.800
The forces of Wallace are triumphant.

26:29.800 --> 26:38.800
I think that we, a lot of the sentiment got to people about like, oh, this is long in

26:38.800 --> 26:39.800
the tooth.

26:39.800 --> 26:44.080
RTS really did have a heyday and the industry is very cyclical, I guess is the way to put

26:44.080 --> 26:45.080
it.

26:45.080 --> 26:46.920
Where something will come up and come down and come up and come down, there's a time

26:46.920 --> 26:51.840
for racers, there's a time for shooters, what the really hot thing is.

26:51.840 --> 26:58.080
And I think the great thing is that RTS never really went away completely, but it did wane

26:58.080 --> 27:00.040
in terms of being in the public eye.

27:00.040 --> 27:04.760
I think everyone was waiting for someone to take a bet on a big game again, a big RTS

27:04.760 --> 27:05.760
game.

27:05.760 --> 27:07.320
And that's what we did with age four.

27:07.320 --> 27:12.880
And now it's honestly, it's kind of delightful to see that we've got what, three splinter

27:12.880 --> 27:18.600
companies from Blizzard that are all working on RTS games of different types, right?

27:18.600 --> 27:22.360
Everyone was just waiting for someone to take that like, hey, this can be quality and look,

27:22.360 --> 27:24.040
it can be successful.

27:24.040 --> 27:27.040
And then everybody else was ready to dive in.

27:27.040 --> 27:28.040
See?

27:28.040 --> 27:30.400
HFM Pass 2 is now a generation game.

27:30.400 --> 27:37.080
So they are literally people who now have their own kids that they try to play with.

27:37.080 --> 27:42.080
So we want to make sure you get to someone, maybe, maybe one person play on the console

27:42.080 --> 27:45.480
and the other person play on the PC and they can play with each other.

27:45.480 --> 27:47.960
When we do something, we go all out.

27:47.960 --> 27:50.600
We are very happy with how the games turn out.

27:50.600 --> 27:54.960
Hopefully the fans will continue to support us and listen to the fans, so keep telling

27:54.960 --> 27:57.080
us what they like, what they don't like.

27:57.080 --> 28:00.920
And we want to keep building each of empires more and more.
