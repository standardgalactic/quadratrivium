1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,280
So, you may not be aware of this, but Age of Empires has had quite the remarkable comeback

2
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,080
over the past few years.

3
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,240
This all started back in 2018 when Microsoft released a full-scale remaster of the original

4
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:38,940
1997 Age of Empires under the title Age of Empires Definitive Edition.

5
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,840
This was followed one year later with a Definitive Edition of its insanely popular sequel, a

6
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,760
year later with the Definitive Edition of the first 3D game in the series Age of Empires

7
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:53,320
3, and in an effort to keep the streak up, Microsoft just went ahead and made a new Age

8
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,640
of Empires game and named it Age of Empires 4.

9
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,000
So you're probably thinking what I was thinking, right?

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,400
Big company like Microsoft suddenly making a bunch of cheap remakes of this classic series

11
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,960
just to get people interested in it again so they can reboot the franchise.

12
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,000
But here's the thing, every single one of these games has been well received, not just

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,640
by the fans, not just by the media, but by the market too.

14
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,520
The past few years have been a full-blown Age of Empires renaissance with active online

15
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,320
communities, terrific age-focused YouTube channels like Spirit of the Law, and even

16
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,000
a vibranese sports scene thanks to the Red Bull Wololo tournament that's been running

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
since 2000.

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,700
The series has been so popular that earlier this year Microsoft released a console version

19
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:47,880
of Age of Empires 2, a game that seems inconceivable to play without a mouse and keyboard.

20
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,760
So I mean, that's gotta be a cash grab, there's no way people actually enjoyed playing it

21
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,920
on a controller.

22
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,800
So here's the thing, this is a bit of a selfish documentary because myself and my wife played

23
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:06,120
dozens of hours of Age of Empires 2 Definitive Edition over the past few years, specifically

24
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,320
during the COVID-19 lockdown.

25
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:13,920
See we were 13 when Age of Empires 2 was originally released on PC, and like most PC gamers back

26
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,160
then I was enthralled by its exciting balance of city building and real-time strategy.

27
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,760
Age of Empires isn't the first real-time strategy game that Honor is usually given

28
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:27,080
to Westwood's Dune 2, but it was a genre-defining game.

29
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:32,040
A beautiful, isometric world with a collection of civilizations to choose from, each with

30
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,160
their own language, buildings, and style of warfare.

31
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,280
The battles were exciting, but manageable.

32
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,360
There was a single-player story, but you could also create custom skirmishes with different

33
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,120
rules on a variety of different landmasses.

34
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,920
There were sea battles, there's early artillery, politics, religion.

35
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:52,320
Age of Empires was basically chess on steroids.

36
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:58,080
So during the pandemic, when we had to close the previous no-clip studios, I had to bring

37
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,920
all that equipment back to my house, and I suddenly had like four desktop PCs just lying

38
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,080
around my house.

39
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,520
So myself and my wife decided to look for any PC game that we could play cooperatively.

40
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:15,240
We had both played Age 2 while growing up, so we turned the spare bedroom into basically

41
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,560
a LAN cafe.

42
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,160
And so when our kid went to sleep, we'd burn the quarantine midnight oil, ganging up against

43
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,520
some bots in custom skirmishes.

44
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,960
It became so much of our day today that for Valentine's Day that year, she made me this

45
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,960
card.

46
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,600
Again, sorry, if you're not getting the willow-low thing, don't worry, we'll cover it later.

47
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,800
So today we're going to dive into the resurrection of Age of Empires by talking to two of the

48
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,800
folks at the studio that Microsoft spun up to helm this effort.

49
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:47,800
Ernest Yon, executive producer at Worlds Edge, and Adam Icegreen, senior creative director

50
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,080
at Worlds Edge.

51
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,040
But before we dive into the nitty-gritty, I wanted to ask them where the decision to

52
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,720
remake the first three games came from.

53
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,800
You see, it's not like you couldn't play Age of Empires until these definitive editions

54
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,800
came out.

55
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:06,840
An HD remake of AOE 2 had been on Steam since 2013, and a version of Age 3 had been available

56
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,840
on Steam since 07.

57
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:13,560
Why did they think people wanted these new versions, and why is it they made the decision

58
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:25,080
to remake all three?

59
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,960
You know, a lot of people in that time were like, oh, Archeist games are dead, right?

60
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,520
They got eaten by MOBAs, they got eaten by Tower of Defense games, your farm bills, whatever,

61
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,520
you know, let this genre split.

62
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,400
And when we put the catalog up, the crazy thing was that we're like, wait, people are

63
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:46,480
engaging with this, like with long sessions, and more people keep coming to the title.

64
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:51,960
And we really were like, well, wait, maybe Archeist isn't dead, like, what could we do

65
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,120
here?

66
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,200
And I think that was that plus what we wanted to do with Age 4, when they're like, hey,

67
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,600
if we made a new Age game, what would we do?

68
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,000
I think that all contributed to us being like, boy, these games are in kind of rough shape.

69
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,240
Can we preserve them better?

70
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,040
Can we do a better job with networking?

71
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,880
I mean, there's some poops people have to jump through right to play them.

72
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,880
Can we make that better?

73
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,360
And, you know, that kind of started the whole conversation towards what Definitive Editions

74
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,360
became.

75
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:24,000
I would say that you start above just over five years ago is when we start doing it.

76
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,840
We kind of like did it in parallel when the Age of Empires 4 project was like being discussed

77
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,840
and then start.

78
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,880
And then we say like, hey, you know what would be awesome is we have a chance to actually

79
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,080
bring all the original Age of Empires back as well.

80
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:46,040
So by the time Age 4 comes out, then everyone already like have the chance to recently would

81
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,480
play all the all the awesome Age of Empires games.

82
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,680
We want to make all the age fans happy.

83
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:56,840
So that's why when we signed the project, we got approval to do all of them.

84
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,720
One was never actually re-released.

85
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:04,840
So when we re-released Definitive Edition, that was the first time that we bring it back.

86
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:10,080
But in terms of production, we did do one first and then go to two and then three started

87
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,600
in parallel as well.

88
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:18,880
So but the idea is like, hey, let's learn how to do real-time strategy games the right

89
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,480
way again.

90
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,680
You could almost say that Age 1 is like the national game of Vietnam.

91
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,880
It's almost like Starcraft is for Korea.

92
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,160
It's crazy, but they only play Age 1.

93
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,520
Like they don't they're not really into Age 2 and then yet Age 2 has surpassed a lot

94
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:41,000
of people because I think it's just how globally accessible it is, right?

95
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,760
It's just like there's there's hey, one of your your nation or a previous nation that

96
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,360
became your nation is in that game somewhere, right?

97
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,600
Every one of them just has such a unique player base and I think that's because each game

98
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,160
kind of has its own rhythm to it and its own pacing and people have fallen in love with

99
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,000
the unique stick of each one.

100
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,680
So it's funny when you say like, well, did one replace the other?

101
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,800
No, they never did.

102
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,400
Yeah, Age of Time has one was special for that reason.

103
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:19,000
You really teach us a lot of foundation work on how to redo all the art, how to like really

104
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,120
build a game across different regions of the world at the same time, get all the like

105
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,920
really, really smart people together that are passionate about Age of Empires to work

106
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,520
together on the projects.

107
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:37,240
We set up a whole studio for Age of Empires, like literally this one, this one we did.

108
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:41,240
We have all these wonderful sister studio partners that work with us, right?

109
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:46,960
Tana, Liz, Forgotten Empires, Relic, just name a few and they all end up working in

110
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,560
different aspects on pretty much every Age of Empires game because they all have such

111
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,720
unique strengths that they all get pulled in at some point.

112
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,000
It's like, it starts, well, it's just going to be Relic and it is for a while and it's

113
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,200
like, Hey, Forgotten Empires, can you come in and help us with some tuning and like, oh,

114
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:06,440
hey, can you do this part of the code over here that we, yeah, it's a big family.

115
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,760
Actually, matter of fact, there's a lot of Command and Conquer people here myself.

116
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:15,680
Yeah, like I was on all the CNC games except for the very first one and there's two others

117
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:20,280
from Westwood as well that are on my team that are on our team that all work on the

118
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,880
game now, which is kind of fun.

119
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:27,520
But we did talk to a lot of X Ensemble people since we have friends and we get to talk to

120
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,520
them.

121
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,400
It was really cool that a lot of them still remember Age of Empires really fondly.

122
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:36,520
So they want us to do well and was pretty helpful.

123
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,600
We actually learned a lot of things from one.

124
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,960
So for one, the project itself, we definitely like try to bring up the quality of life.

125
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:55,000
We added a new user interface so we can actually tell what's going on.

126
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,800
We actually try running the original code as is and the pixels are so big that you can

127
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,680
actually see it anymore.

128
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,920
It is amazing.

129
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,280
But there are just so many conventions that people are so used to.

130
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:12,400
Then we also need to like, Hey, but the fans play Age of Empires one because it is Age

131
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,720
of Empires one.

132
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:18,920
So we want to make sure that we keep the spirit of Age of Empires one, the code to be the

133
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,920
same.

134
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,320
So we ended up using a plan.

135
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,760
We actually updated the engine instead of creating a new engine.

136
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:31,320
We did do some experiment of complete, do a new engine for a little bit.

137
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:36,120
But then really quickly, you find out that they are timing the feel of it.

138
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,560
Keeping the feel is very important to us because that's what the fans want, right?

139
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,880
Man, a lot of people, they had this fondness in their head for what Age one looked like.

140
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:51,040
I actually originally, we wanted to, I had posed the idea of starting every game on the

141
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:56,320
original graphics and then it blur, like I'll pixel and then it blurs into the new version.

142
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,800
But the asset load was so crazy from the new version that we're like, we can't even hold

143
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,200
the memory to have the pixelated versions in there.

144
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,880
The original assets are pretty much unusable for us to go forwards with.

145
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,560
So we had to redo everything from scratch.

146
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:19,840
We're trying to learn where the bar is, like the authenticity bar versus like high-res bar,

147
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,880
like where do you draw the line and we have to learn where that is.

148
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:29,920
But we have learned that from two, from one, that if you get too close to the original,

149
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,320
all the original fans will love it, but it makes it really hard for new people to join.

150
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:52,880
So for two, we set up, one of our goals, we actually write on the whiteboard, they say,

151
00:10:52,880 --> 00:11:00,320
we want to build the Age of Empires 2 you remember, not the reality that you see.

152
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,800
You know, fortunately, given the size of the game and given the zooms, there was certain,

153
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,960
that puts some restrictions on how big they had to be, how detailed they had to be.

154
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:13,400
So it made the modeling a little simpler, but to get to 4K assets, everything had to

155
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:20,160
be redone, all the animations, all of the states, every single sprite rotation that

156
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:25,520
we have to do, creating 3D assets of them because it's just easier to animate them quickly

157
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,600
instead of having to draw all the, because you'd have to do keyframes and then do all

158
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,000
the tweens and like if you're doing classical animation.

159
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,880
So it's just easier to do it in 3D that way to capture all of the animations.

160
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,400
And then one of the challenge, the big challenge was converting the eight facings so they didn't

161
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:46,080
just pop into a blend so that we could have kind of more smooth rotations.

162
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,600
If you go back and you look at the old, a lot of the old RTS games, they've only eight

163
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,880
directions for anything.

164
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,960
So you get things to go mm, mm, right?

165
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:58,680
And we blended them, but we had to maintain the timing of the original because as Ernest

166
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,720
said, feel was so important.

167
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,680
There was a lot of logic and code that went into making sure that, again, we maintained

168
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:08,960
feel even though we could improve the visuals.

169
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:13,760
Like noise is always an issue in RTS games because you want really clean reads, right?

170
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,640
I mean, like if you really think about it, RTS games at their core are three elements.

171
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:21,200
There's units, structures and things that block me, right?

172
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,960
And then the things that block me can be a building, it could be water, it could be,

173
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,120
you know, a hill, whatever.

174
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,720
But like that's really what you need to be able to, a player needs to be able to read

175
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,080
that in seconds, right?

176
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:36,120
And so silhouettes were insanely important to us.

177
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,560
And so that was a challenge, right?

178
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:42,400
Because if you have all this super detail on the units is that if you crush it down directly,

179
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,480
you just get noise.

180
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,560
And then it's hard to read the units.

181
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:49,600
So a lot of care was taken in making sure that things like if they had shields, that

182
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,360
the shield remained relatively clean, even if different resolution scales such that if

183
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,960
that was a key reader, that unit that would maintain, right?

184
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:01,640
And that we had to do that with each kind of unit to make sure that the unit's still

185
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:07,320
read is the units.

186
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:15,160
For voices, for each two, for example, we did record all the voices, many can be voices.

187
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:20,200
So those are the things that we completely record for each of them as two.

188
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:30,840
For authenticity, we wanted to keep as much as we could.

189
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:35,960
If we had good source and could clean it up, we would do that over re-recording.

190
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,960
Right.

191
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:41,520
Yeah, you didn't have anyone shouting walla-la-la into a microphone at this time.

192
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,520
Right.

193
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:47,120
That was from like a sample library.

194
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:52,880
We did re-record walla-la-la, actually, because of that we didn't want to, because there was

195
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:58,640
a time, I think, when people were pretty fast and loose with audio assets in terms of ownership,

196
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,880
and we wanted to make sure that this time around we were doing the DEs, that everything

197
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,760
was buttoned up in that respect.

198
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:08,320
Do you have any idea why that was chosen for that particular unit?

199
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,920
I don't know.

200
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,920
I do not know.

201
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:16,800
I think it was literally something like the name of the audio sample was like priest chant

202
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,160
or something like that, and maybe they just saw it, like, oh, priest chant, maybe that'll

203
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:29,040
work, and they're like, well, okay, let's just do it.

204
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:34,840
Every definitive revision game we reached out to the communities that were holding those

205
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,840
games up.

206
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,720
I mean, a lot of these games were maintained by the community for years and years and years

207
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,040
without us being involved at all.

208
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,380
So we reached out to them, and we're like, hey, we'd love to improve these.

209
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,960
What would you like to see?

210
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,920
We don't want to break the spirit of the game, like, absolutely.

211
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,840
So how can we improve them without breaking them?

212
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,680
Because there's a certain, I think there's a certain amount of things that you would

213
00:14:54,680 --> 00:15:00,120
love to modernize sometimes, but that would not make it age one or age two.

214
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,840
If you're familiar with age two, you know that things like when we put in auto-scouting,

215
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:08,880
how contentious that was for some people, even though then you play it and you're like,

216
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,880
well, okay, I get it.

217
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,880
For new players, it works.

218
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,680
I'm not going to use it as an advanced player.

219
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:17,160
We, some folks remember that, for example, for age two, we actually run multiple betas

220
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:23,280
that were literally like, I think the first time was like tens of thousands of people.

221
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:28,480
And like right before ship, we have like lots of people because we want to stress the server.

222
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,000
We also want to see what people always have an opinion on what they like and what they

223
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
don't like.

224
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,720
Ideally, we do those before the game even comes out.

225
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,280
And of course, we have our internal QA teams, and they know the game very, very well.

226
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:49,360
So for years, real-time strategy developers have tried to make their PC games work on

227
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,120
consoles, and we've had mixed results.

228
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,800
Some of the better examples are games that were developed from the ground up for consoles,

229
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,120
but that wasn't really an option here.

230
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:04,600
Console players wanted to play Age of Empires after all, not some reduced version.

231
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:09,360
And that's what makes the console version of Age of Empires two so interesting.

232
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,480
You see, the various teams working alongside World's Edge made some fairly significant

233
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:17,320
changes to the game to get it to flow properly on consoles.

234
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:21,600
Not just new interface elements to better suit the controller, but full-blown automation

235
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,200
systems to unburden the player from some of the game's micro, especially with how you

236
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,120
assign citizens to collect various resources.

237
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,680
So how did they change so much and still seem to satisfy these players?

238
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:39,680
As your economy grows, you will train more villagers and gather different types of resources.

239
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,360
Villager priorities automatically distribute your villagers between resources, making it

240
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,360
easier to manage your economy.

241
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:57,200
So when we first started being part of the Xbox organization, we did talk about, hey,

242
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:02,040
do we need to do Xbox version as well?

243
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:07,960
Luckily, our boss Shannon Loftis at the time said like, no, concentrate, make the best

244
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,840
PC game that you guys can.

245
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:14,480
And we have space to really focus on the PC version.

246
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,480
And that's what we did.

247
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:20,280
We spent all our resources to make sure we get the best games out possible.

248
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:25,360
So I've made, over the years, I think I've made four console RTSs, starting with Red Alert

249
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,400
on the PlayStation and then going through the years.

250
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:34,120
My previous one was Universal War, right, by Sega put out.

251
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:38,120
So there's been a history of us kind of working on it and trying to think through them.

252
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,720
The big thing is just the fundamental difference of a mouse is a precision instrument.

253
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,840
It's like, I click this thing, I click it over here, I'm making very precisiony kind

254
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:51,720
of movements, right, where a controller is like, I drive, I move a camera, I move a unit,

255
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,240
like I do something direct.

256
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:59,080
It's really hard to make the two of those work together.

257
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:03,880
So we did a lot, a lot of experimentation, I mean, just a ton.

258
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:08,640
And I have to say that Phil Spencer was really like, when am I going to get my console version?

259
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,920
Because Phil loves the Xbox.

260
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:14,800
And so the whole time that we were like, no, we want to do the PC first, and then we'll

261
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,960
think about console, which is what we did.

262
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,840
But he was just like, no, I want, when, when am I going to get this?

263
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,840
And he plays.

264
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,840
You go online right now and you can see him playing a couple of times a week.

265
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,840
It's great.

266
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:36,160
After H2 comes out, I would say every single time we made any announcement of anything

267
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:41,080
we, someone is going to be in the feedback comment session where it's like, when is it

268
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,080
coming to Xbox?

269
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,080
When is it coming to Xbox?

270
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:49,440
Literally, I want to say like two years, like non-stop, that fans are asking for it.

271
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,960
Like I mentioned earlier, our studio principle is to make our fans happy.

272
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,920
At a certain point, we say like, okay, this is not just one of you guys, you really need

273
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,480
to like make this work.

274
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,240
So we started to look at it seriously.

275
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:09,040
The fun part is from a production standpoint, like we internally try to hook up a controller

276
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:14,600
directly to emulate the mouse, because when you ask a programmer how you would do it,

277
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,040
that's exactly what a lot of games have done, right?

278
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:25,480
They look at like, this is the mouse, and A and B, which is like, man, was it bad?

279
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,600
The mouse you can actually move across the screen really quickly.

280
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:33,560
And the way that people play on PC is they click on the screen and then they hockey back

281
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,160
and then click on the game right.

282
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,280
You can't do that with the analog stand.

283
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,080
It is just way too slow.

284
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:45,000
The game example we actually talk about is actually Diablo, because when you look at

285
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,200
like Diablo, it is a very mouse click game, right?

286
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:53,240
So they click a lot, but they transition to console really well.

287
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:57,120
What's the Diablo equivalent for real time strategy game for each of the empires?

288
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,960
That's literally like how we start thinking then, okay, let's make these things feels

289
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,800
really good first.

290
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:09,440
And in order for that pacing to be right, you cannot just do the repetitive pick a guy,

291
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,920
do this pick a guy, this you can, but it is boring.

292
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,160
That is not how people want to interact with the game.

293
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:21,200
So the AI is done in a way to help take a lot of the tedious workout, but we actually make

294
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,320
sure that you get to pick the automation level.

295
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:29,300
So all these strategic decisions are still made by you, the player.

296
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:34,840
So that was very important for us to make sure that it is not like auto everything and

297
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,760
then you don't even have to play the game.

298
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:41,640
But it's auto enough that you can enjoy the game and enjoy making strategic decisions.

299
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,680
So that was the key, key part on how the team actually come together.

300
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:52,720
And once that happened, we had the contest sensitive, sorry, site-based command manual,

301
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,640
then magic happens.

302
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:01,320
Based on my previous work and Tanlist's previous work on doing things like city skylines and

303
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,640
other games that they've done, we're like, okay, we need to put our minds together and

304
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,840
figure out what interface would really work here.

305
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,960
And the radials and all that stuff came out of that, but the thing that really was fascinating

306
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,320
is watching how it evolved.

307
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:19,760
Like the thing that really brought about what I feel is it's really hard to go back, honestly,

308
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,320
even to some of the stuff on PC now from what we've done on console with villager automation

309
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,960
and the contextual actions based on, that was the original conversation.

310
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,440
I'm like, I want contextual actions in here, how do we do it?

311
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,680
All of that, like click on a gold mine, just build the gold mine, please.

312
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:41,280
Like all of that, and it's great to see that people are really enjoying it, but all of

313
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,800
that came about through time.

314
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:48,200
And just, we were really fortunate that we were prototyping console controls.

315
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,640
I mean, probably even before we admitted it, to be honest with you.

316
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:57,360
I think that we were, we've been working on them since right around the ship of, I think

317
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,720
after DE3.

318
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,120
We started messing around with the radials and trying to figure out what to do with it

319
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,680
and how we could do it.

320
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:07,720
We had some people free on one of the teams and we're like, all right, let's just go to

321
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,960
town on this and figure out how to make it work.

322
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,480
I've always said that RTS games are basically, you're spinning plates, right?

323
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,240
You're balancing plates on sticks.

324
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,640
And it's how many plates can you keep going at once and which ones are you letting falter

325
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,520
determines how good of a player you are.

326
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:28,440
So just because the villagers are automated doesn't mean they're optimal.

327
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:34,320
Our goal is never to replace the high-end meta with something that's automated, right?

328
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,720
It should be something that allows people of the same level to be like, we're just going

329
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:41,400
to have fun and I don't need to worry about this as much so I can concentrate on fighting

330
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,480
and scouting and building buildings.

331
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,800
One of the things we always say about the age games is we always want to make sure we

332
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,680
leave room for mastery, that that can have its moments, right?

333
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:55,440
And that people can get good and very good at doing certain things.

334
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,120
And so, but villager automation was one of the things that we thought like, okay, people

335
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:04,720
might be a little upset over it, but it's not going to break the high-end of the game,

336
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,720
right?

337
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,720
The spirit of the game.

338
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:12,920
The villager automation AI and it's actually a lower level AI and debt has evolved over

339
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,680
time completely separately as well.

340
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:22,120
And the reason we get to do a DE AI is because the game has now has been played for two decades

341
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:25,440
now and actually pro players, they play it.

342
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,000
So what we have done is during development of declarative editions, we actually look

343
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,200
at how these pro players, what strategies do they use?

344
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:39,480
And we actually adapt and edit those strategy and bring it to a game, for example, like,

345
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:44,080
hey, it's open field, you build crossbowmen, that we build it into the game so that people

346
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:50,400
actually realize how to, the AI actually have that understanding and apply those strategies

347
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,960
like a pro player would.

348
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:56,120
So that is how we edit it.

349
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:00,360
I have this strict theory about video games that I call the one button of fun.

350
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:04,400
It's like, anytime I should be able to push a button and have some fun, be that, you know,

351
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,640
in a main menu, I want to get into the game, just stop with all the, just one button, let

352
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,640
me just say have fun.

353
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,840
Like, but in the game, you're like, I want, especially RTS games, right?

354
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:17,000
RTS games are all about, if you think about it, a click in an RTS game is insane.

355
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,120
Like with one click, you select a bunch of units, you clicked across the map.

356
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,880
Well, you just did a click, but what did you really see in your mind?

357
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,560
Go here, go this way, go the way I intended you to do.

358
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,760
Make sure you engage or don't engage, right, the things that I want.

359
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,280
Go around that rock this way, don't go over that, make sure you go this, why aren't you

360
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,280
listening to me?

361
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,280
Right?

362
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,200
And all you did was click.

363
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,640
And so, how can we take more of that into the console?

364
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:45,120
And I think that was part of our driving spirit was like, how do we just make it a click,

365
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,120
a button?

366
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,480
Like, do the thing.

367
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,480
Don't make me hunt for it.

368
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,280
Don't maybe dive into a building to get to a thing to do, like Blacksmith to do this

369
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,280
thing.

370
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,280
I can do it right here.

371
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:59,800
That, I think, was our finding like, pull those, bubble it up, I guess, for the console

372
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,520
to make it just much more accessible.

373
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:19,520
It's actually good that we did them one at a time because we would find a feature that

374
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,520
we would love, right?

375
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,520
Or we would experiment and say, oh, let's try putting this in.

376
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,520
And it would be so great.

377
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,880
We're like, well, it has to go in all the DEs now.

378
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,640
And then we'd have to figure out how to move that feature across the games given all the

379
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,600
different engines and the different tech.

380
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,600
But it's been fun.

381
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:42,680
It's been a fun journey of learning and leapfrogging all of those DEs in order to create the package.

382
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,680
It's been great.

383
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:49,240
Just the features, as we leapfrog features, we put Art of War in because I really wanted

384
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:52,160
to help people learn how to play RTS games.

385
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,680
And then we're like, this is so good, it has to go in all the games.

386
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,840
And so then it ended up in three and four.

387
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,800
And now, what's the myth version of Art of War?

388
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,160
Well, we've got to figure that out.

389
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,440
How do we manifest that?

390
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,600
Things like villager automation and context management, do we have that show up now from

391
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,600
now on?

392
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,000
Is that just part of the game?

393
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
We've got to talk about that.

394
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,760
How do we bring that alive if we want to across all the games and what do we do with it?

395
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,000
So it's been great.

396
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,840
A lot of the learnings and everything that we take from every game we're just going to

397
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,800
roll forward with and keep evolving.

398
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:27,520
The English pretensions in Scotland are surely at an end.

399
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,800
The forces of Wallace are triumphant.

400
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:38,800
I think that we, a lot of the sentiment got to people about like, oh, this is long in

401
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,800
the tooth.

402
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:44,080
RTS really did have a heyday and the industry is very cyclical, I guess is the way to put

403
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,080
it.

404
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,920
Where something will come up and come down and come up and come down, there's a time

405
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:51,840
for racers, there's a time for shooters, what the really hot thing is.

406
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:58,080
And I think the great thing is that RTS never really went away completely, but it did wane

407
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,040
in terms of being in the public eye.

408
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:04,760
I think everyone was waiting for someone to take a bet on a big game again, a big RTS

409
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,760
game.

410
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,320
And that's what we did with age four.

411
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:12,880
And now it's honestly, it's kind of delightful to see that we've got what, three splinter

412
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:18,600
companies from Blizzard that are all working on RTS games of different types, right?

413
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,360
Everyone was just waiting for someone to take that like, hey, this can be quality and look,

414
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,040
it can be successful.

415
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:27,040
And then everybody else was ready to dive in.

416
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,040
See?

417
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,400
HFM Pass 2 is now a generation game.

418
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:37,080
So they are literally people who now have their own kids that they try to play with.

419
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:42,080
So we want to make sure you get to someone, maybe, maybe one person play on the console

420
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,480
and the other person play on the PC and they can play with each other.

421
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,960
When we do something, we go all out.

422
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,600
We are very happy with how the games turn out.

423
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:54,960
Hopefully the fans will continue to support us and listen to the fans, so keep telling

424
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,080
us what they like, what they don't like.

425
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:00,920
And we want to keep building each of empires more and more.
