1. **Console Experience Improvement**: The team aimed to streamline RTS gameplay on consoles by making actions more accessible and reducing the need for complex navigation or menu diving. They wanted players to be able to execute commands with a single click, reflecting the intention behind the input as directly as possible.

2. **Feature Integration Across Games**: As features were developed and tested in one game, they were often integrated into all the DEs due to the shared nature of the series. This led to challenges in adapting features across different engines and technologies but also resulted in a consistent and enhanced player experience.

4. **The Resurgence of RTS Games**: The RTS genre had seen better days but remained popular in niche communities. With the success of Age of Empires IV, the industry took notice, and several companies, including splinter groups from Blizzard, began developing their own RTS titles, signaling a resurgence for the genre.

5. **Cross-Platform Play**: The team recognized the importance of allowing players to enjoy the game together, regardless of whether they were on PC or console. They aimed to facilitate cross-platform play so that players could interact with friends across different gaming systems.

6. **Community Feedback and Continuous Improvement**: The developers emphasized the importance of community feedback in shaping the future of the Age of Empires series. They encouraged fans to communicate their preferences and suggestions, assuring them that they are committed to building upon the games and making them even better with each iteration.
