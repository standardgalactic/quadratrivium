0	26280	So, you may not be aware of this, but Age of Empires has had quite the remarkable comeback
26280	28080	over the past few years.
28080	33240	This all started back in 2018 when Microsoft released a full-scale remaster of the original
33240	38940	1997 Age of Empires under the title Age of Empires Definitive Edition.
38940	43840	This was followed one year later with a Definitive Edition of its insanely popular sequel, a
43840	48760	year later with the Definitive Edition of the first 3D game in the series Age of Empires
48760	53320	3, and in an effort to keep the streak up, Microsoft just went ahead and made a new Age
53320	56640	of Empires game and named it Age of Empires 4.
56640	59000	So you're probably thinking what I was thinking, right?
59000	64400	Big company like Microsoft suddenly making a bunch of cheap remakes of this classic series
64400	68960	just to get people interested in it again so they can reboot the franchise.
68960	74000	But here's the thing, every single one of these games has been well received, not just
74000	78640	by the fans, not just by the media, but by the market too.
78640	83520	The past few years have been a full-blown Age of Empires renaissance with active online
83520	88320	communities, terrific age-focused YouTube channels like Spirit of the Law, and even
88320	93000	a vibranese sports scene thanks to the Red Bull Wololo tournament that's been running
93000	97000	since 2000.
97000	101700	The series has been so popular that earlier this year Microsoft released a console version
101700	107880	of Age of Empires 2, a game that seems inconceivable to play without a mouse and keyboard.
107880	112760	So I mean, that's gotta be a cash grab, there's no way people actually enjoyed playing it
112920	114920	on a controller.
114920	119800	So here's the thing, this is a bit of a selfish documentary because myself and my wife played
119800	126120	dozens of hours of Age of Empires 2 Definitive Edition over the past few years, specifically
126120	128320	during the COVID-19 lockdown.
128320	133920	See we were 13 when Age of Empires 2 was originally released on PC, and like most PC gamers back
133920	139160	then I was enthralled by its exciting balance of city building and real-time strategy.
139160	142760	Age of Empires isn't the first real-time strategy game that Honor is usually given
142760	147080	to Westwood's Dune 2, but it was a genre-defining game.
147080	152040	A beautiful, isometric world with a collection of civilizations to choose from, each with
152040	155160	their own language, buildings, and style of warfare.
155160	157280	The battles were exciting, but manageable.
157280	161360	There was a single-player story, but you could also create custom skirmishes with different
161360	164120	rules on a variety of different landmasses.
164120	168920	There were sea battles, there's early artillery, politics, religion.
168920	172320	Age of Empires was basically chess on steroids.
172320	178080	So during the pandemic, when we had to close the previous no-clip studios, I had to bring
178080	182920	all that equipment back to my house, and I suddenly had like four desktop PCs just lying
182920	184080	around my house.
184080	190520	So myself and my wife decided to look for any PC game that we could play cooperatively.
190520	195240	We had both played Age 2 while growing up, so we turned the spare bedroom into basically
195240	196560	a LAN cafe.
196560	201160	And so when our kid went to sleep, we'd burn the quarantine midnight oil, ganging up against
201160	203520	some bots in custom skirmishes.
203520	207960	It became so much of our day today that for Valentine's Day that year, she made me this
207960	208960	card.
208960	213600	Again, sorry, if you're not getting the willow-low thing, don't worry, we'll cover it later.
213600	217800	So today we're going to dive into the resurrection of Age of Empires by talking to two of the
217800	221800	folks at the studio that Microsoft spun up to helm this effort.
221800	227800	Ernest Yon, executive producer at Worlds Edge, and Adam Icegreen, senior creative director
227800	229080	at Worlds Edge.
229080	233040	But before we dive into the nitty-gritty, I wanted to ask them where the decision to
233040	235720	remake the first three games came from.
235720	239800	You see, it's not like you couldn't play Age of Empires until these definitive editions
239800	240800	came out.
240800	246840	An HD remake of AOE 2 had been on Steam since 2013, and a version of Age 3 had been available
246840	248840	on Steam since 07.
248840	253560	Why did they think people wanted these new versions, and why is it they made the decision
253560	265080	to remake all three?
265080	268960	You know, a lot of people in that time were like, oh, Archeist games are dead, right?
268960	273520	They got eaten by MOBAs, they got eaten by Tower of Defense games, your farm bills, whatever,
273520	275520	you know, let this genre split.
275520	280400	And when we put the catalog up, the crazy thing was that we're like, wait, people are
280400	286480	engaging with this, like with long sessions, and more people keep coming to the title.
286480	291960	And we really were like, well, wait, maybe Archeist isn't dead, like, what could we do
291960	293120	here?
293120	297200	And I think that was that plus what we wanted to do with Age 4, when they're like, hey,
297200	299600	if we made a new Age game, what would we do?
299600	304000	I think that all contributed to us being like, boy, these games are in kind of rough shape.
304000	306240	Can we preserve them better?
306240	308040	Can we do a better job with networking?
308040	311880	I mean, there's some poops people have to jump through right to play them.
311880	312880	Can we make that better?
312880	317360	And, you know, that kind of started the whole conversation towards what Definitive Editions
317360	318360	became.
318360	324000	I would say that you start above just over five years ago is when we start doing it.
324000	330840	We kind of like did it in parallel when the Age of Empires 4 project was like being discussed
330840	331840	and then start.
331840	336880	And then we say like, hey, you know what would be awesome is we have a chance to actually
336880	340080	bring all the original Age of Empires back as well.
340080	346040	So by the time Age 4 comes out, then everyone already like have the chance to recently would
346040	348480	play all the all the awesome Age of Empires games.
348480	350680	We want to make all the age fans happy.
350680	356840	So that's why when we signed the project, we got approval to do all of them.
356840	359720	One was never actually re-released.
359720	364840	So when we re-released Definitive Edition, that was the first time that we bring it back.
364840	370080	But in terms of production, we did do one first and then go to two and then three started
370080	371600	in parallel as well.
371600	378880	So but the idea is like, hey, let's learn how to do real-time strategy games the right
378880	380480	way again.
380480	384680	You could almost say that Age 1 is like the national game of Vietnam.
384680	386880	It's almost like Starcraft is for Korea.
387360	390160	It's crazy, but they only play Age 1.
390160	395520	Like they don't they're not really into Age 2 and then yet Age 2 has surpassed a lot
395520	401000	of people because I think it's just how globally accessible it is, right?
401000	405760	It's just like there's there's hey, one of your your nation or a previous nation that
405760	409360	became your nation is in that game somewhere, right?
409360	413600	Every one of them just has such a unique player base and I think that's because each game
413680	418160	kind of has its own rhythm to it and its own pacing and people have fallen in love with
418160	421000	the unique stick of each one.
421000	424680	So it's funny when you say like, well, did one replace the other?
424680	425800	No, they never did.
427960	431400	Yeah, Age of Time has one was special for that reason.
431400	439000	You really teach us a lot of foundation work on how to redo all the art, how to like really
439000	445120	build a game across different regions of the world at the same time, get all the like
445120	449920	really, really smart people together that are passionate about Age of Empires to work
449920	452520	together on the projects.
452520	457240	We set up a whole studio for Age of Empires, like literally this one, this one we did.
457240	461240	We have all these wonderful sister studio partners that work with us, right?
461240	466960	Tana, Liz, Forgotten Empires, Relic, just name a few and they all end up working in
467000	471560	different aspects on pretty much every Age of Empires game because they all have such
471560	475720	unique strengths that they all get pulled in at some point.
475720	479000	It's like, it starts, well, it's just going to be Relic and it is for a while and it's
479000	482200	like, Hey, Forgotten Empires, can you come in and help us with some tuning and like, oh,
482200	486440	hey, can you do this part of the code over here that we, yeah, it's a big family.
486440	489760	Actually, matter of fact, there's a lot of Command and Conquer people here myself.
489760	495680	Yeah, like I was on all the CNC games except for the very first one and there's two others
495720	500280	from Westwood as well that are on my team that are on our team that all work on the
500280	501880	game now, which is kind of fun.
501880	507520	But we did talk to a lot of X Ensemble people since we have friends and we get to talk to
507520	508520	them.
508520	512400	It was really cool that a lot of them still remember Age of Empires really fondly.
512400	516520	So they want us to do well and was pretty helpful.
522720	524600	We actually learned a lot of things from one.
524640	529960	So for one, the project itself, we definitely like try to bring up the quality of life.
529960	535000	We added a new user interface so we can actually tell what's going on.
535000	539800	We actually try running the original code as is and the pixels are so big that you can
539800	541680	actually see it anymore.
541680	543920	It is amazing.
543920	548280	But there are just so many conventions that people are so used to.
548280	552400	Then we also need to like, Hey, but the fans play Age of Empires one because it is Age
552400	553720	of Empires one.
553720	558920	So we want to make sure that we keep the spirit of Age of Empires one, the code to be the
558920	559920	same.
559920	562320	So we ended up using a plan.
562320	566760	We actually updated the engine instead of creating a new engine.
566760	571320	We did do some experiment of complete, do a new engine for a little bit.
571320	576120	But then really quickly, you find out that they are timing the feel of it.
576120	580560	Keeping the feel is very important to us because that's what the fans want, right?
580560	585880	Man, a lot of people, they had this fondness in their head for what Age one looked like.
585880	591040	I actually originally, we wanted to, I had posed the idea of starting every game on the
591040	596320	original graphics and then it blur, like I'll pixel and then it blurs into the new version.
596320	600800	But the asset load was so crazy from the new version that we're like, we can't even hold
600800	604200	the memory to have the pixelated versions in there.
604200	608880	The original assets are pretty much unusable for us to go forwards with.
608880	613560	So we had to redo everything from scratch.
613560	619840	We're trying to learn where the bar is, like the authenticity bar versus like high-res bar,
619840	623880	like where do you draw the line and we have to learn where that is.
623880	629920	But we have learned that from two, from one, that if you get too close to the original,
629920	634320	all the original fans will love it, but it makes it really hard for new people to join.
638880	652880	So for two, we set up, one of our goals, we actually write on the whiteboard, they say,
652880	660320	we want to build the Age of Empires 2 you remember, not the reality that you see.
660320	664800	You know, fortunately, given the size of the game and given the zooms, there was certain,
665280	668960	that puts some restrictions on how big they had to be, how detailed they had to be.
668960	673400	So it made the modeling a little simpler, but to get to 4K assets, everything had to
673400	680160	be redone, all the animations, all of the states, every single sprite rotation that
680160	685520	we have to do, creating 3D assets of them because it's just easier to animate them quickly
685520	688600	instead of having to draw all the, because you'd have to do keyframes and then do all
688600	692000	the tweens and like if you're doing classical animation.
692000	696880	So it's just easier to do it in 3D that way to capture all of the animations.
696880	701400	And then one of the challenge, the big challenge was converting the eight facings so they didn't
701400	706080	just pop into a blend so that we could have kind of more smooth rotations.
706080	709600	If you go back and you look at the old, a lot of the old RTS games, they've only eight
709600	710880	directions for anything.
710880	713960	So you get things to go mm, mm, right?
713960	718680	And we blended them, but we had to maintain the timing of the original because as Ernest
718680	720720	said, feel was so important.
720720	724680	There was a lot of logic and code that went into making sure that, again, we maintained
724680	728960	feel even though we could improve the visuals.
728960	733760	Like noise is always an issue in RTS games because you want really clean reads, right?
733760	737640	I mean, like if you really think about it, RTS games at their core are three elements.
737640	741200	There's units, structures and things that block me, right?
741200	744960	And then the things that block me can be a building, it could be water, it could be,
744960	747120	you know, a hill, whatever.
747120	750720	But like that's really what you need to be able to, a player needs to be able to read
750720	752080	that in seconds, right?
752080	756120	And so silhouettes were insanely important to us.
756120	757560	And so that was a challenge, right?
757560	762400	Because if you have all this super detail on the units is that if you crush it down directly,
762400	763480	you just get noise.
763480	765560	And then it's hard to read the units.
765560	769600	So a lot of care was taken in making sure that things like if they had shields, that
769600	774360	the shield remained relatively clean, even if different resolution scales such that if
774360	777960	that was a key reader, that unit that would maintain, right?
777960	781640	And that we had to do that with each kind of unit to make sure that the unit's still
781640	787320	read is the units.
787320	795160	For voices, for each two, for example, we did record all the voices, many can be voices.
795160	800200	So those are the things that we completely record for each of them as two.
800600	810840	For authenticity, we wanted to keep as much as we could.
810840	815960	If we had good source and could clean it up, we would do that over re-recording.
815960	816960	Right.
816960	821520	Yeah, you didn't have anyone shouting walla-la-la into a microphone at this time.
821520	822520	Right.
822520	827120	That was from like a sample library.
827120	832880	We did re-record walla-la-la, actually, because of that we didn't want to, because there was
832880	838640	a time, I think, when people were pretty fast and loose with audio assets in terms of ownership,
838640	842880	and we wanted to make sure that this time around we were doing the DEs, that everything
842880	844760	was buttoned up in that respect.
844760	848320	Do you have any idea why that was chosen for that particular unit?
848320	849920	I don't know.
849920	850920	I do not know.
850920	856800	I think it was literally something like the name of the audio sample was like priest chant
856800	860160	or something like that, and maybe they just saw it, like, oh, priest chant, maybe that'll
860160	869040	work, and they're like, well, okay, let's just do it.
869040	874840	Every definitive revision game we reached out to the communities that were holding those
874840	875840	games up.
875840	878720	I mean, a lot of these games were maintained by the community for years and years and years
878720	881040	without us being involved at all.
881040	884380	So we reached out to them, and we're like, hey, we'd love to improve these.
884380	885960	What would you like to see?
885960	888920	We don't want to break the spirit of the game, like, absolutely.
888920	891840	So how can we improve them without breaking them?
891840	894680	Because there's a certain, I think there's a certain amount of things that you would
894680	900120	love to modernize sometimes, but that would not make it age one or age two.
900120	903840	If you're familiar with age two, you know that things like when we put in auto-scouting,
903840	908880	how contentious that was for some people, even though then you play it and you're like,
908880	909880	well, okay, I get it.
909880	910880	For new players, it works.
910880	912680	I'm not going to use it as an advanced player.
912680	917160	We, some folks remember that, for example, for age two, we actually run multiple betas
917160	923280	that were literally like, I think the first time was like tens of thousands of people.
923280	928480	And like right before ship, we have like lots of people because we want to stress the server.
928480	933000	We also want to see what people always have an opinion on what they like and what they
933000	934000	don't like.
934000	937720	Ideally, we do those before the game even comes out.
937720	941280	And of course, we have our internal QA teams, and they know the game very, very well.
943680	949360	So for years, real-time strategy developers have tried to make their PC games work on
949360	953120	consoles, and we've had mixed results.
953120	957800	Some of the better examples are games that were developed from the ground up for consoles,
957800	960120	but that wasn't really an option here.
960120	964600	Console players wanted to play Age of Empires after all, not some reduced version.
964600	969360	And that's what makes the console version of Age of Empires two so interesting.
969360	973480	You see, the various teams working alongside World's Edge made some fairly significant
973480	977320	changes to the game to get it to flow properly on consoles.
977320	981600	Not just new interface elements to better suit the controller, but full-blown automation
981600	986200	systems to unburden the player from some of the game's micro, especially with how you
986200	989120	assign citizens to collect various resources.
989120	993680	So how did they change so much and still seem to satisfy these players?
993680	999680	As your economy grows, you will train more villagers and gather different types of resources.
999680	1004360	Villager priorities automatically distribute your villagers between resources, making it
1004360	1006360	easier to manage your economy.
1011360	1017200	So when we first started being part of the Xbox organization, we did talk about, hey,
1017200	1022040	do we need to do Xbox version as well?
1022040	1027960	Luckily, our boss Shannon Loftis at the time said like, no, concentrate, make the best
1027960	1030840	PC game that you guys can.
1030840	1034480	And we have space to really focus on the PC version.
1034480	1035480	And that's what we did.
1035480	1040280	We spent all our resources to make sure we get the best games out possible.
1040280	1045360	So I've made, over the years, I think I've made four console RTSs, starting with Red Alert
1045360	1048400	on the PlayStation and then going through the years.
1048400	1054120	My previous one was Universal War, right, by Sega put out.
1054120	1058120	So there's been a history of us kind of working on it and trying to think through them.
1058120	1061720	The big thing is just the fundamental difference of a mouse is a precision instrument.
1061720	1065840	It's like, I click this thing, I click it over here, I'm making very precisiony kind
1065840	1071720	of movements, right, where a controller is like, I drive, I move a camera, I move a unit,
1071720	1074240	like I do something direct.
1074680	1079080	It's really hard to make the two of those work together.
1079080	1083880	So we did a lot, a lot of experimentation, I mean, just a ton.
1083880	1088640	And I have to say that Phil Spencer was really like, when am I going to get my console version?
1088640	1090920	Because Phil loves the Xbox.
1090920	1094800	And so the whole time that we were like, no, we want to do the PC first, and then we'll
1094800	1096960	think about console, which is what we did.
1096960	1100840	But he was just like, no, I want, when, when am I going to get this?
1100840	1101840	And he plays.
1101840	1104840	You go online right now and you can see him playing a couple of times a week.
1104840	1105840	It's great.
1109840	1116160	After H2 comes out, I would say every single time we made any announcement of anything
1116160	1121080	we, someone is going to be in the feedback comment session where it's like, when is it
1121080	1122080	coming to Xbox?
1122080	1123080	When is it coming to Xbox?
1123080	1129440	Literally, I want to say like two years, like non-stop, that fans are asking for it.
1129440	1132960	Like I mentioned earlier, our studio principle is to make our fans happy.
1132960	1137920	At a certain point, we say like, okay, this is not just one of you guys, you really need
1137920	1140480	to like make this work.
1140480	1144240	So we started to look at it seriously.
1144240	1149040	The fun part is from a production standpoint, like we internally try to hook up a controller
1149040	1154600	directly to emulate the mouse, because when you ask a programmer how you would do it,
1154600	1157040	that's exactly what a lot of games have done, right?
1157040	1165480	They look at like, this is the mouse, and A and B, which is like, man, was it bad?
1165480	1168600	The mouse you can actually move across the screen really quickly.
1168600	1173560	And the way that people play on PC is they click on the screen and then they hockey back
1173560	1175160	and then click on the game right.
1175160	1178280	You can't do that with the analog stand.
1178280	1180080	It is just way too slow.
1180080	1185000	The game example we actually talk about is actually Diablo, because when you look at
1185000	1188200	like Diablo, it is a very mouse click game, right?
1188200	1193240	So they click a lot, but they transition to console really well.
1193240	1197120	What's the Diablo equivalent for real time strategy game for each of the empires?
1197120	1201960	That's literally like how we start thinking then, okay, let's make these things feels
1201960	1203800	really good first.
1203800	1209440	And in order for that pacing to be right, you cannot just do the repetitive pick a guy,
1209440	1211920	do this pick a guy, this you can, but it is boring.
1211920	1215160	That is not how people want to interact with the game.
1215160	1221200	So the AI is done in a way to help take a lot of the tedious workout, but we actually make
1221200	1225320	sure that you get to pick the automation level.
1225320	1229300	So all these strategic decisions are still made by you, the player.
1229300	1234840	So that was very important for us to make sure that it is not like auto everything and
1234840	1236760	then you don't even have to play the game.
1236760	1241640	But it's auto enough that you can enjoy the game and enjoy making strategic decisions.
1241640	1245680	So that was the key, key part on how the team actually come together.
1245680	1252720	And once that happened, we had the contest sensitive, sorry, site-based command manual,
1252720	1255640	then magic happens.
1255640	1261320	Based on my previous work and Tanlist's previous work on doing things like city skylines and
1261320	1264640	other games that they've done, we're like, okay, we need to put our minds together and
1264640	1267840	figure out what interface would really work here.
1267840	1271960	And the radials and all that stuff came out of that, but the thing that really was fascinating
1271960	1274320	is watching how it evolved.
1274320	1279760	Like the thing that really brought about what I feel is it's really hard to go back, honestly,
1279760	1284320	even to some of the stuff on PC now from what we've done on console with villager automation
1284320	1288960	and the contextual actions based on, that was the original conversation.
1288960	1291440	I'm like, I want contextual actions in here, how do we do it?
1291440	1294680	All of that, like click on a gold mine, just build the gold mine, please.
1295680	1301280	Like all of that, and it's great to see that people are really enjoying it, but all of
1301280	1302800	that came about through time.
1302800	1308200	And just, we were really fortunate that we were prototyping console controls.
1308200	1311640	I mean, probably even before we admitted it, to be honest with you.
1311640	1317360	I think that we were, we've been working on them since right around the ship of, I think
1317360	1318720	after DE3.
1318720	1322120	We started messing around with the radials and trying to figure out what to do with it
1322120	1323680	and how we could do it.
1323680	1327720	We had some people free on one of the teams and we're like, all right, let's just go to
1327720	1330960	town on this and figure out how to make it work.
1332960	1336480	I've always said that RTS games are basically, you're spinning plates, right?
1336480	1338240	You're balancing plates on sticks.
1338240	1342640	And it's how many plates can you keep going at once and which ones are you letting falter
1342640	1344520	determines how good of a player you are.
1344520	1348440	So just because the villagers are automated doesn't mean they're optimal.
1348440	1354320	Our goal is never to replace the high-end meta with something that's automated, right?
1354320	1357720	It should be something that allows people of the same level to be like, we're just going
1357720	1361400	to have fun and I don't need to worry about this as much so I can concentrate on fighting
1361400	1365480	and scouting and building buildings.
1365480	1367800	One of the things we always say about the age games is we always want to make sure we
1367800	1371680	leave room for mastery, that that can have its moments, right?
1371680	1375440	And that people can get good and very good at doing certain things.
1375440	1379120	And so, but villager automation was one of the things that we thought like, okay, people
1379120	1384720	might be a little upset over it, but it's not going to break the high-end of the game,
1384720	1385720	right?
1385720	1387720	The spirit of the game.
1387720	1392920	The villager automation AI and it's actually a lower level AI and debt has evolved over
1392920	1395680	time completely separately as well.
1395680	1402120	And the reason we get to do a DE AI is because the game has now has been played for two decades
1402120	1405440	now and actually pro players, they play it.
1405440	1410000	So what we have done is during development of declarative editions, we actually look
1410000	1414200	at how these pro players, what strategies do they use?
1414200	1419480	And we actually adapt and edit those strategy and bring it to a game, for example, like,
1419480	1424080	hey, it's open field, you build crossbowmen, that we build it into the game so that people
1424080	1430400	actually realize how to, the AI actually have that understanding and apply those strategies
1430400	1431960	like a pro player would.
1431960	1436120	So that is how we edit it.
1436120	1440360	I have this strict theory about video games that I call the one button of fun.
1440360	1444400	It's like, anytime I should be able to push a button and have some fun, be that, you know,
1444400	1447640	in a main menu, I want to get into the game, just stop with all the, just one button, let
1447640	1448640	me just say have fun.
1448640	1451840	Like, but in the game, you're like, I want, especially RTS games, right?
1451840	1457000	RTS games are all about, if you think about it, a click in an RTS game is insane.
1457000	1460120	Like with one click, you select a bunch of units, you clicked across the map.
1460400	1463880	Well, you just did a click, but what did you really see in your mind?
1463880	1466560	Go here, go this way, go the way I intended you to do.
1466560	1469760	Make sure you engage or don't engage, right, the things that I want.
1469760	1473280	Go around that rock this way, don't go over that, make sure you go this, why aren't you
1473280	1474280	listening to me?
1474280	1475280	Right?
1475280	1477200	And all you did was click.
1477200	1481640	And so, how can we take more of that into the console?
1481640	1485120	And I think that was part of our driving spirit was like, how do we just make it a click,
1485120	1486120	a button?
1486120	1487480	Like, do the thing.
1487480	1488480	Don't make me hunt for it.
1488480	1492280	Don't maybe dive into a building to get to a thing to do, like Blacksmith to do this
1492280	1493280	thing.
1493280	1494280	I can do it right here.
1494280	1499800	That, I think, was our finding like, pull those, bubble it up, I guess, for the console
1499800	1501520	to make it just much more accessible.
1501520	1519520	It's actually good that we did them one at a time because we would find a feature that
1519520	1520520	we would love, right?
1520520	1523520	Or we would experiment and say, oh, let's try putting this in.
1523520	1524520	And it would be so great.
1524520	1526880	We're like, well, it has to go in all the DEs now.
1526880	1530640	And then we'd have to figure out how to move that feature across the games given all the
1530640	1533600	different engines and the different tech.
1533600	1534600	But it's been fun.
1534600	1542680	It's been a fun journey of learning and leapfrogging all of those DEs in order to create the package.
1542680	1543680	It's been great.
1543680	1549240	Just the features, as we leapfrog features, we put Art of War in because I really wanted
1549240	1552160	to help people learn how to play RTS games.
1552160	1554680	And then we're like, this is so good, it has to go in all the games.
1554680	1556840	And so then it ended up in three and four.
1556840	1558800	And now, what's the myth version of Art of War?
1558800	1561160	Well, we've got to figure that out.
1561160	1563440	How do we manifest that?
1563440	1567600	Things like villager automation and context management, do we have that show up now from
1567600	1568600	now on?
1568600	1570000	Is that just part of the game?
1570000	1572000	We've got to talk about that.
1572000	1576760	How do we bring that alive if we want to across all the games and what do we do with it?
1576760	1578000	So it's been great.
1578000	1580840	A lot of the learnings and everything that we take from every game we're just going to
1580840	1583800	roll forward with and keep evolving.
1583800	1587520	The English pretensions in Scotland are surely at an end.
1587520	1589800	The forces of Wallace are triumphant.
1589800	1598800	I think that we, a lot of the sentiment got to people about like, oh, this is long in
1598800	1599800	the tooth.
1599800	1604080	RTS really did have a heyday and the industry is very cyclical, I guess is the way to put
1604080	1605080	it.
1605080	1606920	Where something will come up and come down and come up and come down, there's a time
1606920	1611840	for racers, there's a time for shooters, what the really hot thing is.
1611840	1618080	And I think the great thing is that RTS never really went away completely, but it did wane
1618080	1620040	in terms of being in the public eye.
1620040	1624760	I think everyone was waiting for someone to take a bet on a big game again, a big RTS
1624760	1625760	game.
1625760	1627320	And that's what we did with age four.
1627320	1632880	And now it's honestly, it's kind of delightful to see that we've got what, three splinter
1632880	1638600	companies from Blizzard that are all working on RTS games of different types, right?
1638600	1642360	Everyone was just waiting for someone to take that like, hey, this can be quality and look,
1642360	1644040	it can be successful.
1644040	1647040	And then everybody else was ready to dive in.
1647040	1648040	See?
1648040	1650400	HFM Pass 2 is now a generation game.
1650400	1657080	So they are literally people who now have their own kids that they try to play with.
1657080	1662080	So we want to make sure you get to someone, maybe, maybe one person play on the console
1662080	1665480	and the other person play on the PC and they can play with each other.
1665480	1667960	When we do something, we go all out.
1667960	1670600	We are very happy with how the games turn out.
1670600	1674960	Hopefully the fans will continue to support us and listen to the fans, so keep telling
1674960	1677080	us what they like, what they don't like.
1677080	1680920	And we want to keep building each of empires more and more.
