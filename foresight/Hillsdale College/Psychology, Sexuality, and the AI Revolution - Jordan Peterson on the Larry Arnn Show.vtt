00:00.000 --> 00:04.280
Welcome to the Larry Arn Show on the Hillsdale College podcast network.

00:04.280 --> 00:09.360
I would be Larry Arn, President of Hillsdale College, and I have a great and mighty guest

00:09.360 --> 00:10.360
today.

00:10.360 --> 00:11.760
His name is Jordan Peterson.

00:11.760 --> 00:19.400
Jordan Peterson is a psychologist and an academic, and he's had two careers, I think

00:19.400 --> 00:21.120
it's fair to say.

00:21.120 --> 00:27.160
In one, he taught some at Harvard and whatever he taught later for a long time at University

00:27.160 --> 00:28.600
of Toronto.

00:28.600 --> 00:33.440
And wherever he taught, he leaves a trail behind him of students who love him.

00:33.440 --> 00:37.240
And they testified what it is about him that they love, and you're going to see it for

00:37.240 --> 00:39.160
yourself in a few minutes.

00:39.160 --> 00:43.200
In his second career, it starts when a few years ago, he took stand about something,

00:43.200 --> 00:52.320
which was a law in Canada that would require people change all kinds of things that defy

00:52.320 --> 00:55.240
everything ordinary, gender stuff, mostly.

00:55.240 --> 01:01.160
And he stood up against that, and of course, a firestorm came, and he didn't retreat

01:01.160 --> 01:02.160
into any hole.

01:02.160 --> 01:04.820
He'd never been any good at being in a hole.

01:04.820 --> 01:06.920
He decided to go public.

01:06.920 --> 01:12.520
And what I like about, I admire him very much and know him well, I'm privileged that way,

01:12.520 --> 01:17.880
is that his public career follows the same pattern as his academic career.

01:17.880 --> 01:24.360
He's a teacher, and he's relentless, and he's curious, and he knows a lot of stuff.

01:24.480 --> 01:28.720
And he teaches people, and they are grateful, except for the ones who don't want teaching

01:28.720 --> 01:33.360
to happen, and they are enraged, and he's courageous in the face of that.

01:33.360 --> 01:35.480
Welcome, Jordan Peterson.

01:35.480 --> 01:36.560
Thank you, sir.

01:36.560 --> 01:41.120
Because you're a teacher, and because I'm curious about it, I want to talk about psychology,

01:41.120 --> 01:43.240
about what it is.

01:43.240 --> 01:48.600
And I know that you like Carl Jung, and because of that, I never did without knowing much

01:48.600 --> 01:49.600
about him.

01:49.600 --> 01:54.160
I've been reading up on him some, and I want you to explain the general thing.

01:54.160 --> 01:59.880
What is the discipline of psychology, and then something about him, if you care to say?

01:59.880 --> 02:04.920
Well, we all exist at multiple levels simultaneously.

02:04.920 --> 02:12.360
We exist at subatomic level, and the atomic level, and the molecular level, and the level

02:12.360 --> 02:18.960
of organs, and the level of our body, and we have motivational systems, and emotional

02:19.000 --> 02:28.000
systems, and cognitive systems, and perceptual systems, and psychology is the study of the

02:28.000 --> 02:34.680
integration of all of those subordinate levels into the individual.

02:34.680 --> 02:39.400
So you can study all those levels, right up to the level of the individual, and you're

02:39.400 --> 02:44.480
in the domain of psychology, and so I like that integrative function of psychology.

02:44.480 --> 02:51.760
And so when I was in graduate school in particular, the PhD work I did was really quite biological.

02:51.760 --> 02:57.640
I was looking at the genetic, the psychological manifestations of the genetic predisposition

02:57.640 --> 03:04.880
to alcoholism and antisocial behavior, and alcohol is a pharmacological agent, and it

03:04.880 --> 03:08.720
spreads through the brain like water, because it crosses the blood-brain barrier, it's one

03:08.720 --> 03:11.000
of the few chemicals that can do that.

03:11.000 --> 03:16.920
And so to study alcohol's effect on psychology, you have to study alcohol's effect on the

03:16.920 --> 03:22.520
brain, but it affects every bit of the brain, and every bit of the brain is quite a lot

03:22.520 --> 03:23.520
to study.

03:23.520 --> 03:30.240
And so as I was studying alcoholism and the predisposition to alcoholism, I was simultaneously

03:30.240 --> 03:35.360
studying how the brain works to understand how alcohol and other drugs changed its function.

03:35.360 --> 03:40.840
And that got me deep into the study of neuroscience, and affect of neuroscience in particular

03:40.840 --> 03:43.680
that's the neuroscience of emotion and motivation.

03:43.680 --> 03:48.560
And that was a burgeoning field at the time, and I read some of the great early classic

03:48.560 --> 03:54.600
works in that field, and at the same time I was reading a lot of work on the clinical

03:54.600 --> 03:59.360
front, great clinicians, including the people you mentioned, Freud and Jung, and I was integrating

03:59.360 --> 04:03.480
across those, which was something that hadn't been done.

04:03.480 --> 04:09.160
And my first book, Maps of Meaning, was an attempt to integrate across all those levels

04:09.160 --> 04:14.320
from the biological to the narrative, that's a good way of thinking about it.

04:14.320 --> 04:18.480
Jung, do you call yourself a Jungian?

04:18.480 --> 04:20.200
To some degree, yes.

04:20.200 --> 04:23.520
I don't describe myself that way, but it's definitely the case.

04:23.520 --> 04:32.400
I mean, I started reading Freud before I read Jung, and I liked Freud a lot for a variety

04:32.400 --> 04:35.000
of reasons.

04:35.000 --> 04:40.320
So we could go back to Nietzsche to explain this more properly.

04:40.320 --> 04:45.000
So Nietzsche, back in the late 1800s, announced that God was dead.

04:45.000 --> 04:52.320
And what he meant by that, essentially, was that the unity of conception that had brought

04:52.320 --> 04:57.160
us together psychologically and socially was disintegrating.

04:57.160 --> 05:00.200
And Nietzsche knew what the consequence of that would be.

05:00.200 --> 05:05.360
He knew that the consequence of that would be nihilism and hopelessness on the one hand

05:05.360 --> 05:09.200
and a turn towards totalitarian certainties on the other.

05:09.200 --> 05:10.200
He nailed that.

05:10.200 --> 05:12.400
Dostoevsky knew the same thing.

05:12.400 --> 05:16.800
And Nietzsche saw a way out, he thought, and his way out was that human beings would have

05:16.800 --> 05:22.520
to become, they would have to adopt the mien of what they had deposed.

05:22.520 --> 05:27.800
And so he thought that people would have to become gods in some way, and that we could

05:27.800 --> 05:32.440
do that by creating our own values, that we would have to take it upon ourselves to

05:32.440 --> 05:36.320
create our own values, since they were no longer handed down on high from some transcendent

05:36.320 --> 05:37.480
source.

05:37.480 --> 05:43.240
And all of the arguments that Nietzsche laid out were very powerful, including that one.

05:43.240 --> 05:50.440
But reading Freud helped me understand why Nietzsche was wrong, because Freud noted more

05:50.440 --> 05:55.240
clearly than anyone else, at least at that time, that we were not the masters in our

05:55.240 --> 06:02.880
own houses, and that the notion that we could produce our own values was predicated on an

06:02.880 --> 06:09.520
assumption that in some manner we were intrinsically unitary masters of our own destiny, our own

06:09.520 --> 06:12.440
cognition, our own perceptions, our own emotional states.

06:12.440 --> 06:14.400
And Freud really flipped that on its head.

06:14.400 --> 06:19.600
He said, no, we're more like a haunted house full of autonomous spirits.

06:19.600 --> 06:25.000
And those spirits have, those would be complexes in the psychoanalytic term, and those complexes,

06:25.000 --> 06:31.520
those autonomous spirits, some of which are motivational forces, let's say, or emotional

06:31.520 --> 06:32.760
systems.

06:32.760 --> 06:37.440
They have an autonomy and a will that can easily supersede our own.

06:37.440 --> 06:42.560
And so it isn't obvious at all that because we're masters of, not masters in our own

06:42.560 --> 06:46.360
house, that we can in any way create our own values.

06:46.360 --> 06:56.320
And Freud, I think the weakness of Freud, was that he pronounced one motivational system

06:56.320 --> 06:58.440
superordinate sex.

06:58.440 --> 07:06.760
And you could say with some real truth that Freud replaced the god of his ancestors, Yahweh.

07:06.760 --> 07:07.760
Freud was Jewish.

07:07.760 --> 07:14.840
He replaced the god of his ancestors with sexuality and put that at the pinnacle of

07:14.840 --> 07:17.600
the human psychological hierarchy.

07:17.600 --> 07:23.760
And Jung, who was a student of Freud's, although also a student of Nietzsche's, and perhaps

07:23.760 --> 07:26.520
more deeply a student of Nietzsche's, objected to that.

07:26.520 --> 07:35.280
He did not believe that it was appropriate to make the presumption that sex ruled overall.

07:35.280 --> 07:40.640
And I read a lot of Jung, especially when I was in graduate school, I think he had,

07:40.640 --> 07:43.200
I think there's 20 volumes in his collected work, something like that.

07:43.200 --> 07:44.840
I read every single one of them.

07:44.840 --> 07:46.720
And I didn't just read them.

07:46.720 --> 07:49.160
I actually understood them, and that took a lot of work.

07:49.160 --> 07:53.040
I read Archetypes of the Collective Unconscious, it was the first book by Jung I wrote.

07:53.040 --> 07:58.160
I read, little Freudian slip there.

07:58.160 --> 08:01.840
I read it three times before I knew what the hell he was talking about.

08:01.840 --> 08:06.760
Because what Jung is talking about is so strange that it's almost impenetrable.

08:06.760 --> 08:09.360
And then when you do penetrate it, it's terrifying.

08:09.360 --> 08:11.280
That's why psychologists don't like Jung.

08:11.280 --> 08:13.000
That's why people in general don't.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.720
It's like, he's very hard to understand.

08:14.720 --> 08:17.760
Then when you do understand him, he's very, very terrifying.

08:17.760 --> 08:23.120
Because Freud made the case that we were haunted by ghosts, and Jung made the case that we

08:23.120 --> 08:27.120
were haunted by demons and gods, and that's much more accurate.

08:27.120 --> 08:30.120
And when you start to understand that, man, the world is not the same.

08:30.120 --> 08:32.600
It is seriously not the same.

08:32.600 --> 08:38.400
So we're going to talk about sex today, because that's all over the place.

08:38.400 --> 08:46.000
What are estrangement from and fascination with sex today have to do with Freud?

08:46.000 --> 08:53.360
It has to do with what Freud observed, and Freud was correct in that sex is a dominating

08:53.360 --> 08:54.360
force.

08:54.360 --> 08:59.960
Nietzsche said, every drive attempts to philosophize in its spirit, brilliant, brilliant aphorism.

08:59.960 --> 09:01.160
He was really something.

09:01.440 --> 09:09.080
When the world collapses into materialist atheism, let's say, it's highly likely that

09:09.080 --> 09:14.520
sex will arise as the dominant goddess, likely goddess.

09:14.520 --> 09:19.440
It's likely on the feminine side more accurately, if you think about it historically.

09:19.440 --> 09:22.840
Now did Freud bring that about?

09:22.840 --> 09:30.320
Partly because Freud made the case that there was no metaphysical reality, let's say.

09:30.320 --> 09:35.040
There were biological realities, and that the prime biological reality was that of sex.

09:35.040 --> 09:40.720
And so he laid some of the groundwork for those metaphysical claims.

09:40.720 --> 09:49.840
But Freud, to speak in Freud's defense, even though he believed that sex was a dominating

09:49.840 --> 09:54.480
force, it isn't clear at all that he believed that it should be.

09:54.480 --> 09:59.640
Now if you pushed Freud, and what he thought should be at the pinnacle of the moral hierarchy,

10:00.400 --> 10:04.600
he would say something like, the ability to work and play.

10:04.600 --> 10:06.680
And that's not bad.

10:06.680 --> 10:08.080
That's not too bad.

10:08.080 --> 10:12.160
And he had a wisdom, and Freud was also a very practical clinician.

10:12.160 --> 10:19.760
But he also viewed, see, Freud was deeply anti-religious in the Enlightenment tradition.

10:19.760 --> 10:26.960
And he told Jung at one point that it was necessary to make of the doctrine of sexual

10:26.960 --> 10:32.440
motivation an unshakable bulwark against a black tide of occultism.

10:32.440 --> 10:37.840
And it's an interesting phrase because there was a black tide of occultism coming, and

10:37.840 --> 10:41.280
we've certainly seen that unfold over the course of the 20th century.

10:41.280 --> 10:50.720
But it also highlights one of Freud's metaphysical weaknesses, and it was the weakness that separated

10:50.720 --> 10:52.760
Jung from Freud.

10:52.760 --> 11:01.640
And that was that Freud's materialist, deterministic atheism made him incapable of contending with

11:01.640 --> 11:09.200
the realities of the religious world properly, and that undermined his, what would you say,

11:09.200 --> 11:13.840
his ability to sit at the proper pinnacle of the psychoanalytic hierarchy.

11:13.840 --> 11:20.120
So Jung believed, like Jung believed that he had a conception that he put forward as

11:20.120 --> 11:27.760
the self, and the self is you, is the four dimensional you.

11:27.760 --> 11:29.280
And so why four dimensions?

11:29.280 --> 11:37.040
Well, because here you are now in this room at this time, but you are something that extends

11:37.040 --> 11:45.240
across time from birth till death, and the totality of you is that entire being is stretched

11:45.240 --> 11:46.920
across time.

11:46.920 --> 11:51.160
And Jung's self is the four dimensional totality of the person.

11:51.160 --> 11:56.200
Jung was a very sophisticated thinker, and he believed that Christ was a symbol of the

11:56.200 --> 11:57.200
self.

11:57.200 --> 12:03.320
Now, what Jung believed religiously, that's a very difficult thing to put your finger

12:03.320 --> 12:07.360
on because he was a very sophisticated thinker.

12:07.360 --> 12:14.160
I would put him firmly in the Christian camp, but he's not a normal Christian by any stretch

12:14.160 --> 12:16.640
of the imagination.

12:16.640 --> 12:21.760
When he says something like Christ is a symbol of the self, he meant something very deep.

12:21.760 --> 12:30.120
He meant that, well, he meant, for example, that at the highest level of conceptualization,

12:30.120 --> 12:37.080
the human being is something doomed to suffer through death and hell and to emerge reborn.

12:37.080 --> 12:42.080
And he really believed that, and not in the way that you believe something preposterous

12:42.360 --> 12:47.800
because it's an element of faith, but because he saw that as the deepest form of wisdom,

12:47.800 --> 12:51.200
and he also saw it as something that was inevitably true.

12:51.200 --> 12:53.000
The soul is by nature Christian.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.600
That was certainly something Jung believed.

12:55.600 --> 13:01.720
Now let's try to relate that, because something amazing is going on in the world.

13:01.720 --> 13:07.120
We are trying to transform ourselves into whatever we want to be, sexual and everything

13:07.120 --> 13:08.120
else.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.920
And you've taken a stand against that.

13:09.920 --> 13:17.040
I'd like you to apply, and also, what in psychology has led you to do that?

13:17.040 --> 13:24.160
When you say, so, there's a battle right now going on in our culture about self-definition.

13:24.160 --> 13:29.320
I am whatever I say I am, which is, by the way, what God said to Moses when he proclaimed

13:29.320 --> 13:35.440
his identity, and that's not a trivial comment on what's happening now.

13:35.440 --> 13:39.280
Jung believed that the logical conclusion of Protestantism was that everyone would become

13:39.280 --> 13:42.320
their own church.

13:42.320 --> 13:47.640
When Jung said something, he meant it, like all the way down, and so the logical conclusion

13:47.640 --> 13:52.280
of you being your own church is that you're your own God, and that you get to define yourself.

13:52.280 --> 13:57.520
And you might say, well, why can't I define myself, and the right answer is, what the

13:57.520 --> 14:00.280
hell do you know about who you are?

14:00.280 --> 14:04.600
And you think that there's something in you that's yourself that's defining you, but

14:04.600 --> 14:08.520
how do you know you're not just a pawn of that thing you think is yourself?

14:08.520 --> 14:13.680
And so the fatal weakness on the self-definition front is, oh, I see, you're gripped so firmly

14:13.680 --> 14:19.760
by your sexuality that your sexuality now proclaims that it's you, and you believe that.

14:19.760 --> 14:20.960
And you think that's you.

14:20.960 --> 14:27.400
You don't think that you're worshiping a polytheistic pagan goddess, or that she's got you in her

14:27.400 --> 14:28.400
grip.

14:28.400 --> 14:34.080
You think that's you because you have an intrinsic theory of yourself, and your theory of yourself

14:34.080 --> 14:38.760
is whatever you want hedonistically in this moment rules, everyone, including you, and

14:38.760 --> 14:39.880
that's right.

14:39.880 --> 14:43.600
And that everyone who opposes that is nothing but a demon, essentially.

14:43.600 --> 14:48.960
And that means everybody who opposes that doesn't get the same favor.

14:48.960 --> 14:51.440
They can't define themselves the way they want.

14:51.440 --> 14:56.240
Well, that's the incoherence problem, but the radical types, the narcissistic radical

14:56.240 --> 14:59.480
types, they don't give a damn about incoherence because what they give a damn about is that

14:59.480 --> 15:01.880
they get to do exactly what the hell they want.

15:01.880 --> 15:04.880
With whoever they want this moment.

15:04.880 --> 15:05.880
And if that's...

15:05.880 --> 15:11.040
Now, this is where the rubber meets the road, you might say, well, what's the problem with

15:11.040 --> 15:12.040
that?

15:12.040 --> 15:15.840
It's like, why can't I just do whatever the hell I want whenever the hell I want to do

15:15.840 --> 15:17.920
it with whoever I want to do it with?

15:17.920 --> 15:23.080
And the answer is, because everything goes to hell if you do that, including you.

15:23.080 --> 15:24.520
And you say, well, I don't believe in hell.

15:24.520 --> 15:30.000
And I say, well, keep acting the way you are, and you will, right?

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
For sure.

15:31.120 --> 15:35.720
One with an ounce of sense, an iota of sense, and this is actually what defines sense knows

15:35.720 --> 15:37.240
perfectly well.

15:37.240 --> 15:42.240
If they only do exactly what they want to do in accordance with the whim of the moment,

15:42.240 --> 15:44.080
which then becomes their God, right?

15:44.080 --> 15:48.500
Because if you're motivated by the whim of the moment and you place that above all else,

15:48.500 --> 15:49.760
that is now your God.

15:49.760 --> 15:50.960
Well, what's the God?

15:50.960 --> 15:53.280
Well, in this case, let's say it's sexual motivation.

15:53.280 --> 15:58.180
Well, if sexual motivation is your God, you will end up in something indistinguishable

15:58.180 --> 16:03.540
from hell because you will, you will misuse other people, you will make them objects of

16:03.540 --> 16:09.540
your own narrow and immediate desire, and you'll have no relationships.

16:09.540 --> 16:12.420
You'll exploit everyone, including yourself.

16:12.420 --> 16:14.460
And there's that's no way to live.

16:14.460 --> 16:15.900
Well, why is that no way to live?

16:15.900 --> 16:16.900
You're just moralizing.

16:16.900 --> 16:20.860
It's like, no, live like that for two years and find out what happens.

16:20.860 --> 16:25.460
No one with any sense will want to be within 20 feet of you.

16:25.460 --> 16:29.940
And that's because you'll do nothing but exploit, including, and the thing you'll exploit will

16:29.940 --> 16:36.260
include that higher self whose existence you don't, you don't even imagine, right?

16:36.260 --> 16:41.100
Because you've already subjugated yourself to the immediacy of your idiot whim.

16:41.100 --> 16:45.140
And the people who identify themselves on sexual grounds do that all the time.

16:45.140 --> 16:48.580
My paramount feature is who I'm sexually attracted to.

16:48.580 --> 16:50.340
It's really, that's your paramount feature.

16:50.340 --> 16:51.340
Is it?

16:51.340 --> 16:53.060
That's your definition of your intrinsic self.

16:53.060 --> 16:58.340
To call you primitive is an insult to primitive people.

16:58.340 --> 17:05.500
If so, I want to suggest what's been swept away by all this.

17:05.500 --> 17:11.100
In the classic philosophy, in most philosophies since then, the idea was we have a nature.

17:11.100 --> 17:12.700
Everything has a nature.

17:12.700 --> 17:17.820
And the nature and our happiness and well-being depends upon fulfilling our nature.

17:17.820 --> 17:21.700
My little bit of reading of Young suggested he thought roughly like that.

17:21.700 --> 17:25.940
In other words, if he was going to give somebody therapy, he tried to help him become a better

17:25.940 --> 17:28.300
person like a person would be.

17:28.300 --> 17:33.220
Well, that word nature is interesting because it comes from a Latin word that means birth.

17:33.220 --> 17:37.140
It means the process of beginning and growth by which we come to be.

17:37.140 --> 17:44.380
Well, if you lose your nature, then you have no purpose outside your own will.

17:44.380 --> 17:51.260
And now my question, you've been particularly helpful and popular with men, young men especially.

17:51.820 --> 17:53.820
Why is that, do you think?

17:53.820 --> 17:58.740
Well, you can't lose your nature exactly.

17:58.740 --> 18:03.460
You can lose your higher order, integrated, purpose-driven nature.

18:03.460 --> 18:09.700
Here's some natures you won't lose, pain, anxiety.

18:09.700 --> 18:16.500
You can lose your higher nature all you want and all of the negative elements of your nature

18:16.500 --> 18:18.220
will predominate.

18:18.220 --> 18:21.900
And you're not going to rationalize yourself out of pain and anxiety.

18:21.900 --> 18:25.580
This is the thing about those who believe life has no meaning.

18:25.580 --> 18:31.100
It's like, I see, so you think you can argue yourself out of your pain because pain is

18:31.100 --> 18:32.100
a meaning.

18:32.100 --> 18:35.260
Now, you might say, well, it's not a meaning I want to pursue.

18:35.260 --> 18:37.700
What does that have to do with anything?

18:37.700 --> 18:40.140
Pain is an undeniable reality.

18:40.140 --> 18:47.580
Well, if you allow your higher order self to disintegrate, you disintegrate into a landscape

18:47.580 --> 18:51.340
characterized by pain, anxiety, and hopelessness.

18:51.340 --> 18:54.820
That's the metaphysical desert, by the way.

18:54.820 --> 19:04.380
That's the place you end up devolving into when your tyrannical presuppositions are disintegrate,

19:04.380 --> 19:09.340
which is why people cling to their tyrannical presuppositions because there's a mystery.

19:09.340 --> 19:14.300
Well, you don't want to end up in the landscape of pain, anxiety, and hopelessness.

19:14.300 --> 19:19.900
And I actually mean that technically because what happens when you lose direction, the

19:19.900 --> 19:25.140
biological systems that mediate negative emotion signal loss of direction.

19:25.140 --> 19:26.140
That's what anxiety is.

19:26.140 --> 19:27.940
It's a signal of loss of direction.

19:27.940 --> 19:30.900
So if you lose higher order direction, you become anxious.

19:30.900 --> 19:35.260
Well, and you can argue with anxiety, all you want with your atheistic nihilism, but

19:35.260 --> 19:38.340
it isn't going to go away and neither is your pain.

19:38.340 --> 19:43.620
And so one of the things I've told my audiences is, you have to be a fool if you doubt the

19:43.620 --> 19:47.860
reality of pain and anxiety, pain and terror, let's say.

19:47.860 --> 19:48.860
Are they real?

19:48.860 --> 19:52.540
It's like, well, of course, that's an ontological argument.

19:52.540 --> 19:55.940
They're real enough so you'll act like they're real if they come knocking.

19:55.940 --> 20:01.820
So maybe we can satisfy ourselves with that proclamation.

20:01.820 --> 20:05.740
And you say, well, are they the ultimate reality, pain and suffering?

20:05.740 --> 20:07.240
And that's a good question.

20:07.240 --> 20:08.240
That's a tough question.

20:08.240 --> 20:16.040
And I would say, no, the things that transcend pain and suffering are more real than pain

20:16.040 --> 20:17.040
and suffering.

20:17.040 --> 20:20.340
Well, what transcends suffering?

20:20.340 --> 20:29.200
The eternal verities transcend suffering and the higher order nature of man is the antidote

20:29.200 --> 20:31.200
to catastrophic suffering.

20:31.200 --> 20:32.680
It's the antithesis of hell.

20:32.680 --> 20:34.080
Well, what is that?

20:34.080 --> 20:35.080
Is that real?

20:35.080 --> 20:39.720
Well, if pain and suffering are real, and if you can transcend them through allegiance

20:39.720 --> 20:44.280
with a higher order self, well, then the higher order self is obviously not only real, but

20:44.280 --> 20:45.280
more real.

20:45.280 --> 20:46.480
Well, what is that?

20:46.480 --> 20:50.280
Well, this is why Jung said Christ was a symbol of the self.

20:50.280 --> 20:53.800
How do you transcend the eternal realm of suffering?

20:53.800 --> 20:55.120
How do you escape from hell?

20:55.120 --> 20:57.020
It's the same question.

20:57.020 --> 21:00.800
How about voluntary self-sacrifice?

21:00.800 --> 21:01.800
How about that?

21:02.520 --> 21:05.600
Well, that's absolutely no different than the image of the crucifix.

21:05.600 --> 21:07.160
Those are the same thing.

21:07.160 --> 21:13.560
Well, why does the spirit of voluntary self-sacrifice protect you against suffering?

21:13.560 --> 21:21.200
Well, I need to sacrifice my idiot whims in the moment to serve that element of me that

21:21.200 --> 21:23.600
is continuous across time.

21:23.600 --> 21:28.440
This is like Kant's categorical imperative in some ways.

21:28.440 --> 21:36.320
If I'm wise and mature, then I don't make decisions now that will cost me tomorrow or

21:36.320 --> 21:40.120
next week or next month or next year or five years down the road.

21:40.120 --> 21:46.560
I contemplate my extended self, which is like a community across time, and I bind my decisions

21:46.560 --> 21:50.920
in the present by my covenant with my future self.

21:50.920 --> 21:53.000
And there's no difference between doing that.

21:53.000 --> 22:00.680
That means I sacrifice my the whims of the moment to the optimization of the medium and

22:00.680 --> 22:01.960
long run.

22:01.960 --> 22:04.080
And I do the same thing in relationship to other people.

22:04.080 --> 22:05.080
Those are the same thing.

22:05.080 --> 22:06.440
There is no difference.

22:06.440 --> 22:09.040
This is a gospel equation in some ways.

22:09.040 --> 22:12.880
There is no difference between treating you properly and treating myself properly.

22:12.880 --> 22:16.920
And that's because in the final analysis, there's actually no difference between you

22:16.920 --> 22:19.960
and me, not fundamentally.

22:19.960 --> 22:26.200
The classic American account for most of our history is that's because we're the same kind

22:26.200 --> 22:27.200
of thing.

22:27.200 --> 22:30.400
We're equal in what way are we equal?

22:30.400 --> 22:38.040
We're equal in our natures, and the troubled part comes this way.

22:38.040 --> 22:45.400
If our natures include how we come to be, then the differences between the sexes are

22:45.400 --> 22:51.760
also part of our rights and also, therefore, our obligations.

22:51.760 --> 22:56.640
And that's what you're telling me this morning about a law that's proceeding in Ireland,

22:56.640 --> 23:04.080
and they're going to make it illegal to possess books that claim that sex is an innate feature

23:04.080 --> 23:05.720
or that you don't get to choose your own.

23:05.720 --> 23:06.720
Is that what it is?

23:06.720 --> 23:07.720
That's part of it.

23:07.720 --> 23:08.720
Yeah.

23:08.720 --> 23:09.720
Yeah.

23:09.720 --> 23:10.720
Well, it depends on how they define.

23:10.720 --> 23:17.240
But it depends on how they end up defining hate speech, but that's already built into

23:17.240 --> 23:23.840
the law, the idea that making a distinction between men and women that's categorical,

23:23.840 --> 23:25.480
that's already part of hate speech.

23:25.480 --> 23:26.480
Yeah.

23:26.480 --> 23:27.480
Yeah.

23:27.480 --> 23:32.200
Well, it is in part outsprings.

23:32.200 --> 23:35.040
This is, again, where you see the weakness in Nietzsche's argument.

23:35.040 --> 23:37.560
Well, here's the values we've created.

23:37.560 --> 23:40.440
Well, that's not a very good replacement for God.

23:40.440 --> 23:46.480
Our replacement for God is narcissistic radicals get to do whatever the hell they want, whenever

23:46.480 --> 23:48.160
they want, all the time.

23:48.160 --> 23:51.240
And if you oppose it, then it's prison for you.

23:51.240 --> 23:56.560
Well, that's not much of a substitute for what we had before.

23:56.560 --> 24:04.520
And that was our, I went to the church of the Holy Sepulcher in Rome, and that was the

24:04.520 --> 24:07.560
first established church.

24:07.560 --> 24:11.520
And it became the model for European society.

24:11.520 --> 24:16.800
So it's so interesting the way these conceptions are laid out, let's say, architecturally rather

24:16.800 --> 24:18.520
than conceptually.

24:18.520 --> 24:24.360
So at the very center, you have the crucifix, the cross, and that's what would you say?

24:24.360 --> 24:29.440
That's the point where all of reality comes to a point.

24:29.440 --> 24:32.760
And it's the point of maximal suffering, and it's more than that.

24:32.800 --> 24:36.320
It's the point of voluntarily accepted maximal suffering.

24:36.320 --> 24:41.600
And the notion is that that's a sacrifice.

24:41.600 --> 24:42.840
Why is it a sacrifice?

24:42.840 --> 24:49.760
You have to sacrifice, you have to sacrifice your lower self to your higher self in order

24:49.760 --> 24:55.680
for you to proceed in a healthy manner to be resilient, but also for you to participate

24:55.680 --> 24:59.040
in the covenant that would make for a united society.

24:59.520 --> 25:04.520
There's no difference between that maturation, because a lot of what maturation is, is to

25:04.520 --> 25:10.320
give up the attractions of the immediate present in the service of something broader

25:10.320 --> 25:11.320
and higher.

25:11.320 --> 25:15.360
And that would be you in the broader sense, and what's in your best interest, but also

25:15.360 --> 25:17.240
the community simultaneously.

25:17.240 --> 25:19.080
Those are the same thing.

25:19.080 --> 25:23.360
So at the center of the community, you have the sacrifice, the voluntary sacrifice of

25:23.360 --> 25:24.360
self.

25:24.360 --> 25:25.360
That's the center.

25:25.360 --> 25:29.720
You have the church, you have the altar, then you have the church, then you have the town,

25:29.720 --> 25:33.040
and around the town you have the state, and then you have the nation.

25:33.040 --> 25:37.920
And that's all resting on this spirit of voluntary self-sacrifice, right?

25:37.920 --> 25:41.160
And that's the foundation stone of the community.

25:41.160 --> 25:45.120
Jung knew that, Jung knew that, and Freud didn't.

25:45.120 --> 25:51.120
And because Freud was, he was a materialistic, deterministic atheist of the 19th century,

25:51.120 --> 25:53.240
and Jung is a 20th century thinker.

25:53.240 --> 25:55.640
Maybe he's a 21st century thinker, even.

25:55.640 --> 25:57.120
That's certainly possible.

25:57.120 --> 26:03.480
So Churchill said, he wrote once in a book called My Early Life, you must nail your life

26:03.480 --> 26:06.440
to a cross of thought or action.

26:06.440 --> 26:11.880
Now he ended up doing both, but in other case, whichever way you go, and so you could say,

26:11.880 --> 26:17.760
in your life, Jordan Peterson, it was more thought in the beginning, and it might be

26:17.760 --> 26:21.960
more action now, but in other case, it's a cross.

26:21.960 --> 26:24.200
How do you think of it?

26:24.200 --> 26:29.000
Well, you can either lift up a cross or have one dropped on you, right?

26:29.000 --> 26:32.320
There's no non-cross option in this world.

26:32.320 --> 26:35.720
And that's really worth knowing too, and I tell my audiences that consistently.

26:35.720 --> 26:43.280
It's like, you all know perfectly well that your idiot hedonism, your idiot immature hedonism

26:43.280 --> 26:46.680
is going to vanish in a puff of smoke at the first sign of trouble.

26:46.680 --> 26:50.240
You know that, and you know that it's thin, gruel.

26:50.240 --> 26:53.800
That's why you're hedonistic and hopeless at the same time.

26:53.800 --> 26:54.840
You know that.

26:54.840 --> 26:57.080
You need something beyond that.

26:57.080 --> 26:58.080
Why?

26:58.080 --> 27:04.400
Because life in some ways is unbearable, and so you need something worth bearing to make

27:04.400 --> 27:09.800
it bearable, and life is very heavy load, and so that means you have to carry something

27:09.800 --> 27:12.560
very heavy to justify it.

27:12.560 --> 27:17.160
Now, I see this in the biblical corpus, for example, quite clearly laid out in the story

27:17.160 --> 27:19.080
of Abraham, which is a very interesting story.

27:19.080 --> 27:24.920
Of course, Abraham is the founder of nations, and so you might say, well, is that true?

27:24.920 --> 27:28.360
It's like, those are such stupid questions.

27:28.360 --> 27:30.360
That's such a stupid question.

27:30.360 --> 27:32.080
It's a definition in this story.

27:32.080 --> 27:40.280
So the definition is the spirit of Abraham is the founder of nations, right?

27:40.280 --> 27:44.800
That's the declaration of the story, and you're to come to understand that when you read the

27:44.800 --> 27:45.800
story.

27:46.160 --> 27:49.640
Now, you might say, well, what did the people who wrote the story mean by that?

27:49.640 --> 27:54.280
And the answer is, well, they didn't know, and that's why they wrote the story.

27:54.280 --> 27:56.120
Like the story is the explanation.

27:56.120 --> 27:58.160
Okay, so what's the story?

27:58.160 --> 28:04.720
Well, Abraham is a human being, and that means he's like a natural human being, and that

28:04.720 --> 28:08.000
means he's useless and lazy.

28:08.000 --> 28:11.520
And if he can have it easy, he will.

28:11.520 --> 28:15.320
And so Abraham is like the first case of white privilege.

28:15.320 --> 28:16.560
He's a good joke.

28:16.560 --> 28:17.560
He's rich.

28:17.560 --> 28:22.200
His parents are rich, and he can just lay around his tent all day and eat peeled grapes

28:22.200 --> 28:27.240
and have like beautiful slave women wave palm fronds over him and do nothing.

28:27.240 --> 28:31.120
And he does that for like 83 years.

28:31.120 --> 28:34.240
And then one day a voice comes to him, right, a spirit.

28:34.240 --> 28:37.440
He's inspired by a spirit.

28:37.440 --> 28:39.400
And what's the nature of the spirit?

28:39.400 --> 28:43.240
Well, it's the spirit that calls him to adventure.

28:43.240 --> 28:47.280
And it says to him, get your lazy ass the hell out of the tent.

28:47.280 --> 28:50.080
You're made for more than this.

28:50.080 --> 28:58.200
And so Abraham, in a great act of faith, abides by the intuition of this spirit, and he leaves

28:58.200 --> 29:02.720
his comfortable infancy, right, because he's an infant.

29:02.720 --> 29:05.760
He lives in an infantile utopia.

29:05.760 --> 29:07.640
So, right, well, what do I want?

29:07.640 --> 29:11.640
Well, I never want to be hungry, and I never want to be thirsty.

29:12.400 --> 29:13.760
I never want to be deprived.

29:13.760 --> 29:16.560
It's like, well, great, you're an infant sleeping in a crib.

29:16.560 --> 29:17.960
You've got infant paradise.

29:17.960 --> 29:19.520
Is that what you're made for, right?

29:19.520 --> 29:22.560
The mere cessation of your needs.

29:22.560 --> 29:24.360
That's your vision of utopia, is it?

29:24.360 --> 29:26.560
Well, that was Abraham's vision of utopia.

29:26.560 --> 29:30.880
And a counter spirit came along and said, get your lazy ass the hell out of your tent

29:30.880 --> 29:32.520
and get out there in the world.

29:32.520 --> 29:34.680
And of course, it's a complete catastrophe, right?

29:34.680 --> 29:42.600
Like, he faces tyranny and war and the necessary sacrifice of his son and collusion among the

29:42.600 --> 29:48.600
aristocrats to steal his wife, and, like, it's just a disaster in 10 different directions.

29:48.600 --> 29:50.120
But it's an adventure.

29:50.120 --> 29:52.440
It's an adventure, right?

29:52.440 --> 29:54.600
And so what's life?

29:54.600 --> 29:57.280
Is it hedonistic, infantile bliss?

29:57.280 --> 30:00.720
This is something Dostoyevsky objected to, or is it a romantic adventure?

30:00.720 --> 30:04.320
Well, what do people go watch when they go see a movie?

30:04.320 --> 30:05.880
They watch a romantic adventure.

30:05.880 --> 30:06.880
Well, why?

30:06.880 --> 30:08.360
Because that's what they want in their life.

30:08.360 --> 30:15.120
They don't want peace and tranquility and guaranteed basic income and the pleasures of

30:15.120 --> 30:18.480
infantile, gratified infantile dependence.

30:18.480 --> 30:20.400
They want a bloody adventure.

30:20.400 --> 30:24.480
And if they don't get a real adventure, they'll take a false one and wreak havoc.

30:24.480 --> 30:27.360
And we have no shortage of false adventures in our culture.

30:27.360 --> 30:33.440
So the woke culture and the transgender movement and all these great things that have come

30:33.440 --> 30:37.960
upon us so hard, are they going to suppress that for people?

30:37.960 --> 30:39.720
You're not going to get to have your adventure.

30:39.720 --> 30:40.720
You're going to have to...

30:40.720 --> 30:45.200
Well, they put forward a false adventure, and the false adventure is wave a placard

30:45.200 --> 30:46.680
and save the world.

30:46.680 --> 30:47.680
That's right.

30:47.680 --> 30:48.680
Great.

30:48.680 --> 30:49.680
Isn't that wonderful?

30:49.680 --> 30:54.560
All you have to do, you know how I stopped getting protesters to my events at university?

30:54.560 --> 30:57.360
I held them in the morning.

30:57.360 --> 30:58.360
That's great.

30:58.360 --> 30:59.360
No kidding, eh?

30:59.360 --> 31:00.360
I'm the Messiah.

31:00.360 --> 31:01.360
Yeah, really?

31:01.360 --> 31:05.640
Well, as long as you don't want me to get out of bed before noon, yeah.

31:05.640 --> 31:08.360
So that's the false adventure sold to young kids.

31:08.360 --> 31:11.320
It's like, well, the planet's going to hell in a handbasket.

31:11.320 --> 31:12.320
That's the claim.

31:12.320 --> 31:16.040
It's like, yeah, yeah, the planet's always been going to hell in a handbasket, right?

31:16.040 --> 31:21.120
The apocalypse is always nigh, and that's because we die and so does everything else.

31:21.120 --> 31:26.880
And so, well, the apocalypse is nigh, and you can save the world by protesting against

31:26.880 --> 31:28.520
those who are at fault.

31:28.520 --> 31:30.920
That's what universities sell young people.

31:30.920 --> 31:32.440
Well, it's an adventure, right?

31:32.440 --> 31:37.680
They have a messianic urge at that age, and that really never goes away in people in some

31:37.680 --> 31:42.840
fundamental sense, but it's particularly acute when late adolescents are trying to catalyze

31:42.840 --> 31:46.600
their identity, and the left offers these false adventures.

31:46.600 --> 31:54.440
You print out a sign that says, I oppose poverty as if anyone doesn't, and you wave that around

31:54.440 --> 31:57.040
publicly, which is the same as praying in public, right?

31:57.040 --> 31:58.280
It's a great sin.

31:58.280 --> 32:02.640
And you proclaim your moral virtue, and bang, that's your adventure.

32:02.640 --> 32:07.920
And it's a cheap pathway to reputational accomplishment.

32:07.920 --> 32:12.280
And part of the reason young guys do it, you know perfectly well, is because they're trying

32:12.280 --> 32:21.960
to impress young women, and it's kind of, what would you say, there's a surface attraction

32:21.960 --> 32:29.240
to being a kind of rebellious quasi-shea guavara type, and to be taking on the evil corporations

32:29.240 --> 32:36.480
of the world when you're 18, you know, instead of working at 7-Eleven and handing out sugar

32:36.480 --> 32:37.480
water to kids.

32:37.480 --> 32:44.720
Do you think that there's something that young people really need that will ultimately redeem

32:44.720 --> 32:48.360
them from this, enough of them at least, to save the world?

32:48.360 --> 32:49.360
Do you think that...

32:49.360 --> 32:50.360
They need a burden.

32:50.360 --> 32:51.360
They need a burden.

32:51.760 --> 32:52.360
Absolutely.

32:52.360 --> 32:53.360
And they want one, you're saying.

32:53.360 --> 32:54.360
You get, absolutely.

32:54.360 --> 32:58.800
Well, and you can explain that to them in some ways the way I just explained it.

32:58.800 --> 33:04.160
It's like, look, guys, you're going to suffer, and most of them are already suffering, so

33:04.160 --> 33:05.160
they know that.

33:05.160 --> 33:08.960
It's like, and do you want to suffer stupidly too?

33:08.960 --> 33:10.680
Because that's even worse.

33:10.680 --> 33:15.920
And then do you want to contemplate for a moment what's going to be your arc when the

33:15.920 --> 33:16.920
storms come?

33:16.920 --> 33:20.520
Well, I can tell you what it is, and you already know this because you've consulted your own

33:20.560 --> 33:21.560
conscience.

33:21.560 --> 33:24.920
When you're awake at 3 in the morning thinking about what a useless bastard you are, how

33:24.920 --> 33:28.960
many sins you have on your conscience, if you're fortunate, there'll be a few of your

33:28.960 --> 33:35.000
adventures come to mind where you think, well, you know, I didn't do so bad then.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.800
You know, maybe there's something to me.

33:37.800 --> 33:41.620
And so what do people remember when they have those memories?

33:41.620 --> 33:45.480
They remember the times when they stepped outside of their narrow cells and took on

33:45.480 --> 33:49.080
some bloody responsibility, at least for themselves.

33:49.080 --> 33:55.080
And then maybe for someone else too, and then maybe for a lot of other people.

33:55.080 --> 34:01.200
And so if you tell young man, look, you're going to find the meaning in your life by

34:01.200 --> 34:07.440
adopting maximal responsibility, right?

34:07.440 --> 34:10.780
That's going to be extremely difficult because you're so bloody useless.

34:10.780 --> 34:15.760
You can't even get your own house in order, and you're going to be called upon not only

34:15.760 --> 34:20.040
to get your house in order, but to do that well enough so some woman can stand having

34:20.040 --> 34:24.240
you around for more than like 15 minutes in the back of a car.

34:24.240 --> 34:28.040
And then maybe you're going to have to do it so that you could be a good father to a

34:28.040 --> 34:30.560
family and a pillar of the community.

34:30.560 --> 34:32.360
And that's not just empty words.

34:32.360 --> 34:37.600
Like if you do that nobly, there'll be something to you.

34:37.600 --> 34:44.240
And then when the storms come, you won't be blown over by the first four foot wave.

34:44.240 --> 34:49.880
And young men think, huh, I mean, I could be something that wasn't blown over by the

34:49.880 --> 34:51.720
first four foot wave.

34:51.720 --> 34:57.280
They think, oh, well, that's, that's, that's inspiring.

34:57.280 --> 35:00.720
Maybe that's worth doing a little work towards it on the off chance.

35:00.720 --> 35:02.640
It might be true.

35:02.640 --> 35:05.480
And the thing about it is, it is true.

35:05.480 --> 35:10.400
So it's not that difficult once you understand it to make a case for it.

35:10.400 --> 35:11.400
It's true.

35:11.400 --> 35:17.120
And it is also true that you grow in proportion to the weight you take on voluntarily.

35:17.120 --> 35:21.560
And it's also true that we have no idea what the upper limit to that is, right?

35:21.560 --> 35:25.800
So, you know, you, you've met remarkable people in your life.

35:25.800 --> 35:27.740
People can do remarkable things.

35:27.740 --> 35:32.220
And there are inevitably people who take, who took on remarkable burdens.

35:32.220 --> 35:36.720
And because they did that, their development was forced by necessity.

35:36.720 --> 35:41.960
They were forced by necessity to grow beyond what they were.

35:41.960 --> 35:44.840
And who knows what the limit to that is.

35:44.840 --> 35:49.800
People, so something I see in the college business, our college, Schillstock College,

35:49.800 --> 35:53.680
has got about the same number of boys and girls, a few more boys.

35:53.680 --> 35:58.920
And they come from a pool of applicants that are equal size and equal qualification.

35:58.920 --> 36:00.840
Almost nobody has that.

36:00.840 --> 36:05.840
And the boys do just about as well as the girls, although they do get into contests

36:05.880 --> 36:09.800
doing things like throwing deer urine on each other and stuff, they've done that.

36:09.800 --> 36:11.880
But some of the best boys I've ever met have done that.

36:11.880 --> 36:15.200
As a matter of fact, they're in the Marine Corps now, stupid boys.

36:15.200 --> 36:22.320
And they, and, and the thing is, people will say, how are you successful with boys?

36:22.320 --> 36:26.960
And I say, we treat them like boys, you know, they want to be treated like boys.

36:26.960 --> 36:33.440
They, and, and girls, women, we've always had boys and girls here, women and men here, right?

36:33.440 --> 36:34.720
And they've always done well.

36:34.720 --> 36:39.560
And their intellectual capacities are, you know, they're the same kind of thing.

36:39.560 --> 36:44.800
And their physical paths are not the same.

36:44.800 --> 36:48.320
And they can wish them the same if they want to.

36:48.320 --> 36:51.080
But, but they don't.

36:51.080 --> 36:52.480
No, really, they don't.

36:52.480 --> 36:59.120
I mean, I, you know what I find is, and, and, you know, I have two daughters.

36:59.120 --> 37:06.520
You have one, I think, and she's, your daughter is like my daughter's very tough, very assertive,

37:06.520 --> 37:08.520
very womanly, you see.

37:08.520 --> 37:16.560
And so in other words, the classic account is they're good at being what they are.

37:16.560 --> 37:21.280
And that's a service, you know, human above all, but also male or female.

37:21.280 --> 37:25.440
And that's a service that burden you're talking about.

37:25.480 --> 37:30.720
The first burden everyone carries is, how do you become a good one of these?

37:30.720 --> 37:36.000
And by, if by thinking it, that's all.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.520
As you say, that's no burden.

37:38.520 --> 37:41.360
So no satisfaction.

37:41.360 --> 37:43.240
How do you think?

37:43.240 --> 37:45.600
Predict the future for me a little bit.

37:45.600 --> 37:47.840
What's, what's going to happen?

37:47.840 --> 37:49.520
Seems to me things are coming to a point.

37:49.520 --> 37:52.160
Do you think so?

37:52.200 --> 37:56.480
Yeah, well, I think things have always been coming to a point, but they're coming to a

37:56.480 --> 37:58.800
point way faster.

37:58.800 --> 38:03.680
And I mean, that's partly a consequence of the technological revolution.

38:03.680 --> 38:08.080
I mean, we know that, well, we have Moore's law, right?

38:08.080 --> 38:10.880
Computing power doubles every 18 months.

38:10.880 --> 38:13.160
It's like, no, no, you don't understand.

38:13.160 --> 38:16.720
Computing power doubles every 18 months.

38:16.720 --> 38:18.440
That's not some casual phrase.

38:18.440 --> 38:23.040
That's an absolute bloody revolution in every possible direction.

38:23.040 --> 38:24.560
And it's not just computing power.

38:24.560 --> 38:25.560
It's storage power.

38:25.560 --> 38:28.160
And there's all sorts of doublings take taking place.

38:28.160 --> 38:33.480
And we're now at the point in, in the course of technological pro progress, where those

38:33.480 --> 38:37.840
doublings are happening multiple times within the span of a single life.

38:37.840 --> 38:39.000
And so it's pretty obvious.

38:39.000 --> 38:43.000
And that means the ancient archetypal battles are accelerating.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.560
That's exactly what it means.

38:44.560 --> 38:47.400
The battles between good and evil is accelerating.

38:47.440 --> 38:49.120
And it's always been there.

38:49.120 --> 38:50.920
Is the apocalypse nigh?

38:50.920 --> 38:54.680
It's like, well, it's always been nigh, but it might be a little more nigh than it

38:54.680 --> 38:56.160
has been in the past.

38:56.160 --> 38:58.400
You've been talking about artificial intelligence.

38:58.400 --> 39:02.320
And recently I have become more concerned about that.

39:02.320 --> 39:05.120
What are your concerns and what are your hopes for it?

39:05.120 --> 39:08.920
Well, I suppose my fundamental concern is that we'll automate a super intelligent

39:08.920 --> 39:10.680
tyranny, right?

39:10.680 --> 39:12.720
And I mean, that's not a concern that's limited to me.

39:12.720 --> 39:18.280
That's the, that's the motif of endless numbers of science fiction dystopias.

39:18.280 --> 39:23.680
And, you know, science fiction is where you, where engineers dream, right?

39:23.680 --> 39:28.320
And sometimes it's where they have their nightmares and engineers are notoriously

39:28.320 --> 39:29.320
atheistic.

39:29.320 --> 39:33.240
And so they turn to worship of Star Wars, for example, as an alternative.

39:33.240 --> 39:39.600
But their nightmares and dreams are in the popular culture, in popular imagination.

39:39.640 --> 39:42.600
And dystopian science fiction is the nightmare of engineers.

39:42.600 --> 39:46.920
And the nightmare of tower of babble building engineers is that we'll automate

39:46.920 --> 39:50.120
a super intelligent tyranny.

39:50.120 --> 39:52.520
Chinese are hell bent on doing that.

39:52.520 --> 39:53.840
They're doing it at the moment.

39:53.840 --> 39:55.400
Could we do it here?

39:55.400 --> 39:56.320
Absolutely.

39:56.320 --> 39:57.560
Are we?

39:57.560 --> 39:58.680
Yeah.

39:58.680 --> 40:02.120
Will it, will, will that dominate?

40:02.120 --> 40:03.760
We'll see.

40:03.760 --> 40:07.840
You know, my sense, and I learned a fair bit of this from Jung, but, you know, what

40:07.960 --> 40:14.280
one of the things I learned from Jung was that deeply was that salvation, redemption,

40:14.280 --> 40:18.440
was an individual enterprise, which is why I'm a psychologist and not a politician,

40:18.440 --> 40:20.160
because I believe that to be true.

40:20.160 --> 40:26.920
I think that hell is, what would you say, kept at bay one person at a time.

40:26.920 --> 40:30.760
And I do believe that people have a divine destiny, let's say.

40:30.760 --> 40:37.240
And one of the proper elements of our divine destiny is to keep hell at bay.

40:37.240 --> 40:43.680
And you do that by, you do that as a consequence of your choices as an individual.

40:43.680 --> 40:49.360
I also believe that every single individual is, is in that up to their necks.

40:49.360 --> 40:52.480
You know, Dostoevsky said something very strange at one point.

40:52.480 --> 40:57.360
He said, every man is responsible not only for everything he does, but for everyone,

40:57.360 --> 40:59.080
everyone else does.

40:59.080 --> 41:00.760
And of course, that's insane, right?

41:00.800 --> 41:07.760
In that crazy Dostoevsky way that is more sane, that insanity that's more sane than

41:07.760 --> 41:10.200
sanity, that's Dostoevsky in a nutshell.

41:10.200 --> 41:15.160
And I think there's something true about it is that we each have an archetypal destiny

41:15.160 --> 41:20.320
and the fate of the world rests on each person's shoulders, like genuinely.

41:20.320 --> 41:24.240
And when I'm traveling around the world talking to people, I'm trying to tell them

41:24.240 --> 41:28.280
that's like, no, no, you don't understand, this is up to you.

41:28.600 --> 41:32.320
Now, I don't understand how it can be up to you because it's also up to me.

41:32.720 --> 41:37.240
And I don't exactly see how it can be equally and finally up to both of us.

41:37.240 --> 41:38.640
But that's OK.

41:38.640 --> 41:40.720
There's lots of things about the world I don't understand.

41:40.720 --> 41:46.680
And I suppose being, what would you say, touched by a spark of divinity, which is,

41:46.680 --> 41:50.800
I suppose, what characterizes us, each of us bears an infinite responsibility.

41:51.440 --> 41:55.520
And people need to know that and that it's this is no game.

41:56.400 --> 41:59.320
So you have to carry the burden for more than your own sake.

42:00.440 --> 42:04.560
Well, well, it it you're you're in this dish.

42:04.560 --> 42:08.360
You're in this, your sake is indistinguishable from the sake of the totality.

42:08.560 --> 42:10.320
See, the Buddha figured this out, right?

42:10.320 --> 42:11.880
Because Buddha.

42:13.840 --> 42:14.520
What would you say?

42:14.520 --> 42:18.000
He he he achieved enlightenment under the bowtree.

42:18.200 --> 42:19.200
He was in Nirvana.

42:19.200 --> 42:21.840
He was in paradise and he could stay there.

42:22.360 --> 42:23.480
That was on the table.

42:23.520 --> 42:26.600
And that's a hell of an offer to be able to stay in paradise.

42:26.840 --> 42:27.760
And he rejected it.

42:27.760 --> 42:31.400
And the reason he rejected it was because in his estimation, any

42:31.400 --> 42:34.400
paradise that it didn't include, everyone wasn't the real paradise.

42:34.840 --> 42:39.720
And so he left Nirvana to come back to earth, so to speak, to serve as a teacher,

42:39.720 --> 42:42.640
to drag everyone else along on the road to Nirvana.

42:43.000 --> 42:44.040
And that's.

42:45.200 --> 42:49.480
Well, that's that's that's correct, is that that that.

42:50.480 --> 42:54.400
It's correct in that they're in the final analysis.

42:54.400 --> 42:57.840
There is no distinction between you and someone else.

42:58.280 --> 42:59.960
It's a terrible thing to contemplate.

43:00.600 --> 43:01.920
They're the same thing.

43:02.560 --> 43:05.240
And that's why you're supposed to love your enemy, I suppose.

43:05.240 --> 43:07.120
And what does that mean to love your enemy?

43:07.320 --> 43:10.440
Well, first of all, it might mean to begin with, to hope that he wouldn't have

43:10.440 --> 43:12.760
to be an enemy because why not have a friend?

43:12.960 --> 43:16.600
But it's even more than that is that to the degree that it's possible,

43:17.080 --> 43:20.640
your actions, even in the presence of your enemy, should be devoted towards

43:20.640 --> 43:22.160
the redemption of your enemy.

43:23.280 --> 43:25.120
That would be better for you and for them.

43:25.600 --> 43:30.240
I mean, if you're good and your enemy is not good, you'd be right to oppose

43:30.240 --> 43:34.920
them for the sake of the good and those who represent it.

43:35.520 --> 43:39.080
But while you redeem what you can redeem and you reject the rest, right?

43:39.080 --> 43:41.360
And that's the separation of the wheat from the chaff.

43:41.360 --> 43:41.800
That's it.

43:41.800 --> 43:46.200
Well, I learned something a while back about there's this idea at the end

43:46.200 --> 43:51.160
of Genesis, when God throws Adam and Eve out of paradise, he sets these

43:51.160 --> 43:55.600
cherubs up to guard the gates of paradise and their monstrous forms, these

43:55.600 --> 43:59.680
cherubs, and they hold swords that are on fire that turn every which way.

43:59.920 --> 44:01.240
It's a very horrifying image.

44:01.240 --> 44:02.760
And what does it mean?

44:03.040 --> 44:08.080
It means that well, a sword cuts and cleaves and butchers and kills, but a

44:08.080 --> 44:11.200
sword can be used to carve, so you can think about a sword as an

44:11.200 --> 44:14.840
implement that separates the wheat from the chaff and a burning sword.

44:15.040 --> 44:16.280
Well, that's even worse, right?

44:16.280 --> 44:18.200
Because it burns the dead wood away.

44:18.400 --> 44:23.520
And so a burning, a flaming sword is a sword that cuts all that isn't

44:23.520 --> 44:26.400
necessary away and burns all the dead wood off.

44:26.400 --> 44:31.800
And of course, that's the case because everything unworthy has to be cut away

44:32.160 --> 44:35.160
in order for it to enter paradise by definition.

44:35.360 --> 44:40.640
And all dead wood has to be burned away before the living essence can enter

44:40.640 --> 44:41.200
paradise.

44:41.200 --> 44:42.640
That's another way of thinking about it.

44:43.000 --> 44:48.760
And if you're 99% dead wood and pathology, it isn't obvious that the

44:48.760 --> 44:52.280
encounter with the flaming sword that turns every which way won't just do you

44:52.280 --> 44:52.600
in.

44:53.360 --> 44:55.720
And that's, that's the issue of evil.

44:55.760 --> 45:01.480
In some regard, you want to redeem what can be redeemed, but you need to

45:01.480 --> 45:03.200
reject what's truly serpentine.

45:03.720 --> 45:05.200
And that's Eve's sin, by the way.

45:05.760 --> 45:06.760
She doesn't do that.

45:06.760 --> 45:11.360
She hearkens to the serpent itself, and that's a narcissism of compassion.

45:11.360 --> 45:12.120
That's her sin.

45:12.120 --> 45:13.600
It's a pride of compassion.

45:13.800 --> 45:19.040
My womanly embrace is such that all things can be clasped by breast, including

45:19.040 --> 45:20.200
the poisonous serpent.

45:20.280 --> 45:24.800
It's like, well, yeah, maybe, maybe not including the poisonous serpent.

45:25.520 --> 45:25.760
Right.

45:25.760 --> 45:29.640
And I see that playing out in the world now because we have this epidemic of

45:29.640 --> 45:34.320
narcissistic compassion where everything can be invited to the table.

45:34.880 --> 45:38.320
It's like, well, maybe not everything.

45:39.200 --> 45:39.600
Right.

45:39.640 --> 45:40.080
Right.

45:40.240 --> 45:47.760
And maybe there's only a small remnant of what is truly hellish that has to be

45:47.760 --> 45:51.040
rejected, that there's no hope of redeeming.

45:51.240 --> 45:54.160
I mean, this is an ancient theological issue, right?

45:54.200 --> 45:59.040
But this was played out quite recently in the case of Nicola Sturgeon, right?

45:59.080 --> 46:04.280
Because Sturgeon in the Scottish prime minister, no, she famously proclaimed

46:04.280 --> 46:07.640
that, well, any man who says he's a woman is a woman.

46:08.640 --> 46:10.040
It's like, I'm so compassionate.

46:10.040 --> 46:11.840
It's like, people can do whatever they want.

46:12.120 --> 46:13.960
It's like, any man, eh?

46:15.160 --> 46:21.400
How about psychopathic, serialist, serial killing, sadistic rapists?

46:21.800 --> 46:22.720
How about them?

46:23.960 --> 46:28.120
Well, when she was asked that question, which she was, she had to hand wave

46:28.360 --> 46:33.000
partly because for someone like her, no one like that exists, not really.

46:33.840 --> 46:38.160
But the problem is, is that people like that do exist or spirits like that exist.

46:38.200 --> 46:42.480
So there's an immediate thing we see here coming from artificial intelligence.

46:42.920 --> 46:47.080
And it's, it can do a passable job writing a term paper.

46:47.760 --> 46:48.720
We can stop that here.

46:48.720 --> 46:52.120
We have an honor code and most, most kids won't do it, almost all.

46:52.640 --> 46:56.240
And if they do, it's not too, you know, eventually it'll be indistinguishable.

46:56.280 --> 46:56.920
I'm told.

46:57.120 --> 46:58.720
Oh, yes, but they're already.

46:59.120 --> 47:02.480
But, you know, oral exams, but here's what I'm worried about.

47:03.720 --> 47:07.320
This is the chairman of Microsoft, who I used to think was a pretty good guy.

47:07.760 --> 47:09.800
He proclaims, well, it's not going to write your final.

47:09.800 --> 47:11.120
It's going to write your draft.

47:12.000 --> 47:14.840
But writing your draft, that's where you do most of the learning.

47:15.640 --> 47:19.560
That's where you read all the stuff that surrounds your subject and decide what's

47:19.560 --> 47:24.040
relevant. And that means that, and it goes back to something you've taught me.

47:24.040 --> 47:29.560
And that is, if you can't write a draft of a paper or write your own paper,

47:30.240 --> 47:31.400
you become a cripple.

47:31.600 --> 47:34.440
Well, that's, see, that's the fundamental issue in the argument.

47:34.440 --> 47:39.320
It's, it's, because you could say, well, why not just let, if your point is the

47:39.320 --> 47:43.520
degree, why not just let AI write your paper and, and handed in and get your A.

47:43.920 --> 47:44.760
And it's simple.

47:44.760 --> 47:45.800
It's really quite simple.

47:48.200 --> 47:51.800
I think it was Alfred North Whitehead who said this is very, very wise thing.

47:53.560 --> 47:58.760
You think so that your thoughts can die instead of you.

47:59.560 --> 47:59.840
Okay.

47:59.840 --> 48:01.560
Now this is biologically true.

48:01.560 --> 48:05.240
This is what makes human beings different from all other creatures, right?

48:05.240 --> 48:10.160
Maybe this is the spark of God in some sense tied to the biology.

48:10.760 --> 48:14.000
So the prefrontal cortex, which is the part of the brain that generates

48:14.000 --> 48:18.240
abstractions grew out of the motor cortex, which is the part of the brain that

48:18.240 --> 48:20.600
enables you to voluntarily sequence your actions.

48:21.160 --> 48:26.080
So what thought is thought is the space in which you create avatars of action.

48:26.880 --> 48:27.120
Right.

48:27.120 --> 48:31.200
So what a thought we think, because we're materialist atheists and we think

48:31.200 --> 48:34.720
we're scientists, we think that a thought is a description of the objective

48:34.720 --> 48:35.600
nature of the world.

48:35.960 --> 48:37.720
And that was, isn't what a thought is.

48:38.160 --> 48:43.360
A thought is a micro, it's a microcosmic avatar of you.

48:44.280 --> 48:45.280
That's what a thought is.

48:45.640 --> 48:50.920
And if it's a stupid thought, if then you could act it out, you could embody

48:50.920 --> 48:52.680
that avatar and then it would become you.

48:53.320 --> 48:58.760
But if it's, if it's a faulty avatar and you act it out, then you'll die.

48:59.440 --> 49:01.720
Or worse, because there are worse things than dying.

49:01.960 --> 49:03.680
You'll end up in something like hell.

49:04.880 --> 49:11.680
And so why think so that you can generate virtual selves?

49:13.320 --> 49:17.760
Then why think critically so you can kill off the idiot virtual selves

49:17.760 --> 49:19.000
before you enact them?

49:19.560 --> 49:23.720
Why do that so you don't die or end up in hell?

49:23.880 --> 49:24.640
That's why.

49:24.960 --> 49:29.560
So why should you think so you don't die and end up or end up in hell?

49:29.840 --> 49:31.000
How do you learn to think?

49:31.200 --> 49:34.240
Well, not by having AI write your damn papers.

49:34.480 --> 49:36.920
The reason you're learning to write is because there's no difference

49:36.920 --> 49:38.160
between writing and thinking.

49:38.600 --> 49:42.040
And the reason you're learning to think is so that you don't, not only so

49:42.040 --> 49:46.640
that you don't fall into a pit, but so that you don't pull everyone you

49:46.680 --> 49:49.440
love kicking and screaming into the pit with you.

49:49.880 --> 49:55.440
And so you have cheat, cheat, go ahead, see what happens.

49:56.160 --> 50:00.240
So, so what you do with a liberal arts education, which you do very well here

50:00.240 --> 50:05.360
is you say, don't cheat because you'll put your immortal soul in danger.

50:05.760 --> 50:07.320
And people say, well, I don't believe in that.

50:07.320 --> 50:11.800
So that's like, go right ahead, take your chances.

50:12.040 --> 50:16.720
You know, you make the presumption that you can manipulate the world

50:16.720 --> 50:21.520
by lying and cheating, go out there and enact that and watch what happens.

50:22.120 --> 50:25.440
You know, we're having an argument about your culture in our culture,

50:25.440 --> 50:26.320
but what's true?

50:26.680 --> 50:27.880
It's a deep argument.

50:28.720 --> 50:32.960
The scientists say, well, objective truth is true, but that's problematic

50:32.960 --> 50:35.080
because objective truth gives us no direction.

50:35.680 --> 50:39.120
And the postmodernists say, well, there's no overarching metanarrative

50:39.160 --> 50:43.280
and everything is relative and they do that to justify their hedonism.

50:43.640 --> 50:48.600
And the truth of the matter is we don't know how to define what's real.

50:49.080 --> 50:50.760
And most of us are materialists.

50:51.320 --> 50:52.840
The material world is what's real.

50:53.880 --> 50:56.040
Here's a different proposition.

50:57.320 --> 50:59.320
What's real leads you away from hell.

51:00.200 --> 51:01.960
Now, that's actually a definition, right?

51:01.960 --> 51:08.680
It's a, it's a proposition that your life will be conducted most fully.

51:10.120 --> 51:13.880
If you abide by the dictum that what's real is what leads you away from hell.

51:14.640 --> 51:18.240
And you might say, well, why would you assume that hell is real?

51:18.520 --> 51:22.040
And I would say, if you were there, you'd think it was real.

51:23.440 --> 51:23.880
Right.

51:24.040 --> 51:27.200
So, and I don't really know what to make of that metaphysically.

51:27.200 --> 51:30.000
I mean, I believe it's true and I've believed it for a very long time

51:30.000 --> 51:35.040
because I read a lot of literature about hell and you think, well, hell isn't real.

51:35.040 --> 51:38.120
It's like, read about unit 731.

51:39.560 --> 51:42.600
That was a, that was a Japanese medical unit in China.

51:42.960 --> 51:44.840
You read about unit 731.

51:44.840 --> 51:47.880
And I would recommend, by the way, for those of you who are watching or listening,

51:48.040 --> 51:51.480
that you don't do this because you'll regret it if you do.

51:51.880 --> 51:56.520
You read about unit 731 and then come and tell me you don't believe hell is real.

51:57.200 --> 52:02.400
If you read enough about atrocity and totalitarian catastrophe,

52:02.880 --> 52:06.360
you will absolutely walk away from that thinking that hell is real.

52:06.520 --> 52:10.560
And then if you have any sense, you'll think, well, whatever I'm going to do in my life,

52:10.560 --> 52:14.560
I'm going to do whatever takes me as far away as from that as I can possibly get.

52:15.200 --> 52:19.040
You know, when, when this political scandal blew up around me in Canada,

52:19.040 --> 52:21.800
people come up to me and they say this, they say, you're so brave.

52:21.800 --> 52:25.520
And I think you don't understand the difference between you and me

52:25.520 --> 52:28.720
is I know what to be properly afraid of, right?

52:28.720 --> 52:34.560
And I know that when the cat gets your tongue, you will end up in hell.

52:34.760 --> 52:36.960
You lose control of that logos, right?

52:36.960 --> 52:40.880
Because that's your capacity for voluntary speech, voluntary thought.

52:41.240 --> 52:43.080
You lose that link with the logos.

52:44.000 --> 52:45.440
You are headed for hell.

52:45.800 --> 52:47.920
And that is definitely worse than death.

52:48.400 --> 52:49.960
How many could you estimate?

52:49.960 --> 52:53.800
How many hours have you spent in private therapeutic counseling?

52:54.320 --> 52:56.040
I mean, doing counseling with people.

52:59.240 --> 53:01.480
Fifteen thousand hours, I see.

53:01.480 --> 53:07.440
That's seven might be more than that seven full working years and eight.

53:08.000 --> 53:11.360
But here's why that's a that's a conservative estimate.

53:11.640 --> 53:15.520
That's why I asked the question was when you talk like

53:17.040 --> 53:21.600
academics have a good education, which I fancy I do are pretty good at understanding

53:21.600 --> 53:25.120
the implications of propositions, you know, like

53:25.880 --> 53:30.920
if if you said that we're material beings, if we were purely material beings,

53:30.920 --> 53:32.520
of course, we couldn't know it.

53:32.520 --> 53:34.120
Dogs don't know that they're dogs.

53:35.160 --> 53:37.560
But so we were good at things like that, right?

53:38.600 --> 53:44.360
You're good at describing the consequences as they appear in individuals.

53:44.520 --> 53:46.320
And it's very dramatic.

53:46.320 --> 53:50.480
And what is this is one thing, you know, it's in many ways,

53:50.480 --> 53:52.240
it's terrifying to be a therapist.

53:52.240 --> 53:54.200
And there's a variety of reasons for that.

53:54.280 --> 53:56.880
I mean, one of the things you learn if you're

53:58.040 --> 54:02.320
if you're a therapist is that you really learn something about the intrinsic

54:02.320 --> 54:06.680
worth of people like some of the best people I met in my therapeutic practice,

54:06.680 --> 54:10.960
the best people morally were people who were the most who were on the surface.

54:13.280 --> 54:15.400
They had nothing going for them.

54:15.400 --> 54:17.480
No, nothing worldly going for them.

54:17.480 --> 54:18.360
They weren't attractive.

54:18.360 --> 54:19.320
They weren't intelligent.

54:19.320 --> 54:20.960
They weren't accomplished.

54:20.960 --> 54:22.000
They weren't popular.

54:22.000 --> 54:23.920
In fact, they were often friendless.

54:23.920 --> 54:25.760
They often had devastated families.

54:25.760 --> 54:28.520
They had terrible developmental histories.

54:29.160 --> 54:30.720
They just had devastated lives.

54:30.720 --> 54:33.920
And yet there was still a core of ethical goodness to them

54:33.920 --> 54:37.720
that was stunning under the circumstances, miraculous.

54:37.720 --> 54:43.720
And so you really that really takes you back to see that that can happen, right?

54:43.720 --> 54:47.040
To see that sent that essential nobility of the human spirit.

54:48.680 --> 54:51.120
And so so that's a terrifying thing to see.

54:51.720 --> 54:57.520
And then and that that goodness can shine through in places that just look dark

54:57.520 --> 54:59.640
and and that no one is attending to.

54:59.640 --> 55:03.040
And the next thing you learn is don't.

55:04.480 --> 55:09.760
Impose your notions of someone's destiny on them.

55:10.120 --> 55:14.120
You do not know how that person's life should unfold.

55:14.360 --> 55:17.600
You're there to help them think that through.

55:17.880 --> 55:19.920
You are not there to give them advice.

55:20.800 --> 55:24.480
That's it's a theft, giving someone advice, especially if you're a therapist,

55:24.480 --> 55:30.040
is theft because it's theft because if they succeed, well, then it's your success.

55:30.560 --> 55:36.040
And it's corrupt theft because if they fail, they bear the consequences and you don't.

55:36.560 --> 55:39.680
So so that's terrifying.

55:39.680 --> 55:45.040
And then the other thing I learned that was terrifying was I never saw anyone

55:45.040 --> 55:48.040
in my therapeutic practice ever get away with anything even once.

55:49.040 --> 55:51.960
Like that, you know, there's that old idea that God has a book

55:51.960 --> 55:53.880
and and everything you do is written down.

55:53.880 --> 55:56.000
It's like, that's not just an idea.

55:56.640 --> 55:58.040
You get away with nothing.

55:58.040 --> 55:59.720
And of course, it makes sense.

55:59.720 --> 56:05.880
It's like reality is real and you distort and bend it at your peril.

56:05.880 --> 56:13.000
And you may produce a riff temporarily, but that will snap closed on you.

56:13.520 --> 56:18.680
And you may not even notice the connection between your initial sin, failure

56:18.680 --> 56:23.040
to meet the target, to hit the target and the consequences of that.

56:23.360 --> 56:26.920
But the consequences are inevitable and it's even worse than that

56:26.920 --> 56:29.640
because not only are they inevitable, they tend to multiply.

56:30.240 --> 56:35.440
And so all of that to to the degree that I've been capable has scared me straight.

56:35.440 --> 56:38.160
Let's say it's like, no, I'm not going down that path.

56:39.120 --> 56:44.200
And so and you learn to as a therapist, you learn the ancient truth

56:44.200 --> 56:47.080
that the truth is redemptive, right?

56:47.080 --> 56:50.280
And this is this is another of the great accomplishments of Freud

56:50.280 --> 56:54.200
because Freud shed new light on the logos in some ways, right?

56:54.200 --> 56:58.920
Because Freud understood that true speech heals.

57:00.000 --> 57:04.920
Right. I mean, that's his entire therapeutic approach is bring people in

57:05.480 --> 57:09.720
and don't disturb them when they're trying to tell you something.

57:10.400 --> 57:11.720
Let them say anything.

57:11.720 --> 57:13.440
Absolutely. And that's what he told his clients, too.

57:13.440 --> 57:17.240
It's like, say whatever comes to your mind, right?

57:17.240 --> 57:22.240
Let no matter how off color, off putting, embarrassing, shameful,

57:22.560 --> 57:27.400
aggressive, sexual, find out who you are.

57:27.400 --> 57:28.600
That's the first draft.

57:28.600 --> 57:31.040
Lay yourself out on the table.

57:31.040 --> 57:33.800
And while he had them laid themselves out on the couch, he hid from his client

57:33.800 --> 57:36.520
so they couldn't he was afraid that if they saw his face,

57:36.520 --> 57:40.400
they would censor themselves by watching his emotional reactions.

57:40.640 --> 57:45.080
So he sat off to the side of his clients so they could just

57:45.640 --> 57:48.920
say what they had to say with no interference.

57:48.920 --> 57:53.520
And you know this because you're an educator, but

57:55.440 --> 58:00.880
people cannot organize themselves and come to who they are

58:01.320 --> 58:04.480
without laying themselves out and they can't lay themselves out

58:04.480 --> 58:06.560
without thinking or talking.

58:06.560 --> 58:08.800
Most people think by talking.

58:08.800 --> 58:11.280
In fact, you learn to think by talking.

58:11.280 --> 58:13.600
You can't talk if no one listens.

58:13.600 --> 58:16.880
Most people, most people have no one to listen to them.

58:18.000 --> 58:23.000
Yeah. If so, you know, education is a little bit different than therapy,

58:23.000 --> 58:24.600
but sometimes not.

58:24.600 --> 58:27.400
And one way it's different is

58:27.400 --> 58:32.960
now education is a common project that people share

58:33.720 --> 58:37.400
and each has to do his part or he won't get any benefit from it,

58:38.000 --> 58:40.120
but better together, as you say.

58:40.600 --> 58:45.280
And so around here, there's a we have a lot of psychological

58:45.280 --> 58:48.600
counseling here, but also the kids counsel each other.

58:49.160 --> 58:53.440
And that's and that's a different thing because they're in the same boat.

58:53.920 --> 58:55.920
They're trying to get the same thing done.

58:55.960 --> 58:59.720
They want to understand the most important things.

59:00.400 --> 59:02.320
And that's a form of therapy, actually.

59:02.680 --> 59:06.240
Think about it, because well, actually, therapy is a form of that.

59:06.320 --> 59:07.560
Yeah. Right. Right.

59:07.560 --> 59:08.680
Because yeah, sure, sure.

59:08.680 --> 59:11.720
I mean, the therapeutic endeavor is dialogue.

59:12.720 --> 59:14.640
Right. And it's.

59:14.640 --> 59:18.600
I guess the advantage if you have a good therapist, which is very rare

59:18.600 --> 59:22.840
and becoming more and more difficult as it becomes illegal to be a good therapist,

59:22.840 --> 59:25.240
which it already is, by the way,

59:25.240 --> 59:27.720
because it's now illegal to tell your clients what you think.

59:28.200 --> 59:31.360
And so that's the end of that enterprise, because that's all there was to it.

59:31.360 --> 59:35.120
So but. Therapy is.

59:36.800 --> 59:40.000
It's it's dialogue in search of its dialogue.

59:41.200 --> 59:43.080
Look, it's a religious enterprise.

59:43.280 --> 59:45.800
It's motivated by love.

59:45.800 --> 59:46.960
What's our aim here?

59:46.960 --> 59:49.320
Therapeutic aid to make things better.

59:49.600 --> 59:52.320
Why? Because we think it's worthy.

59:52.640 --> 59:55.360
It's a worthy enterprise to make things better.

59:55.360 --> 59:57.360
That's the proclamation of love, right?

59:57.360 --> 59:59.560
Love aims at making things better.

59:59.560 --> 01:00:02.680
Love aims at making the world more abundant.

01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:05.800
It aims at reducing unnecessary suffering, right?

01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:07.640
It's an ennobling enterprise love.

01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:11.840
And so the therapeutic process aims at love and uses truth.

01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:14.000
And that's a religious enterprise.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.600
It's a logos enterprise.

01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:17.600
It's a dialogical enterprise.

01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:21.040
And it's a form of secularized religious practice.

01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:23.840
So one last question.

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:24.840
I know you're doing things.

01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:26.600
You're you go all over the world.

01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:29.400
You got friends and fans everywhere.

01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:32.080
You started in some kind of organization.

01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:36.800
My last question is, how are you going to save the world?

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:40.440
One person at a time.

01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:42.000
Right, that's always how it's happened.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.920
You know, what's the leftist mantra?

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:45.960
The long march through the institutions.

01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:49.280
Well, how do you combat that with the longer

01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:52.280
march through the individuals, right?

01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:55.760
There's the rest of it's an illusion in a way.

01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:59.680
There are individuals, right?

01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:01.800
That's where the rubber hits the road.

01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:04.480
Individuals suffer.

01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:07.280
Individuals bear responsibility, right?

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:12.120
One of the one of the gifts, I suppose, that

01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:16.160
the biblical corpus gave to the UK,

01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:20.480
the UK transformed into political wisdom and transmitted to the US

01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:23.920
was the proposition that the individual was the proper

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:27.400
unit of analysis, the fundamental unit of analysis.

01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:30.000
And I believe that that's the case, which is why I'm a psychologist,

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:34.600
as I said, and not a sociologist or a political operative.

01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:37.760
It's it's the the road.

01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:42.720
It's it's always been the case that the route to heaven and away from hell

01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:45.240
is the root of the individual soul.

01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:50.040
And I believe that that's it's theologically true.

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:51.200
It's metaphysically true.

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:53.320
It's philosophically true.

01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:57.280
I also believe that it's materially true, right?

01:01:57.320 --> 01:02:01.440
Insofar as that sort of truth can be instantiated materially.

01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:03.240
It's true at every level, simultaneous.

01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:06.000
In agreeing with that, I will say

01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:09.960
all of the greatest philosopher, political philosophers

01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:13.520
and all of the greatest greatest statesmen thought precisely that

01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:19.280
the purpose of the nation or the regime is the happiness of its people.

01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:23.800
And they come together to help make it, but each has to make his own.

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:27.560
And that I think that's a very beautiful way.

01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:29.960
That's how the founders of America organized the country.

01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:33.160
And my own view is.

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:38.440
Beautiful things cannot abidingly lose their luster.

01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:42.040
And I will say that in our time, which is a desperate time,

01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:47.240
your success and influence is one of the key signs that I'm right about that.

01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:49.560
Thank you for being with me.

01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:52.840
Thank you, sir. It's always a pleasure to be at Hillsdale and to see you.
