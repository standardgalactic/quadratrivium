0	4280	Welcome to the Larry Arn Show on the Hillsdale College podcast network.
4280	9360	I would be Larry Arn, President of Hillsdale College, and I have a great and mighty guest
9360	10360	today.
10360	11760	His name is Jordan Peterson.
11760	19400	Jordan Peterson is a psychologist and an academic, and he's had two careers, I think
19400	21120	it's fair to say.
21120	27160	In one, he taught some at Harvard and whatever he taught later for a long time at University
27160	28600	of Toronto.
28600	33440	And wherever he taught, he leaves a trail behind him of students who love him.
33440	37240	And they testified what it is about him that they love, and you're going to see it for
37240	39160	yourself in a few minutes.
39160	43200	In his second career, it starts when a few years ago, he took stand about something,
43200	52320	which was a law in Canada that would require people change all kinds of things that defy
52320	55240	everything ordinary, gender stuff, mostly.
55240	61160	And he stood up against that, and of course, a firestorm came, and he didn't retreat
61160	62160	into any hole.
62160	64820	He'd never been any good at being in a hole.
64820	66920	He decided to go public.
66920	72520	And what I like about, I admire him very much and know him well, I'm privileged that way,
72520	77880	is that his public career follows the same pattern as his academic career.
77880	84360	He's a teacher, and he's relentless, and he's curious, and he knows a lot of stuff.
84480	88720	And he teaches people, and they are grateful, except for the ones who don't want teaching
88720	93360	to happen, and they are enraged, and he's courageous in the face of that.
93360	95480	Welcome, Jordan Peterson.
95480	96560	Thank you, sir.
96560	101120	Because you're a teacher, and because I'm curious about it, I want to talk about psychology,
101120	103240	about what it is.
103240	108600	And I know that you like Carl Jung, and because of that, I never did without knowing much
108600	109600	about him.
109600	114160	I've been reading up on him some, and I want you to explain the general thing.
114160	119880	What is the discipline of psychology, and then something about him, if you care to say?
119880	124920	Well, we all exist at multiple levels simultaneously.
124920	132360	We exist at subatomic level, and the atomic level, and the molecular level, and the level
132360	138960	of organs, and the level of our body, and we have motivational systems, and emotional
139000	148000	systems, and cognitive systems, and perceptual systems, and psychology is the study of the
148000	154680	integration of all of those subordinate levels into the individual.
154680	159400	So you can study all those levels, right up to the level of the individual, and you're
159400	164480	in the domain of psychology, and so I like that integrative function of psychology.
164480	171760	And so when I was in graduate school in particular, the PhD work I did was really quite biological.
171760	177640	I was looking at the genetic, the psychological manifestations of the genetic predisposition
177640	184880	to alcoholism and antisocial behavior, and alcohol is a pharmacological agent, and it
184880	188720	spreads through the brain like water, because it crosses the blood-brain barrier, it's one
188720	191000	of the few chemicals that can do that.
191000	196920	And so to study alcohol's effect on psychology, you have to study alcohol's effect on the
196920	202520	brain, but it affects every bit of the brain, and every bit of the brain is quite a lot
202520	203520	to study.
203520	210240	And so as I was studying alcoholism and the predisposition to alcoholism, I was simultaneously
210240	215360	studying how the brain works to understand how alcohol and other drugs changed its function.
215360	220840	And that got me deep into the study of neuroscience, and affect of neuroscience in particular
220840	223680	that's the neuroscience of emotion and motivation.
223680	228560	And that was a burgeoning field at the time, and I read some of the great early classic
228560	234600	works in that field, and at the same time I was reading a lot of work on the clinical
234600	239360	front, great clinicians, including the people you mentioned, Freud and Jung, and I was integrating
239360	243480	across those, which was something that hadn't been done.
243480	249160	And my first book, Maps of Meaning, was an attempt to integrate across all those levels
249160	254320	from the biological to the narrative, that's a good way of thinking about it.
254320	258480	Jung, do you call yourself a Jungian?
258480	260200	To some degree, yes.
260200	263520	I don't describe myself that way, but it's definitely the case.
263520	272400	I mean, I started reading Freud before I read Jung, and I liked Freud a lot for a variety
272400	275000	of reasons.
275000	280320	So we could go back to Nietzsche to explain this more properly.
280320	285000	So Nietzsche, back in the late 1800s, announced that God was dead.
285000	292320	And what he meant by that, essentially, was that the unity of conception that had brought
292320	297160	us together psychologically and socially was disintegrating.
297160	300200	And Nietzsche knew what the consequence of that would be.
300200	305360	He knew that the consequence of that would be nihilism and hopelessness on the one hand
305360	309200	and a turn towards totalitarian certainties on the other.
309200	310200	He nailed that.
310200	312400	Dostoevsky knew the same thing.
312400	316800	And Nietzsche saw a way out, he thought, and his way out was that human beings would have
316800	322520	to become, they would have to adopt the mien of what they had deposed.
322520	327800	And so he thought that people would have to become gods in some way, and that we could
327800	332440	do that by creating our own values, that we would have to take it upon ourselves to
332440	336320	create our own values, since they were no longer handed down on high from some transcendent
336320	337480	source.
337480	343240	And all of the arguments that Nietzsche laid out were very powerful, including that one.
343240	350440	But reading Freud helped me understand why Nietzsche was wrong, because Freud noted more
350440	355240	clearly than anyone else, at least at that time, that we were not the masters in our
355240	362880	own houses, and that the notion that we could produce our own values was predicated on an
362880	369520	assumption that in some manner we were intrinsically unitary masters of our own destiny, our own
369520	372440	cognition, our own perceptions, our own emotional states.
372440	374400	And Freud really flipped that on its head.
374400	379600	He said, no, we're more like a haunted house full of autonomous spirits.
379600	385000	And those spirits have, those would be complexes in the psychoanalytic term, and those complexes,
385000	391520	those autonomous spirits, some of which are motivational forces, let's say, or emotional
391520	392760	systems.
392760	397440	They have an autonomy and a will that can easily supersede our own.
397440	402560	And so it isn't obvious at all that because we're masters of, not masters in our own
402560	406360	house, that we can in any way create our own values.
406360	416320	And Freud, I think the weakness of Freud, was that he pronounced one motivational system
416320	418440	superordinate sex.
418440	426760	And you could say with some real truth that Freud replaced the god of his ancestors, Yahweh.
426760	427760	Freud was Jewish.
427760	434840	He replaced the god of his ancestors with sexuality and put that at the pinnacle of
434840	437600	the human psychological hierarchy.
437600	443760	And Jung, who was a student of Freud's, although also a student of Nietzsche's, and perhaps
443760	446520	more deeply a student of Nietzsche's, objected to that.
446520	455280	He did not believe that it was appropriate to make the presumption that sex ruled overall.
455280	460640	And I read a lot of Jung, especially when I was in graduate school, I think he had,
460640	463200	I think there's 20 volumes in his collected work, something like that.
463200	464840	I read every single one of them.
464840	466720	And I didn't just read them.
466720	469160	I actually understood them, and that took a lot of work.
469160	473040	I read Archetypes of the Collective Unconscious, it was the first book by Jung I wrote.
473040	478160	I read, little Freudian slip there.
478160	481840	I read it three times before I knew what the hell he was talking about.
481840	486760	Because what Jung is talking about is so strange that it's almost impenetrable.
486760	489360	And then when you do penetrate it, it's terrifying.
489360	491280	That's why psychologists don't like Jung.
491280	493000	That's why people in general don't.
493000	494720	It's like, he's very hard to understand.
494720	497760	Then when you do understand him, he's very, very terrifying.
497760	503120	Because Freud made the case that we were haunted by ghosts, and Jung made the case that we
503120	507120	were haunted by demons and gods, and that's much more accurate.
507120	510120	And when you start to understand that, man, the world is not the same.
510120	512600	It is seriously not the same.
512600	518400	So we're going to talk about sex today, because that's all over the place.
518400	526000	What are estrangement from and fascination with sex today have to do with Freud?
526000	533360	It has to do with what Freud observed, and Freud was correct in that sex is a dominating
533360	534360	force.
534360	539960	Nietzsche said, every drive attempts to philosophize in its spirit, brilliant, brilliant aphorism.
539960	541160	He was really something.
541440	549080	When the world collapses into materialist atheism, let's say, it's highly likely that
549080	554520	sex will arise as the dominant goddess, likely goddess.
554520	559440	It's likely on the feminine side more accurately, if you think about it historically.
559440	562840	Now did Freud bring that about?
562840	570320	Partly because Freud made the case that there was no metaphysical reality, let's say.
570320	575040	There were biological realities, and that the prime biological reality was that of sex.
575040	580720	And so he laid some of the groundwork for those metaphysical claims.
580720	589840	But Freud, to speak in Freud's defense, even though he believed that sex was a dominating
589840	594480	force, it isn't clear at all that he believed that it should be.
594480	599640	Now if you pushed Freud, and what he thought should be at the pinnacle of the moral hierarchy,
600400	604600	he would say something like, the ability to work and play.
604600	606680	And that's not bad.
606680	608080	That's not too bad.
608080	612160	And he had a wisdom, and Freud was also a very practical clinician.
612160	619760	But he also viewed, see, Freud was deeply anti-religious in the Enlightenment tradition.
619760	626960	And he told Jung at one point that it was necessary to make of the doctrine of sexual
626960	632440	motivation an unshakable bulwark against a black tide of occultism.
632440	637840	And it's an interesting phrase because there was a black tide of occultism coming, and
637840	641280	we've certainly seen that unfold over the course of the 20th century.
641280	650720	But it also highlights one of Freud's metaphysical weaknesses, and it was the weakness that separated
650720	652760	Jung from Freud.
652760	661640	And that was that Freud's materialist, deterministic atheism made him incapable of contending with
661640	669200	the realities of the religious world properly, and that undermined his, what would you say,
669200	673840	his ability to sit at the proper pinnacle of the psychoanalytic hierarchy.
673840	680120	So Jung believed, like Jung believed that he had a conception that he put forward as
680120	687760	the self, and the self is you, is the four dimensional you.
687760	689280	And so why four dimensions?
689280	697040	Well, because here you are now in this room at this time, but you are something that extends
697040	705240	across time from birth till death, and the totality of you is that entire being is stretched
705240	706920	across time.
706920	711160	And Jung's self is the four dimensional totality of the person.
711160	716200	Jung was a very sophisticated thinker, and he believed that Christ was a symbol of the
716200	717200	self.
717200	723320	Now, what Jung believed religiously, that's a very difficult thing to put your finger
723320	727360	on because he was a very sophisticated thinker.
727360	734160	I would put him firmly in the Christian camp, but he's not a normal Christian by any stretch
734160	736640	of the imagination.
736640	741760	When he says something like Christ is a symbol of the self, he meant something very deep.
741760	750120	He meant that, well, he meant, for example, that at the highest level of conceptualization,
750120	757080	the human being is something doomed to suffer through death and hell and to emerge reborn.
757080	762080	And he really believed that, and not in the way that you believe something preposterous
762360	767800	because it's an element of faith, but because he saw that as the deepest form of wisdom,
767800	771200	and he also saw it as something that was inevitably true.
771200	773000	The soul is by nature Christian.
773000	775600	That was certainly something Jung believed.
775600	781720	Now let's try to relate that, because something amazing is going on in the world.
781720	787120	We are trying to transform ourselves into whatever we want to be, sexual and everything
787120	788120	else.
788120	789920	And you've taken a stand against that.
789920	797040	I'd like you to apply, and also, what in psychology has led you to do that?
797040	804160	When you say, so, there's a battle right now going on in our culture about self-definition.
804160	809320	I am whatever I say I am, which is, by the way, what God said to Moses when he proclaimed
809320	815440	his identity, and that's not a trivial comment on what's happening now.
815440	819280	Jung believed that the logical conclusion of Protestantism was that everyone would become
819280	822320	their own church.
822320	827640	When Jung said something, he meant it, like all the way down, and so the logical conclusion
827640	832280	of you being your own church is that you're your own God, and that you get to define yourself.
832280	837520	And you might say, well, why can't I define myself, and the right answer is, what the
837520	840280	hell do you know about who you are?
840280	844600	And you think that there's something in you that's yourself that's defining you, but
844600	848520	how do you know you're not just a pawn of that thing you think is yourself?
848520	853680	And so the fatal weakness on the self-definition front is, oh, I see, you're gripped so firmly
853680	859760	by your sexuality that your sexuality now proclaims that it's you, and you believe that.
859760	860960	And you think that's you.
860960	867400	You don't think that you're worshiping a polytheistic pagan goddess, or that she's got you in her
867400	868400	grip.
868400	874080	You think that's you because you have an intrinsic theory of yourself, and your theory of yourself
874080	878760	is whatever you want hedonistically in this moment rules, everyone, including you, and
878760	879880	that's right.
879880	883600	And that everyone who opposes that is nothing but a demon, essentially.
883600	888960	And that means everybody who opposes that doesn't get the same favor.
888960	891440	They can't define themselves the way they want.
891440	896240	Well, that's the incoherence problem, but the radical types, the narcissistic radical
896240	899480	types, they don't give a damn about incoherence because what they give a damn about is that
899480	901880	they get to do exactly what the hell they want.
901880	904880	With whoever they want this moment.
904880	905880	And if that's...
905880	911040	Now, this is where the rubber meets the road, you might say, well, what's the problem with
911040	912040	that?
912040	915840	It's like, why can't I just do whatever the hell I want whenever the hell I want to do
915840	917920	it with whoever I want to do it with?
917920	923080	And the answer is, because everything goes to hell if you do that, including you.
923080	924520	And you say, well, I don't believe in hell.
924520	930000	And I say, well, keep acting the way you are, and you will, right?
930000	931000	For sure.
931120	935720	One with an ounce of sense, an iota of sense, and this is actually what defines sense knows
935720	937240	perfectly well.
937240	942240	If they only do exactly what they want to do in accordance with the whim of the moment,
942240	944080	which then becomes their God, right?
944080	948500	Because if you're motivated by the whim of the moment and you place that above all else,
948500	949760	that is now your God.
949760	950960	Well, what's the God?
950960	953280	Well, in this case, let's say it's sexual motivation.
953280	958180	Well, if sexual motivation is your God, you will end up in something indistinguishable
958180	963540	from hell because you will, you will misuse other people, you will make them objects of
963540	969540	your own narrow and immediate desire, and you'll have no relationships.
969540	972420	You'll exploit everyone, including yourself.
972420	974460	And there's that's no way to live.
974460	975900	Well, why is that no way to live?
975900	976900	You're just moralizing.
976900	980860	It's like, no, live like that for two years and find out what happens.
980860	985460	No one with any sense will want to be within 20 feet of you.
985460	989940	And that's because you'll do nothing but exploit, including, and the thing you'll exploit will
989940	996260	include that higher self whose existence you don't, you don't even imagine, right?
996260	1001100	Because you've already subjugated yourself to the immediacy of your idiot whim.
1001100	1005140	And the people who identify themselves on sexual grounds do that all the time.
1005140	1008580	My paramount feature is who I'm sexually attracted to.
1008580	1010340	It's really, that's your paramount feature.
1010340	1011340	Is it?
1011340	1013060	That's your definition of your intrinsic self.
1013060	1018340	To call you primitive is an insult to primitive people.
1018340	1025500	If so, I want to suggest what's been swept away by all this.
1025500	1031100	In the classic philosophy, in most philosophies since then, the idea was we have a nature.
1031100	1032700	Everything has a nature.
1032700	1037820	And the nature and our happiness and well-being depends upon fulfilling our nature.
1037820	1041700	My little bit of reading of Young suggested he thought roughly like that.
1041700	1045940	In other words, if he was going to give somebody therapy, he tried to help him become a better
1045940	1048300	person like a person would be.
1048300	1053220	Well, that word nature is interesting because it comes from a Latin word that means birth.
1053220	1057140	It means the process of beginning and growth by which we come to be.
1057140	1064380	Well, if you lose your nature, then you have no purpose outside your own will.
1064380	1071260	And now my question, you've been particularly helpful and popular with men, young men especially.
1071820	1073820	Why is that, do you think?
1073820	1078740	Well, you can't lose your nature exactly.
1078740	1083460	You can lose your higher order, integrated, purpose-driven nature.
1083460	1089700	Here's some natures you won't lose, pain, anxiety.
1089700	1096500	You can lose your higher nature all you want and all of the negative elements of your nature
1096500	1098220	will predominate.
1098220	1101900	And you're not going to rationalize yourself out of pain and anxiety.
1101900	1105580	This is the thing about those who believe life has no meaning.
1105580	1111100	It's like, I see, so you think you can argue yourself out of your pain because pain is
1111100	1112100	a meaning.
1112100	1115260	Now, you might say, well, it's not a meaning I want to pursue.
1115260	1117700	What does that have to do with anything?
1117700	1120140	Pain is an undeniable reality.
1120140	1127580	Well, if you allow your higher order self to disintegrate, you disintegrate into a landscape
1127580	1131340	characterized by pain, anxiety, and hopelessness.
1131340	1134820	That's the metaphysical desert, by the way.
1134820	1144380	That's the place you end up devolving into when your tyrannical presuppositions are disintegrate,
1144380	1149340	which is why people cling to their tyrannical presuppositions because there's a mystery.
1149340	1154300	Well, you don't want to end up in the landscape of pain, anxiety, and hopelessness.
1154300	1159900	And I actually mean that technically because what happens when you lose direction, the
1159900	1165140	biological systems that mediate negative emotion signal loss of direction.
1165140	1166140	That's what anxiety is.
1166140	1167940	It's a signal of loss of direction.
1167940	1170900	So if you lose higher order direction, you become anxious.
1170900	1175260	Well, and you can argue with anxiety, all you want with your atheistic nihilism, but
1175260	1178340	it isn't going to go away and neither is your pain.
1178340	1183620	And so one of the things I've told my audiences is, you have to be a fool if you doubt the
1183620	1187860	reality of pain and anxiety, pain and terror, let's say.
1187860	1188860	Are they real?
1188860	1192540	It's like, well, of course, that's an ontological argument.
1192540	1195940	They're real enough so you'll act like they're real if they come knocking.
1195940	1201820	So maybe we can satisfy ourselves with that proclamation.
1201820	1205740	And you say, well, are they the ultimate reality, pain and suffering?
1205740	1207240	And that's a good question.
1207240	1208240	That's a tough question.
1208240	1216040	And I would say, no, the things that transcend pain and suffering are more real than pain
1216040	1217040	and suffering.
1217040	1220340	Well, what transcends suffering?
1220340	1229200	The eternal verities transcend suffering and the higher order nature of man is the antidote
1229200	1231200	to catastrophic suffering.
1231200	1232680	It's the antithesis of hell.
1232680	1234080	Well, what is that?
1234080	1235080	Is that real?
1235080	1239720	Well, if pain and suffering are real, and if you can transcend them through allegiance
1239720	1244280	with a higher order self, well, then the higher order self is obviously not only real, but
1244280	1245280	more real.
1245280	1246480	Well, what is that?
1246480	1250280	Well, this is why Jung said Christ was a symbol of the self.
1250280	1253800	How do you transcend the eternal realm of suffering?
1253800	1255120	How do you escape from hell?
1255120	1257020	It's the same question.
1257020	1260800	How about voluntary self-sacrifice?
1260800	1261800	How about that?
1262520	1265600	Well, that's absolutely no different than the image of the crucifix.
1265600	1267160	Those are the same thing.
1267160	1273560	Well, why does the spirit of voluntary self-sacrifice protect you against suffering?
1273560	1281200	Well, I need to sacrifice my idiot whims in the moment to serve that element of me that
1281200	1283600	is continuous across time.
1283600	1288440	This is like Kant's categorical imperative in some ways.
1288440	1296320	If I'm wise and mature, then I don't make decisions now that will cost me tomorrow or
1296320	1300120	next week or next month or next year or five years down the road.
1300120	1306560	I contemplate my extended self, which is like a community across time, and I bind my decisions
1306560	1310920	in the present by my covenant with my future self.
1310920	1313000	And there's no difference between doing that.
1313000	1320680	That means I sacrifice my the whims of the moment to the optimization of the medium and
1320680	1321960	long run.
1321960	1324080	And I do the same thing in relationship to other people.
1324080	1325080	Those are the same thing.
1325080	1326440	There is no difference.
1326440	1329040	This is a gospel equation in some ways.
1329040	1332880	There is no difference between treating you properly and treating myself properly.
1332880	1336920	And that's because in the final analysis, there's actually no difference between you
1336920	1339960	and me, not fundamentally.
1339960	1346200	The classic American account for most of our history is that's because we're the same kind
1346200	1347200	of thing.
1347200	1350400	We're equal in what way are we equal?
1350400	1358040	We're equal in our natures, and the troubled part comes this way.
1358040	1365400	If our natures include how we come to be, then the differences between the sexes are
1365400	1371760	also part of our rights and also, therefore, our obligations.
1371760	1376640	And that's what you're telling me this morning about a law that's proceeding in Ireland,
1376640	1384080	and they're going to make it illegal to possess books that claim that sex is an innate feature
1384080	1385720	or that you don't get to choose your own.
1385720	1386720	Is that what it is?
1386720	1387720	That's part of it.
1387720	1388720	Yeah.
1388720	1389720	Yeah.
1389720	1390720	Well, it depends on how they define.
1390720	1397240	But it depends on how they end up defining hate speech, but that's already built into
1397240	1403840	the law, the idea that making a distinction between men and women that's categorical,
1403840	1405480	that's already part of hate speech.
1405480	1406480	Yeah.
1406480	1407480	Yeah.
1407480	1412200	Well, it is in part outsprings.
1412200	1415040	This is, again, where you see the weakness in Nietzsche's argument.
1415040	1417560	Well, here's the values we've created.
1417560	1420440	Well, that's not a very good replacement for God.
1420440	1426480	Our replacement for God is narcissistic radicals get to do whatever the hell they want, whenever
1426480	1428160	they want, all the time.
1428160	1431240	And if you oppose it, then it's prison for you.
1431240	1436560	Well, that's not much of a substitute for what we had before.
1436560	1444520	And that was our, I went to the church of the Holy Sepulcher in Rome, and that was the
1444520	1447560	first established church.
1447560	1451520	And it became the model for European society.
1451520	1456800	So it's so interesting the way these conceptions are laid out, let's say, architecturally rather
1456800	1458520	than conceptually.
1458520	1464360	So at the very center, you have the crucifix, the cross, and that's what would you say?
1464360	1469440	That's the point where all of reality comes to a point.
1469440	1472760	And it's the point of maximal suffering, and it's more than that.
1472800	1476320	It's the point of voluntarily accepted maximal suffering.
1476320	1481600	And the notion is that that's a sacrifice.
1481600	1482840	Why is it a sacrifice?
1482840	1489760	You have to sacrifice, you have to sacrifice your lower self to your higher self in order
1489760	1495680	for you to proceed in a healthy manner to be resilient, but also for you to participate
1495680	1499040	in the covenant that would make for a united society.
1499520	1504520	There's no difference between that maturation, because a lot of what maturation is, is to
1504520	1510320	give up the attractions of the immediate present in the service of something broader
1510320	1511320	and higher.
1511320	1515360	And that would be you in the broader sense, and what's in your best interest, but also
1515360	1517240	the community simultaneously.
1517240	1519080	Those are the same thing.
1519080	1523360	So at the center of the community, you have the sacrifice, the voluntary sacrifice of
1523360	1524360	self.
1524360	1525360	That's the center.
1525360	1529720	You have the church, you have the altar, then you have the church, then you have the town,
1529720	1533040	and around the town you have the state, and then you have the nation.
1533040	1537920	And that's all resting on this spirit of voluntary self-sacrifice, right?
1537920	1541160	And that's the foundation stone of the community.
1541160	1545120	Jung knew that, Jung knew that, and Freud didn't.
1545120	1551120	And because Freud was, he was a materialistic, deterministic atheist of the 19th century,
1551120	1553240	and Jung is a 20th century thinker.
1553240	1555640	Maybe he's a 21st century thinker, even.
1555640	1557120	That's certainly possible.
1557120	1563480	So Churchill said, he wrote once in a book called My Early Life, you must nail your life
1563480	1566440	to a cross of thought or action.
1566440	1571880	Now he ended up doing both, but in other case, whichever way you go, and so you could say,
1571880	1577760	in your life, Jordan Peterson, it was more thought in the beginning, and it might be
1577760	1581960	more action now, but in other case, it's a cross.
1581960	1584200	How do you think of it?
1584200	1589000	Well, you can either lift up a cross or have one dropped on you, right?
1589000	1592320	There's no non-cross option in this world.
1592320	1595720	And that's really worth knowing too, and I tell my audiences that consistently.
1595720	1603280	It's like, you all know perfectly well that your idiot hedonism, your idiot immature hedonism
1603280	1606680	is going to vanish in a puff of smoke at the first sign of trouble.
1606680	1610240	You know that, and you know that it's thin, gruel.
1610240	1613800	That's why you're hedonistic and hopeless at the same time.
1613800	1614840	You know that.
1614840	1617080	You need something beyond that.
1617080	1618080	Why?
1618080	1624400	Because life in some ways is unbearable, and so you need something worth bearing to make
1624400	1629800	it bearable, and life is very heavy load, and so that means you have to carry something
1629800	1632560	very heavy to justify it.
1632560	1637160	Now, I see this in the biblical corpus, for example, quite clearly laid out in the story
1637160	1639080	of Abraham, which is a very interesting story.
1639080	1644920	Of course, Abraham is the founder of nations, and so you might say, well, is that true?
1644920	1648360	It's like, those are such stupid questions.
1648360	1650360	That's such a stupid question.
1650360	1652080	It's a definition in this story.
1652080	1660280	So the definition is the spirit of Abraham is the founder of nations, right?
1660280	1664800	That's the declaration of the story, and you're to come to understand that when you read the
1664800	1665800	story.
1666160	1669640	Now, you might say, well, what did the people who wrote the story mean by that?
1669640	1674280	And the answer is, well, they didn't know, and that's why they wrote the story.
1674280	1676120	Like the story is the explanation.
1676120	1678160	Okay, so what's the story?
1678160	1684720	Well, Abraham is a human being, and that means he's like a natural human being, and that
1684720	1688000	means he's useless and lazy.
1688000	1691520	And if he can have it easy, he will.
1691520	1695320	And so Abraham is like the first case of white privilege.
1695320	1696560	He's a good joke.
1696560	1697560	He's rich.
1697560	1702200	His parents are rich, and he can just lay around his tent all day and eat peeled grapes
1702200	1707240	and have like beautiful slave women wave palm fronds over him and do nothing.
1707240	1711120	And he does that for like 83 years.
1711120	1714240	And then one day a voice comes to him, right, a spirit.
1714240	1717440	He's inspired by a spirit.
1717440	1719400	And what's the nature of the spirit?
1719400	1723240	Well, it's the spirit that calls him to adventure.
1723240	1727280	And it says to him, get your lazy ass the hell out of the tent.
1727280	1730080	You're made for more than this.
1730080	1738200	And so Abraham, in a great act of faith, abides by the intuition of this spirit, and he leaves
1738200	1742720	his comfortable infancy, right, because he's an infant.
1742720	1745760	He lives in an infantile utopia.
1745760	1747640	So, right, well, what do I want?
1747640	1751640	Well, I never want to be hungry, and I never want to be thirsty.
1752400	1753760	I never want to be deprived.
1753760	1756560	It's like, well, great, you're an infant sleeping in a crib.
1756560	1757960	You've got infant paradise.
1757960	1759520	Is that what you're made for, right?
1759520	1762560	The mere cessation of your needs.
1762560	1764360	That's your vision of utopia, is it?
1764360	1766560	Well, that was Abraham's vision of utopia.
1766560	1770880	And a counter spirit came along and said, get your lazy ass the hell out of your tent
1770880	1772520	and get out there in the world.
1772520	1774680	And of course, it's a complete catastrophe, right?
1774680	1782600	Like, he faces tyranny and war and the necessary sacrifice of his son and collusion among the
1782600	1788600	aristocrats to steal his wife, and, like, it's just a disaster in 10 different directions.
1788600	1790120	But it's an adventure.
1790120	1792440	It's an adventure, right?
1792440	1794600	And so what's life?
1794600	1797280	Is it hedonistic, infantile bliss?
1797280	1800720	This is something Dostoyevsky objected to, or is it a romantic adventure?
1800720	1804320	Well, what do people go watch when they go see a movie?
1804320	1805880	They watch a romantic adventure.
1805880	1806880	Well, why?
1806880	1808360	Because that's what they want in their life.
1808360	1815120	They don't want peace and tranquility and guaranteed basic income and the pleasures of
1815120	1818480	infantile, gratified infantile dependence.
1818480	1820400	They want a bloody adventure.
1820400	1824480	And if they don't get a real adventure, they'll take a false one and wreak havoc.
1824480	1827360	And we have no shortage of false adventures in our culture.
1827360	1833440	So the woke culture and the transgender movement and all these great things that have come
1833440	1837960	upon us so hard, are they going to suppress that for people?
1837960	1839720	You're not going to get to have your adventure.
1839720	1840720	You're going to have to...
1840720	1845200	Well, they put forward a false adventure, and the false adventure is wave a placard
1845200	1846680	and save the world.
1846680	1847680	That's right.
1847680	1848680	Great.
1848680	1849680	Isn't that wonderful?
1849680	1854560	All you have to do, you know how I stopped getting protesters to my events at university?
1854560	1857360	I held them in the morning.
1857360	1858360	That's great.
1858360	1859360	No kidding, eh?
1859360	1860360	I'm the Messiah.
1860360	1861360	Yeah, really?
1861360	1865640	Well, as long as you don't want me to get out of bed before noon, yeah.
1865640	1868360	So that's the false adventure sold to young kids.
1868360	1871320	It's like, well, the planet's going to hell in a handbasket.
1871320	1872320	That's the claim.
1872320	1876040	It's like, yeah, yeah, the planet's always been going to hell in a handbasket, right?
1876040	1881120	The apocalypse is always nigh, and that's because we die and so does everything else.
1881120	1886880	And so, well, the apocalypse is nigh, and you can save the world by protesting against
1886880	1888520	those who are at fault.
1888520	1890920	That's what universities sell young people.
1890920	1892440	Well, it's an adventure, right?
1892440	1897680	They have a messianic urge at that age, and that really never goes away in people in some
1897680	1902840	fundamental sense, but it's particularly acute when late adolescents are trying to catalyze
1902840	1906600	their identity, and the left offers these false adventures.
1906600	1914440	You print out a sign that says, I oppose poverty as if anyone doesn't, and you wave that around
1914440	1917040	publicly, which is the same as praying in public, right?
1917040	1918280	It's a great sin.
1918280	1922640	And you proclaim your moral virtue, and bang, that's your adventure.
1922640	1927920	And it's a cheap pathway to reputational accomplishment.
1927920	1932280	And part of the reason young guys do it, you know perfectly well, is because they're trying
1932280	1941960	to impress young women, and it's kind of, what would you say, there's a surface attraction
1941960	1949240	to being a kind of rebellious quasi-shea guavara type, and to be taking on the evil corporations
1949240	1956480	of the world when you're 18, you know, instead of working at 7-Eleven and handing out sugar
1956480	1957480	water to kids.
1957480	1964720	Do you think that there's something that young people really need that will ultimately redeem
1964720	1968360	them from this, enough of them at least, to save the world?
1968360	1969360	Do you think that...
1969360	1970360	They need a burden.
1970360	1971360	They need a burden.
1971760	1972360	Absolutely.
1972360	1973360	And they want one, you're saying.
1973360	1974360	You get, absolutely.
1974360	1978800	Well, and you can explain that to them in some ways the way I just explained it.
1978800	1984160	It's like, look, guys, you're going to suffer, and most of them are already suffering, so
1984160	1985160	they know that.
1985160	1988960	It's like, and do you want to suffer stupidly too?
1988960	1990680	Because that's even worse.
1990680	1995920	And then do you want to contemplate for a moment what's going to be your arc when the
1995920	1996920	storms come?
1996920	2000520	Well, I can tell you what it is, and you already know this because you've consulted your own
2000560	2001560	conscience.
2001560	2004920	When you're awake at 3 in the morning thinking about what a useless bastard you are, how
2004920	2008960	many sins you have on your conscience, if you're fortunate, there'll be a few of your
2008960	2015000	adventures come to mind where you think, well, you know, I didn't do so bad then.
2015000	2017800	You know, maybe there's something to me.
2017800	2021620	And so what do people remember when they have those memories?
2021620	2025480	They remember the times when they stepped outside of their narrow cells and took on
2025480	2029080	some bloody responsibility, at least for themselves.
2029080	2035080	And then maybe for someone else too, and then maybe for a lot of other people.
2035080	2041200	And so if you tell young man, look, you're going to find the meaning in your life by
2041200	2047440	adopting maximal responsibility, right?
2047440	2050780	That's going to be extremely difficult because you're so bloody useless.
2050780	2055760	You can't even get your own house in order, and you're going to be called upon not only
2055760	2060040	to get your house in order, but to do that well enough so some woman can stand having
2060040	2064240	you around for more than like 15 minutes in the back of a car.
2064240	2068040	And then maybe you're going to have to do it so that you could be a good father to a
2068040	2070560	family and a pillar of the community.
2070560	2072360	And that's not just empty words.
2072360	2077600	Like if you do that nobly, there'll be something to you.
2077600	2084240	And then when the storms come, you won't be blown over by the first four foot wave.
2084240	2089880	And young men think, huh, I mean, I could be something that wasn't blown over by the
2089880	2091720	first four foot wave.
2091720	2097280	They think, oh, well, that's, that's, that's inspiring.
2097280	2100720	Maybe that's worth doing a little work towards it on the off chance.
2100720	2102640	It might be true.
2102640	2105480	And the thing about it is, it is true.
2105480	2110400	So it's not that difficult once you understand it to make a case for it.
2110400	2111400	It's true.
2111400	2117120	And it is also true that you grow in proportion to the weight you take on voluntarily.
2117120	2121560	And it's also true that we have no idea what the upper limit to that is, right?
2121560	2125800	So, you know, you, you've met remarkable people in your life.
2125800	2127740	People can do remarkable things.
2127740	2132220	And there are inevitably people who take, who took on remarkable burdens.
2132220	2136720	And because they did that, their development was forced by necessity.
2136720	2141960	They were forced by necessity to grow beyond what they were.
2141960	2144840	And who knows what the limit to that is.
2144840	2149800	People, so something I see in the college business, our college, Schillstock College,
2149800	2153680	has got about the same number of boys and girls, a few more boys.
2153680	2158920	And they come from a pool of applicants that are equal size and equal qualification.
2158920	2160840	Almost nobody has that.
2160840	2165840	And the boys do just about as well as the girls, although they do get into contests
2165880	2169800	doing things like throwing deer urine on each other and stuff, they've done that.
2169800	2171880	But some of the best boys I've ever met have done that.
2171880	2175200	As a matter of fact, they're in the Marine Corps now, stupid boys.
2175200	2182320	And they, and, and the thing is, people will say, how are you successful with boys?
2182320	2186960	And I say, we treat them like boys, you know, they want to be treated like boys.
2186960	2193440	They, and, and girls, women, we've always had boys and girls here, women and men here, right?
2193440	2194720	And they've always done well.
2194720	2199560	And their intellectual capacities are, you know, they're the same kind of thing.
2199560	2204800	And their physical paths are not the same.
2204800	2208320	And they can wish them the same if they want to.
2208320	2211080	But, but they don't.
2211080	2212480	No, really, they don't.
2212480	2219120	I mean, I, you know what I find is, and, and, you know, I have two daughters.
2219120	2226520	You have one, I think, and she's, your daughter is like my daughter's very tough, very assertive,
2226520	2228520	very womanly, you see.
2228520	2236560	And so in other words, the classic account is they're good at being what they are.
2236560	2241280	And that's a service, you know, human above all, but also male or female.
2241280	2245440	And that's a service that burden you're talking about.
2245480	2250720	The first burden everyone carries is, how do you become a good one of these?
2250720	2256000	And by, if by thinking it, that's all.
2256000	2258520	As you say, that's no burden.
2258520	2261360	So no satisfaction.
2261360	2263240	How do you think?
2263240	2265600	Predict the future for me a little bit.
2265600	2267840	What's, what's going to happen?
2267840	2269520	Seems to me things are coming to a point.
2269520	2272160	Do you think so?
2272200	2276480	Yeah, well, I think things have always been coming to a point, but they're coming to a
2276480	2278800	point way faster.
2278800	2283680	And I mean, that's partly a consequence of the technological revolution.
2283680	2288080	I mean, we know that, well, we have Moore's law, right?
2288080	2290880	Computing power doubles every 18 months.
2290880	2293160	It's like, no, no, you don't understand.
2293160	2296720	Computing power doubles every 18 months.
2296720	2298440	That's not some casual phrase.
2298440	2303040	That's an absolute bloody revolution in every possible direction.
2303040	2304560	And it's not just computing power.
2304560	2305560	It's storage power.
2305560	2308160	And there's all sorts of doublings take taking place.
2308160	2313480	And we're now at the point in, in the course of technological pro progress, where those
2313480	2317840	doublings are happening multiple times within the span of a single life.
2317840	2319000	And so it's pretty obvious.
2319000	2323000	And that means the ancient archetypal battles are accelerating.
2323000	2324560	That's exactly what it means.
2324560	2327400	The battles between good and evil is accelerating.
2327440	2329120	And it's always been there.
2329120	2330920	Is the apocalypse nigh?
2330920	2334680	It's like, well, it's always been nigh, but it might be a little more nigh than it
2334680	2336160	has been in the past.
2336160	2338400	You've been talking about artificial intelligence.
2338400	2342320	And recently I have become more concerned about that.
2342320	2345120	What are your concerns and what are your hopes for it?
2345120	2348920	Well, I suppose my fundamental concern is that we'll automate a super intelligent
2348920	2350680	tyranny, right?
2350680	2352720	And I mean, that's not a concern that's limited to me.
2352720	2358280	That's the, that's the motif of endless numbers of science fiction dystopias.
2358280	2363680	And, you know, science fiction is where you, where engineers dream, right?
2363680	2368320	And sometimes it's where they have their nightmares and engineers are notoriously
2368320	2369320	atheistic.
2369320	2373240	And so they turn to worship of Star Wars, for example, as an alternative.
2373240	2379600	But their nightmares and dreams are in the popular culture, in popular imagination.
2379640	2382600	And dystopian science fiction is the nightmare of engineers.
2382600	2386920	And the nightmare of tower of babble building engineers is that we'll automate
2386920	2390120	a super intelligent tyranny.
2390120	2392520	Chinese are hell bent on doing that.
2392520	2393840	They're doing it at the moment.
2393840	2395400	Could we do it here?
2395400	2396320	Absolutely.
2396320	2397560	Are we?
2397560	2398680	Yeah.
2398680	2402120	Will it, will, will that dominate?
2402120	2403760	We'll see.
2403760	2407840	You know, my sense, and I learned a fair bit of this from Jung, but, you know, what
2407960	2414280	one of the things I learned from Jung was that deeply was that salvation, redemption,
2414280	2418440	was an individual enterprise, which is why I'm a psychologist and not a politician,
2418440	2420160	because I believe that to be true.
2420160	2426920	I think that hell is, what would you say, kept at bay one person at a time.
2426920	2430760	And I do believe that people have a divine destiny, let's say.
2430760	2437240	And one of the proper elements of our divine destiny is to keep hell at bay.
2437240	2443680	And you do that by, you do that as a consequence of your choices as an individual.
2443680	2449360	I also believe that every single individual is, is in that up to their necks.
2449360	2452480	You know, Dostoevsky said something very strange at one point.
2452480	2457360	He said, every man is responsible not only for everything he does, but for everyone,
2457360	2459080	everyone else does.
2459080	2460760	And of course, that's insane, right?
2460800	2467760	In that crazy Dostoevsky way that is more sane, that insanity that's more sane than
2467760	2470200	sanity, that's Dostoevsky in a nutshell.
2470200	2475160	And I think there's something true about it is that we each have an archetypal destiny
2475160	2480320	and the fate of the world rests on each person's shoulders, like genuinely.
2480320	2484240	And when I'm traveling around the world talking to people, I'm trying to tell them
2484240	2488280	that's like, no, no, you don't understand, this is up to you.
2488600	2492320	Now, I don't understand how it can be up to you because it's also up to me.
2492720	2497240	And I don't exactly see how it can be equally and finally up to both of us.
2497240	2498640	But that's OK.
2498640	2500720	There's lots of things about the world I don't understand.
2500720	2506680	And I suppose being, what would you say, touched by a spark of divinity, which is,
2506680	2510800	I suppose, what characterizes us, each of us bears an infinite responsibility.
2511440	2515520	And people need to know that and that it's this is no game.
2516400	2519320	So you have to carry the burden for more than your own sake.
2520440	2524560	Well, well, it it you're you're in this dish.
2524560	2528360	You're in this, your sake is indistinguishable from the sake of the totality.
2528560	2530320	See, the Buddha figured this out, right?
2530320	2531880	Because Buddha.
2533840	2534520	What would you say?
2534520	2538000	He he he achieved enlightenment under the bowtree.
2538200	2539200	He was in Nirvana.
2539200	2541840	He was in paradise and he could stay there.
2542360	2543480	That was on the table.
2543520	2546600	And that's a hell of an offer to be able to stay in paradise.
2546840	2547760	And he rejected it.
2547760	2551400	And the reason he rejected it was because in his estimation, any
2551400	2554400	paradise that it didn't include, everyone wasn't the real paradise.
2554840	2559720	And so he left Nirvana to come back to earth, so to speak, to serve as a teacher,
2559720	2562640	to drag everyone else along on the road to Nirvana.
2563000	2564040	And that's.
2565200	2569480	Well, that's that's that's correct, is that that that.
2570480	2574400	It's correct in that they're in the final analysis.
2574400	2577840	There is no distinction between you and someone else.
2578280	2579960	It's a terrible thing to contemplate.
2580600	2581920	They're the same thing.
2582560	2585240	And that's why you're supposed to love your enemy, I suppose.
2585240	2587120	And what does that mean to love your enemy?
2587320	2590440	Well, first of all, it might mean to begin with, to hope that he wouldn't have
2590440	2592760	to be an enemy because why not have a friend?
2592960	2596600	But it's even more than that is that to the degree that it's possible,
2597080	2600640	your actions, even in the presence of your enemy, should be devoted towards
2600640	2602160	the redemption of your enemy.
2603280	2605120	That would be better for you and for them.
2605600	2610240	I mean, if you're good and your enemy is not good, you'd be right to oppose
2610240	2614920	them for the sake of the good and those who represent it.
2615520	2619080	But while you redeem what you can redeem and you reject the rest, right?
2619080	2621360	And that's the separation of the wheat from the chaff.
2621360	2621800	That's it.
2621800	2626200	Well, I learned something a while back about there's this idea at the end
2626200	2631160	of Genesis, when God throws Adam and Eve out of paradise, he sets these
2631160	2635600	cherubs up to guard the gates of paradise and their monstrous forms, these
2635600	2639680	cherubs, and they hold swords that are on fire that turn every which way.
2639920	2641240	It's a very horrifying image.
2641240	2642760	And what does it mean?
2643040	2648080	It means that well, a sword cuts and cleaves and butchers and kills, but a
2648080	2651200	sword can be used to carve, so you can think about a sword as an
2651200	2654840	implement that separates the wheat from the chaff and a burning sword.
2655040	2656280	Well, that's even worse, right?
2656280	2658200	Because it burns the dead wood away.
2658400	2663520	And so a burning, a flaming sword is a sword that cuts all that isn't
2663520	2666400	necessary away and burns all the dead wood off.
2666400	2671800	And of course, that's the case because everything unworthy has to be cut away
2672160	2675160	in order for it to enter paradise by definition.
2675360	2680640	And all dead wood has to be burned away before the living essence can enter
2680640	2681200	paradise.
2681200	2682640	That's another way of thinking about it.
2683000	2688760	And if you're 99% dead wood and pathology, it isn't obvious that the
2688760	2692280	encounter with the flaming sword that turns every which way won't just do you
2692280	2692600	in.
2693360	2695720	And that's, that's the issue of evil.
2695760	2701480	In some regard, you want to redeem what can be redeemed, but you need to
2701480	2703200	reject what's truly serpentine.
2703720	2705200	And that's Eve's sin, by the way.
2705760	2706760	She doesn't do that.
2706760	2711360	She hearkens to the serpent itself, and that's a narcissism of compassion.
2711360	2712120	That's her sin.
2712120	2713600	It's a pride of compassion.
2713800	2719040	My womanly embrace is such that all things can be clasped by breast, including
2719040	2720200	the poisonous serpent.
2720280	2724800	It's like, well, yeah, maybe, maybe not including the poisonous serpent.
2725520	2725760	Right.
2725760	2729640	And I see that playing out in the world now because we have this epidemic of
2729640	2734320	narcissistic compassion where everything can be invited to the table.
2734880	2738320	It's like, well, maybe not everything.
2739200	2739600	Right.
2739640	2740080	Right.
2740240	2747760	And maybe there's only a small remnant of what is truly hellish that has to be
2747760	2751040	rejected, that there's no hope of redeeming.
2751240	2754160	I mean, this is an ancient theological issue, right?
2754200	2759040	But this was played out quite recently in the case of Nicola Sturgeon, right?
2759080	2764280	Because Sturgeon in the Scottish prime minister, no, she famously proclaimed
2764280	2767640	that, well, any man who says he's a woman is a woman.
2768640	2770040	It's like, I'm so compassionate.
2770040	2771840	It's like, people can do whatever they want.
2772120	2773960	It's like, any man, eh?
2775160	2781400	How about psychopathic, serialist, serial killing, sadistic rapists?
2781800	2782720	How about them?
2783960	2788120	Well, when she was asked that question, which she was, she had to hand wave
2788360	2793000	partly because for someone like her, no one like that exists, not really.
2793840	2798160	But the problem is, is that people like that do exist or spirits like that exist.
2798200	2802480	So there's an immediate thing we see here coming from artificial intelligence.
2802920	2807080	And it's, it can do a passable job writing a term paper.
2807760	2808720	We can stop that here.
2808720	2812120	We have an honor code and most, most kids won't do it, almost all.
2812640	2816240	And if they do, it's not too, you know, eventually it'll be indistinguishable.
2816280	2816920	I'm told.
2817120	2818720	Oh, yes, but they're already.
2819120	2822480	But, you know, oral exams, but here's what I'm worried about.
2823720	2827320	This is the chairman of Microsoft, who I used to think was a pretty good guy.
2827760	2829800	He proclaims, well, it's not going to write your final.
2829800	2831120	It's going to write your draft.
2832000	2834840	But writing your draft, that's where you do most of the learning.
2835640	2839560	That's where you read all the stuff that surrounds your subject and decide what's
2839560	2844040	relevant. And that means that, and it goes back to something you've taught me.
2844040	2849560	And that is, if you can't write a draft of a paper or write your own paper,
2850240	2851400	you become a cripple.
2851600	2854440	Well, that's, see, that's the fundamental issue in the argument.
2854440	2859320	It's, it's, because you could say, well, why not just let, if your point is the
2859320	2863520	degree, why not just let AI write your paper and, and handed in and get your A.
2863920	2864760	And it's simple.
2864760	2865800	It's really quite simple.
2868200	2871800	I think it was Alfred North Whitehead who said this is very, very wise thing.
2873560	2878760	You think so that your thoughts can die instead of you.
2879560	2879840	Okay.
2879840	2881560	Now this is biologically true.
2881560	2885240	This is what makes human beings different from all other creatures, right?
2885240	2890160	Maybe this is the spark of God in some sense tied to the biology.
2890760	2894000	So the prefrontal cortex, which is the part of the brain that generates
2894000	2898240	abstractions grew out of the motor cortex, which is the part of the brain that
2898240	2900600	enables you to voluntarily sequence your actions.
2901160	2906080	So what thought is thought is the space in which you create avatars of action.
2906880	2907120	Right.
2907120	2911200	So what a thought we think, because we're materialist atheists and we think
2911200	2914720	we're scientists, we think that a thought is a description of the objective
2914720	2915600	nature of the world.
2915960	2917720	And that was, isn't what a thought is.
2918160	2923360	A thought is a micro, it's a microcosmic avatar of you.
2924280	2925280	That's what a thought is.
2925640	2930920	And if it's a stupid thought, if then you could act it out, you could embody
2930920	2932680	that avatar and then it would become you.
2933320	2938760	But if it's, if it's a faulty avatar and you act it out, then you'll die.
2939440	2941720	Or worse, because there are worse things than dying.
2941960	2943680	You'll end up in something like hell.
2944880	2951680	And so why think so that you can generate virtual selves?
2953320	2957760	Then why think critically so you can kill off the idiot virtual selves
2957760	2959000	before you enact them?
2959560	2963720	Why do that so you don't die or end up in hell?
2963880	2964640	That's why.
2964960	2969560	So why should you think so you don't die and end up or end up in hell?
2969840	2971000	How do you learn to think?
2971200	2974240	Well, not by having AI write your damn papers.
2974480	2976920	The reason you're learning to write is because there's no difference
2976920	2978160	between writing and thinking.
2978600	2982040	And the reason you're learning to think is so that you don't, not only so
2982040	2986640	that you don't fall into a pit, but so that you don't pull everyone you
2986680	2989440	love kicking and screaming into the pit with you.
2989880	2995440	And so you have cheat, cheat, go ahead, see what happens.
2996160	3000240	So, so what you do with a liberal arts education, which you do very well here
3000240	3005360	is you say, don't cheat because you'll put your immortal soul in danger.
3005760	3007320	And people say, well, I don't believe in that.
3007320	3011800	So that's like, go right ahead, take your chances.
3012040	3016720	You know, you make the presumption that you can manipulate the world
3016720	3021520	by lying and cheating, go out there and enact that and watch what happens.
3022120	3025440	You know, we're having an argument about your culture in our culture,
3025440	3026320	but what's true?
3026680	3027880	It's a deep argument.
3028720	3032960	The scientists say, well, objective truth is true, but that's problematic
3032960	3035080	because objective truth gives us no direction.
3035680	3039120	And the postmodernists say, well, there's no overarching metanarrative
3039160	3043280	and everything is relative and they do that to justify their hedonism.
3043640	3048600	And the truth of the matter is we don't know how to define what's real.
3049080	3050760	And most of us are materialists.
3051320	3052840	The material world is what's real.
3053880	3056040	Here's a different proposition.
3057320	3059320	What's real leads you away from hell.
3060200	3061960	Now, that's actually a definition, right?
3061960	3068680	It's a, it's a proposition that your life will be conducted most fully.
3070120	3073880	If you abide by the dictum that what's real is what leads you away from hell.
3074640	3078240	And you might say, well, why would you assume that hell is real?
3078520	3082040	And I would say, if you were there, you'd think it was real.
3083440	3083880	Right.
3084040	3087200	So, and I don't really know what to make of that metaphysically.
3087200	3090000	I mean, I believe it's true and I've believed it for a very long time
3090000	3095040	because I read a lot of literature about hell and you think, well, hell isn't real.
3095040	3098120	It's like, read about unit 731.
3099560	3102600	That was a, that was a Japanese medical unit in China.
3102960	3104840	You read about unit 731.
3104840	3107880	And I would recommend, by the way, for those of you who are watching or listening,
3108040	3111480	that you don't do this because you'll regret it if you do.
3111880	3116520	You read about unit 731 and then come and tell me you don't believe hell is real.
3117200	3122400	If you read enough about atrocity and totalitarian catastrophe,
3122880	3126360	you will absolutely walk away from that thinking that hell is real.
3126520	3130560	And then if you have any sense, you'll think, well, whatever I'm going to do in my life,
3130560	3134560	I'm going to do whatever takes me as far away as from that as I can possibly get.
3135200	3139040	You know, when, when this political scandal blew up around me in Canada,
3139040	3141800	people come up to me and they say this, they say, you're so brave.
3141800	3145520	And I think you don't understand the difference between you and me
3145520	3148720	is I know what to be properly afraid of, right?
3148720	3154560	And I know that when the cat gets your tongue, you will end up in hell.
3154760	3156960	You lose control of that logos, right?
3156960	3160880	Because that's your capacity for voluntary speech, voluntary thought.
3161240	3163080	You lose that link with the logos.
3164000	3165440	You are headed for hell.
3165800	3167920	And that is definitely worse than death.
3168400	3169960	How many could you estimate?
3169960	3173800	How many hours have you spent in private therapeutic counseling?
3174320	3176040	I mean, doing counseling with people.
3179240	3181480	Fifteen thousand hours, I see.
3181480	3187440	That's seven might be more than that seven full working years and eight.
3188000	3191360	But here's why that's a that's a conservative estimate.
3191640	3195520	That's why I asked the question was when you talk like
3197040	3201600	academics have a good education, which I fancy I do are pretty good at understanding
3201600	3205120	the implications of propositions, you know, like
3205880	3210920	if if you said that we're material beings, if we were purely material beings,
3210920	3212520	of course, we couldn't know it.
3212520	3214120	Dogs don't know that they're dogs.
3215160	3217560	But so we were good at things like that, right?
3218600	3224360	You're good at describing the consequences as they appear in individuals.
3224520	3226320	And it's very dramatic.
3226320	3230480	And what is this is one thing, you know, it's in many ways,
3230480	3232240	it's terrifying to be a therapist.
3232240	3234200	And there's a variety of reasons for that.
3234280	3236880	I mean, one of the things you learn if you're
3238040	3242320	if you're a therapist is that you really learn something about the intrinsic
3242320	3246680	worth of people like some of the best people I met in my therapeutic practice,
3246680	3250960	the best people morally were people who were the most who were on the surface.
3253280	3255400	They had nothing going for them.
3255400	3257480	No, nothing worldly going for them.
3257480	3258360	They weren't attractive.
3258360	3259320	They weren't intelligent.
3259320	3260960	They weren't accomplished.
3260960	3262000	They weren't popular.
3262000	3263920	In fact, they were often friendless.
3263920	3265760	They often had devastated families.
3265760	3268520	They had terrible developmental histories.
3269160	3270720	They just had devastated lives.
3270720	3273920	And yet there was still a core of ethical goodness to them
3273920	3277720	that was stunning under the circumstances, miraculous.
3277720	3283720	And so you really that really takes you back to see that that can happen, right?
3283720	3287040	To see that sent that essential nobility of the human spirit.
3288680	3291120	And so so that's a terrifying thing to see.
3291720	3297520	And then and that that goodness can shine through in places that just look dark
3297520	3299640	and and that no one is attending to.
3299640	3303040	And the next thing you learn is don't.
3304480	3309760	Impose your notions of someone's destiny on them.
3310120	3314120	You do not know how that person's life should unfold.
3314360	3317600	You're there to help them think that through.
3317880	3319920	You are not there to give them advice.
3320800	3324480	That's it's a theft, giving someone advice, especially if you're a therapist,
3324480	3330040	is theft because it's theft because if they succeed, well, then it's your success.
3330560	3336040	And it's corrupt theft because if they fail, they bear the consequences and you don't.
3336560	3339680	So so that's terrifying.
3339680	3345040	And then the other thing I learned that was terrifying was I never saw anyone
3345040	3348040	in my therapeutic practice ever get away with anything even once.
3349040	3351960	Like that, you know, there's that old idea that God has a book
3351960	3353880	and and everything you do is written down.
3353880	3356000	It's like, that's not just an idea.
3356640	3358040	You get away with nothing.
3358040	3359720	And of course, it makes sense.
3359720	3365880	It's like reality is real and you distort and bend it at your peril.
3365880	3373000	And you may produce a riff temporarily, but that will snap closed on you.
3373520	3378680	And you may not even notice the connection between your initial sin, failure
3378680	3383040	to meet the target, to hit the target and the consequences of that.
3383360	3386920	But the consequences are inevitable and it's even worse than that
3386920	3389640	because not only are they inevitable, they tend to multiply.
3390240	3395440	And so all of that to to the degree that I've been capable has scared me straight.
3395440	3398160	Let's say it's like, no, I'm not going down that path.
3399120	3404200	And so and you learn to as a therapist, you learn the ancient truth
3404200	3407080	that the truth is redemptive, right?
3407080	3410280	And this is this is another of the great accomplishments of Freud
3410280	3414200	because Freud shed new light on the logos in some ways, right?
3414200	3418920	Because Freud understood that true speech heals.
3420000	3424920	Right. I mean, that's his entire therapeutic approach is bring people in
3425480	3429720	and don't disturb them when they're trying to tell you something.
3430400	3431720	Let them say anything.
3431720	3433440	Absolutely. And that's what he told his clients, too.
3433440	3437240	It's like, say whatever comes to your mind, right?
3437240	3442240	Let no matter how off color, off putting, embarrassing, shameful,
3442560	3447400	aggressive, sexual, find out who you are.
3447400	3448600	That's the first draft.
3448600	3451040	Lay yourself out on the table.
3451040	3453800	And while he had them laid themselves out on the couch, he hid from his client
3453800	3456520	so they couldn't he was afraid that if they saw his face,
3456520	3460400	they would censor themselves by watching his emotional reactions.
3460640	3465080	So he sat off to the side of his clients so they could just
3465640	3468920	say what they had to say with no interference.
3468920	3473520	And you know this because you're an educator, but
3475440	3480880	people cannot organize themselves and come to who they are
3481320	3484480	without laying themselves out and they can't lay themselves out
3484480	3486560	without thinking or talking.
3486560	3488800	Most people think by talking.
3488800	3491280	In fact, you learn to think by talking.
3491280	3493600	You can't talk if no one listens.
3493600	3496880	Most people, most people have no one to listen to them.
3498000	3503000	Yeah. If so, you know, education is a little bit different than therapy,
3503000	3504600	but sometimes not.
3504600	3507400	And one way it's different is
3507400	3512960	now education is a common project that people share
3513720	3517400	and each has to do his part or he won't get any benefit from it,
3518000	3520120	but better together, as you say.
3520600	3525280	And so around here, there's a we have a lot of psychological
3525280	3528600	counseling here, but also the kids counsel each other.
3529160	3533440	And that's and that's a different thing because they're in the same boat.
3533920	3535920	They're trying to get the same thing done.
3535960	3539720	They want to understand the most important things.
3540400	3542320	And that's a form of therapy, actually.
3542680	3546240	Think about it, because well, actually, therapy is a form of that.
3546320	3547560	Yeah. Right. Right.
3547560	3548680	Because yeah, sure, sure.
3548680	3551720	I mean, the therapeutic endeavor is dialogue.
3552720	3554640	Right. And it's.
3554640	3558600	I guess the advantage if you have a good therapist, which is very rare
3558600	3562840	and becoming more and more difficult as it becomes illegal to be a good therapist,
3562840	3565240	which it already is, by the way,
3565240	3567720	because it's now illegal to tell your clients what you think.
3568200	3571360	And so that's the end of that enterprise, because that's all there was to it.
3571360	3575120	So but. Therapy is.
3576800	3580000	It's it's dialogue in search of its dialogue.
3581200	3583080	Look, it's a religious enterprise.
3583280	3585800	It's motivated by love.
3585800	3586960	What's our aim here?
3586960	3589320	Therapeutic aid to make things better.
3589600	3592320	Why? Because we think it's worthy.
3592640	3595360	It's a worthy enterprise to make things better.
3595360	3597360	That's the proclamation of love, right?
3597360	3599560	Love aims at making things better.
3599560	3602680	Love aims at making the world more abundant.
3602680	3605800	It aims at reducing unnecessary suffering, right?
3605800	3607640	It's an ennobling enterprise love.
3607640	3611840	And so the therapeutic process aims at love and uses truth.
3612200	3614000	And that's a religious enterprise.
3614000	3615600	It's a logos enterprise.
3615600	3617600	It's a dialogical enterprise.
3617600	3621040	And it's a form of secularized religious practice.
3621360	3623840	So one last question.
3623840	3624840	I know you're doing things.
3624840	3626600	You're you go all over the world.
3626600	3629400	You got friends and fans everywhere.
3629760	3632080	You started in some kind of organization.
3634960	3636800	My last question is, how are you going to save the world?
3637760	3640440	One person at a time.
3640440	3642000	Right, that's always how it's happened.
3642000	3643920	You know, what's the leftist mantra?
3643920	3645960	The long march through the institutions.
3646400	3649280	Well, how do you combat that with the longer
3649280	3652280	march through the individuals, right?
3652280	3655760	There's the rest of it's an illusion in a way.
3656640	3659680	There are individuals, right?
3659680	3661800	That's where the rubber hits the road.
3662480	3664480	Individuals suffer.
3664480	3667280	Individuals bear responsibility, right?
3667280	3672120	One of the one of the gifts, I suppose, that
3673080	3676160	the biblical corpus gave to the UK,
3676720	3680480	the UK transformed into political wisdom and transmitted to the US
3680480	3683920	was the proposition that the individual was the proper
3684440	3687400	unit of analysis, the fundamental unit of analysis.
3687400	3690000	And I believe that that's the case, which is why I'm a psychologist,
3690000	3694600	as I said, and not a sociologist or a political operative.
3695320	3697760	It's it's the the road.
3698080	3702720	It's it's always been the case that the route to heaven and away from hell
3703360	3705240	is the root of the individual soul.
3706520	3710040	And I believe that that's it's theologically true.
3710040	3711200	It's metaphysically true.
3711200	3713320	It's philosophically true.
3713320	3717280	I also believe that it's materially true, right?
3717320	3721440	Insofar as that sort of truth can be instantiated materially.
3721440	3723240	It's true at every level, simultaneous.
3724080	3726000	In agreeing with that, I will say
3727040	3729960	all of the greatest philosopher, political philosophers
3729960	3733520	and all of the greatest greatest statesmen thought precisely that
3734160	3739280	the purpose of the nation or the regime is the happiness of its people.
3740120	3743800	And they come together to help make it, but each has to make his own.
3744400	3747560	And that I think that's a very beautiful way.
3747560	3749960	That's how the founders of America organized the country.
3750040	3753160	And my own view is.
3754640	3758440	Beautiful things cannot abidingly lose their luster.
3758960	3762040	And I will say that in our time, which is a desperate time,
3762840	3767240	your success and influence is one of the key signs that I'm right about that.
3768040	3769560	Thank you for being with me.
3769560	3772840	Thank you, sir. It's always a pleasure to be at Hillsdale and to see you.
