00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,280
Welcome to the Larry Arn Show on the Hillsdale College podcast network.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:09,360
I would be Larry Arn, President of Hillsdale College, and I have a great and mighty guest

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,360
today.

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,760
His name is Jordan Peterson.

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:19,400
Jordan Peterson is a psychologist and an academic, and he's had two careers, I think

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,120
it's fair to say.

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:27,160
In one, he taught some at Harvard and whatever he taught later for a long time at University

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,600
of Toronto.

9
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,440
And wherever he taught, he leaves a trail behind him of students who love him.

10
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,240
And they testified what it is about him that they love, and you're going to see it for

11
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,160
yourself in a few minutes.

12
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:43,200
In his second career, it starts when a few years ago, he took stand about something,

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:52,320
which was a law in Canada that would require people change all kinds of things that defy

14
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,240
everything ordinary, gender stuff, mostly.

15
00:00:55,240 --> 00:01:01,160
And he stood up against that, and of course, a firestorm came, and he didn't retreat

16
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,160
into any hole.

17
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,820
He'd never been any good at being in a hole.

18
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,920
He decided to go public.

19
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:12,520
And what I like about, I admire him very much and know him well, I'm privileged that way,

20
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:17,880
is that his public career follows the same pattern as his academic career.

21
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:24,360
He's a teacher, and he's relentless, and he's curious, and he knows a lot of stuff.

22
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,720
And he teaches people, and they are grateful, except for the ones who don't want teaching

23
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,360
to happen, and they are enraged, and he's courageous in the face of that.

24
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,480
Welcome, Jordan Peterson.

25
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,560
Thank you, sir.

26
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,120
Because you're a teacher, and because I'm curious about it, I want to talk about psychology,

27
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,240
about what it is.

28
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:48,600
And I know that you like Carl Jung, and because of that, I never did without knowing much

29
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,600
about him.

30
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,160
I've been reading up on him some, and I want you to explain the general thing.

31
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:59,880
What is the discipline of psychology, and then something about him, if you care to say?

32
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,920
Well, we all exist at multiple levels simultaneously.

33
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:12,360
We exist at subatomic level, and the atomic level, and the molecular level, and the level

34
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:18,960
of organs, and the level of our body, and we have motivational systems, and emotional

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:28,000
systems, and cognitive systems, and perceptual systems, and psychology is the study of the

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,680
integration of all of those subordinate levels into the individual.

37
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,400
So you can study all those levels, right up to the level of the individual, and you're

38
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:44,480
in the domain of psychology, and so I like that integrative function of psychology.

39
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:51,760
And so when I was in graduate school in particular, the PhD work I did was really quite biological.

40
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:57,640
I was looking at the genetic, the psychological manifestations of the genetic predisposition

41
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:04,880
to alcoholism and antisocial behavior, and alcohol is a pharmacological agent, and it

42
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,720
spreads through the brain like water, because it crosses the blood-brain barrier, it's one

43
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,000
of the few chemicals that can do that.

44
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,920
And so to study alcohol's effect on psychology, you have to study alcohol's effect on the

45
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:22,520
brain, but it affects every bit of the brain, and every bit of the brain is quite a lot

46
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,520
to study.

47
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:30,240
And so as I was studying alcoholism and the predisposition to alcoholism, I was simultaneously

48
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:35,360
studying how the brain works to understand how alcohol and other drugs changed its function.

49
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,840
And that got me deep into the study of neuroscience, and affect of neuroscience in particular

50
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,680
that's the neuroscience of emotion and motivation.

51
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,560
And that was a burgeoning field at the time, and I read some of the great early classic

52
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,600
works in that field, and at the same time I was reading a lot of work on the clinical

53
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:59,360
front, great clinicians, including the people you mentioned, Freud and Jung, and I was integrating

54
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,480
across those, which was something that hadn't been done.

55
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:09,160
And my first book, Maps of Meaning, was an attempt to integrate across all those levels

56
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:14,320
from the biological to the narrative, that's a good way of thinking about it.

57
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:18,480
Jung, do you call yourself a Jungian?

58
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,200
To some degree, yes.

59
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,520
I don't describe myself that way, but it's definitely the case.

60
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:32,400
I mean, I started reading Freud before I read Jung, and I liked Freud a lot for a variety

61
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,000
of reasons.

62
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,320
So we could go back to Nietzsche to explain this more properly.

63
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,000
So Nietzsche, back in the late 1800s, announced that God was dead.

64
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,320
And what he meant by that, essentially, was that the unity of conception that had brought

65
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,160
us together psychologically and socially was disintegrating.

66
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,200
And Nietzsche knew what the consequence of that would be.

67
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:05,360
He knew that the consequence of that would be nihilism and hopelessness on the one hand

68
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,200
and a turn towards totalitarian certainties on the other.

69
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,200
He nailed that.

70
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,400
Dostoevsky knew the same thing.

71
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,800
And Nietzsche saw a way out, he thought, and his way out was that human beings would have

72
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,520
to become, they would have to adopt the mien of what they had deposed.

73
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:27,800
And so he thought that people would have to become gods in some way, and that we could

74
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,440
do that by creating our own values, that we would have to take it upon ourselves to

75
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:36,320
create our own values, since they were no longer handed down on high from some transcendent

76
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,480
source.

77
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:43,240
And all of the arguments that Nietzsche laid out were very powerful, including that one.

78
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:50,440
But reading Freud helped me understand why Nietzsche was wrong, because Freud noted more

79
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:55,240
clearly than anyone else, at least at that time, that we were not the masters in our

80
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:02,880
own houses, and that the notion that we could produce our own values was predicated on an

81
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:09,520
assumption that in some manner we were intrinsically unitary masters of our own destiny, our own

82
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,440
cognition, our own perceptions, our own emotional states.

83
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,400
And Freud really flipped that on its head.

84
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,600
He said, no, we're more like a haunted house full of autonomous spirits.

85
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:25,000
And those spirits have, those would be complexes in the psychoanalytic term, and those complexes,

86
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,520
those autonomous spirits, some of which are motivational forces, let's say, or emotional

87
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,760
systems.

88
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:37,440
They have an autonomy and a will that can easily supersede our own.

89
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,560
And so it isn't obvious at all that because we're masters of, not masters in our own

90
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,360
house, that we can in any way create our own values.

91
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:56,320
And Freud, I think the weakness of Freud, was that he pronounced one motivational system

92
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,440
superordinate sex.

93
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:06,760
And you could say with some real truth that Freud replaced the god of his ancestors, Yahweh.

94
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,760
Freud was Jewish.

95
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:14,840
He replaced the god of his ancestors with sexuality and put that at the pinnacle of

96
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,600
the human psychological hierarchy.

97
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:23,760
And Jung, who was a student of Freud's, although also a student of Nietzsche's, and perhaps

98
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,520
more deeply a student of Nietzsche's, objected to that.

99
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:35,280
He did not believe that it was appropriate to make the presumption that sex ruled overall.

100
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,640
And I read a lot of Jung, especially when I was in graduate school, I think he had,

101
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,200
I think there's 20 volumes in his collected work, something like that.

102
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,840
I read every single one of them.

103
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,720
And I didn't just read them.

104
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,160
I actually understood them, and that took a lot of work.

105
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:53,040
I read Archetypes of the Collective Unconscious, it was the first book by Jung I wrote.

106
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:58,160
I read, little Freudian slip there.

107
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,840
I read it three times before I knew what the hell he was talking about.

108
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,760
Because what Jung is talking about is so strange that it's almost impenetrable.

109
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,360
And then when you do penetrate it, it's terrifying.

110
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,280
That's why psychologists don't like Jung.

111
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,000
That's why people in general don't.

112
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,720
It's like, he's very hard to understand.

113
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,760
Then when you do understand him, he's very, very terrifying.

114
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:23,120
Because Freud made the case that we were haunted by ghosts, and Jung made the case that we

115
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,120
were haunted by demons and gods, and that's much more accurate.

116
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,120
And when you start to understand that, man, the world is not the same.

117
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,600
It is seriously not the same.

118
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:38,400
So we're going to talk about sex today, because that's all over the place.

119
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:46,000
What are estrangement from and fascination with sex today have to do with Freud?

120
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:53,360
It has to do with what Freud observed, and Freud was correct in that sex is a dominating

121
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,360
force.

122
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:59,960
Nietzsche said, every drive attempts to philosophize in its spirit, brilliant, brilliant aphorism.

123
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,160
He was really something.

124
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:09,080
When the world collapses into materialist atheism, let's say, it's highly likely that

125
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:14,520
sex will arise as the dominant goddess, likely goddess.

126
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:19,440
It's likely on the feminine side more accurately, if you think about it historically.

127
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,840
Now did Freud bring that about?

128
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:30,320
Partly because Freud made the case that there was no metaphysical reality, let's say.

129
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,040
There were biological realities, and that the prime biological reality was that of sex.

130
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,720
And so he laid some of the groundwork for those metaphysical claims.

131
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:49,840
But Freud, to speak in Freud's defense, even though he believed that sex was a dominating

132
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:54,480
force, it isn't clear at all that he believed that it should be.

133
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,640
Now if you pushed Freud, and what he thought should be at the pinnacle of the moral hierarchy,

134
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:04,600
he would say something like, the ability to work and play.

135
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,680
And that's not bad.

136
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,080
That's not too bad.

137
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:12,160
And he had a wisdom, and Freud was also a very practical clinician.

138
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:19,760
But he also viewed, see, Freud was deeply anti-religious in the Enlightenment tradition.

139
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:26,960
And he told Jung at one point that it was necessary to make of the doctrine of sexual

140
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:32,440
motivation an unshakable bulwark against a black tide of occultism.

141
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:37,840
And it's an interesting phrase because there was a black tide of occultism coming, and

142
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,280
we've certainly seen that unfold over the course of the 20th century.

143
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:50,720
But it also highlights one of Freud's metaphysical weaknesses, and it was the weakness that separated

144
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,760
Jung from Freud.

145
00:10:52,760 --> 00:11:01,640
And that was that Freud's materialist, deterministic atheism made him incapable of contending with

146
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:09,200
the realities of the religious world properly, and that undermined his, what would you say,

147
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,840
his ability to sit at the proper pinnacle of the psychoanalytic hierarchy.

148
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:20,120
So Jung believed, like Jung believed that he had a conception that he put forward as

149
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:27,760
the self, and the self is you, is the four dimensional you.

150
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,280
And so why four dimensions?

151
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:37,040
Well, because here you are now in this room at this time, but you are something that extends

152
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:45,240
across time from birth till death, and the totality of you is that entire being is stretched

153
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,920
across time.

154
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:51,160
And Jung's self is the four dimensional totality of the person.

155
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:56,200
Jung was a very sophisticated thinker, and he believed that Christ was a symbol of the

156
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,200
self.

157
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:03,320
Now, what Jung believed religiously, that's a very difficult thing to put your finger

158
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:07,360
on because he was a very sophisticated thinker.

159
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:14,160
I would put him firmly in the Christian camp, but he's not a normal Christian by any stretch

160
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,640
of the imagination.

161
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:21,760
When he says something like Christ is a symbol of the self, he meant something very deep.

162
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:30,120
He meant that, well, he meant, for example, that at the highest level of conceptualization,

163
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:37,080
the human being is something doomed to suffer through death and hell and to emerge reborn.

164
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:42,080
And he really believed that, and not in the way that you believe something preposterous

165
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:47,800
because it's an element of faith, but because he saw that as the deepest form of wisdom,

166
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,200
and he also saw it as something that was inevitably true.

167
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,000
The soul is by nature Christian.

168
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,600
That was certainly something Jung believed.

169
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:01,720
Now let's try to relate that, because something amazing is going on in the world.

170
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:07,120
We are trying to transform ourselves into whatever we want to be, sexual and everything

171
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,120
else.

172
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,920
And you've taken a stand against that.

173
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:17,040
I'd like you to apply, and also, what in psychology has led you to do that?

174
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:24,160
When you say, so, there's a battle right now going on in our culture about self-definition.

175
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:29,320
I am whatever I say I am, which is, by the way, what God said to Moses when he proclaimed

176
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:35,440
his identity, and that's not a trivial comment on what's happening now.

177
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,280
Jung believed that the logical conclusion of Protestantism was that everyone would become

178
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,320
their own church.

179
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,640
When Jung said something, he meant it, like all the way down, and so the logical conclusion

180
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:52,280
of you being your own church is that you're your own God, and that you get to define yourself.

181
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:57,520
And you might say, well, why can't I define myself, and the right answer is, what the

182
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,280
hell do you know about who you are?

183
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:04,600
And you think that there's something in you that's yourself that's defining you, but

184
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,520
how do you know you're not just a pawn of that thing you think is yourself?

185
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:13,680
And so the fatal weakness on the self-definition front is, oh, I see, you're gripped so firmly

186
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:19,760
by your sexuality that your sexuality now proclaims that it's you, and you believe that.

187
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,960
And you think that's you.

188
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:27,400
You don't think that you're worshiping a polytheistic pagan goddess, or that she's got you in her

189
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,400
grip.

190
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:34,080
You think that's you because you have an intrinsic theory of yourself, and your theory of yourself

191
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:38,760
is whatever you want hedonistically in this moment rules, everyone, including you, and

192
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,880
that's right.

193
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:43,600
And that everyone who opposes that is nothing but a demon, essentially.

194
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,960
And that means everybody who opposes that doesn't get the same favor.

195
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,440
They can't define themselves the way they want.

196
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,240
Well, that's the incoherence problem, but the radical types, the narcissistic radical

197
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,480
types, they don't give a damn about incoherence because what they give a damn about is that

198
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,880
they get to do exactly what the hell they want.

199
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,880
With whoever they want this moment.

200
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,880
And if that's...

201
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:11,040
Now, this is where the rubber meets the road, you might say, well, what's the problem with

202
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,040
that?

203
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,840
It's like, why can't I just do whatever the hell I want whenever the hell I want to do

204
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,920
it with whoever I want to do it with?

205
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:23,080
And the answer is, because everything goes to hell if you do that, including you.

206
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,520
And you say, well, I don't believe in hell.

207
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:30,000
And I say, well, keep acting the way you are, and you will, right?

208
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
For sure.

209
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,720
One with an ounce of sense, an iota of sense, and this is actually what defines sense knows

210
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,240
perfectly well.

211
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:42,240
If they only do exactly what they want to do in accordance with the whim of the moment,

212
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,080
which then becomes their God, right?

213
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:48,500
Because if you're motivated by the whim of the moment and you place that above all else,

214
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,760
that is now your God.

215
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,960
Well, what's the God?

216
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,280
Well, in this case, let's say it's sexual motivation.

217
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:58,180
Well, if sexual motivation is your God, you will end up in something indistinguishable

218
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:03,540
from hell because you will, you will misuse other people, you will make them objects of

219
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:09,540
your own narrow and immediate desire, and you'll have no relationships.

220
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,420
You'll exploit everyone, including yourself.

221
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,460
And there's that's no way to live.

222
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,900
Well, why is that no way to live?

223
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,900
You're just moralizing.

224
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:20,860
It's like, no, live like that for two years and find out what happens.

225
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:25,460
No one with any sense will want to be within 20 feet of you.

226
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:29,940
And that's because you'll do nothing but exploit, including, and the thing you'll exploit will

227
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:36,260
include that higher self whose existence you don't, you don't even imagine, right?

228
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:41,100
Because you've already subjugated yourself to the immediacy of your idiot whim.

229
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:45,140
And the people who identify themselves on sexual grounds do that all the time.

230
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:48,580
My paramount feature is who I'm sexually attracted to.

231
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,340
It's really, that's your paramount feature.

232
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,340
Is it?

233
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,060
That's your definition of your intrinsic self.

234
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:58,340
To call you primitive is an insult to primitive people.

235
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:05,500
If so, I want to suggest what's been swept away by all this.

236
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:11,100
In the classic philosophy, in most philosophies since then, the idea was we have a nature.

237
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,700
Everything has a nature.

238
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:17,820
And the nature and our happiness and well-being depends upon fulfilling our nature.

239
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:21,700
My little bit of reading of Young suggested he thought roughly like that.

240
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:25,940
In other words, if he was going to give somebody therapy, he tried to help him become a better

241
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:28,300
person like a person would be.

242
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:33,220
Well, that word nature is interesting because it comes from a Latin word that means birth.

243
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:37,140
It means the process of beginning and growth by which we come to be.

244
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:44,380
Well, if you lose your nature, then you have no purpose outside your own will.

245
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:51,260
And now my question, you've been particularly helpful and popular with men, young men especially.

246
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,820
Why is that, do you think?

247
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:58,740
Well, you can't lose your nature exactly.

248
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:03,460
You can lose your higher order, integrated, purpose-driven nature.

249
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:09,700
Here's some natures you won't lose, pain, anxiety.

250
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:16,500
You can lose your higher nature all you want and all of the negative elements of your nature

251
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,220
will predominate.

252
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:21,900
And you're not going to rationalize yourself out of pain and anxiety.

253
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,580
This is the thing about those who believe life has no meaning.

254
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:31,100
It's like, I see, so you think you can argue yourself out of your pain because pain is

255
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,100
a meaning.

256
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,260
Now, you might say, well, it's not a meaning I want to pursue.

257
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,700
What does that have to do with anything?

258
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,140
Pain is an undeniable reality.

259
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:47,580
Well, if you allow your higher order self to disintegrate, you disintegrate into a landscape

260
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:51,340
characterized by pain, anxiety, and hopelessness.

261
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:54,820
That's the metaphysical desert, by the way.

262
00:18:54,820 --> 00:19:04,380
That's the place you end up devolving into when your tyrannical presuppositions are disintegrate,

263
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:09,340
which is why people cling to their tyrannical presuppositions because there's a mystery.

264
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:14,300
Well, you don't want to end up in the landscape of pain, anxiety, and hopelessness.

265
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:19,900
And I actually mean that technically because what happens when you lose direction, the

266
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:25,140
biological systems that mediate negative emotion signal loss of direction.

267
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,140
That's what anxiety is.

268
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,940
It's a signal of loss of direction.

269
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:30,900
So if you lose higher order direction, you become anxious.

270
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:35,260
Well, and you can argue with anxiety, all you want with your atheistic nihilism, but

271
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:38,340
it isn't going to go away and neither is your pain.

272
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:43,620
And so one of the things I've told my audiences is, you have to be a fool if you doubt the

273
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:47,860
reality of pain and anxiety, pain and terror, let's say.

274
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:48,860
Are they real?

275
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:52,540
It's like, well, of course, that's an ontological argument.

276
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:55,940
They're real enough so you'll act like they're real if they come knocking.

277
00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:01,820
So maybe we can satisfy ourselves with that proclamation.

278
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:05,740
And you say, well, are they the ultimate reality, pain and suffering?

279
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,240
And that's a good question.

280
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,240
That's a tough question.

281
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:16,040
And I would say, no, the things that transcend pain and suffering are more real than pain

282
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,040
and suffering.

283
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:20,340
Well, what transcends suffering?

284
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:29,200
The eternal verities transcend suffering and the higher order nature of man is the antidote

285
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,200
to catastrophic suffering.

286
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,680
It's the antithesis of hell.

287
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,080
Well, what is that?

288
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,080
Is that real?

289
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:39,720
Well, if pain and suffering are real, and if you can transcend them through allegiance

290
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:44,280
with a higher order self, well, then the higher order self is obviously not only real, but

291
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,280
more real.

292
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,480
Well, what is that?

293
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,280
Well, this is why Jung said Christ was a symbol of the self.

294
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,800
How do you transcend the eternal realm of suffering?

295
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,120
How do you escape from hell?

296
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,020
It's the same question.

297
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:00,800
How about voluntary self-sacrifice?

298
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,800
How about that?

299
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,600
Well, that's absolutely no different than the image of the crucifix.

300
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,160
Those are the same thing.

301
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:13,560
Well, why does the spirit of voluntary self-sacrifice protect you against suffering?

302
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:21,200
Well, I need to sacrifice my idiot whims in the moment to serve that element of me that

303
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,600
is continuous across time.

304
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,440
This is like Kant's categorical imperative in some ways.

305
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:36,320
If I'm wise and mature, then I don't make decisions now that will cost me tomorrow or

306
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,120
next week or next month or next year or five years down the road.

307
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:46,560
I contemplate my extended self, which is like a community across time, and I bind my decisions

308
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:50,920
in the present by my covenant with my future self.

309
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,000
And there's no difference between doing that.

310
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:00,680
That means I sacrifice my the whims of the moment to the optimization of the medium and

311
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,960
long run.

312
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,080
And I do the same thing in relationship to other people.

313
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,080
Those are the same thing.

314
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,440
There is no difference.

315
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,040
This is a gospel equation in some ways.

316
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:12,880
There is no difference between treating you properly and treating myself properly.

317
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,920
And that's because in the final analysis, there's actually no difference between you

318
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,960
and me, not fundamentally.

319
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:26,200
The classic American account for most of our history is that's because we're the same kind

320
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,200
of thing.

321
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,400
We're equal in what way are we equal?

322
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:38,040
We're equal in our natures, and the troubled part comes this way.

323
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:45,400
If our natures include how we come to be, then the differences between the sexes are

324
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:51,760
also part of our rights and also, therefore, our obligations.

325
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,640
And that's what you're telling me this morning about a law that's proceeding in Ireland,

326
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:04,080
and they're going to make it illegal to possess books that claim that sex is an innate feature

327
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,720
or that you don't get to choose your own.

328
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,720
Is that what it is?

329
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,720
That's part of it.

330
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,720
Yeah.

331
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,720
Yeah.

332
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,720
Well, it depends on how they define.

333
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:17,240
But it depends on how they end up defining hate speech, but that's already built into

334
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:23,840
the law, the idea that making a distinction between men and women that's categorical,

335
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,480
that's already part of hate speech.

336
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,480
Yeah.

337
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,480
Yeah.

338
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:32,200
Well, it is in part outsprings.

339
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,040
This is, again, where you see the weakness in Nietzsche's argument.

340
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,560
Well, here's the values we've created.

341
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,440
Well, that's not a very good replacement for God.

342
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:46,480
Our replacement for God is narcissistic radicals get to do whatever the hell they want, whenever

343
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,160
they want, all the time.

344
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,240
And if you oppose it, then it's prison for you.

345
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:56,560
Well, that's not much of a substitute for what we had before.

346
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:04,520
And that was our, I went to the church of the Holy Sepulcher in Rome, and that was the

347
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,560
first established church.

348
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:11,520
And it became the model for European society.

349
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:16,800
So it's so interesting the way these conceptions are laid out, let's say, architecturally rather

350
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,520
than conceptually.

351
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:24,360
So at the very center, you have the crucifix, the cross, and that's what would you say?

352
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:29,440
That's the point where all of reality comes to a point.

353
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,760
And it's the point of maximal suffering, and it's more than that.

354
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,320
It's the point of voluntarily accepted maximal suffering.

355
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:41,600
And the notion is that that's a sacrifice.

356
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,840
Why is it a sacrifice?

357
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:49,760
You have to sacrifice, you have to sacrifice your lower self to your higher self in order

358
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:55,680
for you to proceed in a healthy manner to be resilient, but also for you to participate

359
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:59,040
in the covenant that would make for a united society.

360
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:04,520
There's no difference between that maturation, because a lot of what maturation is, is to

361
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:10,320
give up the attractions of the immediate present in the service of something broader

362
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,320
and higher.

363
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:15,360
And that would be you in the broader sense, and what's in your best interest, but also

364
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,240
the community simultaneously.

365
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,080
Those are the same thing.

366
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:23,360
So at the center of the community, you have the sacrifice, the voluntary sacrifice of

367
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,360
self.

368
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,360
That's the center.

369
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,720
You have the church, you have the altar, then you have the church, then you have the town,

370
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:33,040
and around the town you have the state, and then you have the nation.

371
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:37,920
And that's all resting on this spirit of voluntary self-sacrifice, right?

372
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:41,160
And that's the foundation stone of the community.

373
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:45,120
Jung knew that, Jung knew that, and Freud didn't.

374
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:51,120
And because Freud was, he was a materialistic, deterministic atheist of the 19th century,

375
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,240
and Jung is a 20th century thinker.

376
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,640
Maybe he's a 21st century thinker, even.

377
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,120
That's certainly possible.

378
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:03,480
So Churchill said, he wrote once in a book called My Early Life, you must nail your life

379
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,440
to a cross of thought or action.

380
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:11,880
Now he ended up doing both, but in other case, whichever way you go, and so you could say,

381
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:17,760
in your life, Jordan Peterson, it was more thought in the beginning, and it might be

382
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,960
more action now, but in other case, it's a cross.

383
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,200
How do you think of it?

384
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:29,000
Well, you can either lift up a cross or have one dropped on you, right?

385
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,320
There's no non-cross option in this world.

386
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,720
And that's really worth knowing too, and I tell my audiences that consistently.

387
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:43,280
It's like, you all know perfectly well that your idiot hedonism, your idiot immature hedonism

388
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:46,680
is going to vanish in a puff of smoke at the first sign of trouble.

389
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:50,240
You know that, and you know that it's thin, gruel.

390
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,800
That's why you're hedonistic and hopeless at the same time.

391
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,840
You know that.

392
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,080
You need something beyond that.

393
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,080
Why?

394
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:04,400
Because life in some ways is unbearable, and so you need something worth bearing to make

395
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:09,800
it bearable, and life is very heavy load, and so that means you have to carry something

396
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,560
very heavy to justify it.

397
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:17,160
Now, I see this in the biblical corpus, for example, quite clearly laid out in the story

398
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,080
of Abraham, which is a very interesting story.

399
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:24,920
Of course, Abraham is the founder of nations, and so you might say, well, is that true?

400
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:28,360
It's like, those are such stupid questions.

401
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,360
That's such a stupid question.

402
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,080
It's a definition in this story.

403
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:40,280
So the definition is the spirit of Abraham is the founder of nations, right?

404
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:44,800
That's the declaration of the story, and you're to come to understand that when you read the

405
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,800
story.

406
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,640
Now, you might say, well, what did the people who wrote the story mean by that?

407
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:54,280
And the answer is, well, they didn't know, and that's why they wrote the story.

408
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,120
Like the story is the explanation.

409
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,160
Okay, so what's the story?

410
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:04,720
Well, Abraham is a human being, and that means he's like a natural human being, and that

411
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,000
means he's useless and lazy.

412
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,520
And if he can have it easy, he will.

413
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,320
And so Abraham is like the first case of white privilege.

414
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,560
He's a good joke.

415
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,560
He's rich.

416
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:22,200
His parents are rich, and he can just lay around his tent all day and eat peeled grapes

417
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:27,240
and have like beautiful slave women wave palm fronds over him and do nothing.

418
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,120
And he does that for like 83 years.

419
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,240
And then one day a voice comes to him, right, a spirit.

420
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,440
He's inspired by a spirit.

421
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,400
And what's the nature of the spirit?

422
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:43,240
Well, it's the spirit that calls him to adventure.

423
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:47,280
And it says to him, get your lazy ass the hell out of the tent.

424
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,080
You're made for more than this.

425
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:58,200
And so Abraham, in a great act of faith, abides by the intuition of this spirit, and he leaves

426
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:02,720
his comfortable infancy, right, because he's an infant.

427
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,760
He lives in an infantile utopia.

428
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,640
So, right, well, what do I want?

429
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:11,640
Well, I never want to be hungry, and I never want to be thirsty.

430
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,760
I never want to be deprived.

431
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,560
It's like, well, great, you're an infant sleeping in a crib.

432
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,960
You've got infant paradise.

433
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,520
Is that what you're made for, right?

434
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,560
The mere cessation of your needs.

435
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,360
That's your vision of utopia, is it?

436
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,560
Well, that was Abraham's vision of utopia.

437
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:30,880
And a counter spirit came along and said, get your lazy ass the hell out of your tent

438
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,520
and get out there in the world.

439
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,680
And of course, it's a complete catastrophe, right?

440
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:42,600
Like, he faces tyranny and war and the necessary sacrifice of his son and collusion among the

441
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:48,600
aristocrats to steal his wife, and, like, it's just a disaster in 10 different directions.

442
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,120
But it's an adventure.

443
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,440
It's an adventure, right?

444
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,600
And so what's life?

445
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,280
Is it hedonistic, infantile bliss?

446
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:00,720
This is something Dostoyevsky objected to, or is it a romantic adventure?

447
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,320
Well, what do people go watch when they go see a movie?

448
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,880
They watch a romantic adventure.

449
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,880
Well, why?

450
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,360
Because that's what they want in their life.

451
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:15,120
They don't want peace and tranquility and guaranteed basic income and the pleasures of

452
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,480
infantile, gratified infantile dependence.

453
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,400
They want a bloody adventure.

454
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:24,480
And if they don't get a real adventure, they'll take a false one and wreak havoc.

455
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,360
And we have no shortage of false adventures in our culture.

456
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:33,440
So the woke culture and the transgender movement and all these great things that have come

457
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,960
upon us so hard, are they going to suppress that for people?

458
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,720
You're not going to get to have your adventure.

459
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,720
You're going to have to...

460
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:45,200
Well, they put forward a false adventure, and the false adventure is wave a placard

461
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,680
and save the world.

462
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,680
That's right.

463
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,680
Great.

464
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,680
Isn't that wonderful?

465
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:54,560
All you have to do, you know how I stopped getting protesters to my events at university?

466
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,360
I held them in the morning.

467
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,360
That's great.

468
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,360
No kidding, eh?

469
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,360
I'm the Messiah.

470
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,360
Yeah, really?

471
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,640
Well, as long as you don't want me to get out of bed before noon, yeah.

472
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,360
So that's the false adventure sold to young kids.

473
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:11,320
It's like, well, the planet's going to hell in a handbasket.

474
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,320
That's the claim.

475
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:16,040
It's like, yeah, yeah, the planet's always been going to hell in a handbasket, right?

476
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:21,120
The apocalypse is always nigh, and that's because we die and so does everything else.

477
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:26,880
And so, well, the apocalypse is nigh, and you can save the world by protesting against

478
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,520
those who are at fault.

479
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,920
That's what universities sell young people.

480
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,440
Well, it's an adventure, right?

481
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:37,680
They have a messianic urge at that age, and that really never goes away in people in some

482
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:42,840
fundamental sense, but it's particularly acute when late adolescents are trying to catalyze

483
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:46,600
their identity, and the left offers these false adventures.

484
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:54,440
You print out a sign that says, I oppose poverty as if anyone doesn't, and you wave that around

485
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,040
publicly, which is the same as praying in public, right?

486
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,280
It's a great sin.

487
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:02,640
And you proclaim your moral virtue, and bang, that's your adventure.

488
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:07,920
And it's a cheap pathway to reputational accomplishment.

489
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:12,280
And part of the reason young guys do it, you know perfectly well, is because they're trying

490
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:21,960
to impress young women, and it's kind of, what would you say, there's a surface attraction

491
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:29,240
to being a kind of rebellious quasi-shea guavara type, and to be taking on the evil corporations

492
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:36,480
of the world when you're 18, you know, instead of working at 7-Eleven and handing out sugar

493
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,480
water to kids.

494
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:44,720
Do you think that there's something that young people really need that will ultimately redeem

495
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,360
them from this, enough of them at least, to save the world?

496
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,360
Do you think that...

497
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,360
They need a burden.

498
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,360
They need a burden.

499
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,360
Absolutely.

500
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,360
And they want one, you're saying.

501
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,360
You get, absolutely.

502
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:58,800
Well, and you can explain that to them in some ways the way I just explained it.

503
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:04,160
It's like, look, guys, you're going to suffer, and most of them are already suffering, so

504
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,160
they know that.

505
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:08,960
It's like, and do you want to suffer stupidly too?

506
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,680
Because that's even worse.

507
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:15,920
And then do you want to contemplate for a moment what's going to be your arc when the

508
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,920
storms come?

509
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:20,520
Well, I can tell you what it is, and you already know this because you've consulted your own

510
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,560
conscience.

511
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:24,920
When you're awake at 3 in the morning thinking about what a useless bastard you are, how

512
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:28,960
many sins you have on your conscience, if you're fortunate, there'll be a few of your

513
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:35,000
adventures come to mind where you think, well, you know, I didn't do so bad then.

514
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,800
You know, maybe there's something to me.

515
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:41,620
And so what do people remember when they have those memories?

516
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:45,480
They remember the times when they stepped outside of their narrow cells and took on

517
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:49,080
some bloody responsibility, at least for themselves.

518
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:55,080
And then maybe for someone else too, and then maybe for a lot of other people.

519
00:33:55,080 --> 00:34:01,200
And so if you tell young man, look, you're going to find the meaning in your life by

520
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:07,440
adopting maximal responsibility, right?

521
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,780
That's going to be extremely difficult because you're so bloody useless.

522
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:15,760
You can't even get your own house in order, and you're going to be called upon not only

523
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:20,040
to get your house in order, but to do that well enough so some woman can stand having

524
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:24,240
you around for more than like 15 minutes in the back of a car.

525
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:28,040
And then maybe you're going to have to do it so that you could be a good father to a

526
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,560
family and a pillar of the community.

527
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,360
And that's not just empty words.

528
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:37,600
Like if you do that nobly, there'll be something to you.

529
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:44,240
And then when the storms come, you won't be blown over by the first four foot wave.

530
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:49,880
And young men think, huh, I mean, I could be something that wasn't blown over by the

531
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,720
first four foot wave.

532
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:57,280
They think, oh, well, that's, that's, that's inspiring.

533
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,720
Maybe that's worth doing a little work towards it on the off chance.

534
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,640
It might be true.

535
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,480
And the thing about it is, it is true.

536
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:10,400
So it's not that difficult once you understand it to make a case for it.

537
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,400
It's true.

538
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:17,120
And it is also true that you grow in proportion to the weight you take on voluntarily.

539
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:21,560
And it's also true that we have no idea what the upper limit to that is, right?

540
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:25,800
So, you know, you, you've met remarkable people in your life.

541
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,740
People can do remarkable things.

542
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:32,220
And there are inevitably people who take, who took on remarkable burdens.

543
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:36,720
And because they did that, their development was forced by necessity.

544
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:41,960
They were forced by necessity to grow beyond what they were.

545
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,840
And who knows what the limit to that is.

546
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:49,800
People, so something I see in the college business, our college, Schillstock College,

547
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:53,680
has got about the same number of boys and girls, a few more boys.

548
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:58,920
And they come from a pool of applicants that are equal size and equal qualification.

549
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,840
Almost nobody has that.

550
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:05,840
And the boys do just about as well as the girls, although they do get into contests

551
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,800
doing things like throwing deer urine on each other and stuff, they've done that.

552
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,880
But some of the best boys I've ever met have done that.

553
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,200
As a matter of fact, they're in the Marine Corps now, stupid boys.

554
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:22,320
And they, and, and the thing is, people will say, how are you successful with boys?

555
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,960
And I say, we treat them like boys, you know, they want to be treated like boys.

556
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:33,440
They, and, and girls, women, we've always had boys and girls here, women and men here, right?

557
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,720
And they've always done well.

558
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:39,560
And their intellectual capacities are, you know, they're the same kind of thing.

559
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:44,800
And their physical paths are not the same.

560
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,320
And they can wish them the same if they want to.

561
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,080
But, but they don't.

562
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,480
No, really, they don't.

563
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:59,120
I mean, I, you know what I find is, and, and, you know, I have two daughters.

564
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:06,520
You have one, I think, and she's, your daughter is like my daughter's very tough, very assertive,

565
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,520
very womanly, you see.

566
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:16,560
And so in other words, the classic account is they're good at being what they are.

567
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:21,280
And that's a service, you know, human above all, but also male or female.

568
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,440
And that's a service that burden you're talking about.

569
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:30,720
The first burden everyone carries is, how do you become a good one of these?

570
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:36,000
And by, if by thinking it, that's all.

571
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,520
As you say, that's no burden.

572
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:41,360
So no satisfaction.

573
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,240
How do you think?

574
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,600
Predict the future for me a little bit.

575
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,840
What's, what's going to happen?

576
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,520
Seems to me things are coming to a point.

577
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,160
Do you think so?

578
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:56,480
Yeah, well, I think things have always been coming to a point, but they're coming to a

579
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,800
point way faster.

580
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:03,680
And I mean, that's partly a consequence of the technological revolution.

581
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:08,080
I mean, we know that, well, we have Moore's law, right?

582
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,880
Computing power doubles every 18 months.

583
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,160
It's like, no, no, you don't understand.

584
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:16,720
Computing power doubles every 18 months.

585
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,440
That's not some casual phrase.

586
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:23,040
That's an absolute bloody revolution in every possible direction.

587
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,560
And it's not just computing power.

588
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,560
It's storage power.

589
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:28,160
And there's all sorts of doublings take taking place.

590
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:33,480
And we're now at the point in, in the course of technological pro progress, where those

591
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:37,840
doublings are happening multiple times within the span of a single life.

592
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,000
And so it's pretty obvious.

593
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
And that means the ancient archetypal battles are accelerating.

594
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,560
That's exactly what it means.

595
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,400
The battles between good and evil is accelerating.

596
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,120
And it's always been there.

597
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,920
Is the apocalypse nigh?

598
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:54,680
It's like, well, it's always been nigh, but it might be a little more nigh than it

599
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,160
has been in the past.

600
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,400
You've been talking about artificial intelligence.

601
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,320
And recently I have become more concerned about that.

602
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,120
What are your concerns and what are your hopes for it?

603
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:08,920
Well, I suppose my fundamental concern is that we'll automate a super intelligent

604
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,680
tyranny, right?

605
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,720
And I mean, that's not a concern that's limited to me.

606
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:18,280
That's the, that's the motif of endless numbers of science fiction dystopias.

607
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:23,680
And, you know, science fiction is where you, where engineers dream, right?

608
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:28,320
And sometimes it's where they have their nightmares and engineers are notoriously

609
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,320
atheistic.

610
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:33,240
And so they turn to worship of Star Wars, for example, as an alternative.

611
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:39,600
But their nightmares and dreams are in the popular culture, in popular imagination.

612
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:42,600
And dystopian science fiction is the nightmare of engineers.

613
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:46,920
And the nightmare of tower of babble building engineers is that we'll automate

614
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:50,120
a super intelligent tyranny.

615
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,520
Chinese are hell bent on doing that.

616
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,840
They're doing it at the moment.

617
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,400
Could we do it here?

618
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,320
Absolutely.

619
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,560
Are we?

620
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,680
Yeah.

621
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:02,120
Will it, will, will that dominate?

622
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,760
We'll see.

623
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,840
You know, my sense, and I learned a fair bit of this from Jung, but, you know, what

624
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:14,280
one of the things I learned from Jung was that deeply was that salvation, redemption,

625
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:18,440
was an individual enterprise, which is why I'm a psychologist and not a politician,

626
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,160
because I believe that to be true.

627
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:26,920
I think that hell is, what would you say, kept at bay one person at a time.

628
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:30,760
And I do believe that people have a divine destiny, let's say.

629
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:37,240
And one of the proper elements of our divine destiny is to keep hell at bay.

630
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:43,680
And you do that by, you do that as a consequence of your choices as an individual.

631
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:49,360
I also believe that every single individual is, is in that up to their necks.

632
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:52,480
You know, Dostoevsky said something very strange at one point.

633
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:57,360
He said, every man is responsible not only for everything he does, but for everyone,

634
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,080
everyone else does.

635
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,760
And of course, that's insane, right?

636
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:07,760
In that crazy Dostoevsky way that is more sane, that insanity that's more sane than

637
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,200
sanity, that's Dostoevsky in a nutshell.

638
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:15,160
And I think there's something true about it is that we each have an archetypal destiny

639
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:20,320
and the fate of the world rests on each person's shoulders, like genuinely.

640
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:24,240
And when I'm traveling around the world talking to people, I'm trying to tell them

641
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:28,280
that's like, no, no, you don't understand, this is up to you.

642
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:32,320
Now, I don't understand how it can be up to you because it's also up to me.

643
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:37,240
And I don't exactly see how it can be equally and finally up to both of us.

644
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,640
But that's OK.

645
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,720
There's lots of things about the world I don't understand.

646
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:46,680
And I suppose being, what would you say, touched by a spark of divinity, which is,

647
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:50,800
I suppose, what characterizes us, each of us bears an infinite responsibility.

648
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:55,520
And people need to know that and that it's this is no game.

649
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,320
So you have to carry the burden for more than your own sake.

650
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:04,560
Well, well, it it you're you're in this dish.

651
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:08,360
You're in this, your sake is indistinguishable from the sake of the totality.

652
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,320
See, the Buddha figured this out, right?

653
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,880
Because Buddha.

654
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,520
What would you say?

655
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:18,000
He he he achieved enlightenment under the bowtree.

656
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,200
He was in Nirvana.

657
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,840
He was in paradise and he could stay there.

658
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,480
That was on the table.

659
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:26,600
And that's a hell of an offer to be able to stay in paradise.

660
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,760
And he rejected it.

661
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,400
And the reason he rejected it was because in his estimation, any

662
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:34,400
paradise that it didn't include, everyone wasn't the real paradise.

663
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:39,720
And so he left Nirvana to come back to earth, so to speak, to serve as a teacher,

664
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:42,640
to drag everyone else along on the road to Nirvana.

665
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,040
And that's.

666
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:49,480
Well, that's that's that's correct, is that that that.

667
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,400
It's correct in that they're in the final analysis.

668
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,840
There is no distinction between you and someone else.

669
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,960
It's a terrible thing to contemplate.

670
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,920
They're the same thing.

671
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:05,240
And that's why you're supposed to love your enemy, I suppose.

672
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:07,120
And what does that mean to love your enemy?

673
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:10,440
Well, first of all, it might mean to begin with, to hope that he wouldn't have

674
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:12,760
to be an enemy because why not have a friend?

675
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:16,600
But it's even more than that is that to the degree that it's possible,

676
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:20,640
your actions, even in the presence of your enemy, should be devoted towards

677
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,160
the redemption of your enemy.

678
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,120
That would be better for you and for them.

679
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:30,240
I mean, if you're good and your enemy is not good, you'd be right to oppose

680
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:34,920
them for the sake of the good and those who represent it.

681
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:39,080
But while you redeem what you can redeem and you reject the rest, right?

682
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,360
And that's the separation of the wheat from the chaff.

683
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:41,800
That's it.

684
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:46,200
Well, I learned something a while back about there's this idea at the end

685
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:51,160
of Genesis, when God throws Adam and Eve out of paradise, he sets these

686
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:55,600
cherubs up to guard the gates of paradise and their monstrous forms, these

687
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:59,680
cherubs, and they hold swords that are on fire that turn every which way.

688
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,240
It's a very horrifying image.

689
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,760
And what does it mean?

690
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:08,080
It means that well, a sword cuts and cleaves and butchers and kills, but a

691
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:11,200
sword can be used to carve, so you can think about a sword as an

692
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:14,840
implement that separates the wheat from the chaff and a burning sword.

693
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,280
Well, that's even worse, right?

694
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,200
Because it burns the dead wood away.

695
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:23,520
And so a burning, a flaming sword is a sword that cuts all that isn't

696
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,400
necessary away and burns all the dead wood off.

697
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:31,800
And of course, that's the case because everything unworthy has to be cut away

698
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,160
in order for it to enter paradise by definition.

699
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:40,640
And all dead wood has to be burned away before the living essence can enter

700
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:41,200
paradise.

701
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,640
That's another way of thinking about it.

702
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:48,760
And if you're 99% dead wood and pathology, it isn't obvious that the

703
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:52,280
encounter with the flaming sword that turns every which way won't just do you

704
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:52,600
in.

705
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:55,720
And that's, that's the issue of evil.

706
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:01,480
In some regard, you want to redeem what can be redeemed, but you need to

707
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:03,200
reject what's truly serpentine.

708
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,200
And that's Eve's sin, by the way.

709
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:06,760
She doesn't do that.

710
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:11,360
She hearkens to the serpent itself, and that's a narcissism of compassion.

711
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,120
That's her sin.

712
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,600
It's a pride of compassion.

713
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:19,040
My womanly embrace is such that all things can be clasped by breast, including

714
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,200
the poisonous serpent.

715
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:24,800
It's like, well, yeah, maybe, maybe not including the poisonous serpent.

716
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:25,760
Right.

717
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:29,640
And I see that playing out in the world now because we have this epidemic of

718
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:34,320
narcissistic compassion where everything can be invited to the table.

719
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:38,320
It's like, well, maybe not everything.

720
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:39,600
Right.

721
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:40,080
Right.

722
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:47,760
And maybe there's only a small remnant of what is truly hellish that has to be

723
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,040
rejected, that there's no hope of redeeming.

724
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:54,160
I mean, this is an ancient theological issue, right?

725
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:59,040
But this was played out quite recently in the case of Nicola Sturgeon, right?

726
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:04,280
Because Sturgeon in the Scottish prime minister, no, she famously proclaimed

727
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:07,640
that, well, any man who says he's a woman is a woman.

728
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,040
It's like, I'm so compassionate.

729
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,840
It's like, people can do whatever they want.

730
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:13,960
It's like, any man, eh?

731
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:21,400
How about psychopathic, serialist, serial killing, sadistic rapists?

732
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:22,720
How about them?

733
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:28,120
Well, when she was asked that question, which she was, she had to hand wave

734
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:33,000
partly because for someone like her, no one like that exists, not really.

735
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:38,160
But the problem is, is that people like that do exist or spirits like that exist.

736
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:42,480
So there's an immediate thing we see here coming from artificial intelligence.

737
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:47,080
And it's, it can do a passable job writing a term paper.

738
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:48,720
We can stop that here.

739
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:52,120
We have an honor code and most, most kids won't do it, almost all.

740
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:56,240
And if they do, it's not too, you know, eventually it'll be indistinguishable.

741
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:56,920
I'm told.

742
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:58,720
Oh, yes, but they're already.

743
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:02,480
But, you know, oral exams, but here's what I'm worried about.

744
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:07,320
This is the chairman of Microsoft, who I used to think was a pretty good guy.

745
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,800
He proclaims, well, it's not going to write your final.

746
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,120
It's going to write your draft.

747
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,840
But writing your draft, that's where you do most of the learning.

748
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:19,560
That's where you read all the stuff that surrounds your subject and decide what's

749
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:24,040
relevant. And that means that, and it goes back to something you've taught me.

750
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:29,560
And that is, if you can't write a draft of a paper or write your own paper,

751
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:31,400
you become a cripple.

752
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:34,440
Well, that's, see, that's the fundamental issue in the argument.

753
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:39,320
It's, it's, because you could say, well, why not just let, if your point is the

754
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:43,520
degree, why not just let AI write your paper and, and handed in and get your A.

755
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:44,760
And it's simple.

756
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:45,800
It's really quite simple.

757
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:51,800
I think it was Alfred North Whitehead who said this is very, very wise thing.

758
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:58,760
You think so that your thoughts can die instead of you.

759
00:47:59,560 --> 00:47:59,840
Okay.

760
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,560
Now this is biologically true.

761
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:05,240
This is what makes human beings different from all other creatures, right?

762
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:10,160
Maybe this is the spark of God in some sense tied to the biology.

763
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:14,000
So the prefrontal cortex, which is the part of the brain that generates

764
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,240
abstractions grew out of the motor cortex, which is the part of the brain that

765
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,600
enables you to voluntarily sequence your actions.

766
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:26,080
So what thought is thought is the space in which you create avatars of action.

767
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:27,120
Right.

768
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:31,200
So what a thought we think, because we're materialist atheists and we think

769
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,720
we're scientists, we think that a thought is a description of the objective

770
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:35,600
nature of the world.

771
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:37,720
And that was, isn't what a thought is.

772
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:43,360
A thought is a micro, it's a microcosmic avatar of you.

773
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:45,280
That's what a thought is.

774
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:50,920
And if it's a stupid thought, if then you could act it out, you could embody

775
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:52,680
that avatar and then it would become you.

776
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:58,760
But if it's, if it's a faulty avatar and you act it out, then you'll die.

777
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,720
Or worse, because there are worse things than dying.

778
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:03,680
You'll end up in something like hell.

779
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:11,680
And so why think so that you can generate virtual selves?

780
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:17,760
Then why think critically so you can kill off the idiot virtual selves

781
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,000
before you enact them?

782
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:23,720
Why do that so you don't die or end up in hell?

783
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:24,640
That's why.

784
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:29,560
So why should you think so you don't die and end up or end up in hell?

785
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:31,000
How do you learn to think?

786
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:34,240
Well, not by having AI write your damn papers.

787
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,920
The reason you're learning to write is because there's no difference

788
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:38,160
between writing and thinking.

789
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:42,040
And the reason you're learning to think is so that you don't, not only so

790
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:46,640
that you don't fall into a pit, but so that you don't pull everyone you

791
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:49,440
love kicking and screaming into the pit with you.

792
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:55,440
And so you have cheat, cheat, go ahead, see what happens.

793
00:49:56,160 --> 00:50:00,240
So, so what you do with a liberal arts education, which you do very well here

794
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:05,360
is you say, don't cheat because you'll put your immortal soul in danger.

795
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,320
And people say, well, I don't believe in that.

796
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:11,800
So that's like, go right ahead, take your chances.

797
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:16,720
You know, you make the presumption that you can manipulate the world

798
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:21,520
by lying and cheating, go out there and enact that and watch what happens.

799
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:25,440
You know, we're having an argument about your culture in our culture,

800
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,320
but what's true?

801
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:27,880
It's a deep argument.

802
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:32,960
The scientists say, well, objective truth is true, but that's problematic

803
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:35,080
because objective truth gives us no direction.

804
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:39,120
And the postmodernists say, well, there's no overarching metanarrative

805
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:43,280
and everything is relative and they do that to justify their hedonism.

806
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:48,600
And the truth of the matter is we don't know how to define what's real.

807
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:50,760
And most of us are materialists.

808
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:52,840
The material world is what's real.

809
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:56,040
Here's a different proposition.

810
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,320
What's real leads you away from hell.

811
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,960
Now, that's actually a definition, right?

812
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:08,680
It's a, it's a proposition that your life will be conducted most fully.

813
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:13,880
If you abide by the dictum that what's real is what leads you away from hell.

814
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:18,240
And you might say, well, why would you assume that hell is real?

815
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:22,040
And I would say, if you were there, you'd think it was real.

816
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:23,880
Right.

817
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:27,200
So, and I don't really know what to make of that metaphysically.

818
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,000
I mean, I believe it's true and I've believed it for a very long time

819
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:35,040
because I read a lot of literature about hell and you think, well, hell isn't real.

820
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:38,120
It's like, read about unit 731.

821
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:42,600
That was a, that was a Japanese medical unit in China.

822
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,840
You read about unit 731.

823
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:47,880
And I would recommend, by the way, for those of you who are watching or listening,

824
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:51,480
that you don't do this because you'll regret it if you do.

825
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:56,520
You read about unit 731 and then come and tell me you don't believe hell is real.

826
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:02,400
If you read enough about atrocity and totalitarian catastrophe,

827
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:06,360
you will absolutely walk away from that thinking that hell is real.

828
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:10,560
And then if you have any sense, you'll think, well, whatever I'm going to do in my life,

829
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:14,560
I'm going to do whatever takes me as far away as from that as I can possibly get.

830
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:19,040
You know, when, when this political scandal blew up around me in Canada,

831
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,800
people come up to me and they say this, they say, you're so brave.

832
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:25,520
And I think you don't understand the difference between you and me

833
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:28,720
is I know what to be properly afraid of, right?

834
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:34,560
And I know that when the cat gets your tongue, you will end up in hell.

835
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:36,960
You lose control of that logos, right?

836
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:40,880
Because that's your capacity for voluntary speech, voluntary thought.

837
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:43,080
You lose that link with the logos.

838
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,440
You are headed for hell.

839
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,920
And that is definitely worse than death.

840
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:49,960
How many could you estimate?

841
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:53,800
How many hours have you spent in private therapeutic counseling?

842
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:56,040
I mean, doing counseling with people.

843
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:01,480
Fifteen thousand hours, I see.

844
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:07,440
That's seven might be more than that seven full working years and eight.

845
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,360
But here's why that's a that's a conservative estimate.

846
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:15,520
That's why I asked the question was when you talk like

847
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:21,600
academics have a good education, which I fancy I do are pretty good at understanding

848
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:25,120
the implications of propositions, you know, like

849
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:30,920
if if you said that we're material beings, if we were purely material beings,

850
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:32,520
of course, we couldn't know it.

851
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,120
Dogs don't know that they're dogs.

852
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:37,560
But so we were good at things like that, right?

853
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:44,360
You're good at describing the consequences as they appear in individuals.

854
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:46,320
And it's very dramatic.

855
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:50,480
And what is this is one thing, you know, it's in many ways,

856
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,240
it's terrifying to be a therapist.

857
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:54,200
And there's a variety of reasons for that.

858
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:56,880
I mean, one of the things you learn if you're

859
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:02,320
if you're a therapist is that you really learn something about the intrinsic

860
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:06,680
worth of people like some of the best people I met in my therapeutic practice,

861
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:10,960
the best people morally were people who were the most who were on the surface.

862
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:15,400
They had nothing going for them.

863
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:17,480
No, nothing worldly going for them.

864
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:18,360
They weren't attractive.

865
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:19,320
They weren't intelligent.

866
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:20,960
They weren't accomplished.

867
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,000
They weren't popular.

868
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,920
In fact, they were often friendless.

869
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,760
They often had devastated families.

870
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:28,520
They had terrible developmental histories.

871
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:30,720
They just had devastated lives.

872
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:33,920
And yet there was still a core of ethical goodness to them

873
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:37,720
that was stunning under the circumstances, miraculous.

874
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:43,720
And so you really that really takes you back to see that that can happen, right?

875
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:47,040
To see that sent that essential nobility of the human spirit.

876
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:51,120
And so so that's a terrifying thing to see.

877
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:57,520
And then and that that goodness can shine through in places that just look dark

878
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,640
and and that no one is attending to.

879
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:03,040
And the next thing you learn is don't.

880
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:09,760
Impose your notions of someone's destiny on them.

881
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:14,120
You do not know how that person's life should unfold.

882
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:17,600
You're there to help them think that through.

883
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:19,920
You are not there to give them advice.

884
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:24,480
That's it's a theft, giving someone advice, especially if you're a therapist,

885
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:30,040
is theft because it's theft because if they succeed, well, then it's your success.

886
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:36,040
And it's corrupt theft because if they fail, they bear the consequences and you don't.

887
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:39,680
So so that's terrifying.

888
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:45,040
And then the other thing I learned that was terrifying was I never saw anyone

889
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:48,040
in my therapeutic practice ever get away with anything even once.

890
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:51,960
Like that, you know, there's that old idea that God has a book

891
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:53,880
and and everything you do is written down.

892
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:56,000
It's like, that's not just an idea.

893
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,040
You get away with nothing.

894
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:59,720
And of course, it makes sense.

895
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:05,880
It's like reality is real and you distort and bend it at your peril.

896
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:13,000
And you may produce a riff temporarily, but that will snap closed on you.

897
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:18,680
And you may not even notice the connection between your initial sin, failure

898
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:23,040
to meet the target, to hit the target and the consequences of that.

899
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:26,920
But the consequences are inevitable and it's even worse than that

900
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:29,640
because not only are they inevitable, they tend to multiply.

901
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:35,440
And so all of that to to the degree that I've been capable has scared me straight.

902
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:38,160
Let's say it's like, no, I'm not going down that path.

903
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:44,200
And so and you learn to as a therapist, you learn the ancient truth

904
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:47,080
that the truth is redemptive, right?

905
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:50,280
And this is this is another of the great accomplishments of Freud

906
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:54,200
because Freud shed new light on the logos in some ways, right?

907
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:58,920
Because Freud understood that true speech heals.

908
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,920
Right. I mean, that's his entire therapeutic approach is bring people in

909
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:09,720
and don't disturb them when they're trying to tell you something.

910
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,720
Let them say anything.

911
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:13,440
Absolutely. And that's what he told his clients, too.

912
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:17,240
It's like, say whatever comes to your mind, right?

913
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:22,240
Let no matter how off color, off putting, embarrassing, shameful,

914
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:27,400
aggressive, sexual, find out who you are.

915
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:28,600
That's the first draft.

916
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:31,040
Lay yourself out on the table.

917
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:33,800
And while he had them laid themselves out on the couch, he hid from his client

918
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:36,520
so they couldn't he was afraid that if they saw his face,

919
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:40,400
they would censor themselves by watching his emotional reactions.

920
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:45,080
So he sat off to the side of his clients so they could just

921
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:48,920
say what they had to say with no interference.

922
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:53,520
And you know this because you're an educator, but

923
00:57:55,440 --> 00:58:00,880
people cannot organize themselves and come to who they are

924
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:04,480
without laying themselves out and they can't lay themselves out

925
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,560
without thinking or talking.

926
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,800
Most people think by talking.

927
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:11,280
In fact, you learn to think by talking.

928
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,600
You can't talk if no one listens.

929
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:16,880
Most people, most people have no one to listen to them.

930
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Yeah. If so, you know, education is a little bit different than therapy,

931
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,600
but sometimes not.

932
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:27,400
And one way it's different is

933
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:32,960
now education is a common project that people share

934
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:37,400
and each has to do his part or he won't get any benefit from it,

935
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,120
but better together, as you say.

936
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:45,280
And so around here, there's a we have a lot of psychological

937
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:48,600
counseling here, but also the kids counsel each other.

938
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:53,440
And that's and that's a different thing because they're in the same boat.

939
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,920
They're trying to get the same thing done.

940
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:59,720
They want to understand the most important things.

941
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:02,320
And that's a form of therapy, actually.

942
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:06,240
Think about it, because well, actually, therapy is a form of that.

943
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:07,560
Yeah. Right. Right.

944
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:08,680
Because yeah, sure, sure.

945
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:11,720
I mean, the therapeutic endeavor is dialogue.

946
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:14,640
Right. And it's.

947
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:18,600
I guess the advantage if you have a good therapist, which is very rare

948
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:22,840
and becoming more and more difficult as it becomes illegal to be a good therapist,

949
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:25,240
which it already is, by the way,

950
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:27,720
because it's now illegal to tell your clients what you think.

951
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:31,360
And so that's the end of that enterprise, because that's all there was to it.

952
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:35,120
So but. Therapy is.

953
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:40,000
It's it's dialogue in search of its dialogue.

954
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,080
Look, it's a religious enterprise.

955
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:45,800
It's motivated by love.

956
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:46,960
What's our aim here?

957
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:49,320
Therapeutic aid to make things better.

958
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:52,320
Why? Because we think it's worthy.

959
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:55,360
It's a worthy enterprise to make things better.

960
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:57,360
That's the proclamation of love, right?

961
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:59,560
Love aims at making things better.

962
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:02,680
Love aims at making the world more abundant.

963
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:05,800
It aims at reducing unnecessary suffering, right?

964
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:07,640
It's an ennobling enterprise love.

965
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:11,840
And so the therapeutic process aims at love and uses truth.

966
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:14,000
And that's a religious enterprise.

967
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,600
It's a logos enterprise.

968
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:17,600
It's a dialogical enterprise.

969
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:21,040
And it's a form of secularized religious practice.

970
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:23,840
So one last question.

971
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:24,840
I know you're doing things.

972
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:26,600
You're you go all over the world.

973
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:29,400
You got friends and fans everywhere.

974
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:32,080
You started in some kind of organization.

975
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:36,800
My last question is, how are you going to save the world?

976
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:40,440
One person at a time.

977
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:42,000
Right, that's always how it's happened.

978
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,920
You know, what's the leftist mantra?

979
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:45,960
The long march through the institutions.

980
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:49,280
Well, how do you combat that with the longer

981
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:52,280
march through the individuals, right?

982
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:55,760
There's the rest of it's an illusion in a way.

983
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:59,680
There are individuals, right?

984
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:01,800
That's where the rubber hits the road.

985
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:04,480
Individuals suffer.

986
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:07,280
Individuals bear responsibility, right?

987
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:12,120
One of the one of the gifts, I suppose, that

988
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:16,160
the biblical corpus gave to the UK,

989
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:20,480
the UK transformed into political wisdom and transmitted to the US

990
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:23,920
was the proposition that the individual was the proper

991
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:27,400
unit of analysis, the fundamental unit of analysis.

992
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:30,000
And I believe that that's the case, which is why I'm a psychologist,

993
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,600
as I said, and not a sociologist or a political operative.

994
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:37,760
It's it's the the road.

995
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:42,720
It's it's always been the case that the route to heaven and away from hell

996
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:45,240
is the root of the individual soul.

997
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:50,040
And I believe that that's it's theologically true.

998
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:51,200
It's metaphysically true.

999
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:53,320
It's philosophically true.

1000
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:57,280
I also believe that it's materially true, right?

1001
01:01:57,320 --> 01:02:01,440
Insofar as that sort of truth can be instantiated materially.

1002
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:03,240
It's true at every level, simultaneous.

1003
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:06,000
In agreeing with that, I will say

1004
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:09,960
all of the greatest philosopher, political philosophers

1005
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:13,520
and all of the greatest greatest statesmen thought precisely that

1006
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:19,280
the purpose of the nation or the regime is the happiness of its people.

1007
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:23,800
And they come together to help make it, but each has to make his own.

1008
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:27,560
And that I think that's a very beautiful way.

1009
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:29,960
That's how the founders of America organized the country.

1010
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:33,160
And my own view is.

1011
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:38,440
Beautiful things cannot abidingly lose their luster.

1012
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:42,040
And I will say that in our time, which is a desperate time,

1013
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:47,240
your success and influence is one of the key signs that I'm right about that.

1014
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:49,560
Thank you for being with me.

1015
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:52,840
Thank you, sir. It's always a pleasure to be at Hillsdale and to see you.
