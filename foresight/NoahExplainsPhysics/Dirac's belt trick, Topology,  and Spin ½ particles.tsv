0	19280	To perform the Dirac belt trick, you'll need two things, one a belt and two a large book.
19280	24800	The book is to keep one end of the belt in place while the other moves around.
24800	34280	To begin, take the free end of the belt and turn it by 360 degrees.
34280	37280	You will now see a twist in the belt.
37280	41100	The goal is to find a way to take out this twist.
41100	45320	What makes this interesting is that you're not allowed to rotate either end of the belt,
45320	48800	so you can't just directly undo the twist.
48800	54000	However, you are allowed to move both ends around in space, as long as you don't turn
54000	56760	them while doing so.
56760	61200	Now you have to try this for yourself to be convinced, but no matter what you do, you
61200	64200	won't be able to undo the twist in the belt.
64200	66440	So that was a big failure.
66440	72720	However, in the beginning, instead of twisting the belt by 360 degrees, what if we instead
72720	78880	twisted it by 720 degrees, which is two full rotations?
78880	81600	Can we undo the twist now?
81760	84760	Well, watch this.
89960	91200	Amazing.
91200	98080	We can't undo a 360-degree twist, but we can undo a 720-degree twist.
98080	101360	That's the Dirac Belt Trick.
101360	105840	Paul Dirac, one of the greatest physicists of all time, invented this trick in order
105840	111000	to help explain to his students the bizarre nature of quantum spin one-half particles,
111000	114000	such as electrons and protons.
114000	117960	An older version of this trick was popularized in the book Riddles of the Sphinx and Other
117960	121400	Mathematical Puzzletales by Martin Gardner.
121400	125400	For this older trick, the first step is to put your belt back on.
125400	130080	Then get a pair of scissors and two pieces of string about 10 feet long.
130080	135280	Thread the strings through the holes in the scissors and tie off the ends in two loops.
135280	139720	Now step on the two loops of string and hold the scissors right in front of you straight
139720	141080	up.
141080	146200	Then rotate the scissors around by 720 degrees.
146200	150680	Once again, you can take out the twist and the strings by moving the pair of scissors
150680	153760	without rotating them.
153760	156960	But this is sort of dumb, so let's just stick with the belt.
156960	160680	Anyway, what does any of this have to do with quantum mechanics?
160680	166440	Well, if you take a normal object, like this soup can, and rotate it 360 degrees, it'll
166440	171440	end up exactly how it started.
171440	173960	But now let's say you have an electron.
173960	178040	We'll paint a little plus sign on it so we can see how it's oriented.
178040	183800	Let's see what happens when we rotate this electron by 360 degrees.
183800	186260	What?
186260	187800	What happened to the plus sign?
187800	189800	All I see is a stupid minus sign.
189800	194000	Well, let's keep rotating it and see if that helps.
195000	197960	Ah, look, it's the plus sign again.
197960	203400	So we can see that when we rotate an electron by 360 degrees, it doesn't return to its
203400	208120	original state, but rather a negated version of its original state.
208120	214760	However, when we rotate it by 720 degrees, then we get back the original state.
214760	220160	This is the property of the electron, that the Dirac Belt Trick attempts to explain.
220160	226960	Now at this point, you may be saying, wait, a 360 degree rotation is a 360 degree rotation.
226960	229080	You can't say it's only a half.
229080	233680	Well, in order to explain this trick more precisely, I'm going to have to introduce
233680	238320	some concepts from the branches of mathematics known as group theory and topology, which
238320	240280	will take some time.
240280	244040	Having said that, I think it's well worth the effort, because the story of the Dirac
244040	250080	Belt Trick is, in my opinion, one of the most wonderful and fundamental in all of physics.
250080	264320	Imagine you wanted to rotate this snowman.
264320	266600	You would have to specify two things.
266600	273440	One, an axis of rotation, and two, an angle of rotation.
274360	280680	Now, we could rotate any object we want, and admittedly this snowman is a little silly.
280680	284600	So let's instead use these coordinate axes.
284600	292640	We can once again choose an axis, and an angle to rotate it by.
292640	296960	Throughout this video, whenever I rotate these coordinate axes, I'll always include the
296960	300640	ghostly image of its original orientation.
300640	305600	Now from here on out, let's always measure angles using radians instead of degrees.
305600	312400	So for instance, pi over two radians is 90 degrees, pi radians is 180 degrees, 2 pi radians
312400	317760	is 360 degrees, and 4 pi radians is 720 degrees.
317760	323520	Anyway, to recap, you can specify a rotation with two pieces of information.
323520	328600	One, an axis, and two, an angle.
328600	332200	We'll define the rotation to always go in the counterclockwise direction around the
332200	337200	axis in accordance with the standard right hand rule, which says that if you point your
337200	341800	thumb in the direction of the axis, then you rotate in the same direction that your fingers
341800	343560	are curling.
343560	348720	Now let's package these two pieces of information together in a different way.
348720	354800	Instead of using an axis and an angle, let's use a single vector, which points in the direction
354800	361200	of the axis, but has the length of the angle theta measured in radians.
361200	368720	So using this, how can we understand what the space of all rotations is?
368720	375400	Abstractly, the space of rotations is a set, and individual points contained in the set
375400	378880	each correspond to one rotation.
378880	384200	Concretely, we can picture the space of rotations as follows.
384200	389400	Here we have a three-dimensional ball with a radius of pi.
389400	392420	Now consider a point contained in this ball.
392420	397560	This point corresponds to a rotation, namely the one given by the vector, which has its
397560	402780	base at the center of the ball and its tip on the point itself.
402780	407840	This vector will have a length ranging from 0 to pi because the ball itself has a radius
407840	409360	of pi.
409360	415640	Remember, the direction of this vector corresponds to the axis of rotation and its length corresponds
415640	418680	to the angle of rotation.
418680	423160	To let you soak this in, I'm going to show the vector in the space of rotations on the
423160	427120	right and the rotation it corresponds to on the left.
439360	469200	Now, there's actually something kind of funny about the space of rotations.
469920	476760	Notice that if you rotate around an axis by exactly pi radians in the clockwise direction,
476760	482760	the result is exactly the same as if you had rotated by pi radians in the counterclockwise
482760	488640	direction.
488640	499520	Therefore, this means that a point on the boundary of our ball corresponds to the exact
499520	505960	same rotation as the antipodal point on the other side of the boundary.
505960	513200	So, we can have a point in the space of rotations go out to the boundary and come back out the
513200	515760	other side.
515760	520920	While it looks like the point has jumped discontinuously, this is actually just an artifact of our
520920	522440	visualization.
522440	527760	So, it's actually not quite correct to say that the space of rotations is a ball of
527760	529440	radius pi.
529440	535160	We also have to include this extra stipulation, which says that antipodal points on the boundary
535160	539600	of this ball are equivalent to each other.
539600	542680	Let's now give a summary of part one.
542680	549080	It takes two pieces of information to specify a rotation, an axis and an angle.
549080	554240	Alternatively, we can use a vector, which points in the direction of the axis and has
554240	556560	the length of the angle.
556560	561560	We can visualize the space of rotations as a ball of radius pi, where each point in
561560	564800	the ball is one rotation.
564800	570680	We must identify antipodal points on the boundary of the ball because clockwise and counterclockwise
570680	587600	rotations around an axis by 180 degrees are really the same.
587600	592400	Now that we understand the space of rotations, let's think about pads through the space of
592400	594480	rotations.
594480	596920	Here is an example of a path.
596920	605000	It's sort of like a monorail with a point going around it in one direction.
605000	610000	Here I've displayed the point going around the path alongside the rotation it corresponds
610000	624840	to.
624840	626720	Enter the belt.
626720	631320	If you think about it, a belt is a lot like a path because it has a start point and an
631320	632720	end point.
632720	638360	As we'll see, it turns out that a belt does indeed correspond to a path through the space
638360	640920	of rotations.
640920	642360	Here's how.
642360	644480	Choose a point along the belt.
644480	650480	Now have the x-axis point along the length of the belt, the y-axis point perpendicular
650480	658360	to the belt, and the z-axis point along the width of the belt.
658360	663560	Now as we move down the belt, our axes will change accordingly.
663560	669260	Because every orientation of these axes corresponds to a rotation, we can see that the belt really
669260	674040	does trace out a path in the space of rotations.
674040	678920	Let's look at some concrete examples.
678920	698960	Here is a path that rotates around the x-axis by an ever-increasing angle.
698960	721120	Now let's do the same thing around the y-axis.
721120	743280	And here's a version around the z-axis.
743280	751720	Here's a more arbitrary shaped path.
751720	753840	This looks kind of messed up though.
753840	756480	Okay, this one is important.
756480	761720	This is the trivial path, the path that just stays right at the center of the ball.
761720	767640	Note that the belt corresponding to the trivial path is completely straight.
767640	773000	Okay, now let's talk about the belt trick again.
773000	780000	Remember what I said the rules of the belt trick are?
780000	784280	What makes this interesting is that you're not allowed to rotate either end of the belt,
784280	787560	so you can't just directly undo the twist.
787560	792880	However, you are allowed to move both ends around in space, as long as you don't turn
792880	798880	them while doing so.
798880	802280	What does it mean that you can't rotate the ends of the belt?
802800	805360	Well let's look at this path.
805360	810280	Notice that it starts and ends at the middle.
810280	822800	That means that the axes start and end completely unrotated.
822800	830080	But let's look at what happens when we change the endpoint of the path.
830080	835440	Notice that if the path doesn't end at the same place it starts, then the final configuration
835440	838720	of the axes won't be unrotated.
838720	843800	Therefore, our stipulation that you can't rotate the end of the belt means that our
843800	850720	path in rotation space must end at the same place that it begins.
850720	854000	Now what was the goal of the belt trick?
854000	857880	The goal is to find a way to take out this twist.
857880	862000	Notice that a perfectly straight belt with no twist in it corresponds to the trivial
862000	863560	path.
863560	871120	That means that making the belt straight corresponds to contracting the entire path down to a point.
871120	874720	Now for the path we have here, that's very easy to do.
874720	879160	However, let's look at the belt with a 2-pi twist in it.
879160	884160	Remember, this was the path we weren't able to undo at the beginning.
884160	890840	And indeed, no matter how hard you try, you won't be able to contract this path.
890840	897680	Intuitively, this is because the two points on the boundary are actually the same point.
897680	902240	But if we wanted to contract this path, we'd somehow have to bring these two points next
902240	903480	to each other.
903480	907840	But we can't do that because they always have to remain antipodal.
907840	916080	Now what about the path with a 4-pi twist in it?
916080	919680	Let's separate out the two strands of this path a little, just so we can get a better
919680	921240	look at it.
921240	925920	Now remember, earlier I was able to get the twist out of this belt.
925920	952360	So let's see what that looks like here.
952360	962760	I know that was a lot to take in, so let's look over this a bit slower.
962760	966800	Here is the path corresponding to a 4-pi twist.
966800	970880	Here I've labeled the two pairs of antipodal points.
970880	975880	For instance, the two points labeled A are really just two manifestations of the same
975880	980320	point.
980320	990040	Now let's watch how this path can be contracted.
990040	991360	Did you see that?
991360	993680	Let's look at it again.
993680	999720	Notice how the points A and B are approaching each other, which allows one part of the path
999720	1006040	to be pulled through the boundary and come out the other side.
1006040	1008000	Pretty neat, right?
1008000	1012640	Here's another way to understand how this path can be contracted.
1012640	1017040	This time, I've kept the path straight instead of curved and colored the two different branches
1017040	1025920	slightly different shades of gray.
1025920	1030040	Let's see how these paths through the space of rotations act on our snowman at different
1030040	1056600	stages of the contraction.
1056600	1080200	Notice that there are essentially two rotations going on, which I've labeled one and two.
1080200	1086160	The contraction works by making the axes go from being parallel to antiparallel and then
1086200	1091800	decreasing their respective angles of rotation.
1091800	1095480	So let's give a summary of part two.
1095480	1101280	Each configuration of the belt corresponds to a path through the space of rotations.
1101280	1106040	The trivial path corresponds to a perfectly straight belt.
1106040	1110560	Some paths can be contracted to a single point without having to move their start point or
1110560	1112760	their end point.
1112760	1117200	The Dirac Belt Trick is a demonstration of the fact that the path corresponding to a
1117200	1122800	two-pi twist can't be contracted to the trivial path, while the path corresponding to a four-pi
1122800	1135800	twist can.
1135800	1138440	Allow me to introduce some notation.
1138440	1145320	This expression should be read as g is an element of g, that is, the lowercase g is
1145320	1151000	one element of the set named uppercase g.
1151000	1154480	With that out of the way, let's talk about groups.
1154480	1163000	The word group in mathematics has a very specific meaning, namely a group is a set with an operation.
1163000	1167920	More specifically, there are four rules that this operation must satisfy.
1167920	1177240	The first rule is that if g1 and g2 are elements of the set g, then g1 plus g2 must also be
1177240	1180600	an element of the set g.
1180600	1184080	Here we're denoting our operation with the plus symbol.
1184080	1191840	We could have used a number of other symbols, but let's stick with this.
1191840	1197000	The second rule is that there must be some element of the group, which we call id, which
1197000	1204000	is short for identity, such that for any other element of the group g, g plus id is equal
1204000	1206320	to g.
1206320	1212840	The third rule is that if you add g1 and g2 together and then add it to g3, the result
1212840	1219960	will be the same as if you added g1 to the sum of g2 and g3.
1219960	1225520	The fourth rule is that for any element g, there must be some other element, which we'll
1225520	1233360	call negative g, such that g plus negative g is equal to the identity.
1233360	1238920	Here negative g is called the inverse of g.
1238920	1247760	These four rules are the exact rigorous definition for what mathematicians call a group.
1247760	1250480	Now this is all a bit abstract.
1250480	1252360	What's an example of a group?
1252360	1256680	Well one example is the set of rotations.
1256680	1264040	Take for instance the rotation around the x-axis by pi, and the rotation around the
1264040	1268080	y-axis by pi.
1268080	1270800	How do we add these together?
1270800	1276040	Well for rotations, plus just means that we do the first rotation first, and the second
1276040	1277920	rotation second.
1277920	1285040	So to add these together, first let's rotate around the x-axis by pi, and then let's rotate
1285040	1288880	around the y-axis by pi.
1288880	1294400	Now notice that this final rotation is exactly the same as if we had just rotated around
1294400	1302160	the z-axis by pi.
1302160	1311840	So hopefully you can see how you can add two rotations together and get a third one.
1311840	1313800	What about the identity element?
1313800	1316760	Which rotation corresponds to id?
1316760	1326320	Well that'll just be the trivial rotation, the rotation where you don't do anything.
1326320	1327800	What about inverses?
1327800	1330320	How do we invert a rotation?
1330320	1337680	Well if a rotation involves rotating around some axis in the counterclockwise direction,
1337680	1343280	then we can undo it just by rotating in the clockwise direction.
1343280	1349680	So we can see that every rotation does indeed have an inverse.
1349680	1355400	So that wraps up the explanation for how rotations form a mathematical group.
1355400	1359520	This is a good opportunity for me to talk about matrices.
1359520	1364320	Let's write the actual mathematical formula for the rotation around the x-axis by an angle
1364320	1366320	of theta.
1366320	1371640	We express the rotation as a transformation on a position vector.
1371640	1380400	We can also write this as a 3x3 matrix acting on the original vector.
1380400	1385400	To explain what distinguishes rotation matrices from any old arbitrary matrix, we have to
1385400	1388080	discuss the inner product.
1388080	1391760	Say you have two three-dimensional vectors r1 and r2.
1391760	1398360	The inner product of r1 with r2, which can also be written as r1 transpose times r2,
1398360	1405160	is equal to the sum of the products of their components.
1405160	1410920	Geometrically, the inner product of two vectors is just the product of the lengths of the vectors
1410920	1414400	times the cosine of the angle between them.
1414400	1420160	Now notice that rotations preserve both lengths and relative angles.
1420160	1428840	This means that if you rotate both vectors together, their inner product won't change.
1428840	1434880	In other words, if we denote the rotation matrix with the letter uppercase r, then the inner
1434880	1442040	product of uppercase r times r1 and uppercase r times r2 is equal to the inner product of
1442040	1444480	r1 with r2.
1444480	1449320	For this equation to hold for any choice of position vectors, we need for the transpose
1449320	1456360	of the rotation matrix times itself to be equal to the identity matrix.
1456360	1461240	When we have this condition, we say that the matrix is orthogonal.
1461240	1466760	So we see that a matrix must be orthogonal if it represents a rotation.
1467520	1474320	Now we call the group of all rotation matrices SO3.
1474320	1481480	Here, the three just refers to the fact that the matrices are all three-dimensional.
1481480	1487960	The O stands for orthogonal and the S stands for special, which means that all the matrices
1487960	1490520	have determinant 1.
1490520	1494680	This is just because we don't want any matrices that would flip the orientation of our axes
1494920	1498560	and have determinant minus 1, but let's not get into that.
1498560	1504800	So from here on out, whenever I say SO3, remember that I'm talking about the group of all rotations
1504800	1509960	of three-dimensional space.
1509960	1513880	One of the nice things about group theory is that, because the definition of a group
1513880	1518360	is so general, it applies in many different situations.
1518360	1522280	Here is another completely different example of a group.
1522360	1526440	First, begin by choosing any topological space.
1526440	1531800	For example, here is the two-dimensional torus, which we call T2.
1531800	1535240	Note that this torus is hollow and isn't filled in.
1535240	1542120	Next, choose one arbitrary point on the torus, which we will call the base point.
1542120	1547400	Consider a path on the torus that starts and ends at this base point.
1547400	1551640	Remember that you can imagine the path like a little monorail track with the train going
1551640	1553720	around in one direction.
1553720	1558840	Importantly, the path is directed, so if the train were to go around in the other direction,
1558840	1562680	we would consider that a distinct path.
1562680	1568440	Furthermore, we'll consider any two paths to be the same if they can be continuously
1568440	1572040	deformed into one another.
1573960	1580760	Finally, we define pi1 of T2, which we call the fundamental group of the torus,
1580760	1585880	to be the set of all paths which start and end at the base point.
1585880	1589880	Now, even though we used the explicit example of the torus,
1589880	1596280	every topological space has its own associated fundamental group.
1596280	1602120	Now, you may be asking, wait, how can we add two paths together?
1602120	1606520	To answer that, let's look at a different topological space.
1606520	1612120	Here we have a two-dimensional disc with two holes cut out of it.
1612120	1615800	Now let's choose an arbitrary base point, as well as two paths,
1615800	1621880	p1 and p2. Here is our little train going around the first path, p1,
1621880	1625960	and here it is going around the second path, p2.
1625960	1632520	Now, to define the path p1 plus p2, we just have the train go around p1,
1632520	1636200	and then go around p2.
1636200	1641400	We can continuously deform this path to get a better look at it.
1642120	1645880	All right, so what then is the inverse of a path?
1645880	1649560	Well, if here we have a path p where the train goes around
1649560	1653080	in one direction, then negative p is the path
1653080	1657640	where the train goes around in the other direction.
1659240	1664200	The path p plus negative p can always be deformed to the trivial path,
1664200	1667880	which is the identity element of the group.
1672760	1677720	So now that we know what the fundamental group is, let me ask you a question.
1677720	1683560	What is the fundamental group of SO3?
1683800	1687000	Here we have a bit of groupception, because I'm asking
1687000	1691480	what is the fundamental group of a group?
1692200	1696360	Well, here's SO3. Remember, this is just our old friend,
1696360	1702280	the space of rotations. I've put the base point right in the center.
1702280	1706600	Now, here is the only non-trivial path in SO3,
1706600	1712440	corresponding to the 2-pi twist. If we add this path to itself, we get the
1712440	1717480	4-pi twist, which can be contracted to the identity.
1718200	1725240	Therefore, p plus p equals id. We could also rephrase this as p
1725240	1729640	equals negative p, which is just because p can be continuously deformed
1729640	1732600	into its inverse.
1737320	1743720	Therefore, the fundamental group of SO3 only has two elements.
1744200	1749960	Here is the full table for how you can add these two elements together.
1751240	1757080	This is the full description for the fundamental group of SO3.
1757080	1761240	Now, if we symbolically replace id with zero
1761240	1767960	and p with one, then this table begins to look a little familiar.
1768760	1771960	Specifically, we can see that the fundamental group
1771960	1781080	of SO3 is just the integer's modulo 2, also known as z mod 2.
1782680	1787800	Think about all of the beautiful mathematics summed up in this equation.
1787800	1793000	The whole Dirac belt trick is just a demonstration of the fact that the
1793000	1799240	fundamental group of the space of rotations is z mod 2.
1799480	1804040	Now, if you'll indulge me for a moment, I'd like to talk about what makes
1804040	1808840	mathematics so non-trivial. SO3 is a good example of the kind of
1808840	1812360	object you see in math. You can think of it as a group,
1812360	1817080	and you can think of it as a topological space.
1817080	1820120	Therefore, we can study it using group theory,
1820120	1824600	or we can study it using topology. Often in mathematics,
1824600	1827480	you start by thinking about an object in one way,
1827480	1831880	and then discover you can think about it in a completely different way.
1831880	1835880	And, crucially, all the different ways to think about an object
1835880	1840600	interact with each other. So, the group theory has implications for the
1840600	1846360	topology, and the topology has implications for the group theory.
1847560	1851160	Let's give a summary of part three.
1851160	1857320	A group is a set with an operation that satisfies a handful of rules.
1857320	1861720	The set of rotations forms a group. Rotations can be expressed using
1861720	1865080	matrices, and the group of rotation matrices is
1865080	1869720	denoted SO3. Every topological space has a group
1869720	1873080	associated with it, called its fundamental group,
1873080	1878120	which is the set of paths which start and end at a base point.
1878120	1883240	The fundamental group of SO3 is z mod 2.
1887960	1898200	It's finally time to discuss spin in quantum mechanics.
1898200	1903400	You're probably used to thinking of vectors with an x, y, and z component.
1903400	1907320	Normally, we'd say that vectors are elements of the set R3,
1907320	1910680	because they're comprised of three real numbers.
1910680	1913640	However, quantum spin vectors are a little different.
1913640	1916760	They're instead comprised of two complex numbers,
1916840	1919720	where here alpha and beta are the complex numbers,
1919720	1924440	and thus we say that they are elements of the set C2.
1924440	1928440	Remember that a complex number can be written as a plus bi,
1928440	1931640	where a is the real part and b is the imaginary part.
1931640	1935240	We can also write it as r times e to the i theta,
1935240	1938760	using Euler's formula to express it in terms of a
1938760	1944120	magnitude r and an angle theta. The other thing about complex numbers is
1944120	1946520	that they can be quote-unquote conjugated.
1946520	1952840	So, for instance, the conjugate of alpha would be a minus bi.
1952840	1955960	Finally, the absolute value squared of a complex number
1955960	1958440	is just the number times its conjugate,
1958440	1965160	which is equal to a squared plus b squared, also known as r squared.
1965160	1969560	Now, what do these complex numbers correspond to in the physical world?
1969560	1973240	Well, say you had an electron whose spin vector had the components
1973240	1977560	of alpha and beta. If you measure the direction of the
1977560	1981720	electron's spin along the z-axis, then the probability that you find
1981720	1986360	it to be spin up will be the absolute value of alpha squared.
1986360	1989720	Meanwhile, the probability that you find it to be spin down
1989720	1993640	will be the absolute value of beta squared.
1993640	1997560	So, for instance, the state with components one and zero
1997560	2000840	will be measured to be spin up 100 percent of the time,
2000920	2004760	while the state with components zero and one will be measured to be
2004760	2008920	spin down 100 percent of the time.
2011720	2015560	Notice that, because all probabilities must sum to one,
2015560	2019640	the absolute value of alpha squared plus the absolute value of beta squared
2019640	2022760	must be equal to one.
2024760	2029480	Now, as we discussed previously, vectors in r3 have an inner product where you
2029480	2034120	take the transpose of one vector and multiply it by the other.
2034120	2037880	Quantum spin vectors, however, have an inner product where you take the
2037880	2043960	conjugate transpose of one vector and then multiply it by the other.
2045000	2049400	Just to be clear, in order to take the conjugate transpose of a spin vector,
2049400	2053320	you just complex conjugate the components and turn the column vector
2053320	2056360	into a row vector.
2057160	2061080	Now, you can use this inner product in order to extract the components of these
2061080	2064920	spin vectors. For instance, the inner product of one
2064920	2071240	zero with alpha beta is just alpha. Likewise, the inner product of zero
2071240	2076040	one with alpha beta is just beta.
2077640	2080760	Therefore, the probability to measure an electron to be
2080760	2084840	spin up with respect to the z-axis is the absolute value squared
2084840	2089080	of the inner product of the spin up state with alpha beta.
2089080	2093800	Likewise, the probability to be spin down with respect to the z-axis
2093800	2097240	is the absolute value squared of the inner product of the spin
2097240	2100760	down state with alpha beta.
2103800	2107400	Now, there's nothing fundamentally special about the z-axis.
2107400	2111880	Here, I'll write the spin up and down states with respect to the x-axis
2111880	2118280	and y-axis as well. So, the probability of a state to be, say,
2118280	2122600	measured spin down along the y-axis will be the absolute value squared
2122600	2127400	of the inner product of the spin down y-state with alpha beta.
2127400	2131720	And likewise, you would have the same thing for being, say, spin up along the x-axis
2131720	2134520	or what have you.
2137240	2140200	So, whereas the inner product of position vectors
2140200	2144360	is used to find lengths and angles, the inner product of our complex two
2144360	2150600	dimensional spin vectors is used to find the probabilities of measurements.
2151960	2155160	Now, we can also use the inner product to re-express
2155160	2159160	another equation that we've seen. Remember that the condition that
2159160	2163320	probabilities must sum to one implies that the absolute value of alpha
2163320	2167400	squared plus the absolute value of beta squared must be equal to one.
2167400	2171240	This is equivalent to saying that the inner product of a spin vector
2171240	2175880	with itself must be equal to one. When we have this condition,
2175880	2179880	we say that our spin vector is properly normalized or that we have a
2179880	2182680	physical state.
2186040	2189960	Now, let's talk about rotations. As we discussed earlier,
2189960	2194040	rotations act on vectors as three by three matrices.
2194040	2198360	In order to rotate a spin vector, however, we'll instead have to use a two
2198360	2202920	by two matrix with complex entries. We'll label this matrix with the
2202920	2206920	letter u. Remember that our rotation matrix
2206920	2210440	needed to satisfy the condition that the transpose of the matrix
2210440	2213960	times the matrix itself must be equal to the identity.
2213960	2219320	What is the analogous condition that this new matrix u must satisfy?
2220200	2226520	First off, rotating a spin vector shouldn't change the inner product of it
2226520	2229640	with itself. Because if that starts off as one, then it
2229640	2235080	should remain one after being rotated. In order for this to hold, we must have
2235080	2239240	that the conjugate transpose of u times u
2239240	2243720	is equal to the identity matrix. When we have this condition,
2243720	2248520	we say that u is a unitary matrix.
2251400	2255560	Now, aside from being unitary, there's one other slightly technical condition
2255560	2260280	that we need to put on u. First, note that the spin vectors with the
2260280	2264280	components of alpha, beta, and e to the i theta alpha,
2264280	2268600	e to the i theta beta, have no observable differences.
2268600	2272200	So, for example, when calculating the probability
2272200	2275800	that the second state is spin up along the z-axis,
2275800	2279080	the e to the i theta makes no difference in the final answer,
2279080	2283880	because you're just taking the absolute value squared of that inner product.
2283880	2286920	Physicists tend to call this factor of e to the i theta
2286920	2292280	a phase. Anyway, this implies that the matrix u
2292280	2298760	and e to the i theta times u correspond to the exact same transformation.
2298760	2302120	Therefore, to get rid of this redundancy, we can choose
2302120	2306280	for the determinant of u to be equal to one.
2306280	2309720	Finally, we denote the set of all such matrices u
2309720	2315960	that satisfy these conditions as su2. The two refers to the fact that the
2315960	2319560	matrices are two-dimensional, the u refers to the fact that they're
2319560	2323880	unitary, and the s stands for special, which means that the matrices have
2323880	2326440	determinant one.
2330040	2336680	So, to summarize part four, quantum spin states are vectors in c2.
2336680	2340360	The inner product of spin vectors involves taking the conjugate transpose
2340360	2344360	of one vector and multiplying it by the second one.
2344360	2347720	There are states which are always spin up or spin down
2347720	2351160	when measured with respect to certain directions in space.
2351160	2354600	The probability that a state will be spin up in some direction
2354600	2358520	will be the absolute value squared of its inner product with the spin up
2358520	2361800	vector. In order to rotate a spin state, you
2361800	2367080	must act on it by a matrix u in su2.
2367320	2381960	Earlier, we got acquainted with s03 as a topological space.
2381960	2385400	So, what about su2?
2387160	2390280	Well, first let's write the 2 by 2 matrix u
2390280	2394440	and call its four entries a, b, c, and d.
2394440	2397800	Now, remember that u conjugate transpose times u
2397800	2402680	must be equal to the identity matrix. This is equivalent to saying that u
2402680	2407320	conjugate transpose must be equal to u inverse.
2407320	2411560	If we write out this equation explicitly
2411560	2417080	and use the fact that the determinant of u is equal to one,
2417080	2420680	then after staring at this verbit, we realize that d
2420680	2424840	must be equal to the conjugate of a, and c must be equal to
2424840	2429080	minus the conjugate of b. Plugging these equations back in,
2429080	2432680	we see that u must have the entries of a, b,
2432680	2438040	negative b conjugate, and a conjugate. Now, notice that the determinant of this
2438040	2441160	matrix is equal to the absolute value of a squared
2441160	2445240	plus the absolute value of b squared. If we write
2445240	2451000	a equals x plus i, y, and b equals z plus i, w,
2451000	2454280	then the condition that this matrix has determinant one
2454280	2458600	becomes x squared plus y squared plus z squared plus w squared
2458600	2463160	equals one. So, this is all just to say that a completely
2463160	2467240	general su2 matrix can be given by four real numbers
2467240	2471880	x, y, z, and w such that x squared plus y squared plus z squared plus w
2471880	2476440	squared equals one. This is the equation for something called
2476440	2481320	the three sphere, which we denote s3.
2487320	2492120	How do we picture this three sphere? Well, you might be familiar with the two
2492120	2495480	sphere, which is given by the equation x squared plus y
2495480	2500760	squared plus z squared equals one. The two sphere, which is hollow much
2500760	2504360	like a beach ball, can be embedded in three-dimensional space,
2504360	2508920	which allows us to easily visualize it. The three sphere,
2508920	2512600	on the other hand, is embedded in four-dimensional space,
2512600	2516120	which makes it much harder to picture. However,
2516120	2520280	there is something we can do. Let's look again at the two sphere.
2520280	2523960	You can divide it into two halves along the equator.
2523960	2528040	You can then cut the sphere, flatten out the two pieces,
2528040	2532440	and get two discs. These discs can be thought of as
2532440	2535880	the set of points with x squared plus y squared
2535880	2540200	less than or equal to one in the 2D plane.
2540200	2545000	Anyway, let's refer to these discs as sheets.
2547400	2552440	Here's a side-by-side view of the sphere and its two sheets.
2552440	2555560	We can see what it looks like for a point to move around on the sphere
2555560	2558920	from the perspective of the sheets.
2561480	2564600	Notice that when the point hits the boundary of one sheet,
2564600	2567880	it emerges on the other sheet.
2572760	2576360	Therefore, we can see that the two sphere is equivalent to
2576360	2581080	two different discs glued along their boundary.
2581240	2588600	Now we can return to the three sphere. By direct analogy, the three sphere can be
2588600	2592360	pictured as two solid balls which are glued together along
2592360	2596520	their boundary. If a point hits the boundary of one
2596520	2600360	ball, it will emerge on the other.
2601000	2605720	Once again, we will refer to each ball as a sheet.
2605720	2610360	So how is this three sphere related to SO3?
2610360	2613640	Well, to discuss that, I'll need to introduce the concept
2613640	2620200	of a covering space. Here I have an example of a covering space
2620200	2626200	and a base space. In this example, the base space is just a circle and the
2626200	2632920	covering space is also a circle, but it's been sort of doubled over on itself.
2632920	2636760	Every point in the covering space can be projected down
2636760	2641640	to a point in the base space. In this example, the projection map is a
2641640	2644760	two-to-one function.
2645960	2649640	But instead, what if we want to take a point in the base space
2649640	2653880	and lift it to a point in the covering space?
2653880	2658840	Well, now there are two possible choices for a point we could lift it to.
2658840	2665080	Let's just choose the bottom point. Now let's see what happens if we move the
2665080	2668520	point in the base space around in a loop and then bring it back to its
2668520	2671400	original position.
2675000	2679640	Interesting, so even though we initially decided to lift to the bottom
2679640	2683000	choice, when we moved around in a loop, we were
2683000	2686840	forced to end up with the top choice.
2687560	2692200	Therefore, when we try to lift paths from the base space to the
2692200	2696360	covering space, sometimes the start point and the end point of the path
2696360	2699960	won't be the same in the covering space, even though they were the same in the
2699960	2702520	base space.
2703320	2707000	Now we are finally able to describe the relationship
2707000	2714920	between SU2 and SO3. SU2 is the covering space of SO3.
2714920	2718360	Just as in our example, this is a two-to-one covering,
2718360	2722360	which we call a double cover.
2723080	2726840	Just to get acquainted, let's see what happens when we move around a point
2726840	2729640	in the base space.
2730360	2747400	Now let's see what happens when we try to lift the path
2747400	2751320	corresponding to the two-pi twist.
2753320	2757960	Notice that in the covering space SU2, the start point of the path is
2757960	2761560	different from the end point of the path.
2770200	2773560	Interestingly, you could use this fact to rigorously prove
2773560	2777960	that the two-pi twist is non-contractable in SO3.
2777960	2783640	The proof follows by contradiction. If you could contract the path in SO3 to
2783640	2787480	the trivial path, then you could also continuously lift the
2787480	2792280	quote-unquote movie of the contraction to the covering space.
2792280	2796200	This would then get you a contraction of the lifted path as well.
2796200	2799640	However, because the start point in the covering space
2799640	2802600	is different from the end point in the covering space,
2802600	2805480	and because the start point and end point will always stay
2805480	2809720	anchored in their positions during this movie, then clearly we can't contract the
2809720	2813720	path in the covering space. Therefore, the path in the base space
2813720	2819640	must be non-contractable as well, which is exactly what we wanted to prove.
2822280	2826920	Actually, this proof is just one aspect of a more general phenomenon
2826920	2829800	where non-contractable paths in a base space
2829800	2835640	lift to paths which start and end at different points in a covering space.
2836200	2843000	To finish up this part of the video, let me just show you how the
2843000	2851560	four-pi twist can be contracted just for kicks.
2852440	2865960	Let's now give a summary of part five.
2865960	2873400	SU2 is equal to S3 as a topological space. You can picture S3 as two balls
2873400	2879000	glued along their boundaries, which you could also think of as the equator.
2879080	2885640	SU2 is a double cover of SO3. If you lift the path corresponding to the
2885640	2890440	two-pi twist in SO3 to SU2, then the start point
2890440	2893720	and the end point of the path will not be the same.
2893720	2897160	This fact can be used to prove that the two-pi twist
2897160	2908840	is non-contractable in SO3.
2909800	2917480	At the start of this video, I said that rotating an electron 360 degrees
2917480	2921640	puts it in a negated version of its original state.
2921640	2924680	Let's now synthesize all the math we've learned
2924680	2929720	in order to understand how this statement actually makes sense.
2929720	2934520	The group which acts on C2 spin vectors is SU2.
2934520	2938600	Therefore, to rotate an electron, we must lift a path
2938600	2945640	from SO3 to SU2. SU2 is a double cover of SO3,
2945640	2949720	and the two-pi twist ends up at a different element of SU2
2949720	2955960	than it started. More specifically, if we start the lifted path at the identity
2955960	2958760	matrix,
2958760	2966440	then it'll end up at negative the identity matrix.
2966440	2969800	However, the four-pi twist does end where it starts
2969800	2972440	in SU2.
2978440	2981720	Therefore, rotating an electron by two-pi
2981720	2985880	negates its spin vector while rotating it by four-pi
2985960	2992440	returns it to its original state. So that completes the explanation.
2992440	2996760	Just to write down some explicit equations, let me explain how to find the
2996760	3001560	SO3 rotation matrix corresponding to a matrix in SU2.
3001560	3005720	Start by taking a position vector, r equals xyz,
3005720	3009080	and convert it into the following two-by-two matrix,
3009080	3013880	r dot the polymatrices, which is just x times the first polymatrix
3013880	3018760	plus y times the second polymatrix plus z times the third polymatrix.
3018760	3021720	This is actually the most general form for a traceless
3021720	3025720	self-adjoint two-by-two matrix. Furthermore, the determinant of this
3025720	3029480	matrix is equal to x squared plus y squared plus z squared,
3029480	3034520	which is just the length squared of r. If we multiply this matrix by u on the
3034520	3037960	left and the conjugate transpose of u on the right,
3037960	3042040	the overall matrix will still be traceless and self-adjoint.
3042040	3045480	Furthermore, its determinant will be unchanged.
3045480	3049560	Therefore, we can write this new matrix as a new position vector,
3049560	3053640	which we call r prime, dotted with the polymatrices.
3053640	3056680	Because r and r prime must have the same length,
3056680	3061320	r prime must just be a rotated version of r.
3061320	3066600	So the rotation matrix, uppercase r, is just whatever three-by-three matrix
3066600	3070520	satisfies the equation r prime equals uppercase r
3070520	3075240	times r. This is how you convert an SU2 matrix u
3075240	3082440	into an SO3 matrix r. Now notice that u and negative u
3082440	3086440	map to the exact same rotation.
3087160	3090680	This is how we can see that SU2 really is a double cover
3090680	3093400	of SO3.
3094200	3097720	Finally, I should just mention that there's this really useful explicit
3097720	3102520	formula for the SU2 matrix u corresponding to a rotation
3102520	3105720	given an axis n hat and an angle of rotation
3105720	3111160	theta. Namely, u equals cosine of theta over 2
3111160	3115080	times the identity matrix plus sine of theta over 2
3115080	3120040	times negative i n hat dot the polymatrices.
3120040	3125000	Notice that if we plug in theta equals 2 pi, then u equals negative the identity
3125000	3128600	matrix, meaning a 2 pi rotation does negate the spin
3128600	3132840	vector of an electron. We can also write this using matrix
3132840	3135640	exponentiation, but let's not get into that.
3135640	3139640	Oof, glad I got that out of my chest.
3149560	3153560	Now, there are a few things you're probably wondering about.
3153560	3157640	First off, how do you actually rotate an electron?
3157640	3162440	Clearly, you can't just pick it up and rotate it like it's a tennis ball.
3162440	3166520	There are two ways to answer this question. The first is that
3166520	3170040	you can think of a rotation as the result of changing
3170040	3175480	reference frames. For example, say you have your electron,
3175480	3180200	put it on a table, and put that table in a room.
3180200	3185720	If you then walk around the electron and continuously describe its quantum spin
3185720	3196120	state using your own reference frame,
3197240	3200360	then when you've finished walking 2 pi radians around it,
3200360	3204760	the state of the electron will be negative. Now,
3204760	3208600	that's all fine and good, but there's also a more concrete way to rotate an
3208600	3212440	electron. You see, an electron's spin will create
3212440	3216280	an angular momentum vector which points in some direction.
3216280	3220600	If you then expose this electron to an external magnetic field,
3220600	3224680	it'll cause the angular momentum vector to rotate around the magnetic field
3224680	3228840	vector in a process known as Larmor procession.
3228840	3233160	Therefore, you can use magnetic fields to rotate electrons.
3233160	3236680	Here's something else you might be wondering. Is there any way we could
3236760	3242200	experimentally detect the minus sign which comes from a 2 pi rotation?
3242200	3249160	Amazingly, the answer is yes. Here's how. First, take your electron and then
3249160	3254120	put it in a quantum superposition at two different locations.
3254120	3259160	Then, subject one of them to a magnetic field, rotating it by 2 pi radians,
3259160	3265080	inducing the minus sign. Finally, recombine the electrons.
3265080	3270200	In the end, you'll find interference effects stemming from the minus sign.
3270200	3273640	This exact thing has actually already been done with neutrons.
3273640	3277960	Look up neutron interferometry for more details.
3277960	3283480	So, way back when I said that an overall phase has no observable consequences,
3283480	3287800	I was being a bit imprecise. You can detect overall phases in quantum
3287800	3290840	mechanics, but only if you make superpositions and
3290840	3295320	create interference experiments. Here's something else I wanted to tell
3295320	3299800	you about. Real projective space. If you take the
3299800	3303560	two sphere and identify antipodal points as the same
3303560	3306840	point, you create a topological space known as
3306840	3312600	RP2 or two-dimensional real projective space.
3313160	3317880	To reiterate, every pair of antipodal points on the two sphere
3317880	3324280	is just one point in RP2. We can write this in the language of
3324280	3329640	equivalence relations by saying that RP2 is s2 modulo the
3329640	3334200	equivalence relation that the point x, y, z is the same as
3334200	3340440	negative x, negative y, negative z. Now, this construction directly extends
3340440	3345880	to the three sphere. So, RP3 is just s3 modulo the equivalence
3345880	3349480	relation that antipodal points on the three sphere
3349480	3355160	are identified with each other. The relevance this has for us is that
3355160	3361160	topologically, s03 is RP3. This goes hand in hand with
3361160	3365480	s2 being s3 and gives us another way to understand
3365480	3370440	how s02 is the double cover of s03.
3370760	3376040	On the subject of this covering space business, let me point out that while
3376040	3381400	the fundamental group of s03 is z mod2, the fundamental group of s02
3381400	3384760	is the trivial group, the group with only one element, which is because all
3384760	3388120	paths can be contracted on the three sphere.
3388120	3392840	Note that the fundamental group of s03 then has twice the number of elements
3392840	3397480	as the fundamental group of s02. This fact is intimately related to the
3397480	3403720	fact that s02 is a double cover of s03 and not, say, a triple cover.
3403720	3406920	If this stuff intrigues you, you should probably go learn some algebraic
3406920	3409560	topology.
3410360	3415080	One other thing I wanted to mention is the hop vibration.
3415080	3418280	Okay, I've mentioned it.
3428120	3453720	The ancient philosophers, Euclid, Plato, etc, knew that the essence of the
3453720	3458120	universe was based on mathematics.
3458120	3463080	But they didn't know which mathematical objects it was based on.
3463080	3466920	Rather than, say, platonic solids or triangles,
3466920	3470280	the real building blocks of the universe are things like groups,
3470280	3474280	vector spaces, you know, stuff like that.
3476920	3481720	So it appears that nature is far more subtle and creative than we humans,
3481800	3485960	because not only did she make these bizarre spin-one-half objects,
3485960	3489480	she made a whole universe out of them.
3490840	3495640	But strangely, even nature isn't free to do whatever she wants.
3495640	3502360	She is constrained and constrained very severely by the laws of mathematics.
3502360	3508600	That non-contractable path in s03 is simply there no matter what.
3508600	3512520	So while nature could devise a spin-one-half particle,
3512520	3515960	she could never devise, say, a spin-one-third particle,
3515960	3519640	because the fundamental group of s03 is z mod 2
3519640	3524200	and not z mod 3. So while nature is creative,
3524200	3527800	that creativity can only exist within some very rigid
3527800	3533000	and maybe even tautological bounds. So when we study physics and mathematics
3533000	3536680	today, we still do, in the end, get that same
3536680	3542360	ancient platonic feeling, albeit with a spooky modern twist.
3542360	3544360	Thanks for watching.
