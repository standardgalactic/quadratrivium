00:00.000 --> 00:19.280
To perform the Dirac belt trick, you'll need two things, one a belt and two a large book.

00:19.280 --> 00:24.800
The book is to keep one end of the belt in place while the other moves around.

00:24.800 --> 00:34.280
To begin, take the free end of the belt and turn it by 360 degrees.

00:34.280 --> 00:37.280
You will now see a twist in the belt.

00:37.280 --> 00:41.100
The goal is to find a way to take out this twist.

00:41.100 --> 00:45.320
What makes this interesting is that you're not allowed to rotate either end of the belt,

00:45.320 --> 00:48.800
so you can't just directly undo the twist.

00:48.800 --> 00:54.000
However, you are allowed to move both ends around in space, as long as you don't turn

00:54.000 --> 00:56.760
them while doing so.

00:56.760 --> 01:01.200
Now you have to try this for yourself to be convinced, but no matter what you do, you

01:01.200 --> 01:04.200
won't be able to undo the twist in the belt.

01:04.200 --> 01:06.440
So that was a big failure.

01:06.440 --> 01:12.720
However, in the beginning, instead of twisting the belt by 360 degrees, what if we instead

01:12.720 --> 01:18.880
twisted it by 720 degrees, which is two full rotations?

01:18.880 --> 01:21.600
Can we undo the twist now?

01:21.760 --> 01:24.760
Well, watch this.

01:29.960 --> 01:31.200
Amazing.

01:31.200 --> 01:38.080
We can't undo a 360-degree twist, but we can undo a 720-degree twist.

01:38.080 --> 01:41.360
That's the Dirac Belt Trick.

01:41.360 --> 01:45.840
Paul Dirac, one of the greatest physicists of all time, invented this trick in order

01:45.840 --> 01:51.000
to help explain to his students the bizarre nature of quantum spin one-half particles,

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
such as electrons and protons.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.960
An older version of this trick was popularized in the book Riddles of the Sphinx and Other

01:57.960 --> 02:01.400
Mathematical Puzzletales by Martin Gardner.

02:01.400 --> 02:05.400
For this older trick, the first step is to put your belt back on.

02:05.400 --> 02:10.080
Then get a pair of scissors and two pieces of string about 10 feet long.

02:10.080 --> 02:15.280
Thread the strings through the holes in the scissors and tie off the ends in two loops.

02:15.280 --> 02:19.720
Now step on the two loops of string and hold the scissors right in front of you straight

02:19.720 --> 02:21.080
up.

02:21.080 --> 02:26.200
Then rotate the scissors around by 720 degrees.

02:26.200 --> 02:30.680
Once again, you can take out the twist and the strings by moving the pair of scissors

02:30.680 --> 02:33.760
without rotating them.

02:33.760 --> 02:36.960
But this is sort of dumb, so let's just stick with the belt.

02:36.960 --> 02:40.680
Anyway, what does any of this have to do with quantum mechanics?

02:40.680 --> 02:46.440
Well, if you take a normal object, like this soup can, and rotate it 360 degrees, it'll

02:46.440 --> 02:51.440
end up exactly how it started.

02:51.440 --> 02:53.960
But now let's say you have an electron.

02:53.960 --> 02:58.040
We'll paint a little plus sign on it so we can see how it's oriented.

02:58.040 --> 03:03.800
Let's see what happens when we rotate this electron by 360 degrees.

03:03.800 --> 03:06.260
What?

03:06.260 --> 03:07.800
What happened to the plus sign?

03:07.800 --> 03:09.800
All I see is a stupid minus sign.

03:09.800 --> 03:14.000
Well, let's keep rotating it and see if that helps.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.960
Ah, look, it's the plus sign again.

03:17.960 --> 03:23.400
So we can see that when we rotate an electron by 360 degrees, it doesn't return to its

03:23.400 --> 03:28.120
original state, but rather a negated version of its original state.

03:28.120 --> 03:34.760
However, when we rotate it by 720 degrees, then we get back the original state.

03:34.760 --> 03:40.160
This is the property of the electron, that the Dirac Belt Trick attempts to explain.

03:40.160 --> 03:46.960
Now at this point, you may be saying, wait, a 360 degree rotation is a 360 degree rotation.

03:46.960 --> 03:49.080
You can't say it's only a half.

03:49.080 --> 03:53.680
Well, in order to explain this trick more precisely, I'm going to have to introduce

03:53.680 --> 03:58.320
some concepts from the branches of mathematics known as group theory and topology, which

03:58.320 --> 04:00.280
will take some time.

04:00.280 --> 04:04.040
Having said that, I think it's well worth the effort, because the story of the Dirac

04:04.040 --> 04:10.080
Belt Trick is, in my opinion, one of the most wonderful and fundamental in all of physics.

04:10.080 --> 04:24.320
Imagine you wanted to rotate this snowman.

04:24.320 --> 04:26.600
You would have to specify two things.

04:26.600 --> 04:33.440
One, an axis of rotation, and two, an angle of rotation.

04:34.360 --> 04:40.680
Now, we could rotate any object we want, and admittedly this snowman is a little silly.

04:40.680 --> 04:44.600
So let's instead use these coordinate axes.

04:44.600 --> 04:52.640
We can once again choose an axis, and an angle to rotate it by.

04:52.640 --> 04:56.960
Throughout this video, whenever I rotate these coordinate axes, I'll always include the

04:56.960 --> 05:00.640
ghostly image of its original orientation.

05:00.640 --> 05:05.600
Now from here on out, let's always measure angles using radians instead of degrees.

05:05.600 --> 05:12.400
So for instance, pi over two radians is 90 degrees, pi radians is 180 degrees, 2 pi radians

05:12.400 --> 05:17.760
is 360 degrees, and 4 pi radians is 720 degrees.

05:17.760 --> 05:23.520
Anyway, to recap, you can specify a rotation with two pieces of information.

05:23.520 --> 05:28.600
One, an axis, and two, an angle.

05:28.600 --> 05:32.200
We'll define the rotation to always go in the counterclockwise direction around the

05:32.200 --> 05:37.200
axis in accordance with the standard right hand rule, which says that if you point your

05:37.200 --> 05:41.800
thumb in the direction of the axis, then you rotate in the same direction that your fingers

05:41.800 --> 05:43.560
are curling.

05:43.560 --> 05:48.720
Now let's package these two pieces of information together in a different way.

05:48.720 --> 05:54.800
Instead of using an axis and an angle, let's use a single vector, which points in the direction

05:54.800 --> 06:01.200
of the axis, but has the length of the angle theta measured in radians.

06:01.200 --> 06:08.720
So using this, how can we understand what the space of all rotations is?

06:08.720 --> 06:15.400
Abstractly, the space of rotations is a set, and individual points contained in the set

06:15.400 --> 06:18.880
each correspond to one rotation.

06:18.880 --> 06:24.200
Concretely, we can picture the space of rotations as follows.

06:24.200 --> 06:29.400
Here we have a three-dimensional ball with a radius of pi.

06:29.400 --> 06:32.420
Now consider a point contained in this ball.

06:32.420 --> 06:37.560
This point corresponds to a rotation, namely the one given by the vector, which has its

06:37.560 --> 06:42.780
base at the center of the ball and its tip on the point itself.

06:42.780 --> 06:47.840
This vector will have a length ranging from 0 to pi because the ball itself has a radius

06:47.840 --> 06:49.360
of pi.

06:49.360 --> 06:55.640
Remember, the direction of this vector corresponds to the axis of rotation and its length corresponds

06:55.640 --> 06:58.680
to the angle of rotation.

06:58.680 --> 07:03.160
To let you soak this in, I'm going to show the vector in the space of rotations on the

07:03.160 --> 07:07.120
right and the rotation it corresponds to on the left.

07:19.360 --> 07:49.200
Now, there's actually something kind of funny about the space of rotations.

07:49.920 --> 07:56.760
Notice that if you rotate around an axis by exactly pi radians in the clockwise direction,

07:56.760 --> 08:02.760
the result is exactly the same as if you had rotated by pi radians in the counterclockwise

08:02.760 --> 08:08.640
direction.

08:08.640 --> 08:19.520
Therefore, this means that a point on the boundary of our ball corresponds to the exact

08:19.520 --> 08:25.960
same rotation as the antipodal point on the other side of the boundary.

08:25.960 --> 08:33.200
So, we can have a point in the space of rotations go out to the boundary and come back out the

08:33.200 --> 08:35.760
other side.

08:35.760 --> 08:40.920
While it looks like the point has jumped discontinuously, this is actually just an artifact of our

08:40.920 --> 08:42.440
visualization.

08:42.440 --> 08:47.760
So, it's actually not quite correct to say that the space of rotations is a ball of

08:47.760 --> 08:49.440
radius pi.

08:49.440 --> 08:55.160
We also have to include this extra stipulation, which says that antipodal points on the boundary

08:55.160 --> 08:59.600
of this ball are equivalent to each other.

08:59.600 --> 09:02.680
Let's now give a summary of part one.

09:02.680 --> 09:09.080
It takes two pieces of information to specify a rotation, an axis and an angle.

09:09.080 --> 09:14.240
Alternatively, we can use a vector, which points in the direction of the axis and has

09:14.240 --> 09:16.560
the length of the angle.

09:16.560 --> 09:21.560
We can visualize the space of rotations as a ball of radius pi, where each point in

09:21.560 --> 09:24.800
the ball is one rotation.

09:24.800 --> 09:30.680
We must identify antipodal points on the boundary of the ball because clockwise and counterclockwise

09:30.680 --> 09:47.600
rotations around an axis by 180 degrees are really the same.

09:47.600 --> 09:52.400
Now that we understand the space of rotations, let's think about pads through the space of

09:52.400 --> 09:54.480
rotations.

09:54.480 --> 09:56.920
Here is an example of a path.

09:56.920 --> 10:05.000
It's sort of like a monorail with a point going around it in one direction.

10:05.000 --> 10:10.000
Here I've displayed the point going around the path alongside the rotation it corresponds

10:10.000 --> 10:24.840
to.

10:24.840 --> 10:26.720
Enter the belt.

10:26.720 --> 10:31.320
If you think about it, a belt is a lot like a path because it has a start point and an

10:31.320 --> 10:32.720
end point.

10:32.720 --> 10:38.360
As we'll see, it turns out that a belt does indeed correspond to a path through the space

10:38.360 --> 10:40.920
of rotations.

10:40.920 --> 10:42.360
Here's how.

10:42.360 --> 10:44.480
Choose a point along the belt.

10:44.480 --> 10:50.480
Now have the x-axis point along the length of the belt, the y-axis point perpendicular

10:50.480 --> 10:58.360
to the belt, and the z-axis point along the width of the belt.

10:58.360 --> 11:03.560
Now as we move down the belt, our axes will change accordingly.

11:03.560 --> 11:09.260
Because every orientation of these axes corresponds to a rotation, we can see that the belt really

11:09.260 --> 11:14.040
does trace out a path in the space of rotations.

11:14.040 --> 11:18.920
Let's look at some concrete examples.

11:18.920 --> 11:38.960
Here is a path that rotates around the x-axis by an ever-increasing angle.

11:38.960 --> 12:01.120
Now let's do the same thing around the y-axis.

12:01.120 --> 12:23.280
And here's a version around the z-axis.

12:23.280 --> 12:31.720
Here's a more arbitrary shaped path.

12:31.720 --> 12:33.840
This looks kind of messed up though.

12:33.840 --> 12:36.480
Okay, this one is important.

12:36.480 --> 12:41.720
This is the trivial path, the path that just stays right at the center of the ball.

12:41.720 --> 12:47.640
Note that the belt corresponding to the trivial path is completely straight.

12:47.640 --> 12:53.000
Okay, now let's talk about the belt trick again.

12:53.000 --> 13:00.000
Remember what I said the rules of the belt trick are?

13:00.000 --> 13:04.280
What makes this interesting is that you're not allowed to rotate either end of the belt,

13:04.280 --> 13:07.560
so you can't just directly undo the twist.

13:07.560 --> 13:12.880
However, you are allowed to move both ends around in space, as long as you don't turn

13:12.880 --> 13:18.880
them while doing so.

13:18.880 --> 13:22.280
What does it mean that you can't rotate the ends of the belt?

13:22.800 --> 13:25.360
Well let's look at this path.

13:25.360 --> 13:30.280
Notice that it starts and ends at the middle.

13:30.280 --> 13:42.800
That means that the axes start and end completely unrotated.

13:42.800 --> 13:50.080
But let's look at what happens when we change the endpoint of the path.

13:50.080 --> 13:55.440
Notice that if the path doesn't end at the same place it starts, then the final configuration

13:55.440 --> 13:58.720
of the axes won't be unrotated.

13:58.720 --> 14:03.800
Therefore, our stipulation that you can't rotate the end of the belt means that our

14:03.800 --> 14:10.720
path in rotation space must end at the same place that it begins.

14:10.720 --> 14:14.000
Now what was the goal of the belt trick?

14:14.000 --> 14:17.880
The goal is to find a way to take out this twist.

14:17.880 --> 14:22.000
Notice that a perfectly straight belt with no twist in it corresponds to the trivial

14:22.000 --> 14:23.560
path.

14:23.560 --> 14:31.120
That means that making the belt straight corresponds to contracting the entire path down to a point.

14:31.120 --> 14:34.720
Now for the path we have here, that's very easy to do.

14:34.720 --> 14:39.160
However, let's look at the belt with a 2-pi twist in it.

14:39.160 --> 14:44.160
Remember, this was the path we weren't able to undo at the beginning.

14:44.160 --> 14:50.840
And indeed, no matter how hard you try, you won't be able to contract this path.

14:50.840 --> 14:57.680
Intuitively, this is because the two points on the boundary are actually the same point.

14:57.680 --> 15:02.240
But if we wanted to contract this path, we'd somehow have to bring these two points next

15:02.240 --> 15:03.480
to each other.

15:03.480 --> 15:07.840
But we can't do that because they always have to remain antipodal.

15:07.840 --> 15:16.080
Now what about the path with a 4-pi twist in it?

15:16.080 --> 15:19.680
Let's separate out the two strands of this path a little, just so we can get a better

15:19.680 --> 15:21.240
look at it.

15:21.240 --> 15:25.920
Now remember, earlier I was able to get the twist out of this belt.

15:25.920 --> 15:52.360
So let's see what that looks like here.

15:52.360 --> 16:02.760
I know that was a lot to take in, so let's look over this a bit slower.

16:02.760 --> 16:06.800
Here is the path corresponding to a 4-pi twist.

16:06.800 --> 16:10.880
Here I've labeled the two pairs of antipodal points.

16:10.880 --> 16:15.880
For instance, the two points labeled A are really just two manifestations of the same

16:15.880 --> 16:20.320
point.

16:20.320 --> 16:30.040
Now let's watch how this path can be contracted.

16:30.040 --> 16:31.360
Did you see that?

16:31.360 --> 16:33.680
Let's look at it again.

16:33.680 --> 16:39.720
Notice how the points A and B are approaching each other, which allows one part of the path

16:39.720 --> 16:46.040
to be pulled through the boundary and come out the other side.

16:46.040 --> 16:48.000
Pretty neat, right?

16:48.000 --> 16:52.640
Here's another way to understand how this path can be contracted.

16:52.640 --> 16:57.040
This time, I've kept the path straight instead of curved and colored the two different branches

16:57.040 --> 17:05.920
slightly different shades of gray.

17:05.920 --> 17:10.040
Let's see how these paths through the space of rotations act on our snowman at different

17:10.040 --> 17:36.600
stages of the contraction.

17:36.600 --> 18:00.200
Notice that there are essentially two rotations going on, which I've labeled one and two.

18:00.200 --> 18:06.160
The contraction works by making the axes go from being parallel to antiparallel and then

18:06.200 --> 18:11.800
decreasing their respective angles of rotation.

18:11.800 --> 18:15.480
So let's give a summary of part two.

18:15.480 --> 18:21.280
Each configuration of the belt corresponds to a path through the space of rotations.

18:21.280 --> 18:26.040
The trivial path corresponds to a perfectly straight belt.

18:26.040 --> 18:30.560
Some paths can be contracted to a single point without having to move their start point or

18:30.560 --> 18:32.760
their end point.

18:32.760 --> 18:37.200
The Dirac Belt Trick is a demonstration of the fact that the path corresponding to a

18:37.200 --> 18:42.800
two-pi twist can't be contracted to the trivial path, while the path corresponding to a four-pi

18:42.800 --> 18:55.800
twist can.

18:55.800 --> 18:58.440
Allow me to introduce some notation.

18:58.440 --> 19:05.320
This expression should be read as g is an element of g, that is, the lowercase g is

19:05.320 --> 19:11.000
one element of the set named uppercase g.

19:11.000 --> 19:14.480
With that out of the way, let's talk about groups.

19:14.480 --> 19:23.000
The word group in mathematics has a very specific meaning, namely a group is a set with an operation.

19:23.000 --> 19:27.920
More specifically, there are four rules that this operation must satisfy.

19:27.920 --> 19:37.240
The first rule is that if g1 and g2 are elements of the set g, then g1 plus g2 must also be

19:37.240 --> 19:40.600
an element of the set g.

19:40.600 --> 19:44.080
Here we're denoting our operation with the plus symbol.

19:44.080 --> 19:51.840
We could have used a number of other symbols, but let's stick with this.

19:51.840 --> 19:57.000
The second rule is that there must be some element of the group, which we call id, which

19:57.000 --> 20:04.000
is short for identity, such that for any other element of the group g, g plus id is equal

20:04.000 --> 20:06.320
to g.

20:06.320 --> 20:12.840
The third rule is that if you add g1 and g2 together and then add it to g3, the result

20:12.840 --> 20:19.960
will be the same as if you added g1 to the sum of g2 and g3.

20:19.960 --> 20:25.520
The fourth rule is that for any element g, there must be some other element, which we'll

20:25.520 --> 20:33.360
call negative g, such that g plus negative g is equal to the identity.

20:33.360 --> 20:38.920
Here negative g is called the inverse of g.

20:38.920 --> 20:47.760
These four rules are the exact rigorous definition for what mathematicians call a group.

20:47.760 --> 20:50.480
Now this is all a bit abstract.

20:50.480 --> 20:52.360
What's an example of a group?

20:52.360 --> 20:56.680
Well one example is the set of rotations.

20:56.680 --> 21:04.040
Take for instance the rotation around the x-axis by pi, and the rotation around the

21:04.040 --> 21:08.080
y-axis by pi.

21:08.080 --> 21:10.800
How do we add these together?

21:10.800 --> 21:16.040
Well for rotations, plus just means that we do the first rotation first, and the second

21:16.040 --> 21:17.920
rotation second.

21:17.920 --> 21:25.040
So to add these together, first let's rotate around the x-axis by pi, and then let's rotate

21:25.040 --> 21:28.880
around the y-axis by pi.

21:28.880 --> 21:34.400
Now notice that this final rotation is exactly the same as if we had just rotated around

21:34.400 --> 21:42.160
the z-axis by pi.

21:42.160 --> 21:51.840
So hopefully you can see how you can add two rotations together and get a third one.

21:51.840 --> 21:53.800
What about the identity element?

21:53.800 --> 21:56.760
Which rotation corresponds to id?

21:56.760 --> 22:06.320
Well that'll just be the trivial rotation, the rotation where you don't do anything.

22:06.320 --> 22:07.800
What about inverses?

22:07.800 --> 22:10.320
How do we invert a rotation?

22:10.320 --> 22:17.680
Well if a rotation involves rotating around some axis in the counterclockwise direction,

22:17.680 --> 22:23.280
then we can undo it just by rotating in the clockwise direction.

22:23.280 --> 22:29.680
So we can see that every rotation does indeed have an inverse.

22:29.680 --> 22:35.400
So that wraps up the explanation for how rotations form a mathematical group.

22:35.400 --> 22:39.520
This is a good opportunity for me to talk about matrices.

22:39.520 --> 22:44.320
Let's write the actual mathematical formula for the rotation around the x-axis by an angle

22:44.320 --> 22:46.320
of theta.

22:46.320 --> 22:51.640
We express the rotation as a transformation on a position vector.

22:51.640 --> 23:00.400
We can also write this as a 3x3 matrix acting on the original vector.

23:00.400 --> 23:05.400
To explain what distinguishes rotation matrices from any old arbitrary matrix, we have to

23:05.400 --> 23:08.080
discuss the inner product.

23:08.080 --> 23:11.760
Say you have two three-dimensional vectors r1 and r2.

23:11.760 --> 23:18.360
The inner product of r1 with r2, which can also be written as r1 transpose times r2,

23:18.360 --> 23:25.160
is equal to the sum of the products of their components.

23:25.160 --> 23:30.920
Geometrically, the inner product of two vectors is just the product of the lengths of the vectors

23:30.920 --> 23:34.400
times the cosine of the angle between them.

23:34.400 --> 23:40.160
Now notice that rotations preserve both lengths and relative angles.

23:40.160 --> 23:48.840
This means that if you rotate both vectors together, their inner product won't change.

23:48.840 --> 23:54.880
In other words, if we denote the rotation matrix with the letter uppercase r, then the inner

23:54.880 --> 24:02.040
product of uppercase r times r1 and uppercase r times r2 is equal to the inner product of

24:02.040 --> 24:04.480
r1 with r2.

24:04.480 --> 24:09.320
For this equation to hold for any choice of position vectors, we need for the transpose

24:09.320 --> 24:16.360
of the rotation matrix times itself to be equal to the identity matrix.

24:16.360 --> 24:21.240
When we have this condition, we say that the matrix is orthogonal.

24:21.240 --> 24:26.760
So we see that a matrix must be orthogonal if it represents a rotation.

24:27.520 --> 24:34.320
Now we call the group of all rotation matrices SO3.

24:34.320 --> 24:41.480
Here, the three just refers to the fact that the matrices are all three-dimensional.

24:41.480 --> 24:47.960
The O stands for orthogonal and the S stands for special, which means that all the matrices

24:47.960 --> 24:50.520
have determinant 1.

24:50.520 --> 24:54.680
This is just because we don't want any matrices that would flip the orientation of our axes

24:54.920 --> 24:58.560
and have determinant minus 1, but let's not get into that.

24:58.560 --> 25:04.800
So from here on out, whenever I say SO3, remember that I'm talking about the group of all rotations

25:04.800 --> 25:09.960
of three-dimensional space.

25:09.960 --> 25:13.880
One of the nice things about group theory is that, because the definition of a group

25:13.880 --> 25:18.360
is so general, it applies in many different situations.

25:18.360 --> 25:22.280
Here is another completely different example of a group.

25:22.360 --> 25:26.440
First, begin by choosing any topological space.

25:26.440 --> 25:31.800
For example, here is the two-dimensional torus, which we call T2.

25:31.800 --> 25:35.240
Note that this torus is hollow and isn't filled in.

25:35.240 --> 25:42.120
Next, choose one arbitrary point on the torus, which we will call the base point.

25:42.120 --> 25:47.400
Consider a path on the torus that starts and ends at this base point.

25:47.400 --> 25:51.640
Remember that you can imagine the path like a little monorail track with the train going

25:51.640 --> 25:53.720
around in one direction.

25:53.720 --> 25:58.840
Importantly, the path is directed, so if the train were to go around in the other direction,

25:58.840 --> 26:02.680
we would consider that a distinct path.

26:02.680 --> 26:08.440
Furthermore, we'll consider any two paths to be the same if they can be continuously

26:08.440 --> 26:12.040
deformed into one another.

26:13.960 --> 26:20.760
Finally, we define pi1 of T2, which we call the fundamental group of the torus,

26:20.760 --> 26:25.880
to be the set of all paths which start and end at the base point.

26:25.880 --> 26:29.880
Now, even though we used the explicit example of the torus,

26:29.880 --> 26:36.280
every topological space has its own associated fundamental group.

26:36.280 --> 26:42.120
Now, you may be asking, wait, how can we add two paths together?

26:42.120 --> 26:46.520
To answer that, let's look at a different topological space.

26:46.520 --> 26:52.120
Here we have a two-dimensional disc with two holes cut out of it.

26:52.120 --> 26:55.800
Now let's choose an arbitrary base point, as well as two paths,

26:55.800 --> 27:01.880
p1 and p2. Here is our little train going around the first path, p1,

27:01.880 --> 27:05.960
and here it is going around the second path, p2.

27:05.960 --> 27:12.520
Now, to define the path p1 plus p2, we just have the train go around p1,

27:12.520 --> 27:16.200
and then go around p2.

27:16.200 --> 27:21.400
We can continuously deform this path to get a better look at it.

27:22.120 --> 27:25.880
All right, so what then is the inverse of a path?

27:25.880 --> 27:29.560
Well, if here we have a path p where the train goes around

27:29.560 --> 27:33.080
in one direction, then negative p is the path

27:33.080 --> 27:37.640
where the train goes around in the other direction.

27:39.240 --> 27:44.200
The path p plus negative p can always be deformed to the trivial path,

27:44.200 --> 27:47.880
which is the identity element of the group.

27:52.760 --> 27:57.720
So now that we know what the fundamental group is, let me ask you a question.

27:57.720 --> 28:03.560
What is the fundamental group of SO3?

28:03.800 --> 28:07.000
Here we have a bit of groupception, because I'm asking

28:07.000 --> 28:11.480
what is the fundamental group of a group?

28:12.200 --> 28:16.360
Well, here's SO3. Remember, this is just our old friend,

28:16.360 --> 28:22.280
the space of rotations. I've put the base point right in the center.

28:22.280 --> 28:26.600
Now, here is the only non-trivial path in SO3,

28:26.600 --> 28:32.440
corresponding to the 2-pi twist. If we add this path to itself, we get the

28:32.440 --> 28:37.480
4-pi twist, which can be contracted to the identity.

28:38.200 --> 28:45.240
Therefore, p plus p equals id. We could also rephrase this as p

28:45.240 --> 28:49.640
equals negative p, which is just because p can be continuously deformed

28:49.640 --> 28:52.600
into its inverse.

28:57.320 --> 29:03.720
Therefore, the fundamental group of SO3 only has two elements.

29:04.200 --> 29:09.960
Here is the full table for how you can add these two elements together.

29:11.240 --> 29:17.080
This is the full description for the fundamental group of SO3.

29:17.080 --> 29:21.240
Now, if we symbolically replace id with zero

29:21.240 --> 29:27.960
and p with one, then this table begins to look a little familiar.

29:28.760 --> 29:31.960
Specifically, we can see that the fundamental group

29:31.960 --> 29:41.080
of SO3 is just the integer's modulo 2, also known as z mod 2.

29:42.680 --> 29:47.800
Think about all of the beautiful mathematics summed up in this equation.

29:47.800 --> 29:53.000
The whole Dirac belt trick is just a demonstration of the fact that the

29:53.000 --> 29:59.240
fundamental group of the space of rotations is z mod 2.

29:59.480 --> 30:04.040
Now, if you'll indulge me for a moment, I'd like to talk about what makes

30:04.040 --> 30:08.840
mathematics so non-trivial. SO3 is a good example of the kind of

30:08.840 --> 30:12.360
object you see in math. You can think of it as a group,

30:12.360 --> 30:17.080
and you can think of it as a topological space.

30:17.080 --> 30:20.120
Therefore, we can study it using group theory,

30:20.120 --> 30:24.600
or we can study it using topology. Often in mathematics,

30:24.600 --> 30:27.480
you start by thinking about an object in one way,

30:27.480 --> 30:31.880
and then discover you can think about it in a completely different way.

30:31.880 --> 30:35.880
And, crucially, all the different ways to think about an object

30:35.880 --> 30:40.600
interact with each other. So, the group theory has implications for the

30:40.600 --> 30:46.360
topology, and the topology has implications for the group theory.

30:47.560 --> 30:51.160
Let's give a summary of part three.

30:51.160 --> 30:57.320
A group is a set with an operation that satisfies a handful of rules.

30:57.320 --> 31:01.720
The set of rotations forms a group. Rotations can be expressed using

31:01.720 --> 31:05.080
matrices, and the group of rotation matrices is

31:05.080 --> 31:09.720
denoted SO3. Every topological space has a group

31:09.720 --> 31:13.080
associated with it, called its fundamental group,

31:13.080 --> 31:18.120
which is the set of paths which start and end at a base point.

31:18.120 --> 31:23.240
The fundamental group of SO3 is z mod 2.

31:27.960 --> 31:38.200
It's finally time to discuss spin in quantum mechanics.

31:38.200 --> 31:43.400
You're probably used to thinking of vectors with an x, y, and z component.

31:43.400 --> 31:47.320
Normally, we'd say that vectors are elements of the set R3,

31:47.320 --> 31:50.680
because they're comprised of three real numbers.

31:50.680 --> 31:53.640
However, quantum spin vectors are a little different.

31:53.640 --> 31:56.760
They're instead comprised of two complex numbers,

31:56.840 --> 31:59.720
where here alpha and beta are the complex numbers,

31:59.720 --> 32:04.440
and thus we say that they are elements of the set C2.

32:04.440 --> 32:08.440
Remember that a complex number can be written as a plus bi,

32:08.440 --> 32:11.640
where a is the real part and b is the imaginary part.

32:11.640 --> 32:15.240
We can also write it as r times e to the i theta,

32:15.240 --> 32:18.760
using Euler's formula to express it in terms of a

32:18.760 --> 32:24.120
magnitude r and an angle theta. The other thing about complex numbers is

32:24.120 --> 32:26.520
that they can be quote-unquote conjugated.

32:26.520 --> 32:32.840
So, for instance, the conjugate of alpha would be a minus bi.

32:32.840 --> 32:35.960
Finally, the absolute value squared of a complex number

32:35.960 --> 32:38.440
is just the number times its conjugate,

32:38.440 --> 32:45.160
which is equal to a squared plus b squared, also known as r squared.

32:45.160 --> 32:49.560
Now, what do these complex numbers correspond to in the physical world?

32:49.560 --> 32:53.240
Well, say you had an electron whose spin vector had the components

32:53.240 --> 32:57.560
of alpha and beta. If you measure the direction of the

32:57.560 --> 33:01.720
electron's spin along the z-axis, then the probability that you find

33:01.720 --> 33:06.360
it to be spin up will be the absolute value of alpha squared.

33:06.360 --> 33:09.720
Meanwhile, the probability that you find it to be spin down

33:09.720 --> 33:13.640
will be the absolute value of beta squared.

33:13.640 --> 33:17.560
So, for instance, the state with components one and zero

33:17.560 --> 33:20.840
will be measured to be spin up 100 percent of the time,

33:20.920 --> 33:24.760
while the state with components zero and one will be measured to be

33:24.760 --> 33:28.920
spin down 100 percent of the time.

33:31.720 --> 33:35.560
Notice that, because all probabilities must sum to one,

33:35.560 --> 33:39.640
the absolute value of alpha squared plus the absolute value of beta squared

33:39.640 --> 33:42.760
must be equal to one.

33:44.760 --> 33:49.480
Now, as we discussed previously, vectors in r3 have an inner product where you

33:49.480 --> 33:54.120
take the transpose of one vector and multiply it by the other.

33:54.120 --> 33:57.880
Quantum spin vectors, however, have an inner product where you take the

33:57.880 --> 34:03.960
conjugate transpose of one vector and then multiply it by the other.

34:05.000 --> 34:09.400
Just to be clear, in order to take the conjugate transpose of a spin vector,

34:09.400 --> 34:13.320
you just complex conjugate the components and turn the column vector

34:13.320 --> 34:16.360
into a row vector.

34:17.160 --> 34:21.080
Now, you can use this inner product in order to extract the components of these

34:21.080 --> 34:24.920
spin vectors. For instance, the inner product of one

34:24.920 --> 34:31.240
zero with alpha beta is just alpha. Likewise, the inner product of zero

34:31.240 --> 34:36.040
one with alpha beta is just beta.

34:37.640 --> 34:40.760
Therefore, the probability to measure an electron to be

34:40.760 --> 34:44.840
spin up with respect to the z-axis is the absolute value squared

34:44.840 --> 34:49.080
of the inner product of the spin up state with alpha beta.

34:49.080 --> 34:53.800
Likewise, the probability to be spin down with respect to the z-axis

34:53.800 --> 34:57.240
is the absolute value squared of the inner product of the spin

34:57.240 --> 35:00.760
down state with alpha beta.

35:03.800 --> 35:07.400
Now, there's nothing fundamentally special about the z-axis.

35:07.400 --> 35:11.880
Here, I'll write the spin up and down states with respect to the x-axis

35:11.880 --> 35:18.280
and y-axis as well. So, the probability of a state to be, say,

35:18.280 --> 35:22.600
measured spin down along the y-axis will be the absolute value squared

35:22.600 --> 35:27.400
of the inner product of the spin down y-state with alpha beta.

35:27.400 --> 35:31.720
And likewise, you would have the same thing for being, say, spin up along the x-axis

35:31.720 --> 35:34.520
or what have you.

35:37.240 --> 35:40.200
So, whereas the inner product of position vectors

35:40.200 --> 35:44.360
is used to find lengths and angles, the inner product of our complex two

35:44.360 --> 35:50.600
dimensional spin vectors is used to find the probabilities of measurements.

35:51.960 --> 35:55.160
Now, we can also use the inner product to re-express

35:55.160 --> 35:59.160
another equation that we've seen. Remember that the condition that

35:59.160 --> 36:03.320
probabilities must sum to one implies that the absolute value of alpha

36:03.320 --> 36:07.400
squared plus the absolute value of beta squared must be equal to one.

36:07.400 --> 36:11.240
This is equivalent to saying that the inner product of a spin vector

36:11.240 --> 36:15.880
with itself must be equal to one. When we have this condition,

36:15.880 --> 36:19.880
we say that our spin vector is properly normalized or that we have a

36:19.880 --> 36:22.680
physical state.

36:26.040 --> 36:29.960
Now, let's talk about rotations. As we discussed earlier,

36:29.960 --> 36:34.040
rotations act on vectors as three by three matrices.

36:34.040 --> 36:38.360
In order to rotate a spin vector, however, we'll instead have to use a two

36:38.360 --> 36:42.920
by two matrix with complex entries. We'll label this matrix with the

36:42.920 --> 36:46.920
letter u. Remember that our rotation matrix

36:46.920 --> 36:50.440
needed to satisfy the condition that the transpose of the matrix

36:50.440 --> 36:53.960
times the matrix itself must be equal to the identity.

36:53.960 --> 36:59.320
What is the analogous condition that this new matrix u must satisfy?

37:00.200 --> 37:06.520
First off, rotating a spin vector shouldn't change the inner product of it

37:06.520 --> 37:09.640
with itself. Because if that starts off as one, then it

37:09.640 --> 37:15.080
should remain one after being rotated. In order for this to hold, we must have

37:15.080 --> 37:19.240
that the conjugate transpose of u times u

37:19.240 --> 37:23.720
is equal to the identity matrix. When we have this condition,

37:23.720 --> 37:28.520
we say that u is a unitary matrix.

37:31.400 --> 37:35.560
Now, aside from being unitary, there's one other slightly technical condition

37:35.560 --> 37:40.280
that we need to put on u. First, note that the spin vectors with the

37:40.280 --> 37:44.280
components of alpha, beta, and e to the i theta alpha,

37:44.280 --> 37:48.600
e to the i theta beta, have no observable differences.

37:48.600 --> 37:52.200
So, for example, when calculating the probability

37:52.200 --> 37:55.800
that the second state is spin up along the z-axis,

37:55.800 --> 37:59.080
the e to the i theta makes no difference in the final answer,

37:59.080 --> 38:03.880
because you're just taking the absolute value squared of that inner product.

38:03.880 --> 38:06.920
Physicists tend to call this factor of e to the i theta

38:06.920 --> 38:12.280
a phase. Anyway, this implies that the matrix u

38:12.280 --> 38:18.760
and e to the i theta times u correspond to the exact same transformation.

38:18.760 --> 38:22.120
Therefore, to get rid of this redundancy, we can choose

38:22.120 --> 38:26.280
for the determinant of u to be equal to one.

38:26.280 --> 38:29.720
Finally, we denote the set of all such matrices u

38:29.720 --> 38:35.960
that satisfy these conditions as su2. The two refers to the fact that the

38:35.960 --> 38:39.560
matrices are two-dimensional, the u refers to the fact that they're

38:39.560 --> 38:43.880
unitary, and the s stands for special, which means that the matrices have

38:43.880 --> 38:46.440
determinant one.

38:50.040 --> 38:56.680
So, to summarize part four, quantum spin states are vectors in c2.

38:56.680 --> 39:00.360
The inner product of spin vectors involves taking the conjugate transpose

39:00.360 --> 39:04.360
of one vector and multiplying it by the second one.

39:04.360 --> 39:07.720
There are states which are always spin up or spin down

39:07.720 --> 39:11.160
when measured with respect to certain directions in space.

39:11.160 --> 39:14.600
The probability that a state will be spin up in some direction

39:14.600 --> 39:18.520
will be the absolute value squared of its inner product with the spin up

39:18.520 --> 39:21.800
vector. In order to rotate a spin state, you

39:21.800 --> 39:27.080
must act on it by a matrix u in su2.

39:27.320 --> 39:41.960
Earlier, we got acquainted with s03 as a topological space.

39:41.960 --> 39:45.400
So, what about su2?

39:47.160 --> 39:50.280
Well, first let's write the 2 by 2 matrix u

39:50.280 --> 39:54.440
and call its four entries a, b, c, and d.

39:54.440 --> 39:57.800
Now, remember that u conjugate transpose times u

39:57.800 --> 40:02.680
must be equal to the identity matrix. This is equivalent to saying that u

40:02.680 --> 40:07.320
conjugate transpose must be equal to u inverse.

40:07.320 --> 40:11.560
If we write out this equation explicitly

40:11.560 --> 40:17.080
and use the fact that the determinant of u is equal to one,

40:17.080 --> 40:20.680
then after staring at this verbit, we realize that d

40:20.680 --> 40:24.840
must be equal to the conjugate of a, and c must be equal to

40:24.840 --> 40:29.080
minus the conjugate of b. Plugging these equations back in,

40:29.080 --> 40:32.680
we see that u must have the entries of a, b,

40:32.680 --> 40:38.040
negative b conjugate, and a conjugate. Now, notice that the determinant of this

40:38.040 --> 40:41.160
matrix is equal to the absolute value of a squared

40:41.160 --> 40:45.240
plus the absolute value of b squared. If we write

40:45.240 --> 40:51.000
a equals x plus i, y, and b equals z plus i, w,

40:51.000 --> 40:54.280
then the condition that this matrix has determinant one

40:54.280 --> 40:58.600
becomes x squared plus y squared plus z squared plus w squared

40:58.600 --> 41:03.160
equals one. So, this is all just to say that a completely

41:03.160 --> 41:07.240
general su2 matrix can be given by four real numbers

41:07.240 --> 41:11.880
x, y, z, and w such that x squared plus y squared plus z squared plus w

41:11.880 --> 41:16.440
squared equals one. This is the equation for something called

41:16.440 --> 41:21.320
the three sphere, which we denote s3.

41:27.320 --> 41:32.120
How do we picture this three sphere? Well, you might be familiar with the two

41:32.120 --> 41:35.480
sphere, which is given by the equation x squared plus y

41:35.480 --> 41:40.760
squared plus z squared equals one. The two sphere, which is hollow much

41:40.760 --> 41:44.360
like a beach ball, can be embedded in three-dimensional space,

41:44.360 --> 41:48.920
which allows us to easily visualize it. The three sphere,

41:48.920 --> 41:52.600
on the other hand, is embedded in four-dimensional space,

41:52.600 --> 41:56.120
which makes it much harder to picture. However,

41:56.120 --> 42:00.280
there is something we can do. Let's look again at the two sphere.

42:00.280 --> 42:03.960
You can divide it into two halves along the equator.

42:03.960 --> 42:08.040
You can then cut the sphere, flatten out the two pieces,

42:08.040 --> 42:12.440
and get two discs. These discs can be thought of as

42:12.440 --> 42:15.880
the set of points with x squared plus y squared

42:15.880 --> 42:20.200
less than or equal to one in the 2D plane.

42:20.200 --> 42:25.000
Anyway, let's refer to these discs as sheets.

42:27.400 --> 42:32.440
Here's a side-by-side view of the sphere and its two sheets.

42:32.440 --> 42:35.560
We can see what it looks like for a point to move around on the sphere

42:35.560 --> 42:38.920
from the perspective of the sheets.

42:41.480 --> 42:44.600
Notice that when the point hits the boundary of one sheet,

42:44.600 --> 42:47.880
it emerges on the other sheet.

42:52.760 --> 42:56.360
Therefore, we can see that the two sphere is equivalent to

42:56.360 --> 43:01.080
two different discs glued along their boundary.

43:01.240 --> 43:08.600
Now we can return to the three sphere. By direct analogy, the three sphere can be

43:08.600 --> 43:12.360
pictured as two solid balls which are glued together along

43:12.360 --> 43:16.520
their boundary. If a point hits the boundary of one

43:16.520 --> 43:20.360
ball, it will emerge on the other.

43:21.000 --> 43:25.720
Once again, we will refer to each ball as a sheet.

43:25.720 --> 43:30.360
So how is this three sphere related to SO3?

43:30.360 --> 43:33.640
Well, to discuss that, I'll need to introduce the concept

43:33.640 --> 43:40.200
of a covering space. Here I have an example of a covering space

43:40.200 --> 43:46.200
and a base space. In this example, the base space is just a circle and the

43:46.200 --> 43:52.920
covering space is also a circle, but it's been sort of doubled over on itself.

43:52.920 --> 43:56.760
Every point in the covering space can be projected down

43:56.760 --> 44:01.640
to a point in the base space. In this example, the projection map is a

44:01.640 --> 44:04.760
two-to-one function.

44:05.960 --> 44:09.640
But instead, what if we want to take a point in the base space

44:09.640 --> 44:13.880
and lift it to a point in the covering space?

44:13.880 --> 44:18.840
Well, now there are two possible choices for a point we could lift it to.

44:18.840 --> 44:25.080
Let's just choose the bottom point. Now let's see what happens if we move the

44:25.080 --> 44:28.520
point in the base space around in a loop and then bring it back to its

44:28.520 --> 44:31.400
original position.

44:35.000 --> 44:39.640
Interesting, so even though we initially decided to lift to the bottom

44:39.640 --> 44:43.000
choice, when we moved around in a loop, we were

44:43.000 --> 44:46.840
forced to end up with the top choice.

44:47.560 --> 44:52.200
Therefore, when we try to lift paths from the base space to the

44:52.200 --> 44:56.360
covering space, sometimes the start point and the end point of the path

44:56.360 --> 44:59.960
won't be the same in the covering space, even though they were the same in the

44:59.960 --> 45:02.520
base space.

45:03.320 --> 45:07.000
Now we are finally able to describe the relationship

45:07.000 --> 45:14.920
between SU2 and SO3. SU2 is the covering space of SO3.

45:14.920 --> 45:18.360
Just as in our example, this is a two-to-one covering,

45:18.360 --> 45:22.360
which we call a double cover.

45:23.080 --> 45:26.840
Just to get acquainted, let's see what happens when we move around a point

45:26.840 --> 45:29.640
in the base space.

45:30.360 --> 45:47.400
Now let's see what happens when we try to lift the path

45:47.400 --> 45:51.320
corresponding to the two-pi twist.

45:53.320 --> 45:57.960
Notice that in the covering space SU2, the start point of the path is

45:57.960 --> 46:01.560
different from the end point of the path.

46:10.200 --> 46:13.560
Interestingly, you could use this fact to rigorously prove

46:13.560 --> 46:17.960
that the two-pi twist is non-contractable in SO3.

46:17.960 --> 46:23.640
The proof follows by contradiction. If you could contract the path in SO3 to

46:23.640 --> 46:27.480
the trivial path, then you could also continuously lift the

46:27.480 --> 46:32.280
quote-unquote movie of the contraction to the covering space.

46:32.280 --> 46:36.200
This would then get you a contraction of the lifted path as well.

46:36.200 --> 46:39.640
However, because the start point in the covering space

46:39.640 --> 46:42.600
is different from the end point in the covering space,

46:42.600 --> 46:45.480
and because the start point and end point will always stay

46:45.480 --> 46:49.720
anchored in their positions during this movie, then clearly we can't contract the

46:49.720 --> 46:53.720
path in the covering space. Therefore, the path in the base space

46:53.720 --> 46:59.640
must be non-contractable as well, which is exactly what we wanted to prove.

47:02.280 --> 47:06.920
Actually, this proof is just one aspect of a more general phenomenon

47:06.920 --> 47:09.800
where non-contractable paths in a base space

47:09.800 --> 47:15.640
lift to paths which start and end at different points in a covering space.

47:16.200 --> 47:23.000
To finish up this part of the video, let me just show you how the

47:23.000 --> 47:31.560
four-pi twist can be contracted just for kicks.

47:32.440 --> 47:45.960
Let's now give a summary of part five.

47:45.960 --> 47:53.400
SU2 is equal to S3 as a topological space. You can picture S3 as two balls

47:53.400 --> 47:59.000
glued along their boundaries, which you could also think of as the equator.

47:59.080 --> 48:05.640
SU2 is a double cover of SO3. If you lift the path corresponding to the

48:05.640 --> 48:10.440
two-pi twist in SO3 to SU2, then the start point

48:10.440 --> 48:13.720
and the end point of the path will not be the same.

48:13.720 --> 48:17.160
This fact can be used to prove that the two-pi twist

48:17.160 --> 48:28.840
is non-contractable in SO3.

48:29.800 --> 48:37.480
At the start of this video, I said that rotating an electron 360 degrees

48:37.480 --> 48:41.640
puts it in a negated version of its original state.

48:41.640 --> 48:44.680
Let's now synthesize all the math we've learned

48:44.680 --> 48:49.720
in order to understand how this statement actually makes sense.

48:49.720 --> 48:54.520
The group which acts on C2 spin vectors is SU2.

48:54.520 --> 48:58.600
Therefore, to rotate an electron, we must lift a path

48:58.600 --> 49:05.640
from SO3 to SU2. SU2 is a double cover of SO3,

49:05.640 --> 49:09.720
and the two-pi twist ends up at a different element of SU2

49:09.720 --> 49:15.960
than it started. More specifically, if we start the lifted path at the identity

49:15.960 --> 49:18.760
matrix,

49:18.760 --> 49:26.440
then it'll end up at negative the identity matrix.

49:26.440 --> 49:29.800
However, the four-pi twist does end where it starts

49:29.800 --> 49:32.440
in SU2.

49:38.440 --> 49:41.720
Therefore, rotating an electron by two-pi

49:41.720 --> 49:45.880
negates its spin vector while rotating it by four-pi

49:45.960 --> 49:52.440
returns it to its original state. So that completes the explanation.

49:52.440 --> 49:56.760
Just to write down some explicit equations, let me explain how to find the

49:56.760 --> 50:01.560
SO3 rotation matrix corresponding to a matrix in SU2.

50:01.560 --> 50:05.720
Start by taking a position vector, r equals xyz,

50:05.720 --> 50:09.080
and convert it into the following two-by-two matrix,

50:09.080 --> 50:13.880
r dot the polymatrices, which is just x times the first polymatrix

50:13.880 --> 50:18.760
plus y times the second polymatrix plus z times the third polymatrix.

50:18.760 --> 50:21.720
This is actually the most general form for a traceless

50:21.720 --> 50:25.720
self-adjoint two-by-two matrix. Furthermore, the determinant of this

50:25.720 --> 50:29.480
matrix is equal to x squared plus y squared plus z squared,

50:29.480 --> 50:34.520
which is just the length squared of r. If we multiply this matrix by u on the

50:34.520 --> 50:37.960
left and the conjugate transpose of u on the right,

50:37.960 --> 50:42.040
the overall matrix will still be traceless and self-adjoint.

50:42.040 --> 50:45.480
Furthermore, its determinant will be unchanged.

50:45.480 --> 50:49.560
Therefore, we can write this new matrix as a new position vector,

50:49.560 --> 50:53.640
which we call r prime, dotted with the polymatrices.

50:53.640 --> 50:56.680
Because r and r prime must have the same length,

50:56.680 --> 51:01.320
r prime must just be a rotated version of r.

51:01.320 --> 51:06.600
So the rotation matrix, uppercase r, is just whatever three-by-three matrix

51:06.600 --> 51:10.520
satisfies the equation r prime equals uppercase r

51:10.520 --> 51:15.240
times r. This is how you convert an SU2 matrix u

51:15.240 --> 51:22.440
into an SO3 matrix r. Now notice that u and negative u

51:22.440 --> 51:26.440
map to the exact same rotation.

51:27.160 --> 51:30.680
This is how we can see that SU2 really is a double cover

51:30.680 --> 51:33.400
of SO3.

51:34.200 --> 51:37.720
Finally, I should just mention that there's this really useful explicit

51:37.720 --> 51:42.520
formula for the SU2 matrix u corresponding to a rotation

51:42.520 --> 51:45.720
given an axis n hat and an angle of rotation

51:45.720 --> 51:51.160
theta. Namely, u equals cosine of theta over 2

51:51.160 --> 51:55.080
times the identity matrix plus sine of theta over 2

51:55.080 --> 52:00.040
times negative i n hat dot the polymatrices.

52:00.040 --> 52:05.000
Notice that if we plug in theta equals 2 pi, then u equals negative the identity

52:05.000 --> 52:08.600
matrix, meaning a 2 pi rotation does negate the spin

52:08.600 --> 52:12.840
vector of an electron. We can also write this using matrix

52:12.840 --> 52:15.640
exponentiation, but let's not get into that.

52:15.640 --> 52:19.640
Oof, glad I got that out of my chest.

52:29.560 --> 52:33.560
Now, there are a few things you're probably wondering about.

52:33.560 --> 52:37.640
First off, how do you actually rotate an electron?

52:37.640 --> 52:42.440
Clearly, you can't just pick it up and rotate it like it's a tennis ball.

52:42.440 --> 52:46.520
There are two ways to answer this question. The first is that

52:46.520 --> 52:50.040
you can think of a rotation as the result of changing

52:50.040 --> 52:55.480
reference frames. For example, say you have your electron,

52:55.480 --> 53:00.200
put it on a table, and put that table in a room.

53:00.200 --> 53:05.720
If you then walk around the electron and continuously describe its quantum spin

53:05.720 --> 53:16.120
state using your own reference frame,

53:17.240 --> 53:20.360
then when you've finished walking 2 pi radians around it,

53:20.360 --> 53:24.760
the state of the electron will be negative. Now,

53:24.760 --> 53:28.600
that's all fine and good, but there's also a more concrete way to rotate an

53:28.600 --> 53:32.440
electron. You see, an electron's spin will create

53:32.440 --> 53:36.280
an angular momentum vector which points in some direction.

53:36.280 --> 53:40.600
If you then expose this electron to an external magnetic field,

53:40.600 --> 53:44.680
it'll cause the angular momentum vector to rotate around the magnetic field

53:44.680 --> 53:48.840
vector in a process known as Larmor procession.

53:48.840 --> 53:53.160
Therefore, you can use magnetic fields to rotate electrons.

53:53.160 --> 53:56.680
Here's something else you might be wondering. Is there any way we could

53:56.760 --> 54:02.200
experimentally detect the minus sign which comes from a 2 pi rotation?

54:02.200 --> 54:09.160
Amazingly, the answer is yes. Here's how. First, take your electron and then

54:09.160 --> 54:14.120
put it in a quantum superposition at two different locations.

54:14.120 --> 54:19.160
Then, subject one of them to a magnetic field, rotating it by 2 pi radians,

54:19.160 --> 54:25.080
inducing the minus sign. Finally, recombine the electrons.

54:25.080 --> 54:30.200
In the end, you'll find interference effects stemming from the minus sign.

54:30.200 --> 54:33.640
This exact thing has actually already been done with neutrons.

54:33.640 --> 54:37.960
Look up neutron interferometry for more details.

54:37.960 --> 54:43.480
So, way back when I said that an overall phase has no observable consequences,

54:43.480 --> 54:47.800
I was being a bit imprecise. You can detect overall phases in quantum

54:47.800 --> 54:50.840
mechanics, but only if you make superpositions and

54:50.840 --> 54:55.320
create interference experiments. Here's something else I wanted to tell

54:55.320 --> 54:59.800
you about. Real projective space. If you take the

54:59.800 --> 55:03.560
two sphere and identify antipodal points as the same

55:03.560 --> 55:06.840
point, you create a topological space known as

55:06.840 --> 55:12.600
RP2 or two-dimensional real projective space.

55:13.160 --> 55:17.880
To reiterate, every pair of antipodal points on the two sphere

55:17.880 --> 55:24.280
is just one point in RP2. We can write this in the language of

55:24.280 --> 55:29.640
equivalence relations by saying that RP2 is s2 modulo the

55:29.640 --> 55:34.200
equivalence relation that the point x, y, z is the same as

55:34.200 --> 55:40.440
negative x, negative y, negative z. Now, this construction directly extends

55:40.440 --> 55:45.880
to the three sphere. So, RP3 is just s3 modulo the equivalence

55:45.880 --> 55:49.480
relation that antipodal points on the three sphere

55:49.480 --> 55:55.160
are identified with each other. The relevance this has for us is that

55:55.160 --> 56:01.160
topologically, s03 is RP3. This goes hand in hand with

56:01.160 --> 56:05.480
s2 being s3 and gives us another way to understand

56:05.480 --> 56:10.440
how s02 is the double cover of s03.

56:10.760 --> 56:16.040
On the subject of this covering space business, let me point out that while

56:16.040 --> 56:21.400
the fundamental group of s03 is z mod2, the fundamental group of s02

56:21.400 --> 56:24.760
is the trivial group, the group with only one element, which is because all

56:24.760 --> 56:28.120
paths can be contracted on the three sphere.

56:28.120 --> 56:32.840
Note that the fundamental group of s03 then has twice the number of elements

56:32.840 --> 56:37.480
as the fundamental group of s02. This fact is intimately related to the

56:37.480 --> 56:43.720
fact that s02 is a double cover of s03 and not, say, a triple cover.

56:43.720 --> 56:46.920
If this stuff intrigues you, you should probably go learn some algebraic

56:46.920 --> 56:49.560
topology.

56:50.360 --> 56:55.080
One other thing I wanted to mention is the hop vibration.

56:55.080 --> 56:58.280
Okay, I've mentioned it.

57:08.120 --> 57:33.720
The ancient philosophers, Euclid, Plato, etc, knew that the essence of the

57:33.720 --> 57:38.120
universe was based on mathematics.

57:38.120 --> 57:43.080
But they didn't know which mathematical objects it was based on.

57:43.080 --> 57:46.920
Rather than, say, platonic solids or triangles,

57:46.920 --> 57:50.280
the real building blocks of the universe are things like groups,

57:50.280 --> 57:54.280
vector spaces, you know, stuff like that.

57:56.920 --> 58:01.720
So it appears that nature is far more subtle and creative than we humans,

58:01.800 --> 58:05.960
because not only did she make these bizarre spin-one-half objects,

58:05.960 --> 58:09.480
she made a whole universe out of them.

58:10.840 --> 58:15.640
But strangely, even nature isn't free to do whatever she wants.

58:15.640 --> 58:22.360
She is constrained and constrained very severely by the laws of mathematics.

58:22.360 --> 58:28.600
That non-contractable path in s03 is simply there no matter what.

58:28.600 --> 58:32.520
So while nature could devise a spin-one-half particle,

58:32.520 --> 58:35.960
she could never devise, say, a spin-one-third particle,

58:35.960 --> 58:39.640
because the fundamental group of s03 is z mod 2

58:39.640 --> 58:44.200
and not z mod 3. So while nature is creative,

58:44.200 --> 58:47.800
that creativity can only exist within some very rigid

58:47.800 --> 58:53.000
and maybe even tautological bounds. So when we study physics and mathematics

58:53.000 --> 58:56.680
today, we still do, in the end, get that same

58:56.680 --> 59:02.360
ancient platonic feeling, albeit with a spooky modern twist.

59:02.360 --> 59:04.360
Thanks for watching.
