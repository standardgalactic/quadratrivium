1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,280
To perform the Dirac belt trick, you'll need two things, one a belt and two a large book.

2
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:24,800
The book is to keep one end of the belt in place while the other moves around.

3
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:34,280
To begin, take the free end of the belt and turn it by 360 degrees.

4
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,280
You will now see a twist in the belt.

5
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,100
The goal is to find a way to take out this twist.

6
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,320
What makes this interesting is that you're not allowed to rotate either end of the belt,

7
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,800
so you can't just directly undo the twist.

8
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:54,000
However, you are allowed to move both ends around in space, as long as you don't turn

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,760
them while doing so.

10
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,200
Now you have to try this for yourself to be convinced, but no matter what you do, you

11
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,200
won't be able to undo the twist in the belt.

12
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,440
So that was a big failure.

13
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:12,720
However, in the beginning, instead of twisting the belt by 360 degrees, what if we instead

14
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,880
twisted it by 720 degrees, which is two full rotations?

15
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,600
Can we undo the twist now?

16
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,760
Well, watch this.

17
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,200
Amazing.

18
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:38,080
We can't undo a 360-degree twist, but we can undo a 720-degree twist.

19
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,360
That's the Dirac Belt Trick.

20
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,840
Paul Dirac, one of the greatest physicists of all time, invented this trick in order

21
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,000
to help explain to his students the bizarre nature of quantum spin one-half particles,

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
such as electrons and protons.

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,960
An older version of this trick was popularized in the book Riddles of the Sphinx and Other

24
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,400
Mathematical Puzzletales by Martin Gardner.

25
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:05,400
For this older trick, the first step is to put your belt back on.

26
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:10,080
Then get a pair of scissors and two pieces of string about 10 feet long.

27
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,280
Thread the strings through the holes in the scissors and tie off the ends in two loops.

28
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,720
Now step on the two loops of string and hold the scissors right in front of you straight

29
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,080
up.

30
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:26,200
Then rotate the scissors around by 720 degrees.

31
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,680
Once again, you can take out the twist and the strings by moving the pair of scissors

32
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,760
without rotating them.

33
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,960
But this is sort of dumb, so let's just stick with the belt.

34
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,680
Anyway, what does any of this have to do with quantum mechanics?

35
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:46,440
Well, if you take a normal object, like this soup can, and rotate it 360 degrees, it'll

36
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:51,440
end up exactly how it started.

37
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,960
But now let's say you have an electron.

38
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:58,040
We'll paint a little plus sign on it so we can see how it's oriented.

39
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:03,800
Let's see what happens when we rotate this electron by 360 degrees.

40
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,260
What?

41
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,800
What happened to the plus sign?

42
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,800
All I see is a stupid minus sign.

43
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:14,000
Well, let's keep rotating it and see if that helps.

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,960
Ah, look, it's the plus sign again.

45
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:23,400
So we can see that when we rotate an electron by 360 degrees, it doesn't return to its

46
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,120
original state, but rather a negated version of its original state.

47
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:34,760
However, when we rotate it by 720 degrees, then we get back the original state.

48
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:40,160
This is the property of the electron, that the Dirac Belt Trick attempts to explain.

49
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:46,960
Now at this point, you may be saying, wait, a 360 degree rotation is a 360 degree rotation.

50
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,080
You can't say it's only a half.

51
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,680
Well, in order to explain this trick more precisely, I'm going to have to introduce

52
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,320
some concepts from the branches of mathematics known as group theory and topology, which

53
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,280
will take some time.

54
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,040
Having said that, I think it's well worth the effort, because the story of the Dirac

55
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:10,080
Belt Trick is, in my opinion, one of the most wonderful and fundamental in all of physics.

56
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:24,320
Imagine you wanted to rotate this snowman.

57
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,600
You would have to specify two things.

58
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:33,440
One, an axis of rotation, and two, an angle of rotation.

59
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:40,680
Now, we could rotate any object we want, and admittedly this snowman is a little silly.

60
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,600
So let's instead use these coordinate axes.

61
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:52,640
We can once again choose an axis, and an angle to rotate it by.

62
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,960
Throughout this video, whenever I rotate these coordinate axes, I'll always include the

63
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,640
ghostly image of its original orientation.

64
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:05,600
Now from here on out, let's always measure angles using radians instead of degrees.

65
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:12,400
So for instance, pi over two radians is 90 degrees, pi radians is 180 degrees, 2 pi radians

66
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,760
is 360 degrees, and 4 pi radians is 720 degrees.

67
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:23,520
Anyway, to recap, you can specify a rotation with two pieces of information.

68
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,600
One, an axis, and two, an angle.

69
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,200
We'll define the rotation to always go in the counterclockwise direction around the

70
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:37,200
axis in accordance with the standard right hand rule, which says that if you point your

71
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:41,800
thumb in the direction of the axis, then you rotate in the same direction that your fingers

72
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,560
are curling.

73
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:48,720
Now let's package these two pieces of information together in a different way.

74
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,800
Instead of using an axis and an angle, let's use a single vector, which points in the direction

75
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:01,200
of the axis, but has the length of the angle theta measured in radians.

76
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:08,720
So using this, how can we understand what the space of all rotations is?

77
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:15,400
Abstractly, the space of rotations is a set, and individual points contained in the set

78
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,880
each correspond to one rotation.

79
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,200
Concretely, we can picture the space of rotations as follows.

80
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:29,400
Here we have a three-dimensional ball with a radius of pi.

81
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,420
Now consider a point contained in this ball.

82
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:37,560
This point corresponds to a rotation, namely the one given by the vector, which has its

83
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,780
base at the center of the ball and its tip on the point itself.

84
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:47,840
This vector will have a length ranging from 0 to pi because the ball itself has a radius

85
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,360
of pi.

86
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:55,640
Remember, the direction of this vector corresponds to the axis of rotation and its length corresponds

87
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,680
to the angle of rotation.

88
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,160
To let you soak this in, I'm going to show the vector in the space of rotations on the

89
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:07,120
right and the rotation it corresponds to on the left.

90
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:49,200
Now, there's actually something kind of funny about the space of rotations.

91
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:56,760
Notice that if you rotate around an axis by exactly pi radians in the clockwise direction,

92
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:02,760
the result is exactly the same as if you had rotated by pi radians in the counterclockwise

93
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:08,640
direction.

94
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:19,520
Therefore, this means that a point on the boundary of our ball corresponds to the exact

95
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:25,960
same rotation as the antipodal point on the other side of the boundary.

96
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:33,200
So, we can have a point in the space of rotations go out to the boundary and come back out the

97
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,760
other side.

98
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,920
While it looks like the point has jumped discontinuously, this is actually just an artifact of our

99
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,440
visualization.

100
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,760
So, it's actually not quite correct to say that the space of rotations is a ball of

101
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,440
radius pi.

102
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:55,160
We also have to include this extra stipulation, which says that antipodal points on the boundary

103
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:59,600
of this ball are equivalent to each other.

104
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,680
Let's now give a summary of part one.

105
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:09,080
It takes two pieces of information to specify a rotation, an axis and an angle.

106
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:14,240
Alternatively, we can use a vector, which points in the direction of the axis and has

107
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,560
the length of the angle.

108
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,560
We can visualize the space of rotations as a ball of radius pi, where each point in

109
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,800
the ball is one rotation.

110
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:30,680
We must identify antipodal points on the boundary of the ball because clockwise and counterclockwise

111
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:47,600
rotations around an axis by 180 degrees are really the same.

112
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,400
Now that we understand the space of rotations, let's think about pads through the space of

113
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,480
rotations.

114
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,920
Here is an example of a path.

115
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:05,000
It's sort of like a monorail with a point going around it in one direction.

116
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Here I've displayed the point going around the path alongside the rotation it corresponds

117
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:24,840
to.

118
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,720
Enter the belt.

119
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,320
If you think about it, a belt is a lot like a path because it has a start point and an

120
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,720
end point.

121
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,360
As we'll see, it turns out that a belt does indeed correspond to a path through the space

122
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,920
of rotations.

123
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,360
Here's how.

124
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,480
Choose a point along the belt.

125
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:50,480
Now have the x-axis point along the length of the belt, the y-axis point perpendicular

126
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:58,360
to the belt, and the z-axis point along the width of the belt.

127
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:03,560
Now as we move down the belt, our axes will change accordingly.

128
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:09,260
Because every orientation of these axes corresponds to a rotation, we can see that the belt really

129
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:14,040
does trace out a path in the space of rotations.

130
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,920
Let's look at some concrete examples.

131
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:38,960
Here is a path that rotates around the x-axis by an ever-increasing angle.

132
00:11:38,960 --> 00:12:01,120
Now let's do the same thing around the y-axis.

133
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:23,280
And here's a version around the z-axis.

134
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:31,720
Here's a more arbitrary shaped path.

135
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,840
This looks kind of messed up though.

136
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,480
Okay, this one is important.

137
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,720
This is the trivial path, the path that just stays right at the center of the ball.

138
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:47,640
Note that the belt corresponding to the trivial path is completely straight.

139
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:53,000
Okay, now let's talk about the belt trick again.

140
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Remember what I said the rules of the belt trick are?

141
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,280
What makes this interesting is that you're not allowed to rotate either end of the belt,

142
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,560
so you can't just directly undo the twist.

143
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:12,880
However, you are allowed to move both ends around in space, as long as you don't turn

144
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:18,880
them while doing so.

145
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,280
What does it mean that you can't rotate the ends of the belt?

146
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,360
Well let's look at this path.

147
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,280
Notice that it starts and ends at the middle.

148
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:42,800
That means that the axes start and end completely unrotated.

149
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:50,080
But let's look at what happens when we change the endpoint of the path.

150
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:55,440
Notice that if the path doesn't end at the same place it starts, then the final configuration

151
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,720
of the axes won't be unrotated.

152
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,800
Therefore, our stipulation that you can't rotate the end of the belt means that our

153
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:10,720
path in rotation space must end at the same place that it begins.

154
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,000
Now what was the goal of the belt trick?

155
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,880
The goal is to find a way to take out this twist.

156
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:22,000
Notice that a perfectly straight belt with no twist in it corresponds to the trivial

157
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,560
path.

158
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:31,120
That means that making the belt straight corresponds to contracting the entire path down to a point.

159
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,720
Now for the path we have here, that's very easy to do.

160
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,160
However, let's look at the belt with a 2-pi twist in it.

161
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:44,160
Remember, this was the path we weren't able to undo at the beginning.

162
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:50,840
And indeed, no matter how hard you try, you won't be able to contract this path.

163
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:57,680
Intuitively, this is because the two points on the boundary are actually the same point.

164
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:02,240
But if we wanted to contract this path, we'd somehow have to bring these two points next

165
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,480
to each other.

166
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,840
But we can't do that because they always have to remain antipodal.

167
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:16,080
Now what about the path with a 4-pi twist in it?

168
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,680
Let's separate out the two strands of this path a little, just so we can get a better

169
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,240
look at it.

170
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:25,920
Now remember, earlier I was able to get the twist out of this belt.

171
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:52,360
So let's see what that looks like here.

172
00:15:52,360 --> 00:16:02,760
I know that was a lot to take in, so let's look over this a bit slower.

173
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:06,800
Here is the path corresponding to a 4-pi twist.

174
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,880
Here I've labeled the two pairs of antipodal points.

175
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,880
For instance, the two points labeled A are really just two manifestations of the same

176
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:20,320
point.

177
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:30,040
Now let's watch how this path can be contracted.

178
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,360
Did you see that?

179
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,680
Let's look at it again.

180
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:39,720
Notice how the points A and B are approaching each other, which allows one part of the path

181
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:46,040
to be pulled through the boundary and come out the other side.

182
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,000
Pretty neat, right?

183
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,640
Here's another way to understand how this path can be contracted.

184
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:57,040
This time, I've kept the path straight instead of curved and colored the two different branches

185
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:05,920
slightly different shades of gray.

186
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:10,040
Let's see how these paths through the space of rotations act on our snowman at different

187
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:36,600
stages of the contraction.

188
00:17:36,600 --> 00:18:00,200
Notice that there are essentially two rotations going on, which I've labeled one and two.

189
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:06,160
The contraction works by making the axes go from being parallel to antiparallel and then

190
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:11,800
decreasing their respective angles of rotation.

191
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:15,480
So let's give a summary of part two.

192
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:21,280
Each configuration of the belt corresponds to a path through the space of rotations.

193
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:26,040
The trivial path corresponds to a perfectly straight belt.

194
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:30,560
Some paths can be contracted to a single point without having to move their start point or

195
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,760
their end point.

196
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:37,200
The Dirac Belt Trick is a demonstration of the fact that the path corresponding to a

197
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,800
two-pi twist can't be contracted to the trivial path, while the path corresponding to a four-pi

198
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:55,800
twist can.

199
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,440
Allow me to introduce some notation.

200
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:05,320
This expression should be read as g is an element of g, that is, the lowercase g is

201
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:11,000
one element of the set named uppercase g.

202
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,480
With that out of the way, let's talk about groups.

203
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:23,000
The word group in mathematics has a very specific meaning, namely a group is a set with an operation.

204
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,920
More specifically, there are four rules that this operation must satisfy.

205
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:37,240
The first rule is that if g1 and g2 are elements of the set g, then g1 plus g2 must also be

206
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,600
an element of the set g.

207
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,080
Here we're denoting our operation with the plus symbol.

208
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:51,840
We could have used a number of other symbols, but let's stick with this.

209
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:57,000
The second rule is that there must be some element of the group, which we call id, which

210
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:04,000
is short for identity, such that for any other element of the group g, g plus id is equal

211
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,320
to g.

212
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:12,840
The third rule is that if you add g1 and g2 together and then add it to g3, the result

213
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:19,960
will be the same as if you added g1 to the sum of g2 and g3.

214
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:25,520
The fourth rule is that for any element g, there must be some other element, which we'll

215
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:33,360
call negative g, such that g plus negative g is equal to the identity.

216
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:38,920
Here negative g is called the inverse of g.

217
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:47,760
These four rules are the exact rigorous definition for what mathematicians call a group.

218
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,480
Now this is all a bit abstract.

219
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,360
What's an example of a group?

220
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:56,680
Well one example is the set of rotations.

221
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:04,040
Take for instance the rotation around the x-axis by pi, and the rotation around the

222
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:08,080
y-axis by pi.

223
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,800
How do we add these together?

224
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:16,040
Well for rotations, plus just means that we do the first rotation first, and the second

225
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,920
rotation second.

226
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:25,040
So to add these together, first let's rotate around the x-axis by pi, and then let's rotate

227
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,880
around the y-axis by pi.

228
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:34,400
Now notice that this final rotation is exactly the same as if we had just rotated around

229
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:42,160
the z-axis by pi.

230
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:51,840
So hopefully you can see how you can add two rotations together and get a third one.

231
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,800
What about the identity element?

232
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,760
Which rotation corresponds to id?

233
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:06,320
Well that'll just be the trivial rotation, the rotation where you don't do anything.

234
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,800
What about inverses?

235
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,320
How do we invert a rotation?

236
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:17,680
Well if a rotation involves rotating around some axis in the counterclockwise direction,

237
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:23,280
then we can undo it just by rotating in the clockwise direction.

238
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:29,680
So we can see that every rotation does indeed have an inverse.

239
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:35,400
So that wraps up the explanation for how rotations form a mathematical group.

240
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,520
This is a good opportunity for me to talk about matrices.

241
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:44,320
Let's write the actual mathematical formula for the rotation around the x-axis by an angle

242
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,320
of theta.

243
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:51,640
We express the rotation as a transformation on a position vector.

244
00:22:51,640 --> 00:23:00,400
We can also write this as a 3x3 matrix acting on the original vector.

245
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,400
To explain what distinguishes rotation matrices from any old arbitrary matrix, we have to

246
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,080
discuss the inner product.

247
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,760
Say you have two three-dimensional vectors r1 and r2.

248
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:18,360
The inner product of r1 with r2, which can also be written as r1 transpose times r2,

249
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:25,160
is equal to the sum of the products of their components.

250
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:30,920
Geometrically, the inner product of two vectors is just the product of the lengths of the vectors

251
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:34,400
times the cosine of the angle between them.

252
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:40,160
Now notice that rotations preserve both lengths and relative angles.

253
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:48,840
This means that if you rotate both vectors together, their inner product won't change.

254
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:54,880
In other words, if we denote the rotation matrix with the letter uppercase r, then the inner

255
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:02,040
product of uppercase r times r1 and uppercase r times r2 is equal to the inner product of

256
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,480
r1 with r2.

257
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:09,320
For this equation to hold for any choice of position vectors, we need for the transpose

258
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:16,360
of the rotation matrix times itself to be equal to the identity matrix.

259
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:21,240
When we have this condition, we say that the matrix is orthogonal.

260
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:26,760
So we see that a matrix must be orthogonal if it represents a rotation.

261
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:34,320
Now we call the group of all rotation matrices SO3.

262
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:41,480
Here, the three just refers to the fact that the matrices are all three-dimensional.

263
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:47,960
The O stands for orthogonal and the S stands for special, which means that all the matrices

264
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,520
have determinant 1.

265
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:54,680
This is just because we don't want any matrices that would flip the orientation of our axes

266
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:58,560
and have determinant minus 1, but let's not get into that.

267
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:04,800
So from here on out, whenever I say SO3, remember that I'm talking about the group of all rotations

268
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:09,960
of three-dimensional space.

269
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,880
One of the nice things about group theory is that, because the definition of a group

270
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:18,360
is so general, it applies in many different situations.

271
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:22,280
Here is another completely different example of a group.

272
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:26,440
First, begin by choosing any topological space.

273
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:31,800
For example, here is the two-dimensional torus, which we call T2.

274
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,240
Note that this torus is hollow and isn't filled in.

275
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:42,120
Next, choose one arbitrary point on the torus, which we will call the base point.

276
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:47,400
Consider a path on the torus that starts and ends at this base point.

277
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:51,640
Remember that you can imagine the path like a little monorail track with the train going

278
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,720
around in one direction.

279
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:58,840
Importantly, the path is directed, so if the train were to go around in the other direction,

280
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:02,680
we would consider that a distinct path.

281
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:08,440
Furthermore, we'll consider any two paths to be the same if they can be continuously

282
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:12,040
deformed into one another.

283
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:20,760
Finally, we define pi1 of T2, which we call the fundamental group of the torus,

284
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:25,880
to be the set of all paths which start and end at the base point.

285
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,880
Now, even though we used the explicit example of the torus,

286
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:36,280
every topological space has its own associated fundamental group.

287
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:42,120
Now, you may be asking, wait, how can we add two paths together?

288
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:46,520
To answer that, let's look at a different topological space.

289
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:52,120
Here we have a two-dimensional disc with two holes cut out of it.

290
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:55,800
Now let's choose an arbitrary base point, as well as two paths,

291
00:26:55,800 --> 00:27:01,880
p1 and p2. Here is our little train going around the first path, p1,

292
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:05,960
and here it is going around the second path, p2.

293
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:12,520
Now, to define the path p1 plus p2, we just have the train go around p1,

294
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:16,200
and then go around p2.

295
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:21,400
We can continuously deform this path to get a better look at it.

296
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:25,880
All right, so what then is the inverse of a path?

297
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:29,560
Well, if here we have a path p where the train goes around

298
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:33,080
in one direction, then negative p is the path

299
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:37,640
where the train goes around in the other direction.

300
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:44,200
The path p plus negative p can always be deformed to the trivial path,

301
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,880
which is the identity element of the group.

302
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:57,720
So now that we know what the fundamental group is, let me ask you a question.

303
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:03,560
What is the fundamental group of SO3?

304
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:07,000
Here we have a bit of groupception, because I'm asking

305
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,480
what is the fundamental group of a group?

306
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:16,360
Well, here's SO3. Remember, this is just our old friend,

307
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:22,280
the space of rotations. I've put the base point right in the center.

308
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:26,600
Now, here is the only non-trivial path in SO3,

309
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:32,440
corresponding to the 2-pi twist. If we add this path to itself, we get the

310
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:37,480
4-pi twist, which can be contracted to the identity.

311
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:45,240
Therefore, p plus p equals id. We could also rephrase this as p

312
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:49,640
equals negative p, which is just because p can be continuously deformed

313
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,600
into its inverse.

314
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:03,720
Therefore, the fundamental group of SO3 only has two elements.

315
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:09,960
Here is the full table for how you can add these two elements together.

316
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:17,080
This is the full description for the fundamental group of SO3.

317
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:21,240
Now, if we symbolically replace id with zero

318
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:27,960
and p with one, then this table begins to look a little familiar.

319
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,960
Specifically, we can see that the fundamental group

320
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:41,080
of SO3 is just the integer's modulo 2, also known as z mod 2.

321
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:47,800
Think about all of the beautiful mathematics summed up in this equation.

322
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:53,000
The whole Dirac belt trick is just a demonstration of the fact that the

323
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:59,240
fundamental group of the space of rotations is z mod 2.

324
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:04,040
Now, if you'll indulge me for a moment, I'd like to talk about what makes

325
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:08,840
mathematics so non-trivial. SO3 is a good example of the kind of

326
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:12,360
object you see in math. You can think of it as a group,

327
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:17,080
and you can think of it as a topological space.

328
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:20,120
Therefore, we can study it using group theory,

329
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:24,600
or we can study it using topology. Often in mathematics,

330
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,480
you start by thinking about an object in one way,

331
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:31,880
and then discover you can think about it in a completely different way.

332
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:35,880
And, crucially, all the different ways to think about an object

333
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:40,600
interact with each other. So, the group theory has implications for the

334
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:46,360
topology, and the topology has implications for the group theory.

335
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:51,160
Let's give a summary of part three.

336
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:57,320
A group is a set with an operation that satisfies a handful of rules.

337
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:01,720
The set of rotations forms a group. Rotations can be expressed using

338
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:05,080
matrices, and the group of rotation matrices is

339
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:09,720
denoted SO3. Every topological space has a group

340
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:13,080
associated with it, called its fundamental group,

341
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:18,120
which is the set of paths which start and end at a base point.

342
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:23,240
The fundamental group of SO3 is z mod 2.

343
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:38,200
It's finally time to discuss spin in quantum mechanics.

344
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:43,400
You're probably used to thinking of vectors with an x, y, and z component.

345
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:47,320
Normally, we'd say that vectors are elements of the set R3,

346
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,680
because they're comprised of three real numbers.

347
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:53,640
However, quantum spin vectors are a little different.

348
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,760
They're instead comprised of two complex numbers,

349
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,720
where here alpha and beta are the complex numbers,

350
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:04,440
and thus we say that they are elements of the set C2.

351
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:08,440
Remember that a complex number can be written as a plus bi,

352
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,640
where a is the real part and b is the imaginary part.

353
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:15,240
We can also write it as r times e to the i theta,

354
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,760
using Euler's formula to express it in terms of a

355
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:24,120
magnitude r and an angle theta. The other thing about complex numbers is

356
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,520
that they can be quote-unquote conjugated.

357
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:32,840
So, for instance, the conjugate of alpha would be a minus bi.

358
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,960
Finally, the absolute value squared of a complex number

359
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,440
is just the number times its conjugate,

360
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:45,160
which is equal to a squared plus b squared, also known as r squared.

361
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:49,560
Now, what do these complex numbers correspond to in the physical world?

362
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:53,240
Well, say you had an electron whose spin vector had the components

363
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:57,560
of alpha and beta. If you measure the direction of the

364
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:01,720
electron's spin along the z-axis, then the probability that you find

365
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:06,360
it to be spin up will be the absolute value of alpha squared.

366
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,720
Meanwhile, the probability that you find it to be spin down

367
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:13,640
will be the absolute value of beta squared.

368
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:17,560
So, for instance, the state with components one and zero

369
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:20,840
will be measured to be spin up 100 percent of the time,

370
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:24,760
while the state with components zero and one will be measured to be

371
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:28,920
spin down 100 percent of the time.

372
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:35,560
Notice that, because all probabilities must sum to one,

373
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:39,640
the absolute value of alpha squared plus the absolute value of beta squared

374
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:42,760
must be equal to one.

375
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:49,480
Now, as we discussed previously, vectors in r3 have an inner product where you

376
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:54,120
take the transpose of one vector and multiply it by the other.

377
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:57,880
Quantum spin vectors, however, have an inner product where you take the

378
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:03,960
conjugate transpose of one vector and then multiply it by the other.

379
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,400
Just to be clear, in order to take the conjugate transpose of a spin vector,

380
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:13,320
you just complex conjugate the components and turn the column vector

381
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:16,360
into a row vector.

382
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:21,080
Now, you can use this inner product in order to extract the components of these

383
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:24,920
spin vectors. For instance, the inner product of one

384
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:31,240
zero with alpha beta is just alpha. Likewise, the inner product of zero

385
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:36,040
one with alpha beta is just beta.

386
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:40,760
Therefore, the probability to measure an electron to be

387
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:44,840
spin up with respect to the z-axis is the absolute value squared

388
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:49,080
of the inner product of the spin up state with alpha beta.

389
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:53,800
Likewise, the probability to be spin down with respect to the z-axis

390
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,240
is the absolute value squared of the inner product of the spin

391
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:00,760
down state with alpha beta.

392
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,400
Now, there's nothing fundamentally special about the z-axis.

393
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:11,880
Here, I'll write the spin up and down states with respect to the x-axis

394
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:18,280
and y-axis as well. So, the probability of a state to be, say,

395
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:22,600
measured spin down along the y-axis will be the absolute value squared

396
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:27,400
of the inner product of the spin down y-state with alpha beta.

397
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:31,720
And likewise, you would have the same thing for being, say, spin up along the x-axis

398
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,520
or what have you.

399
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:40,200
So, whereas the inner product of position vectors

400
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:44,360
is used to find lengths and angles, the inner product of our complex two

401
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:50,600
dimensional spin vectors is used to find the probabilities of measurements.

402
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,160
Now, we can also use the inner product to re-express

403
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:59,160
another equation that we've seen. Remember that the condition that

404
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:03,320
probabilities must sum to one implies that the absolute value of alpha

405
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:07,400
squared plus the absolute value of beta squared must be equal to one.

406
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:11,240
This is equivalent to saying that the inner product of a spin vector

407
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:15,880
with itself must be equal to one. When we have this condition,

408
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:19,880
we say that our spin vector is properly normalized or that we have a

409
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,680
physical state.

410
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:29,960
Now, let's talk about rotations. As we discussed earlier,

411
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:34,040
rotations act on vectors as three by three matrices.

412
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:38,360
In order to rotate a spin vector, however, we'll instead have to use a two

413
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:42,920
by two matrix with complex entries. We'll label this matrix with the

414
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:46,920
letter u. Remember that our rotation matrix

415
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:50,440
needed to satisfy the condition that the transpose of the matrix

416
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:53,960
times the matrix itself must be equal to the identity.

417
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:59,320
What is the analogous condition that this new matrix u must satisfy?

418
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:06,520
First off, rotating a spin vector shouldn't change the inner product of it

419
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,640
with itself. Because if that starts off as one, then it

420
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:15,080
should remain one after being rotated. In order for this to hold, we must have

421
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:19,240
that the conjugate transpose of u times u

422
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:23,720
is equal to the identity matrix. When we have this condition,

423
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:28,520
we say that u is a unitary matrix.

424
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:35,560
Now, aside from being unitary, there's one other slightly technical condition

425
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:40,280
that we need to put on u. First, note that the spin vectors with the

426
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:44,280
components of alpha, beta, and e to the i theta alpha,

427
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:48,600
e to the i theta beta, have no observable differences.

428
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:52,200
So, for example, when calculating the probability

429
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,800
that the second state is spin up along the z-axis,

430
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:59,080
the e to the i theta makes no difference in the final answer,

431
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:03,880
because you're just taking the absolute value squared of that inner product.

432
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,920
Physicists tend to call this factor of e to the i theta

433
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:12,280
a phase. Anyway, this implies that the matrix u

434
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:18,760
and e to the i theta times u correspond to the exact same transformation.

435
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:22,120
Therefore, to get rid of this redundancy, we can choose

436
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:26,280
for the determinant of u to be equal to one.

437
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:29,720
Finally, we denote the set of all such matrices u

438
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:35,960
that satisfy these conditions as su2. The two refers to the fact that the

439
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:39,560
matrices are two-dimensional, the u refers to the fact that they're

440
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:43,880
unitary, and the s stands for special, which means that the matrices have

441
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,440
determinant one.

442
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:56,680
So, to summarize part four, quantum spin states are vectors in c2.

443
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:00,360
The inner product of spin vectors involves taking the conjugate transpose

444
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:04,360
of one vector and multiplying it by the second one.

445
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:07,720
There are states which are always spin up or spin down

446
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:11,160
when measured with respect to certain directions in space.

447
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:14,600
The probability that a state will be spin up in some direction

448
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:18,520
will be the absolute value squared of its inner product with the spin up

449
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,800
vector. In order to rotate a spin state, you

450
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:27,080
must act on it by a matrix u in su2.

451
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:41,960
Earlier, we got acquainted with s03 as a topological space.

452
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,400
So, what about su2?

453
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:50,280
Well, first let's write the 2 by 2 matrix u

454
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:54,440
and call its four entries a, b, c, and d.

455
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:57,800
Now, remember that u conjugate transpose times u

456
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:02,680
must be equal to the identity matrix. This is equivalent to saying that u

457
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:07,320
conjugate transpose must be equal to u inverse.

458
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:11,560
If we write out this equation explicitly

459
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:17,080
and use the fact that the determinant of u is equal to one,

460
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:20,680
then after staring at this verbit, we realize that d

461
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:24,840
must be equal to the conjugate of a, and c must be equal to

462
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:29,080
minus the conjugate of b. Plugging these equations back in,

463
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:32,680
we see that u must have the entries of a, b,

464
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:38,040
negative b conjugate, and a conjugate. Now, notice that the determinant of this

465
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:41,160
matrix is equal to the absolute value of a squared

466
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:45,240
plus the absolute value of b squared. If we write

467
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:51,000
a equals x plus i, y, and b equals z plus i, w,

468
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,280
then the condition that this matrix has determinant one

469
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:58,600
becomes x squared plus y squared plus z squared plus w squared

470
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:03,160
equals one. So, this is all just to say that a completely

471
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:07,240
general su2 matrix can be given by four real numbers

472
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:11,880
x, y, z, and w such that x squared plus y squared plus z squared plus w

473
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:16,440
squared equals one. This is the equation for something called

474
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:21,320
the three sphere, which we denote s3.

475
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:32,120
How do we picture this three sphere? Well, you might be familiar with the two

476
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:35,480
sphere, which is given by the equation x squared plus y

477
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:40,760
squared plus z squared equals one. The two sphere, which is hollow much

478
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:44,360
like a beach ball, can be embedded in three-dimensional space,

479
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:48,920
which allows us to easily visualize it. The three sphere,

480
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:52,600
on the other hand, is embedded in four-dimensional space,

481
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:56,120
which makes it much harder to picture. However,

482
00:41:56,120 --> 00:42:00,280
there is something we can do. Let's look again at the two sphere.

483
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:03,960
You can divide it into two halves along the equator.

484
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:08,040
You can then cut the sphere, flatten out the two pieces,

485
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:12,440
and get two discs. These discs can be thought of as

486
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:15,880
the set of points with x squared plus y squared

487
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:20,200
less than or equal to one in the 2D plane.

488
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:25,000
Anyway, let's refer to these discs as sheets.

489
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:32,440
Here's a side-by-side view of the sphere and its two sheets.

490
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:35,560
We can see what it looks like for a point to move around on the sphere

491
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:38,920
from the perspective of the sheets.

492
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:44,600
Notice that when the point hits the boundary of one sheet,

493
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,880
it emerges on the other sheet.

494
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:56,360
Therefore, we can see that the two sphere is equivalent to

495
00:42:56,360 --> 00:43:01,080
two different discs glued along their boundary.

496
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:08,600
Now we can return to the three sphere. By direct analogy, the three sphere can be

497
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:12,360
pictured as two solid balls which are glued together along

498
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:16,520
their boundary. If a point hits the boundary of one

499
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:20,360
ball, it will emerge on the other.

500
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,720
Once again, we will refer to each ball as a sheet.

501
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:30,360
So how is this three sphere related to SO3?

502
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:33,640
Well, to discuss that, I'll need to introduce the concept

503
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:40,200
of a covering space. Here I have an example of a covering space

504
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:46,200
and a base space. In this example, the base space is just a circle and the

505
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:52,920
covering space is also a circle, but it's been sort of doubled over on itself.

506
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:56,760
Every point in the covering space can be projected down

507
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:01,640
to a point in the base space. In this example, the projection map is a

508
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:04,760
two-to-one function.

509
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:09,640
But instead, what if we want to take a point in the base space

510
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:13,880
and lift it to a point in the covering space?

511
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:18,840
Well, now there are two possible choices for a point we could lift it to.

512
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:25,080
Let's just choose the bottom point. Now let's see what happens if we move the

513
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:28,520
point in the base space around in a loop and then bring it back to its

514
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:31,400
original position.

515
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,640
Interesting, so even though we initially decided to lift to the bottom

516
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:43,000
choice, when we moved around in a loop, we were

517
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,840
forced to end up with the top choice.

518
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:52,200
Therefore, when we try to lift paths from the base space to the

519
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:56,360
covering space, sometimes the start point and the end point of the path

520
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:59,960
won't be the same in the covering space, even though they were the same in the

521
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:02,520
base space.

522
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:07,000
Now we are finally able to describe the relationship

523
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:14,920
between SU2 and SO3. SU2 is the covering space of SO3.

524
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:18,360
Just as in our example, this is a two-to-one covering,

525
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:22,360
which we call a double cover.

526
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:26,840
Just to get acquainted, let's see what happens when we move around a point

527
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:29,640
in the base space.

528
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:47,400
Now let's see what happens when we try to lift the path

529
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:51,320
corresponding to the two-pi twist.

530
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:57,960
Notice that in the covering space SU2, the start point of the path is

531
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:01,560
different from the end point of the path.

532
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:13,560
Interestingly, you could use this fact to rigorously prove

533
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:17,960
that the two-pi twist is non-contractable in SO3.

534
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:23,640
The proof follows by contradiction. If you could contract the path in SO3 to

535
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:27,480
the trivial path, then you could also continuously lift the

536
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:32,280
quote-unquote movie of the contraction to the covering space.

537
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:36,200
This would then get you a contraction of the lifted path as well.

538
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:39,640
However, because the start point in the covering space

539
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:42,600
is different from the end point in the covering space,

540
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:45,480
and because the start point and end point will always stay

541
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:49,720
anchored in their positions during this movie, then clearly we can't contract the

542
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:53,720
path in the covering space. Therefore, the path in the base space

543
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:59,640
must be non-contractable as well, which is exactly what we wanted to prove.

544
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:06,920
Actually, this proof is just one aspect of a more general phenomenon

545
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,800
where non-contractable paths in a base space

546
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:15,640
lift to paths which start and end at different points in a covering space.

547
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:23,000
To finish up this part of the video, let me just show you how the

548
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:31,560
four-pi twist can be contracted just for kicks.

549
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:45,960
Let's now give a summary of part five.

550
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:53,400
SU2 is equal to S3 as a topological space. You can picture S3 as two balls

551
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:59,000
glued along their boundaries, which you could also think of as the equator.

552
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:05,640
SU2 is a double cover of SO3. If you lift the path corresponding to the

553
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:10,440
two-pi twist in SO3 to SU2, then the start point

554
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:13,720
and the end point of the path will not be the same.

555
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:17,160
This fact can be used to prove that the two-pi twist

556
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:28,840
is non-contractable in SO3.

557
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:37,480
At the start of this video, I said that rotating an electron 360 degrees

558
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:41,640
puts it in a negated version of its original state.

559
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:44,680
Let's now synthesize all the math we've learned

560
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:49,720
in order to understand how this statement actually makes sense.

561
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:54,520
The group which acts on C2 spin vectors is SU2.

562
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:58,600
Therefore, to rotate an electron, we must lift a path

563
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:05,640
from SO3 to SU2. SU2 is a double cover of SO3,

564
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:09,720
and the two-pi twist ends up at a different element of SU2

565
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:15,960
than it started. More specifically, if we start the lifted path at the identity

566
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:18,760
matrix,

567
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:26,440
then it'll end up at negative the identity matrix.

568
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:29,800
However, the four-pi twist does end where it starts

569
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,440
in SU2.

570
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:41,720
Therefore, rotating an electron by two-pi

571
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:45,880
negates its spin vector while rotating it by four-pi

572
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:52,440
returns it to its original state. So that completes the explanation.

573
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:56,760
Just to write down some explicit equations, let me explain how to find the

574
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:01,560
SO3 rotation matrix corresponding to a matrix in SU2.

575
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:05,720
Start by taking a position vector, r equals xyz,

576
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:09,080
and convert it into the following two-by-two matrix,

577
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:13,880
r dot the polymatrices, which is just x times the first polymatrix

578
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:18,760
plus y times the second polymatrix plus z times the third polymatrix.

579
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:21,720
This is actually the most general form for a traceless

580
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:25,720
self-adjoint two-by-two matrix. Furthermore, the determinant of this

581
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:29,480
matrix is equal to x squared plus y squared plus z squared,

582
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:34,520
which is just the length squared of r. If we multiply this matrix by u on the

583
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:37,960
left and the conjugate transpose of u on the right,

584
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:42,040
the overall matrix will still be traceless and self-adjoint.

585
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:45,480
Furthermore, its determinant will be unchanged.

586
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:49,560
Therefore, we can write this new matrix as a new position vector,

587
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:53,640
which we call r prime, dotted with the polymatrices.

588
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:56,680
Because r and r prime must have the same length,

589
00:50:56,680 --> 00:51:01,320
r prime must just be a rotated version of r.

590
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:06,600
So the rotation matrix, uppercase r, is just whatever three-by-three matrix

591
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:10,520
satisfies the equation r prime equals uppercase r

592
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:15,240
times r. This is how you convert an SU2 matrix u

593
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:22,440
into an SO3 matrix r. Now notice that u and negative u

594
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:26,440
map to the exact same rotation.

595
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:30,680
This is how we can see that SU2 really is a double cover

596
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:33,400
of SO3.

597
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:37,720
Finally, I should just mention that there's this really useful explicit

598
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:42,520
formula for the SU2 matrix u corresponding to a rotation

599
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:45,720
given an axis n hat and an angle of rotation

600
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:51,160
theta. Namely, u equals cosine of theta over 2

601
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:55,080
times the identity matrix plus sine of theta over 2

602
00:51:55,080 --> 00:52:00,040
times negative i n hat dot the polymatrices.

603
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:05,000
Notice that if we plug in theta equals 2 pi, then u equals negative the identity

604
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,600
matrix, meaning a 2 pi rotation does negate the spin

605
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:12,840
vector of an electron. We can also write this using matrix

606
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:15,640
exponentiation, but let's not get into that.

607
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:19,640
Oof, glad I got that out of my chest.

608
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:33,560
Now, there are a few things you're probably wondering about.

609
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:37,640
First off, how do you actually rotate an electron?

610
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:42,440
Clearly, you can't just pick it up and rotate it like it's a tennis ball.

611
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:46,520
There are two ways to answer this question. The first is that

612
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:50,040
you can think of a rotation as the result of changing

613
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:55,480
reference frames. For example, say you have your electron,

614
00:52:55,480 --> 00:53:00,200
put it on a table, and put that table in a room.

615
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:05,720
If you then walk around the electron and continuously describe its quantum spin

616
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:16,120
state using your own reference frame,

617
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:20,360
then when you've finished walking 2 pi radians around it,

618
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:24,760
the state of the electron will be negative. Now,

619
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:28,600
that's all fine and good, but there's also a more concrete way to rotate an

620
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:32,440
electron. You see, an electron's spin will create

621
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:36,280
an angular momentum vector which points in some direction.

622
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:40,600
If you then expose this electron to an external magnetic field,

623
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:44,680
it'll cause the angular momentum vector to rotate around the magnetic field

624
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:48,840
vector in a process known as Larmor procession.

625
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:53,160
Therefore, you can use magnetic fields to rotate electrons.

626
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:56,680
Here's something else you might be wondering. Is there any way we could

627
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:02,200
experimentally detect the minus sign which comes from a 2 pi rotation?

628
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:09,160
Amazingly, the answer is yes. Here's how. First, take your electron and then

629
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:14,120
put it in a quantum superposition at two different locations.

630
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:19,160
Then, subject one of them to a magnetic field, rotating it by 2 pi radians,

631
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:25,080
inducing the minus sign. Finally, recombine the electrons.

632
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:30,200
In the end, you'll find interference effects stemming from the minus sign.

633
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:33,640
This exact thing has actually already been done with neutrons.

634
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:37,960
Look up neutron interferometry for more details.

635
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:43,480
So, way back when I said that an overall phase has no observable consequences,

636
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:47,800
I was being a bit imprecise. You can detect overall phases in quantum

637
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:50,840
mechanics, but only if you make superpositions and

638
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:55,320
create interference experiments. Here's something else I wanted to tell

639
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:59,800
you about. Real projective space. If you take the

640
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:03,560
two sphere and identify antipodal points as the same

641
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:06,840
point, you create a topological space known as

642
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:12,600
RP2 or two-dimensional real projective space.

643
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:17,880
To reiterate, every pair of antipodal points on the two sphere

644
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:24,280
is just one point in RP2. We can write this in the language of

645
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:29,640
equivalence relations by saying that RP2 is s2 modulo the

646
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:34,200
equivalence relation that the point x, y, z is the same as

647
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:40,440
negative x, negative y, negative z. Now, this construction directly extends

648
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:45,880
to the three sphere. So, RP3 is just s3 modulo the equivalence

649
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:49,480
relation that antipodal points on the three sphere

650
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:55,160
are identified with each other. The relevance this has for us is that

651
00:55:55,160 --> 00:56:01,160
topologically, s03 is RP3. This goes hand in hand with

652
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:05,480
s2 being s3 and gives us another way to understand

653
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:10,440
how s02 is the double cover of s03.

654
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:16,040
On the subject of this covering space business, let me point out that while

655
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:21,400
the fundamental group of s03 is z mod2, the fundamental group of s02

656
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:24,760
is the trivial group, the group with only one element, which is because all

657
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:28,120
paths can be contracted on the three sphere.

658
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:32,840
Note that the fundamental group of s03 then has twice the number of elements

659
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:37,480
as the fundamental group of s02. This fact is intimately related to the

660
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:43,720
fact that s02 is a double cover of s03 and not, say, a triple cover.

661
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:46,920
If this stuff intrigues you, you should probably go learn some algebraic

662
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:49,560
topology.

663
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:55,080
One other thing I wanted to mention is the hop vibration.

664
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:58,280
Okay, I've mentioned it.

665
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:33,720
The ancient philosophers, Euclid, Plato, etc, knew that the essence of the

666
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:38,120
universe was based on mathematics.

667
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:43,080
But they didn't know which mathematical objects it was based on.

668
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:46,920
Rather than, say, platonic solids or triangles,

669
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:50,280
the real building blocks of the universe are things like groups,

670
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:54,280
vector spaces, you know, stuff like that.

671
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:01,720
So it appears that nature is far more subtle and creative than we humans,

672
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:05,960
because not only did she make these bizarre spin-one-half objects,

673
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:09,480
she made a whole universe out of them.

674
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:15,640
But strangely, even nature isn't free to do whatever she wants.

675
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:22,360
She is constrained and constrained very severely by the laws of mathematics.

676
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:28,600
That non-contractable path in s03 is simply there no matter what.

677
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:32,520
So while nature could devise a spin-one-half particle,

678
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:35,960
she could never devise, say, a spin-one-third particle,

679
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:39,640
because the fundamental group of s03 is z mod 2

680
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:44,200
and not z mod 3. So while nature is creative,

681
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:47,800
that creativity can only exist within some very rigid

682
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:53,000
and maybe even tautological bounds. So when we study physics and mathematics

683
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:56,680
today, we still do, in the end, get that same

684
00:58:56,680 --> 00:59:02,360
ancient platonic feeling, albeit with a spooky modern twist.

685
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:04,360
Thanks for watching.
