1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,920
my name is John Rovicki perfect okay John so would you tell us a little bit

2
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,760
about what you do for a living what is your life's work the main thing I guess

3
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:38,160
is I have sort of two things I'm doing one is I'm a bona fide academic I'm an

4
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,640
associate professor at the University of Toronto in cognitive psychology and

5
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,080
cognitive science so I study the nature of cognition how we learn solve

6
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:52,200
problems I also study related phenomena like wisdom meaning in life

7
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,400
consciousness mindfulness altered states of consciousness mystical

8
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,040
experiences and so that's something I've been studying as a long time as an

9
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:05,080
academic I'm also a longtime practitioner I been practicing meditation

10
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:10,840
contemplation Tai Chi Chuan for like 30 years so that's one thing I'm doing and

11
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:18,160
then starting I guess about was it 2019 I started an online presence I did a

12
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:22,680
video series called awakening from the meaning crisis in which I was

13
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,600
addressing the issue that most people are finding increasingly finding it

14
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:31,840
increasingly difficult to find meaning in life and to get a framework in which

15
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,520
they can cultivate wisdom or perhaps even an appreciation of the sacred within

16
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:41,160
a scientific worldview and then I've been doing a lot of series around that and

17
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:45,120
trying to get those two things those two aspects of my life thankfully are

18
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,880
mutually supportive and to try and get them even better coordinated to try and

19
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,680
address the meaning crisis that I mentioned great what is it about your

20
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:59,600
personality or even the events that have happened in your past life that got

21
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:05,120
you interested in all these different things well that's a really good question

22
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:12,720
and so for me the the pivotal moment or at least the pivotal episode perhaps it's

23
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,880
a better way of putting it I was brought up in a fundamentalist Christian

24
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:22,140
family and of course I love my family this is extended family and so I'm not

25
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:29,200
trying to criticize them as people but I found I guess given my personality my

26
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,120
own line of psychosocial development that I found that experience ultimately

27
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:39,480
traumatizing it really had a sort of profound negative impact on me but it

28
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:45,120
is very sort of bivalent for me because your first religion well we have this

29
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,320
term your mother tongue the first language you you you learn is with you

30
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:53,280
always and it informs everything else well you can you sort of have like a

31
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,800
mother religion too and so it left the taste in my mouth if I can put it that

32
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,160
way for transcendence and for seeking deeper connection and meaning in a sense

33
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:08,200
for the sacred dimension to reality but at the same time I was traumatized by

34
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:13,760
the existing religion and then I was I basically set out on this path to try

35
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,760
and resolve that sort of meaning crisis I was experiencing myself and when I was

36
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,240
in university I encountered the figure of Socrates in the cultivation of wisdom

37
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:27,840
and this opened up an avenue for me and so from there I started going down the

38
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:34,600
road but the academic study of wisdom it drops off the table after like first

39
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:39,480
year university even within philosophy which is ironic given that the love of

40
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:44,680
wisdom is literally what philosophy means now I went on to studies philosophy

41
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,600
because I valued the sort of meta science and medical to critique and the

42
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:53,560
tools it was giving but that hunger for wisdom and transcendence was missing and

43
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,080
so I started I went to a place and I started learning Tai Chi Chuan and

44
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,560
meditation and contemplation and then that started to really satisfy that

45
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:12,640
hunger for wisdom and transcendence but for me as I was doing this right the

46
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,440
cognitive science world was starting to move more and more towards these topics

47
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,840
and when I started to talk about these topics within my academic courses at

48
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:27,040
the university I was noticing that they were really catching with the students

49
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,640
these were the things they were like getting really fascinated in I think it

50
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,440
was the first person at the University of Toronto to start talking about my

51
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:37,080
mindfulness within a scientific perspective and then they started asking

52
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:42,120
me to teach the courses on meditation contemplation extracurricular and I did

53
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:48,360
that for a long time and so I noticed this confluence and I noticed that many

54
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,920
of my students were resonating with that confluence and so I started to do more

55
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:57,640
and more about building that bridge the bridge between science and spirituality

56
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,640
to address the meeting crisis

57
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:03,040
I really resonate with that on a personal level I always thought that that's what

58
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:08,640
college was supposed to be like and you expand you have these transcended experiences

59
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,640
but not that for me.

60
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:20,200
And your case is not by any means unique many of the students after sorry this

61
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:24,120
isn't meant to be self-promotional but many students after they're taking the

62
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,560
classes with me they will say something like that this is what I wanted

63
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,800
University to be and I don't know why the other courses aren't like that so

64
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:37,400
yeah very much there's a there's a need that's not being met right now now to be

65
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,560
fair there's a lot of other people like me doing this kind of work and one of the

66
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:46,160
advantages gifts of doing my series was I've got I've been able to meet them and

67
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,160
started interacting with them.

68
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:54,160
You had mentioned meditation and contemplation. Now meditation is something that many people are

69
00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:00,160
familiar with whether they do it correctly or not but contemplation is a

70
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,160
word that you don't hear too often and I was wondering if you could explain a little bit about that.

71
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,160
This goes right towards my academic work but it also is something that I use

72
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,760
when I'm trying to train I talk about two languages we you have to coordinate

73
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:16,260
there's a language of explaining which you'd use in science and then there's a

74
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:19,160
language of training which you're using when people are trying to cultivate

75
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,560
things so let me let's not talk initially about meditation and contemplation

76
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:28,360
let's talk about their common root in attention and so what I want you to notice

77
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:33,360
is that your attention is we have a sort of a like a spotlight model of

78
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,260
attention that what we do is shine our attention and on something that makes it

79
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:42,200
stand out and that's right in so far as attention changes how things stand out

80
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,800
for you how salient they are but there's a lot more going on so for one thing one

81
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,160
of the things you can do with your attention is you can focus on me as a

82
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,880
whole gestalt or you can zoom in to a feature and you go back and forth and

83
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:00,440
that's dynamic you're constantly doing it because of what Marlo Ponte called an

84
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,560
optimal grip like you're constantly like it when you're looking at my hand

85
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,560
depends what your what your goal is whether or not you focus like let's say

86
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,920
if you wanted to see if I was married you might look at the ring finger but if

87
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,840
you want to see if I worked with my hands a lot you might go more gestalt

88
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,560
like you're gonna move in and out until you get the balance between detail and

89
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,720
the whole and you're constantly doing that with your attention gestalt and

90
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:26,240
feature so you're constantly doing that but there's another thing you can do

91
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:32,720
and let me use an analogy for that it's one that's become a somewhat of a mean

92
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,400
for my work but it's still good maybe that's why it became a mean and so I

93
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:43,760
use this when I'm teaching also my students meditation and I want you to

94
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:48,540
notice something think about my glasses my glasses are literally framing my

95
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:52,780
experience there's right and I'm looking through them in both senses of the

96
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:58,020
word I'm looking past them and by means of them now so right now my glasses are

97
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:03,540
actually transparent to me but I can do this sometimes I have to step back and

98
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:08,460
look at my glasses rather than looking right through them so now my glasses are

99
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:12,380
opaque and why would I do that because I might want to clear some gunk off on my

100
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:20,660
glasses right you're always mentally framing so your mind you're not at most

101
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:24,340
the time looking at your mind you're looking through your mind at the world

102
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:29,500
and you're framing it in terms of what you're focusing in on as salient what

103
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:33,620
you're focusing in on as relevant what your backgrounding and foregrounding do

104
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,580
you see how dynamic it is like soon as you and it's been it's constantly

105
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:40,700
shifting it's like this I call it a shifting salience landscape so you're

106
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:47,700
constantly doing that now just like your glasses are transparent to you and you

107
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:52,340
might not notice how they're distorting your vision your mental framing can be

108
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:56,020
transparent to you and you're not noticed and what you do in meditation is you

109
00:08:56,020 --> 00:09:00,940
first learn to step back and look at your mental framing rather than looking

110
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:05,420
through it this is really what's meant by centering your attention it doesn't

111
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:09,540
mean just focusing it's you're stepping back and looking at and you also are

112
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:14,900
trying to break up the Gestalt patterns into the feature details right so

113
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:18,420
you're stepping back and looking at the mind right and then instead of just

114
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,900
gestalting you're also going in and trying to break up the features notice

115
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:26,300
the patterns and processes that are going on because you're trying to see how

116
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:30,660
that might be distorting now think about this that's a valuable thing to do in

117
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,740
meditation but what would you need to do in order to see if you've actually

118
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:39,500
cleaned your glasses what would you need to do wow no because what I would

119
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:48,300
think you'd do first is put them on and see if you see differently right that's

120
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:52,700
what contemplation is contemplation is going the other way it's trying to look

121
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:59,620
more deeply into reality and to grab the the big picture the Gestalt and to see

122
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:04,860
if you can seem better than you could before that's contemplation the word

123
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:09,100
contemplation you can hear the word temple in contemplation temple means to

124
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:15,260
to look out to look up to the sky the Latin contemplatio is a translation of

125
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:19,140
the Greek word theoria which means to look deeply it's where we get our word

126
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:23,260
theory from to look deeply into things and so what you have to do is you

127
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:26,620
actually have to cycle between these you have to step back and see if it's

128
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:31,020
distorting you make changes and see if that makes a difference in how you see

129
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:35,020
the world and if you see the world and you start to see how more how it really

130
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:39,620
is that guides you in saying oh I bet this is distorting my vision and then

131
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:44,060
you see what you do you cycle back and forth between meditation and

132
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:48,180
contemplation one of my criticisms of how the West is appropriating or

133
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:53,500
misappropriating mindfulness traditions is they tend to only concentrate on one

134
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:59,100
of these typically meditation if you look at the ecology of practices what in

135
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,940
cultures where the mindful these mindfulness practices are more

136
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:06,700
indigenous what you find is people have a whole set of practices they have

137
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:11,620
meditative practices contemplative practices moving practices and

138
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:15,580
interpersonal social practices because you need to be cultivating them all

139
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:20,740
together because they act like checks and balances on each other

140
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:26,740
that's great I want to step back a bit and talk about the state of the world

141
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:32,220
right now so we can for sure cover why this is important so we all know we're

142
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:36,780
living in an interesting time it seems cordial but it's stressful it can be

143
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:40,900
stressful people are on edge there's a lot going on you can see that with

144
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:49,860
suicide rates last couple of years and I was wondering

145
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:58,180
a leading question why you think the reason for that is so in science you

146
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:01,700
you find things that seem disconnected and you do what's called an inference

147
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,820
to the best explanation you try and come up with the best explanation for all of

148
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:09,180
these disconnected things that unites them together that's how you afford

149
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:13,940
understanding so I have a proposal in that sense I think it's a theory that's

150
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:19,580
born out by evidence that a lot of these that you can see a lot of what I call

151
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:24,300
symptoms almost like the way a doctor looks at various things and through

152
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:28,380
them sees an underlying disease I call them symptoms of the meeting crisis this

153
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:34,380
goes to work I did with Christopher Mastipriaccio Philip Misovic and the

154
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:45,500
idea is that you can see a lot of markers of distress as negative symptoms

155
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,940
you can also see a lot of markers of positive response and you can give a

156
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:53,020
unified explanation of this in terms of how people are responding to the

157
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:57,660
meeting crisis either in a malfunction a way or in a functional way so as you

158
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:03,460
already mentioned you know suicide especially among the younger generations

159
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:07,980
and going out child suicide is now becoming an issue which is a that's a

160
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:12,460
profound marker that something's going wrong interestingly Tatiana

161
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:18,820
shell has Chanel has got provided good evidence that there's a direct line

162
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:22,180
between a sense of loss of meaning and suicide that doesn't have to pass through

163
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:26,540
clinical depression so we used to think people are clinically depressed and they

164
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:30,780
sort of sense meaninglessness or meaninglessness try triggers clinical

165
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:35,020
depression and that leads to suicide but it looks like no people can go directly

166
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:40,420
from the sense of meaninglessness into suicide there was a survey in Great

167
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:45,060
Britain I think it was 2017 something like 89% of the adult survey thought

168
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:50,740
their lives were meaningless and there's overwhelming evidence that that is

169
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:55,020
predictive of a lot of things going wrong the survey also showed another

170
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:59,260
symptom of the meaning crisis a loneliness epidemic right as you

171
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:04,820
mentioned a mental health epidemic we're getting you know rise mark you know rise

172
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:10,660
we're getting an increase in the markers for depression measurements of

173
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:15,980
depression anxiety disorders related we're getting various addiction crises

174
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:22,060
the opioid crisis so these are all markers of this meaning crisis you get

175
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:29,180
the the rise it's funny I was actually interviewed by rebel wisdom just at the

176
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:35,060
beginning of COVID and I was predicting a rise in what Jules Evans calls he

177
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:39,420
resurrected the term conspirituality which is a mixture of conspiracy theories

178
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:45,420
and spirituality practices like QAnon and things like that and you see that as

179
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:52,740
another marker but you also see some positive responses you see the rise

180
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:03,740
of and we've talked about it already although I have some criticisms of it

181
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:08,460
but you see the rise of the mindfulness movement as an attempt to respond to that

182
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:14,660
you see the rise of Hellenistic philosophies like stoicism is going

183
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:20,140
through this huge revival that you see the attempts to import Buddhism and

184
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:27,500
stoicism Buddhism and Taoism into the West in order and you see the emergence

185
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:32,460
and I get to be involved with these people of new communities Rafe Kelly's

186
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:36,540
evolved move play where people are integrated he does where he takes

187
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:41,700
people out into the woods and they do parkour right and then they do mindfulness

188
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:45,660
and they do martial arts and then they do campfire discourse where people are

189
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:50,540
doing all of this to try and enhance meaning in life so this whole like that

190
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:54,540
would look sort of chaotic and disparate but if you pause it that all of this can

191
00:15:54,580 --> 00:16:00,740
be seen as a response to a profound sense of loss of meaning or meaning being

192
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:04,820
under threat meaning in life then you can explain all of those in terms of this

193
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:11,140
idea of the meaning crisis and so I would suggest that the reason why a lot of

194
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:16,940
people are under stress right now and pursuing various strategies to try and

195
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:20,620
intensify meaning is exactly that meaning crisis

196
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:31,220
well I did 25 hours of lecture on the awakening for the meaning crisis to try

197
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:36,420
and give an answer to that question so I will do my best to try and collapse that

198
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:43,260
into a couple of minutes of a response there's two basic dimensions to

199
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:47,340
answering a question that are really important one is a structural dimension

200
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:51,460
what is meaning what are we talking about and why does it come under threat

201
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:56,140
why is it at risk and then the second is a historical so let me talk about the

202
00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:00,420
first because I need the first to explain the second so here's the basic idea

203
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:06,100
and this is this this for me is this is where I'm placing all my epistemic and

204
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:12,020
career bets because for me this is this is the lich pin which is the centrality

205
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:21,100
of meaning so it goes like this you are a cognitive agent you can move in many

206
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:25,540
domains and solve many problems within many domains you're really really

207
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:28,820
interesting and I don't mean to make you sound like a specimen but I find that

208
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:34,660
so fascinating about human beings that they have this capacity and what's what

209
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:38,100
that what seems to be I would argue and what I published on at the core of this

210
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:43,900
is this really unique ability we have and which and why it strikes me is so

211
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:47,700
unique it's the thing we're trying to give artificial intelligence and we

212
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:50,980
haven't figured out how to do it and we're this is this is the although we're

213
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:55,220
making progress so I want you to notice that you're doing it right now and it

214
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:58,420
goes back to that salience landscaping I was talking about so the amount of

215
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:02,060
information that's actually available to you in the technical definition of

216
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:08,220
information is combinatorial explosive it's astronomically vast do you know

217
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,220
the amount of information you have in your long-term memory all the possible

218
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:16,100
combinations connections you could make astronomically vast you know all the

219
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:21,500
sequences of behavior you could put together astronomically vast but you

220
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,060
know what you're doing right now out of all of the information out there all the

221
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:28,780
information in here and all the possibilities of how you could behave

222
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:36,180
you're zeroing in on the relevant information like that like that how do

223
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:41,620
you do it it's a really hard question I dedicated my life to trying to figure it

224
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:47,620
out now think about how you need that moment by moment by moment and no

225
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:50,780
one has said it's not static you're constantly shifting and notice what's

226
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:55,260
going on even right and this gives you a bit of a clue I would argue as to how

227
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:59,980
you're doing it part of your mind is trying to select and focus in and part

228
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:03,540
of your mind wants to wander off and think about other things and so part of

229
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:07,420
your mind is trying to open up possibilities and then another part is

230
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:11,260
selecting from all those possibilities right and it's doing this and that's

231
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:15,460
just like the process of evolution you have variation and selection variation

232
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:19,580
and selection so notice what that does it makes certain things about me and what

233
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:24,620
I'm saying stand out and other things you don't even consider them now that's

234
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:29,340
that's what's so cool this sounds like a Zen coin you know what makes you

235
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:33,660
intelligent your ability to ignore most of the information that's available to

236
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:38,540
you so what you're doing and this is a very technical sense is you're

237
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:44,460
biasing your attention that's how you're intelligent but you pay a price for

238
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:51,300
that you're biasing your attention and there's check there's are you're always

239
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:56,940
always subject to this vulnerability that that bias is going to turn out to be a

240
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:01,580
prejudice that you actually missed the information you needed every year until

241
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:05,420
very recently because phones have made this go down but until the advent of

242
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:09,860
cell phones this would regularly happen people would go into a dark place where

243
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:13,300
they knew there was flammable gas dispersed and they knew they needed light

244
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,940
so they would strike a match and what were they focusing on what was relevant

245
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:20,900
to them is that the match is a source of light and what they ignored was a match

246
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:26,780
is also a source of heat and they would blow themselves up right so we are

247
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:32,860
always sub so the very processes these evolving dynamic processes that make us

248
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:39,620
intelligent also make us perpetually susceptible to self-deception self

249
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:43,660
destructive self-deception and we're doing it all the time a great place

250
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:48,340
people realize this is in the romantic lives I say oh I know what I did wrong

251
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:51,300
there I'm gonna do the exact opposite with this person and then they get into

252
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:55,860
it and they go oh I'm doing it again I'm doing the same thing again although it's

253
00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:01,260
very hard for them to see it from the inside so across cultures across

254
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:08,460
historical context people have developed ecologies of practices for interacting

255
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:14,220
with this dynamic self-evolving relevance realization in order to try and

256
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:18,780
ameliorate the foolishness that self-deceptive self-destructive behavior

257
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:25,540
but there's a positive side because this is so central to you when people talk

258
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:29,060
about feeling connected that's what they're talking about they're talking

259
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:32,580
about that relevance realization it's relevant to me it's salient to me it

260
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:37,060
draws me in relevance is always about what you're caring about as opposed to

261
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:41,460
what you're ignoring and so people also not only do they need to ameliorate the

262
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:45,940
foolishness they want to enhance the connectedness so they also have

263
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:50,580
ecologies of practices that not only ameliorate the foolishness but enhance

264
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:54,620
the connectedness that connectedness is what meaning in life is

265
00:21:54,620 --> 00:22:00,660
ameliorating foolishness enhancing connectedness enhancing meaning in life

266
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:05,940
that's wisdom this is what I do with my students so that's the structural

267
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:11,380
problem we need wisdom it's not optional for us to ignore it right and if you ask

268
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:16,460
people do you want to be wiser they usually say well yeah of course do you

269
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,900
want more meaning yeah do you want to be less self-deceptive self-destructive

270
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:24,380
yeah but I'll ask my students I'll say where do you go for information oh

271
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:28,420
social media the internet where do you go for knowledge a little bit slower

272
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:34,700
science the universities then I'll say where do you go for wisdom and there's

273
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:41,340
a silence some of them a little bit a shrinking minority will say maybe my

274
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:46,780
religion but they're not very confident about that and that is the historical

275
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:52,660
issue these ecologies of practices in which we cultivate wisdom have to be

276
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:57,260
situated into a worldview that homes them that valorizes them that provides

277
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:02,020
institutions and communities when I asked you what would you do you said I'd

278
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:06,140
ask somebody if there was gunk on my glasses somebody else that's right we

279
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:10,900
need a community transformation requires community it requires and a community

280
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:14,980
requires a shared worldview and it requires right so you got a shared

281
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:19,260
worldview a community an ecology of practices that's what religion provided

282
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:27,820
and what we see historically for a lot of reasons is that is the decline the

283
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:33,180
loss of what Peter Burger calls our sacred canopy I'm not advocating for

284
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:38,540
Christianity I'm not doing that but what I'm saying is when we lost it for what

285
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:43,620
the political and metaphysical and scientific reasons that we lost it we

286
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:48,020
lost all of the functionality it provided for us in the cultivation of

287
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:53,460
wisdom and meaning and here's the problem for us the scientific worldview and

288
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:57,820
let's let I want you to remember I'm a scientist I love science but the

289
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:05,660
scientific worldview can't address that problem and here's here's what I mean the

290
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:10,580
scientific worldview has no explanation for science itself or for the

291
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:15,660
meaning-making practices of the scientists that make science possible we

292
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:22,180
and our science don't actually fit in to the scientific worldview we're a whole a

293
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:28,300
gap but like a black hole within that worldview and so the very thing that is

294
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:34,460
so successful so beautifully successful in so many domains is precisely

295
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:44,300
incapable of addressing this historical loss of a worldview that homes wisdom

296
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:48,860
and meaning I'm glad you brought that up because I did want to ask you being a part

297
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:55,140
of the scientific community can mimic a spiritual community it seems like there

298
00:24:55,140 --> 00:25:01,980
is a religion of science happening also there can be and then there even been

299
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:10,500
historical attempts like Auguste Comte to try and do that and there are I mean

300
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:14,820
one of the things you see in the history of the West is as Christianity

301
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:19,900
receded you get you get the attempt to fill in that vacuum with pseudo-religious

302
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:25,340
ideologies political movements you know I would recommend very strongly that

303
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:30,100
people consider that communism and Nazism are not just political phenomena

304
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:35,620
they're also pseudo-religious phenomena in a profound way and so I mean and

305
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:39,260
there's various ideologies left and right that people use and you can see

306
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:44,220
various academic communities trying to plug in the sense of the sacred into

307
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:48,820
the science by sort of fusing you know a particular political worldview

308
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:54,940
liberalism or leftism or right right wingism whatever right to try and do

309
00:25:54,940 --> 00:26:00,780
that because science per se can't do that the attempt to turn science into

310
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:07,300
religious framework with some people called scientism you see it happening

311
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:11,260
with the with the academic community but on on its own science really can't do

312
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:16,740
that much so it's usually glued together with a not scientifically based

313
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:24,460
allegiance to a particular socio-political economic ideological vision of what the

314
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:28,940
good life is and what good people are and what's the good what's the good

315
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:33,940
future that we should be pursuing and things like that so we're talking about

316
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:37,780
science and spirituality and one of your passions for bringing them closer

317
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:42,260
together one of the things you'd mentioned on your first episode of your

318
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:47,500
series is the different types of knowing and yeah for me like I think people

319
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:50,980
need to know about that would you mind going through thank you for bringing that

320
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:56,380
up because that that goes exactly towards the kind of bridging that's a

321
00:26:56,380 --> 00:27:04,540
wonderful question I deeply appreciate that and it's it's funny you're and I

322
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:11,020
don't mean this in any way to denigrate my my two boys who are like the jewels

323
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:15,140
of my life but your theories are kind of like your children and you don't know

324
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:18,540
which and you when you don't know which one of these is going to take off and

325
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:22,060
it's really interesting that this has been something that really that people

326
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:26,700
have found very central so the idea is and this is one of the ways in which

327
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:32,860
science is inadequate the idea is that there's four kinds of knowing and let's

328
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:36,420
start with the one that's typified in science and that's prevalent in our

329
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:40,540
culture especially in ideological movements which is propositional knowing

330
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:47,100
so this is knowing that you you practice you practice this knowing by

331
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:51,460
asserting propositions you say things like I believe that the earth is round

332
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:57,660
that's a proposition and I believe it and what I do is I gather evidence for

333
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:01,580
that particular proposition and if the evidence is enough I start to talk about

334
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:04,740
and it gives me explanatory power I start talking about a theory and I get a

335
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:08,980
sense of a conviction a sense of conviction that it's true and of course

336
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:13,420
ideologies make those same kinds of moves that's propositional knowing and for a

337
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:18,420
very long time because of the scientific revolution and Descartes and because also

338
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:22,980
of things going on in the Protestant Reformation we have started to think

339
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:27,580
that that's all knowing is just propositional knowing and we've done

340
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:31,420
we've done similar reductions we've reduced faith to belief we treat them

341
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:34,540
as if they're synonyms and we think that the most important thing for

342
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:38,940
explaining somebody's behavior are their beliefs and so we get this massive

343
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:44,540
reduction now what's happened in the cognitive science that I'm privileged

344
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:50,060
to participate in there's been a revolution going on in the last you

345
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:53,820
know 30 40 years it's called for e-cognitive science we can get into

346
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:59,940
that at some point if you want but the main idea is I draw from that is that

347
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:04,860
there are other kinds of knowing so there's procedural which isn't knowing

348
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:08,500
that something is it the case it's knowing how to do something it's knowing

349
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:13,020
how to catch a ball it's knowing how to kiss somebody right which isn't the same

350
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:18,020
thing as having a bunch of beliefs about kissing that's why you could read a lot

351
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:20,980
of books on kissing and it wouldn't make you a good kisser wouldn't make you a

352
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:26,300
good martial artist it can help but it's not it's nowhere near enough knowing

353
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:30,140
how has a lot more to do not with theories it has to do with skills about

354
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:35,180
how to right build up sensory motor patterns of interaction with the world

355
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:38,980
and and the sense of realness there isn't the sense of truth it's a sense of

356
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:43,940
power like when you have a skill you have expertise and that's why you give

357
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:47,860
authority to a doctor because they have a sense of skills obviously they have

358
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:50,740
beliefs but if they had the beliefs without the skills would you go to the

359
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:55,620
doctor no way right so that's procedural knowing it's knowing how

360
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:59,780
interestingly the forms of memory associated with the two kinds of

361
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:04,060
knowing are distinct your semantic memory your memory of facts is distinct

362
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:07,300
from your procedural memory your knowledge of skills so you can lose one

363
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:14,380
without losing the other so now related to that is another one which is think of

364
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:19,780
what you need for your skills you need what's called situational awareness so

365
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:23,060
is your skill of swimming relevant right now should you activate it should you

366
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:28,300
get you start swim now because it's not relevant here I mean if the room

367
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:32,940
suddenly flooded with water it could be so you need situational awareness to

368
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:38,180
tell you which skills to activate which skills you might need to acquire right

369
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:43,060
so what's the situational awareness what kind of knowing is that well this is

370
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:47,380
knowing what it's like to be here right now the here nowness so this is member I

371
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:52,500
mentioned it this is your knowing by salience landscaping how are you salience

372
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:56,980
landscaping how are you sizing up this situation right what's your state of mind

373
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:01,700
right so you have this this episodic memory which is a combination of your

374
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:04,900
state of mind in this situation so think of the difference in your memory

375
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:08,300
between remembering that two plus two equals four and your memory of your

376
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:14,980
last birthday one is just this fact that just hangs out the other is you recall

377
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:19,780
the situation a scene what stands out what's foregrounded what's backgrounded

378
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:23,980
and you recall your corresponding and co-determining state of mind so you

379
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:29,620
recall your perspective this is perspectival knowing now its sense of

380
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:34,660
realness isn't the conviction of truth or power we know what it is because and I

381
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:38,620
do work on this just published some papers on it with Dan Schiappi right in

382
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:42,620
terms of virtual reality so what are people looking for that they want the

383
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:47,420
game to be real what are they looking for it's called a sense of presence so

384
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:50,620
that perspectival knowing gives you a sense of realness when you have a sense

385
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:56,380
that you're really here really now really connected really present it's a sense of

386
00:31:56,380 --> 00:32:03,220
presence as a realness okay what's under that what's under that is you don't come

387
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:07,780
into this situation as a blank slate contrary to what John Locke said you

388
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:12,460
come in with your biology your biological evolutionary heritage and your

389
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:17,020
culture shaping you and the environment to fit each other this chair is

390
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:20,980
suitable for me I can sit on it that's an affordance it affords sitting it

391
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:25,180
wouldn't afford sitting for an elephant right this glass this glass is

392
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:30,020
graspable by me evolution has shaped me to pick up objects like this and then

393
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:34,620
culture has taught me to shape my hand this way and and made objects that fit

394
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:40,100
my hand so this if this for me this is graspable the graspability is not in the

395
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:44,380
glass it's not in my hand but in the way my hand and the glass have been shaped

396
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:49,820
to each other by evolution and by culture and by my ongoing state of mind

397
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:54,580
this is an idea from Gibson and it's at the core of 40 cognitive science right

398
00:32:55,140 --> 00:33:01,620
that you have right the way though you and your environment are co-shaping each

399
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:06,260
other and opening up a whole network of affordances that are available to you

400
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:10,460
for interacting with the world this is your participatory knowing this is your

401
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:14,860
knowing by being this is the relationship between your agency and how the world is

402
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:20,620
disclosed to you as an arena for action and they're mutually belonging together

403
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:26,100
now you have semantic memory for propositional knowing you have procedural

404
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:29,740
memory right for procedural knowing you have episodic memory for

405
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:34,020
perspective knowing what kind of memory do you have for this participatory

406
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:39,860
belonging in the world a profound kind of memory you call yourself your sense

407
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:45,140
of self your sense of identity this is the deep kind of memory a deep kind of

408
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:50,780
knowing so when you know something by binding yourself to it perhaps the way

409
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:55,580
you should know your partner right so your self-knowledge and your knowledge

410
00:33:55,580 --> 00:34:00,620
of your partner are bound up together and they co-evolve and they shape each

411
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:06,700
other right and the two people right more and more conform to each other and

412
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:13,220
afford each other's transformation so you know love is the the medieval's had

413
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:16,620
this that love is its own way of knowing love is a primary example of

414
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:20,180
participatory knowing the kind of knowing that you can only have by loving

415
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:26,260
something right so the participatory knowing sets out the affordances the

416
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:30,220
perspective of knowing makes certain affordances salient and stand out so

417
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:33,620
it and then that activates what skills you're going to bring into the

418
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:37,020
interaction and then as you're interacting you bring out the facts

419
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:42,020
that are relevant to your interaction and that's how they all work so the

420
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:46,380
scientific worldview locks us here in the propositional and most of that

421
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:51,580
relevance realization that connectedness is happening on at the levels of the

422
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:56,060
non propositional knowing this is another profound reason why science

423
00:34:56,060 --> 00:35:01,900
qua science can't give us the meaning now what science can do is give us the

424
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:06,140
science of those kinds of knowing so that we can better engineer the

425
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:11,420
psychotechnologies the practices that will enhance them that will make them

426
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:18,860
wiser and more meaningful enhance that connectedness so this is taking me to

427
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:23,300
altered states of consciousness I would love to talk about that of course you

428
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:31,700
should I think that so many of us are stuck focusing on the wrong things or

429
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:38,620
just at least very narrow things on our TV screens social media and the few

430
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:46,220
people that we have in our very small circles now how do you feel that how do

431
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:49,420
you feel altered states of consciousness fall into helping us with this

432
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:55,260
meaning so that is also a really profound question and I would I would

433
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:59,700
suggest to you that the renaissance of interest in psychedelics both

434
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:04,580
academically and culturally is another symptomatic response to the meaning

435
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:11,140
crisis people are craving enhanced connectedness the kind of union and

436
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:16,540
self-transcendence and as you said they're trying to break out of too narrow

437
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:21,020
of framing on reality and that's why they're seeking them out and of course

438
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:24,980
there's been a you know cross cultures cross history a long-standing

439
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:29,980
connection between psychedelics and mystical experience so they're not the

440
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:37,580
same but and and the cultivation of wisdom so we have to be very cautious

441
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:45,820
about this because we have the very thing that the very reason why people and

442
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:51,180
this is almost ironic the very reason why people might take psychedelics is the

443
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:56,500
kind of misframing they could bring to the psychedelics which is they could get

444
00:36:56,540 --> 00:37:06,140
too focused and too narrow a framing of this psychedelic experience so altered

445
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:09,340
states of consciousness psychedelic experience mystical experience one of

446
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:15,820
the ways of thinking about them one of the ways I've been arguing up with lots

447
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:19,980
of people like Dana Craig and others we've been working on this idea Jensen

448
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:28,980
Kim a bunch of people is I want you to remember an experience that probably

449
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:35,060
happens to you every day and I want to use that and put it on a continuum with

450
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:41,140
altered states so you've had an aha moment can you remember one recently

451
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:46,380
where you realized oh I'm looking at this in completely the wrong way at that

452
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:50,820
aha experience where you've been thinking about something you're right I

453
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:54,660
should think about it this way I was the wrong I was concentrating on the wrong

454
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:57,940
thing the fact that you asked me that question means you've had that experience

455
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:02,460
so I study this I study is called insight and notice what it means to see

456
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:08,380
a to see into something right so what's happening in an insight experience notice

457
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:13,420
that we often talk about it like a flash of insight what's happening is your

458
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:18,260
salience landscape is suddenly shifting often they'll represented in movies with

459
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:21,780
things coming in and out of the foreground of the background right so

460
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:26,780
what's happening is a very dynamic reconfiguration of your salience

461
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:33,140
landscape right so you ask people well what grows from an acorn and oak what's

462
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:39,420
this stroke what's the gray stuff that comes off fire smoke what's the white of

463
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:46,260
an egg called and people say the yolk and you were gonna say right but the

464
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:50,260
answer is the white of the egg but what were you doing you were concentrating on

465
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:54,540
the oak sound you foregrounded that as relevant and then so you looked for the

466
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:59,300
part of the egg that has the oak sound in it you said yolk and then you laughed

467
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:02,820
because humor is related to insight because you realized that you had

468
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:11,260
misframed the situation okay now we are doing that all the time because like I

469
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:15,860
said the relevance realization process is constantly evolving and sometimes

470
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:20,980
though that evolution goes through this dynamic shift of self-correction this is

471
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:25,820
why insight is so associated with wisdom if you ask people could somebody be not

472
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:29,460
that educated but really wise they go yeah I think so what if they weren't very

473
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:33,820
artistic could they be wise yeah I think so could they be not very insightful and

474
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:37,860
wise they go no they got to be insightful to be wise there's a deep

475
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:42,820
connection there because they realize that insight is a little micro moment of

476
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:47,060
increased wisdom it's a little moment of self-transcendence it's a little moment

477
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:50,060
when you're breaking out of that narrow frame and you've got a moment when you

478
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:54,100
realized oh I was looking at it the wrong way now what I want you to consider is

479
00:39:54,260 --> 00:40:00,340
that capacity for self-transcendence self-correction right and it comes with a

480
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:05,300
change in consciousness there's a flash it's on a continuum so if you get a

481
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:08,620
bunch of these insights at least that's what I published with Leo Ferrero and

482
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:13,260
Erin Herobinat in 2018 and you start chaining them together so an insight

483
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:16,300
leads to another insight leads to another insight like think about somebody

484
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:19,380
playing jazz they're playing jazz and they pick up and they break frame and

485
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:22,300
make a new frame and then they have to break the frame and make and they're

486
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:26,500
constantly they get into what's called the flow state athletes seek this out

487
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,900
because it's optimal you're at your very best and it feels like the most

488
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:33,300
amazing experience like in your act right so you're in the zone and I get it

489
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:36,580
like as a martial artist I get it when I'm lecturing and notice what people say

490
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:42,100
it's like they now talk about the whole world being super salient they feel that

491
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:46,620
one with their environment they feel deeply connected that's that enhanced

492
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:50,860
meaning right and flow states is when they start to feel like they're they

493
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:55,100
have that really deep connectedness but they're self-transcending they report a

494
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:59,180
loss of self-consciousness my consciousness you know that mattering

495
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:04,420
narrative nanny in your head how do I look how are people thinking of me what's

496
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:09,940
going on do they like me all of that all of that goes away because they're so at

497
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:12,660
one and like when you're a martial artist like if you're sparring in your

498
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:17,420
in your flow like it's so amazing you know at one level you're making all this

499
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:21,660
effort but your hand just goes for the block and you just find the opening for

500
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:28,220
the punch right or right or it's so that's the flow state notice how that's

501
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:31,900
already a profound altered state of consciousness now one of the interesting

502
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:36,140
features about flow Chikset Mahai has studied this for decades is it's a

503
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:41,780
universal it happens to people regardless of their gender their socio-economic

504
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:47,820
status their language their cultural background across all of this people

505
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:52,060
describe the flow experience in almost the same light the same terms of the

506
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:56,780
same level of detail so it's something profound going on because it's enhancing

507
00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:01,700
right this this relevance realization this connectedness this capacity for

508
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:07,460
self-transcendence now take flow and its altered state of consciousness and ramp

509
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:13,140
it up instead of flowing as I'm sparring right or as I'm writing poetry or as I'm

510
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:20,180
playing jazz what have I flowed at the level of my grant my relationship to

511
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:24,980
reality as a whole what have I got into a flow state at the level of my world

512
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:31,500
view so I was doing what Blake said I was seeing a world in a grain of sand

513
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:35,300
that everything is interpenetrating and I'm getting this flow that's from the

514
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:39,860
gestalt to the feature and in and out to the center of my psyche out to the

515
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:44,180
depths of the world as a flow experience and imagine how that's going to

516
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:49,580
transform your salience landscaping and how it's going to even more reduce that

517
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:54,380
that self-consciousness it's going to be like a super awe experience those are

518
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:58,020
mystical experiences and then there's an overlap between psychedelic

519
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:02,020
experiences and even lion I just I interviewed him from my one of my

520
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:05,140
channels he's writing a book it's coming out called psychedelic experience

521
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:08,820
and he points out that psychedelic experiences don't have to use substances

522
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:12,900
there's other ways of triggering them and so you got you so you got insight

523
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:18,180
flow psychedelic experiences mystical experiences and then when mystical

524
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:24,180
experiences put people in touch with what they call the really real the most

525
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:32,360
real this is what's so fascinating about it they will transform their lives their

526
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:38,460
roles their relationships often their occupation in order to conform more and

527
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:43,540
more to that really real they'll invert everything so normally what we do is the

528
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:47,580
everyday is the real and anything that's off that's aberrant from that like a

529
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:52,340
dream or when we're drunk we go that's not real people do the opposite in these

530
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:56,180
experience they have these experiences the real really real and they say that's

531
00:43:56,180 --> 00:44:02,180
real and all of this is less real and they change their lives because we want

532
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:08,260
to be in touch with what's most real and so altered states of consciousness are

533
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:15,500
are so sought after now because they give us the capacity for enhancing all of

534
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:19,300
that continuum from insight to transformative experience giving us the

535
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:25,700
self-transcendence the opportunity to get profound insight cultivate wisdom and

536
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:29,580
transform our sense of self all the kinds of knowing and so of course we're

537
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:37,660
seeking it but here's the danger here's the danger right if you don't have that

538
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:41,780
situated within an already existing ecology of practices in which you're

539
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:47,500
cultivating wisdom and a community that is giving you a worldview you can spin

540
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:52,660
off you can spin off from these altered states you can go down various rabbit

541
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:57,340
holes you can get into echo chambers you can come up with wacky metaphysics all

542
00:44:57,340 --> 00:45:03,700
kinds of strange things happening so and I get into a little bit of trouble not

543
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:08,260
like officially but with the university and also I think I pissed people off a

544
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:13,020
little bit because I say two things and it sounds like contradiction I say we

545
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:18,460
should not prohibit substances doesn't work doesn't work I'm really confident

546
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:22,980
about that doesn't work okay but we should also license the use of them like

547
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:28,060
we do for a car or a handgun these are powerful tools you don't give a five

548
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:31,500
year old a chainsaw you don't give somebody in fact who doesn't know how to

549
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:35,940
use a chainsaw a chainsaw if you're gonna cut through the cords of your life

550
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:38,900
because you're seeking profound transformation you better know how to

551
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:43,420
use that tool right it's called the mind sword in you know in some of the

552
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:47,020
Buddhist traditions you know you better learn like and that's what decisive

553
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:50,700
means by the way it means to cut right if you if you don't know how to wield

554
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:56,020
that properly there's a potential for getting into some very significant

555
00:45:56,020 --> 00:46:02,900
self-deceptive self-destructive behavior so I think that if we're cultivating

556
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:06,460
altered states of consciousness through mindfulness practices through movement

557
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:10,860
practices through group practices through the use of substances through

558
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:15,900
breathing techniques that should always be properly situated within a

559
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:23,340
sapiential sacred community I can see the problem with that argument where many

560
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:28,340
things that are licensed start to become really rigid so I'd imagine that the

561
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:34,100
whole licensing process of this look very different than anything else I mean

562
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:39,300
we talk about doulas for example yeah licensing at least in the US for a long

563
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:45,620
time because of that yes about the person and how can you license or restrict

564
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:50,100
how that process goes for each human well we do it for other things so here's my

565
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:55,220
counter example and you know this has become you know the case and there was

566
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:59,380
this discussion around it but we do it with psychotherapy we like it's now the

567
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:04,180
law that you can't practice psychotherapy unless you are approved by the

568
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:08,680
college and the idea here is because we're engaging in something that has the

569
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:13,780
capacity to you know radically transform people and therefore there is a power

570
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:20,180
and we have to make sure that people have both the scientific and the skill and

571
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:25,060
I would even add perhaps the moral training education so that they will

572
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:30,160
wield that power responsibly thank you okay I want to back up to something about

573
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:37,340
insight that it was great that you brought together the humor is human

574
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:41,260
insight somehow go together yes so humor from all the people that we've

575
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:46,180
interviewed so far has come up humor and martial art yes interestingly enough

576
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:50,380
and it was funny I was thinking about the aha moment how it's like a aha moment

577
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:55,060
yeah yeah yeah that's great I like that did you come up with that I have that's

578
00:47:55,060 --> 00:48:03,220
beautiful I like that so I was right you can talk a little bit more about humor

579
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:11,380
and how that plays a role oh cognitive science but also very much and one of

580
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:17,380
the things that intrigued me is you know the cross-cultural for study of spiritual

581
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:20,920
traditions that have humor in them Zen has a lot of humor in it and others

582
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:29,260
where the humor is much more much more backgrounded and held down so humor these

583
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:37,180
three things are related humor metaphor and insight and and they don't come

584
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:41,940
naturally to human beings we have to practice it with kids for a long time so

585
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:47,740
try and get a four-year-old to tell a joke they're not very good at it try and

586
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:51,500
get them to understand metaphor they're not very good at it and their insight

587
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:57,660
capacity is also not that explicit to them so one of the ways of thinking about

588
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:04,920
this goes to work that's been really developed well by you McGill

589
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:09,700
Kristen I was privileged to have a conversation with him about but it lines

590
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:16,380
up with work from Cuneas Beeman Bowden a whole bunch of people that they have a

591
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:20,340
book called the Eureka factor having to do with the relationship between the

592
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:28,020
hemispheres so we were talking about like your ability to solve problems and

593
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:31,340
humor is actually making use of the problem-solving ability so I am getting

594
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:38,580
there right now there's two kinds of problems you're facing all the time one

595
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:43,260
is a problem that's very familiar to you it's very well-defined look like a

596
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:47,820
prototypical example is a multiplication problem you know what kind of problem it

597
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:50,740
is you know the actions you're supposed to perform you know when you're doing it

598
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:53,940
right you know when it's doing wrong you know what the results supposed to look

599
00:49:53,940 --> 00:50:00,300
like very well-defined problem now compare solving a multiplication

600
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:06,380
problem with going on a successful first date what's the rule there so what's the

601
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:10,820
initial state well you're with some stranger okay what kind of problem is

602
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:19,100
this well what should I do I don't know like when I was dating I remember did

603
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:23,940
the advice my friends would give me was so useless was like look at her eyes but

604
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:28,660
not too much laugh at her jokes but not too often try to be funny but not to ask

605
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:37,380
questions but it's like right and so these are called ill-defined problems

606
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:44,380
and ill-defined problems are pervasive in your environment and what your brain is

607
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:47,660
really struggling to do again the framing is try and convert as many of

608
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:50,540
those ill-defined problems into well-defined problems that you can

609
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:56,540
build up habits and routines for right left hemisphere is about well-defined

610
00:50:56,540 --> 00:51:01,740
problems step-by-step narrow focus attention to detail not language that we

611
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:06,140
people say languages in both hemispheres and that's stuff about drawing on the

612
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:09,220
right side of your brain and you have an artist in your right hemisphere and you

613
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:12,860
have some sort of fascist in your left hemisphere that's all ridiculous but the

614
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:18,620
left hemisphere tends to focus on well-defined problems the right tends

615
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:24,180
to focus on ill-defined problems so instead of focusing on detail it reaches

616
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:28,300
for the gestalt so think of like I think of a classic ill-defined problem

617
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:34,020
predator something's attacking you like you don't oh well what kind of predator

618
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:38,820
is it let's get very clear you're dead right so you want to do open up you want

619
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:43,420
to gestalt you it's ill-defined you want some very coarse-grained things you want

620
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:47,700
to grab associations as fast as you can so what typically happens when people

621
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:52,300
come into situations that are very ill-defined is you can see activity

622
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:59,260
being initially predominant in the left of the right hemisphere now what happens

623
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:03,180
in insight is you come to a problem and you think you know how to frame it oh

624
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:07,740
yes I know how to do this the left hemisphere is very dominant and then

625
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:13,860
you realize I don't know how to do this and you'll see the aha moment is when

626
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:18,900
activity shifts from the left to the right and then what happens in the right

627
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:24,380
is in here you're you're you're working within a frame and in here you're going

628
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:28,140
all that frames don't and now you're looking for a frame and then when you

629
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:31,100
get an alternative frame you bring it back you reframe your problem and that

630
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:40,380
that that's aha something else that does that is metaphor metaphor also does

631
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:47,620
that shift so when I say and we notice notice how much your cognition is

632
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:54,140
drenched in metaphor I just did it by the way so you'll say things like we're

633
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:59,540
halfway through this interview halfway way through we're not moving through

634
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:05,140
space the interview I hope it's not too hard John I hope right I hope you're

635
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:09,380
seeing what I'm saying I hope you're getting it I hope you're understanding

636
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:15,940
it I hope you're right to see in fact try to say anything profound and

637
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:20,380
meaningful to somebody without invoking a metaphor because you're trying to

638
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:24,060
afford insight this is the work of lake often Johnson although I have some

639
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:32,020
criticisms of the specifics of their theory okay so metaphor and insight and

640
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:36,900
we use metaphor we use propositional metaphors to try and trigger non-

641
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:43,780
propositional insight so and of course Shakespeare is an exemplar of this

642
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:53,380
humor involves metaphor when it's verbal humor of some kind right and it

643
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:58,300
involves a sudden reframing you have to get the punchline you have to have the

644
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:03,420
aha moment that's why people will often retrospectively see a failure of

645
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:10,980
insight as something funny they'll go oh haha so humor is it like one of the

646
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:15,900
things you're doing when somebody gets a joke right is you're playing with things

647
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:22,140
you know don't live leave alphabet soup on the you know boiling on the stove it

648
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:29,140
could spell disaster okay it's a bad joke but but the point is notice how I'm

649
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:33,020
playing right on two different meanings and moving between them and you got to

650
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:36,740
shift the meaning right you got a reframe you have to have that insight and

651
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:40,740
you do it retrospectively and it alleviates the tension between like

652
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:44,500
there's a there's an initial problem and then you resolve it with insight and you

653
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:49,460
play with sort of the metaphorical aspects of language we've got humor and

654
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:53,580
then with other humor that's non-verbal we're doing sort of something

655
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:58,540
analogously I would argue with like perspectival knowing things like that so

656
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:05,260
humor metaphor insight are bound together and you can see why people who are

657
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:10,740
seeking transformation would rely on them because they're what you're doing is

658
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:16,700
you're trying to fuel and prime the engine of cognitive flexibility of your

659
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:24,140
ability to reframe right and to alter what's salient and relevant to you in a

660
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:28,820
way that connects to you that matters to you that's meaningful to you and of

661
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:34,700
course that's going to help you take ill-defined situations like when

662
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:40,100
something traumatic has happened to us or when some opportunity that's golden

663
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:44,180
has suddenly opened up to us should I get involved with that person should I

664
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:48,620
try that new career we're going to turn to these as a way of trying to enhance

665
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:52,820
our ability to deal with ill-defined situations

666
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:58,460
I need to believe so many people are resistant to taking their glasses off and

667
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:09,860
seeing what's on there because I mean part of it is part of it is cultural we

668
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:15,820
have truncated and reduced people's sense of their mind and their self and

669
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:22,620
those aren't identical but they're related and so we people don't when

670
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:27,740
people don't have the ability to access that cognitive flexibility and when

671
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:31,660
they're in a meaning scarcity this is called scarcity mentality when human

672
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:37,140
beings face any significant scarcity of food water of you know friendship

673
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:41,940
relationship meaning they become very rigid they become very narrow they become

674
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:48,700
very short-term in their thinking this is why you know sort of you know blaming

675
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:52,860
people for bad behavior because they're poor is is perhaps getting things the

676
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:58,380
wrong way around right instead right you think of people in scarcity so if we've

677
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:02,420
taken all of the meaning and wisdom machinery away and we've really reduced

678
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:06,500
people's sense of what they're what they are you are your beliefs and they're

679
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:12,740
shrunk down here and they're starving of course they're going to be resistant to

680
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:17,300
taking their glasses off they're going to be rigid and resistant and they're in

681
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:24,380
fact they're going to double down on holding on to the beliefs with which

682
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:30,140
they identify if you feel comfortable talking about this I'm not sure if this

683
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:37,340
is your area of expertise so rebel wisdom yes they talk about sense-making yes

684
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:44,380
sense-making and meaning making what's the relationship between them so they're

685
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:48,980
they're they're they overlap to a great degree so sense-making was a term coined

686
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:55,340
I think I believe by maybe it was O'Shamel but it was made prominent by

687
00:57:55,340 --> 00:58:00,620
Francisco Varela who is one of the pioneers of 4e cognitive science and

688
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:07,020
then by my former colleague Evan Thompson who is like if you want to

689
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:10,020
understand 4e cognitive science you have to look at Evan's work Evan is

690
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:19,220
brilliant and profound and it was it was a loss when he left University of

691
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:25,260
Toronto go to UBC so they coined this term of sense-making and the the basic

692
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:34,140
idea is this that even a paramecium right is doing it's detecting its

693
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:39,780
environment right and it's adapting and responding and so in its sensory motor

694
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:44,860
behavior it's it is treating it's not seeing it doesn't have consciousness or

695
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:54,120
everything like that but it's detecting this molecule as food food isn't part of

696
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:57,780
physics like if you look in a physics textbook you won't you won't find a

697
00:58:57,780 --> 00:59:01,620
definition for food food is an affordance relationship between this

698
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:07,180
chemical and this the autopoiesis the self-making of the paramecium the

699
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:10,660
paramecium because it's constantly taking care of itself because it's a

700
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:14,340
living thing it's caring about this I don't mean full blow in emotion but

701
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:18,660
there's a kind of caring very small scale right there's a kind of caring of

702
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:24,540
and it's also that molecule is poison so it swims away from that one and swims

703
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:29,300
towards this one so it's doing sense-making it's making sense of its

704
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:34,740
right of its environment now if you lift that sense-making up into what we

705
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:40,220
could call kinds of knowing then the sense-making I would argue is meaning

706
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:45,860
making in this time right now where people are trying to make sense of so

707
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:52,700
much why do you do you feel that this is a skill that people could work to get

708
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:57,700
better at I would be I'd be really strong about that I would say it's a

709
00:59:57,700 --> 01:00:04,020
necessity if you do not get better at waiting through all the bullshit and I

710
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:07,580
use that in a very technical sense maybe you can ask me about that but if we do

711
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:10,620
not get better and one of the other symptoms of the meeting crisis we

712
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:13,940
track this in the book is people feel like bullshit and bullshitting is

713
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:18,340
expanding both quantitatively there's more of it and it's in more domains and

714
01:00:18,340 --> 01:00:23,660
it's people are getting more and more shameless about the bullshitting which

715
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:30,500
is really egregious if you don't do something about that toxicity right the

716
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:38,700
way that that is radically undermining your capacity to connect to reality and

717
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:43,540
exacerbating making you more and more prone to self-deceptive self-destructive

718
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:50,420
behavior if you don't do anything about that given the way right social media is

719
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:54,020
complexifying and with it the bullshitting is complexifying and

720
01:00:54,020 --> 01:00:59,100
permeating your life and percolating into the depths of the psyche and ways

721
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:02,540
you're not aware of if you're watching if you're using lots of social media I

722
01:01:02,540 --> 01:01:07,020
will predict that you are suffering more depression and anxiety I'm confident

723
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:14,100
about that if you don't do something to address and ameliorate that I strongly

724
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:19,460
predict it's going to get worse for you with time and not only with you as an

725
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:23,300
individual but with you and your group

726
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:32,700
would you explain echo chambers sure so remember we talked about you know the

727
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:38,660
way we we have to focus in and and and these are very adaptive now one of the

728
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:44,660
things you do and I do too is we do what's called the confirmation bias now

729
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:48,900
in a lot of environments this is adaptive so I want I want to understand

730
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:52,780
that I want you to understand that but what does it mean well what does it mean

731
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:58,980
is generally we don't look for information that challenges or

732
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:04,140
disconfirms our belief we look for information that supports it that's

733
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:09,500
confirmation bias again one more time right in a lot of environments messy

734
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:14,900
environments complex environments right that's adaptive that's why we do it but

735
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:20,980
it makes us vulnerable to environments that aren't ones we evolved to fit like

736
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:27,980
the internet where we can rapidly get access to hundreds and hundreds of

737
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:32,700
people confirming our belief in something and then when that goes to that

738
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:36,700
starvation for meaning then we don't want to give up any beliefs we can just

739
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:41,420
again and then we can we can just do this we I can reinforce your confirmation

740
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:45,620
bias you can reinforce mine my my collaborator and good friend Leo

741
01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:49,580
Ferrero he calls this confirmation porn we can get into this kind of

742
01:02:49,580 --> 01:02:56,420
pornography of just confirming and confirming and we get locked in and

743
01:02:56,420 --> 01:03:00,780
then we more and more identify with it because you're telling me yeah yeah

744
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:04,700
that's the way the world is and so I'm more and more and then we just cycle in

745
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:10,660
this is a phenomenon that my friend and colleague Mark Lewis in his work on

746
01:03:10,660 --> 01:03:17,020
addiction calls reciprocal narrowing and then I think that the and I said I

747
01:03:17,020 --> 01:03:21,060
said this to Mark I think the platonic wisdom tradition talks about an opposite

748
01:03:21,060 --> 01:03:26,740
thing we can cultivate which is reciprocal opening so echo chambers are

749
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:30,860
reciprocal narrowing and when look think what happens to the addict the addict

750
01:03:30,860 --> 01:03:35,380
loses cognitive flexibility and so their options in the world go down so the

751
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:40,140
world gets more and more narrow and then they internalize that and then they get

752
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:44,820
more and more narrow and that until I can't be any other than I am the world

753
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:49,620
can't be any other than it is and that's addiction so this echo chambering is

754
01:03:49,620 --> 01:03:53,580
very analogous to that reciprocal narrowing that's going on in addiction

755
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:57,780
and we we are addicted to a lot of stuff I mean the addiction crisis as I

756
01:03:57,780 --> 01:04:03,140
mentioned is one of the issue we're more and more finding ourselves addicted to

757
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:06,980
more and more things and there's more and more people that are exploiting us

758
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:13,140
politically economically by getting us addicted and the internet has algorithms

759
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:20,180
that do that. I think that this is a really really important topic right now

760
01:04:20,180 --> 01:04:27,580
because PTSD is a household term yes but post-traumatic growth very few people

761
01:04:27,580 --> 01:04:31,780
have even heard of that I know the lack of awareness that things can be great on

762
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:35,660
the other side of difficult experiences that just seems like a responsible thing

763
01:04:35,660 --> 01:04:41,620
to know yes talk about so this is a serious concern of ours as we put this

764
01:04:41,620 --> 01:04:46,180
documentary out there is an invalidation or perception of an invalidation of an

765
01:04:46,180 --> 01:04:50,980
experience people assuming that because we're talking about post-traumatic

766
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:56,060
growth PTSD doesn't exist or we're anti PTSD and so I would love to talk to you

767
01:04:56,060 --> 01:05:01,300
about this or if you can explain a little bit about or just if I were to speak on

768
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:09,940
behalf of that person right now my echo chamber makes me feel heard you know I

769
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:15,220
feel like I have a community yes I'm infertile and I'm seeing how hard other

770
01:05:15,220 --> 01:05:20,020
women have it yes yes that feels good but to what extent and when does that

771
01:05:20,020 --> 01:05:25,780
become a negative experience right and so that's that's a really beautiful

772
01:05:25,780 --> 01:05:31,180
question I thought that's well well framed and a problem well framed is you

773
01:05:31,180 --> 01:05:38,980
know the the beginning of insight so I mean there's a lot of variables and and

774
01:05:38,980 --> 01:05:44,980
the and this is not to derail what we're doing but the literature on you know

775
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:48,140
post-traumatic growth is going like the scientific literature is in this

776
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:52,860
liminal place because we're sort of through first wave and then there's been

777
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:56,620
a second critical wave and now people are coming out of that and there so we're

778
01:05:56,660 --> 01:06:04,180
trying to get a more sophisticated answer to a very complex phenomenon but let's

779
01:06:04,180 --> 01:06:08,700
go back to the so I want I want that as sort of the general frame in which we're

780
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:12,100
talking about this let's go back to the what's the difference between a support

781
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:18,460
group like AA and right an echo chamber because they do share important

782
01:06:18,460 --> 01:06:25,540
similarities and so one of the things you given what we've said one of the things

783
01:06:25,660 --> 01:06:28,740
you should look for at least a set of things is you should look for is your

784
01:06:28,740 --> 01:06:35,700
group actually promoting cognitive flexibility is it promoting reciprocal

785
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:40,100
opening is it helping you to gain more flexibility are you having more aha

786
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:44,180
moments now the thing about these groups is they give you initial oh I didn't

787
01:06:44,180 --> 01:06:48,180
realize that the leprechauns were behind it all and stuff like that right so

788
01:06:48,180 --> 01:06:53,860
right and they give you sort of pseudo insight so you have to ask yourself this

789
01:06:53,980 --> 01:06:59,220
question are the insights in the cognitive flexibility within the group

790
01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:04,820
transferring to your life outside of the group let me give you a really good

791
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:09,300
analogy for this think about different kinds of video games or let's comply

792
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:13,860
one kind I'm not saying all video games are like this I'm not let's say one kind

793
01:07:13,860 --> 01:07:18,100
of video game and something like Tai Chi Chuan and this was a transformative

794
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:22,580
thing for me not the video games of the Tai Chi Chuan okay so you know people

795
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:27,620
one of the reasons kids love video games is because video games are flow induction

796
01:07:27,620 --> 01:07:32,260
machines they they're they're like jazz they are reliable for putting people

797
01:07:32,260 --> 01:07:42,100
into the flow state right so within that world they're just but you get video

798
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:48,340
game addiction the WHO has designated an addiction when that doesn't transfer to

799
01:07:48,340 --> 01:07:54,740
your life so the skills like all and the perspective of the states of

800
01:07:54,740 --> 01:07:57,620
consciousness in mind their sense of identity and self because you're

801
01:07:57,620 --> 01:08:00,420
manipulating those and video games like a religion

802
01:08:02,580 --> 01:08:06,980
right is that is that percolating through the rest of your psyche is it

803
01:08:06,980 --> 01:08:09,540
permeating through your life is it transferring

804
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:15,380
when I was doing Tai Chi and I started back in 91

805
01:08:15,380 --> 01:08:21,940
before cell phones right the ancient times I was in grad school like I said I

806
01:08:21,940 --> 01:08:25,860
was doing the Tai Chi for cultivating wisdom I was in grad school at the time

807
01:08:27,460 --> 01:08:30,980
and it's funny because when you're in grad school you're always you always feel like

808
01:08:30,980 --> 01:08:34,180
you're an imposter right I don't really belong here they're going to find out

809
01:08:34,180 --> 01:08:40,660
eventually right the people came up to me my friends and I've been doing the

810
01:08:40,740 --> 01:08:45,460
Tai Chi like religiously in both senses of the word I was doing it every day for

811
01:08:45,460 --> 01:08:49,060
two or three hours a day and I was having all these amazing experiences you know

812
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:53,060
the days when you you're as hot as fire and the days where you're as cold as ice

813
01:08:53,060 --> 01:08:58,500
and you're getting into the flow state and it's amazing but I was just I was just in that world

814
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:05,460
they came up to me and they said what's up with you what do you mean they said you're different

815
01:09:05,460 --> 01:09:10,420
you're way more flexible in your thinking you're way more empathetic and picking up on other

816
01:09:10,420 --> 01:09:19,220
people you're way more balanced in your argumentation and I realized oh the Tai Chi was moving beyond

817
01:09:19,220 --> 01:09:24,260
the martial art arena and it was percolating through my psyche it's permeating through my

818
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:27,940
lives it was transforming and that's because I wasn't just doing the Tai Chi Chuan I was doing

819
01:09:27,940 --> 01:09:33,220
these ecologies and I was learning the philosophy of Taoism and so it was like and that's what

820
01:09:33,220 --> 01:09:40,020
religions do they give you these and it does that that's my criteria if you're in your support

821
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:47,300
group and whatever's happening here you feel that it's percolating through your psyche in a way

822
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:55,060
that's permeating through your life and opening up your life and you've got a support group if you

823
01:09:55,060 --> 01:10:01,620
feel it's taking you down and you're getting locked in and you can only find that in the group

824
01:10:02,420 --> 01:10:07,460
then you're moving towards an addiction you're moving towards kind of spirituality

825
01:10:07,540 --> 01:10:13,700
you're moving towards a cult now those are on a continuum I present them as opposites for contrast

826
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:17,780
but we they're on a continuum and there's going to be stuff in the gray zone it's going to be I'm

827
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:21,780
not sure when I get that and that's going to take discernment and discussion and reflection

828
01:10:21,780 --> 01:10:29,620
but that's how I would say is it open are you reciprocally opening comprehensively

829
01:10:29,620 --> 01:10:33,780
about across more and more in your life are your existing relationships getting better

830
01:10:33,780 --> 01:10:38,340
are you feeling more in touch with reality are you able to cultivate new friendships are you

831
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:44,340
able to cultivate new virtues the answer is yes chances are you have a support group if the answer

832
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:49,060
to those increasingly if those is increasingly no chances are you're locking you're locking into

833
01:10:49,060 --> 01:11:00,660
an echo chamber thank you okay last question for me um is are there any other areas of research

834
01:11:00,660 --> 01:11:08,500
that if you had another you that can explore whatever and you just don't have time for right

835
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:14,340
now is there any like like epigenetics or something that feel like could be a really cool thread to go

836
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:24,100
down with your work oh boy um I I joke with my colleagues um like my dear friend Dan Chappie

837
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:27,380
we've published a bunch of stuff together we're always working together I don't know if you know

838
01:11:27,380 --> 01:11:32,500
but there's a there's a science fiction classic show called Dr. Who and he has the TARDIS which is

839
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:36,420
you know trans dimensional and all this I want a TARDIS where I can go in there and be outside

840
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:41,220
time and space and do a bunch of stuff and then come back out there I have to tell you Jessica

841
01:11:41,220 --> 01:11:46,740
there's so many books that I'm like I'm currently reading about 30 books at a time it's a skill I've

842
01:11:46,740 --> 01:11:51,220
been cultivating for like three decades I don't recommend it for anybody as a novice but even

843
01:11:51,220 --> 01:11:57,060
that I feel like just I look at all the books I'm not reading and I go I need to know this because

844
01:11:57,060 --> 01:12:03,940
you know I'm more ignorant than than than than I have knowledge I would like to know a lot more

845
01:12:03,940 --> 01:12:14,580
about neuroscience I would like to know a lot more about like I I've studied some I've studied both

846
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:18,980
from the outside as an academic and from the inside as a practitioner Taoism and Buddhism

847
01:12:18,980 --> 01:12:23,940
Christianity Neil Platonism Stoicism but there's a whole bunch like I don't know very much about

848
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:31,140
Islam not enough about Judaism not enough about lots of aspects of Hinduism Vedanta the indigenous

849
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:36,420
stuff I know a bit about shamanism but to equate that to indigenous culture is like terrifically

850
01:12:36,420 --> 01:12:43,300
racist and ethnocentric so I admit that I'm mostly ignorant I want to know I just yeah like so I

851
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:50,580
the hard neuroscience up to you know you know the cultural anthropology those are the two ends of

852
01:12:50,580 --> 01:12:56,820
my where I feel that I need to know more that's where I mean I need to fill in a lot in between

853
01:12:56,820 --> 01:13:02,420
that sounded arrogant pretentious but where I feel the gap most prominently is on those ends

854
01:13:03,460 --> 01:13:05,940
awesome thank you thank you so much
