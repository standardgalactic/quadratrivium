WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:25.920
my name is John Rovicki perfect okay John so would you tell us a little bit

00:25.920 --> 00:31.760
about what you do for a living what is your life's work the main thing I guess

00:31.760 --> 00:38.160
is I have sort of two things I'm doing one is I'm a bona fide academic I'm an

00:38.160 --> 00:42.640
associate professor at the University of Toronto in cognitive psychology and

00:42.640 --> 00:47.080
cognitive science so I study the nature of cognition how we learn solve

00:47.080 --> 00:52.200
problems I also study related phenomena like wisdom meaning in life

00:52.200 --> 00:56.400
consciousness mindfulness altered states of consciousness mystical

00:56.400 --> 01:01.040
experiences and so that's something I've been studying as a long time as an

01:01.040 --> 01:05.080
academic I'm also a longtime practitioner I been practicing meditation

01:05.080 --> 01:10.840
contemplation Tai Chi Chuan for like 30 years so that's one thing I'm doing and

01:10.840 --> 01:18.160
then starting I guess about was it 2019 I started an online presence I did a

01:18.160 --> 01:22.680
video series called awakening from the meaning crisis in which I was

01:22.680 --> 01:26.600
addressing the issue that most people are finding increasingly finding it

01:26.600 --> 01:31.840
increasingly difficult to find meaning in life and to get a framework in which

01:31.840 --> 01:36.520
they can cultivate wisdom or perhaps even an appreciation of the sacred within

01:36.520 --> 01:41.160
a scientific worldview and then I've been doing a lot of series around that and

01:41.160 --> 01:45.120
trying to get those two things those two aspects of my life thankfully are

01:45.120 --> 01:48.880
mutually supportive and to try and get them even better coordinated to try and

01:48.880 --> 01:54.680
address the meaning crisis that I mentioned great what is it about your

01:54.680 --> 01:59.600
personality or even the events that have happened in your past life that got

01:59.600 --> 02:05.120
you interested in all these different things well that's a really good question

02:05.120 --> 02:12.720
and so for me the the pivotal moment or at least the pivotal episode perhaps it's

02:12.720 --> 02:16.880
a better way of putting it I was brought up in a fundamentalist Christian

02:16.880 --> 02:22.140
family and of course I love my family this is extended family and so I'm not

02:22.140 --> 02:29.200
trying to criticize them as people but I found I guess given my personality my

02:29.200 --> 02:34.120
own line of psychosocial development that I found that experience ultimately

02:34.120 --> 02:39.480
traumatizing it really had a sort of profound negative impact on me but it

02:39.480 --> 02:45.120
is very sort of bivalent for me because your first religion well we have this

02:45.120 --> 02:49.320
term your mother tongue the first language you you you learn is with you

02:49.320 --> 02:53.280
always and it informs everything else well you can you sort of have like a

02:53.280 --> 02:58.800
mother religion too and so it left the taste in my mouth if I can put it that

02:58.800 --> 03:03.160
way for transcendence and for seeking deeper connection and meaning in a sense

03:03.160 --> 03:08.200
for the sacred dimension to reality but at the same time I was traumatized by

03:08.200 --> 03:13.760
the existing religion and then I was I basically set out on this path to try

03:13.760 --> 03:18.760
and resolve that sort of meaning crisis I was experiencing myself and when I was

03:18.760 --> 03:22.240
in university I encountered the figure of Socrates in the cultivation of wisdom

03:22.240 --> 03:27.840
and this opened up an avenue for me and so from there I started going down the

03:27.840 --> 03:34.600
road but the academic study of wisdom it drops off the table after like first

03:34.600 --> 03:39.480
year university even within philosophy which is ironic given that the love of

03:39.480 --> 03:44.680
wisdom is literally what philosophy means now I went on to studies philosophy

03:44.680 --> 03:48.600
because I valued the sort of meta science and medical to critique and the

03:48.600 --> 03:53.560
tools it was giving but that hunger for wisdom and transcendence was missing and

03:53.560 --> 03:58.080
so I started I went to a place and I started learning Tai Chi Chuan and

03:58.080 --> 04:03.560
meditation and contemplation and then that started to really satisfy that

04:03.600 --> 04:12.640
hunger for wisdom and transcendence but for me as I was doing this right the

04:12.640 --> 04:17.440
cognitive science world was starting to move more and more towards these topics

04:17.440 --> 04:22.840
and when I started to talk about these topics within my academic courses at

04:22.840 --> 04:27.040
the university I was noticing that they were really catching with the students

04:27.040 --> 04:30.640
these were the things they were like getting really fascinated in I think it

04:30.640 --> 04:33.440
was the first person at the University of Toronto to start talking about my

04:33.480 --> 04:37.080
mindfulness within a scientific perspective and then they started asking

04:37.080 --> 04:42.120
me to teach the courses on meditation contemplation extracurricular and I did

04:42.120 --> 04:48.360
that for a long time and so I noticed this confluence and I noticed that many

04:48.360 --> 04:52.920
of my students were resonating with that confluence and so I started to do more

04:52.920 --> 04:57.640
and more about building that bridge the bridge between science and spirituality

04:57.640 --> 04:59.640
to address the meeting crisis

04:59.640 --> 05:03.040
I really resonate with that on a personal level I always thought that that's what

05:03.040 --> 05:08.640
college was supposed to be like and you expand you have these transcended experiences

05:08.640 --> 05:10.640
but not that for me.

05:10.640 --> 05:20.200
And your case is not by any means unique many of the students after sorry this

05:20.200 --> 05:24.120
isn't meant to be self-promotional but many students after they're taking the

05:24.120 --> 05:27.560
classes with me they will say something like that this is what I wanted

05:27.560 --> 05:31.800
University to be and I don't know why the other courses aren't like that so

05:31.800 --> 05:37.400
yeah very much there's a there's a need that's not being met right now now to be

05:37.400 --> 05:40.560
fair there's a lot of other people like me doing this kind of work and one of the

05:40.560 --> 05:46.160
advantages gifts of doing my series was I've got I've been able to meet them and

05:46.160 --> 05:49.160
started interacting with them.

05:49.160 --> 05:54.160
You had mentioned meditation and contemplation. Now meditation is something that many people are

05:54.160 --> 06:00.160
familiar with whether they do it correctly or not but contemplation is a

06:00.160 --> 06:04.160
word that you don't hear too often and I was wondering if you could explain a little bit about that.

06:04.160 --> 06:09.160
This goes right towards my academic work but it also is something that I use

06:09.160 --> 06:12.760
when I'm trying to train I talk about two languages we you have to coordinate

06:12.760 --> 06:16.260
there's a language of explaining which you'd use in science and then there's a

06:16.260 --> 06:19.160
language of training which you're using when people are trying to cultivate

06:19.160 --> 06:23.560
things so let me let's not talk initially about meditation and contemplation

06:23.560 --> 06:28.360
let's talk about their common root in attention and so what I want you to notice

06:28.360 --> 06:33.360
is that your attention is we have a sort of a like a spotlight model of

06:33.360 --> 06:37.260
attention that what we do is shine our attention and on something that makes it

06:37.260 --> 06:42.200
stand out and that's right in so far as attention changes how things stand out

06:42.200 --> 06:46.800
for you how salient they are but there's a lot more going on so for one thing one

06:46.800 --> 06:50.160
of the things you can do with your attention is you can focus on me as a

06:50.160 --> 06:55.880
whole gestalt or you can zoom in to a feature and you go back and forth and

06:55.880 --> 07:00.440
that's dynamic you're constantly doing it because of what Marlo Ponte called an

07:00.440 --> 07:03.560
optimal grip like you're constantly like it when you're looking at my hand

07:03.560 --> 07:07.560
depends what your what your goal is whether or not you focus like let's say

07:07.560 --> 07:10.920
if you wanted to see if I was married you might look at the ring finger but if

07:10.920 --> 07:13.840
you want to see if I worked with my hands a lot you might go more gestalt

07:13.840 --> 07:18.560
like you're gonna move in and out until you get the balance between detail and

07:18.560 --> 07:21.720
the whole and you're constantly doing that with your attention gestalt and

07:21.720 --> 07:26.240
feature so you're constantly doing that but there's another thing you can do

07:26.240 --> 07:32.720
and let me use an analogy for that it's one that's become a somewhat of a mean

07:32.720 --> 07:37.400
for my work but it's still good maybe that's why it became a mean and so I

07:37.400 --> 07:43.760
use this when I'm teaching also my students meditation and I want you to

07:43.760 --> 07:48.540
notice something think about my glasses my glasses are literally framing my

07:48.540 --> 07:52.780
experience there's right and I'm looking through them in both senses of the

07:52.780 --> 07:58.020
word I'm looking past them and by means of them now so right now my glasses are

07:58.020 --> 08:03.540
actually transparent to me but I can do this sometimes I have to step back and

08:03.540 --> 08:08.460
look at my glasses rather than looking right through them so now my glasses are

08:08.460 --> 08:12.380
opaque and why would I do that because I might want to clear some gunk off on my

08:12.380 --> 08:20.660
glasses right you're always mentally framing so your mind you're not at most

08:20.660 --> 08:24.340
the time looking at your mind you're looking through your mind at the world

08:24.340 --> 08:29.500
and you're framing it in terms of what you're focusing in on as salient what

08:29.500 --> 08:33.620
you're focusing in on as relevant what your backgrounding and foregrounding do

08:33.620 --> 08:36.580
you see how dynamic it is like soon as you and it's been it's constantly

08:36.580 --> 08:40.700
shifting it's like this I call it a shifting salience landscape so you're

08:40.700 --> 08:47.700
constantly doing that now just like your glasses are transparent to you and you

08:47.700 --> 08:52.340
might not notice how they're distorting your vision your mental framing can be

08:52.340 --> 08:56.020
transparent to you and you're not noticed and what you do in meditation is you

08:56.020 --> 09:00.940
first learn to step back and look at your mental framing rather than looking

09:00.940 --> 09:05.420
through it this is really what's meant by centering your attention it doesn't

09:05.420 --> 09:09.540
mean just focusing it's you're stepping back and looking at and you also are

09:09.540 --> 09:14.900
trying to break up the Gestalt patterns into the feature details right so

09:14.900 --> 09:18.420
you're stepping back and looking at the mind right and then instead of just

09:18.420 --> 09:21.900
gestalting you're also going in and trying to break up the features notice

09:21.900 --> 09:26.300
the patterns and processes that are going on because you're trying to see how

09:26.300 --> 09:30.660
that might be distorting now think about this that's a valuable thing to do in

09:30.660 --> 09:33.740
meditation but what would you need to do in order to see if you've actually

09:33.900 --> 09:39.500
cleaned your glasses what would you need to do wow no because what I would

09:39.500 --> 09:48.300
think you'd do first is put them on and see if you see differently right that's

09:48.300 --> 09:52.700
what contemplation is contemplation is going the other way it's trying to look

09:52.700 --> 09:59.620
more deeply into reality and to grab the the big picture the Gestalt and to see

09:59.900 --> 10:04.860
if you can seem better than you could before that's contemplation the word

10:04.860 --> 10:09.100
contemplation you can hear the word temple in contemplation temple means to

10:09.100 --> 10:15.260
to look out to look up to the sky the Latin contemplatio is a translation of

10:15.260 --> 10:19.140
the Greek word theoria which means to look deeply it's where we get our word

10:19.140 --> 10:23.260
theory from to look deeply into things and so what you have to do is you

10:23.260 --> 10:26.620
actually have to cycle between these you have to step back and see if it's

10:26.620 --> 10:31.020
distorting you make changes and see if that makes a difference in how you see

10:31.020 --> 10:35.020
the world and if you see the world and you start to see how more how it really

10:35.020 --> 10:39.620
is that guides you in saying oh I bet this is distorting my vision and then

10:39.620 --> 10:44.060
you see what you do you cycle back and forth between meditation and

10:44.060 --> 10:48.180
contemplation one of my criticisms of how the West is appropriating or

10:48.180 --> 10:53.500
misappropriating mindfulness traditions is they tend to only concentrate on one

10:53.580 --> 10:59.100
of these typically meditation if you look at the ecology of practices what in

10:59.100 --> 11:02.940
cultures where the mindful these mindfulness practices are more

11:02.940 --> 11:06.700
indigenous what you find is people have a whole set of practices they have

11:06.700 --> 11:11.620
meditative practices contemplative practices moving practices and

11:11.620 --> 11:15.580
interpersonal social practices because you need to be cultivating them all

11:15.580 --> 11:20.740
together because they act like checks and balances on each other

11:21.180 --> 11:26.740
that's great I want to step back a bit and talk about the state of the world

11:26.740 --> 11:32.220
right now so we can for sure cover why this is important so we all know we're

11:32.220 --> 11:36.780
living in an interesting time it seems cordial but it's stressful it can be

11:36.780 --> 11:40.900
stressful people are on edge there's a lot going on you can see that with

11:40.900 --> 11:49.860
suicide rates last couple of years and I was wondering

11:50.660 --> 11:58.180
a leading question why you think the reason for that is so in science you

11:58.180 --> 12:01.700
you find things that seem disconnected and you do what's called an inference

12:01.700 --> 12:05.820
to the best explanation you try and come up with the best explanation for all of

12:05.820 --> 12:09.180
these disconnected things that unites them together that's how you afford

12:09.180 --> 12:13.940
understanding so I have a proposal in that sense I think it's a theory that's

12:13.940 --> 12:19.580
born out by evidence that a lot of these that you can see a lot of what I call

12:19.620 --> 12:24.300
symptoms almost like the way a doctor looks at various things and through

12:24.300 --> 12:28.380
them sees an underlying disease I call them symptoms of the meeting crisis this

12:28.380 --> 12:34.380
goes to work I did with Christopher Mastipriaccio Philip Misovic and the

12:34.380 --> 12:45.500
idea is that you can see a lot of markers of distress as negative symptoms

12:45.500 --> 12:48.940
you can also see a lot of markers of positive response and you can give a

12:48.940 --> 12:53.020
unified explanation of this in terms of how people are responding to the

12:53.020 --> 12:57.660
meeting crisis either in a malfunction a way or in a functional way so as you

12:57.660 --> 13:03.460
already mentioned you know suicide especially among the younger generations

13:03.460 --> 13:07.980
and going out child suicide is now becoming an issue which is a that's a

13:07.980 --> 13:12.460
profound marker that something's going wrong interestingly Tatiana

13:12.500 --> 13:18.820
shell has Chanel has got provided good evidence that there's a direct line

13:18.820 --> 13:22.180
between a sense of loss of meaning and suicide that doesn't have to pass through

13:22.180 --> 13:26.540
clinical depression so we used to think people are clinically depressed and they

13:26.540 --> 13:30.780
sort of sense meaninglessness or meaninglessness try triggers clinical

13:30.780 --> 13:35.020
depression and that leads to suicide but it looks like no people can go directly

13:35.020 --> 13:40.420
from the sense of meaninglessness into suicide there was a survey in Great

13:40.460 --> 13:45.060
Britain I think it was 2017 something like 89% of the adult survey thought

13:45.060 --> 13:50.740
their lives were meaningless and there's overwhelming evidence that that is

13:50.740 --> 13:55.020
predictive of a lot of things going wrong the survey also showed another

13:55.020 --> 13:59.260
symptom of the meaning crisis a loneliness epidemic right as you

13:59.260 --> 14:04.820
mentioned a mental health epidemic we're getting you know rise mark you know rise

14:05.580 --> 14:10.660
we're getting an increase in the markers for depression measurements of

14:10.660 --> 14:15.980
depression anxiety disorders related we're getting various addiction crises

14:15.980 --> 14:22.060
the opioid crisis so these are all markers of this meaning crisis you get

14:22.060 --> 14:29.180
the the rise it's funny I was actually interviewed by rebel wisdom just at the

14:29.220 --> 14:35.060
beginning of COVID and I was predicting a rise in what Jules Evans calls he

14:35.060 --> 14:39.420
resurrected the term conspirituality which is a mixture of conspiracy theories

14:39.420 --> 14:45.420
and spirituality practices like QAnon and things like that and you see that as

14:45.420 --> 14:52.740
another marker but you also see some positive responses you see the rise

15:00.020 --> 15:03.740
of and we've talked about it already although I have some criticisms of it

15:03.740 --> 15:08.460
but you see the rise of the mindfulness movement as an attempt to respond to that

15:08.460 --> 15:14.660
you see the rise of Hellenistic philosophies like stoicism is going

15:14.660 --> 15:20.140
through this huge revival that you see the attempts to import Buddhism and

15:20.140 --> 15:27.500
stoicism Buddhism and Taoism into the West in order and you see the emergence

15:27.780 --> 15:32.460
and I get to be involved with these people of new communities Rafe Kelly's

15:32.460 --> 15:36.540
evolved move play where people are integrated he does where he takes

15:36.540 --> 15:41.700
people out into the woods and they do parkour right and then they do mindfulness

15:41.700 --> 15:45.660
and they do martial arts and then they do campfire discourse where people are

15:45.660 --> 15:50.540
doing all of this to try and enhance meaning in life so this whole like that

15:50.540 --> 15:54.540
would look sort of chaotic and disparate but if you pause it that all of this can

15:54.580 --> 16:00.740
be seen as a response to a profound sense of loss of meaning or meaning being

16:00.740 --> 16:04.820
under threat meaning in life then you can explain all of those in terms of this

16:04.820 --> 16:11.140
idea of the meaning crisis and so I would suggest that the reason why a lot of

16:11.140 --> 16:16.940
people are under stress right now and pursuing various strategies to try and

16:16.940 --> 16:20.620
intensify meaning is exactly that meaning crisis

16:25.300 --> 16:31.220
well I did 25 hours of lecture on the awakening for the meaning crisis to try

16:31.220 --> 16:36.420
and give an answer to that question so I will do my best to try and collapse that

16:36.420 --> 16:43.260
into a couple of minutes of a response there's two basic dimensions to

16:43.260 --> 16:47.340
answering a question that are really important one is a structural dimension

16:47.340 --> 16:51.460
what is meaning what are we talking about and why does it come under threat

16:51.460 --> 16:56.140
why is it at risk and then the second is a historical so let me talk about the

16:56.140 --> 17:00.420
first because I need the first to explain the second so here's the basic idea

17:00.420 --> 17:06.100
and this is this this for me is this is where I'm placing all my epistemic and

17:06.100 --> 17:12.020
career bets because for me this is this is the lich pin which is the centrality

17:12.020 --> 17:21.100
of meaning so it goes like this you are a cognitive agent you can move in many

17:21.140 --> 17:25.540
domains and solve many problems within many domains you're really really

17:25.540 --> 17:28.820
interesting and I don't mean to make you sound like a specimen but I find that

17:28.820 --> 17:34.660
so fascinating about human beings that they have this capacity and what's what

17:34.660 --> 17:38.100
that what seems to be I would argue and what I published on at the core of this

17:38.100 --> 17:43.900
is this really unique ability we have and which and why it strikes me is so

17:43.900 --> 17:47.700
unique it's the thing we're trying to give artificial intelligence and we

17:47.740 --> 17:50.980
haven't figured out how to do it and we're this is this is the although we're

17:50.980 --> 17:55.220
making progress so I want you to notice that you're doing it right now and it

17:55.220 --> 17:58.420
goes back to that salience landscaping I was talking about so the amount of

17:58.420 --> 18:02.060
information that's actually available to you in the technical definition of

18:02.060 --> 18:08.220
information is combinatorial explosive it's astronomically vast do you know

18:08.220 --> 18:11.220
the amount of information you have in your long-term memory all the possible

18:11.220 --> 18:16.100
combinations connections you could make astronomically vast you know all the

18:16.100 --> 18:21.500
sequences of behavior you could put together astronomically vast but you

18:21.500 --> 18:25.060
know what you're doing right now out of all of the information out there all the

18:25.060 --> 18:28.780
information in here and all the possibilities of how you could behave

18:28.780 --> 18:36.180
you're zeroing in on the relevant information like that like that how do

18:36.180 --> 18:41.620
you do it it's a really hard question I dedicated my life to trying to figure it

18:41.620 --> 18:47.620
out now think about how you need that moment by moment by moment and no

18:47.620 --> 18:50.780
one has said it's not static you're constantly shifting and notice what's

18:50.780 --> 18:55.260
going on even right and this gives you a bit of a clue I would argue as to how

18:55.260 --> 18:59.980
you're doing it part of your mind is trying to select and focus in and part

18:59.980 --> 19:03.540
of your mind wants to wander off and think about other things and so part of

19:03.540 --> 19:07.420
your mind is trying to open up possibilities and then another part is

19:07.460 --> 19:11.260
selecting from all those possibilities right and it's doing this and that's

19:11.260 --> 19:15.460
just like the process of evolution you have variation and selection variation

19:15.460 --> 19:19.580
and selection so notice what that does it makes certain things about me and what

19:19.580 --> 19:24.620
I'm saying stand out and other things you don't even consider them now that's

19:24.620 --> 19:29.340
that's what's so cool this sounds like a Zen coin you know what makes you

19:29.340 --> 19:33.660
intelligent your ability to ignore most of the information that's available to

19:33.660 --> 19:38.540
you so what you're doing and this is a very technical sense is you're

19:38.540 --> 19:44.460
biasing your attention that's how you're intelligent but you pay a price for

19:44.460 --> 19:51.300
that you're biasing your attention and there's check there's are you're always

19:51.300 --> 19:56.940
always subject to this vulnerability that that bias is going to turn out to be a

19:56.940 --> 20:01.580
prejudice that you actually missed the information you needed every year until

20:01.580 --> 20:05.420
very recently because phones have made this go down but until the advent of

20:05.420 --> 20:09.860
cell phones this would regularly happen people would go into a dark place where

20:09.860 --> 20:13.300
they knew there was flammable gas dispersed and they knew they needed light

20:13.300 --> 20:16.940
so they would strike a match and what were they focusing on what was relevant

20:16.940 --> 20:20.900
to them is that the match is a source of light and what they ignored was a match

20:20.900 --> 20:26.780
is also a source of heat and they would blow themselves up right so we are

20:26.780 --> 20:32.860
always sub so the very processes these evolving dynamic processes that make us

20:32.860 --> 20:39.620
intelligent also make us perpetually susceptible to self-deception self

20:39.620 --> 20:43.660
destructive self-deception and we're doing it all the time a great place

20:43.660 --> 20:48.340
people realize this is in the romantic lives I say oh I know what I did wrong

20:48.340 --> 20:51.300
there I'm gonna do the exact opposite with this person and then they get into

20:51.300 --> 20:55.860
it and they go oh I'm doing it again I'm doing the same thing again although it's

20:55.900 --> 21:01.260
very hard for them to see it from the inside so across cultures across

21:01.260 --> 21:08.460
historical context people have developed ecologies of practices for interacting

21:08.460 --> 21:14.220
with this dynamic self-evolving relevance realization in order to try and

21:14.220 --> 21:18.780
ameliorate the foolishness that self-deceptive self-destructive behavior

21:18.780 --> 21:25.540
but there's a positive side because this is so central to you when people talk

21:25.580 --> 21:29.060
about feeling connected that's what they're talking about they're talking

21:29.060 --> 21:32.580
about that relevance realization it's relevant to me it's salient to me it

21:32.580 --> 21:37.060
draws me in relevance is always about what you're caring about as opposed to

21:37.060 --> 21:41.460
what you're ignoring and so people also not only do they need to ameliorate the

21:41.460 --> 21:45.940
foolishness they want to enhance the connectedness so they also have

21:45.940 --> 21:50.580
ecologies of practices that not only ameliorate the foolishness but enhance

21:50.580 --> 21:54.620
the connectedness that connectedness is what meaning in life is

21:54.620 --> 22:00.660
ameliorating foolishness enhancing connectedness enhancing meaning in life

22:00.660 --> 22:05.940
that's wisdom this is what I do with my students so that's the structural

22:05.940 --> 22:11.380
problem we need wisdom it's not optional for us to ignore it right and if you ask

22:11.380 --> 22:16.460
people do you want to be wiser they usually say well yeah of course do you

22:16.460 --> 22:19.900
want more meaning yeah do you want to be less self-deceptive self-destructive

22:19.900 --> 22:24.380
yeah but I'll ask my students I'll say where do you go for information oh

22:24.380 --> 22:28.420
social media the internet where do you go for knowledge a little bit slower

22:28.420 --> 22:34.700
science the universities then I'll say where do you go for wisdom and there's

22:34.700 --> 22:41.340
a silence some of them a little bit a shrinking minority will say maybe my

22:41.380 --> 22:46.780
religion but they're not very confident about that and that is the historical

22:46.780 --> 22:52.660
issue these ecologies of practices in which we cultivate wisdom have to be

22:52.660 --> 22:57.260
situated into a worldview that homes them that valorizes them that provides

22:57.260 --> 23:02.020
institutions and communities when I asked you what would you do you said I'd

23:02.020 --> 23:06.140
ask somebody if there was gunk on my glasses somebody else that's right we

23:06.140 --> 23:10.900
need a community transformation requires community it requires and a community

23:10.940 --> 23:14.980
requires a shared worldview and it requires right so you got a shared

23:14.980 --> 23:19.260
worldview a community an ecology of practices that's what religion provided

23:19.260 --> 23:27.820
and what we see historically for a lot of reasons is that is the decline the

23:27.820 --> 23:33.180
loss of what Peter Burger calls our sacred canopy I'm not advocating for

23:33.180 --> 23:38.540
Christianity I'm not doing that but what I'm saying is when we lost it for what

23:38.540 --> 23:43.620
the political and metaphysical and scientific reasons that we lost it we

23:43.620 --> 23:48.020
lost all of the functionality it provided for us in the cultivation of

23:48.020 --> 23:53.460
wisdom and meaning and here's the problem for us the scientific worldview and

23:53.460 --> 23:57.820
let's let I want you to remember I'm a scientist I love science but the

23:57.820 --> 24:05.660
scientific worldview can't address that problem and here's here's what I mean the

24:05.660 --> 24:10.580
scientific worldview has no explanation for science itself or for the

24:10.580 --> 24:15.660
meaning-making practices of the scientists that make science possible we

24:15.660 --> 24:22.180
and our science don't actually fit in to the scientific worldview we're a whole a

24:22.180 --> 24:28.300
gap but like a black hole within that worldview and so the very thing that is

24:28.300 --> 24:34.460
so successful so beautifully successful in so many domains is precisely

24:34.460 --> 24:44.300
incapable of addressing this historical loss of a worldview that homes wisdom

24:44.300 --> 24:48.860
and meaning I'm glad you brought that up because I did want to ask you being a part

24:48.860 --> 24:55.140
of the scientific community can mimic a spiritual community it seems like there

24:55.140 --> 25:01.980
is a religion of science happening also there can be and then there even been

25:02.020 --> 25:10.500
historical attempts like Auguste Comte to try and do that and there are I mean

25:10.500 --> 25:14.820
one of the things you see in the history of the West is as Christianity

25:14.820 --> 25:19.900
receded you get you get the attempt to fill in that vacuum with pseudo-religious

25:19.900 --> 25:25.340
ideologies political movements you know I would recommend very strongly that

25:25.340 --> 25:30.100
people consider that communism and Nazism are not just political phenomena

25:30.140 --> 25:35.620
they're also pseudo-religious phenomena in a profound way and so I mean and

25:35.620 --> 25:39.260
there's various ideologies left and right that people use and you can see

25:39.260 --> 25:44.220
various academic communities trying to plug in the sense of the sacred into

25:44.220 --> 25:48.820
the science by sort of fusing you know a particular political worldview

25:48.820 --> 25:54.940
liberalism or leftism or right right wingism whatever right to try and do

25:54.940 --> 26:00.780
that because science per se can't do that the attempt to turn science into

26:00.780 --> 26:07.300
religious framework with some people called scientism you see it happening

26:07.300 --> 26:11.260
with the with the academic community but on on its own science really can't do

26:11.260 --> 26:16.740
that much so it's usually glued together with a not scientifically based

26:16.740 --> 26:24.460
allegiance to a particular socio-political economic ideological vision of what the

26:24.460 --> 26:28.940
good life is and what good people are and what's the good what's the good

26:28.940 --> 26:33.940
future that we should be pursuing and things like that so we're talking about

26:33.940 --> 26:37.780
science and spirituality and one of your passions for bringing them closer

26:37.780 --> 26:42.260
together one of the things you'd mentioned on your first episode of your

26:42.260 --> 26:47.500
series is the different types of knowing and yeah for me like I think people

26:47.500 --> 26:50.980
need to know about that would you mind going through thank you for bringing that

26:51.020 --> 26:56.380
up because that that goes exactly towards the kind of bridging that's a

26:56.380 --> 27:04.540
wonderful question I deeply appreciate that and it's it's funny you're and I

27:04.540 --> 27:11.020
don't mean this in any way to denigrate my my two boys who are like the jewels

27:11.020 --> 27:15.140
of my life but your theories are kind of like your children and you don't know

27:15.140 --> 27:18.540
which and you when you don't know which one of these is going to take off and

27:18.580 --> 27:22.060
it's really interesting that this has been something that really that people

27:22.060 --> 27:26.700
have found very central so the idea is and this is one of the ways in which

27:26.700 --> 27:32.860
science is inadequate the idea is that there's four kinds of knowing and let's

27:32.860 --> 27:36.420
start with the one that's typified in science and that's prevalent in our

27:36.420 --> 27:40.540
culture especially in ideological movements which is propositional knowing

27:40.540 --> 27:47.100
so this is knowing that you you practice you practice this knowing by

27:47.100 --> 27:51.460
asserting propositions you say things like I believe that the earth is round

27:51.460 --> 27:57.660
that's a proposition and I believe it and what I do is I gather evidence for

27:57.660 --> 28:01.580
that particular proposition and if the evidence is enough I start to talk about

28:01.580 --> 28:04.740
and it gives me explanatory power I start talking about a theory and I get a

28:04.740 --> 28:08.980
sense of a conviction a sense of conviction that it's true and of course

28:08.980 --> 28:13.420
ideologies make those same kinds of moves that's propositional knowing and for a

28:13.700 --> 28:18.420
very long time because of the scientific revolution and Descartes and because also

28:18.420 --> 28:22.980
of things going on in the Protestant Reformation we have started to think

28:22.980 --> 28:27.580
that that's all knowing is just propositional knowing and we've done

28:27.580 --> 28:31.420
we've done similar reductions we've reduced faith to belief we treat them

28:31.420 --> 28:34.540
as if they're synonyms and we think that the most important thing for

28:34.540 --> 28:38.940
explaining somebody's behavior are their beliefs and so we get this massive

28:38.940 --> 28:44.540
reduction now what's happened in the cognitive science that I'm privileged

28:44.540 --> 28:50.060
to participate in there's been a revolution going on in the last you

28:50.060 --> 28:53.820
know 30 40 years it's called for e-cognitive science we can get into

28:53.820 --> 28:59.940
that at some point if you want but the main idea is I draw from that is that

28:59.940 --> 29:04.860
there are other kinds of knowing so there's procedural which isn't knowing

29:04.860 --> 29:08.500
that something is it the case it's knowing how to do something it's knowing

29:08.500 --> 29:13.020
how to catch a ball it's knowing how to kiss somebody right which isn't the same

29:13.020 --> 29:18.020
thing as having a bunch of beliefs about kissing that's why you could read a lot

29:18.020 --> 29:20.980
of books on kissing and it wouldn't make you a good kisser wouldn't make you a

29:20.980 --> 29:26.300
good martial artist it can help but it's not it's nowhere near enough knowing

29:26.300 --> 29:30.140
how has a lot more to do not with theories it has to do with skills about

29:30.140 --> 29:35.180
how to right build up sensory motor patterns of interaction with the world

29:35.220 --> 29:38.980
and and the sense of realness there isn't the sense of truth it's a sense of

29:38.980 --> 29:43.940
power like when you have a skill you have expertise and that's why you give

29:43.940 --> 29:47.860
authority to a doctor because they have a sense of skills obviously they have

29:47.860 --> 29:50.740
beliefs but if they had the beliefs without the skills would you go to the

29:50.740 --> 29:55.620
doctor no way right so that's procedural knowing it's knowing how

29:55.620 --> 29:59.780
interestingly the forms of memory associated with the two kinds of

29:59.780 --> 30:04.060
knowing are distinct your semantic memory your memory of facts is distinct

30:04.100 --> 30:07.300
from your procedural memory your knowledge of skills so you can lose one

30:07.300 --> 30:14.380
without losing the other so now related to that is another one which is think of

30:14.380 --> 30:19.780
what you need for your skills you need what's called situational awareness so

30:19.780 --> 30:23.060
is your skill of swimming relevant right now should you activate it should you

30:23.060 --> 30:28.300
get you start swim now because it's not relevant here I mean if the room

30:28.300 --> 30:32.940
suddenly flooded with water it could be so you need situational awareness to

30:32.940 --> 30:38.180
tell you which skills to activate which skills you might need to acquire right

30:38.180 --> 30:43.060
so what's the situational awareness what kind of knowing is that well this is

30:43.060 --> 30:47.380
knowing what it's like to be here right now the here nowness so this is member I

30:47.380 --> 30:52.500
mentioned it this is your knowing by salience landscaping how are you salience

30:52.500 --> 30:56.980
landscaping how are you sizing up this situation right what's your state of mind

30:56.980 --> 31:01.700
right so you have this this episodic memory which is a combination of your

31:01.700 --> 31:04.900
state of mind in this situation so think of the difference in your memory

31:04.900 --> 31:08.300
between remembering that two plus two equals four and your memory of your

31:08.300 --> 31:14.980
last birthday one is just this fact that just hangs out the other is you recall

31:14.980 --> 31:19.780
the situation a scene what stands out what's foregrounded what's backgrounded

31:19.780 --> 31:23.980
and you recall your corresponding and co-determining state of mind so you

31:23.980 --> 31:29.620
recall your perspective this is perspectival knowing now its sense of

31:29.620 --> 31:34.660
realness isn't the conviction of truth or power we know what it is because and I

31:34.660 --> 31:38.620
do work on this just published some papers on it with Dan Schiappi right in

31:38.620 --> 31:42.620
terms of virtual reality so what are people looking for that they want the

31:42.620 --> 31:47.420
game to be real what are they looking for it's called a sense of presence so

31:47.420 --> 31:50.620
that perspectival knowing gives you a sense of realness when you have a sense

31:50.620 --> 31:56.380
that you're really here really now really connected really present it's a sense of

31:56.380 --> 32:03.220
presence as a realness okay what's under that what's under that is you don't come

32:03.220 --> 32:07.780
into this situation as a blank slate contrary to what John Locke said you

32:07.780 --> 32:12.460
come in with your biology your biological evolutionary heritage and your

32:12.460 --> 32:17.020
culture shaping you and the environment to fit each other this chair is

32:17.020 --> 32:20.980
suitable for me I can sit on it that's an affordance it affords sitting it

32:20.980 --> 32:25.180
wouldn't afford sitting for an elephant right this glass this glass is

32:25.180 --> 32:30.020
graspable by me evolution has shaped me to pick up objects like this and then

32:30.020 --> 32:34.620
culture has taught me to shape my hand this way and and made objects that fit

32:34.620 --> 32:40.100
my hand so this if this for me this is graspable the graspability is not in the

32:40.100 --> 32:44.380
glass it's not in my hand but in the way my hand and the glass have been shaped

32:44.380 --> 32:49.820
to each other by evolution and by culture and by my ongoing state of mind

32:49.820 --> 32:54.580
this is an idea from Gibson and it's at the core of 40 cognitive science right

32:55.140 --> 33:01.620
that you have right the way though you and your environment are co-shaping each

33:01.620 --> 33:06.260
other and opening up a whole network of affordances that are available to you

33:06.260 --> 33:10.460
for interacting with the world this is your participatory knowing this is your

33:10.460 --> 33:14.860
knowing by being this is the relationship between your agency and how the world is

33:14.860 --> 33:20.620
disclosed to you as an arena for action and they're mutually belonging together

33:20.900 --> 33:26.100
now you have semantic memory for propositional knowing you have procedural

33:26.100 --> 33:29.740
memory right for procedural knowing you have episodic memory for

33:29.740 --> 33:34.020
perspective knowing what kind of memory do you have for this participatory

33:34.020 --> 33:39.860
belonging in the world a profound kind of memory you call yourself your sense

33:39.860 --> 33:45.140
of self your sense of identity this is the deep kind of memory a deep kind of

33:45.140 --> 33:50.780
knowing so when you know something by binding yourself to it perhaps the way

33:50.780 --> 33:55.580
you should know your partner right so your self-knowledge and your knowledge

33:55.580 --> 34:00.620
of your partner are bound up together and they co-evolve and they shape each

34:00.620 --> 34:06.700
other right and the two people right more and more conform to each other and

34:06.700 --> 34:13.220
afford each other's transformation so you know love is the the medieval's had

34:13.220 --> 34:16.620
this that love is its own way of knowing love is a primary example of

34:16.620 --> 34:20.180
participatory knowing the kind of knowing that you can only have by loving

34:20.180 --> 34:26.260
something right so the participatory knowing sets out the affordances the

34:26.260 --> 34:30.220
perspective of knowing makes certain affordances salient and stand out so

34:30.220 --> 34:33.620
it and then that activates what skills you're going to bring into the

34:33.620 --> 34:37.020
interaction and then as you're interacting you bring out the facts

34:37.020 --> 34:42.020
that are relevant to your interaction and that's how they all work so the

34:42.020 --> 34:46.380
scientific worldview locks us here in the propositional and most of that

34:46.380 --> 34:51.580
relevance realization that connectedness is happening on at the levels of the

34:51.580 --> 34:56.060
non propositional knowing this is another profound reason why science

34:56.060 --> 35:01.900
qua science can't give us the meaning now what science can do is give us the

35:01.900 --> 35:06.140
science of those kinds of knowing so that we can better engineer the

35:06.140 --> 35:11.420
psychotechnologies the practices that will enhance them that will make them

35:11.420 --> 35:18.860
wiser and more meaningful enhance that connectedness so this is taking me to

35:18.860 --> 35:23.300
altered states of consciousness I would love to talk about that of course you

35:23.300 --> 35:31.700
should I think that so many of us are stuck focusing on the wrong things or

35:31.700 --> 35:38.620
just at least very narrow things on our TV screens social media and the few

35:38.620 --> 35:46.220
people that we have in our very small circles now how do you feel that how do

35:46.220 --> 35:49.420
you feel altered states of consciousness fall into helping us with this

35:49.420 --> 35:55.260
meaning so that is also a really profound question and I would I would

35:55.260 --> 35:59.700
suggest to you that the renaissance of interest in psychedelics both

35:59.700 --> 36:04.580
academically and culturally is another symptomatic response to the meaning

36:04.580 --> 36:11.140
crisis people are craving enhanced connectedness the kind of union and

36:11.140 --> 36:16.540
self-transcendence and as you said they're trying to break out of too narrow

36:16.540 --> 36:21.020
of framing on reality and that's why they're seeking them out and of course

36:21.020 --> 36:24.980
there's been a you know cross cultures cross history a long-standing

36:24.980 --> 36:29.980
connection between psychedelics and mystical experience so they're not the

36:29.980 --> 36:37.580
same but and and the cultivation of wisdom so we have to be very cautious

36:37.580 --> 36:45.820
about this because we have the very thing that the very reason why people and

36:45.820 --> 36:51.180
this is almost ironic the very reason why people might take psychedelics is the

36:51.180 --> 36:56.500
kind of misframing they could bring to the psychedelics which is they could get

36:56.540 --> 37:06.140
too focused and too narrow a framing of this psychedelic experience so altered

37:06.140 --> 37:09.340
states of consciousness psychedelic experience mystical experience one of

37:09.340 --> 37:15.820
the ways of thinking about them one of the ways I've been arguing up with lots

37:15.820 --> 37:19.980
of people like Dana Craig and others we've been working on this idea Jensen

37:19.980 --> 37:28.980
Kim a bunch of people is I want you to remember an experience that probably

37:28.980 --> 37:35.060
happens to you every day and I want to use that and put it on a continuum with

37:35.060 --> 37:41.140
altered states so you've had an aha moment can you remember one recently

37:41.140 --> 37:46.380
where you realized oh I'm looking at this in completely the wrong way at that

37:46.380 --> 37:50.820
aha experience where you've been thinking about something you're right I

37:50.820 --> 37:54.660
should think about it this way I was the wrong I was concentrating on the wrong

37:54.660 --> 37:57.940
thing the fact that you asked me that question means you've had that experience

37:57.940 --> 38:02.460
so I study this I study is called insight and notice what it means to see

38:02.460 --> 38:08.380
a to see into something right so what's happening in an insight experience notice

38:08.380 --> 38:13.420
that we often talk about it like a flash of insight what's happening is your

38:13.460 --> 38:18.260
salience landscape is suddenly shifting often they'll represented in movies with

38:18.260 --> 38:21.780
things coming in and out of the foreground of the background right so

38:21.780 --> 38:26.780
what's happening is a very dynamic reconfiguration of your salience

38:26.780 --> 38:33.140
landscape right so you ask people well what grows from an acorn and oak what's

38:33.140 --> 38:39.420
this stroke what's the gray stuff that comes off fire smoke what's the white of

38:39.420 --> 38:46.260
an egg called and people say the yolk and you were gonna say right but the

38:46.260 --> 38:50.260
answer is the white of the egg but what were you doing you were concentrating on

38:50.260 --> 38:54.540
the oak sound you foregrounded that as relevant and then so you looked for the

38:54.540 --> 38:59.300
part of the egg that has the oak sound in it you said yolk and then you laughed

38:59.300 --> 39:02.820
because humor is related to insight because you realized that you had

39:03.140 --> 39:11.260
misframed the situation okay now we are doing that all the time because like I

39:11.260 --> 39:15.860
said the relevance realization process is constantly evolving and sometimes

39:15.860 --> 39:20.980
though that evolution goes through this dynamic shift of self-correction this is

39:20.980 --> 39:25.820
why insight is so associated with wisdom if you ask people could somebody be not

39:25.820 --> 39:29.460
that educated but really wise they go yeah I think so what if they weren't very

39:29.500 --> 39:33.820
artistic could they be wise yeah I think so could they be not very insightful and

39:33.820 --> 39:37.860
wise they go no they got to be insightful to be wise there's a deep

39:37.860 --> 39:42.820
connection there because they realize that insight is a little micro moment of

39:42.820 --> 39:47.060
increased wisdom it's a little moment of self-transcendence it's a little moment

39:47.060 --> 39:50.060
when you're breaking out of that narrow frame and you've got a moment when you

39:50.060 --> 39:54.100
realized oh I was looking at it the wrong way now what I want you to consider is

39:54.260 --> 40:00.340
that capacity for self-transcendence self-correction right and it comes with a

40:00.340 --> 40:05.300
change in consciousness there's a flash it's on a continuum so if you get a

40:05.300 --> 40:08.620
bunch of these insights at least that's what I published with Leo Ferrero and

40:08.620 --> 40:13.260
Erin Herobinat in 2018 and you start chaining them together so an insight

40:13.260 --> 40:16.300
leads to another insight leads to another insight like think about somebody

40:16.300 --> 40:19.380
playing jazz they're playing jazz and they pick up and they break frame and

40:19.380 --> 40:22.300
make a new frame and then they have to break the frame and make and they're

40:22.300 --> 40:26.500
constantly they get into what's called the flow state athletes seek this out

40:26.500 --> 40:28.900
because it's optimal you're at your very best and it feels like the most

40:28.900 --> 40:33.300
amazing experience like in your act right so you're in the zone and I get it

40:33.300 --> 40:36.580
like as a martial artist I get it when I'm lecturing and notice what people say

40:36.580 --> 40:42.100
it's like they now talk about the whole world being super salient they feel that

40:42.100 --> 40:46.620
one with their environment they feel deeply connected that's that enhanced

40:46.620 --> 40:50.860
meaning right and flow states is when they start to feel like they're they

40:50.940 --> 40:55.100
have that really deep connectedness but they're self-transcending they report a

40:55.100 --> 40:59.180
loss of self-consciousness my consciousness you know that mattering

40:59.180 --> 41:04.420
narrative nanny in your head how do I look how are people thinking of me what's

41:04.420 --> 41:09.940
going on do they like me all of that all of that goes away because they're so at

41:09.940 --> 41:12.660
one and like when you're a martial artist like if you're sparring in your

41:12.660 --> 41:17.420
in your flow like it's so amazing you know at one level you're making all this

41:17.460 --> 41:21.660
effort but your hand just goes for the block and you just find the opening for

41:21.660 --> 41:28.220
the punch right or right or it's so that's the flow state notice how that's

41:28.220 --> 41:31.900
already a profound altered state of consciousness now one of the interesting

41:31.900 --> 41:36.140
features about flow Chikset Mahai has studied this for decades is it's a

41:36.140 --> 41:41.780
universal it happens to people regardless of their gender their socio-economic

41:41.780 --> 41:47.820
status their language their cultural background across all of this people

41:47.820 --> 41:52.060
describe the flow experience in almost the same light the same terms of the

41:52.060 --> 41:56.780
same level of detail so it's something profound going on because it's enhancing

41:56.780 --> 42:01.700
right this this relevance realization this connectedness this capacity for

42:01.700 --> 42:07.460
self-transcendence now take flow and its altered state of consciousness and ramp

42:07.580 --> 42:13.140
it up instead of flowing as I'm sparring right or as I'm writing poetry or as I'm

42:13.140 --> 42:20.180
playing jazz what have I flowed at the level of my grant my relationship to

42:20.180 --> 42:24.980
reality as a whole what have I got into a flow state at the level of my world

42:24.980 --> 42:31.500
view so I was doing what Blake said I was seeing a world in a grain of sand

42:31.500 --> 42:35.300
that everything is interpenetrating and I'm getting this flow that's from the

42:35.300 --> 42:39.860
gestalt to the feature and in and out to the center of my psyche out to the

42:39.860 --> 42:44.180
depths of the world as a flow experience and imagine how that's going to

42:44.180 --> 42:49.580
transform your salience landscaping and how it's going to even more reduce that

42:49.580 --> 42:54.380
that self-consciousness it's going to be like a super awe experience those are

42:54.380 --> 42:58.020
mystical experiences and then there's an overlap between psychedelic

42:58.020 --> 43:02.020
experiences and even lion I just I interviewed him from my one of my

43:02.020 --> 43:05.140
channels he's writing a book it's coming out called psychedelic experience

43:05.140 --> 43:08.820
and he points out that psychedelic experiences don't have to use substances

43:08.820 --> 43:12.900
there's other ways of triggering them and so you got you so you got insight

43:12.900 --> 43:18.180
flow psychedelic experiences mystical experiences and then when mystical

43:18.180 --> 43:24.180
experiences put people in touch with what they call the really real the most

43:24.180 --> 43:32.360
real this is what's so fascinating about it they will transform their lives their

43:32.360 --> 43:38.460
roles their relationships often their occupation in order to conform more and

43:38.460 --> 43:43.540
more to that really real they'll invert everything so normally what we do is the

43:43.540 --> 43:47.580
everyday is the real and anything that's off that's aberrant from that like a

43:47.580 --> 43:52.340
dream or when we're drunk we go that's not real people do the opposite in these

43:52.380 --> 43:56.180
experience they have these experiences the real really real and they say that's

43:56.180 --> 44:02.180
real and all of this is less real and they change their lives because we want

44:02.180 --> 44:08.260
to be in touch with what's most real and so altered states of consciousness are

44:08.260 --> 44:15.500
are so sought after now because they give us the capacity for enhancing all of

44:15.500 --> 44:19.300
that continuum from insight to transformative experience giving us the

44:19.300 --> 44:25.700
self-transcendence the opportunity to get profound insight cultivate wisdom and

44:25.700 --> 44:29.580
transform our sense of self all the kinds of knowing and so of course we're

44:29.580 --> 44:37.660
seeking it but here's the danger here's the danger right if you don't have that

44:37.660 --> 44:41.780
situated within an already existing ecology of practices in which you're

44:41.780 --> 44:47.500
cultivating wisdom and a community that is giving you a worldview you can spin

44:47.540 --> 44:52.660
off you can spin off from these altered states you can go down various rabbit

44:52.660 --> 44:57.340
holes you can get into echo chambers you can come up with wacky metaphysics all

44:57.340 --> 45:03.700
kinds of strange things happening so and I get into a little bit of trouble not

45:03.700 --> 45:08.260
like officially but with the university and also I think I pissed people off a

45:08.260 --> 45:13.020
little bit because I say two things and it sounds like contradiction I say we

45:13.020 --> 45:18.460
should not prohibit substances doesn't work doesn't work I'm really confident

45:18.460 --> 45:22.980
about that doesn't work okay but we should also license the use of them like

45:22.980 --> 45:28.060
we do for a car or a handgun these are powerful tools you don't give a five

45:28.060 --> 45:31.500
year old a chainsaw you don't give somebody in fact who doesn't know how to

45:31.500 --> 45:35.940
use a chainsaw a chainsaw if you're gonna cut through the cords of your life

45:35.940 --> 45:38.900
because you're seeking profound transformation you better know how to

45:38.900 --> 45:43.420
use that tool right it's called the mind sword in you know in some of the

45:43.420 --> 45:47.020
Buddhist traditions you know you better learn like and that's what decisive

45:47.020 --> 45:50.700
means by the way it means to cut right if you if you don't know how to wield

45:50.700 --> 45:56.020
that properly there's a potential for getting into some very significant

45:56.020 --> 46:02.900
self-deceptive self-destructive behavior so I think that if we're cultivating

46:02.900 --> 46:06.460
altered states of consciousness through mindfulness practices through movement

46:06.500 --> 46:10.860
practices through group practices through the use of substances through

46:10.860 --> 46:15.900
breathing techniques that should always be properly situated within a

46:15.900 --> 46:23.340
sapiential sacred community I can see the problem with that argument where many

46:23.340 --> 46:28.340
things that are licensed start to become really rigid so I'd imagine that the

46:28.340 --> 46:34.100
whole licensing process of this look very different than anything else I mean

46:34.100 --> 46:39.300
we talk about doulas for example yeah licensing at least in the US for a long

46:39.300 --> 46:45.620
time because of that yes about the person and how can you license or restrict

46:45.620 --> 46:50.100
how that process goes for each human well we do it for other things so here's my

46:50.100 --> 46:55.220
counter example and you know this has become you know the case and there was

46:55.220 --> 46:59.380
this discussion around it but we do it with psychotherapy we like it's now the

46:59.380 --> 47:04.180
law that you can't practice psychotherapy unless you are approved by the

47:04.180 --> 47:08.680
college and the idea here is because we're engaging in something that has the

47:08.680 --> 47:13.780
capacity to you know radically transform people and therefore there is a power

47:13.780 --> 47:20.180
and we have to make sure that people have both the scientific and the skill and

47:20.180 --> 47:25.060
I would even add perhaps the moral training education so that they will

47:25.060 --> 47:30.160
wield that power responsibly thank you okay I want to back up to something about

47:30.160 --> 47:37.340
insight that it was great that you brought together the humor is human

47:37.340 --> 47:41.260
insight somehow go together yes so humor from all the people that we've

47:41.260 --> 47:46.180
interviewed so far has come up humor and martial art yes interestingly enough

47:46.180 --> 47:50.380
and it was funny I was thinking about the aha moment how it's like a aha moment

47:50.380 --> 47:55.060
yeah yeah yeah that's great I like that did you come up with that I have that's

47:55.060 --> 48:03.220
beautiful I like that so I was right you can talk a little bit more about humor

48:03.220 --> 48:11.380
and how that plays a role oh cognitive science but also very much and one of

48:11.380 --> 48:17.380
the things that intrigued me is you know the cross-cultural for study of spiritual

48:17.380 --> 48:20.920
traditions that have humor in them Zen has a lot of humor in it and others

48:20.920 --> 48:29.260
where the humor is much more much more backgrounded and held down so humor these

48:29.260 --> 48:37.180
three things are related humor metaphor and insight and and they don't come

48:37.180 --> 48:41.940
naturally to human beings we have to practice it with kids for a long time so

48:41.940 --> 48:47.740
try and get a four-year-old to tell a joke they're not very good at it try and

48:47.740 --> 48:51.500
get them to understand metaphor they're not very good at it and their insight

48:51.500 --> 48:57.660
capacity is also not that explicit to them so one of the ways of thinking about

48:57.660 --> 49:04.920
this goes to work that's been really developed well by you McGill

49:04.920 --> 49:09.700
Kristen I was privileged to have a conversation with him about but it lines

49:09.940 --> 49:16.380
up with work from Cuneas Beeman Bowden a whole bunch of people that they have a

49:16.380 --> 49:20.340
book called the Eureka factor having to do with the relationship between the

49:20.340 --> 49:28.020
hemispheres so we were talking about like your ability to solve problems and

49:28.020 --> 49:31.340
humor is actually making use of the problem-solving ability so I am getting

49:31.340 --> 49:38.580
there right now there's two kinds of problems you're facing all the time one

49:38.580 --> 49:43.260
is a problem that's very familiar to you it's very well-defined look like a

49:43.260 --> 49:47.820
prototypical example is a multiplication problem you know what kind of problem it

49:47.820 --> 49:50.740
is you know the actions you're supposed to perform you know when you're doing it

49:50.740 --> 49:53.940
right you know when it's doing wrong you know what the results supposed to look

49:53.940 --> 50:00.300
like very well-defined problem now compare solving a multiplication

50:00.300 --> 50:06.380
problem with going on a successful first date what's the rule there so what's the

50:06.420 --> 50:10.820
initial state well you're with some stranger okay what kind of problem is

50:10.820 --> 50:19.100
this well what should I do I don't know like when I was dating I remember did

50:19.100 --> 50:23.940
the advice my friends would give me was so useless was like look at her eyes but

50:23.940 --> 50:28.660
not too much laugh at her jokes but not too often try to be funny but not to ask

50:28.660 --> 50:37.380
questions but it's like right and so these are called ill-defined problems

50:37.380 --> 50:44.380
and ill-defined problems are pervasive in your environment and what your brain is

50:44.380 --> 50:47.660
really struggling to do again the framing is try and convert as many of

50:47.660 --> 50:50.540
those ill-defined problems into well-defined problems that you can

50:50.540 --> 50:56.540
build up habits and routines for right left hemisphere is about well-defined

50:56.540 --> 51:01.740
problems step-by-step narrow focus attention to detail not language that we

51:01.740 --> 51:06.140
people say languages in both hemispheres and that's stuff about drawing on the

51:06.140 --> 51:09.220
right side of your brain and you have an artist in your right hemisphere and you

51:09.220 --> 51:12.860
have some sort of fascist in your left hemisphere that's all ridiculous but the

51:12.860 --> 51:18.620
left hemisphere tends to focus on well-defined problems the right tends

51:18.620 --> 51:24.180
to focus on ill-defined problems so instead of focusing on detail it reaches

51:24.180 --> 51:28.300
for the gestalt so think of like I think of a classic ill-defined problem

51:28.300 --> 51:34.020
predator something's attacking you like you don't oh well what kind of predator

51:34.020 --> 51:38.820
is it let's get very clear you're dead right so you want to do open up you want

51:38.820 --> 51:43.420
to gestalt you it's ill-defined you want some very coarse-grained things you want

51:43.420 --> 51:47.700
to grab associations as fast as you can so what typically happens when people

51:47.700 --> 51:52.300
come into situations that are very ill-defined is you can see activity

51:52.300 --> 51:59.260
being initially predominant in the left of the right hemisphere now what happens

51:59.260 --> 52:03.180
in insight is you come to a problem and you think you know how to frame it oh

52:03.180 --> 52:07.740
yes I know how to do this the left hemisphere is very dominant and then

52:07.740 --> 52:13.860
you realize I don't know how to do this and you'll see the aha moment is when

52:13.860 --> 52:18.900
activity shifts from the left to the right and then what happens in the right

52:18.940 --> 52:24.380
is in here you're you're you're working within a frame and in here you're going

52:24.380 --> 52:28.140
all that frames don't and now you're looking for a frame and then when you

52:28.140 --> 52:31.100
get an alternative frame you bring it back you reframe your problem and that

52:31.100 --> 52:40.380
that that's aha something else that does that is metaphor metaphor also does

52:40.380 --> 52:47.620
that shift so when I say and we notice notice how much your cognition is

52:47.660 --> 52:54.140
drenched in metaphor I just did it by the way so you'll say things like we're

52:54.140 --> 52:59.540
halfway through this interview halfway way through we're not moving through

52:59.540 --> 53:05.140
space the interview I hope it's not too hard John I hope right I hope you're

53:05.140 --> 53:09.380
seeing what I'm saying I hope you're getting it I hope you're understanding

53:09.380 --> 53:15.940
it I hope you're right to see in fact try to say anything profound and

53:15.940 --> 53:20.380
meaningful to somebody without invoking a metaphor because you're trying to

53:20.380 --> 53:24.060
afford insight this is the work of lake often Johnson although I have some

53:24.060 --> 53:32.020
criticisms of the specifics of their theory okay so metaphor and insight and

53:32.020 --> 53:36.900
we use metaphor we use propositional metaphors to try and trigger non-

53:36.900 --> 53:43.780
propositional insight so and of course Shakespeare is an exemplar of this

53:43.980 --> 53:53.380
humor involves metaphor when it's verbal humor of some kind right and it

53:53.380 --> 53:58.300
involves a sudden reframing you have to get the punchline you have to have the

53:58.300 --> 54:03.420
aha moment that's why people will often retrospectively see a failure of

54:03.420 --> 54:10.980
insight as something funny they'll go oh haha so humor is it like one of the

54:10.980 --> 54:15.900
things you're doing when somebody gets a joke right is you're playing with things

54:15.900 --> 54:22.140
you know don't live leave alphabet soup on the you know boiling on the stove it

54:22.140 --> 54:29.140
could spell disaster okay it's a bad joke but but the point is notice how I'm

54:29.140 --> 54:33.020
playing right on two different meanings and moving between them and you got to

54:33.020 --> 54:36.740
shift the meaning right you got a reframe you have to have that insight and

54:36.740 --> 54:40.740
you do it retrospectively and it alleviates the tension between like

54:40.740 --> 54:44.500
there's a there's an initial problem and then you resolve it with insight and you

54:44.500 --> 54:49.460
play with sort of the metaphorical aspects of language we've got humor and

54:49.460 --> 54:53.580
then with other humor that's non-verbal we're doing sort of something

54:53.580 --> 54:58.540
analogously I would argue with like perspectival knowing things like that so

54:58.540 --> 55:05.260
humor metaphor insight are bound together and you can see why people who are

55:05.300 --> 55:10.740
seeking transformation would rely on them because they're what you're doing is

55:10.740 --> 55:16.700
you're trying to fuel and prime the engine of cognitive flexibility of your

55:16.700 --> 55:24.140
ability to reframe right and to alter what's salient and relevant to you in a

55:24.140 --> 55:28.820
way that connects to you that matters to you that's meaningful to you and of

55:28.820 --> 55:34.700
course that's going to help you take ill-defined situations like when

55:34.740 --> 55:40.100
something traumatic has happened to us or when some opportunity that's golden

55:40.100 --> 55:44.180
has suddenly opened up to us should I get involved with that person should I

55:44.180 --> 55:48.620
try that new career we're going to turn to these as a way of trying to enhance

55:48.620 --> 55:52.820
our ability to deal with ill-defined situations

55:52.820 --> 55:58.460
I need to believe so many people are resistant to taking their glasses off and

55:58.460 --> 56:09.860
seeing what's on there because I mean part of it is part of it is cultural we

56:09.860 --> 56:15.820
have truncated and reduced people's sense of their mind and their self and

56:15.820 --> 56:22.620
those aren't identical but they're related and so we people don't when

56:22.620 --> 56:27.740
people don't have the ability to access that cognitive flexibility and when

56:27.740 --> 56:31.660
they're in a meaning scarcity this is called scarcity mentality when human

56:31.660 --> 56:37.140
beings face any significant scarcity of food water of you know friendship

56:37.140 --> 56:41.940
relationship meaning they become very rigid they become very narrow they become

56:41.940 --> 56:48.700
very short-term in their thinking this is why you know sort of you know blaming

56:48.700 --> 56:52.860
people for bad behavior because they're poor is is perhaps getting things the

56:52.860 --> 56:58.380
wrong way around right instead right you think of people in scarcity so if we've

56:58.380 --> 57:02.420
taken all of the meaning and wisdom machinery away and we've really reduced

57:02.420 --> 57:06.500
people's sense of what they're what they are you are your beliefs and they're

57:06.540 --> 57:12.740
shrunk down here and they're starving of course they're going to be resistant to

57:12.740 --> 57:17.300
taking their glasses off they're going to be rigid and resistant and they're in

57:17.300 --> 57:24.380
fact they're going to double down on holding on to the beliefs with which

57:24.380 --> 57:30.140
they identify if you feel comfortable talking about this I'm not sure if this

57:30.140 --> 57:37.340
is your area of expertise so rebel wisdom yes they talk about sense-making yes

57:37.340 --> 57:44.380
sense-making and meaning making what's the relationship between them so they're

57:44.380 --> 57:48.980
they're they're they overlap to a great degree so sense-making was a term coined

57:48.980 --> 57:55.340
I think I believe by maybe it was O'Shamel but it was made prominent by

57:55.340 --> 58:00.620
Francisco Varela who is one of the pioneers of 4e cognitive science and

58:00.620 --> 58:07.020
then by my former colleague Evan Thompson who is like if you want to

58:07.020 --> 58:10.020
understand 4e cognitive science you have to look at Evan's work Evan is

58:10.020 --> 58:19.220
brilliant and profound and it was it was a loss when he left University of

58:19.220 --> 58:25.260
Toronto go to UBC so they coined this term of sense-making and the the basic

58:25.260 --> 58:34.140
idea is this that even a paramecium right is doing it's detecting its

58:34.140 --> 58:39.780
environment right and it's adapting and responding and so in its sensory motor

58:39.780 --> 58:44.860
behavior it's it is treating it's not seeing it doesn't have consciousness or

58:44.860 --> 58:54.120
everything like that but it's detecting this molecule as food food isn't part of

58:54.120 --> 58:57.780
physics like if you look in a physics textbook you won't you won't find a

58:57.780 --> 59:01.620
definition for food food is an affordance relationship between this

59:01.620 --> 59:07.180
chemical and this the autopoiesis the self-making of the paramecium the

59:07.180 --> 59:10.660
paramecium because it's constantly taking care of itself because it's a

59:10.660 --> 59:14.340
living thing it's caring about this I don't mean full blow in emotion but

59:14.340 --> 59:18.660
there's a kind of caring very small scale right there's a kind of caring of

59:18.660 --> 59:24.540
and it's also that molecule is poison so it swims away from that one and swims

59:24.540 --> 59:29.300
towards this one so it's doing sense-making it's making sense of its

59:29.300 --> 59:34.740
right of its environment now if you lift that sense-making up into what we

59:34.740 --> 59:40.220
could call kinds of knowing then the sense-making I would argue is meaning

59:40.220 --> 59:45.860
making in this time right now where people are trying to make sense of so

59:45.860 --> 59:52.700
much why do you do you feel that this is a skill that people could work to get

59:52.700 --> 59:57.700
better at I would be I'd be really strong about that I would say it's a

59:57.700 --> 01:00:04.020
necessity if you do not get better at waiting through all the bullshit and I

01:00:04.020 --> 01:00:07.580
use that in a very technical sense maybe you can ask me about that but if we do

01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:10.620
not get better and one of the other symptoms of the meeting crisis we

01:00:10.620 --> 01:00:13.940
track this in the book is people feel like bullshit and bullshitting is

01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:18.340
expanding both quantitatively there's more of it and it's in more domains and

01:00:18.340 --> 01:00:23.660
it's people are getting more and more shameless about the bullshitting which

01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:30.500
is really egregious if you don't do something about that toxicity right the

01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:38.700
way that that is radically undermining your capacity to connect to reality and

01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:43.540
exacerbating making you more and more prone to self-deceptive self-destructive

01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:50.420
behavior if you don't do anything about that given the way right social media is

01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:54.020
complexifying and with it the bullshitting is complexifying and

01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:59.100
permeating your life and percolating into the depths of the psyche and ways

01:00:59.100 --> 01:01:02.540
you're not aware of if you're watching if you're using lots of social media I

01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:07.020
will predict that you are suffering more depression and anxiety I'm confident

01:01:07.020 --> 01:01:14.100
about that if you don't do something to address and ameliorate that I strongly

01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:19.460
predict it's going to get worse for you with time and not only with you as an

01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:23.300
individual but with you and your group

01:01:23.340 --> 01:01:32.700
would you explain echo chambers sure so remember we talked about you know the

01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:38.660
way we we have to focus in and and and these are very adaptive now one of the

01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:44.660
things you do and I do too is we do what's called the confirmation bias now

01:01:44.660 --> 01:01:48.900
in a lot of environments this is adaptive so I want I want to understand

01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:52.780
that I want you to understand that but what does it mean well what does it mean

01:01:52.780 --> 01:01:58.980
is generally we don't look for information that challenges or

01:01:58.980 --> 01:02:04.140
disconfirms our belief we look for information that supports it that's

01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:09.500
confirmation bias again one more time right in a lot of environments messy

01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:14.900
environments complex environments right that's adaptive that's why we do it but

01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:20.980
it makes us vulnerable to environments that aren't ones we evolved to fit like

01:02:20.980 --> 01:02:27.980
the internet where we can rapidly get access to hundreds and hundreds of

01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:32.700
people confirming our belief in something and then when that goes to that

01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:36.700
starvation for meaning then we don't want to give up any beliefs we can just

01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:41.420
again and then we can we can just do this we I can reinforce your confirmation

01:02:41.420 --> 01:02:45.620
bias you can reinforce mine my my collaborator and good friend Leo

01:02:45.620 --> 01:02:49.580
Ferrero he calls this confirmation porn we can get into this kind of

01:02:49.580 --> 01:02:56.420
pornography of just confirming and confirming and we get locked in and

01:02:56.420 --> 01:03:00.780
then we more and more identify with it because you're telling me yeah yeah

01:03:00.780 --> 01:03:04.700
that's the way the world is and so I'm more and more and then we just cycle in

01:03:04.700 --> 01:03:10.660
this is a phenomenon that my friend and colleague Mark Lewis in his work on

01:03:10.660 --> 01:03:17.020
addiction calls reciprocal narrowing and then I think that the and I said I

01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:21.060
said this to Mark I think the platonic wisdom tradition talks about an opposite

01:03:21.060 --> 01:03:26.740
thing we can cultivate which is reciprocal opening so echo chambers are

01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:30.860
reciprocal narrowing and when look think what happens to the addict the addict

01:03:30.860 --> 01:03:35.380
loses cognitive flexibility and so their options in the world go down so the

01:03:35.380 --> 01:03:40.140
world gets more and more narrow and then they internalize that and then they get

01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:44.820
more and more narrow and that until I can't be any other than I am the world

01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:49.620
can't be any other than it is and that's addiction so this echo chambering is

01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:53.580
very analogous to that reciprocal narrowing that's going on in addiction

01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:57.780
and we we are addicted to a lot of stuff I mean the addiction crisis as I

01:03:57.780 --> 01:04:03.140
mentioned is one of the issue we're more and more finding ourselves addicted to

01:04:03.140 --> 01:04:06.980
more and more things and there's more and more people that are exploiting us

01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:13.140
politically economically by getting us addicted and the internet has algorithms

01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:20.180
that do that. I think that this is a really really important topic right now

01:04:20.180 --> 01:04:27.580
because PTSD is a household term yes but post-traumatic growth very few people

01:04:27.580 --> 01:04:31.780
have even heard of that I know the lack of awareness that things can be great on

01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:35.660
the other side of difficult experiences that just seems like a responsible thing

01:04:35.660 --> 01:04:41.620
to know yes talk about so this is a serious concern of ours as we put this

01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:46.180
documentary out there is an invalidation or perception of an invalidation of an

01:04:46.180 --> 01:04:50.980
experience people assuming that because we're talking about post-traumatic

01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:56.060
growth PTSD doesn't exist or we're anti PTSD and so I would love to talk to you

01:04:56.060 --> 01:05:01.300
about this or if you can explain a little bit about or just if I were to speak on

01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:09.940
behalf of that person right now my echo chamber makes me feel heard you know I

01:05:09.940 --> 01:05:15.220
feel like I have a community yes I'm infertile and I'm seeing how hard other

01:05:15.220 --> 01:05:20.020
women have it yes yes that feels good but to what extent and when does that

01:05:20.020 --> 01:05:25.780
become a negative experience right and so that's that's a really beautiful

01:05:25.780 --> 01:05:31.180
question I thought that's well well framed and a problem well framed is you

01:05:31.180 --> 01:05:38.980
know the the beginning of insight so I mean there's a lot of variables and and

01:05:38.980 --> 01:05:44.980
the and this is not to derail what we're doing but the literature on you know

01:05:44.980 --> 01:05:48.140
post-traumatic growth is going like the scientific literature is in this

01:05:48.140 --> 01:05:52.860
liminal place because we're sort of through first wave and then there's been

01:05:52.860 --> 01:05:56.620
a second critical wave and now people are coming out of that and there so we're

01:05:56.660 --> 01:06:04.180
trying to get a more sophisticated answer to a very complex phenomenon but let's

01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:08.700
go back to the so I want I want that as sort of the general frame in which we're

01:06:08.700 --> 01:06:12.100
talking about this let's go back to the what's the difference between a support

01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:18.460
group like AA and right an echo chamber because they do share important

01:06:18.460 --> 01:06:25.540
similarities and so one of the things you given what we've said one of the things

01:06:25.660 --> 01:06:28.740
you should look for at least a set of things is you should look for is your

01:06:28.740 --> 01:06:35.700
group actually promoting cognitive flexibility is it promoting reciprocal

01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:40.100
opening is it helping you to gain more flexibility are you having more aha

01:06:40.100 --> 01:06:44.180
moments now the thing about these groups is they give you initial oh I didn't

01:06:44.180 --> 01:06:48.180
realize that the leprechauns were behind it all and stuff like that right so

01:06:48.180 --> 01:06:53.860
right and they give you sort of pseudo insight so you have to ask yourself this

01:06:53.980 --> 01:06:59.220
question are the insights in the cognitive flexibility within the group

01:06:59.220 --> 01:07:04.820
transferring to your life outside of the group let me give you a really good

01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:09.300
analogy for this think about different kinds of video games or let's comply

01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:13.860
one kind I'm not saying all video games are like this I'm not let's say one kind

01:07:13.860 --> 01:07:18.100
of video game and something like Tai Chi Chuan and this was a transformative

01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:22.580
thing for me not the video games of the Tai Chi Chuan okay so you know people

01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:27.620
one of the reasons kids love video games is because video games are flow induction

01:07:27.620 --> 01:07:32.260
machines they they're they're like jazz they are reliable for putting people

01:07:32.260 --> 01:07:42.100
into the flow state right so within that world they're just but you get video

01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:48.340
game addiction the WHO has designated an addiction when that doesn't transfer to

01:07:48.340 --> 01:07:54.740
your life so the skills like all and the perspective of the states of

01:07:54.740 --> 01:07:57.620
consciousness in mind their sense of identity and self because you're

01:07:57.620 --> 01:08:00.420
manipulating those and video games like a religion

01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:06.980
right is that is that percolating through the rest of your psyche is it

01:08:06.980 --> 01:08:09.540
permeating through your life is it transferring

01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:15.380
when I was doing Tai Chi and I started back in 91

01:08:15.380 --> 01:08:21.940
before cell phones right the ancient times I was in grad school like I said I

01:08:21.940 --> 01:08:25.860
was doing the Tai Chi for cultivating wisdom I was in grad school at the time

01:08:27.460 --> 01:08:30.980
and it's funny because when you're in grad school you're always you always feel like

01:08:30.980 --> 01:08:34.180
you're an imposter right I don't really belong here they're going to find out

01:08:34.180 --> 01:08:40.660
eventually right the people came up to me my friends and I've been doing the

01:08:40.740 --> 01:08:45.460
Tai Chi like religiously in both senses of the word I was doing it every day for

01:08:45.460 --> 01:08:49.060
two or three hours a day and I was having all these amazing experiences you know

01:08:49.060 --> 01:08:53.060
the days when you you're as hot as fire and the days where you're as cold as ice

01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:58.500
and you're getting into the flow state and it's amazing but I was just I was just in that world

01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:05.460
they came up to me and they said what's up with you what do you mean they said you're different

01:09:05.460 --> 01:09:10.420
you're way more flexible in your thinking you're way more empathetic and picking up on other

01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:19.220
people you're way more balanced in your argumentation and I realized oh the Tai Chi was moving beyond

01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:24.260
the martial art arena and it was percolating through my psyche it's permeating through my

01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:27.940
lives it was transforming and that's because I wasn't just doing the Tai Chi Chuan I was doing

01:09:27.940 --> 01:09:33.220
these ecologies and I was learning the philosophy of Taoism and so it was like and that's what

01:09:33.220 --> 01:09:40.020
religions do they give you these and it does that that's my criteria if you're in your support

01:09:40.100 --> 01:09:47.300
group and whatever's happening here you feel that it's percolating through your psyche in a way

01:09:47.300 --> 01:09:55.060
that's permeating through your life and opening up your life and you've got a support group if you

01:09:55.060 --> 01:10:01.620
feel it's taking you down and you're getting locked in and you can only find that in the group

01:10:02.420 --> 01:10:07.460
then you're moving towards an addiction you're moving towards kind of spirituality

01:10:07.540 --> 01:10:13.700
you're moving towards a cult now those are on a continuum I present them as opposites for contrast

01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:17.780
but we they're on a continuum and there's going to be stuff in the gray zone it's going to be I'm

01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:21.780
not sure when I get that and that's going to take discernment and discussion and reflection

01:10:21.780 --> 01:10:29.620
but that's how I would say is it open are you reciprocally opening comprehensively

01:10:29.620 --> 01:10:33.780
about across more and more in your life are your existing relationships getting better

01:10:33.780 --> 01:10:38.340
are you feeling more in touch with reality are you able to cultivate new friendships are you

01:10:38.340 --> 01:10:44.340
able to cultivate new virtues the answer is yes chances are you have a support group if the answer

01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:49.060
to those increasingly if those is increasingly no chances are you're locking you're locking into

01:10:49.060 --> 01:11:00.660
an echo chamber thank you okay last question for me um is are there any other areas of research

01:11:00.660 --> 01:11:08.500
that if you had another you that can explore whatever and you just don't have time for right

01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:14.340
now is there any like like epigenetics or something that feel like could be a really cool thread to go

01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:24.100
down with your work oh boy um I I joke with my colleagues um like my dear friend Dan Chappie

01:11:24.100 --> 01:11:27.380
we've published a bunch of stuff together we're always working together I don't know if you know

01:11:27.380 --> 01:11:32.500
but there's a there's a science fiction classic show called Dr. Who and he has the TARDIS which is

01:11:32.500 --> 01:11:36.420
you know trans dimensional and all this I want a TARDIS where I can go in there and be outside

01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:41.220
time and space and do a bunch of stuff and then come back out there I have to tell you Jessica

01:11:41.220 --> 01:11:46.740
there's so many books that I'm like I'm currently reading about 30 books at a time it's a skill I've

01:11:46.740 --> 01:11:51.220
been cultivating for like three decades I don't recommend it for anybody as a novice but even

01:11:51.220 --> 01:11:57.060
that I feel like just I look at all the books I'm not reading and I go I need to know this because

01:11:57.060 --> 01:12:03.940
you know I'm more ignorant than than than than I have knowledge I would like to know a lot more

01:12:03.940 --> 01:12:14.580
about neuroscience I would like to know a lot more about like I I've studied some I've studied both

01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:18.980
from the outside as an academic and from the inside as a practitioner Taoism and Buddhism

01:12:18.980 --> 01:12:23.940
Christianity Neil Platonism Stoicism but there's a whole bunch like I don't know very much about

01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:31.140
Islam not enough about Judaism not enough about lots of aspects of Hinduism Vedanta the indigenous

01:12:31.140 --> 01:12:36.420
stuff I know a bit about shamanism but to equate that to indigenous culture is like terrifically

01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:43.300
racist and ethnocentric so I admit that I'm mostly ignorant I want to know I just yeah like so I

01:12:43.300 --> 01:12:50.580
the hard neuroscience up to you know you know the cultural anthropology those are the two ends of

01:12:50.580 --> 01:12:56.820
my where I feel that I need to know more that's where I mean I need to fill in a lot in between

01:12:56.820 --> 01:13:02.420
that sounded arrogant pretentious but where I feel the gap most prominently is on those ends

01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:05.940
awesome thank you thank you so much
