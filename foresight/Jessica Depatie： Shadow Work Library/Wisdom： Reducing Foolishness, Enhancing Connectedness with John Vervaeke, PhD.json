{"text": " my name is John Rovicki perfect okay John so would you tell us a little bit about what you do for a living what is your life's work the main thing I guess is I have sort of two things I'm doing one is I'm a bona fide academic I'm an associate professor at the University of Toronto in cognitive psychology and cognitive science so I study the nature of cognition how we learn solve problems I also study related phenomena like wisdom meaning in life consciousness mindfulness altered states of consciousness mystical experiences and so that's something I've been studying as a long time as an academic I'm also a longtime practitioner I been practicing meditation contemplation Tai Chi Chuan for like 30 years so that's one thing I'm doing and then starting I guess about was it 2019 I started an online presence I did a video series called awakening from the meaning crisis in which I was addressing the issue that most people are finding increasingly finding it increasingly difficult to find meaning in life and to get a framework in which they can cultivate wisdom or perhaps even an appreciation of the sacred within a scientific worldview and then I've been doing a lot of series around that and trying to get those two things those two aspects of my life thankfully are mutually supportive and to try and get them even better coordinated to try and address the meaning crisis that I mentioned great what is it about your personality or even the events that have happened in your past life that got you interested in all these different things well that's a really good question and so for me the the pivotal moment or at least the pivotal episode perhaps it's a better way of putting it I was brought up in a fundamentalist Christian family and of course I love my family this is extended family and so I'm not trying to criticize them as people but I found I guess given my personality my own line of psychosocial development that I found that experience ultimately traumatizing it really had a sort of profound negative impact on me but it is very sort of bivalent for me because your first religion well we have this term your mother tongue the first language you you you learn is with you always and it informs everything else well you can you sort of have like a mother religion too and so it left the taste in my mouth if I can put it that way for transcendence and for seeking deeper connection and meaning in a sense for the sacred dimension to reality but at the same time I was traumatized by the existing religion and then I was I basically set out on this path to try and resolve that sort of meaning crisis I was experiencing myself and when I was in university I encountered the figure of Socrates in the cultivation of wisdom and this opened up an avenue for me and so from there I started going down the road but the academic study of wisdom it drops off the table after like first year university even within philosophy which is ironic given that the love of wisdom is literally what philosophy means now I went on to studies philosophy because I valued the sort of meta science and medical to critique and the tools it was giving but that hunger for wisdom and transcendence was missing and so I started I went to a place and I started learning Tai Chi Chuan and meditation and contemplation and then that started to really satisfy that hunger for wisdom and transcendence but for me as I was doing this right the cognitive science world was starting to move more and more towards these topics and when I started to talk about these topics within my academic courses at the university I was noticing that they were really catching with the students these were the things they were like getting really fascinated in I think it was the first person at the University of Toronto to start talking about my mindfulness within a scientific perspective and then they started asking me to teach the courses on meditation contemplation extracurricular and I did that for a long time and so I noticed this confluence and I noticed that many of my students were resonating with that confluence and so I started to do more and more about building that bridge the bridge between science and spirituality to address the meeting crisis I really resonate with that on a personal level I always thought that that's what college was supposed to be like and you expand you have these transcended experiences but not that for me. And your case is not by any means unique many of the students after sorry this isn't meant to be self-promotional but many students after they're taking the classes with me they will say something like that this is what I wanted University to be and I don't know why the other courses aren't like that so yeah very much there's a there's a need that's not being met right now now to be fair there's a lot of other people like me doing this kind of work and one of the advantages gifts of doing my series was I've got I've been able to meet them and started interacting with them. You had mentioned meditation and contemplation. Now meditation is something that many people are familiar with whether they do it correctly or not but contemplation is a word that you don't hear too often and I was wondering if you could explain a little bit about that. This goes right towards my academic work but it also is something that I use when I'm trying to train I talk about two languages we you have to coordinate there's a language of explaining which you'd use in science and then there's a language of training which you're using when people are trying to cultivate things so let me let's not talk initially about meditation and contemplation let's talk about their common root in attention and so what I want you to notice is that your attention is we have a sort of a like a spotlight model of attention that what we do is shine our attention and on something that makes it stand out and that's right in so far as attention changes how things stand out for you how salient they are but there's a lot more going on so for one thing one of the things you can do with your attention is you can focus on me as a whole gestalt or you can zoom in to a feature and you go back and forth and that's dynamic you're constantly doing it because of what Marlo Ponte called an optimal grip like you're constantly like it when you're looking at my hand depends what your what your goal is whether or not you focus like let's say if you wanted to see if I was married you might look at the ring finger but if you want to see if I worked with my hands a lot you might go more gestalt like you're gonna move in and out until you get the balance between detail and the whole and you're constantly doing that with your attention gestalt and feature so you're constantly doing that but there's another thing you can do and let me use an analogy for that it's one that's become a somewhat of a mean for my work but it's still good maybe that's why it became a mean and so I use this when I'm teaching also my students meditation and I want you to notice something think about my glasses my glasses are literally framing my experience there's right and I'm looking through them in both senses of the word I'm looking past them and by means of them now so right now my glasses are actually transparent to me but I can do this sometimes I have to step back and look at my glasses rather than looking right through them so now my glasses are opaque and why would I do that because I might want to clear some gunk off on my glasses right you're always mentally framing so your mind you're not at most the time looking at your mind you're looking through your mind at the world and you're framing it in terms of what you're focusing in on as salient what you're focusing in on as relevant what your backgrounding and foregrounding do you see how dynamic it is like soon as you and it's been it's constantly shifting it's like this I call it a shifting salience landscape so you're constantly doing that now just like your glasses are transparent to you and you might not notice how they're distorting your vision your mental framing can be transparent to you and you're not noticed and what you do in meditation is you first learn to step back and look at your mental framing rather than looking through it this is really what's meant by centering your attention it doesn't mean just focusing it's you're stepping back and looking at and you also are trying to break up the Gestalt patterns into the feature details right so you're stepping back and looking at the mind right and then instead of just gestalting you're also going in and trying to break up the features notice the patterns and processes that are going on because you're trying to see how that might be distorting now think about this that's a valuable thing to do in meditation but what would you need to do in order to see if you've actually cleaned your glasses what would you need to do wow no because what I would think you'd do first is put them on and see if you see differently right that's what contemplation is contemplation is going the other way it's trying to look more deeply into reality and to grab the the big picture the Gestalt and to see if you can seem better than you could before that's contemplation the word contemplation you can hear the word temple in contemplation temple means to to look out to look up to the sky the Latin contemplatio is a translation of the Greek word theoria which means to look deeply it's where we get our word theory from to look deeply into things and so what you have to do is you actually have to cycle between these you have to step back and see if it's distorting you make changes and see if that makes a difference in how you see the world and if you see the world and you start to see how more how it really is that guides you in saying oh I bet this is distorting my vision and then you see what you do you cycle back and forth between meditation and contemplation one of my criticisms of how the West is appropriating or misappropriating mindfulness traditions is they tend to only concentrate on one of these typically meditation if you look at the ecology of practices what in cultures where the mindful these mindfulness practices are more indigenous what you find is people have a whole set of practices they have meditative practices contemplative practices moving practices and interpersonal social practices because you need to be cultivating them all together because they act like checks and balances on each other that's great I want to step back a bit and talk about the state of the world right now so we can for sure cover why this is important so we all know we're living in an interesting time it seems cordial but it's stressful it can be stressful people are on edge there's a lot going on you can see that with suicide rates last couple of years and I was wondering a leading question why you think the reason for that is so in science you you find things that seem disconnected and you do what's called an inference to the best explanation you try and come up with the best explanation for all of these disconnected things that unites them together that's how you afford understanding so I have a proposal in that sense I think it's a theory that's born out by evidence that a lot of these that you can see a lot of what I call symptoms almost like the way a doctor looks at various things and through them sees an underlying disease I call them symptoms of the meeting crisis this goes to work I did with Christopher Mastipriaccio Philip Misovic and the idea is that you can see a lot of markers of distress as negative symptoms you can also see a lot of markers of positive response and you can give a unified explanation of this in terms of how people are responding to the meeting crisis either in a malfunction a way or in a functional way so as you already mentioned you know suicide especially among the younger generations and going out child suicide is now becoming an issue which is a that's a profound marker that something's going wrong interestingly Tatiana shell has Chanel has got provided good evidence that there's a direct line between a sense of loss of meaning and suicide that doesn't have to pass through clinical depression so we used to think people are clinically depressed and they sort of sense meaninglessness or meaninglessness try triggers clinical depression and that leads to suicide but it looks like no people can go directly from the sense of meaninglessness into suicide there was a survey in Great Britain I think it was 2017 something like 89% of the adult survey thought their lives were meaningless and there's overwhelming evidence that that is predictive of a lot of things going wrong the survey also showed another symptom of the meaning crisis a loneliness epidemic right as you mentioned a mental health epidemic we're getting you know rise mark you know rise we're getting an increase in the markers for depression measurements of depression anxiety disorders related we're getting various addiction crises the opioid crisis so these are all markers of this meaning crisis you get the the rise it's funny I was actually interviewed by rebel wisdom just at the beginning of COVID and I was predicting a rise in what Jules Evans calls he resurrected the term conspirituality which is a mixture of conspiracy theories and spirituality practices like QAnon and things like that and you see that as another marker but you also see some positive responses you see the rise of and we've talked about it already although I have some criticisms of it but you see the rise of the mindfulness movement as an attempt to respond to that you see the rise of Hellenistic philosophies like stoicism is going through this huge revival that you see the attempts to import Buddhism and stoicism Buddhism and Taoism into the West in order and you see the emergence and I get to be involved with these people of new communities Rafe Kelly's evolved move play where people are integrated he does where he takes people out into the woods and they do parkour right and then they do mindfulness and they do martial arts and then they do campfire discourse where people are doing all of this to try and enhance meaning in life so this whole like that would look sort of chaotic and disparate but if you pause it that all of this can be seen as a response to a profound sense of loss of meaning or meaning being under threat meaning in life then you can explain all of those in terms of this idea of the meaning crisis and so I would suggest that the reason why a lot of people are under stress right now and pursuing various strategies to try and intensify meaning is exactly that meaning crisis well I did 25 hours of lecture on the awakening for the meaning crisis to try and give an answer to that question so I will do my best to try and collapse that into a couple of minutes of a response there's two basic dimensions to answering a question that are really important one is a structural dimension what is meaning what are we talking about and why does it come under threat why is it at risk and then the second is a historical so let me talk about the first because I need the first to explain the second so here's the basic idea and this is this this for me is this is where I'm placing all my epistemic and career bets because for me this is this is the lich pin which is the centrality of meaning so it goes like this you are a cognitive agent you can move in many domains and solve many problems within many domains you're really really interesting and I don't mean to make you sound like a specimen but I find that so fascinating about human beings that they have this capacity and what's what that what seems to be I would argue and what I published on at the core of this is this really unique ability we have and which and why it strikes me is so unique it's the thing we're trying to give artificial intelligence and we haven't figured out how to do it and we're this is this is the although we're making progress so I want you to notice that you're doing it right now and it goes back to that salience landscaping I was talking about so the amount of information that's actually available to you in the technical definition of information is combinatorial explosive it's astronomically vast do you know the amount of information you have in your long-term memory all the possible combinations connections you could make astronomically vast you know all the sequences of behavior you could put together astronomically vast but you know what you're doing right now out of all of the information out there all the information in here and all the possibilities of how you could behave you're zeroing in on the relevant information like that like that how do you do it it's a really hard question I dedicated my life to trying to figure it out now think about how you need that moment by moment by moment and no one has said it's not static you're constantly shifting and notice what's going on even right and this gives you a bit of a clue I would argue as to how you're doing it part of your mind is trying to select and focus in and part of your mind wants to wander off and think about other things and so part of your mind is trying to open up possibilities and then another part is selecting from all those possibilities right and it's doing this and that's just like the process of evolution you have variation and selection variation and selection so notice what that does it makes certain things about me and what I'm saying stand out and other things you don't even consider them now that's that's what's so cool this sounds like a Zen coin you know what makes you intelligent your ability to ignore most of the information that's available to you so what you're doing and this is a very technical sense is you're biasing your attention that's how you're intelligent but you pay a price for that you're biasing your attention and there's check there's are you're always always subject to this vulnerability that that bias is going to turn out to be a prejudice that you actually missed the information you needed every year until very recently because phones have made this go down but until the advent of cell phones this would regularly happen people would go into a dark place where they knew there was flammable gas dispersed and they knew they needed light so they would strike a match and what were they focusing on what was relevant to them is that the match is a source of light and what they ignored was a match is also a source of heat and they would blow themselves up right so we are always sub so the very processes these evolving dynamic processes that make us intelligent also make us perpetually susceptible to self-deception self destructive self-deception and we're doing it all the time a great place people realize this is in the romantic lives I say oh I know what I did wrong there I'm gonna do the exact opposite with this person and then they get into it and they go oh I'm doing it again I'm doing the same thing again although it's very hard for them to see it from the inside so across cultures across historical context people have developed ecologies of practices for interacting with this dynamic self-evolving relevance realization in order to try and ameliorate the foolishness that self-deceptive self-destructive behavior but there's a positive side because this is so central to you when people talk about feeling connected that's what they're talking about they're talking about that relevance realization it's relevant to me it's salient to me it draws me in relevance is always about what you're caring about as opposed to what you're ignoring and so people also not only do they need to ameliorate the foolishness they want to enhance the connectedness so they also have ecologies of practices that not only ameliorate the foolishness but enhance the connectedness that connectedness is what meaning in life is ameliorating foolishness enhancing connectedness enhancing meaning in life that's wisdom this is what I do with my students so that's the structural problem we need wisdom it's not optional for us to ignore it right and if you ask people do you want to be wiser they usually say well yeah of course do you want more meaning yeah do you want to be less self-deceptive self-destructive yeah but I'll ask my students I'll say where do you go for information oh social media the internet where do you go for knowledge a little bit slower science the universities then I'll say where do you go for wisdom and there's a silence some of them a little bit a shrinking minority will say maybe my religion but they're not very confident about that and that is the historical issue these ecologies of practices in which we cultivate wisdom have to be situated into a worldview that homes them that valorizes them that provides institutions and communities when I asked you what would you do you said I'd ask somebody if there was gunk on my glasses somebody else that's right we need a community transformation requires community it requires and a community requires a shared worldview and it requires right so you got a shared worldview a community an ecology of practices that's what religion provided and what we see historically for a lot of reasons is that is the decline the loss of what Peter Burger calls our sacred canopy I'm not advocating for Christianity I'm not doing that but what I'm saying is when we lost it for what the political and metaphysical and scientific reasons that we lost it we lost all of the functionality it provided for us in the cultivation of wisdom and meaning and here's the problem for us the scientific worldview and let's let I want you to remember I'm a scientist I love science but the scientific worldview can't address that problem and here's here's what I mean the scientific worldview has no explanation for science itself or for the meaning-making practices of the scientists that make science possible we and our science don't actually fit in to the scientific worldview we're a whole a gap but like a black hole within that worldview and so the very thing that is so successful so beautifully successful in so many domains is precisely incapable of addressing this historical loss of a worldview that homes wisdom and meaning I'm glad you brought that up because I did want to ask you being a part of the scientific community can mimic a spiritual community it seems like there is a religion of science happening also there can be and then there even been historical attempts like Auguste Comte to try and do that and there are I mean one of the things you see in the history of the West is as Christianity receded you get you get the attempt to fill in that vacuum with pseudo-religious ideologies political movements you know I would recommend very strongly that people consider that communism and Nazism are not just political phenomena they're also pseudo-religious phenomena in a profound way and so I mean and there's various ideologies left and right that people use and you can see various academic communities trying to plug in the sense of the sacred into the science by sort of fusing you know a particular political worldview liberalism or leftism or right right wingism whatever right to try and do that because science per se can't do that the attempt to turn science into religious framework with some people called scientism you see it happening with the with the academic community but on on its own science really can't do that much so it's usually glued together with a not scientifically based allegiance to a particular socio-political economic ideological vision of what the good life is and what good people are and what's the good what's the good future that we should be pursuing and things like that so we're talking about science and spirituality and one of your passions for bringing them closer together one of the things you'd mentioned on your first episode of your series is the different types of knowing and yeah for me like I think people need to know about that would you mind going through thank you for bringing that up because that that goes exactly towards the kind of bridging that's a wonderful question I deeply appreciate that and it's it's funny you're and I don't mean this in any way to denigrate my my two boys who are like the jewels of my life but your theories are kind of like your children and you don't know which and you when you don't know which one of these is going to take off and it's really interesting that this has been something that really that people have found very central so the idea is and this is one of the ways in which science is inadequate the idea is that there's four kinds of knowing and let's start with the one that's typified in science and that's prevalent in our culture especially in ideological movements which is propositional knowing so this is knowing that you you practice you practice this knowing by asserting propositions you say things like I believe that the earth is round that's a proposition and I believe it and what I do is I gather evidence for that particular proposition and if the evidence is enough I start to talk about and it gives me explanatory power I start talking about a theory and I get a sense of a conviction a sense of conviction that it's true and of course ideologies make those same kinds of moves that's propositional knowing and for a very long time because of the scientific revolution and Descartes and because also of things going on in the Protestant Reformation we have started to think that that's all knowing is just propositional knowing and we've done we've done similar reductions we've reduced faith to belief we treat them as if they're synonyms and we think that the most important thing for explaining somebody's behavior are their beliefs and so we get this massive reduction now what's happened in the cognitive science that I'm privileged to participate in there's been a revolution going on in the last you know 30 40 years it's called for e-cognitive science we can get into that at some point if you want but the main idea is I draw from that is that there are other kinds of knowing so there's procedural which isn't knowing that something is it the case it's knowing how to do something it's knowing how to catch a ball it's knowing how to kiss somebody right which isn't the same thing as having a bunch of beliefs about kissing that's why you could read a lot of books on kissing and it wouldn't make you a good kisser wouldn't make you a good martial artist it can help but it's not it's nowhere near enough knowing how has a lot more to do not with theories it has to do with skills about how to right build up sensory motor patterns of interaction with the world and and the sense of realness there isn't the sense of truth it's a sense of power like when you have a skill you have expertise and that's why you give authority to a doctor because they have a sense of skills obviously they have beliefs but if they had the beliefs without the skills would you go to the doctor no way right so that's procedural knowing it's knowing how interestingly the forms of memory associated with the two kinds of knowing are distinct your semantic memory your memory of facts is distinct from your procedural memory your knowledge of skills so you can lose one without losing the other so now related to that is another one which is think of what you need for your skills you need what's called situational awareness so is your skill of swimming relevant right now should you activate it should you get you start swim now because it's not relevant here I mean if the room suddenly flooded with water it could be so you need situational awareness to tell you which skills to activate which skills you might need to acquire right so what's the situational awareness what kind of knowing is that well this is knowing what it's like to be here right now the here nowness so this is member I mentioned it this is your knowing by salience landscaping how are you salience landscaping how are you sizing up this situation right what's your state of mind right so you have this this episodic memory which is a combination of your state of mind in this situation so think of the difference in your memory between remembering that two plus two equals four and your memory of your last birthday one is just this fact that just hangs out the other is you recall the situation a scene what stands out what's foregrounded what's backgrounded and you recall your corresponding and co-determining state of mind so you recall your perspective this is perspectival knowing now its sense of realness isn't the conviction of truth or power we know what it is because and I do work on this just published some papers on it with Dan Schiappi right in terms of virtual reality so what are people looking for that they want the game to be real what are they looking for it's called a sense of presence so that perspectival knowing gives you a sense of realness when you have a sense that you're really here really now really connected really present it's a sense of presence as a realness okay what's under that what's under that is you don't come into this situation as a blank slate contrary to what John Locke said you come in with your biology your biological evolutionary heritage and your culture shaping you and the environment to fit each other this chair is suitable for me I can sit on it that's an affordance it affords sitting it wouldn't afford sitting for an elephant right this glass this glass is graspable by me evolution has shaped me to pick up objects like this and then culture has taught me to shape my hand this way and and made objects that fit my hand so this if this for me this is graspable the graspability is not in the glass it's not in my hand but in the way my hand and the glass have been shaped to each other by evolution and by culture and by my ongoing state of mind this is an idea from Gibson and it's at the core of 40 cognitive science right that you have right the way though you and your environment are co-shaping each other and opening up a whole network of affordances that are available to you for interacting with the world this is your participatory knowing this is your knowing by being this is the relationship between your agency and how the world is disclosed to you as an arena for action and they're mutually belonging together now you have semantic memory for propositional knowing you have procedural memory right for procedural knowing you have episodic memory for perspective knowing what kind of memory do you have for this participatory belonging in the world a profound kind of memory you call yourself your sense of self your sense of identity this is the deep kind of memory a deep kind of knowing so when you know something by binding yourself to it perhaps the way you should know your partner right so your self-knowledge and your knowledge of your partner are bound up together and they co-evolve and they shape each other right and the two people right more and more conform to each other and afford each other's transformation so you know love is the the medieval's had this that love is its own way of knowing love is a primary example of participatory knowing the kind of knowing that you can only have by loving something right so the participatory knowing sets out the affordances the perspective of knowing makes certain affordances salient and stand out so it and then that activates what skills you're going to bring into the interaction and then as you're interacting you bring out the facts that are relevant to your interaction and that's how they all work so the scientific worldview locks us here in the propositional and most of that relevance realization that connectedness is happening on at the levels of the non propositional knowing this is another profound reason why science qua science can't give us the meaning now what science can do is give us the science of those kinds of knowing so that we can better engineer the psychotechnologies the practices that will enhance them that will make them wiser and more meaningful enhance that connectedness so this is taking me to altered states of consciousness I would love to talk about that of course you should I think that so many of us are stuck focusing on the wrong things or just at least very narrow things on our TV screens social media and the few people that we have in our very small circles now how do you feel that how do you feel altered states of consciousness fall into helping us with this meaning so that is also a really profound question and I would I would suggest to you that the renaissance of interest in psychedelics both academically and culturally is another symptomatic response to the meaning crisis people are craving enhanced connectedness the kind of union and self-transcendence and as you said they're trying to break out of too narrow of framing on reality and that's why they're seeking them out and of course there's been a you know cross cultures cross history a long-standing connection between psychedelics and mystical experience so they're not the same but and and the cultivation of wisdom so we have to be very cautious about this because we have the very thing that the very reason why people and this is almost ironic the very reason why people might take psychedelics is the kind of misframing they could bring to the psychedelics which is they could get too focused and too narrow a framing of this psychedelic experience so altered states of consciousness psychedelic experience mystical experience one of the ways of thinking about them one of the ways I've been arguing up with lots of people like Dana Craig and others we've been working on this idea Jensen Kim a bunch of people is I want you to remember an experience that probably happens to you every day and I want to use that and put it on a continuum with altered states so you've had an aha moment can you remember one recently where you realized oh I'm looking at this in completely the wrong way at that aha experience where you've been thinking about something you're right I should think about it this way I was the wrong I was concentrating on the wrong thing the fact that you asked me that question means you've had that experience so I study this I study is called insight and notice what it means to see a to see into something right so what's happening in an insight experience notice that we often talk about it like a flash of insight what's happening is your salience landscape is suddenly shifting often they'll represented in movies with things coming in and out of the foreground of the background right so what's happening is a very dynamic reconfiguration of your salience landscape right so you ask people well what grows from an acorn and oak what's this stroke what's the gray stuff that comes off fire smoke what's the white of an egg called and people say the yolk and you were gonna say right but the answer is the white of the egg but what were you doing you were concentrating on the oak sound you foregrounded that as relevant and then so you looked for the part of the egg that has the oak sound in it you said yolk and then you laughed because humor is related to insight because you realized that you had misframed the situation okay now we are doing that all the time because like I said the relevance realization process is constantly evolving and sometimes though that evolution goes through this dynamic shift of self-correction this is why insight is so associated with wisdom if you ask people could somebody be not that educated but really wise they go yeah I think so what if they weren't very artistic could they be wise yeah I think so could they be not very insightful and wise they go no they got to be insightful to be wise there's a deep connection there because they realize that insight is a little micro moment of increased wisdom it's a little moment of self-transcendence it's a little moment when you're breaking out of that narrow frame and you've got a moment when you realized oh I was looking at it the wrong way now what I want you to consider is that capacity for self-transcendence self-correction right and it comes with a change in consciousness there's a flash it's on a continuum so if you get a bunch of these insights at least that's what I published with Leo Ferrero and Erin Herobinat in 2018 and you start chaining them together so an insight leads to another insight leads to another insight like think about somebody playing jazz they're playing jazz and they pick up and they break frame and make a new frame and then they have to break the frame and make and they're constantly they get into what's called the flow state athletes seek this out because it's optimal you're at your very best and it feels like the most amazing experience like in your act right so you're in the zone and I get it like as a martial artist I get it when I'm lecturing and notice what people say it's like they now talk about the whole world being super salient they feel that one with their environment they feel deeply connected that's that enhanced meaning right and flow states is when they start to feel like they're they have that really deep connectedness but they're self-transcending they report a loss of self-consciousness my consciousness you know that mattering narrative nanny in your head how do I look how are people thinking of me what's going on do they like me all of that all of that goes away because they're so at one and like when you're a martial artist like if you're sparring in your in your flow like it's so amazing you know at one level you're making all this effort but your hand just goes for the block and you just find the opening for the punch right or right or it's so that's the flow state notice how that's already a profound altered state of consciousness now one of the interesting features about flow Chikset Mahai has studied this for decades is it's a universal it happens to people regardless of their gender their socio-economic status their language their cultural background across all of this people describe the flow experience in almost the same light the same terms of the same level of detail so it's something profound going on because it's enhancing right this this relevance realization this connectedness this capacity for self-transcendence now take flow and its altered state of consciousness and ramp it up instead of flowing as I'm sparring right or as I'm writing poetry or as I'm playing jazz what have I flowed at the level of my grant my relationship to reality as a whole what have I got into a flow state at the level of my world view so I was doing what Blake said I was seeing a world in a grain of sand that everything is interpenetrating and I'm getting this flow that's from the gestalt to the feature and in and out to the center of my psyche out to the depths of the world as a flow experience and imagine how that's going to transform your salience landscaping and how it's going to even more reduce that that self-consciousness it's going to be like a super awe experience those are mystical experiences and then there's an overlap between psychedelic experiences and even lion I just I interviewed him from my one of my channels he's writing a book it's coming out called psychedelic experience and he points out that psychedelic experiences don't have to use substances there's other ways of triggering them and so you got you so you got insight flow psychedelic experiences mystical experiences and then when mystical experiences put people in touch with what they call the really real the most real this is what's so fascinating about it they will transform their lives their roles their relationships often their occupation in order to conform more and more to that really real they'll invert everything so normally what we do is the everyday is the real and anything that's off that's aberrant from that like a dream or when we're drunk we go that's not real people do the opposite in these experience they have these experiences the real really real and they say that's real and all of this is less real and they change their lives because we want to be in touch with what's most real and so altered states of consciousness are are so sought after now because they give us the capacity for enhancing all of that continuum from insight to transformative experience giving us the self-transcendence the opportunity to get profound insight cultivate wisdom and transform our sense of self all the kinds of knowing and so of course we're seeking it but here's the danger here's the danger right if you don't have that situated within an already existing ecology of practices in which you're cultivating wisdom and a community that is giving you a worldview you can spin off you can spin off from these altered states you can go down various rabbit holes you can get into echo chambers you can come up with wacky metaphysics all kinds of strange things happening so and I get into a little bit of trouble not like officially but with the university and also I think I pissed people off a little bit because I say two things and it sounds like contradiction I say we should not prohibit substances doesn't work doesn't work I'm really confident about that doesn't work okay but we should also license the use of them like we do for a car or a handgun these are powerful tools you don't give a five year old a chainsaw you don't give somebody in fact who doesn't know how to use a chainsaw a chainsaw if you're gonna cut through the cords of your life because you're seeking profound transformation you better know how to use that tool right it's called the mind sword in you know in some of the Buddhist traditions you know you better learn like and that's what decisive means by the way it means to cut right if you if you don't know how to wield that properly there's a potential for getting into some very significant self-deceptive self-destructive behavior so I think that if we're cultivating altered states of consciousness through mindfulness practices through movement practices through group practices through the use of substances through breathing techniques that should always be properly situated within a sapiential sacred community I can see the problem with that argument where many things that are licensed start to become really rigid so I'd imagine that the whole licensing process of this look very different than anything else I mean we talk about doulas for example yeah licensing at least in the US for a long time because of that yes about the person and how can you license or restrict how that process goes for each human well we do it for other things so here's my counter example and you know this has become you know the case and there was this discussion around it but we do it with psychotherapy we like it's now the law that you can't practice psychotherapy unless you are approved by the college and the idea here is because we're engaging in something that has the capacity to you know radically transform people and therefore there is a power and we have to make sure that people have both the scientific and the skill and I would even add perhaps the moral training education so that they will wield that power responsibly thank you okay I want to back up to something about insight that it was great that you brought together the humor is human insight somehow go together yes so humor from all the people that we've interviewed so far has come up humor and martial art yes interestingly enough and it was funny I was thinking about the aha moment how it's like a aha moment yeah yeah yeah that's great I like that did you come up with that I have that's beautiful I like that so I was right you can talk a little bit more about humor and how that plays a role oh cognitive science but also very much and one of the things that intrigued me is you know the cross-cultural for study of spiritual traditions that have humor in them Zen has a lot of humor in it and others where the humor is much more much more backgrounded and held down so humor these three things are related humor metaphor and insight and and they don't come naturally to human beings we have to practice it with kids for a long time so try and get a four-year-old to tell a joke they're not very good at it try and get them to understand metaphor they're not very good at it and their insight capacity is also not that explicit to them so one of the ways of thinking about this goes to work that's been really developed well by you McGill Kristen I was privileged to have a conversation with him about but it lines up with work from Cuneas Beeman Bowden a whole bunch of people that they have a book called the Eureka factor having to do with the relationship between the hemispheres so we were talking about like your ability to solve problems and humor is actually making use of the problem-solving ability so I am getting there right now there's two kinds of problems you're facing all the time one is a problem that's very familiar to you it's very well-defined look like a prototypical example is a multiplication problem you know what kind of problem it is you know the actions you're supposed to perform you know when you're doing it right you know when it's doing wrong you know what the results supposed to look like very well-defined problem now compare solving a multiplication problem with going on a successful first date what's the rule there so what's the initial state well you're with some stranger okay what kind of problem is this well what should I do I don't know like when I was dating I remember did the advice my friends would give me was so useless was like look at her eyes but not too much laugh at her jokes but not too often try to be funny but not to ask questions but it's like right and so these are called ill-defined problems and ill-defined problems are pervasive in your environment and what your brain is really struggling to do again the framing is try and convert as many of those ill-defined problems into well-defined problems that you can build up habits and routines for right left hemisphere is about well-defined problems step-by-step narrow focus attention to detail not language that we people say languages in both hemispheres and that's stuff about drawing on the right side of your brain and you have an artist in your right hemisphere and you have some sort of fascist in your left hemisphere that's all ridiculous but the left hemisphere tends to focus on well-defined problems the right tends to focus on ill-defined problems so instead of focusing on detail it reaches for the gestalt so think of like I think of a classic ill-defined problem predator something's attacking you like you don't oh well what kind of predator is it let's get very clear you're dead right so you want to do open up you want to gestalt you it's ill-defined you want some very coarse-grained things you want to grab associations as fast as you can so what typically happens when people come into situations that are very ill-defined is you can see activity being initially predominant in the left of the right hemisphere now what happens in insight is you come to a problem and you think you know how to frame it oh yes I know how to do this the left hemisphere is very dominant and then you realize I don't know how to do this and you'll see the aha moment is when activity shifts from the left to the right and then what happens in the right is in here you're you're you're working within a frame and in here you're going all that frames don't and now you're looking for a frame and then when you get an alternative frame you bring it back you reframe your problem and that that that's aha something else that does that is metaphor metaphor also does that shift so when I say and we notice notice how much your cognition is drenched in metaphor I just did it by the way so you'll say things like we're halfway through this interview halfway way through we're not moving through space the interview I hope it's not too hard John I hope right I hope you're seeing what I'm saying I hope you're getting it I hope you're understanding it I hope you're right to see in fact try to say anything profound and meaningful to somebody without invoking a metaphor because you're trying to afford insight this is the work of lake often Johnson although I have some criticisms of the specifics of their theory okay so metaphor and insight and we use metaphor we use propositional metaphors to try and trigger non- propositional insight so and of course Shakespeare is an exemplar of this humor involves metaphor when it's verbal humor of some kind right and it involves a sudden reframing you have to get the punchline you have to have the aha moment that's why people will often retrospectively see a failure of insight as something funny they'll go oh haha so humor is it like one of the things you're doing when somebody gets a joke right is you're playing with things you know don't live leave alphabet soup on the you know boiling on the stove it could spell disaster okay it's a bad joke but but the point is notice how I'm playing right on two different meanings and moving between them and you got to shift the meaning right you got a reframe you have to have that insight and you do it retrospectively and it alleviates the tension between like there's a there's an initial problem and then you resolve it with insight and you play with sort of the metaphorical aspects of language we've got humor and then with other humor that's non-verbal we're doing sort of something analogously I would argue with like perspectival knowing things like that so humor metaphor insight are bound together and you can see why people who are seeking transformation would rely on them because they're what you're doing is you're trying to fuel and prime the engine of cognitive flexibility of your ability to reframe right and to alter what's salient and relevant to you in a way that connects to you that matters to you that's meaningful to you and of course that's going to help you take ill-defined situations like when something traumatic has happened to us or when some opportunity that's golden has suddenly opened up to us should I get involved with that person should I try that new career we're going to turn to these as a way of trying to enhance our ability to deal with ill-defined situations I need to believe so many people are resistant to taking their glasses off and seeing what's on there because I mean part of it is part of it is cultural we have truncated and reduced people's sense of their mind and their self and those aren't identical but they're related and so we people don't when people don't have the ability to access that cognitive flexibility and when they're in a meaning scarcity this is called scarcity mentality when human beings face any significant scarcity of food water of you know friendship relationship meaning they become very rigid they become very narrow they become very short-term in their thinking this is why you know sort of you know blaming people for bad behavior because they're poor is is perhaps getting things the wrong way around right instead right you think of people in scarcity so if we've taken all of the meaning and wisdom machinery away and we've really reduced people's sense of what they're what they are you are your beliefs and they're shrunk down here and they're starving of course they're going to be resistant to taking their glasses off they're going to be rigid and resistant and they're in fact they're going to double down on holding on to the beliefs with which they identify if you feel comfortable talking about this I'm not sure if this is your area of expertise so rebel wisdom yes they talk about sense-making yes sense-making and meaning making what's the relationship between them so they're they're they're they overlap to a great degree so sense-making was a term coined I think I believe by maybe it was O'Shamel but it was made prominent by Francisco Varela who is one of the pioneers of 4e cognitive science and then by my former colleague Evan Thompson who is like if you want to understand 4e cognitive science you have to look at Evan's work Evan is brilliant and profound and it was it was a loss when he left University of Toronto go to UBC so they coined this term of sense-making and the the basic idea is this that even a paramecium right is doing it's detecting its environment right and it's adapting and responding and so in its sensory motor behavior it's it is treating it's not seeing it doesn't have consciousness or everything like that but it's detecting this molecule as food food isn't part of physics like if you look in a physics textbook you won't you won't find a definition for food food is an affordance relationship between this chemical and this the autopoiesis the self-making of the paramecium the paramecium because it's constantly taking care of itself because it's a living thing it's caring about this I don't mean full blow in emotion but there's a kind of caring very small scale right there's a kind of caring of and it's also that molecule is poison so it swims away from that one and swims towards this one so it's doing sense-making it's making sense of its right of its environment now if you lift that sense-making up into what we could call kinds of knowing then the sense-making I would argue is meaning making in this time right now where people are trying to make sense of so much why do you do you feel that this is a skill that people could work to get better at I would be I'd be really strong about that I would say it's a necessity if you do not get better at waiting through all the bullshit and I use that in a very technical sense maybe you can ask me about that but if we do not get better and one of the other symptoms of the meeting crisis we track this in the book is people feel like bullshit and bullshitting is expanding both quantitatively there's more of it and it's in more domains and it's people are getting more and more shameless about the bullshitting which is really egregious if you don't do something about that toxicity right the way that that is radically undermining your capacity to connect to reality and exacerbating making you more and more prone to self-deceptive self-destructive behavior if you don't do anything about that given the way right social media is complexifying and with it the bullshitting is complexifying and permeating your life and percolating into the depths of the psyche and ways you're not aware of if you're watching if you're using lots of social media I will predict that you are suffering more depression and anxiety I'm confident about that if you don't do something to address and ameliorate that I strongly predict it's going to get worse for you with time and not only with you as an individual but with you and your group would you explain echo chambers sure so remember we talked about you know the way we we have to focus in and and and these are very adaptive now one of the things you do and I do too is we do what's called the confirmation bias now in a lot of environments this is adaptive so I want I want to understand that I want you to understand that but what does it mean well what does it mean is generally we don't look for information that challenges or disconfirms our belief we look for information that supports it that's confirmation bias again one more time right in a lot of environments messy environments complex environments right that's adaptive that's why we do it but it makes us vulnerable to environments that aren't ones we evolved to fit like the internet where we can rapidly get access to hundreds and hundreds of people confirming our belief in something and then when that goes to that starvation for meaning then we don't want to give up any beliefs we can just again and then we can we can just do this we I can reinforce your confirmation bias you can reinforce mine my my collaborator and good friend Leo Ferrero he calls this confirmation porn we can get into this kind of pornography of just confirming and confirming and we get locked in and then we more and more identify with it because you're telling me yeah yeah that's the way the world is and so I'm more and more and then we just cycle in this is a phenomenon that my friend and colleague Mark Lewis in his work on addiction calls reciprocal narrowing and then I think that the and I said I said this to Mark I think the platonic wisdom tradition talks about an opposite thing we can cultivate which is reciprocal opening so echo chambers are reciprocal narrowing and when look think what happens to the addict the addict loses cognitive flexibility and so their options in the world go down so the world gets more and more narrow and then they internalize that and then they get more and more narrow and that until I can't be any other than I am the world can't be any other than it is and that's addiction so this echo chambering is very analogous to that reciprocal narrowing that's going on in addiction and we we are addicted to a lot of stuff I mean the addiction crisis as I mentioned is one of the issue we're more and more finding ourselves addicted to more and more things and there's more and more people that are exploiting us politically economically by getting us addicted and the internet has algorithms that do that. I think that this is a really really important topic right now because PTSD is a household term yes but post-traumatic growth very few people have even heard of that I know the lack of awareness that things can be great on the other side of difficult experiences that just seems like a responsible thing to know yes talk about so this is a serious concern of ours as we put this documentary out there is an invalidation or perception of an invalidation of an experience people assuming that because we're talking about post-traumatic growth PTSD doesn't exist or we're anti PTSD and so I would love to talk to you about this or if you can explain a little bit about or just if I were to speak on behalf of that person right now my echo chamber makes me feel heard you know I feel like I have a community yes I'm infertile and I'm seeing how hard other women have it yes yes that feels good but to what extent and when does that become a negative experience right and so that's that's a really beautiful question I thought that's well well framed and a problem well framed is you know the the beginning of insight so I mean there's a lot of variables and and the and this is not to derail what we're doing but the literature on you know post-traumatic growth is going like the scientific literature is in this liminal place because we're sort of through first wave and then there's been a second critical wave and now people are coming out of that and there so we're trying to get a more sophisticated answer to a very complex phenomenon but let's go back to the so I want I want that as sort of the general frame in which we're talking about this let's go back to the what's the difference between a support group like AA and right an echo chamber because they do share important similarities and so one of the things you given what we've said one of the things you should look for at least a set of things is you should look for is your group actually promoting cognitive flexibility is it promoting reciprocal opening is it helping you to gain more flexibility are you having more aha moments now the thing about these groups is they give you initial oh I didn't realize that the leprechauns were behind it all and stuff like that right so right and they give you sort of pseudo insight so you have to ask yourself this question are the insights in the cognitive flexibility within the group transferring to your life outside of the group let me give you a really good analogy for this think about different kinds of video games or let's comply one kind I'm not saying all video games are like this I'm not let's say one kind of video game and something like Tai Chi Chuan and this was a transformative thing for me not the video games of the Tai Chi Chuan okay so you know people one of the reasons kids love video games is because video games are flow induction machines they they're they're like jazz they are reliable for putting people into the flow state right so within that world they're just but you get video game addiction the WHO has designated an addiction when that doesn't transfer to your life so the skills like all and the perspective of the states of consciousness in mind their sense of identity and self because you're manipulating those and video games like a religion right is that is that percolating through the rest of your psyche is it permeating through your life is it transferring when I was doing Tai Chi and I started back in 91 before cell phones right the ancient times I was in grad school like I said I was doing the Tai Chi for cultivating wisdom I was in grad school at the time and it's funny because when you're in grad school you're always you always feel like you're an imposter right I don't really belong here they're going to find out eventually right the people came up to me my friends and I've been doing the Tai Chi like religiously in both senses of the word I was doing it every day for two or three hours a day and I was having all these amazing experiences you know the days when you you're as hot as fire and the days where you're as cold as ice and you're getting into the flow state and it's amazing but I was just I was just in that world they came up to me and they said what's up with you what do you mean they said you're different you're way more flexible in your thinking you're way more empathetic and picking up on other people you're way more balanced in your argumentation and I realized oh the Tai Chi was moving beyond the martial art arena and it was percolating through my psyche it's permeating through my lives it was transforming and that's because I wasn't just doing the Tai Chi Chuan I was doing these ecologies and I was learning the philosophy of Taoism and so it was like and that's what religions do they give you these and it does that that's my criteria if you're in your support group and whatever's happening here you feel that it's percolating through your psyche in a way that's permeating through your life and opening up your life and you've got a support group if you feel it's taking you down and you're getting locked in and you can only find that in the group then you're moving towards an addiction you're moving towards kind of spirituality you're moving towards a cult now those are on a continuum I present them as opposites for contrast but we they're on a continuum and there's going to be stuff in the gray zone it's going to be I'm not sure when I get that and that's going to take discernment and discussion and reflection but that's how I would say is it open are you reciprocally opening comprehensively about across more and more in your life are your existing relationships getting better are you feeling more in touch with reality are you able to cultivate new friendships are you able to cultivate new virtues the answer is yes chances are you have a support group if the answer to those increasingly if those is increasingly no chances are you're locking you're locking into an echo chamber thank you okay last question for me um is are there any other areas of research that if you had another you that can explore whatever and you just don't have time for right now is there any like like epigenetics or something that feel like could be a really cool thread to go down with your work oh boy um I I joke with my colleagues um like my dear friend Dan Chappie we've published a bunch of stuff together we're always working together I don't know if you know but there's a there's a science fiction classic show called Dr. Who and he has the TARDIS which is you know trans dimensional and all this I want a TARDIS where I can go in there and be outside time and space and do a bunch of stuff and then come back out there I have to tell you Jessica there's so many books that I'm like I'm currently reading about 30 books at a time it's a skill I've been cultivating for like three decades I don't recommend it for anybody as a novice but even that I feel like just I look at all the books I'm not reading and I go I need to know this because you know I'm more ignorant than than than than I have knowledge I would like to know a lot more about neuroscience I would like to know a lot more about like I I've studied some I've studied both from the outside as an academic and from the inside as a practitioner Taoism and Buddhism Christianity Neil Platonism Stoicism but there's a whole bunch like I don't know very much about Islam not enough about Judaism not enough about lots of aspects of Hinduism Vedanta the indigenous stuff I know a bit about shamanism but to equate that to indigenous culture is like terrifically racist and ethnocentric so I admit that I'm mostly ignorant I want to know I just yeah like so I the hard neuroscience up to you know you know the cultural anthropology those are the two ends of my where I feel that I need to know more that's where I mean I need to fill in a lot in between that sounded arrogant pretentious but where I feel the gap most prominently is on those ends awesome thank you thank you so much", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 25.92, "text": " my
