1. **Support Groups vs. Cults**: A support group should enhance your life, improve your relationships, and help you become more in touch with reality. If it's leading to a decline in these areas, it might be turning into an echo chamber or even a cult.

2. **Tai Chi's Impact**: Engaging in Tai Chi Chuan can influence your daily life beyond just the physical aspect, affecting your thinking, empathy, and overall balance. This is due to the holistic approach of Taoism, which Tai Chi is deeply rooted in.

3. **Philosophical Exploration**: The philosophies within your support group should be open and enriching, helping you comprehend more aspects of life and cultivate new virtues.

4. **Research Interests**: Dr. Andrew Newberg wishes he had a TARDIS (like in "Dr. Who") to explore all the areas of research he's interested in, given the vast amount of knowledge he wants to absorb. He mentions that he's currently reading around 30 books at a time, which is a skill he's honed over three decades but doesn't necessarily recommend for beginners.

5. **Areas of Interest**: Dr. Newberg is particularly interested in learning more about neuroscience and cultural anthropology, including the study of Taoism, Buddhism, Christianity, Stoicism, as well as Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, Vedanta, shamanism, and indigenous cultures, where he acknowledges his knowledge gaps.

6. **Future Research**: He is keen to explore more deeply into the hard sciences of neuroscience and the cultural aspects of different societies, seeing these as areas where he needs to expand his understanding.
