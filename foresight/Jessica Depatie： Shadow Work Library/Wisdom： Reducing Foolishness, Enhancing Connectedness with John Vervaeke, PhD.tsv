0	25920	my name is John Rovicki perfect okay John so would you tell us a little bit
25920	31760	about what you do for a living what is your life's work the main thing I guess
31760	38160	is I have sort of two things I'm doing one is I'm a bona fide academic I'm an
38160	42640	associate professor at the University of Toronto in cognitive psychology and
42640	47080	cognitive science so I study the nature of cognition how we learn solve
47080	52200	problems I also study related phenomena like wisdom meaning in life
52200	56400	consciousness mindfulness altered states of consciousness mystical
56400	61040	experiences and so that's something I've been studying as a long time as an
61040	65080	academic I'm also a longtime practitioner I been practicing meditation
65080	70840	contemplation Tai Chi Chuan for like 30 years so that's one thing I'm doing and
70840	78160	then starting I guess about was it 2019 I started an online presence I did a
78160	82680	video series called awakening from the meaning crisis in which I was
82680	86600	addressing the issue that most people are finding increasingly finding it
86600	91840	increasingly difficult to find meaning in life and to get a framework in which
91840	96520	they can cultivate wisdom or perhaps even an appreciation of the sacred within
96520	101160	a scientific worldview and then I've been doing a lot of series around that and
101160	105120	trying to get those two things those two aspects of my life thankfully are
105120	108880	mutually supportive and to try and get them even better coordinated to try and
108880	114680	address the meaning crisis that I mentioned great what is it about your
114680	119600	personality or even the events that have happened in your past life that got
119600	125120	you interested in all these different things well that's a really good question
125120	132720	and so for me the the pivotal moment or at least the pivotal episode perhaps it's
132720	136880	a better way of putting it I was brought up in a fundamentalist Christian
136880	142140	family and of course I love my family this is extended family and so I'm not
142140	149200	trying to criticize them as people but I found I guess given my personality my
149200	154120	own line of psychosocial development that I found that experience ultimately
154120	159480	traumatizing it really had a sort of profound negative impact on me but it
159480	165120	is very sort of bivalent for me because your first religion well we have this
165120	169320	term your mother tongue the first language you you you learn is with you
169320	173280	always and it informs everything else well you can you sort of have like a
173280	178800	mother religion too and so it left the taste in my mouth if I can put it that
178800	183160	way for transcendence and for seeking deeper connection and meaning in a sense
183160	188200	for the sacred dimension to reality but at the same time I was traumatized by
188200	193760	the existing religion and then I was I basically set out on this path to try
193760	198760	and resolve that sort of meaning crisis I was experiencing myself and when I was
198760	202240	in university I encountered the figure of Socrates in the cultivation of wisdom
202240	207840	and this opened up an avenue for me and so from there I started going down the
207840	214600	road but the academic study of wisdom it drops off the table after like first
214600	219480	year university even within philosophy which is ironic given that the love of
219480	224680	wisdom is literally what philosophy means now I went on to studies philosophy
224680	228600	because I valued the sort of meta science and medical to critique and the
228600	233560	tools it was giving but that hunger for wisdom and transcendence was missing and
233560	238080	so I started I went to a place and I started learning Tai Chi Chuan and
238080	243560	meditation and contemplation and then that started to really satisfy that
243600	252640	hunger for wisdom and transcendence but for me as I was doing this right the
252640	257440	cognitive science world was starting to move more and more towards these topics
257440	262840	and when I started to talk about these topics within my academic courses at
262840	267040	the university I was noticing that they were really catching with the students
267040	270640	these were the things they were like getting really fascinated in I think it
270640	273440	was the first person at the University of Toronto to start talking about my
273480	277080	mindfulness within a scientific perspective and then they started asking
277080	282120	me to teach the courses on meditation contemplation extracurricular and I did
282120	288360	that for a long time and so I noticed this confluence and I noticed that many
288360	292920	of my students were resonating with that confluence and so I started to do more
292920	297640	and more about building that bridge the bridge between science and spirituality
297640	299640	to address the meeting crisis
299640	303040	I really resonate with that on a personal level I always thought that that's what
303040	308640	college was supposed to be like and you expand you have these transcended experiences
308640	310640	but not that for me.
310640	320200	And your case is not by any means unique many of the students after sorry this
320200	324120	isn't meant to be self-promotional but many students after they're taking the
324120	327560	classes with me they will say something like that this is what I wanted
327560	331800	University to be and I don't know why the other courses aren't like that so
331800	337400	yeah very much there's a there's a need that's not being met right now now to be
337400	340560	fair there's a lot of other people like me doing this kind of work and one of the
340560	346160	advantages gifts of doing my series was I've got I've been able to meet them and
346160	349160	started interacting with them.
349160	354160	You had mentioned meditation and contemplation. Now meditation is something that many people are
354160	360160	familiar with whether they do it correctly or not but contemplation is a
360160	364160	word that you don't hear too often and I was wondering if you could explain a little bit about that.
364160	369160	This goes right towards my academic work but it also is something that I use
369160	372760	when I'm trying to train I talk about two languages we you have to coordinate
372760	376260	there's a language of explaining which you'd use in science and then there's a
376260	379160	language of training which you're using when people are trying to cultivate
379160	383560	things so let me let's not talk initially about meditation and contemplation
383560	388360	let's talk about their common root in attention and so what I want you to notice
388360	393360	is that your attention is we have a sort of a like a spotlight model of
393360	397260	attention that what we do is shine our attention and on something that makes it
397260	402200	stand out and that's right in so far as attention changes how things stand out
402200	406800	for you how salient they are but there's a lot more going on so for one thing one
406800	410160	of the things you can do with your attention is you can focus on me as a
410160	415880	whole gestalt or you can zoom in to a feature and you go back and forth and
415880	420440	that's dynamic you're constantly doing it because of what Marlo Ponte called an
420440	423560	optimal grip like you're constantly like it when you're looking at my hand
423560	427560	depends what your what your goal is whether or not you focus like let's say
427560	430920	if you wanted to see if I was married you might look at the ring finger but if
430920	433840	you want to see if I worked with my hands a lot you might go more gestalt
433840	438560	like you're gonna move in and out until you get the balance between detail and
438560	441720	the whole and you're constantly doing that with your attention gestalt and
441720	446240	feature so you're constantly doing that but there's another thing you can do
446240	452720	and let me use an analogy for that it's one that's become a somewhat of a mean
452720	457400	for my work but it's still good maybe that's why it became a mean and so I
457400	463760	use this when I'm teaching also my students meditation and I want you to
463760	468540	notice something think about my glasses my glasses are literally framing my
468540	472780	experience there's right and I'm looking through them in both senses of the
472780	478020	word I'm looking past them and by means of them now so right now my glasses are
478020	483540	actually transparent to me but I can do this sometimes I have to step back and
483540	488460	look at my glasses rather than looking right through them so now my glasses are
488460	492380	opaque and why would I do that because I might want to clear some gunk off on my
492380	500660	glasses right you're always mentally framing so your mind you're not at most
500660	504340	the time looking at your mind you're looking through your mind at the world
504340	509500	and you're framing it in terms of what you're focusing in on as salient what
509500	513620	you're focusing in on as relevant what your backgrounding and foregrounding do
513620	516580	you see how dynamic it is like soon as you and it's been it's constantly
516580	520700	shifting it's like this I call it a shifting salience landscape so you're
520700	527700	constantly doing that now just like your glasses are transparent to you and you
527700	532340	might not notice how they're distorting your vision your mental framing can be
532340	536020	transparent to you and you're not noticed and what you do in meditation is you
536020	540940	first learn to step back and look at your mental framing rather than looking
540940	545420	through it this is really what's meant by centering your attention it doesn't
545420	549540	mean just focusing it's you're stepping back and looking at and you also are
549540	554900	trying to break up the Gestalt patterns into the feature details right so
554900	558420	you're stepping back and looking at the mind right and then instead of just
558420	561900	gestalting you're also going in and trying to break up the features notice
561900	566300	the patterns and processes that are going on because you're trying to see how
566300	570660	that might be distorting now think about this that's a valuable thing to do in
570660	573740	meditation but what would you need to do in order to see if you've actually
573900	579500	cleaned your glasses what would you need to do wow no because what I would
579500	588300	think you'd do first is put them on and see if you see differently right that's
588300	592700	what contemplation is contemplation is going the other way it's trying to look
592700	599620	more deeply into reality and to grab the the big picture the Gestalt and to see
599900	604860	if you can seem better than you could before that's contemplation the word
604860	609100	contemplation you can hear the word temple in contemplation temple means to
609100	615260	to look out to look up to the sky the Latin contemplatio is a translation of
615260	619140	the Greek word theoria which means to look deeply it's where we get our word
619140	623260	theory from to look deeply into things and so what you have to do is you
623260	626620	actually have to cycle between these you have to step back and see if it's
626620	631020	distorting you make changes and see if that makes a difference in how you see
631020	635020	the world and if you see the world and you start to see how more how it really
635020	639620	is that guides you in saying oh I bet this is distorting my vision and then
639620	644060	you see what you do you cycle back and forth between meditation and
644060	648180	contemplation one of my criticisms of how the West is appropriating or
648180	653500	misappropriating mindfulness traditions is they tend to only concentrate on one
653580	659100	of these typically meditation if you look at the ecology of practices what in
659100	662940	cultures where the mindful these mindfulness practices are more
662940	666700	indigenous what you find is people have a whole set of practices they have
666700	671620	meditative practices contemplative practices moving practices and
671620	675580	interpersonal social practices because you need to be cultivating them all
675580	680740	together because they act like checks and balances on each other
681180	686740	that's great I want to step back a bit and talk about the state of the world
686740	692220	right now so we can for sure cover why this is important so we all know we're
692220	696780	living in an interesting time it seems cordial but it's stressful it can be
696780	700900	stressful people are on edge there's a lot going on you can see that with
700900	709860	suicide rates last couple of years and I was wondering
710660	718180	a leading question why you think the reason for that is so in science you
718180	721700	you find things that seem disconnected and you do what's called an inference
721700	725820	to the best explanation you try and come up with the best explanation for all of
725820	729180	these disconnected things that unites them together that's how you afford
729180	733940	understanding so I have a proposal in that sense I think it's a theory that's
733940	739580	born out by evidence that a lot of these that you can see a lot of what I call
739620	744300	symptoms almost like the way a doctor looks at various things and through
744300	748380	them sees an underlying disease I call them symptoms of the meeting crisis this
748380	754380	goes to work I did with Christopher Mastipriaccio Philip Misovic and the
754380	765500	idea is that you can see a lot of markers of distress as negative symptoms
765500	768940	you can also see a lot of markers of positive response and you can give a
768940	773020	unified explanation of this in terms of how people are responding to the
773020	777660	meeting crisis either in a malfunction a way or in a functional way so as you
777660	783460	already mentioned you know suicide especially among the younger generations
783460	787980	and going out child suicide is now becoming an issue which is a that's a
787980	792460	profound marker that something's going wrong interestingly Tatiana
792500	798820	shell has Chanel has got provided good evidence that there's a direct line
798820	802180	between a sense of loss of meaning and suicide that doesn't have to pass through
802180	806540	clinical depression so we used to think people are clinically depressed and they
806540	810780	sort of sense meaninglessness or meaninglessness try triggers clinical
810780	815020	depression and that leads to suicide but it looks like no people can go directly
815020	820420	from the sense of meaninglessness into suicide there was a survey in Great
820460	825060	Britain I think it was 2017 something like 89% of the adult survey thought
825060	830740	their lives were meaningless and there's overwhelming evidence that that is
830740	835020	predictive of a lot of things going wrong the survey also showed another
835020	839260	symptom of the meaning crisis a loneliness epidemic right as you
839260	844820	mentioned a mental health epidemic we're getting you know rise mark you know rise
845580	850660	we're getting an increase in the markers for depression measurements of
850660	855980	depression anxiety disorders related we're getting various addiction crises
855980	862060	the opioid crisis so these are all markers of this meaning crisis you get
862060	869180	the the rise it's funny I was actually interviewed by rebel wisdom just at the
869220	875060	beginning of COVID and I was predicting a rise in what Jules Evans calls he
875060	879420	resurrected the term conspirituality which is a mixture of conspiracy theories
879420	885420	and spirituality practices like QAnon and things like that and you see that as
885420	892740	another marker but you also see some positive responses you see the rise
900020	903740	of and we've talked about it already although I have some criticisms of it
903740	908460	but you see the rise of the mindfulness movement as an attempt to respond to that
908460	914660	you see the rise of Hellenistic philosophies like stoicism is going
914660	920140	through this huge revival that you see the attempts to import Buddhism and
920140	927500	stoicism Buddhism and Taoism into the West in order and you see the emergence
927780	932460	and I get to be involved with these people of new communities Rafe Kelly's
932460	936540	evolved move play where people are integrated he does where he takes
936540	941700	people out into the woods and they do parkour right and then they do mindfulness
941700	945660	and they do martial arts and then they do campfire discourse where people are
945660	950540	doing all of this to try and enhance meaning in life so this whole like that
950540	954540	would look sort of chaotic and disparate but if you pause it that all of this can
954580	960740	be seen as a response to a profound sense of loss of meaning or meaning being
960740	964820	under threat meaning in life then you can explain all of those in terms of this
964820	971140	idea of the meaning crisis and so I would suggest that the reason why a lot of
971140	976940	people are under stress right now and pursuing various strategies to try and
976940	980620	intensify meaning is exactly that meaning crisis
985300	991220	well I did 25 hours of lecture on the awakening for the meaning crisis to try
991220	996420	and give an answer to that question so I will do my best to try and collapse that
996420	1003260	into a couple of minutes of a response there's two basic dimensions to
1003260	1007340	answering a question that are really important one is a structural dimension
1007340	1011460	what is meaning what are we talking about and why does it come under threat
1011460	1016140	why is it at risk and then the second is a historical so let me talk about the
1016140	1020420	first because I need the first to explain the second so here's the basic idea
1020420	1026100	and this is this this for me is this is where I'm placing all my epistemic and
1026100	1032020	career bets because for me this is this is the lich pin which is the centrality
1032020	1041100	of meaning so it goes like this you are a cognitive agent you can move in many
1041140	1045540	domains and solve many problems within many domains you're really really
1045540	1048820	interesting and I don't mean to make you sound like a specimen but I find that
1048820	1054660	so fascinating about human beings that they have this capacity and what's what
1054660	1058100	that what seems to be I would argue and what I published on at the core of this
1058100	1063900	is this really unique ability we have and which and why it strikes me is so
1063900	1067700	unique it's the thing we're trying to give artificial intelligence and we
1067740	1070980	haven't figured out how to do it and we're this is this is the although we're
1070980	1075220	making progress so I want you to notice that you're doing it right now and it
1075220	1078420	goes back to that salience landscaping I was talking about so the amount of
1078420	1082060	information that's actually available to you in the technical definition of
1082060	1088220	information is combinatorial explosive it's astronomically vast do you know
1088220	1091220	the amount of information you have in your long-term memory all the possible
1091220	1096100	combinations connections you could make astronomically vast you know all the
1096100	1101500	sequences of behavior you could put together astronomically vast but you
1101500	1105060	know what you're doing right now out of all of the information out there all the
1105060	1108780	information in here and all the possibilities of how you could behave
1108780	1116180	you're zeroing in on the relevant information like that like that how do
1116180	1121620	you do it it's a really hard question I dedicated my life to trying to figure it
1121620	1127620	out now think about how you need that moment by moment by moment and no
1127620	1130780	one has said it's not static you're constantly shifting and notice what's
1130780	1135260	going on even right and this gives you a bit of a clue I would argue as to how
1135260	1139980	you're doing it part of your mind is trying to select and focus in and part
1139980	1143540	of your mind wants to wander off and think about other things and so part of
1143540	1147420	your mind is trying to open up possibilities and then another part is
1147460	1151260	selecting from all those possibilities right and it's doing this and that's
1151260	1155460	just like the process of evolution you have variation and selection variation
1155460	1159580	and selection so notice what that does it makes certain things about me and what
1159580	1164620	I'm saying stand out and other things you don't even consider them now that's
1164620	1169340	that's what's so cool this sounds like a Zen coin you know what makes you
1169340	1173660	intelligent your ability to ignore most of the information that's available to
1173660	1178540	you so what you're doing and this is a very technical sense is you're
1178540	1184460	biasing your attention that's how you're intelligent but you pay a price for
1184460	1191300	that you're biasing your attention and there's check there's are you're always
1191300	1196940	always subject to this vulnerability that that bias is going to turn out to be a
1196940	1201580	prejudice that you actually missed the information you needed every year until
1201580	1205420	very recently because phones have made this go down but until the advent of
1205420	1209860	cell phones this would regularly happen people would go into a dark place where
1209860	1213300	they knew there was flammable gas dispersed and they knew they needed light
1213300	1216940	so they would strike a match and what were they focusing on what was relevant
1216940	1220900	to them is that the match is a source of light and what they ignored was a match
1220900	1226780	is also a source of heat and they would blow themselves up right so we are
1226780	1232860	always sub so the very processes these evolving dynamic processes that make us
1232860	1239620	intelligent also make us perpetually susceptible to self-deception self
1239620	1243660	destructive self-deception and we're doing it all the time a great place
1243660	1248340	people realize this is in the romantic lives I say oh I know what I did wrong
1248340	1251300	there I'm gonna do the exact opposite with this person and then they get into
1251300	1255860	it and they go oh I'm doing it again I'm doing the same thing again although it's
1255900	1261260	very hard for them to see it from the inside so across cultures across
1261260	1268460	historical context people have developed ecologies of practices for interacting
1268460	1274220	with this dynamic self-evolving relevance realization in order to try and
1274220	1278780	ameliorate the foolishness that self-deceptive self-destructive behavior
1278780	1285540	but there's a positive side because this is so central to you when people talk
1285580	1289060	about feeling connected that's what they're talking about they're talking
1289060	1292580	about that relevance realization it's relevant to me it's salient to me it
1292580	1297060	draws me in relevance is always about what you're caring about as opposed to
1297060	1301460	what you're ignoring and so people also not only do they need to ameliorate the
1301460	1305940	foolishness they want to enhance the connectedness so they also have
1305940	1310580	ecologies of practices that not only ameliorate the foolishness but enhance
1310580	1314620	the connectedness that connectedness is what meaning in life is
1314620	1320660	ameliorating foolishness enhancing connectedness enhancing meaning in life
1320660	1325940	that's wisdom this is what I do with my students so that's the structural
1325940	1331380	problem we need wisdom it's not optional for us to ignore it right and if you ask
1331380	1336460	people do you want to be wiser they usually say well yeah of course do you
1336460	1339900	want more meaning yeah do you want to be less self-deceptive self-destructive
1339900	1344380	yeah but I'll ask my students I'll say where do you go for information oh
1344380	1348420	social media the internet where do you go for knowledge a little bit slower
1348420	1354700	science the universities then I'll say where do you go for wisdom and there's
1354700	1361340	a silence some of them a little bit a shrinking minority will say maybe my
1361380	1366780	religion but they're not very confident about that and that is the historical
1366780	1372660	issue these ecologies of practices in which we cultivate wisdom have to be
1372660	1377260	situated into a worldview that homes them that valorizes them that provides
1377260	1382020	institutions and communities when I asked you what would you do you said I'd
1382020	1386140	ask somebody if there was gunk on my glasses somebody else that's right we
1386140	1390900	need a community transformation requires community it requires and a community
1390940	1394980	requires a shared worldview and it requires right so you got a shared
1394980	1399260	worldview a community an ecology of practices that's what religion provided
1399260	1407820	and what we see historically for a lot of reasons is that is the decline the
1407820	1413180	loss of what Peter Burger calls our sacred canopy I'm not advocating for
1413180	1418540	Christianity I'm not doing that but what I'm saying is when we lost it for what
1418540	1423620	the political and metaphysical and scientific reasons that we lost it we
1423620	1428020	lost all of the functionality it provided for us in the cultivation of
1428020	1433460	wisdom and meaning and here's the problem for us the scientific worldview and
1433460	1437820	let's let I want you to remember I'm a scientist I love science but the
1437820	1445660	scientific worldview can't address that problem and here's here's what I mean the
1445660	1450580	scientific worldview has no explanation for science itself or for the
1450580	1455660	meaning-making practices of the scientists that make science possible we
1455660	1462180	and our science don't actually fit in to the scientific worldview we're a whole a
1462180	1468300	gap but like a black hole within that worldview and so the very thing that is
1468300	1474460	so successful so beautifully successful in so many domains is precisely
1474460	1484300	incapable of addressing this historical loss of a worldview that homes wisdom
1484300	1488860	and meaning I'm glad you brought that up because I did want to ask you being a part
1488860	1495140	of the scientific community can mimic a spiritual community it seems like there
1495140	1501980	is a religion of science happening also there can be and then there even been
1502020	1510500	historical attempts like Auguste Comte to try and do that and there are I mean
1510500	1514820	one of the things you see in the history of the West is as Christianity
1514820	1519900	receded you get you get the attempt to fill in that vacuum with pseudo-religious
1519900	1525340	ideologies political movements you know I would recommend very strongly that
1525340	1530100	people consider that communism and Nazism are not just political phenomena
1530140	1535620	they're also pseudo-religious phenomena in a profound way and so I mean and
1535620	1539260	there's various ideologies left and right that people use and you can see
1539260	1544220	various academic communities trying to plug in the sense of the sacred into
1544220	1548820	the science by sort of fusing you know a particular political worldview
1548820	1554940	liberalism or leftism or right right wingism whatever right to try and do
1554940	1560780	that because science per se can't do that the attempt to turn science into
1560780	1567300	religious framework with some people called scientism you see it happening
1567300	1571260	with the with the academic community but on on its own science really can't do
1571260	1576740	that much so it's usually glued together with a not scientifically based
1576740	1584460	allegiance to a particular socio-political economic ideological vision of what the
1584460	1588940	good life is and what good people are and what's the good what's the good
1588940	1593940	future that we should be pursuing and things like that so we're talking about
1593940	1597780	science and spirituality and one of your passions for bringing them closer
1597780	1602260	together one of the things you'd mentioned on your first episode of your
1602260	1607500	series is the different types of knowing and yeah for me like I think people
1607500	1610980	need to know about that would you mind going through thank you for bringing that
1611020	1616380	up because that that goes exactly towards the kind of bridging that's a
1616380	1624540	wonderful question I deeply appreciate that and it's it's funny you're and I
1624540	1631020	don't mean this in any way to denigrate my my two boys who are like the jewels
1631020	1635140	of my life but your theories are kind of like your children and you don't know
1635140	1638540	which and you when you don't know which one of these is going to take off and
1638580	1642060	it's really interesting that this has been something that really that people
1642060	1646700	have found very central so the idea is and this is one of the ways in which
1646700	1652860	science is inadequate the idea is that there's four kinds of knowing and let's
1652860	1656420	start with the one that's typified in science and that's prevalent in our
1656420	1660540	culture especially in ideological movements which is propositional knowing
1660540	1667100	so this is knowing that you you practice you practice this knowing by
1667100	1671460	asserting propositions you say things like I believe that the earth is round
1671460	1677660	that's a proposition and I believe it and what I do is I gather evidence for
1677660	1681580	that particular proposition and if the evidence is enough I start to talk about
1681580	1684740	and it gives me explanatory power I start talking about a theory and I get a
1684740	1688980	sense of a conviction a sense of conviction that it's true and of course
1688980	1693420	ideologies make those same kinds of moves that's propositional knowing and for a
1693700	1698420	very long time because of the scientific revolution and Descartes and because also
1698420	1702980	of things going on in the Protestant Reformation we have started to think
1702980	1707580	that that's all knowing is just propositional knowing and we've done
1707580	1711420	we've done similar reductions we've reduced faith to belief we treat them
1711420	1714540	as if they're synonyms and we think that the most important thing for
1714540	1718940	explaining somebody's behavior are their beliefs and so we get this massive
1718940	1724540	reduction now what's happened in the cognitive science that I'm privileged
1724540	1730060	to participate in there's been a revolution going on in the last you
1730060	1733820	know 30 40 years it's called for e-cognitive science we can get into
1733820	1739940	that at some point if you want but the main idea is I draw from that is that
1739940	1744860	there are other kinds of knowing so there's procedural which isn't knowing
1744860	1748500	that something is it the case it's knowing how to do something it's knowing
1748500	1753020	how to catch a ball it's knowing how to kiss somebody right which isn't the same
1753020	1758020	thing as having a bunch of beliefs about kissing that's why you could read a lot
1758020	1760980	of books on kissing and it wouldn't make you a good kisser wouldn't make you a
1760980	1766300	good martial artist it can help but it's not it's nowhere near enough knowing
1766300	1770140	how has a lot more to do not with theories it has to do with skills about
1770140	1775180	how to right build up sensory motor patterns of interaction with the world
1775220	1778980	and and the sense of realness there isn't the sense of truth it's a sense of
1778980	1783940	power like when you have a skill you have expertise and that's why you give
1783940	1787860	authority to a doctor because they have a sense of skills obviously they have
1787860	1790740	beliefs but if they had the beliefs without the skills would you go to the
1790740	1795620	doctor no way right so that's procedural knowing it's knowing how
1795620	1799780	interestingly the forms of memory associated with the two kinds of
1799780	1804060	knowing are distinct your semantic memory your memory of facts is distinct
1804100	1807300	from your procedural memory your knowledge of skills so you can lose one
1807300	1814380	without losing the other so now related to that is another one which is think of
1814380	1819780	what you need for your skills you need what's called situational awareness so
1819780	1823060	is your skill of swimming relevant right now should you activate it should you
1823060	1828300	get you start swim now because it's not relevant here I mean if the room
1828300	1832940	suddenly flooded with water it could be so you need situational awareness to
1832940	1838180	tell you which skills to activate which skills you might need to acquire right
1838180	1843060	so what's the situational awareness what kind of knowing is that well this is
1843060	1847380	knowing what it's like to be here right now the here nowness so this is member I
1847380	1852500	mentioned it this is your knowing by salience landscaping how are you salience
1852500	1856980	landscaping how are you sizing up this situation right what's your state of mind
1856980	1861700	right so you have this this episodic memory which is a combination of your
1861700	1864900	state of mind in this situation so think of the difference in your memory
1864900	1868300	between remembering that two plus two equals four and your memory of your
1868300	1874980	last birthday one is just this fact that just hangs out the other is you recall
1874980	1879780	the situation a scene what stands out what's foregrounded what's backgrounded
1879780	1883980	and you recall your corresponding and co-determining state of mind so you
1883980	1889620	recall your perspective this is perspectival knowing now its sense of
1889620	1894660	realness isn't the conviction of truth or power we know what it is because and I
1894660	1898620	do work on this just published some papers on it with Dan Schiappi right in
1898620	1902620	terms of virtual reality so what are people looking for that they want the
1902620	1907420	game to be real what are they looking for it's called a sense of presence so
1907420	1910620	that perspectival knowing gives you a sense of realness when you have a sense
1910620	1916380	that you're really here really now really connected really present it's a sense of
1916380	1923220	presence as a realness okay what's under that what's under that is you don't come
1923220	1927780	into this situation as a blank slate contrary to what John Locke said you
1927780	1932460	come in with your biology your biological evolutionary heritage and your
1932460	1937020	culture shaping you and the environment to fit each other this chair is
1937020	1940980	suitable for me I can sit on it that's an affordance it affords sitting it
1940980	1945180	wouldn't afford sitting for an elephant right this glass this glass is
1945180	1950020	graspable by me evolution has shaped me to pick up objects like this and then
1950020	1954620	culture has taught me to shape my hand this way and and made objects that fit
1954620	1960100	my hand so this if this for me this is graspable the graspability is not in the
1960100	1964380	glass it's not in my hand but in the way my hand and the glass have been shaped
1964380	1969820	to each other by evolution and by culture and by my ongoing state of mind
1969820	1974580	this is an idea from Gibson and it's at the core of 40 cognitive science right
1975140	1981620	that you have right the way though you and your environment are co-shaping each
1981620	1986260	other and opening up a whole network of affordances that are available to you
1986260	1990460	for interacting with the world this is your participatory knowing this is your
1990460	1994860	knowing by being this is the relationship between your agency and how the world is
1994860	2000620	disclosed to you as an arena for action and they're mutually belonging together
2000900	2006100	now you have semantic memory for propositional knowing you have procedural
2006100	2009740	memory right for procedural knowing you have episodic memory for
2009740	2014020	perspective knowing what kind of memory do you have for this participatory
2014020	2019860	belonging in the world a profound kind of memory you call yourself your sense
2019860	2025140	of self your sense of identity this is the deep kind of memory a deep kind of
2025140	2030780	knowing so when you know something by binding yourself to it perhaps the way
2030780	2035580	you should know your partner right so your self-knowledge and your knowledge
2035580	2040620	of your partner are bound up together and they co-evolve and they shape each
2040620	2046700	other right and the two people right more and more conform to each other and
2046700	2053220	afford each other's transformation so you know love is the the medieval's had
2053220	2056620	this that love is its own way of knowing love is a primary example of
2056620	2060180	participatory knowing the kind of knowing that you can only have by loving
2060180	2066260	something right so the participatory knowing sets out the affordances the
2066260	2070220	perspective of knowing makes certain affordances salient and stand out so
2070220	2073620	it and then that activates what skills you're going to bring into the
2073620	2077020	interaction and then as you're interacting you bring out the facts
2077020	2082020	that are relevant to your interaction and that's how they all work so the
2082020	2086380	scientific worldview locks us here in the propositional and most of that
2086380	2091580	relevance realization that connectedness is happening on at the levels of the
2091580	2096060	non propositional knowing this is another profound reason why science
2096060	2101900	qua science can't give us the meaning now what science can do is give us the
2101900	2106140	science of those kinds of knowing so that we can better engineer the
2106140	2111420	psychotechnologies the practices that will enhance them that will make them
2111420	2118860	wiser and more meaningful enhance that connectedness so this is taking me to
2118860	2123300	altered states of consciousness I would love to talk about that of course you
2123300	2131700	should I think that so many of us are stuck focusing on the wrong things or
2131700	2138620	just at least very narrow things on our TV screens social media and the few
2138620	2146220	people that we have in our very small circles now how do you feel that how do
2146220	2149420	you feel altered states of consciousness fall into helping us with this
2149420	2155260	meaning so that is also a really profound question and I would I would
2155260	2159700	suggest to you that the renaissance of interest in psychedelics both
2159700	2164580	academically and culturally is another symptomatic response to the meaning
2164580	2171140	crisis people are craving enhanced connectedness the kind of union and
2171140	2176540	self-transcendence and as you said they're trying to break out of too narrow
2176540	2181020	of framing on reality and that's why they're seeking them out and of course
2181020	2184980	there's been a you know cross cultures cross history a long-standing
2184980	2189980	connection between psychedelics and mystical experience so they're not the
2189980	2197580	same but and and the cultivation of wisdom so we have to be very cautious
2197580	2205820	about this because we have the very thing that the very reason why people and
2205820	2211180	this is almost ironic the very reason why people might take psychedelics is the
2211180	2216500	kind of misframing they could bring to the psychedelics which is they could get
2216540	2226140	too focused and too narrow a framing of this psychedelic experience so altered
2226140	2229340	states of consciousness psychedelic experience mystical experience one of
2229340	2235820	the ways of thinking about them one of the ways I've been arguing up with lots
2235820	2239980	of people like Dana Craig and others we've been working on this idea Jensen
2239980	2248980	Kim a bunch of people is I want you to remember an experience that probably
2248980	2255060	happens to you every day and I want to use that and put it on a continuum with
2255060	2261140	altered states so you've had an aha moment can you remember one recently
2261140	2266380	where you realized oh I'm looking at this in completely the wrong way at that
2266380	2270820	aha experience where you've been thinking about something you're right I
2270820	2274660	should think about it this way I was the wrong I was concentrating on the wrong
2274660	2277940	thing the fact that you asked me that question means you've had that experience
2277940	2282460	so I study this I study is called insight and notice what it means to see
2282460	2288380	a to see into something right so what's happening in an insight experience notice
2288380	2293420	that we often talk about it like a flash of insight what's happening is your
2293460	2298260	salience landscape is suddenly shifting often they'll represented in movies with
2298260	2301780	things coming in and out of the foreground of the background right so
2301780	2306780	what's happening is a very dynamic reconfiguration of your salience
2306780	2313140	landscape right so you ask people well what grows from an acorn and oak what's
2313140	2319420	this stroke what's the gray stuff that comes off fire smoke what's the white of
2319420	2326260	an egg called and people say the yolk and you were gonna say right but the
2326260	2330260	answer is the white of the egg but what were you doing you were concentrating on
2330260	2334540	the oak sound you foregrounded that as relevant and then so you looked for the
2334540	2339300	part of the egg that has the oak sound in it you said yolk and then you laughed
2339300	2342820	because humor is related to insight because you realized that you had
2343140	2351260	misframed the situation okay now we are doing that all the time because like I
2351260	2355860	said the relevance realization process is constantly evolving and sometimes
2355860	2360980	though that evolution goes through this dynamic shift of self-correction this is
2360980	2365820	why insight is so associated with wisdom if you ask people could somebody be not
2365820	2369460	that educated but really wise they go yeah I think so what if they weren't very
2369500	2373820	artistic could they be wise yeah I think so could they be not very insightful and
2373820	2377860	wise they go no they got to be insightful to be wise there's a deep
2377860	2382820	connection there because they realize that insight is a little micro moment of
2382820	2387060	increased wisdom it's a little moment of self-transcendence it's a little moment
2387060	2390060	when you're breaking out of that narrow frame and you've got a moment when you
2390060	2394100	realized oh I was looking at it the wrong way now what I want you to consider is
2394260	2400340	that capacity for self-transcendence self-correction right and it comes with a
2400340	2405300	change in consciousness there's a flash it's on a continuum so if you get a
2405300	2408620	bunch of these insights at least that's what I published with Leo Ferrero and
2408620	2413260	Erin Herobinat in 2018 and you start chaining them together so an insight
2413260	2416300	leads to another insight leads to another insight like think about somebody
2416300	2419380	playing jazz they're playing jazz and they pick up and they break frame and
2419380	2422300	make a new frame and then they have to break the frame and make and they're
2422300	2426500	constantly they get into what's called the flow state athletes seek this out
2426500	2428900	because it's optimal you're at your very best and it feels like the most
2428900	2433300	amazing experience like in your act right so you're in the zone and I get it
2433300	2436580	like as a martial artist I get it when I'm lecturing and notice what people say
2436580	2442100	it's like they now talk about the whole world being super salient they feel that
2442100	2446620	one with their environment they feel deeply connected that's that enhanced
2446620	2450860	meaning right and flow states is when they start to feel like they're they
2450940	2455100	have that really deep connectedness but they're self-transcending they report a
2455100	2459180	loss of self-consciousness my consciousness you know that mattering
2459180	2464420	narrative nanny in your head how do I look how are people thinking of me what's
2464420	2469940	going on do they like me all of that all of that goes away because they're so at
2469940	2472660	one and like when you're a martial artist like if you're sparring in your
2472660	2477420	in your flow like it's so amazing you know at one level you're making all this
2477460	2481660	effort but your hand just goes for the block and you just find the opening for
2481660	2488220	the punch right or right or it's so that's the flow state notice how that's
2488220	2491900	already a profound altered state of consciousness now one of the interesting
2491900	2496140	features about flow Chikset Mahai has studied this for decades is it's a
2496140	2501780	universal it happens to people regardless of their gender their socio-economic
2501780	2507820	status their language their cultural background across all of this people
2507820	2512060	describe the flow experience in almost the same light the same terms of the
2512060	2516780	same level of detail so it's something profound going on because it's enhancing
2516780	2521700	right this this relevance realization this connectedness this capacity for
2521700	2527460	self-transcendence now take flow and its altered state of consciousness and ramp
2527580	2533140	it up instead of flowing as I'm sparring right or as I'm writing poetry or as I'm
2533140	2540180	playing jazz what have I flowed at the level of my grant my relationship to
2540180	2544980	reality as a whole what have I got into a flow state at the level of my world
2544980	2551500	view so I was doing what Blake said I was seeing a world in a grain of sand
2551500	2555300	that everything is interpenetrating and I'm getting this flow that's from the
2555300	2559860	gestalt to the feature and in and out to the center of my psyche out to the
2559860	2564180	depths of the world as a flow experience and imagine how that's going to
2564180	2569580	transform your salience landscaping and how it's going to even more reduce that
2569580	2574380	that self-consciousness it's going to be like a super awe experience those are
2574380	2578020	mystical experiences and then there's an overlap between psychedelic
2578020	2582020	experiences and even lion I just I interviewed him from my one of my
2582020	2585140	channels he's writing a book it's coming out called psychedelic experience
2585140	2588820	and he points out that psychedelic experiences don't have to use substances
2588820	2592900	there's other ways of triggering them and so you got you so you got insight
2592900	2598180	flow psychedelic experiences mystical experiences and then when mystical
2598180	2604180	experiences put people in touch with what they call the really real the most
2604180	2612360	real this is what's so fascinating about it they will transform their lives their
2612360	2618460	roles their relationships often their occupation in order to conform more and
2618460	2623540	more to that really real they'll invert everything so normally what we do is the
2623540	2627580	everyday is the real and anything that's off that's aberrant from that like a
2627580	2632340	dream or when we're drunk we go that's not real people do the opposite in these
2632380	2636180	experience they have these experiences the real really real and they say that's
2636180	2642180	real and all of this is less real and they change their lives because we want
2642180	2648260	to be in touch with what's most real and so altered states of consciousness are
2648260	2655500	are so sought after now because they give us the capacity for enhancing all of
2655500	2659300	that continuum from insight to transformative experience giving us the
2659300	2665700	self-transcendence the opportunity to get profound insight cultivate wisdom and
2665700	2669580	transform our sense of self all the kinds of knowing and so of course we're
2669580	2677660	seeking it but here's the danger here's the danger right if you don't have that
2677660	2681780	situated within an already existing ecology of practices in which you're
2681780	2687500	cultivating wisdom and a community that is giving you a worldview you can spin
2687540	2692660	off you can spin off from these altered states you can go down various rabbit
2692660	2697340	holes you can get into echo chambers you can come up with wacky metaphysics all
2697340	2703700	kinds of strange things happening so and I get into a little bit of trouble not
2703700	2708260	like officially but with the university and also I think I pissed people off a
2708260	2713020	little bit because I say two things and it sounds like contradiction I say we
2713020	2718460	should not prohibit substances doesn't work doesn't work I'm really confident
2718460	2722980	about that doesn't work okay but we should also license the use of them like
2722980	2728060	we do for a car or a handgun these are powerful tools you don't give a five
2728060	2731500	year old a chainsaw you don't give somebody in fact who doesn't know how to
2731500	2735940	use a chainsaw a chainsaw if you're gonna cut through the cords of your life
2735940	2738900	because you're seeking profound transformation you better know how to
2738900	2743420	use that tool right it's called the mind sword in you know in some of the
2743420	2747020	Buddhist traditions you know you better learn like and that's what decisive
2747020	2750700	means by the way it means to cut right if you if you don't know how to wield
2750700	2756020	that properly there's a potential for getting into some very significant
2756020	2762900	self-deceptive self-destructive behavior so I think that if we're cultivating
2762900	2766460	altered states of consciousness through mindfulness practices through movement
2766500	2770860	practices through group practices through the use of substances through
2770860	2775900	breathing techniques that should always be properly situated within a
2775900	2783340	sapiential sacred community I can see the problem with that argument where many
2783340	2788340	things that are licensed start to become really rigid so I'd imagine that the
2788340	2794100	whole licensing process of this look very different than anything else I mean
2794100	2799300	we talk about doulas for example yeah licensing at least in the US for a long
2799300	2805620	time because of that yes about the person and how can you license or restrict
2805620	2810100	how that process goes for each human well we do it for other things so here's my
2810100	2815220	counter example and you know this has become you know the case and there was
2815220	2819380	this discussion around it but we do it with psychotherapy we like it's now the
2819380	2824180	law that you can't practice psychotherapy unless you are approved by the
2824180	2828680	college and the idea here is because we're engaging in something that has the
2828680	2833780	capacity to you know radically transform people and therefore there is a power
2833780	2840180	and we have to make sure that people have both the scientific and the skill and
2840180	2845060	I would even add perhaps the moral training education so that they will
2845060	2850160	wield that power responsibly thank you okay I want to back up to something about
2850160	2857340	insight that it was great that you brought together the humor is human
2857340	2861260	insight somehow go together yes so humor from all the people that we've
2861260	2866180	interviewed so far has come up humor and martial art yes interestingly enough
2866180	2870380	and it was funny I was thinking about the aha moment how it's like a aha moment
2870380	2875060	yeah yeah yeah that's great I like that did you come up with that I have that's
2875060	2883220	beautiful I like that so I was right you can talk a little bit more about humor
2883220	2891380	and how that plays a role oh cognitive science but also very much and one of
2891380	2897380	the things that intrigued me is you know the cross-cultural for study of spiritual
2897380	2900920	traditions that have humor in them Zen has a lot of humor in it and others
2900920	2909260	where the humor is much more much more backgrounded and held down so humor these
2909260	2917180	three things are related humor metaphor and insight and and they don't come
2917180	2921940	naturally to human beings we have to practice it with kids for a long time so
2921940	2927740	try and get a four-year-old to tell a joke they're not very good at it try and
2927740	2931500	get them to understand metaphor they're not very good at it and their insight
2931500	2937660	capacity is also not that explicit to them so one of the ways of thinking about
2937660	2944920	this goes to work that's been really developed well by you McGill
2944920	2949700	Kristen I was privileged to have a conversation with him about but it lines
2949940	2956380	up with work from Cuneas Beeman Bowden a whole bunch of people that they have a
2956380	2960340	book called the Eureka factor having to do with the relationship between the
2960340	2968020	hemispheres so we were talking about like your ability to solve problems and
2968020	2971340	humor is actually making use of the problem-solving ability so I am getting
2971340	2978580	there right now there's two kinds of problems you're facing all the time one
2978580	2983260	is a problem that's very familiar to you it's very well-defined look like a
2983260	2987820	prototypical example is a multiplication problem you know what kind of problem it
2987820	2990740	is you know the actions you're supposed to perform you know when you're doing it
2990740	2993940	right you know when it's doing wrong you know what the results supposed to look
2993940	3000300	like very well-defined problem now compare solving a multiplication
3000300	3006380	problem with going on a successful first date what's the rule there so what's the
3006420	3010820	initial state well you're with some stranger okay what kind of problem is
3010820	3019100	this well what should I do I don't know like when I was dating I remember did
3019100	3023940	the advice my friends would give me was so useless was like look at her eyes but
3023940	3028660	not too much laugh at her jokes but not too often try to be funny but not to ask
3028660	3037380	questions but it's like right and so these are called ill-defined problems
3037380	3044380	and ill-defined problems are pervasive in your environment and what your brain is
3044380	3047660	really struggling to do again the framing is try and convert as many of
3047660	3050540	those ill-defined problems into well-defined problems that you can
3050540	3056540	build up habits and routines for right left hemisphere is about well-defined
3056540	3061740	problems step-by-step narrow focus attention to detail not language that we
3061740	3066140	people say languages in both hemispheres and that's stuff about drawing on the
3066140	3069220	right side of your brain and you have an artist in your right hemisphere and you
3069220	3072860	have some sort of fascist in your left hemisphere that's all ridiculous but the
3072860	3078620	left hemisphere tends to focus on well-defined problems the right tends
3078620	3084180	to focus on ill-defined problems so instead of focusing on detail it reaches
3084180	3088300	for the gestalt so think of like I think of a classic ill-defined problem
3088300	3094020	predator something's attacking you like you don't oh well what kind of predator
3094020	3098820	is it let's get very clear you're dead right so you want to do open up you want
3098820	3103420	to gestalt you it's ill-defined you want some very coarse-grained things you want
3103420	3107700	to grab associations as fast as you can so what typically happens when people
3107700	3112300	come into situations that are very ill-defined is you can see activity
3112300	3119260	being initially predominant in the left of the right hemisphere now what happens
3119260	3123180	in insight is you come to a problem and you think you know how to frame it oh
3123180	3127740	yes I know how to do this the left hemisphere is very dominant and then
3127740	3133860	you realize I don't know how to do this and you'll see the aha moment is when
3133860	3138900	activity shifts from the left to the right and then what happens in the right
3138940	3144380	is in here you're you're you're working within a frame and in here you're going
3144380	3148140	all that frames don't and now you're looking for a frame and then when you
3148140	3151100	get an alternative frame you bring it back you reframe your problem and that
3151100	3160380	that that's aha something else that does that is metaphor metaphor also does
3160380	3167620	that shift so when I say and we notice notice how much your cognition is
3167660	3174140	drenched in metaphor I just did it by the way so you'll say things like we're
3174140	3179540	halfway through this interview halfway way through we're not moving through
3179540	3185140	space the interview I hope it's not too hard John I hope right I hope you're
3185140	3189380	seeing what I'm saying I hope you're getting it I hope you're understanding
3189380	3195940	it I hope you're right to see in fact try to say anything profound and
3195940	3200380	meaningful to somebody without invoking a metaphor because you're trying to
3200380	3204060	afford insight this is the work of lake often Johnson although I have some
3204060	3212020	criticisms of the specifics of their theory okay so metaphor and insight and
3212020	3216900	we use metaphor we use propositional metaphors to try and trigger non-
3216900	3223780	propositional insight so and of course Shakespeare is an exemplar of this
3223980	3233380	humor involves metaphor when it's verbal humor of some kind right and it
3233380	3238300	involves a sudden reframing you have to get the punchline you have to have the
3238300	3243420	aha moment that's why people will often retrospectively see a failure of
3243420	3250980	insight as something funny they'll go oh haha so humor is it like one of the
3250980	3255900	things you're doing when somebody gets a joke right is you're playing with things
3255900	3262140	you know don't live leave alphabet soup on the you know boiling on the stove it
3262140	3269140	could spell disaster okay it's a bad joke but but the point is notice how I'm
3269140	3273020	playing right on two different meanings and moving between them and you got to
3273020	3276740	shift the meaning right you got a reframe you have to have that insight and
3276740	3280740	you do it retrospectively and it alleviates the tension between like
3280740	3284500	there's a there's an initial problem and then you resolve it with insight and you
3284500	3289460	play with sort of the metaphorical aspects of language we've got humor and
3289460	3293580	then with other humor that's non-verbal we're doing sort of something
3293580	3298540	analogously I would argue with like perspectival knowing things like that so
3298540	3305260	humor metaphor insight are bound together and you can see why people who are
3305300	3310740	seeking transformation would rely on them because they're what you're doing is
3310740	3316700	you're trying to fuel and prime the engine of cognitive flexibility of your
3316700	3324140	ability to reframe right and to alter what's salient and relevant to you in a
3324140	3328820	way that connects to you that matters to you that's meaningful to you and of
3328820	3334700	course that's going to help you take ill-defined situations like when
3334740	3340100	something traumatic has happened to us or when some opportunity that's golden
3340100	3344180	has suddenly opened up to us should I get involved with that person should I
3344180	3348620	try that new career we're going to turn to these as a way of trying to enhance
3348620	3352820	our ability to deal with ill-defined situations
3352820	3358460	I need to believe so many people are resistant to taking their glasses off and
3358460	3369860	seeing what's on there because I mean part of it is part of it is cultural we
3369860	3375820	have truncated and reduced people's sense of their mind and their self and
3375820	3382620	those aren't identical but they're related and so we people don't when
3382620	3387740	people don't have the ability to access that cognitive flexibility and when
3387740	3391660	they're in a meaning scarcity this is called scarcity mentality when human
3391660	3397140	beings face any significant scarcity of food water of you know friendship
3397140	3401940	relationship meaning they become very rigid they become very narrow they become
3401940	3408700	very short-term in their thinking this is why you know sort of you know blaming
3408700	3412860	people for bad behavior because they're poor is is perhaps getting things the
3412860	3418380	wrong way around right instead right you think of people in scarcity so if we've
3418380	3422420	taken all of the meaning and wisdom machinery away and we've really reduced
3422420	3426500	people's sense of what they're what they are you are your beliefs and they're
3426540	3432740	shrunk down here and they're starving of course they're going to be resistant to
3432740	3437300	taking their glasses off they're going to be rigid and resistant and they're in
3437300	3444380	fact they're going to double down on holding on to the beliefs with which
3444380	3450140	they identify if you feel comfortable talking about this I'm not sure if this
3450140	3457340	is your area of expertise so rebel wisdom yes they talk about sense-making yes
3457340	3464380	sense-making and meaning making what's the relationship between them so they're
3464380	3468980	they're they're they overlap to a great degree so sense-making was a term coined
3468980	3475340	I think I believe by maybe it was O'Shamel but it was made prominent by
3475340	3480620	Francisco Varela who is one of the pioneers of 4e cognitive science and
3480620	3487020	then by my former colleague Evan Thompson who is like if you want to
3487020	3490020	understand 4e cognitive science you have to look at Evan's work Evan is
3490020	3499220	brilliant and profound and it was it was a loss when he left University of
3499220	3505260	Toronto go to UBC so they coined this term of sense-making and the the basic
3505260	3514140	idea is this that even a paramecium right is doing it's detecting its
3514140	3519780	environment right and it's adapting and responding and so in its sensory motor
3519780	3524860	behavior it's it is treating it's not seeing it doesn't have consciousness or
3524860	3534120	everything like that but it's detecting this molecule as food food isn't part of
3534120	3537780	physics like if you look in a physics textbook you won't you won't find a
3537780	3541620	definition for food food is an affordance relationship between this
3541620	3547180	chemical and this the autopoiesis the self-making of the paramecium the
3547180	3550660	paramecium because it's constantly taking care of itself because it's a
3550660	3554340	living thing it's caring about this I don't mean full blow in emotion but
3554340	3558660	there's a kind of caring very small scale right there's a kind of caring of
3558660	3564540	and it's also that molecule is poison so it swims away from that one and swims
3564540	3569300	towards this one so it's doing sense-making it's making sense of its
3569300	3574740	right of its environment now if you lift that sense-making up into what we
3574740	3580220	could call kinds of knowing then the sense-making I would argue is meaning
3580220	3585860	making in this time right now where people are trying to make sense of so
3585860	3592700	much why do you do you feel that this is a skill that people could work to get
3592700	3597700	better at I would be I'd be really strong about that I would say it's a
3597700	3604020	necessity if you do not get better at waiting through all the bullshit and I
3604020	3607580	use that in a very technical sense maybe you can ask me about that but if we do
3607580	3610620	not get better and one of the other symptoms of the meeting crisis we
3610620	3613940	track this in the book is people feel like bullshit and bullshitting is
3613940	3618340	expanding both quantitatively there's more of it and it's in more domains and
3618340	3623660	it's people are getting more and more shameless about the bullshitting which
3623660	3630500	is really egregious if you don't do something about that toxicity right the
3630500	3638700	way that that is radically undermining your capacity to connect to reality and
3638700	3643540	exacerbating making you more and more prone to self-deceptive self-destructive
3643540	3650420	behavior if you don't do anything about that given the way right social media is
3650420	3654020	complexifying and with it the bullshitting is complexifying and
3654020	3659100	permeating your life and percolating into the depths of the psyche and ways
3659100	3662540	you're not aware of if you're watching if you're using lots of social media I
3662540	3667020	will predict that you are suffering more depression and anxiety I'm confident
3667020	3674100	about that if you don't do something to address and ameliorate that I strongly
3674100	3679460	predict it's going to get worse for you with time and not only with you as an
3679460	3683300	individual but with you and your group
3683340	3692700	would you explain echo chambers sure so remember we talked about you know the
3692700	3698660	way we we have to focus in and and and these are very adaptive now one of the
3698660	3704660	things you do and I do too is we do what's called the confirmation bias now
3704660	3708900	in a lot of environments this is adaptive so I want I want to understand
3708900	3712780	that I want you to understand that but what does it mean well what does it mean
3712780	3718980	is generally we don't look for information that challenges or
3718980	3724140	disconfirms our belief we look for information that supports it that's
3724140	3729500	confirmation bias again one more time right in a lot of environments messy
3729500	3734900	environments complex environments right that's adaptive that's why we do it but
3734900	3740980	it makes us vulnerable to environments that aren't ones we evolved to fit like
3740980	3747980	the internet where we can rapidly get access to hundreds and hundreds of
3747980	3752700	people confirming our belief in something and then when that goes to that
3752700	3756700	starvation for meaning then we don't want to give up any beliefs we can just
3756700	3761420	again and then we can we can just do this we I can reinforce your confirmation
3761420	3765620	bias you can reinforce mine my my collaborator and good friend Leo
3765620	3769580	Ferrero he calls this confirmation porn we can get into this kind of
3769580	3776420	pornography of just confirming and confirming and we get locked in and
3776420	3780780	then we more and more identify with it because you're telling me yeah yeah
3780780	3784700	that's the way the world is and so I'm more and more and then we just cycle in
3784700	3790660	this is a phenomenon that my friend and colleague Mark Lewis in his work on
3790660	3797020	addiction calls reciprocal narrowing and then I think that the and I said I
3797020	3801060	said this to Mark I think the platonic wisdom tradition talks about an opposite
3801060	3806740	thing we can cultivate which is reciprocal opening so echo chambers are
3806740	3810860	reciprocal narrowing and when look think what happens to the addict the addict
3810860	3815380	loses cognitive flexibility and so their options in the world go down so the
3815380	3820140	world gets more and more narrow and then they internalize that and then they get
3820140	3824820	more and more narrow and that until I can't be any other than I am the world
3824820	3829620	can't be any other than it is and that's addiction so this echo chambering is
3829620	3833580	very analogous to that reciprocal narrowing that's going on in addiction
3833580	3837780	and we we are addicted to a lot of stuff I mean the addiction crisis as I
3837780	3843140	mentioned is one of the issue we're more and more finding ourselves addicted to
3843140	3846980	more and more things and there's more and more people that are exploiting us
3846980	3853140	politically economically by getting us addicted and the internet has algorithms
3853140	3860180	that do that. I think that this is a really really important topic right now
3860180	3867580	because PTSD is a household term yes but post-traumatic growth very few people
3867580	3871780	have even heard of that I know the lack of awareness that things can be great on
3871780	3875660	the other side of difficult experiences that just seems like a responsible thing
3875660	3881620	to know yes talk about so this is a serious concern of ours as we put this
3881620	3886180	documentary out there is an invalidation or perception of an invalidation of an
3886180	3890980	experience people assuming that because we're talking about post-traumatic
3890980	3896060	growth PTSD doesn't exist or we're anti PTSD and so I would love to talk to you
3896060	3901300	about this or if you can explain a little bit about or just if I were to speak on
3901300	3909940	behalf of that person right now my echo chamber makes me feel heard you know I
3909940	3915220	feel like I have a community yes I'm infertile and I'm seeing how hard other
3915220	3920020	women have it yes yes that feels good but to what extent and when does that
3920020	3925780	become a negative experience right and so that's that's a really beautiful
3925780	3931180	question I thought that's well well framed and a problem well framed is you
3931180	3938980	know the the beginning of insight so I mean there's a lot of variables and and
3938980	3944980	the and this is not to derail what we're doing but the literature on you know
3944980	3948140	post-traumatic growth is going like the scientific literature is in this
3948140	3952860	liminal place because we're sort of through first wave and then there's been
3952860	3956620	a second critical wave and now people are coming out of that and there so we're
3956660	3964180	trying to get a more sophisticated answer to a very complex phenomenon but let's
3964180	3968700	go back to the so I want I want that as sort of the general frame in which we're
3968700	3972100	talking about this let's go back to the what's the difference between a support
3972100	3978460	group like AA and right an echo chamber because they do share important
3978460	3985540	similarities and so one of the things you given what we've said one of the things
3985660	3988740	you should look for at least a set of things is you should look for is your
3988740	3995700	group actually promoting cognitive flexibility is it promoting reciprocal
3995700	4000100	opening is it helping you to gain more flexibility are you having more aha
4000100	4004180	moments now the thing about these groups is they give you initial oh I didn't
4004180	4008180	realize that the leprechauns were behind it all and stuff like that right so
4008180	4013860	right and they give you sort of pseudo insight so you have to ask yourself this
4013980	4019220	question are the insights in the cognitive flexibility within the group
4019220	4024820	transferring to your life outside of the group let me give you a really good
4024820	4029300	analogy for this think about different kinds of video games or let's comply
4029300	4033860	one kind I'm not saying all video games are like this I'm not let's say one kind
4033860	4038100	of video game and something like Tai Chi Chuan and this was a transformative
4038100	4042580	thing for me not the video games of the Tai Chi Chuan okay so you know people
4043380	4047620	one of the reasons kids love video games is because video games are flow induction
4047620	4052260	machines they they're they're like jazz they are reliable for putting people
4052260	4062100	into the flow state right so within that world they're just but you get video
4062100	4068340	game addiction the WHO has designated an addiction when that doesn't transfer to
4068340	4074740	your life so the skills like all and the perspective of the states of
4074740	4077620	consciousness in mind their sense of identity and self because you're
4077620	4080420	manipulating those and video games like a religion
4082580	4086980	right is that is that percolating through the rest of your psyche is it
4086980	4089540	permeating through your life is it transferring
4091620	4095380	when I was doing Tai Chi and I started back in 91
4095380	4101940	before cell phones right the ancient times I was in grad school like I said I
4101940	4105860	was doing the Tai Chi for cultivating wisdom I was in grad school at the time
4107460	4110980	and it's funny because when you're in grad school you're always you always feel like
4110980	4114180	you're an imposter right I don't really belong here they're going to find out
4114180	4120660	eventually right the people came up to me my friends and I've been doing the
4120740	4125460	Tai Chi like religiously in both senses of the word I was doing it every day for
4125460	4129060	two or three hours a day and I was having all these amazing experiences you know
4129060	4133060	the days when you you're as hot as fire and the days where you're as cold as ice
4133060	4138500	and you're getting into the flow state and it's amazing but I was just I was just in that world
4138500	4145460	they came up to me and they said what's up with you what do you mean they said you're different
4145460	4150420	you're way more flexible in your thinking you're way more empathetic and picking up on other
4150420	4159220	people you're way more balanced in your argumentation and I realized oh the Tai Chi was moving beyond
4159220	4164260	the martial art arena and it was percolating through my psyche it's permeating through my
4164260	4167940	lives it was transforming and that's because I wasn't just doing the Tai Chi Chuan I was doing
4167940	4173220	these ecologies and I was learning the philosophy of Taoism and so it was like and that's what
4173220	4180020	religions do they give you these and it does that that's my criteria if you're in your support
4180100	4187300	group and whatever's happening here you feel that it's percolating through your psyche in a way
4187300	4195060	that's permeating through your life and opening up your life and you've got a support group if you
4195060	4201620	feel it's taking you down and you're getting locked in and you can only find that in the group
4202420	4207460	then you're moving towards an addiction you're moving towards kind of spirituality
4207540	4213700	you're moving towards a cult now those are on a continuum I present them as opposites for contrast
4213700	4217780	but we they're on a continuum and there's going to be stuff in the gray zone it's going to be I'm
4217780	4221780	not sure when I get that and that's going to take discernment and discussion and reflection
4221780	4229620	but that's how I would say is it open are you reciprocally opening comprehensively
4229620	4233780	about across more and more in your life are your existing relationships getting better
4233780	4238340	are you feeling more in touch with reality are you able to cultivate new friendships are you
4238340	4244340	able to cultivate new virtues the answer is yes chances are you have a support group if the answer
4244340	4249060	to those increasingly if those is increasingly no chances are you're locking you're locking into
4249060	4260660	an echo chamber thank you okay last question for me um is are there any other areas of research
4260660	4268500	that if you had another you that can explore whatever and you just don't have time for right
4268500	4274340	now is there any like like epigenetics or something that feel like could be a really cool thread to go
4274340	4284100	down with your work oh boy um I I joke with my colleagues um like my dear friend Dan Chappie
4284100	4287380	we've published a bunch of stuff together we're always working together I don't know if you know
4287380	4292500	but there's a there's a science fiction classic show called Dr. Who and he has the TARDIS which is
4292500	4296420	you know trans dimensional and all this I want a TARDIS where I can go in there and be outside
4296420	4301220	time and space and do a bunch of stuff and then come back out there I have to tell you Jessica
4301220	4306740	there's so many books that I'm like I'm currently reading about 30 books at a time it's a skill I've
4306740	4311220	been cultivating for like three decades I don't recommend it for anybody as a novice but even
4311220	4317060	that I feel like just I look at all the books I'm not reading and I go I need to know this because
4317060	4323940	you know I'm more ignorant than than than than I have knowledge I would like to know a lot more
4323940	4334580	about neuroscience I would like to know a lot more about like I I've studied some I've studied both
4334580	4338980	from the outside as an academic and from the inside as a practitioner Taoism and Buddhism
4338980	4343940	Christianity Neil Platonism Stoicism but there's a whole bunch like I don't know very much about
4343940	4351140	Islam not enough about Judaism not enough about lots of aspects of Hinduism Vedanta the indigenous
4351140	4356420	stuff I know a bit about shamanism but to equate that to indigenous culture is like terrifically
4356420	4363300	racist and ethnocentric so I admit that I'm mostly ignorant I want to know I just yeah like so I
4363300	4370580	the hard neuroscience up to you know you know the cultural anthropology those are the two ends of
4370580	4376820	my where I feel that I need to know more that's where I mean I need to fill in a lot in between
4376820	4382420	that sounded arrogant pretentious but where I feel the gap most prominently is on those ends
4383460	4385940	awesome thank you thank you so much
