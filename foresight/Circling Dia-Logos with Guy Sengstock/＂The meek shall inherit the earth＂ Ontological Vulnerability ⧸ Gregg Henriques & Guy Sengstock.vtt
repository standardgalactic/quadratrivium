WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
It's good to see you.

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
Can you hear me okay?

00:04.000 --> 00:05.000
Yep.

00:05.000 --> 00:07.000
There was a little bit of interference there, but right now it's good.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
So it's good to see you guy.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
It's been too long to connect.

00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
And I want to officially congratulate you on your new edition.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.000
Thank you.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.000
Oh, that's gotta be a.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.000
Yeah.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.000
Yeah.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
Yeah.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.000
Yeah.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
Yeah.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.000
Yeah.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.000
That's right.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.000
Yes.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.000
All right.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.000
Good to see you.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.000
Can you hear me? Okay.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.000
Yep.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.000
Thank you.

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
That's gotta be a pretty exciting thing to bring,

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
bring another life into the world.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.000
I know.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.000
Three times.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
Yeah.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.000
Beautiful.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
Beautiful.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
Right.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
Yeah.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
Three times totally.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
Yeah.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
In fact, in fact, I, I'm not,

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
I'm not in the place I'm normally at because.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
My mother came to visit for the first time.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
So she's meeting T.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
And it's so.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
So, so guy, guy got kicked out.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
So he's, he's asking Mark.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
Well, that's what happens when new ones come along, you know,

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
the old ones get shuffled out.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Absolutely.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Right.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
We see the priority here.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Amen.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Yeah.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
So one of the things I wanted to talk with you about.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Right.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
And I think a lot of this has to do with.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
With the way that I,

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
I see you really linking a lot of things together.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Right.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
And, and, and I want to, I want to set some,

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
I want to set some frames up here and then we can just see,

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
see how it leads all together. But, you know,

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
it's precisely,

01:29.000 --> 01:34.000
precisely your work and the way you situate.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
That sense of the primate, right.

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
That goes then into justification. Right.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
And that this,

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
my understanding is this primate level is the level of like attachment.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
Right.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Right.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
It's the level of attunement, attachment, all,

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
and there's of course stuff with Bowlby and couples therapy.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
I mean, there's the evidence for that is just Astramont.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
You know, it's so predictive how that goes.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Right.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
It's very powerful force.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
It's surprising anyone ever missed that.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
We somehow missed that.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Right.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
I'm glad we'll be picking up and others. Yeah.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Yeah.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
Absolutely.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
And how that goes into justification. Right.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
And in the social arena,

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
where you become in your,

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
come the person, you know,

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
some sense you become initiated in a,

02:27.000 --> 02:32.000
as a person in terms of socially justifying your own existence in

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
front of others. Right.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
Exactly.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
And also the way,

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
there's another way that you talk about it,

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
just to set this frame too, which I really,

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
I appreciate is that of course,

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
then of course it's in that justification where things get

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
really fucked up. Right.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
And we end up totally split.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
So in order to justify my existence,

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
I can't talk about this part of my existence and then I feel guilty.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
Then we have the splits.

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
Then we see the psychologist and the psychologist is all about

03:05.000 --> 03:10.000
helping unite these lower systems and these orders and sharing

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
the story. Right.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
And so I think that's one of the things that I think is really

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
important.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
And I think that's one of the things that I think is really important

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
is that you can open around these,

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
these defensiveness,

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
this defensiveness and adaptations. Right.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Absolutely.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
Yeah.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
And all of that coming together and how,

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
and in what way.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
That in some sense is.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
Is connected ontologically to things. Right.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
Right.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
Absolutely.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
And, and so as we were talking about,

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
I'm just going to summarize what we talked about before we hit record.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Right.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
One of the things for a while that I've been really thinking a lot

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
about is this notion of.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
School lay.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
The Greek sense of school lay,

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
which,

03:50.000 --> 03:55.000
which usually translates into English is leisure.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
And of course,

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
leisure and idleness leisure is, is, is the core.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
It's kind of, it's, it's so core to economics.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Right.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
And metaphorically to everything that,

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
that if everything's going well, people work and then they have

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
leisure. Right.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
They work too much and they don't have leisure. That's bad. Right.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Yep.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
And however, it's very different.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
That sense of leisure is not,

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
doesn't get at the deeper sense of the way that they talked about

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
school lay.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
Philosophically and religious.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
Right.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Yeah.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
The Greeks.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
The Greeks saw school lay.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
He uses this example.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
For example,

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
Aristotle said that all fear,

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
fear,

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
in geometry happens in school lay.

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
And then in, in the apology, I think it was.

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
Socrates said that I actually think you guys shouldn't kill me.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
I think, I think,

04:56.000 --> 05:01.000
I think Athens should pay me to be in school lay and.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
And have, and speak philosophy.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
Those conversations, right?

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
Right. Right.

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
And so you get this sense with school lay that like for the Greeks,

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
whereas in leisure, there's a sense in which there's time.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
And then you fill time.

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
And then if, if you work, if you work hard enough and right enough,

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
and the economy works well,

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
then you can work for a certain amount of time.

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
And then at the end you have free time or leisure.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
And you notice that conception of time is the same throughout.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
It's just a matter of if it's filled with stuff or not filled with stuff.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Yes.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
But with something like, with something like theory or,

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
or philosophy or geometry, right?

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
At these higher levels of essentially contemplating being.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
There's a very, very different sense of time, right?

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
It's really precisely the pinnacle where, where,

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
where means and ends come together as one thing.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
Love it. Right.

05:57.000 --> 06:03.000
And so bringing this back into me having a kid, right?

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
And, and everything that we're talking about was attachment, right?

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
Right.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
Totally.

06:09.000 --> 06:14.000
Is for the Greeks.

06:14.000 --> 06:20.000
Skolle, the root of Skolle means holding to hold.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
Right.

06:22.000 --> 06:27.000
And that really only makes sense in relationship to time.

06:27.000 --> 06:32.000
So Skolle in the Greek sense was that time was something for

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
which was of our concern.

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
It was an essential concern in the sense that there was a way that

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
if there's a way to hold time,

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
such that time in turn turns back and holds us.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
Love that.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
Right.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
The Skolle was a way of being in time and holding time,

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
but then of revealing time, right?

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
In a way that they're mutually disclosive, right?

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
And so that was the essence of time itself.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
So there's this really sense where meaning in time, right?

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
Being in time would, would receive their pinnacle.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
And it wasn't like you were in Skolle and then not in Skolle.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
No, it was more, it was more,

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
this was connected with the revelation of what time was, right?

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
Which was the direct concern for us.

07:16.000 --> 07:21.000
And so if you look at it now though, without that sense of time,

07:21.000 --> 07:26.000
where time now is more this kind of anatomical force in which it,

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
of course we're subject to it and it concerns us,

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
but there's no sense in which time.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
It all responds to us, right?

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
It's like we're subject to it.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
And therefore I think what,

07:38.000 --> 07:42.000
what that's done on some level is we no longer see

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
meaning in time as unified, right?

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
Or as a couple.

07:47.000 --> 07:51.000
So therefore time is just this force, right?

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
That can't really hold meaning.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
It can just give lawful,

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
you can get a lot,

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
lawful like sustaining an entropy to circumstance.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
Therefore,

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
therefore we need to find meaning in the,

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
the sensations of our circumstances that you will, right?

08:09.000 --> 08:13.000
Thus the drama, but there's nothing about time that it all

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
responds to us, right?

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
And that sense that the Greeks had about it.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
And so that in that,

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
and just this idea that in Schole,

08:22.000 --> 08:27.000
that it's, it's this relationship to the ontology of time that,

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
that, that, that, that,

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
that the way I am comport is already a comporting or a holding

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
of time and that time is that which is holding me.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
Right.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
And now I think about that.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
Now I have a baby, right?

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
No, I'm thinking about all this.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
And now I have a baby, right?

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
And yeah.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
And somebody asked me how Teague was.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
And before I responded,

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
I noticed that I had this picture of Teague, right?

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
And that,

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
that I hadn't noticed that there is no Teague to simply Teague

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
being held, right?

09:01.000 --> 09:06.000
At every picture, like either literally by our hands or held by

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
our attention or being held by the thing we set up for the crib.

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
In fact, if there's like a second where we don't have our eye on him,

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
it's like a big deal, right?

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
Hey, hey.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
And so, right?

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
And so there's no such thing as Teague.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
There's Teague continuous with being held.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
Right.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
And then if we think about that, right?

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
So there's something real.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
I'm like, okay, what is this,

09:29.000 --> 09:34.000
this connection between time, meaning ontology,

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
our vulnerability as human beings,

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
the fact that we primordially start like this,

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
like a deep vulnerability and an openness to the very holding,

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
right?

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Which then that holding in turn,

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
hopefully they internalize and as they internalize it,

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
as he grows up, we will then let go and he will take on the whole

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
holding.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
And so in some sense,

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
I'm wondering about this idea of holding.

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
What does that reveal about the ontologically the case with us and

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
human beings, right?

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
Totally.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
Totally.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
All right.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
So those are all the thought islands.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
Let's see if we can,

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
we see if we can peer underneath the surface,

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
pull some sort of synergy out of that.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
Yeah.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
Yeah.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
That's a beautiful set of observations.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
Let me just say that. Okay.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
I love,

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
I didn't know about the Greek word skole.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Can you say that?

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Okay.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
So we know about that word.

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
So let me give you just some thoughts to start to ground us in,

10:31.000 --> 10:35.000
in relation to the holding environment that we can then cultivate.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
Yeah.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
Okay.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
Yeah.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
So the first thing, a couple of things that come to mind,

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
one is our vertical integration.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
Okay.

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
Vertical integration of us as organisms first.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Okay.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
Yeah.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
Into animals,

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
which then is the base of our feeling system.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
And we can feel that, you know,

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
in our gut and our loins and in our gut.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
Okay.

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
And that's the way the position of the body and whether we got pain

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
or emptiness in our stomach or horny and longs in the loins.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
It's an appetite of desires.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
It's a very platonic play-toe version.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
Yeah.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
And that's our animal.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
You know,

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
our organism into animal level from a to K view.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
So you're a bio physiological entity.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
And then the first thing is, Hey,

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
you got to take care of survival.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Shit.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
You know, right?

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
Yeah.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
And then we're social primates.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
Okay.

11:30.000 --> 11:35.000
So then we move into the, what I metaphorically refer to the heart.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
Okay.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
And the heart's the relationship attachment system.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
Okay.

11:40.000 --> 11:45.000
And there's nothing more central to an infant than this.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
I mean the whole,

11:46.000 --> 11:52.000
because the entire safety food and relational matrix are all

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
intimately intertwined in virtually every infant's experience.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Yeah.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Yeah.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
And we see that in the holding that,

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
whether they're being prepared and connected,

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
they're so dependent.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
And for the first six months,

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
they are completely dependent upon the environment in which they're

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
held.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
Yeah. Right. Yeah.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
I know they're, they're, they're absorbing stuff.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
They have enormous plasticity.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
They're upgrading the various models,

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
but they're just checking shit out basically.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
Yeah.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
They have a little bit of hand movement and a lot of,

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
they put shit in their mouth.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
Yes.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
And they track everything really fast with the head.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Yeah.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
And they have a visual auditory learning system,

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
but the body is doing, you know, it's barely roll over.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
Right. Right. Yes.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
Right.

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
So they're, so the system then in what they're doing from it,

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
that we can, we spoke about John Bulby. Okay.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
So what he noticed is we,

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
the early systems of psychiatry psychology, well,

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
the key really is food.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
So, you know, we had orphanage.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
We just fed them as long as they stayed alive and the temperature

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
was thing and they didn't have any threat and they were getting

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
out of bed.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
They should be all right.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
And then all of these kids and orphanages that weren't being,

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
we're all broken in some ways, you know,

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
they were underdeveloped.

13:04.000 --> 13:09.000
They felt the whole socio-emotional systems was out of touch.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
They got these weird attachment structures that was a fundamental

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
set of insecurity.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
Okay.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
That the,

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
that the environment would drop out of them at a particular level.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
Yeah.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
They weren't known and valued and they wouldn't be protected.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
Yeah.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
And then they had to, they were, kids would respond in certain ways.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
You'd either get very hyper dependent. Oh my God.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
Just try sending out alarms all the time, hyper neurotic,

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
sending out certain alarms to be so that they try to get what little

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
attention they could.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Yeah.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
Or they would go avoidant, which is hyper independent.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
They try to crush this need of the heart and then be,

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
I don't need anybody. I'll just try to suppress it.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
Or they would get really, especially if they were abused,

13:47.000 --> 13:51.000
then they get really erratic and disorganized attachments.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
Okay.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
Yeah.

13:53.000 --> 13:57.000
And really this is what later attachment is about the circle.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
Of security that you're actually wanting to see build,

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
which is a fundamental participatory dance between the caregiver.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
And the infant.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
Where you're tracking eye movements and building a shared attention,

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
intention, space.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
Yeah.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
So that you can then create the ground,

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
the socio-emotional ground that you will be cared for.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
And if you have particular needs, you can signal them and I'll be able

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
to empathize with you and I'll meet them.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
Okay.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
Yeah.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
Yeah.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
This creates the ground of the secure base.

14:27.000 --> 14:31.000
From which the infant can go at six months into the next couple of

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
years and start to move away from the base.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
Okay.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
Yeah.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
And then return to the holding environment.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
If it falls, if the kid falls and scrapes his knee,

14:41.000 --> 14:45.000
runs back to mom and dad and gets immediately returned to the holding

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
environment.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
Yeah.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
Yeah.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
Yeah.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
Yeah.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
Because the entire primate animal organism system is like check.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
Okay.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
Am I held safe?

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
Or am I in the dark woods somewhere by myself?

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
The ultimate panic, right?

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
Which is.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
Right.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
Complete.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
Yeah.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
Yeah.

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
You're about to get eaten by a dark man and a tiger in the woods.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
Absolutely.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
So that's an unbelievable, that darkness is unbelievably,

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
you know, concerning the poor panic abandonment and the felt sense of

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
worthlessness and this felt sense of insecurity, you know,

15:16.000 --> 15:20.000
and are you, and then you get polyvagal defensiveness throughout the

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
system when you're getting this structure.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
Yeah.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
Okay.

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
So you're being, you're either being held in the matrix of care or

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
not.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
Yeah.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
And those are the two basic secure insecure.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
And of course there's a lot in between.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
Yeah.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
Basically the matrix says there's actually these two equilibrium

15:36.000 --> 15:40.000
states at a bimodal kind of distribution of being held.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
And then you track the interpersonal world.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
And indeed we know kids can be feel pretty safe with mom and not

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
with dad or vice versa, depending on the dance, the relation.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
It's called the circle of security and the more advanced

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
simulations that then afford.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
Right.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
When it's there, it's a particular holding environment.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
So, so the, the, when you have that,

16:01.000 --> 16:05.000
you're going to create coherent integration in the environment,

16:05.000 --> 16:09.000
into the body, into the animal, into the social primate.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
Okay.

16:10.000 --> 16:14.000
And that's really the first couple of years is trying to create that

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
fundamental secure base.

16:16.000 --> 16:21.000
So the system can then trust basic trust to use, you know,

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
the world and that you're going to get your needs met or basic

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
mistrust.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
This is the Ericksonian formulation.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
Okay.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
A basic trust is mistrust.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
Yeah.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
That says, Hey,

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
yes, I will get my needs met because the environment will hold me in

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
a particular way.

16:35.000 --> 16:40.000
And the environment holds me because it sees me as valuable.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
Yes.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
Exactly.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
That connection between value and holding, right?

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
And what that means seems to be.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
Super.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Deeply, deeply central. Yeah.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
And I make a very important point about my own development in this

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
theoretical structure called the influence matrix,

16:55.000 --> 16:59.000
which first emphasized it from an evolutionary instrumental way,

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
which is totally valid, but it's incomplete originally.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
And that is what I call that the social influence line.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
Okay.

17:06.000 --> 17:10.000
And social and it was to bind in sort of instrumental terms,

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
to what extent can you influence others in accordance with your

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
interests?

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
Okay.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
If I cry, will you come help me?

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
Or will you ignore me?

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
So it's an instrumental framing,

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
which at a pragmatic level of survival is key.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
However,

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
what I saw in the clinic room is that a lot of people could have

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
influence, but feel very empty inside.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
Okay.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
And they would go around and they wouldn't,

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
or they would feel that they were not valued.

17:35.000 --> 17:39.000
And I realized that actually the ultimate sort of core,

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
even from an evolutionary perspective,

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
the core equilibrium safe space is to be valued,

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
not just to be able to manipulate others instrumentally.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
Cause if the contingency of manipulation disappears,

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
then the,

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
then there's no intrinsic motive for mom and dad to love you.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
Then they're out of it.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
Okay.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
Yeah.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
But if they're totally,

17:57.000 --> 18:01.000
if their motivational system is attached to you by its own valuing

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
structure,

18:02.000 --> 18:06.000
then that at a particular level, that's really key.

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
The other thing that's going to get back into why this is so

18:09.000 --> 18:13.000
important is because modern science basically thinks and economics

18:13.000 --> 18:17.000
thinks in terms of instrumental means and relationship and trying

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
to maximize productive control.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
Okay.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
They then, in fact,

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
the entire social capital laborers basically,

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
influence and investment and return on investment in instrumentality,

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
modes of production and control.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
Okay.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
Yeah.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
So the whole thing basically is like,

18:32.000 --> 18:36.000
how do we efficiently maximize our influence and power over the

18:36.000 --> 18:40.000
things for the least amount of money in relationship to particular

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
outcomes.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
So now you create the doing instrumental mindset.

18:44.000 --> 18:48.000
That then fundamentally merges as the dominant mode.

18:48.000 --> 18:53.000
And this now brings in Eric from the dominant mode of doing that then

18:53.000 --> 18:57.000
becomes so salient for the way in which we all think that's a

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
quantifiable and, you know,

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
many scientists see the behavioral and evolutionary sciences.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Oh, we're all just selfish anyway.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
And this is what we really care about and blah, blah, blah.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
Yeah.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
And you know, what you can do is you, you know,

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
there is really any God, there's no real purpose,

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
but you can at least get the most toys that you have.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
And get as much accomplishment.

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
And then that's, that's the doing of what, you know,

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
you get rich and you get status and you get leisure time.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
And that's what you're trying to get.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
Yeah.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
You know, do, do, do.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
Yes.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
Okay.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
Right.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
So we'll love you, but at least we can hack it.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
Yeah.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
At least we can hack it.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
At least I can get the most.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
Yeah.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
At least we can hack it.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
At least I can get the most toys.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
But like, at least we can hack that.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
That's right.

19:38.000 --> 19:41.000
I got a big fucking Vita that's going to substitute, you know,

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
for true love,

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
but at least I got a big fucking Vita or have a nice Lamborghini

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
or something or not.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
And then you're on the low shit.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
And you can't do, and then you fail and all of that.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
Yeah.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
Yeah.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
And then it's like, well, okay, well, what am I doing here?

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Well, I'm just trying to, I'm trying to,

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
everything's a means to an end relation.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
I mean, look at money.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
I mean, to the extent that then money becomes the symbol.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
It's the ultimate instrumental symbol.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
Yeah. For some people, they get it so confused.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
I was like, I want to make more money.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
You know, it's like,

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
as if that is some sort of quantifying in it.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
That's empty calories at the core.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
Yeah.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
Yeah.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
Yeah.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
Yeah.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
And I think that we're,

20:17.000 --> 20:22.000
we have driven the doing mode to try to control energy and time

20:22.000 --> 20:27.000
in an instrumental kind of way to enormous excess.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
Okay.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
Yeah.

20:29.000 --> 20:33.000
And then that's not good calories for feeling,

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
spending time in an attached relational environment,

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
in nature,

20:37.000 --> 20:41.000
feeling the oneness of the self-world modeling structure,

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
feeling held by that,

20:42.000 --> 20:46.000
feeling fundamentally present and fulfilled in relationship to it,

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
feeling the integration between the body,

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
into the animal, into the heart,

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
into the justification, into the spirit,

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
mattering value purpose.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
That's what I call vertical integration.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
Okay.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
So if you get vertical integration,

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
I would say then for me,

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
the label is wisdom energy.

21:03.000 --> 21:06.000
And what you feel is just a massive presence,

21:06.000 --> 21:10.000
a fundamental fit between the self-world environment

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
and a massive presencing of that.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
Yeah.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
And then that is a eudaimonic ultimate endpoint.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
You are then in,

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
in sync,

21:19.000 --> 21:23.000
incoherent integrative sync with the system.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
Yeah.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
And then finally to bring it back to kind of the leisure,

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
I feel like I got lucky with Socrates.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
I'm a public intellectual.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
I get paid.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
And I tell people at the level of leisure,

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
it's like,

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
people are like, well, how often, how much do you work?

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
I was like, well,

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
I work either five or 75 hours a week,

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
depending on how you calculate it.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
Okay.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
Yeah.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
Yes.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
Because, you know,

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
I have five hours of shit I need to do that is the kind of labor.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
And, you know,

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
here's a paperwork thing, sign this prep.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
This is like,

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
while I'm doing it,

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
the only thing I'm doing is for,

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
for instrumental purpose to get something done.

21:54.000 --> 21:58.000
But I'm super lucky that I'm now at a place as full professor,

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
blah, blah, blah.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
That's like a huge amount of work like this.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
Is this work?

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
You know, are we are, am I, I don't, I love this.

22:04.000 --> 22:07.000
I feel that enormously just present.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
I feel connected to you.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
I feel our souls connected in a particular way.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
And then we engage in D a logos.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
And then that's a,

22:14.000 --> 22:19.000
then my experience of being in the world is just enriched by

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
these things.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
So yeah.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
No, it's like, you know,

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
it's productive and in growth promoting,

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
but it doesn't feel like I've had to,

22:26.000 --> 22:29.000
I'm trying to control something to get to some place.

22:29.000 --> 22:33.000
I'm in the place of being itself.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
Yeah.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
And that's,

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
and there's somehow in some sense implicitly there.

22:38.000 --> 22:42.000
And it's a couple of things that kind of link all of that together

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
all the way down to that.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
Like,

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
you know,

22:47.000 --> 22:50.000
I started with the first six months because the second six months,

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
right.

22:51.000 --> 22:58.000
All the way is like mature professor. Right.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
One is it sounds like your relationship with time is very,

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
very different, right.

23:01.000 --> 23:06.000
In some sense that there is a way that you relate to time that seems

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
like these things,

23:07.000 --> 23:11.000
these meetings or something like the pinnacle or express this

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
fundamental relationship where you're.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.800
There is a sense in which it holds you and inspires you.

23:15.800 --> 23:18.080
There's time disappears.

23:18.080 --> 23:21.120
There's the flow state, Deologos, all of that.

23:21.120 --> 23:22.400
Totally.

23:22.400 --> 23:24.280
Now, it's interesting too that

23:27.880 --> 23:30.880
this sense about when you talked about

23:32.200 --> 23:33.880
after the first six months and then they start,

23:33.880 --> 23:35.760
the child starts to venture away from the holding

23:35.760 --> 23:37.080
and then they come back, right?

23:37.080 --> 23:39.520
It's such a cool image of that,

23:39.520 --> 23:41.600
because you can see that too, because they do.

23:41.600 --> 23:43.240
They venture out, they're like,

23:43.240 --> 23:44.640
they'll check back and then they'll go,

23:44.640 --> 23:46.400
oh, they're gonna see what they gotta do.

23:46.400 --> 23:47.760
And then they'll check back really quick,

23:47.760 --> 23:48.920
are you still there, right?

23:48.920 --> 23:52.000
Like, you're still there, I'll go out and then you look back,

23:52.000 --> 23:52.840
right?

23:52.840 --> 23:56.560
They're test, they intrinsically are testing something.

23:56.560 --> 23:57.400
That's right.

23:57.400 --> 23:59.960
And, and God, and there's so many different ways

23:59.960 --> 24:01.720
that could get fucked up, right?

24:01.720 --> 24:03.960
Like, cause I was thinking about that when,

24:03.960 --> 24:06.320
if the, what happens when the child comes back

24:06.320 --> 24:08.320
and then the mother's destroyed and angry

24:08.320 --> 24:11.000
because the child left her, right?

24:11.000 --> 24:14.440
Like, and then, and so there's all kinds of ways

24:14.440 --> 24:18.680
that that dynamic relation can get all whacked out, right?

24:18.680 --> 24:21.920
And then usually it stresses itself in all these,

24:21.920 --> 24:23.960
you know, in broken marriages and-

24:23.960 --> 24:26.000
Well, we're right, and then we test it all the time

24:26.000 --> 24:26.840
for good reason.

24:26.840 --> 24:29.560
You're like, hey, I'm gonna, I'll drop a cry over here

24:29.560 --> 24:30.560
or I won't do other things.

24:30.560 --> 24:32.520
And it was not with conscious justification,

24:32.520 --> 24:35.360
but the design of the system is to know where it is.

24:35.360 --> 24:38.200
So, and we do this with our spouses, you test them.

24:38.840 --> 24:39.680
Yeah.

24:39.680 --> 24:41.800
You drop little, I mean, not like very rarely,

24:41.800 --> 24:43.720
I'm gonna adjust my, some people that,

24:43.720 --> 24:45.400
but you do it intuitively

24:45.400 --> 24:48.040
because you want to see where the value and attention is.

24:48.040 --> 24:48.880
Okay?

24:48.880 --> 24:51.920
Like, I mean, my kids, I mean, they've got five and three

24:51.920 --> 24:53.520
and you know, you cut two pieces of cake,

24:53.520 --> 24:55.640
hey, his cake's bigger than mine.

24:55.640 --> 24:58.200
And I was like, and I was like, okay,

24:58.200 --> 24:59.720
but you know, they're gonna check that

24:59.720 --> 25:02.040
and they're gonna be like, hey, you cut it

25:02.040 --> 25:04.200
and that reflects something in your heart, doesn't it?

25:04.200 --> 25:05.920
You love him more than you love me.

25:05.920 --> 25:07.600
Or you better draw attention to that.

25:07.640 --> 25:09.160
You know, there's a little, you know,

25:09.160 --> 25:10.840
that's a chronic state of,

25:10.840 --> 25:12.400
is this environment really holding

25:12.400 --> 25:14.480
and then I'll test it and see what happens.

25:14.480 --> 25:15.320
You know, really.

25:15.320 --> 25:17.040
Right, totally.

25:17.040 --> 25:17.880
Like I,

25:20.240 --> 25:22.680
well, the other thing about that that I didn't,

25:22.680 --> 25:26.040
I think I saw as you're talking about this differently

25:26.040 --> 25:27.520
than I saw it before,

25:27.520 --> 25:31.440
which is this back and forth, right, relation,

25:32.560 --> 25:36.640
that it's really, it's, it, how dynamic it is.

25:36.640 --> 25:39.440
It's like, I know we talk about it in terms of like,

25:39.440 --> 25:43.680
okay, is that, is the child starts to objectify, right?

25:43.680 --> 25:45.320
Will that object hold me, right?

25:45.320 --> 25:46.360
Is that all?

25:46.360 --> 25:48.120
But really when we look at it this set,

25:48.120 --> 25:51.720
they're not actually checking to a thing,

25:51.720 --> 25:54.600
but that the stability is precisely a way

25:54.600 --> 25:57.440
of a modal of relations happening, right?

25:57.440 --> 25:59.880
So it's not like there's something stable

25:59.880 --> 26:01.120
in a thing-like way.

26:01.120 --> 26:04.200
It's a dynamic, a nexus of relations that are going on.

26:04.200 --> 26:05.040
Totally.

26:05.040 --> 26:08.480
Which they start to feel a certain kind of safety with.

26:08.480 --> 26:11.920
And of course, the world is a chaotic network of relations,

26:11.920 --> 26:14.080
right, that they're trying to tolerate

26:14.080 --> 26:16.120
and then go back and forth.

26:16.120 --> 26:16.960
Right.

26:16.960 --> 26:18.400
And that, and that that's actually,

26:18.400 --> 26:20.160
and that it's also,

26:20.160 --> 26:23.960
it seems to me this relationship in some sense,

26:23.960 --> 26:26.560
that seems that back and forth implies

26:26.560 --> 26:29.720
a certain temporality, right?

26:29.720 --> 26:30.560
Nope.

26:30.560 --> 26:31.400
In some way.

26:31.400 --> 26:32.240
Sure.

26:32.240 --> 26:33.240
All right.

26:33.240 --> 26:34.520
Is my past.

26:34.520 --> 26:36.080
If I turn around and I look back,

26:36.080 --> 26:37.400
will it still be there?

26:37.400 --> 26:38.240
Right?

26:39.520 --> 26:41.120
This future, right?

26:41.120 --> 26:42.680
There's something drawing me in

26:42.680 --> 26:43.840
that I don't know about yet.

26:43.840 --> 26:44.960
Therefore it's chaotic,

26:44.960 --> 26:46.800
but then I'll turn around this past

26:46.800 --> 26:49.000
and this back and forth movement seems,

26:50.040 --> 26:53.400
I would imagine that's probably one of the,

26:53.400 --> 26:56.280
there's something there about temporality.

26:56.280 --> 26:57.120
Right.

26:57.120 --> 26:57.960
Well, the system starts to be able

26:57.960 --> 26:59.600
to extend itself over time.

26:59.600 --> 27:01.120
That's one of the first things, okay?

27:01.120 --> 27:03.160
So then the way in which you,

27:03.160 --> 27:05.600
I mean, at first it's pretty immediate.

27:05.600 --> 27:07.880
And then the capacity to then,

27:07.880 --> 27:10.120
and indeed it is the argument that John and I

27:10.120 --> 27:12.280
and Chris were making in the elusive eye was,

27:12.280 --> 27:15.120
it is this capacity to begin to extend the self over time

27:15.120 --> 27:17.880
through multiplicity of possible simulations

27:17.880 --> 27:20.080
where the environment then changes as you,

27:20.080 --> 27:22.960
but then it is the extension of self in that time

27:22.960 --> 27:26.320
that really starts to give this self agent environment

27:26.320 --> 27:30.000
relation and then the self other relational matrix

27:30.000 --> 27:32.440
that then creates the model of the self.

27:32.520 --> 27:34.600
Okay, so that means that we start to carry

27:34.600 --> 27:35.880
and then we extend.

27:35.880 --> 27:39.640
So that issue of who am I across time,

27:39.640 --> 27:42.800
basically becomes the modeling structures

27:42.800 --> 27:45.640
that afford you the opportunity to get a grip,

27:45.640 --> 27:46.720
on the world.

27:46.720 --> 27:50.880
So how you build that is through the attachments

27:50.880 --> 27:53.400
of first mom and dad need to be present

27:53.400 --> 27:55.720
or there needs to be a security system present

27:55.720 --> 27:57.160
at first six months.

27:57.160 --> 27:59.440
Then all of a sudden that it begins to extend

27:59.440 --> 28:01.880
into an autonomy versus shame and doubt.

28:01.880 --> 28:04.680
That's the next lace title, which is autonomy is like,

28:04.680 --> 28:06.920
hey, I can now actually start to exhibit.

28:06.920 --> 28:09.000
I have the motor work and cognitive capacity

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
start to exhibit control over the world

28:11.000 --> 28:13.600
and distance myself, okay?

28:13.600 --> 28:15.760
But as soon as I get distance in any way out here

28:15.760 --> 28:18.680
in the darkness and I'm still just learning shit,

28:18.680 --> 28:20.400
it all of a sudden becomes a dark, scary world.

28:20.400 --> 28:23.280
Now I have to quickly touch, is mom gonna be there?

28:23.280 --> 28:26.880
You know, if I move away, you know, when I look back.

28:26.880 --> 28:30.120
And so then you have to expand the temporality

28:30.120 --> 28:32.640
of the field of consideration

28:32.640 --> 28:36.320
because now the opportunity across time is increasing

28:36.320 --> 28:38.320
and you have to start to really protect

28:38.320 --> 28:40.120
what's going on in relationship to that.

28:40.120 --> 28:41.160
Right.

28:41.160 --> 28:44.360
I mean, so interesting just to kind of grok this sense of

28:45.720 --> 28:48.960
if I turn around and if I look up and it gets scary

28:48.960 --> 28:50.880
and I turn around, are they still there?

28:50.880 --> 28:55.880
That there is so linked to value, right?

28:56.400 --> 28:59.440
Am I valued enough such that people stay around, right?

28:59.440 --> 29:02.720
It's so interesting to think about it like that, right?

29:02.720 --> 29:05.680
Being valued is so primary.

29:05.680 --> 29:06.520
Totally.

29:06.520 --> 29:07.600
That's it.

29:07.600 --> 29:10.080
The fund, that is the core of the heart soul

29:10.080 --> 29:12.280
is to be known and valued by important others,

29:12.280 --> 29:13.720
at least according to the unified theory.

29:13.720 --> 29:16.480
It's the fundamental calories, okay?

29:16.480 --> 29:18.080
Of that part of your psyche.

29:18.080 --> 29:20.760
And it's absolutely as crucial as good calories

29:20.760 --> 29:23.400
for the body, you know, it's a fundamental

29:23.400 --> 29:25.480
in some ways even, you know, at the level.

29:25.480 --> 29:27.400
So am I known and valued?

29:27.400 --> 29:28.840
It's not just can I manipulate them

29:28.840 --> 29:33.840
but fundamentally they care about me, you know,

29:33.840 --> 29:35.720
and my essence, okay?

29:35.720 --> 29:38.320
And in non-contingent ways, they care about me.

29:38.320 --> 29:39.600
Yeah, yeah.

29:39.600 --> 29:41.200
That's what people really track

29:41.200 --> 29:43.080
and they desperately need.

29:43.080 --> 29:45.320
And unfortunately, because of our humanness though,

29:45.320 --> 29:47.240
we get to a stage where we can,

29:47.240 --> 29:50.320
there's an access to the interior through justification,

29:50.320 --> 29:52.680
which they need to start talking, okay?

29:52.680 --> 29:54.680
And little kids don't have to deal with this as much

29:54.680 --> 29:56.280
but as you start to get older,

29:56.280 --> 29:59.600
you can then the cognitive capacities of justification

29:59.600 --> 30:00.920
start to say, well, okay,

30:00.920 --> 30:02.880
I know mom wants to hear shit from me

30:02.880 --> 30:04.000
or dad wants to hear shit

30:04.000 --> 30:05.640
or my friends want to hear shit

30:05.640 --> 30:06.920
and they can ask me questions.

30:06.920 --> 30:11.760
So then I find myself basically generating a persona,

30:11.760 --> 30:14.840
public justification out here, okay?

30:14.840 --> 30:16.880
And that creates then the opportunity

30:16.880 --> 30:18.560
for imposter syndromes,

30:18.560 --> 30:21.640
which then emerge in middle to older childhood,

30:21.640 --> 30:24.480
where you actually start to then create a public face,

30:24.480 --> 30:26.280
a persona, that's young call,

30:26.280 --> 30:30.120
that the mask that you then wear in relation

30:30.120 --> 30:31.520
and you realize you do that

30:31.520 --> 30:33.240
for social influence purposes,

30:33.240 --> 30:34.800
meaning because you wear the mask,

30:34.800 --> 30:37.000
you avoid their judgment in a particular way

30:37.000 --> 30:38.840
or you obtain their praise.

30:38.840 --> 30:39.680
But at the same time,

30:39.680 --> 30:43.840
it creates a fundamental social versus core self-split

30:43.840 --> 30:45.080
because it's like this,

30:45.080 --> 30:48.240
they love me now as a function of the contingencies

30:48.240 --> 30:49.480
that I give them.

30:49.480 --> 30:52.120
But if they really knew me, I'm terrified they wouldn't.

30:52.120 --> 30:54.280
That way I see that all the time in a relationship

30:54.280 --> 30:57.800
to once adolescents start to struggle with mental health

30:57.800 --> 31:01.240
and it creates this very, very brutal dichotomy

31:01.240 --> 31:02.840
and there's no holding environment there

31:02.840 --> 31:04.480
that can be really generated,

31:04.480 --> 31:06.080
that's fundamentally embodied

31:06.080 --> 31:07.400
because you can't really,

31:07.400 --> 31:10.600
you can't bring yourself to test if so you fake it,

31:10.600 --> 31:13.200
but you then don't trust that you would actually be held.

31:13.200 --> 31:15.120
I have many, many clients

31:15.120 --> 31:16.480
who had to work through that process

31:16.480 --> 31:19.600
to afford coherent integration along those lines.

31:20.600 --> 31:23.360
In fact, you were just saying,

31:23.360 --> 31:26.960
because I too, because I work with people one-on-one too

31:26.960 --> 31:29.840
and in so many cases,

31:29.840 --> 31:31.440
like I just started to,

31:31.440 --> 31:33.480
it's at the point where I could just kind of almost

31:33.480 --> 31:35.440
look for it, right?

31:35.440 --> 31:39.040
There's something like life was fine, right?

31:39.040 --> 31:43.000
Everything was fluid, I was loved and then we moved.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.520
And then there was a new school

31:44.520 --> 31:46.400
and then I had to like,

31:46.400 --> 31:48.160
and then there's the socialization, right?

31:48.760 --> 31:51.320
The break with something, some kind of security

31:51.320 --> 31:53.120
and then there in a new social matrix

31:53.120 --> 31:54.840
and then there's all these breakdowns

31:54.840 --> 31:56.840
and on some level, right?

31:56.840 --> 31:57.680
That's,

31:59.560 --> 32:01.720
there, so much of their personality

32:01.720 --> 32:05.400
has been defined in that adaptation, right?

32:05.400 --> 32:07.560
Which has all these dichotomies in it, right?

32:07.560 --> 32:09.600
And that's usually what we end up talking about, right?

32:09.600 --> 32:13.280
Are issues around that fundamental break, yeah.

32:13.280 --> 32:14.880
Totally, exactly.

32:14.880 --> 32:17.280
And then that activates the insecurity

32:17.280 --> 32:19.400
of not being held in the environment.

32:19.400 --> 32:22.160
And then people struggle with various strategies,

32:22.160 --> 32:26.360
testing, defenses, coping strategies, et cetera.

32:26.360 --> 32:29.280
And if they are constrained and limited

32:29.280 --> 32:30.960
and they also lead to additional problems,

32:30.960 --> 32:33.280
you get an entrenched maladaptive problem

32:33.280 --> 32:34.840
of a social phobia,

32:34.840 --> 32:37.600
a fundamental sense of insecurity and inability

32:37.600 --> 32:38.960
to articulate what's going on,

32:38.960 --> 32:40.840
a hyper-reactivity of the vulnerability

32:40.840 --> 32:42.640
because you're always on edge.

32:42.640 --> 32:45.520
And then of course that makes you very difficult

32:45.520 --> 32:49.760
to then engender the risks that are necessary

32:49.760 --> 32:52.120
and they perceive them often as great risks

32:52.120 --> 32:54.440
to then go out and try to find

32:54.440 --> 32:57.240
a new secure identification matrix.

32:57.240 --> 33:01.440
Identification matrix is the self-world identity process.

33:01.440 --> 33:03.120
So these are the elements of the world.

33:03.120 --> 33:05.160
It's my map of that, not necessarily conscious,

33:05.160 --> 33:07.000
but just intuitively the way you map it.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.120
My place in that world

33:08.120 --> 33:09.280
and this is what's gonna happen to me

33:09.280 --> 33:12.280
if I behave in X, Y, and Z ways.

33:12.280 --> 33:14.160
Right, right, right.

33:16.280 --> 33:21.280
You know, the sense about, right,

33:22.360 --> 33:25.360
one of the things that's interesting to me about this

33:25.360 --> 33:29.040
is this, you can see through all of this

33:29.040 --> 33:32.480
that, you know, I often talk about it like this.

33:32.480 --> 33:35.600
It's like, you know, do you,

33:35.600 --> 33:39.200
I don't know about all of biology,

33:39.200 --> 33:42.760
but like in terms of mammals,

33:42.760 --> 33:44.920
I don't think there's anything more helpless

33:44.920 --> 33:47.000
than the human infant, is there?

33:47.000 --> 33:48.280
Not even close.

33:48.280 --> 33:50.120
Not even close.

33:50.120 --> 33:52.080
And what's interesting about this,

33:52.080 --> 33:53.840
this has always struck me as like,

33:55.000 --> 33:57.440
we all start off like that.

33:57.440 --> 34:02.440
Like the way we start is completely dependent,

34:02.800 --> 34:06.640
completely helpless in every dimension

34:06.640 --> 34:07.800
that you can imagine.

34:07.800 --> 34:08.640
Totally.

34:09.560 --> 34:14.560
And who's going to Mars, right?

34:14.960 --> 34:17.640
Who's on top of the food chain?

34:17.640 --> 34:19.560
Who's, right?

34:19.560 --> 34:21.680
Who's the one, as far as we can tell,

34:21.680 --> 34:23.080
I mean, who knows ultimately,

34:23.080 --> 34:24.200
but as far as we can tell,

34:24.200 --> 34:28.560
who's the one that caught a sight of its own existence

34:28.560 --> 34:32.360
and then can relate back with that existence, right?

34:32.360 --> 34:35.160
Even that, you can feel a kind of vulnerability

34:35.160 --> 34:39.040
or transparency or porousness going on.

34:39.040 --> 34:39.920
And I think about this,

34:39.920 --> 34:42.560
and this is where it starts to get kind of ontologically

34:42.560 --> 34:43.720
where I want to bring this in.

34:43.720 --> 34:46.040
And I'm just curious how this weaves together

34:47.360 --> 34:50.800
is, so there's a deep vulnerability

34:50.800 --> 34:55.800
that seems to afford the highest levels of theoria, right?

34:58.280 --> 35:03.280
Of mystical realization, right?

35:06.840 --> 35:08.480
Deep conceptualization, right?

35:08.480 --> 35:13.240
These unitary things and abstractions

35:13.960 --> 35:15.360
and all of that, right?

35:17.640 --> 35:22.640
And in one sense, there's this helplessness

35:24.240 --> 35:26.920
that also, right?

35:26.920 --> 35:29.320
And in this relationship with that vulnerability,

35:29.320 --> 35:30.800
in its hold-it, right?

35:30.800 --> 35:31.720
Yes.

35:31.720 --> 35:36.560
And it's all, so if you think about this statement,

35:36.560 --> 35:41.560
I think it's Jesus, I think he says this in the Bible,

35:41.640 --> 35:43.360
I'm so not up on that stuff,

35:43.360 --> 35:48.160
but where he says, the meek shall inherit the earth.

35:48.160 --> 35:49.720
You think about that statement, right?

35:49.720 --> 35:53.520
Such a weird thing at face value,

35:53.520 --> 35:56.680
the meek shall inherit the earth.

35:56.680 --> 35:59.520
When you think about it like that, right?

35:59.520 --> 36:01.160
Like in the terms we're talking about,

36:01.160 --> 36:03.600
you can start to get where you're talking about.

36:03.600 --> 36:06.200
Like that there is a way that,

36:06.200 --> 36:09.240
and I think what he's basically saying is,

36:10.240 --> 36:14.160
the meek, when loved, right?

36:14.160 --> 36:19.160
That can potentuate this vulnerability

36:19.760 --> 36:22.840
into something very, very powerful, right?

36:24.960 --> 36:29.280
And so there's that part of it that's just,

36:29.280 --> 36:30.600
it seems I'm wondering,

36:30.600 --> 36:32.560
it's like there's something ontologically

36:32.560 --> 36:35.680
about vulnerability and holding, right?

36:35.680 --> 36:37.720
That is expressed here.

36:38.680 --> 36:43.680
And then also, but it also strikes me that as human,

36:44.040 --> 36:47.080
oops, sorry about that.

36:47.080 --> 36:47.920
That's fine.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.040
I've got to figure out a way so when it calls,

36:51.040 --> 36:52.400
it doesn't blank out.

36:55.200 --> 36:56.520
You know, it's like, yeah,

36:56.520 --> 37:00.400
so that something about the essence of being human, right?

37:00.400 --> 37:03.200
Is really, really tied with being vulnerable.

37:03.200 --> 37:05.680
But like, I don't know anybody.

37:05.680 --> 37:07.160
In fact, I've been teaching courses

37:07.560 --> 37:11.400
for years and I've never had anyone sit,

37:11.400 --> 37:13.160
not once have I ever had anybody say,

37:13.160 --> 37:15.200
respond to me when I've said,

37:15.200 --> 37:17.880
well, hey, maybe this is a good time to be vulnerable,

37:17.880 --> 37:20.800
where they're like, oh, I'm so,

37:20.800 --> 37:22.960
I was, someone had to say it, right?

37:22.960 --> 37:24.120
Thank God.

37:24.120 --> 37:27.760
No, it's always this sense of like, oh, like, all right,

37:27.760 --> 37:31.800
right, that on one level,

37:31.800 --> 37:34.720
our humanity seems to be very much

37:34.760 --> 37:37.200
about this deep vulnerability, right?

37:37.200 --> 37:39.880
But there's a level at which it can be,

37:39.880 --> 37:43.200
we can also be exposed, right?

37:43.200 --> 37:45.120
Which is I think what we're really afraid of

37:45.120 --> 37:47.560
when we talk about being afraid of being vulnerable,

37:47.560 --> 37:49.880
but we're really, really afraid of

37:49.880 --> 37:51.520
is we collapse that with being,

37:51.520 --> 37:55.160
with the involuntary sense of being subject

37:55.160 --> 37:57.800
to something in which I'm exposed to,

37:57.800 --> 37:59.560
which I think is really, really different.

37:59.560 --> 38:01.560
Vulnerability seems to, at least in my mind,

38:01.560 --> 38:06.560
has more of a sense of I'm voluntary, right?

38:07.040 --> 38:09.680
There's some sense of I'm willing, right,

38:09.680 --> 38:12.160
to be vulnerable, both will, positive sense,

38:12.160 --> 38:15.760
and willing, right, and the generative sense.

38:17.320 --> 38:22.320
And, but when that holding environment, right, breaks down,

38:27.280 --> 38:30.160
and we develop defenses,

38:30.160 --> 38:31.880
and so I don't wanna be human,

38:31.880 --> 38:34.880
so what I do is I put a shell around myself.

38:34.880 --> 38:37.480
But here's the paradox, it's like the moment,

38:37.480 --> 38:39.320
the moment I put a shell around myself,

38:39.320 --> 38:42.880
and this is why our psychological defense

38:42.880 --> 38:45.680
is on one level work, but the cost to them are great.

38:45.680 --> 38:46.880
I think it has to do with this,

38:46.880 --> 38:48.760
is because the moment I put a shell around myself

38:48.760 --> 38:51.880
is the moment I become brittle, right?

38:51.880 --> 38:56.880
So, and it seems to me that this relationship to,

38:57.880 --> 39:02.200
because on some level, you could say the mystic

39:02.200 --> 39:07.000
realizing on the top of the mountain, realizing being, right?

39:07.000 --> 39:09.560
You could almost see that is in some sense

39:09.560 --> 39:14.440
a profound relationship with his own vulnerability,

39:14.440 --> 39:16.040
such that he's so vulnerable,

39:16.040 --> 39:19.240
that he's vulnerable to the deepest depths of himself,

39:19.240 --> 39:21.000
and transparent to it,

39:21.000 --> 39:24.120
such that he realizes the ultimate depth of oneness,

39:24.160 --> 39:26.080
and then paradoxically,

39:26.080 --> 39:27.880
in that full realization of vulnerability,

39:27.880 --> 39:29.520
he's invulnerable, right?

39:29.520 --> 39:30.840
Because he's everything, right?

39:30.840 --> 39:32.800
We think about that as a symbol.

39:32.800 --> 39:33.680
Yeah.

39:33.680 --> 39:36.480
And this kind of, this ontological sense,

39:36.480 --> 39:38.000
this verticality, right,

39:38.000 --> 39:42.280
that has to do with holding time vulnerability,

39:43.280 --> 39:44.720
bringing those things together.

39:47.720 --> 39:49.760
What stands out for you in that?

39:49.760 --> 39:50.920
Well, a couple of things.

39:51.880 --> 39:55.120
So, yes, I think you're, first off,

39:55.120 --> 40:00.120
we should highlight the vulnerability aspect of our nature.

40:00.920 --> 40:03.400
That we're born into the world vulnerable.

40:05.160 --> 40:07.360
And then that affords us a wonderful set

40:07.360 --> 40:12.360
of both opportunities and serious risks at multiple levels.

40:13.000 --> 40:15.280
And then our potentialities are structured

40:15.280 --> 40:19.160
around trying to mitigate and navigate those risks.

40:19.280 --> 40:20.400
Okay.

40:20.400 --> 40:22.600
And potentially can be realized

40:22.600 --> 40:24.400
through a huge amount of affordance.

40:24.400 --> 40:25.720
Okay, so let's just talk this through.

40:25.720 --> 40:27.520
So, I think the bottom line,

40:27.520 --> 40:30.080
why are we so vulnerable from an evolutionary perspective?

40:30.080 --> 40:31.440
I think the fundamental answer

40:31.440 --> 40:34.600
is because we're incredibly plastic, okay?

40:34.600 --> 40:36.960
I was just listening to Heather hiring on Jim Rutt,

40:36.960 --> 40:39.320
and she was like, from hunter-gatherer perspective,

40:39.320 --> 40:41.480
we're sort of the niche generalizers,

40:41.480 --> 40:43.360
meaning that we can bounce from,

40:43.360 --> 40:44.840
one of the things about it is we can bounce

40:44.840 --> 40:47.080
from niche to niche, okay?

40:47.080 --> 40:51.480
And learn strategies in a wide variety of addition niches.

40:51.480 --> 40:54.360
I mean, that's what our cognitive language,

40:54.360 --> 40:56.040
collective intelligence capacities,

40:56.040 --> 40:58.840
our creative capacities afford us that.

40:58.840 --> 40:59.920
How the hell do you, though,

40:59.920 --> 41:02.080
get all the cognitive gadgets

41:02.080 --> 41:03.600
and the availability to do that?

41:03.600 --> 41:08.600
Well, super long time of development, you know?

41:08.760 --> 41:11.240
And the other thing that probably the mechanics

41:11.240 --> 41:12.280
of the size of the head,

41:12.280 --> 41:13.960
then that requires to hold the brain,

41:13.960 --> 41:15.720
and then the birthing process is like,

41:15.720 --> 41:17.960
well, you can't stay in there forever.

41:17.960 --> 41:20.880
We're already have serious problems at birth.

41:20.880 --> 41:23.080
It's a hell of a process, right?

41:23.080 --> 41:24.120
Yeah.

41:24.120 --> 41:25.880
So you got to get the thing out of there

41:25.880 --> 41:29.880
really before it's ready, basically.

41:29.880 --> 41:31.320
And now all of a sudden you have this really,

41:31.320 --> 41:36.040
neotony is the extended period of neonatal development.

41:36.040 --> 41:39.400
And Steven J. Gould points out that this is a really,

41:39.400 --> 41:42.280
almost certainly a central feature of our development.

41:42.280 --> 41:44.800
So nature basically says, all right,

41:44.840 --> 41:46.400
we're going to get systems

41:46.400 --> 41:50.960
that can have this unbelievable cognitive learning flexibility

41:50.960 --> 41:52.320
that they can learn repertoires

41:52.320 --> 41:54.560
and then repertoire off a top so that they,

41:54.560 --> 41:56.480
most animals just learn repertoires.

41:56.480 --> 41:58.520
We earn repertoires on top of our repertoires.

41:58.520 --> 42:00.920
They've put them all together in evolutionary new ways

42:00.920 --> 42:02.480
through our learning.

42:02.480 --> 42:04.600
And then now we justify on top of that.

42:04.600 --> 42:05.760
So we are really do,

42:05.760 --> 42:08.560
our behavioral flexibility is really in a class by its set,

42:08.560 --> 42:09.400
okay?

42:09.400 --> 42:13.040
To get there, the system has to have be able to download

42:13.080 --> 42:14.880
and manipulate all that.

42:14.880 --> 42:18.560
Plus, so then it comes out very, very vulnerable.

42:18.560 --> 42:21.520
So now let's think about what that means about our condition.

42:21.520 --> 42:25.840
If I am fed and held well, okay,

42:25.840 --> 42:29.080
I can then grow and network into a collective intelligence

42:29.080 --> 42:30.640
that is enormous amount of power

42:30.640 --> 42:33.360
and be a part of something belonging.

42:34.560 --> 42:36.560
Actually, my doctoral student is probably going to do

42:36.560 --> 42:40.560
a dissertation on suicide called the ontology of belonging

42:40.560 --> 42:43.600
and suicidal behavior in adolescence, okay?

42:43.600 --> 42:48.080
And basically it's the ecology and ontology of belonging

42:48.080 --> 42:52.200
in her estimation that affords coherent integration.

42:52.200 --> 42:54.440
And what gets deviated for so many people

42:54.440 --> 42:55.720
is the breakdown in that.

42:55.720 --> 42:58.400
And then an internalized critical looping

42:58.400 --> 43:00.760
that then alienates and leads to psychic

43:00.760 --> 43:04.400
and then a crash and burn and have alienation.

43:04.400 --> 43:06.120
And you can see then that you have this whole,

43:06.120 --> 43:07.480
all of this potential,

43:07.480 --> 43:09.520
first off, you might get neglected and abused.

43:09.520 --> 43:11.600
That's horrifying, right?

43:11.600 --> 43:15.240
Or you might get situated so that you're in a contingency

43:15.240 --> 43:17.000
where you have to fake it,

43:17.000 --> 43:18.560
but then you feel empty inside.

43:18.560 --> 43:22.840
That's another sort of developmental line,

43:22.840 --> 43:24.440
an aberrant or atypical

43:24.440 --> 43:26.480
or less than fulfilling developmental line.

43:26.480 --> 43:28.960
And then there's this enormous potential

43:28.960 --> 43:32.960
to grow in connection with each other in nature

43:32.960 --> 43:36.080
in a fulfilled way because of the enormous plasticity

43:36.080 --> 43:39.440
and learning potential of the structure of the system.

43:39.760 --> 43:43.960
So our developmental trajectories are enormously variable.

43:45.400 --> 43:47.880
And so the idea that we're sort of like trying to track,

43:47.880 --> 43:49.280
oh, guys, is this a bad sign?

43:49.280 --> 43:50.480
Is this a good sign?

43:50.480 --> 43:54.880
Where are we and have potentials that afford that?

43:54.880 --> 43:56.160
The other thing that I was thinking of

43:56.160 --> 43:57.000
when you were talking,

43:57.000 --> 43:59.120
I hooked up with a theorist a while ago

44:00.720 --> 44:05.320
who really centered on this core split of our potential.

44:05.320 --> 44:09.240
He actually called his framework called the one divide, okay?

44:09.240 --> 44:12.080
And he basically argued that birth and early events

44:12.080 --> 44:15.080
inevitably result in trauma, okay?

44:15.080 --> 44:18.480
And then you have the activation

44:18.480 --> 44:21.560
of the low relational value, low social influence,

44:21.560 --> 44:25.560
panic of abandonment, death, desertion, okay?

44:25.560 --> 44:28.120
And that core panic is something

44:28.120 --> 44:31.680
that you are really programmed to like void.

44:31.680 --> 44:34.640
I was like, oh my God, am I gonna be seen

44:34.640 --> 44:38.400
and devalued and dejected and removed, okay?

44:38.400 --> 44:41.600
So then what happens then is the self system

44:41.600 --> 44:44.160
begins to model what makes me vulnerable

44:44.160 --> 44:47.880
and then how do I create a defensive self-structure

44:47.880 --> 44:51.320
that's trying to compensate and avoid and control

44:51.320 --> 44:52.360
in an instrumental way,

44:52.360 --> 44:55.120
the avoidance and discovery of that abandonment.

44:56.160 --> 44:57.920
And he argues that many, many people,

44:57.920 --> 44:58.760
and I think this is true,

44:58.760 --> 45:03.440
many people then live their lives essentially on the cusp.

45:03.440 --> 45:05.480
This is really a felt sense of insecurity

45:06.120 --> 45:10.000
you're building a defended character armor structure,

45:10.000 --> 45:11.600
Wright talks about character armor

45:11.600 --> 45:12.920
from a psychodynamic perspective,

45:12.920 --> 45:15.240
you build this up and the function of that

45:15.240 --> 45:19.200
is to avoid the terror with the fear

45:19.200 --> 45:21.480
that if you fail to do this, you would be revealed

45:21.480 --> 45:22.320
and you'd be rejected

45:22.320 --> 45:25.680
and you have a fundamental abandonment, okay?

45:25.680 --> 45:27.720
The structure of that,

45:27.720 --> 45:30.120
if you think the vertical integration structure of that,

45:30.120 --> 45:33.040
it's basically, it's an empty dark core

45:33.040 --> 45:34.960
that is speaking to you constantly

45:34.960 --> 45:37.280
and the rest of your character structure

45:37.280 --> 45:42.280
then is a compensation to try to avoid falling into something.

45:42.720 --> 45:43.840
Yeah.

45:43.840 --> 45:44.680
Yeah.

45:44.680 --> 45:45.520
Think about that.

45:45.520 --> 45:46.840
Yeah, it's like, exactly.

45:46.840 --> 45:48.480
Like, ah, you know.

45:48.480 --> 45:51.080
And that is, and now I need to work really hard

45:51.080 --> 45:56.080
to build stuff and then the felt sense of existence is,

45:56.080 --> 45:57.560
how far can I stay away from it?

45:57.560 --> 45:59.120
But everything then you're doing

45:59.120 --> 46:01.120
is actually negatively reinforcing.

46:01.120 --> 46:02.760
And what that means is you do shit

46:02.760 --> 46:05.880
so that you avoid the potential horror of consequence.

46:05.880 --> 46:09.440
And it takes a little bit of the edge off periodically

46:09.440 --> 46:11.280
but then you have to keep doing stuff

46:11.280 --> 46:14.200
to keep the abyss falling away.

46:14.200 --> 46:16.840
I've met a lot of people that live their lives like that

46:16.840 --> 46:18.840
and it is, it's pretty tragic

46:18.840 --> 46:21.640
because the entire structure of being

46:21.640 --> 46:22.760
then is like, it's just,

46:22.760 --> 46:25.280
how do I avoid falling into abyss

46:25.280 --> 46:29.080
as opposed to how do I live in the divine bliss?

46:29.080 --> 46:29.920
Okay.

46:29.920 --> 46:30.760
Yeah.

46:30.760 --> 46:32.880
The fullness, not the negation.

46:32.880 --> 46:33.720
Exactly.

46:33.720 --> 46:35.760
It's like, oh my God.

46:35.760 --> 46:38.240
You mean to say that I can be valued

46:38.240 --> 46:40.400
and value that into my animal body,

46:40.400 --> 46:45.120
into my soul and my cells and feel at oneness

46:45.120 --> 46:48.720
with the sense of divine, with the ultimate purpose,

46:48.720 --> 46:53.080
with the negentropic complex, coordinated,

46:53.080 --> 46:54.160
integrated processes.

46:54.160 --> 46:56.920
That's my spirit into my system of justification.

46:56.920 --> 46:57.920
Then you drop into that

46:57.920 --> 46:59.440
and you just feel a perspectival,

46:59.440 --> 47:04.240
a heart flood with a sense of appreciation, gratitude, love,

47:04.240 --> 47:06.800
awe, all of that, and then down into the body.

47:06.800 --> 47:09.640
And that is, then that's the true self,

47:09.640 --> 47:11.760
what he calls the true self integration.

47:11.760 --> 47:14.760
And it creates the basically the stack

47:14.760 --> 47:17.240
of an affirming belief system in spirit

47:17.240 --> 47:18.800
that has some sense making,

47:18.800 --> 47:20.920
that makes sense of the heart that's known and valued,

47:20.920 --> 47:23.560
that's into the body that's felt held and secure

47:23.560 --> 47:25.160
in the environment itself.

47:25.160 --> 47:26.960
And then I think one of the things

47:26.960 --> 47:29.040
that we should be really emphasizing,

47:29.040 --> 47:30.800
my friend Rob Scott emphasized this,

47:30.800 --> 47:34.440
calls it the fundamental shift is those moments

47:34.440 --> 47:39.440
of being itself are the awe-inspiring glory

47:40.800 --> 47:45.800
of being itself and to be just in the moment of awareness,

47:46.280 --> 47:47.640
of fundamental awareness

47:47.640 --> 47:50.560
and to cultivate the taste of that beauty,

47:50.560 --> 47:53.120
of awareness itself.

47:53.120 --> 47:54.800
I mean, I find that to be,

47:54.800 --> 47:56.800
and then you get back to the whole leisure place,

47:56.800 --> 48:00.920
is sort of like to have the opportunity to simply be,

48:00.920 --> 48:01.760
right?

48:01.760 --> 48:06.760
And then to be and to have that beingness

48:06.800 --> 48:11.160
be so fill your existence in the world.

48:11.160 --> 48:12.320
I mean, that's a beautiful thing.

48:12.320 --> 48:13.880
I mean, that's a beautiful thing.

48:13.880 --> 48:16.600
And I think there's an opportunity for us to achieve that.

48:16.600 --> 48:17.640
He certainly makes this case.

48:17.640 --> 48:19.400
I believe this too, that we just,

48:19.400 --> 48:22.560
we don't so, we socialize towards instrumental control

48:22.560 --> 48:24.160
and doing, you know?

48:24.160 --> 48:26.720
And can I do more and do more and do more and get more

48:27.480 --> 48:29.840
and the whole, and then you can rest

48:29.840 --> 48:33.040
and or watch your damn, you know, whatever is fun for you.

48:33.040 --> 48:36.200
And it's like, you're missing the entire point

48:36.200 --> 48:38.160
of being in becoming modes of, you know,

48:38.160 --> 48:40.800
we should be working when certainly you have to

48:40.800 --> 48:42.840
at some level, it's not like you don't do,

48:42.840 --> 48:46.800
but the cultivation of that fundamental being in the world

48:46.800 --> 48:50.320
and being held by the world in a moment of the infinite now

48:50.320 --> 48:52.160
and a particular kind of presence

48:52.160 --> 48:54.320
to be able to taste that, to be present with that.

48:54.400 --> 48:56.640
I think that's a, I've certainly grown

48:56.640 --> 48:58.760
in the last five years in that mode.

48:58.760 --> 49:00.840
And, you know, even as a clinical psychologist,

49:00.840 --> 49:03.720
we aren't socialized too much to orient to that.

49:03.720 --> 49:05.320
I think that's a great,

49:05.320 --> 49:07.440
many wisdom traditions do orient that way.

49:07.440 --> 49:10.000
And I've really felt fortunate

49:10.000 --> 49:12.440
that I've been hanging out with people over the last five years

49:12.440 --> 49:15.080
and really shine the light on that in a rich way.

49:15.080 --> 49:15.920
Right.

49:16.960 --> 49:19.120
Well, one of the things that is you've been describing

49:19.120 --> 49:20.640
all of this, it's just been,

49:20.760 --> 49:24.880
it's a marvel to realize our pre-reflective

49:24.880 --> 49:29.880
organismic sense knows this relationship with folding.

49:31.840 --> 49:34.320
It's embodied, embedded, right?

49:34.320 --> 49:38.920
There's a deep, seems super intelligent to me.

49:40.520 --> 49:43.320
It's network of is intelligibility

49:43.320 --> 49:48.240
that seems to somehow be oriented to this, right?

49:48.240 --> 49:50.040
So just this idea of that,

49:50.080 --> 49:52.000
because I've seen this over and over and over again,

49:52.000 --> 49:54.360
where, you know, like it is, it's really true.

49:54.360 --> 49:58.600
It's like, I think it's set up in such a way

49:58.600 --> 50:00.600
and it says a lot to do with nihilism.

50:00.600 --> 50:02.400
It says a lot to do with the meeting crisis,

50:02.400 --> 50:03.240
all of this, right?

50:03.240 --> 50:04.800
Where we're not really,

50:05.880 --> 50:09.080
we don't even consider that we don't have

50:09.080 --> 50:12.800
an understanding of being that isn't contingent, right?

50:12.800 --> 50:15.000
There's not this sense of contingency,

50:15.000 --> 50:19.480
the sense of, that there is, there are principles, right?

50:19.560 --> 50:23.200
That in some sense govern,

50:23.200 --> 50:26.200
you know, govern the orderliness

50:26.200 --> 50:29.640
or make it possible for orderliness.

50:29.640 --> 50:32.320
And in some sense, philosophy, right?

50:32.320 --> 50:34.480
Philosophy in the deepest sense of the word

50:34.480 --> 50:37.560
was really in some sense about getting close to

50:37.560 --> 50:40.040
and beholding those principles, right?

50:41.480 --> 50:45.160
That in some sense, the principle itself,

50:45.160 --> 50:47.120
you can't, what's interesting about is,

50:47.120 --> 50:49.160
the principle itself is like, you cannot,

50:49.200 --> 50:52.160
it's one of those things where you cannot ultimately,

50:53.880 --> 50:57.280
you can't put into language, right?

50:57.280 --> 50:59.160
I think, yes, it's the way, you know,

50:59.160 --> 51:01.560
you go to Taoism catchers, this is pretty early.

51:01.560 --> 51:03.440
I think when they say the Tao is not the Tao,

51:03.440 --> 51:07.120
it's a participatory, perspectival presencing

51:07.120 --> 51:10.840
that is definitely at this animal heart,

51:10.840 --> 51:13.000
you know, felt sense of being it.

51:13.000 --> 51:15.720
And then, and also I think it often is,

51:15.720 --> 51:17.240
when we have our transcendent states,

51:17.240 --> 51:18.640
it's trans-justificatory.

51:18.640 --> 51:20.800
So in virtually all mystic states, it's, you know,

51:20.800 --> 51:23.440
the ego dies or dissipates that little,

51:23.440 --> 51:26.240
the narrating regulator or seeking justification,

51:26.240 --> 51:28.560
control and legitimacy, right?

51:28.560 --> 51:30.120
That is crucial.

51:30.120 --> 51:33.240
But it is a particular kind of mode

51:33.240 --> 51:35.320
that I think our modern style is like,

51:35.320 --> 51:38.240
way over-activated in a particular way.

51:38.240 --> 51:39.480
Oh, totally.

51:39.480 --> 51:41.960
And then it kind of controls the shit

51:41.960 --> 51:44.120
and is trying to regulate and make sure everything

51:44.120 --> 51:46.200
fits in the damn boxes that it's trying to control.

51:46.760 --> 51:48.800
Anxious or pissed off if it doesn't, you know,

51:48.800 --> 51:51.080
win its justification in a particular way.

51:51.080 --> 51:53.440
And that is, that's definitely not

51:54.680 --> 51:57.320
the coherent stacked integration.

51:57.320 --> 51:59.240
In fact, that's just one piece of it

51:59.240 --> 52:01.720
and you need to be underneath it and above it

52:03.160 --> 52:06.400
rather than just trying to use it as the primary,

52:06.400 --> 52:08.680
you know, propositional reasoning network,

52:08.680 --> 52:10.920
which is really modernity, you know,

52:10.920 --> 52:13.560
basically started to just said that in many ways.

52:13.560 --> 52:15.280
It was like, wow, we're gonna reason our way

52:15.280 --> 52:17.400
through justification and science into this.

52:17.400 --> 52:19.920
I know Ian McGillchrist makes a number of points

52:19.920 --> 52:21.600
in these directions and I agree.

52:21.600 --> 52:23.480
Yeah, right.

52:23.480 --> 52:25.960
And this sense of witnessing,

52:25.960 --> 52:27.240
and I'm sure you've probably experienced

52:27.240 --> 52:31.480
this being a therapist too of that.

52:31.480 --> 52:32.560
It sounds like I would imagine

52:32.560 --> 52:33.800
that therapy is a lot like this,

52:33.800 --> 52:37.120
but just when you start to get real about,

52:37.120 --> 52:39.560
people start to have these insights that,

52:40.560 --> 52:44.080
and it's usually when their defensive strategies

52:44.960 --> 52:49.680
don't like actually start the balance,

52:49.680 --> 52:52.280
the benefit of that goes down, right?

52:52.280 --> 52:53.800
Right.

52:53.800 --> 52:54.960
Because usually I've noticed this

52:54.960 --> 52:57.640
with like kind of psychological forms of defensiveness,

52:57.640 --> 53:00.800
is it creates this immediate sense of safety,

53:00.800 --> 53:03.440
but in a way that numbs you

53:03.440 --> 53:06.280
or has you not see the long-term consequences.

53:06.280 --> 53:08.520
And I think that thing that you were talking about,

53:08.520 --> 53:11.240
this nemo, this emptiness inside,

53:11.240 --> 53:15.080
in which if you fall into that, it's all over, right?

53:15.080 --> 53:16.720
That's the felt sense.

53:16.720 --> 53:21.280
Then you live such that you're not that,

53:21.280 --> 53:24.400
and then you articulate a whole way of being

53:24.400 --> 53:26.480
that's about an avoidance of that, right?

53:26.480 --> 53:30.800
But then you're dependent on that in some weird sense.

53:30.800 --> 53:34.680
So you go in with people and you start talking about this,

53:34.680 --> 53:38.320
and you say, well, what would happen if you just didn't do that?

53:38.320 --> 53:39.320
Yeah, totally.

53:40.200 --> 53:41.960
Like in this anxiety comes up,

53:41.960 --> 53:44.680
and then there's a way where it's like you take something

53:44.680 --> 53:47.600
to be with the anxiety and the annihilation

53:47.600 --> 53:51.480
because there's a deep mistake going on in there, right?

53:51.480 --> 53:52.800
Right, exactly.

53:52.800 --> 53:55.600
But when people can tolerate it, right,

53:55.600 --> 53:56.840
and the conditions are right,

53:56.840 --> 53:59.440
and they can tolerate it and they can open to it,

53:59.440 --> 54:03.480
that and go through that initial, it's like feeling,

54:03.480 --> 54:07.800
it's like that level of experience is so, it's so intense, right?

54:07.800 --> 54:12.280
It's like, imagine, it's like the feeling,

54:12.280 --> 54:15.320
it's like the most haunting, nauseating,

54:16.800 --> 54:19.840
like everything unattractive that you could imagine

54:19.840 --> 54:22.080
in your very pores is the recognition

54:22.080 --> 54:24.400
that that's all that there is, that's what it feels like, right?

54:24.400 --> 54:27.560
It's like total awfulness, right?

54:27.560 --> 54:29.160
In the deep sense of the word,

54:29.160 --> 54:32.360
and it takes something to even get any leverage

54:32.360 --> 54:34.440
to be able to turn towards it, right?

54:34.440 --> 54:37.320
Absolutely, it takes a little bit.

54:37.320 --> 54:40.200
But when you do, there is something though,

54:40.200 --> 54:42.920
because, and I'm kind of getting this through this conversation

54:42.920 --> 54:45.320
in a different way,

54:45.320 --> 54:49.600
that I don't know if I quite saw it like so congruently here,

54:49.600 --> 54:54.600
is that we have our nervous system

54:55.960 --> 55:00.960
is really knows how to open to that deep openness, right?

55:03.840 --> 55:05.640
It's like something catches,

55:05.640 --> 55:08.440
like if you can feel through that barrier, right?

55:08.440 --> 55:11.280
And you can like, at some point, you're like,

55:11.280 --> 55:13.880
all right, non-being, ah!

55:13.880 --> 55:16.720
Right?

55:16.720 --> 55:17.880
Totally, yeah.

55:17.880 --> 55:19.160
At some point, you're like,

55:20.360 --> 55:23.160
well, there is a lot of room.

55:23.160 --> 55:24.360
It is kind of spacious in there.

55:24.360 --> 55:27.120
In fact, there's like an affording spaciousness in like,

55:27.120 --> 55:30.240
but your nervous system knows how to,

55:31.240 --> 55:35.720
how to take in that in the most generative sense, right?

55:35.720 --> 55:36.720
Yes.

55:36.720 --> 55:37.720
Yeah.

55:37.720 --> 55:38.720
If it's, yeah.

55:38.720 --> 55:40.720
Right, it has that potential, okay?

55:40.720 --> 55:41.720
Yeah.

55:41.720 --> 55:43.720
It also, the reason people get all tangled up

55:43.720 --> 55:47.240
is precisely because the way that egoic narrator

55:47.240 --> 55:48.720
frames it all, okay?

55:48.720 --> 55:49.720
Yeah.

55:49.720 --> 55:50.720
If you frame it in a particular way,

55:50.720 --> 55:53.240
and you do have a core anxiety thing,

55:53.240 --> 55:55.240
and then you get a lot of reinforcement,

55:55.240 --> 55:56.720
that this in structure,

55:56.720 --> 55:58.720
because the system basically is reading this,

55:59.720 --> 56:02.720
is that this is annihilation itself, okay?

56:02.720 --> 56:03.720
Yeah.

56:03.720 --> 56:05.720
And then you build all the justification around that.

56:05.720 --> 56:09.720
And then what you, if you do it in the right way,

56:09.720 --> 56:12.720
and afford the person to bring to bear

56:12.720 --> 56:14.720
what that annihilation actually means,

56:14.720 --> 56:16.720
at first it's terrifying, right?

56:16.720 --> 56:17.720
Yeah.

56:17.720 --> 56:18.720
But you're right.

56:18.720 --> 56:20.720
If the opening of what this might mean

56:20.720 --> 56:22.720
and what might be on the other side of it

56:22.720 --> 56:24.720
is afforded to the individual,

56:24.720 --> 56:27.720
and they can hold the egoic defenses off

56:27.720 --> 56:30.720
or participate in a flow that don't lead

56:30.720 --> 56:31.720
to the reciprocal narrowing

56:31.720 --> 56:33.720
and the need to escape in safety,

56:33.720 --> 56:36.720
but actually get present and take the step off

56:36.720 --> 56:39.720
into sort of like what appears to be the abyss.

56:39.720 --> 56:40.720
And then it's like, oh!

56:40.720 --> 56:42.720
And then you're like, huh.

56:42.720 --> 56:43.720
You know?

56:43.720 --> 56:48.720
Here I am not meeting up my dad's standards,

56:48.720 --> 56:50.720
and here I am not being this,

56:50.720 --> 56:52.720
and here I am being the person that's rejected,

56:52.720 --> 56:55.720
and here I am, and here I still am.

56:55.720 --> 56:58.720
And here I am like so many other people,

56:58.720 --> 57:01.720
and then here I am like living my life,

57:01.720 --> 57:04.720
and then it's just like, and then here I am living.

57:04.720 --> 57:06.720
And then it's like, well, isn't this fascinating

57:06.720 --> 57:09.720
that this is all part of the drama, you know?

57:09.720 --> 57:11.720
And then all of a sudden the relationship to this

57:11.720 --> 57:14.720
is instead of the doer, controller, manipulator,

57:14.720 --> 57:17.720
avoider, defender, it's just the beer, you know?

57:17.720 --> 57:19.720
It's just sort of like, huh.

57:19.720 --> 57:22.720
And of course that is the, that shift when I see it.

57:23.720 --> 57:26.720
And you're like, you start noticing like, what is this am?

57:26.720 --> 57:27.720
Yeah.

57:27.720 --> 57:28.720
The am doesn't seem to,

57:28.720 --> 57:30.720
if you follow me around everywhere,

57:30.720 --> 57:31.720
what is this am, right?

57:31.720 --> 57:32.720
There you go.

57:32.720 --> 57:34.720
Oh, close one day.

57:34.720 --> 57:36.720
There's the beginning of all of it.

57:36.720 --> 57:37.720
Yeah, of the whole new vibe.

57:37.720 --> 57:40.720
Yeah, you start to make that fundamental shift.

57:40.720 --> 57:41.720
And then I think that, you know,

57:41.720 --> 57:46.720
to coach people into the mode of fulfillment,

57:46.720 --> 57:48.720
you know, what is fundamental fulfillment?

57:48.720 --> 57:50.720
And certainly from my vantage point, you know,

57:50.720 --> 57:55.720
it is in the now of, of, of existence in that felt sense

57:55.720 --> 57:59.720
of beingness, being and becoming, the doing is crucial,

57:59.720 --> 58:01.720
but it's, that's means to end shit.

58:01.720 --> 58:05.720
This fundamentally is the eudaimonic point, you know,

58:05.720 --> 58:09.720
that affords the particular capacity,

58:09.720 --> 58:11.720
whether it's by some design, design,

58:11.720 --> 58:14.720
or at least just a hell of a fortunate system

58:14.720 --> 58:17.720
towards neg entropy that affords us what it is like to be

58:17.720 --> 58:20.720
cohering and integrating across multiple levels.

58:20.720 --> 58:23.720
And then to have the reflective felt sense of appreciation for

58:23.720 --> 58:26.720
that, which to me took a little cultivation,

58:26.720 --> 58:28.720
but is now super available.

58:28.720 --> 58:29.720
Yeah.

58:29.720 --> 58:32.720
And that's, that's a nice place.

58:32.720 --> 58:34.720
I remember when you talked about, when you,

58:34.720 --> 58:36.720
when you talked about that of,

58:36.720 --> 58:40.720
I think part of what you mean with that is when you talk about

58:40.720 --> 58:41.720
when wisdom energy,

58:41.720 --> 58:44.720
would you say wisdom energy and in the way you're talking about it,

58:44.720 --> 58:47.720
is in the way you're talking about it, is that, is that.

58:47.720 --> 58:50.720
That felt experience.

58:50.720 --> 58:53.720
Of all of that intelligibility coming through a, like,

58:53.720 --> 58:57.720
you could feel it in your body from the inside out, right?

58:57.720 --> 58:58.720
Exactly.

58:58.720 --> 59:00.720
In a way that you.

59:00.720 --> 59:01.720
Yes.

59:01.720 --> 59:05.720
Yep. So it expanded my, you know, I had my framing or whatever,

59:05.720 --> 59:07.720
but that I did reach another layer,

59:07.720 --> 59:11.720
both above and below my justificatory narrative of expansion

59:11.720 --> 59:16.720
and coherence integration and afforded a presencing of that.

59:16.720 --> 59:21.720
Being this and then basically it was, I am energy.

59:21.720 --> 59:23.720
I'm in this energy information blob.

59:23.720 --> 59:24.720
Okay.

59:24.720 --> 59:27.720
But it's actually the arrangement of my energy information blog

59:27.720 --> 59:30.720
then affords a profound experience of wisdom.

59:30.720 --> 59:32.720
And that's what I meant as wisdom energy.

59:32.720 --> 59:35.720
It's just sort of like, yeah, you know, this,

59:35.720 --> 59:38.720
and it feels the way, you know, it's just walking my dog.

59:38.720 --> 59:40.720
You know, it's just, you know,

59:40.720 --> 59:43.720
it's just the opportunity here for profound sustainability,

59:43.720 --> 59:45.720
meaning it's like, if actually,

59:45.720 --> 59:48.720
if I just relate to myself and the world they particular,

59:48.720 --> 59:50.720
I don't need to, of course I need to eat a few things,

59:50.720 --> 59:53.720
but I mean it's like the consumption and the doing and the,

59:53.720 --> 59:56.720
you know, all of a sudden it's just sort of like, God, you know,

59:56.720 --> 59:59.720
so I kind of know that we've really unwell balanced in this regard.

59:59.720 --> 01:00:02.720
It's like, what the hell is this? Why don't I just like, you know,

01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:04.720
I can just be in love, you know,

01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:06.720
basically it's just being in love with existence.

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:10.720
It's just being in love without memory or desire, you know,

01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:14.720
and that the ego facility sort of drops in out.

01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:17.720
And it is a profound sense of being held.

01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:20.720
I really do feel held by the universe.

01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:25.720
And at one with it in a particular way in that self other just grip of the world.

01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:29.720
And that it's a level of feeling that I think that's what I kind of,

01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:33.720
I think I'm like reflecting back with you about this.

01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:35.720
To the earlier part of our conversation.

01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:37.720
Is it.

01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:41.720
It's, it sounds like an embodied optimal grip.

01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:42.720
Yeah.

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:44.720
With, with being right.

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:45.720
Like,

01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:46.720
That's great.

01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:48.720
That's, you know, being John is cognitive science.

01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:51.720
This will tend to describe it that way. Yes.

01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:52.720
Yeah.

01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:53.720
In fact, in fact,

01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:55.720
to talk to with John the other day about this about,

01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:58.720
because he's been looking a lot more at attachment and he,

01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:04.720
the way he described attachment, right, was.

01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:08.720
As.

01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:12.720
The result and demonstration of, of optimal gripping.

01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:13.720
Right.

01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:16.720
Of the, this whole thing about that there's, and that's,

01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:20.720
it does make sense because it's.

01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:23.720
We're not looking at objects, right? There's, it's,

01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:26.720
it's dynamical relations all the way down. Right.

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:29.720
We're no something that's, it's, I think, in fact,

01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:33.720
I think the mistake is often we start to relate to ourselves as a thing.

01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:35.720
Right. That can have something. Right.

01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:38.720
But it's really a dynamical affordance of that.

01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:41.720
And would you say that, that, that, that you feel.

01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:45.720
That resonance that you're talking about that embodied resonance.

01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:49.720
It seems like your attachment systems. Right.

01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:53.720
Our system. It's what do you feel that through the same?

01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:55.720
I don't know if you want to call it circuitry.

01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:57.720
That one feels.

01:01:57.720 --> 01:01:59.720
Deeply valued.

01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:02.720
And a parent relationship. Is it a similar.

01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:03.720
Like.

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:04.720
Circus tree.

01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:05.720
Yep. Yeah.

01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:06.720
Well, I mean.

01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:07.720
Yeah.

01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:10.720
So certainly at the relational level. Yes. I mean,

01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:13.720
I was sort of expanding beyond in terms of the entire self.

01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:16.720
And it was, I will, as a social mammal, I'll feel it in relation.

01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:17.720
Okay.

01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:20.720
But so in terms of, so in terms of my attachments,

01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:22.720
just say, let's say with myself. Okay.

01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:23.720
Yeah.

01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:26.720
The attachment with yourself is the internalized.

01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:27.720
Intraject.

01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:29.720
The interject is the ego.

01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:31.720
Builds its model of the self.

01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:34.720
And then build a second order justification system of.

01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:35.720
Yeah.

01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:37.720
I me relation.

01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:40.720
And then starts to hold the standard of self.

01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:42.720
Relative reflecting on the self.

01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:45.720
The intuitive heart level and self esteem.

01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:48.720
And self acceptance refers to the way the interject.

01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:49.720
Treats the heart.

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:53.720
Okay. And that then often it's not always the parent,

01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:54.720
the way you do it,

01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:57.720
but to the internalized other and the normal standards are,

01:02:57.720 --> 01:03:00.720
you've internalized the standards of society, the super ego.

01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:01.720
So you know,

01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:04.720
know what contingent society is going to tell you that's loved

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:05.720
and acceptable.

01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:07.720
And then you judge yourself accordingly.

01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:10.720
So you jam the shit that's not acceptable into the closet and

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:12.720
other people can't see it. And then you won't,

01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:14.720
and you won't lose influence and value.

01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:18.720
But then of course you break the structure of coherent integration

01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:19.720
across the verticals.

01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:22.720
Cause you're now taking a poor aspect of the self that thinks it's

01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:24.720
an organismic value in processes like, Hey,

01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:26.720
this is how I want to express myself.

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:27.720
You're like, you know,

01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:31.720
like my friend who was gay in 1985 is like, you can't be fucking gay.

01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:32.720
You know,

01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:33.720
you know,

01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:36.720
all the homophobia is like jam that shit in the closet.

01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:37.720
And you're like, you know,

01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:39.720
and then you had to figure out how to come out of the closet.
