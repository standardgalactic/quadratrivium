1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
It's good to see you.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Can you hear me okay?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Yep.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
There was a little bit of interference there, but right now it's good.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So it's good to see you guy.

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It's been too long to connect.

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And I want to officially congratulate you on your new edition.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Thank you.

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Oh, that's gotta be a.

10
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Yeah.

11
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Yeah.

12
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Yeah.

13
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Yeah.

14
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Yeah.

15
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yeah.

16
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
That's right.

17
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Yes.

18
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
All right.

19
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Good to see you.

20
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Can you hear me? Okay.

21
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Yep.

22
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Thank you.

23
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
That's gotta be a pretty exciting thing to bring,

24
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
bring another life into the world.

25
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I know.

26
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Three times.

27
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Yeah.

28
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Beautiful.

29
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Beautiful.

30
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Right.

31
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Yeah.

32
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Three times totally.

33
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Yeah.

34
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
In fact, in fact, I, I'm not,

35
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm not in the place I'm normally at because.

36
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
My mother came to visit for the first time.

37
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So she's meeting T.

38
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And it's so.

39
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So, so guy, guy got kicked out.

40
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So he's, he's asking Mark.

41
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Well, that's what happens when new ones come along, you know,

42
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
the old ones get shuffled out.

43
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Absolutely.

44
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Right.

45
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We see the priority here.

46
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Amen.

47
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Yeah.

48
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So one of the things I wanted to talk with you about.

49
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Right.

50
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And I think a lot of this has to do with.

51
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
With the way that I,

52
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I see you really linking a lot of things together.

53
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Right.

54
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And, and, and I want to, I want to set some,

55
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I want to set some frames up here and then we can just see,

56
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
see how it leads all together. But, you know,

57
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
it's precisely,

58
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
precisely your work and the way you situate.

59
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
That sense of the primate, right.

60
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
That goes then into justification. Right.

61
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And that this,

62
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
my understanding is this primate level is the level of like attachment.

63
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Right.

64
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Right.

65
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's the level of attunement, attachment, all,

66
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
and there's of course stuff with Bowlby and couples therapy.

67
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I mean, there's the evidence for that is just Astramont.

68
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You know, it's so predictive how that goes.

69
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Right.

70
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's very powerful force.

71
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's surprising anyone ever missed that.

72
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
We somehow missed that.

73
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Right.

74
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm glad we'll be picking up and others. Yeah.

75
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Yeah.

76
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Absolutely.

77
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
And how that goes into justification. Right.

78
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And in the social arena,

79
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
where you become in your,

80
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
come the person, you know,

81
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
some sense you become initiated in a,

82
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
as a person in terms of socially justifying your own existence in

83
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
front of others. Right.

84
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Exactly.

85
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And also the way,

86
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
there's another way that you talk about it,

87
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
just to set this frame too, which I really,

88
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I appreciate is that of course,

89
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
then of course it's in that justification where things get

90
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
really fucked up. Right.

91
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And we end up totally split.

92
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So in order to justify my existence,

93
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I can't talk about this part of my existence and then I feel guilty.

94
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Then we have the splits.

95
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Then we see the psychologist and the psychologist is all about

96
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
helping unite these lower systems and these orders and sharing

97
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
the story. Right.

98
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And so I think that's one of the things that I think is really

99
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
important.

100
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
And I think that's one of the things that I think is really important

101
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
is that you can open around these,

102
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
these defensiveness,

103
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
this defensiveness and adaptations. Right.

104
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Absolutely.

105
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Yeah.

106
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And all of that coming together and how,

107
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
and in what way.

108
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
That in some sense is.

109
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Is connected ontologically to things. Right.

110
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Right.

111
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Absolutely.

112
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And, and so as we were talking about,

113
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm just going to summarize what we talked about before we hit record.

114
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Right.

115
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
One of the things for a while that I've been really thinking a lot

116
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
about is this notion of.

117
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
School lay.

118
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
The Greek sense of school lay,

119
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
which,

120
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
which usually translates into English is leisure.

121
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And of course,

122
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
leisure and idleness leisure is, is, is the core.

123
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's kind of, it's, it's so core to economics.

124
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Right.

125
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And metaphorically to everything that,

126
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
that if everything's going well, people work and then they have

127
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
leisure. Right.

128
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
They work too much and they don't have leisure. That's bad. Right.

129
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Yep.

130
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And however, it's very different.

131
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
That sense of leisure is not,

132
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
doesn't get at the deeper sense of the way that they talked about

133
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
school lay.

134
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Philosophically and religious.

135
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Right.

136
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yeah.

137
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
The Greeks.

138
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The Greeks saw school lay.

139
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
He uses this example.

140
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
For example,

141
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Aristotle said that all fear,

142
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
fear,

143
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
in geometry happens in school lay.

144
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And then in, in the apology, I think it was.

145
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Socrates said that I actually think you guys shouldn't kill me.

146
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I think, I think,

147
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I think Athens should pay me to be in school lay and.

148
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And have, and speak philosophy.

149
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Those conversations, right?

150
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Right. Right.

151
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And so you get this sense with school lay that like for the Greeks,

152
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
whereas in leisure, there's a sense in which there's time.

153
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And then you fill time.

154
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And then if, if you work, if you work hard enough and right enough,

155
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
and the economy works well,

156
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
then you can work for a certain amount of time.

157
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And then at the end you have free time or leisure.

158
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And you notice that conception of time is the same throughout.

159
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's just a matter of if it's filled with stuff or not filled with stuff.

160
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Yes.

161
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
But with something like, with something like theory or,

162
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
or philosophy or geometry, right?

163
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
At these higher levels of essentially contemplating being.

164
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
There's a very, very different sense of time, right?

165
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It's really precisely the pinnacle where, where,

166
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
where means and ends come together as one thing.

167
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Love it. Right.

168
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And so bringing this back into me having a kid, right?

169
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And, and everything that we're talking about was attachment, right?

170
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Right.

171
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Totally.

172
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Is for the Greeks.

173
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Skolle, the root of Skolle means holding to hold.

174
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Right.

175
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And that really only makes sense in relationship to time.

176
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So Skolle in the Greek sense was that time was something for

177
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
which was of our concern.

178
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It was an essential concern in the sense that there was a way that

179
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
if there's a way to hold time,

180
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
such that time in turn turns back and holds us.

181
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Love that.

182
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Right.

183
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
The Skolle was a way of being in time and holding time,

184
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
but then of revealing time, right?

185
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
In a way that they're mutually disclosive, right?

186
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And so that was the essence of time itself.

187
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So there's this really sense where meaning in time, right?

188
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Being in time would, would receive their pinnacle.

189
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And it wasn't like you were in Skolle and then not in Skolle.

190
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
No, it was more, it was more,

191
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
this was connected with the revelation of what time was, right?

192
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Which was the direct concern for us.

193
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
And so if you look at it now though, without that sense of time,

194
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
where time now is more this kind of anatomical force in which it,

195
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
of course we're subject to it and it concerns us,

196
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
but there's no sense in which time.

197
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It all responds to us, right?

198
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It's like we're subject to it.

199
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And therefore I think what,

200
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
what that's done on some level is we no longer see

201
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
meaning in time as unified, right?

202
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Or as a couple.

203
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
So therefore time is just this force, right?

204
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
That can't really hold meaning.

205
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It can just give lawful,

206
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
you can get a lot,

207
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
lawful like sustaining an entropy to circumstance.

208
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Therefore,

209
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
therefore we need to find meaning in the,

210
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
the sensations of our circumstances that you will, right?

211
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Thus the drama, but there's nothing about time that it all

212
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
responds to us, right?

213
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And that sense that the Greeks had about it.

214
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And so that in that,

215
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
and just this idea that in Schole,

216
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
that it's, it's this relationship to the ontology of time that,

217
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
that, that, that, that,

218
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
that the way I am comport is already a comporting or a holding

219
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
of time and that time is that which is holding me.

220
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Right.

221
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And now I think about that.

222
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Now I have a baby, right?

223
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
No, I'm thinking about all this.

224
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And now I have a baby, right?

225
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And yeah.

226
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And somebody asked me how Teague was.

227
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
And before I responded,

228
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I noticed that I had this picture of Teague, right?

229
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And that,

230
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
that I hadn't noticed that there is no Teague to simply Teague

231
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
being held, right?

232
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
At every picture, like either literally by our hands or held by

233
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
our attention or being held by the thing we set up for the crib.

234
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
In fact, if there's like a second where we don't have our eye on him,

235
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
it's like a big deal, right?

236
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Hey, hey.

237
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
And so, right?

238
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And so there's no such thing as Teague.

239
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
There's Teague continuous with being held.

240
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Right.

241
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And then if we think about that, right?

242
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
So there's something real.

243
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'm like, okay, what is this,

244
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
this connection between time, meaning ontology,

245
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
our vulnerability as human beings,

246
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
the fact that we primordially start like this,

247
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
like a deep vulnerability and an openness to the very holding,

248
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
right?

249
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Which then that holding in turn,

250
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
hopefully they internalize and as they internalize it,

251
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
as he grows up, we will then let go and he will take on the whole

252
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
holding.

253
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And so in some sense,

254
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm wondering about this idea of holding.

255
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
What does that reveal about the ontologically the case with us and

256
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
human beings, right?

257
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Totally.

258
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Totally.

259
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
All right.

260
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
So those are all the thought islands.

261
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Let's see if we can,

262
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
we see if we can peer underneath the surface,

263
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
pull some sort of synergy out of that.

264
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Yeah.

265
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Yeah.

266
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
That's a beautiful set of observations.

267
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Let me just say that. Okay.

268
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I love,

269
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I didn't know about the Greek word skole.

270
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Can you say that?

271
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Okay.

272
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
So we know about that word.

273
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
So let me give you just some thoughts to start to ground us in,

274
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
in relation to the holding environment that we can then cultivate.

275
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Yeah.

276
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Okay.

277
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Yeah.

278
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So the first thing, a couple of things that come to mind,

279
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
one is our vertical integration.

280
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Okay.

281
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Vertical integration of us as organisms first.

282
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Okay.

283
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Yeah.

284
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Into animals,

285
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
which then is the base of our feeling system.

286
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
And we can feel that, you know,

287
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
in our gut and our loins and in our gut.

288
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Okay.

289
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And that's the way the position of the body and whether we got pain

290
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
or emptiness in our stomach or horny and longs in the loins.

291
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It's an appetite of desires.

292
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It's a very platonic play-toe version.

293
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Yeah.

294
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
And that's our animal.

295
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You know,

296
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
our organism into animal level from a to K view.

297
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
So you're a bio physiological entity.

298
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
And then the first thing is, Hey,

299
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
you got to take care of survival.

300
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Shit.

301
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
You know, right?

302
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Yeah.

303
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And then we're social primates.

304
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Okay.

305
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
So then we move into the, what I metaphorically refer to the heart.

306
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Okay.

307
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And the heart's the relationship attachment system.

308
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Okay.

309
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
And there's nothing more central to an infant than this.

310
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I mean the whole,

311
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,000
because the entire safety food and relational matrix are all

312
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
intimately intertwined in virtually every infant's experience.

313
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Yeah.

314
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Yeah.

315
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And we see that in the holding that,

316
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
whether they're being prepared and connected,

317
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
they're so dependent.

318
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And for the first six months,

319
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
they are completely dependent upon the environment in which they're

320
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
held.

321
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Yeah. Right. Yeah.

322
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I know they're, they're, they're absorbing stuff.

323
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
They have enormous plasticity.

324
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
They're upgrading the various models,

325
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
but they're just checking shit out basically.

326
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Yeah.

327
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
They have a little bit of hand movement and a lot of,

328
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
they put shit in their mouth.

329
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Yes.

330
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
And they track everything really fast with the head.

331
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Yeah.

332
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And they have a visual auditory learning system,

333
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
but the body is doing, you know, it's barely roll over.

334
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Right. Right. Yes.

335
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Right.

336
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
So they're, so the system then in what they're doing from it,

337
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
that we can, we spoke about John Bulby. Okay.

338
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
So what he noticed is we,

339
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
the early systems of psychiatry psychology, well,

340
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
the key really is food.

341
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
So, you know, we had orphanage.

342
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
We just fed them as long as they stayed alive and the temperature

343
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
was thing and they didn't have any threat and they were getting

344
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
out of bed.

345
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
They should be all right.

346
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
And then all of these kids and orphanages that weren't being,

347
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
we're all broken in some ways, you know,

348
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
they were underdeveloped.

349
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
They felt the whole socio-emotional systems was out of touch.

350
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
They got these weird attachment structures that was a fundamental

351
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
set of insecurity.

352
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Okay.

353
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
That the,

354
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
that the environment would drop out of them at a particular level.

355
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Yeah.

356
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
They weren't known and valued and they wouldn't be protected.

357
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Yeah.

358
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And then they had to, they were, kids would respond in certain ways.

359
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
You'd either get very hyper dependent. Oh my God.

360
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Just try sending out alarms all the time, hyper neurotic,

361
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
sending out certain alarms to be so that they try to get what little

362
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
attention they could.

363
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Yeah.

364
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Or they would go avoidant, which is hyper independent.

365
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
They try to crush this need of the heart and then be,

366
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I don't need anybody. I'll just try to suppress it.

367
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Or they would get really, especially if they were abused,

368
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
then they get really erratic and disorganized attachments.

369
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Okay.

370
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Yeah.

371
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
And really this is what later attachment is about the circle.

372
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Of security that you're actually wanting to see build,

373
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
which is a fundamental participatory dance between the caregiver.

374
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And the infant.

375
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Where you're tracking eye movements and building a shared attention,

376
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
intention, space.

377
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Yeah.

378
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
So that you can then create the ground,

379
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
the socio-emotional ground that you will be cared for.

380
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
And if you have particular needs, you can signal them and I'll be able

381
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
to empathize with you and I'll meet them.

382
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Okay.

383
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Yeah.

384
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Yeah.

385
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
This creates the ground of the secure base.

386
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
From which the infant can go at six months into the next couple of

387
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
years and start to move away from the base.

388
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Okay.

389
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Yeah.

390
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
And then return to the holding environment.

391
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
If it falls, if the kid falls and scrapes his knee,

392
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
runs back to mom and dad and gets immediately returned to the holding

393
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
environment.

394
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Yeah.

395
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Yeah.

396
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Yeah.

397
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Yeah.

398
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Because the entire primate animal organism system is like check.

399
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Okay.

400
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Am I held safe?

401
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Or am I in the dark woods somewhere by myself?

402
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
The ultimate panic, right?

403
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Which is.

404
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Right.

405
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Complete.

406
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Yeah.

407
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Yeah.

408
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
You're about to get eaten by a dark man and a tiger in the woods.

409
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Absolutely.

410
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
So that's an unbelievable, that darkness is unbelievably,

411
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
you know, concerning the poor panic abandonment and the felt sense of

412
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
worthlessness and this felt sense of insecurity, you know,

413
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
and are you, and then you get polyvagal defensiveness throughout the

414
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
system when you're getting this structure.

415
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Yeah.

416
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Okay.

417
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
So you're being, you're either being held in the matrix of care or

418
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
not.

419
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Yeah.

420
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
And those are the two basic secure insecure.

421
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
And of course there's a lot in between.

422
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Yeah.

423
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Basically the matrix says there's actually these two equilibrium

424
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
states at a bimodal kind of distribution of being held.

425
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
And then you track the interpersonal world.

426
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
And indeed we know kids can be feel pretty safe with mom and not

427
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
with dad or vice versa, depending on the dance, the relation.

428
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It's called the circle of security and the more advanced

429
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
simulations that then afford.

430
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Right.

431
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
When it's there, it's a particular holding environment.

432
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
So, so the, the, when you have that,

433
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
you're going to create coherent integration in the environment,

434
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
into the body, into the animal, into the social primate.

435
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Okay.

436
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
And that's really the first couple of years is trying to create that

437
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
fundamental secure base.

438
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
So the system can then trust basic trust to use, you know,

439
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
the world and that you're going to get your needs met or basic

440
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
mistrust.

441
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
This is the Ericksonian formulation.

442
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Okay.

443
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
A basic trust is mistrust.

444
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Yeah.

445
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
That says, Hey,

446
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
yes, I will get my needs met because the environment will hold me in

447
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
a particular way.

448
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
And the environment holds me because it sees me as valuable.

449
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Yes.

450
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Exactly.

451
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
That connection between value and holding, right?

452
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
And what that means seems to be.

453
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Super.

454
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Deeply, deeply central. Yeah.

455
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
And I make a very important point about my own development in this

456
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
theoretical structure called the influence matrix,

457
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
which first emphasized it from an evolutionary instrumental way,

458
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
which is totally valid, but it's incomplete originally.

459
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
And that is what I call that the social influence line.

460
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Okay.

461
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
And social and it was to bind in sort of instrumental terms,

462
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
to what extent can you influence others in accordance with your

463
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
interests?

464
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Okay.

465
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
If I cry, will you come help me?

466
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Or will you ignore me?

467
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
So it's an instrumental framing,

468
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
which at a pragmatic level of survival is key.

469
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
However,

470
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
what I saw in the clinic room is that a lot of people could have

471
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
influence, but feel very empty inside.

472
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Okay.

473
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
And they would go around and they wouldn't,

474
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
or they would feel that they were not valued.

475
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
And I realized that actually the ultimate sort of core,

476
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
even from an evolutionary perspective,

477
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
the core equilibrium safe space is to be valued,

478
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
not just to be able to manipulate others instrumentally.

479
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Cause if the contingency of manipulation disappears,

480
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
then the,

481
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
then there's no intrinsic motive for mom and dad to love you.

482
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Then they're out of it.

483
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Okay.

484
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Yeah.

485
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
But if they're totally,

486
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
if their motivational system is attached to you by its own valuing

487
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
structure,

488
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
then that at a particular level, that's really key.

489
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
The other thing that's going to get back into why this is so

490
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
important is because modern science basically thinks and economics

491
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
thinks in terms of instrumental means and relationship and trying

492
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
to maximize productive control.

493
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Okay.

494
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
They then, in fact,

495
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
the entire social capital laborers basically,

496
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
influence and investment and return on investment in instrumentality,

497
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
modes of production and control.

498
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Okay.

499
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Yeah.

500
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
So the whole thing basically is like,

501
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
how do we efficiently maximize our influence and power over the

502
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
things for the least amount of money in relationship to particular

503
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
outcomes.

504
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
So now you create the doing instrumental mindset.

505
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
That then fundamentally merges as the dominant mode.

506
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
And this now brings in Eric from the dominant mode of doing that then

507
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
becomes so salient for the way in which we all think that's a

508
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
quantifiable and, you know,

509
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
many scientists see the behavioral and evolutionary sciences.

510
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Oh, we're all just selfish anyway.

511
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
And this is what we really care about and blah, blah, blah.

512
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Yeah.

513
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
And you know, what you can do is you, you know,

514
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
there is really any God, there's no real purpose,

515
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
but you can at least get the most toys that you have.

516
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
And get as much accomplishment.

517
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
And then that's, that's the doing of what, you know,

518
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
you get rich and you get status and you get leisure time.

519
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
And that's what you're trying to get.

520
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Yeah.

521
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
You know, do, do, do.

522
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Yes.

523
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Okay.

524
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Right.

525
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
So we'll love you, but at least we can hack it.

526
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Yeah.

527
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
At least we can hack it.

528
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
At least I can get the most.

529
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Yeah.

530
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
At least we can hack it.

531
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
At least I can get the most toys.

532
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
But like, at least we can hack that.

533
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
That's right.

534
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I got a big fucking Vita that's going to substitute, you know,

535
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
for true love,

536
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
but at least I got a big fucking Vita or have a nice Lamborghini

537
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
or something or not.

538
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
And then you're on the low shit.

539
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
And you can't do, and then you fail and all of that.

540
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Yeah.

541
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Yeah.

542
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
And then it's like, well, okay, well, what am I doing here?

543
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Well, I'm just trying to, I'm trying to,

544
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
everything's a means to an end relation.

545
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I mean, look at money.

546
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I mean, to the extent that then money becomes the symbol.

547
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
It's the ultimate instrumental symbol.

548
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Yeah. For some people, they get it so confused.

549
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I was like, I want to make more money.

550
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
You know, it's like,

551
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
as if that is some sort of quantifying in it.

552
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
That's empty calories at the core.

553
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Yeah.

554
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Yeah.

555
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Yeah.

556
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Yeah.

557
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
And I think that we're,

558
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,000
we have driven the doing mode to try to control energy and time

559
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
in an instrumental kind of way to enormous excess.

560
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Okay.

561
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Yeah.

562
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
And then that's not good calories for feeling,

563
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
spending time in an attached relational environment,

564
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
in nature,

565
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
feeling the oneness of the self-world modeling structure,

566
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
feeling held by that,

567
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
feeling fundamentally present and fulfilled in relationship to it,

568
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
feeling the integration between the body,

569
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
into the animal, into the heart,

570
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
into the justification, into the spirit,

571
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
mattering value purpose.

572
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
That's what I call vertical integration.

573
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Okay.

574
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
So if you get vertical integration,

575
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I would say then for me,

576
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
the label is wisdom energy.

577
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
And what you feel is just a massive presence,

578
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
a fundamental fit between the self-world environment

579
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
and a massive presencing of that.

580
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Yeah.

581
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And then that is a eudaimonic ultimate endpoint.

582
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
You are then in,

583
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
in sync,

584
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
incoherent integrative sync with the system.

585
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Yeah.

586
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
And then finally to bring it back to kind of the leisure,

587
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I feel like I got lucky with Socrates.

588
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I'm a public intellectual.

589
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I get paid.

590
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
And I tell people at the level of leisure,

591
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
it's like,

592
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
people are like, well, how often, how much do you work?

593
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I was like, well,

594
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I work either five or 75 hours a week,

595
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
depending on how you calculate it.

596
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Okay.

597
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Yeah.

598
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Yes.

599
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Because, you know,

600
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I have five hours of shit I need to do that is the kind of labor.

601
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
And, you know,

602
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
here's a paperwork thing, sign this prep.

603
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
This is like,

604
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
while I'm doing it,

605
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
the only thing I'm doing is for,

606
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
for instrumental purpose to get something done.

607
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
But I'm super lucky that I'm now at a place as full professor,

608
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
blah, blah, blah.

609
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
That's like a huge amount of work like this.

610
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Is this work?

611
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
You know, are we are, am I, I don't, I love this.

612
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I feel that enormously just present.

613
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I feel connected to you.

614
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I feel our souls connected in a particular way.

615
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
And then we engage in D a logos.

616
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
And then that's a,

617
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,000
then my experience of being in the world is just enriched by

618
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
these things.

619
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
So yeah.

620
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
No, it's like, you know,

621
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
it's productive and in growth promoting,

622
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
but it doesn't feel like I've had to,

623
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I'm trying to control something to get to some place.

624
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I'm in the place of being itself.

625
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Yeah.

626
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
And that's,

627
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
and there's somehow in some sense implicitly there.

628
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
And it's a couple of things that kind of link all of that together

629
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
all the way down to that.

630
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Like,

631
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
you know,

632
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I started with the first six months because the second six months,

633
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
right.

634
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:58,000
All the way is like mature professor. Right.

635
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
One is it sounds like your relationship with time is very,

636
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
very different, right.

637
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
In some sense that there is a way that you relate to time that seems

638
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
like these things,

639
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
these meetings or something like the pinnacle or express this

640
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
fundamental relationship where you're.

641
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,800
There is a sense in which it holds you and inspires you.

642
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,080
There's time disappears.

643
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,120
There's the flow state, Deologos, all of that.

644
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,400
Totally.

645
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,280
Now, it's interesting too that

646
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,880
this sense about when you talked about

647
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,880
after the first six months and then they start,

648
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,760
the child starts to venture away from the holding

649
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,080
and then they come back, right?

650
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,520
It's such a cool image of that,

651
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,600
because you can see that too, because they do.

652
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,240
They venture out, they're like,

653
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,640
they'll check back and then they'll go,

654
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,400
oh, they're gonna see what they gotta do.

655
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,760
And then they'll check back really quick,

656
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,920
are you still there, right?

657
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,000
Like, you're still there, I'll go out and then you look back,

658
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,840
right?

659
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:56,560
They're test, they intrinsically are testing something.

660
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,400
That's right.

661
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,960
And, and God, and there's so many different ways

662
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,720
that could get fucked up, right?

663
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,960
Like, cause I was thinking about that when,

664
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,320
if the, what happens when the child comes back

665
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,320
and then the mother's destroyed and angry

666
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,000
because the child left her, right?

667
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,440
Like, and then, and so there's all kinds of ways

668
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:18,680
that that dynamic relation can get all whacked out, right?

669
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,920
And then usually it stresses itself in all these,

670
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,960
you know, in broken marriages and-

671
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,000
Well, we're right, and then we test it all the time

672
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,840
for good reason.

673
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,560
You're like, hey, I'm gonna, I'll drop a cry over here

674
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,560
or I won't do other things.

675
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,520
And it was not with conscious justification,

676
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,360
but the design of the system is to know where it is.

677
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,200
So, and we do this with our spouses, you test them.

678
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,680
Yeah.

679
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,800
You drop little, I mean, not like very rarely,

680
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,720
I'm gonna adjust my, some people that,

681
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,400
but you do it intuitively

682
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,040
because you want to see where the value and attention is.

683
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:48,880
Okay?

684
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,920
Like, I mean, my kids, I mean, they've got five and three

685
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,520
and you know, you cut two pieces of cake,

686
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,640
hey, his cake's bigger than mine.

687
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:58,200
And I was like, and I was like, okay,

688
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,720
but you know, they're gonna check that

689
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,040
and they're gonna be like, hey, you cut it

690
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,200
and that reflects something in your heart, doesn't it?

691
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,920
You love him more than you love me.

692
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,600
Or you better draw attention to that.

693
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,160
You know, there's a little, you know,

694
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,840
that's a chronic state of,

695
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,400
is this environment really holding

696
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,480
and then I'll test it and see what happens.

697
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,320
You know, really.

698
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,040
Right, totally.

699
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:17,880
Like I,

700
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,680
well, the other thing about that that I didn't,

701
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:26,040
I think I saw as you're talking about this differently

702
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,520
than I saw it before,

703
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,440
which is this back and forth, right, relation,

704
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:36,640
that it's really, it's, it, how dynamic it is.

705
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,440
It's like, I know we talk about it in terms of like,

706
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,680
okay, is that, is the child starts to objectify, right?

707
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,320
Will that object hold me, right?

708
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,360
Is that all?

709
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,120
But really when we look at it this set,

710
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,720
they're not actually checking to a thing,

711
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,600
but that the stability is precisely a way

712
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,440
of a modal of relations happening, right?

713
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,880
So it's not like there's something stable

714
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,120
in a thing-like way.

715
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,200
It's a dynamic, a nexus of relations that are going on.

716
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,040
Totally.

717
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,480
Which they start to feel a certain kind of safety with.

718
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,920
And of course, the world is a chaotic network of relations,

719
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,080
right, that they're trying to tolerate

720
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,120
and then go back and forth.

721
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:16,960
Right.

722
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,400
And that, and that that's actually,

723
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,160
and that it's also,

724
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,960
it seems to me this relationship in some sense,

725
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,560
that seems that back and forth implies

726
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,720
a certain temporality, right?

727
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,560
Nope.

728
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,400
In some way.

729
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,240
Sure.

730
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,240
All right.

731
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,520
Is my past.

732
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,080
If I turn around and I look back,

733
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,400
will it still be there?

734
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,240
Right?

735
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,120
This future, right?

736
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,680
There's something drawing me in

737
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,840
that I don't know about yet.

738
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,960
Therefore it's chaotic,

739
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,800
but then I'll turn around this past

740
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,000
and this back and forth movement seems,

741
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:53,400
I would imagine that's probably one of the,

742
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,280
there's something there about temporality.

743
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,120
Right.

744
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:57,960
Well, the system starts to be able

745
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,600
to extend itself over time.

746
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,120
That's one of the first things, okay?

747
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,160
So then the way in which you,

748
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,600
I mean, at first it's pretty immediate.

749
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,880
And then the capacity to then,

750
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,120
and indeed it is the argument that John and I

751
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,280
and Chris were making in the elusive eye was,

752
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:15,120
it is this capacity to begin to extend the self over time

753
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,880
through multiplicity of possible simulations

754
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,080
where the environment then changes as you,

755
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,960
but then it is the extension of self in that time

756
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,320
that really starts to give this self agent environment

757
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,000
relation and then the self other relational matrix

758
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,440
that then creates the model of the self.

759
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,600
Okay, so that means that we start to carry

760
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,880
and then we extend.

761
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,640
So that issue of who am I across time,

762
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,800
basically becomes the modeling structures

763
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,640
that afford you the opportunity to get a grip,

764
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,720
on the world.

765
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,880
So how you build that is through the attachments

766
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,400
of first mom and dad need to be present

767
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,720
or there needs to be a security system present

768
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,160
at first six months.

769
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,440
Then all of a sudden that it begins to extend

770
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,880
into an autonomy versus shame and doubt.

771
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,680
That's the next lace title, which is autonomy is like,

772
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,920
hey, I can now actually start to exhibit.

773
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,000
I have the motor work and cognitive capacity

774
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
start to exhibit control over the world

775
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,600
and distance myself, okay?

776
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,760
But as soon as I get distance in any way out here

777
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,680
in the darkness and I'm still just learning shit,

778
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,400
it all of a sudden becomes a dark, scary world.

779
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,280
Now I have to quickly touch, is mom gonna be there?

780
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:26,880
You know, if I move away, you know, when I look back.

781
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,120
And so then you have to expand the temporality

782
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,640
of the field of consideration

783
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,320
because now the opportunity across time is increasing

784
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,320
and you have to start to really protect

785
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,120
what's going on in relationship to that.

786
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,160
Right.

787
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,360
I mean, so interesting just to kind of grok this sense of

788
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,960
if I turn around and if I look up and it gets scary

789
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,880
and I turn around, are they still there?

790
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,880
That there is so linked to value, right?

791
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,440
Am I valued enough such that people stay around, right?

792
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,720
It's so interesting to think about it like that, right?

793
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,680
Being valued is so primary.

794
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,520
Totally.

795
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,600
That's it.

796
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,080
The fund, that is the core of the heart soul

797
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,280
is to be known and valued by important others,

798
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,720
at least according to the unified theory.

799
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,480
It's the fundamental calories, okay?

800
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,080
Of that part of your psyche.

801
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,760
And it's absolutely as crucial as good calories

802
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,400
for the body, you know, it's a fundamental

803
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,480
in some ways even, you know, at the level.

804
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,400
So am I known and valued?

805
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,840
It's not just can I manipulate them

806
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:33,840
but fundamentally they care about me, you know,

807
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,720
and my essence, okay?

808
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,320
And in non-contingent ways, they care about me.

809
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,600
Yeah, yeah.

810
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,200
That's what people really track

811
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,080
and they desperately need.

812
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,320
And unfortunately, because of our humanness though,

813
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,240
we get to a stage where we can,

814
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:50,320
there's an access to the interior through justification,

815
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,680
which they need to start talking, okay?

816
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,680
And little kids don't have to deal with this as much

817
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,280
but as you start to get older,

818
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:59,600
you can then the cognitive capacities of justification

819
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,920
start to say, well, okay,

820
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,880
I know mom wants to hear shit from me

821
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,000
or dad wants to hear shit

822
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,640
or my friends want to hear shit

823
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,920
and they can ask me questions.

824
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:11,760
So then I find myself basically generating a persona,

825
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,840
public justification out here, okay?

826
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,880
And that creates then the opportunity

827
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,560
for imposter syndromes,

828
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,640
which then emerge in middle to older childhood,

829
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,480
where you actually start to then create a public face,

830
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,280
a persona, that's young call,

831
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:30,120
that the mask that you then wear in relation

832
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,520
and you realize you do that

833
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,240
for social influence purposes,

834
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,800
meaning because you wear the mask,

835
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,000
you avoid their judgment in a particular way

836
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,840
or you obtain their praise.

837
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,680
But at the same time,

838
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:43,840
it creates a fundamental social versus core self-split

839
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,080
because it's like this,

840
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,240
they love me now as a function of the contingencies

841
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,480
that I give them.

842
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,120
But if they really knew me, I'm terrified they wouldn't.

843
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,280
That way I see that all the time in a relationship

844
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:57,800
to once adolescents start to struggle with mental health

845
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:01,240
and it creates this very, very brutal dichotomy

846
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,840
and there's no holding environment there

847
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,480
that can be really generated,

848
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,080
that's fundamentally embodied

849
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,400
because you can't really,

850
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,600
you can't bring yourself to test if so you fake it,

851
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,200
but you then don't trust that you would actually be held.

852
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,120
I have many, many clients

853
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,480
who had to work through that process

854
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,600
to afford coherent integration along those lines.

855
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,360
In fact, you were just saying,

856
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,960
because I too, because I work with people one-on-one too

857
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,840
and in so many cases,

858
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,440
like I just started to,

859
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,480
it's at the point where I could just kind of almost

860
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,440
look for it, right?

861
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,040
There's something like life was fine, right?

862
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:43,000
Everything was fluid, I was loved and then we moved.

863
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,520
And then there was a new school

864
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,400
and then I had to like,

865
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,160
and then there's the socialization, right?

866
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,320
The break with something, some kind of security

867
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,120
and then there in a new social matrix

868
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,840
and then there's all these breakdowns

869
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,840
and on some level, right?

870
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,680
That's,

871
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,720
there, so much of their personality

872
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:05,400
has been defined in that adaptation, right?

873
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,560
Which has all these dichotomies in it, right?

874
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,600
And that's usually what we end up talking about, right?

875
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,280
Are issues around that fundamental break, yeah.

876
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,880
Totally, exactly.

877
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,280
And then that activates the insecurity

878
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,400
of not being held in the environment.

879
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,160
And then people struggle with various strategies,

880
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:26,360
testing, defenses, coping strategies, et cetera.

881
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:29,280
And if they are constrained and limited

882
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,960
and they also lead to additional problems,

883
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,280
you get an entrenched maladaptive problem

884
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,840
of a social phobia,

885
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,600
a fundamental sense of insecurity and inability

886
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,960
to articulate what's going on,

887
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,840
a hyper-reactivity of the vulnerability

888
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,640
because you're always on edge.

889
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,520
And then of course that makes you very difficult

890
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:49,760
to then engender the risks that are necessary

891
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,120
and they perceive them often as great risks

892
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,440
to then go out and try to find

893
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,240
a new secure identification matrix.

894
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:01,440
Identification matrix is the self-world identity process.

895
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,120
So these are the elements of the world.

896
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,160
It's my map of that, not necessarily conscious,

897
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,000
but just intuitively the way you map it.

898
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,120
My place in that world

899
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,280
and this is what's gonna happen to me

900
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:12,280
if I behave in X, Y, and Z ways.

901
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,160
Right, right, right.

902
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:21,280
You know, the sense about, right,

903
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:25,360
one of the things that's interesting to me about this

904
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:29,040
is this, you can see through all of this

905
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:32,480
that, you know, I often talk about it like this.

906
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,600
It's like, you know, do you,

907
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,200
I don't know about all of biology,

908
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,760
but like in terms of mammals,

909
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,920
I don't think there's anything more helpless

910
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,000
than the human infant, is there?

911
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,280
Not even close.

912
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,120
Not even close.

913
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,080
And what's interesting about this,

914
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,840
this has always struck me as like,

915
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,440
we all start off like that.

916
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:02,440
Like the way we start is completely dependent,

917
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:06,640
completely helpless in every dimension

918
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,800
that you can imagine.

919
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,640
Totally.

920
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:14,560
And who's going to Mars, right?

921
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,640
Who's on top of the food chain?

922
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,560
Who's, right?

923
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,680
Who's the one, as far as we can tell,

924
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,080
I mean, who knows ultimately,

925
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,200
but as far as we can tell,

926
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:28,560
who's the one that caught a sight of its own existence

927
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:32,360
and then can relate back with that existence, right?

928
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:35,160
Even that, you can feel a kind of vulnerability

929
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:39,040
or transparency or porousness going on.

930
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:39,920
And I think about this,

931
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,560
and this is where it starts to get kind of ontologically

932
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,720
where I want to bring this in.

933
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:46,040
And I'm just curious how this weaves together

934
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:50,800
is, so there's a deep vulnerability

935
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:55,800
that seems to afford the highest levels of theoria, right?

936
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:03,280
Of mystical realization, right?

937
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,480
Deep conceptualization, right?

938
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:13,240
These unitary things and abstractions

939
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,360
and all of that, right?

940
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:22,640
And in one sense, there's this helplessness

941
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,920
that also, right?

942
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,320
And in this relationship with that vulnerability,

943
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,800
in its hold-it, right?

944
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,720
Yes.

945
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:36,560
And it's all, so if you think about this statement,

946
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:41,560
I think it's Jesus, I think he says this in the Bible,

947
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,360
I'm so not up on that stuff,

948
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:48,160
but where he says, the meek shall inherit the earth.

949
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,720
You think about that statement, right?

950
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:53,520
Such a weird thing at face value,

951
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,680
the meek shall inherit the earth.

952
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:59,520
When you think about it like that, right?

953
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,160
Like in the terms we're talking about,

954
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,600
you can start to get where you're talking about.

955
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,200
Like that there is a way that,

956
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,240
and I think what he's basically saying is,

957
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:14,160
the meek, when loved, right?

958
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:19,160
That can potentuate this vulnerability

959
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,840
into something very, very powerful, right?

960
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,280
And so there's that part of it that's just,

961
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,600
it seems I'm wondering,

962
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,560
it's like there's something ontologically

963
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,680
about vulnerability and holding, right?

964
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,720
That is expressed here.

965
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:43,680
And then also, but it also strikes me that as human,

966
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:47,080
oops, sorry about that.

967
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:47,920
That's fine.

968
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,040
I've got to figure out a way so when it calls,

969
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,400
it doesn't blank out.

970
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,520
You know, it's like, yeah,

971
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:00,400
so that something about the essence of being human, right?

972
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,200
Is really, really tied with being vulnerable.

973
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,680
But like, I don't know anybody.

974
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,160
In fact, I've been teaching courses

975
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:11,400
for years and I've never had anyone sit,

976
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,160
not once have I ever had anybody say,

977
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,200
respond to me when I've said,

978
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,880
well, hey, maybe this is a good time to be vulnerable,

979
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,800
where they're like, oh, I'm so,

980
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,960
I was, someone had to say it, right?

981
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,120
Thank God.

982
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:27,760
No, it's always this sense of like, oh, like, all right,

983
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,800
right, that on one level,

984
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,720
our humanity seems to be very much

985
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,200
about this deep vulnerability, right?

986
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,880
But there's a level at which it can be,

987
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:43,200
we can also be exposed, right?

988
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,120
Which is I think what we're really afraid of

989
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,560
when we talk about being afraid of being vulnerable,

990
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,880
but we're really, really afraid of

991
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,520
is we collapse that with being,

992
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:55,160
with the involuntary sense of being subject

993
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,800
to something in which I'm exposed to,

994
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,560
which I think is really, really different.

995
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,560
Vulnerability seems to, at least in my mind,

996
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:06,560
has more of a sense of I'm voluntary, right?

997
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,680
There's some sense of I'm willing, right,

998
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,160
to be vulnerable, both will, positive sense,

999
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,760
and willing, right, and the generative sense.

1000
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:22,320
And, but when that holding environment, right, breaks down,

1001
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,160
and we develop defenses,

1002
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,880
and so I don't wanna be human,

1003
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,880
so what I do is I put a shell around myself.

1004
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,480
But here's the paradox, it's like the moment,

1005
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,320
the moment I put a shell around myself,

1006
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:42,880
and this is why our psychological defense

1007
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,680
is on one level work, but the cost to them are great.

1008
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,880
I think it has to do with this,

1009
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,760
is because the moment I put a shell around myself

1010
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,880
is the moment I become brittle, right?

1011
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:56,880
So, and it seems to me that this relationship to,

1012
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:02,200
because on some level, you could say the mystic

1013
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:07,000
realizing on the top of the mountain, realizing being, right?

1014
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,560
You could almost see that is in some sense

1015
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:14,440
a profound relationship with his own vulnerability,

1016
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,040
such that he's so vulnerable,

1017
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:19,240
that he's vulnerable to the deepest depths of himself,

1018
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,000
and transparent to it,

1019
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,120
such that he realizes the ultimate depth of oneness,

1020
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,080
and then paradoxically,

1021
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,880
in that full realization of vulnerability,

1022
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,520
he's invulnerable, right?

1023
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,840
Because he's everything, right?

1024
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,800
We think about that as a symbol.

1025
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,680
Yeah.

1026
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,480
And this kind of, this ontological sense,

1027
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,000
this verticality, right,

1028
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,280
that has to do with holding time vulnerability,

1029
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,720
bringing those things together.

1030
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,760
What stands out for you in that?

1031
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,920
Well, a couple of things.

1032
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:55,120
So, yes, I think you're, first off,

1033
00:39:55,120 --> 00:40:00,120
we should highlight the vulnerability aspect of our nature.

1034
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:03,400
That we're born into the world vulnerable.

1035
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,360
And then that affords us a wonderful set

1036
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:12,360
of both opportunities and serious risks at multiple levels.

1037
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,280
And then our potentialities are structured

1038
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:19,160
around trying to mitigate and navigate those risks.

1039
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,400
Okay.

1040
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,600
And potentially can be realized

1041
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,400
through a huge amount of affordance.

1042
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,720
Okay, so let's just talk this through.

1043
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,520
So, I think the bottom line,

1044
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,080
why are we so vulnerable from an evolutionary perspective?

1045
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,440
I think the fundamental answer

1046
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,600
is because we're incredibly plastic, okay?

1047
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,960
I was just listening to Heather hiring on Jim Rutt,

1048
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,320
and she was like, from hunter-gatherer perspective,

1049
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,480
we're sort of the niche generalizers,

1050
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,360
meaning that we can bounce from,

1051
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,840
one of the things about it is we can bounce

1052
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:47,080
from niche to niche, okay?

1053
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:51,480
And learn strategies in a wide variety of addition niches.

1054
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,360
I mean, that's what our cognitive language,

1055
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,040
collective intelligence capacities,

1056
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,840
our creative capacities afford us that.

1057
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,920
How the hell do you, though,

1058
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,080
get all the cognitive gadgets

1059
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,600
and the availability to do that?

1060
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:08,600
Well, super long time of development, you know?

1061
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,240
And the other thing that probably the mechanics

1062
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,280
of the size of the head,

1063
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,960
then that requires to hold the brain,

1064
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,720
and then the birthing process is like,

1065
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,960
well, you can't stay in there forever.

1066
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,880
We're already have serious problems at birth.

1067
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,080
It's a hell of a process, right?

1068
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,120
Yeah.

1069
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,880
So you got to get the thing out of there

1070
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:29,880
really before it's ready, basically.

1071
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,320
And now all of a sudden you have this really,

1072
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:36,040
neotony is the extended period of neonatal development.

1073
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:39,400
And Steven J. Gould points out that this is a really,

1074
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:42,280
almost certainly a central feature of our development.

1075
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,800
So nature basically says, all right,

1076
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,400
we're going to get systems

1077
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,960
that can have this unbelievable cognitive learning flexibility

1078
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,320
that they can learn repertoires

1079
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,560
and then repertoire off a top so that they,

1080
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,480
most animals just learn repertoires.

1081
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,520
We earn repertoires on top of our repertoires.

1082
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,920
They've put them all together in evolutionary new ways

1083
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,480
through our learning.

1084
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,600
And then now we justify on top of that.

1085
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,760
So we are really do,

1086
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,560
our behavioral flexibility is really in a class by its set,

1087
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,400
okay?

1088
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:13,040
To get there, the system has to have be able to download

1089
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,880
and manipulate all that.

1090
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,560
Plus, so then it comes out very, very vulnerable.

1091
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,520
So now let's think about what that means about our condition.

1092
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:25,840
If I am fed and held well, okay,

1093
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:29,080
I can then grow and network into a collective intelligence

1094
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,640
that is enormous amount of power

1095
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,360
and be a part of something belonging.

1096
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,560
Actually, my doctoral student is probably going to do

1097
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:40,560
a dissertation on suicide called the ontology of belonging

1098
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,600
and suicidal behavior in adolescence, okay?

1099
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:48,080
And basically it's the ecology and ontology of belonging

1100
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:52,200
in her estimation that affords coherent integration.

1101
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,440
And what gets deviated for so many people

1102
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,720
is the breakdown in that.

1103
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:58,400
And then an internalized critical looping

1104
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,760
that then alienates and leads to psychic

1105
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:04,400
and then a crash and burn and have alienation.

1106
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,120
And you can see then that you have this whole,

1107
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,480
all of this potential,

1108
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,520
first off, you might get neglected and abused.

1109
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,600
That's horrifying, right?

1110
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:15,240
Or you might get situated so that you're in a contingency

1111
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,000
where you have to fake it,

1112
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,560
but then you feel empty inside.

1113
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:22,840
That's another sort of developmental line,

1114
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,440
an aberrant or atypical

1115
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,480
or less than fulfilling developmental line.

1116
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,960
And then there's this enormous potential

1117
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:32,960
to grow in connection with each other in nature

1118
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,080
in a fulfilled way because of the enormous plasticity

1119
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:39,440
and learning potential of the structure of the system.

1120
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:43,960
So our developmental trajectories are enormously variable.

1121
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,880
And so the idea that we're sort of like trying to track,

1122
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,280
oh, guys, is this a bad sign?

1123
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,480
Is this a good sign?

1124
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,880
Where are we and have potentials that afford that?

1125
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,160
The other thing that I was thinking of

1126
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,000
when you were talking,

1127
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,120
I hooked up with a theorist a while ago

1128
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:05,320
who really centered on this core split of our potential.

1129
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:09,240
He actually called his framework called the one divide, okay?

1130
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:12,080
And he basically argued that birth and early events

1131
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:15,080
inevitably result in trauma, okay?

1132
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:18,480
And then you have the activation

1133
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,560
of the low relational value, low social influence,

1134
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:25,560
panic of abandonment, death, desertion, okay?

1135
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:28,120
And that core panic is something

1136
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:31,680
that you are really programmed to like void.

1137
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,640
I was like, oh my God, am I gonna be seen

1138
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:38,400
and devalued and dejected and removed, okay?

1139
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,600
So then what happens then is the self system

1140
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:44,160
begins to model what makes me vulnerable

1141
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,880
and then how do I create a defensive self-structure

1142
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:51,320
that's trying to compensate and avoid and control

1143
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:52,360
in an instrumental way,

1144
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:55,120
the avoidance and discovery of that abandonment.

1145
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,920
And he argues that many, many people,

1146
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:58,760
and I think this is true,

1147
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:03,440
many people then live their lives essentially on the cusp.

1148
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,480
This is really a felt sense of insecurity

1149
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:10,000
you're building a defended character armor structure,

1150
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,600
Wright talks about character armor

1151
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:12,920
from a psychodynamic perspective,

1152
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:15,240
you build this up and the function of that

1153
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:19,200
is to avoid the terror with the fear

1154
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,480
that if you fail to do this, you would be revealed

1155
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,320
and you'd be rejected

1156
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:25,680
and you have a fundamental abandonment, okay?

1157
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,720
The structure of that,

1158
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:30,120
if you think the vertical integration structure of that,

1159
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:33,040
it's basically, it's an empty dark core

1160
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,960
that is speaking to you constantly

1161
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,280
and the rest of your character structure

1162
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:42,280
then is a compensation to try to avoid falling into something.

1163
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:43,840
Yeah.

1164
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:44,680
Yeah.

1165
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:45,520
Think about that.

1166
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,840
Yeah, it's like, exactly.

1167
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:48,480
Like, ah, you know.

1168
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,080
And that is, and now I need to work really hard

1169
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:56,080
to build stuff and then the felt sense of existence is,

1170
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:57,560
how far can I stay away from it?

1171
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,120
But everything then you're doing

1172
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:01,120
is actually negatively reinforcing.

1173
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:02,760
And what that means is you do shit

1174
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,880
so that you avoid the potential horror of consequence.

1175
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:09,440
And it takes a little bit of the edge off periodically

1176
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,280
but then you have to keep doing stuff

1177
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,200
to keep the abyss falling away.

1178
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,840
I've met a lot of people that live their lives like that

1179
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,840
and it is, it's pretty tragic

1180
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:21,640
because the entire structure of being

1181
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:22,760
then is like, it's just,

1182
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:25,280
how do I avoid falling into abyss

1183
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:29,080
as opposed to how do I live in the divine bliss?

1184
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:29,920
Okay.

1185
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:30,760
Yeah.

1186
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:32,880
The fullness, not the negation.

1187
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:33,720
Exactly.

1188
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,760
It's like, oh my God.

1189
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,240
You mean to say that I can be valued

1190
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,400
and value that into my animal body,

1191
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:45,120
into my soul and my cells and feel at oneness

1192
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:48,720
with the sense of divine, with the ultimate purpose,

1193
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:53,080
with the negentropic complex, coordinated,

1194
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,160
integrated processes.

1195
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,920
That's my spirit into my system of justification.

1196
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:57,920
Then you drop into that

1197
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,440
and you just feel a perspectival,

1198
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:04,240
a heart flood with a sense of appreciation, gratitude, love,

1199
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,800
awe, all of that, and then down into the body.

1200
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,640
And that is, then that's the true self,

1201
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:11,760
what he calls the true self integration.

1202
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,760
And it creates the basically the stack

1203
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,240
of an affirming belief system in spirit

1204
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:18,800
that has some sense making,

1205
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,920
that makes sense of the heart that's known and valued,

1206
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:23,560
that's into the body that's felt held and secure

1207
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:25,160
in the environment itself.

1208
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:26,960
And then I think one of the things

1209
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,040
that we should be really emphasizing,

1210
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,800
my friend Rob Scott emphasized this,

1211
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,440
calls it the fundamental shift is those moments

1212
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:39,440
of being itself are the awe-inspiring glory

1213
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:45,800
of being itself and to be just in the moment of awareness,

1214
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,640
of fundamental awareness

1215
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:50,560
and to cultivate the taste of that beauty,

1216
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:53,120
of awareness itself.

1217
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,800
I mean, I find that to be,

1218
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,800
and then you get back to the whole leisure place,

1219
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:00,920
is sort of like to have the opportunity to simply be,

1220
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:01,760
right?

1221
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:06,760
And then to be and to have that beingness

1222
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:11,160
be so fill your existence in the world.

1223
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:12,320
I mean, that's a beautiful thing.

1224
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,880
I mean, that's a beautiful thing.

1225
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:16,600
And I think there's an opportunity for us to achieve that.

1226
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:17,640
He certainly makes this case.

1227
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:19,400
I believe this too, that we just,

1228
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:22,560
we don't so, we socialize towards instrumental control

1229
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,160
and doing, you know?

1230
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,720
And can I do more and do more and do more and get more

1231
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,840
and the whole, and then you can rest

1232
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:33,040
and or watch your damn, you know, whatever is fun for you.

1233
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:36,200
And it's like, you're missing the entire point

1234
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:38,160
of being in becoming modes of, you know,

1235
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,800
we should be working when certainly you have to

1236
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,840
at some level, it's not like you don't do,

1237
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:46,800
but the cultivation of that fundamental being in the world

1238
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,320
and being held by the world in a moment of the infinite now

1239
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,160
and a particular kind of presence

1240
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,320
to be able to taste that, to be present with that.

1241
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,640
I think that's a, I've certainly grown

1242
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,760
in the last five years in that mode.

1243
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:00,840
And, you know, even as a clinical psychologist,

1244
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:03,720
we aren't socialized too much to orient to that.

1245
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,320
I think that's a great,

1246
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:07,440
many wisdom traditions do orient that way.

1247
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,000
And I've really felt fortunate

1248
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,440
that I've been hanging out with people over the last five years

1249
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:15,080
and really shine the light on that in a rich way.

1250
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:15,920
Right.

1251
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,120
Well, one of the things that is you've been describing

1252
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:20,640
all of this, it's just been,

1253
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:24,880
it's a marvel to realize our pre-reflective

1254
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:29,880
organismic sense knows this relationship with folding.

1255
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:34,320
It's embodied, embedded, right?

1256
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:38,920
There's a deep, seems super intelligent to me.

1257
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:43,320
It's network of is intelligibility

1258
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:48,240
that seems to somehow be oriented to this, right?

1259
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,040
So just this idea of that,

1260
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:52,000
because I've seen this over and over and over again,

1261
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,360
where, you know, like it is, it's really true.

1262
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:58,600
It's like, I think it's set up in such a way

1263
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,600
and it says a lot to do with nihilism.

1264
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,400
It says a lot to do with the meeting crisis,

1265
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,240
all of this, right?

1266
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:04,800
Where we're not really,

1267
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:09,080
we don't even consider that we don't have

1268
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:12,800
an understanding of being that isn't contingent, right?

1269
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,000
There's not this sense of contingency,

1270
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,480
the sense of, that there is, there are principles, right?

1271
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:23,200
That in some sense govern,

1272
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,200
you know, govern the orderliness

1273
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:29,640
or make it possible for orderliness.

1274
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:32,320
And in some sense, philosophy, right?

1275
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,480
Philosophy in the deepest sense of the word

1276
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,560
was really in some sense about getting close to

1277
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:40,040
and beholding those principles, right?

1278
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:45,160
That in some sense, the principle itself,

1279
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:47,120
you can't, what's interesting about is,

1280
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:49,160
the principle itself is like, you cannot,

1281
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,160
it's one of those things where you cannot ultimately,

1282
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:57,280
you can't put into language, right?

1283
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,160
I think, yes, it's the way, you know,

1284
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:01,560
you go to Taoism catchers, this is pretty early.

1285
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:03,440
I think when they say the Tao is not the Tao,

1286
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:07,120
it's a participatory, perspectival presencing

1287
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:10,840
that is definitely at this animal heart,

1288
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:13,000
you know, felt sense of being it.

1289
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,720
And then, and also I think it often is,

1290
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:17,240
when we have our transcendent states,

1291
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,640
it's trans-justificatory.

1292
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,800
So in virtually all mystic states, it's, you know,

1293
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,440
the ego dies or dissipates that little,

1294
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:26,240
the narrating regulator or seeking justification,

1295
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,560
control and legitimacy, right?

1296
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,120
That is crucial.

1297
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:33,240
But it is a particular kind of mode

1298
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:35,320
that I think our modern style is like,

1299
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:38,240
way over-activated in a particular way.

1300
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,480
Oh, totally.

1301
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:41,960
And then it kind of controls the shit

1302
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:44,120
and is trying to regulate and make sure everything

1303
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:46,200
fits in the damn boxes that it's trying to control.

1304
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:48,800
Anxious or pissed off if it doesn't, you know,

1305
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,080
win its justification in a particular way.

1306
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:53,440
And that is, that's definitely not

1307
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:57,320
the coherent stacked integration.

1308
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,240
In fact, that's just one piece of it

1309
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:01,720
and you need to be underneath it and above it

1310
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:06,400
rather than just trying to use it as the primary,

1311
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,680
you know, propositional reasoning network,

1312
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:10,920
which is really modernity, you know,

1313
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:13,560
basically started to just said that in many ways.

1314
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:15,280
It was like, wow, we're gonna reason our way

1315
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,400
through justification and science into this.

1316
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,920
I know Ian McGillchrist makes a number of points

1317
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,600
in these directions and I agree.

1318
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,480
Yeah, right.

1319
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:25,960
And this sense of witnessing,

1320
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:27,240
and I'm sure you've probably experienced

1321
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:31,480
this being a therapist too of that.

1322
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:32,560
It sounds like I would imagine

1323
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:33,800
that therapy is a lot like this,

1324
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:37,120
but just when you start to get real about,

1325
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:39,560
people start to have these insights that,

1326
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:44,080
and it's usually when their defensive strategies

1327
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:49,680
don't like actually start the balance,

1328
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,280
the benefit of that goes down, right?

1329
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:53,800
Right.

1330
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:54,960
Because usually I've noticed this

1331
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,640
with like kind of psychological forms of defensiveness,

1332
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:00,800
is it creates this immediate sense of safety,

1333
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:03,440
but in a way that numbs you

1334
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,280
or has you not see the long-term consequences.

1335
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:08,520
And I think that thing that you were talking about,

1336
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:11,240
this nemo, this emptiness inside,

1337
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:15,080
in which if you fall into that, it's all over, right?

1338
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:16,720
That's the felt sense.

1339
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:21,280
Then you live such that you're not that,

1340
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,400
and then you articulate a whole way of being

1341
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,480
that's about an avoidance of that, right?

1342
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:30,800
But then you're dependent on that in some weird sense.

1343
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:34,680
So you go in with people and you start talking about this,

1344
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:38,320
and you say, well, what would happen if you just didn't do that?

1345
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:39,320
Yeah, totally.

1346
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,960
Like in this anxiety comes up,

1347
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:44,680
and then there's a way where it's like you take something

1348
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:47,600
to be with the anxiety and the annihilation

1349
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:51,480
because there's a deep mistake going on in there, right?

1350
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:52,800
Right, exactly.

1351
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,600
But when people can tolerate it, right,

1352
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:56,840
and the conditions are right,

1353
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:59,440
and they can tolerate it and they can open to it,

1354
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:03,480
that and go through that initial, it's like feeling,

1355
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:07,800
it's like that level of experience is so, it's so intense, right?

1356
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:12,280
It's like, imagine, it's like the feeling,

1357
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:15,320
it's like the most haunting, nauseating,

1358
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:19,840
like everything unattractive that you could imagine

1359
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:22,080
in your very pores is the recognition

1360
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:24,400
that that's all that there is, that's what it feels like, right?

1361
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,560
It's like total awfulness, right?

1362
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:29,160
In the deep sense of the word,

1363
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:32,360
and it takes something to even get any leverage

1364
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:34,440
to be able to turn towards it, right?

1365
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:37,320
Absolutely, it takes a little bit.

1366
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:40,200
But when you do, there is something though,

1367
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:42,920
because, and I'm kind of getting this through this conversation

1368
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:45,320
in a different way,

1369
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:49,600
that I don't know if I quite saw it like so congruently here,

1370
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:54,600
is that we have our nervous system

1371
00:54:55,960 --> 00:55:00,960
is really knows how to open to that deep openness, right?

1372
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:05,640
It's like something catches,

1373
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:08,440
like if you can feel through that barrier, right?

1374
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:11,280
And you can like, at some point, you're like,

1375
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,880
all right, non-being, ah!

1376
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:16,720
Right?

1377
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:17,880
Totally, yeah.

1378
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:19,160
At some point, you're like,

1379
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:23,160
well, there is a lot of room.

1380
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:24,360
It is kind of spacious in there.

1381
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:27,120
In fact, there's like an affording spaciousness in like,

1382
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:30,240
but your nervous system knows how to,

1383
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:35,720
how to take in that in the most generative sense, right?

1384
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:36,720
Yes.

1385
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:37,720
Yeah.

1386
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:38,720
If it's, yeah.

1387
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:40,720
Right, it has that potential, okay?

1388
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:41,720
Yeah.

1389
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:43,720
It also, the reason people get all tangled up

1390
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:47,240
is precisely because the way that egoic narrator

1391
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:48,720
frames it all, okay?

1392
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:49,720
Yeah.

1393
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:50,720
If you frame it in a particular way,

1394
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:53,240
and you do have a core anxiety thing,

1395
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:55,240
and then you get a lot of reinforcement,

1396
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:56,720
that this in structure,

1397
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,720
because the system basically is reading this,

1398
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:02,720
is that this is annihilation itself, okay?

1399
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:03,720
Yeah.

1400
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:05,720
And then you build all the justification around that.

1401
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:09,720
And then what you, if you do it in the right way,

1402
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:12,720
and afford the person to bring to bear

1403
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,720
what that annihilation actually means,

1404
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,720
at first it's terrifying, right?

1405
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:17,720
Yeah.

1406
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:18,720
But you're right.

1407
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,720
If the opening of what this might mean

1408
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,720
and what might be on the other side of it

1409
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:24,720
is afforded to the individual,

1410
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:27,720
and they can hold the egoic defenses off

1411
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:30,720
or participate in a flow that don't lead

1412
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:31,720
to the reciprocal narrowing

1413
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:33,720
and the need to escape in safety,

1414
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:36,720
but actually get present and take the step off

1415
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:39,720
into sort of like what appears to be the abyss.

1416
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:40,720
And then it's like, oh!

1417
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,720
And then you're like, huh.

1418
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:43,720
You know?

1419
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:48,720
Here I am not meeting up my dad's standards,

1420
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:50,720
and here I am not being this,

1421
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:52,720
and here I am being the person that's rejected,

1422
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,720
and here I am, and here I still am.

1423
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:58,720
And here I am like so many other people,

1424
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:01,720
and then here I am like living my life,

1425
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:04,720
and then it's just like, and then here I am living.

1426
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,720
And then it's like, well, isn't this fascinating

1427
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:09,720
that this is all part of the drama, you know?

1428
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:11,720
And then all of a sudden the relationship to this

1429
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:14,720
is instead of the doer, controller, manipulator,

1430
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:17,720
avoider, defender, it's just the beer, you know?

1431
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:19,720
It's just sort of like, huh.

1432
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:22,720
And of course that is the, that shift when I see it.

1433
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:26,720
And you're like, you start noticing like, what is this am?

1434
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:27,720
Yeah.

1435
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:28,720
The am doesn't seem to,

1436
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,720
if you follow me around everywhere,

1437
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:31,720
what is this am, right?

1438
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:32,720
There you go.

1439
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,720
Oh, close one day.

1440
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,720
There's the beginning of all of it.

1441
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:37,720
Yeah, of the whole new vibe.

1442
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:40,720
Yeah, you start to make that fundamental shift.

1443
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:41,720
And then I think that, you know,

1444
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:46,720
to coach people into the mode of fulfillment,

1445
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,720
you know, what is fundamental fulfillment?

1446
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,720
And certainly from my vantage point, you know,

1447
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:55,720
it is in the now of, of, of existence in that felt sense

1448
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:59,720
of beingness, being and becoming, the doing is crucial,

1449
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:01,720
but it's, that's means to end shit.

1450
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:05,720
This fundamentally is the eudaimonic point, you know,

1451
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:09,720
that affords the particular capacity,

1452
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:11,720
whether it's by some design, design,

1453
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:14,720
or at least just a hell of a fortunate system

1454
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:17,720
towards neg entropy that affords us what it is like to be

1455
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:20,720
cohering and integrating across multiple levels.

1456
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:23,720
And then to have the reflective felt sense of appreciation for

1457
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:26,720
that, which to me took a little cultivation,

1458
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:28,720
but is now super available.

1459
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:29,720
Yeah.

1460
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:32,720
And that's, that's a nice place.

1461
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:34,720
I remember when you talked about, when you,

1462
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,720
when you talked about that of,

1463
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:40,720
I think part of what you mean with that is when you talk about

1464
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:41,720
when wisdom energy,

1465
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:44,720
would you say wisdom energy and in the way you're talking about it,

1466
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:47,720
is in the way you're talking about it, is that, is that.

1467
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:50,720
That felt experience.

1468
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:53,720
Of all of that intelligibility coming through a, like,

1469
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:57,720
you could feel it in your body from the inside out, right?

1470
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:58,720
Exactly.

1471
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:00,720
In a way that you.

1472
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:01,720
Yes.

1473
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:05,720
Yep. So it expanded my, you know, I had my framing or whatever,

1474
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:07,720
but that I did reach another layer,

1475
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:11,720
both above and below my justificatory narrative of expansion

1476
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:16,720
and coherence integration and afforded a presencing of that.

1477
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:21,720
Being this and then basically it was, I am energy.

1478
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:23,720
I'm in this energy information blob.

1479
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:24,720
Okay.

1480
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:27,720
But it's actually the arrangement of my energy information blog

1481
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:30,720
then affords a profound experience of wisdom.

1482
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:32,720
And that's what I meant as wisdom energy.

1483
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:35,720
It's just sort of like, yeah, you know, this,

1484
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:38,720
and it feels the way, you know, it's just walking my dog.

1485
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:40,720
You know, it's just, you know,

1486
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:43,720
it's just the opportunity here for profound sustainability,

1487
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:45,720
meaning it's like, if actually,

1488
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:48,720
if I just relate to myself and the world they particular,

1489
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:50,720
I don't need to, of course I need to eat a few things,

1490
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:53,720
but I mean it's like the consumption and the doing and the,

1491
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:56,720
you know, all of a sudden it's just sort of like, God, you know,

1492
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:59,720
so I kind of know that we've really unwell balanced in this regard.

1493
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:02,720
It's like, what the hell is this? Why don't I just like, you know,

1494
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:04,720
I can just be in love, you know,

1495
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,720
basically it's just being in love with existence.

1496
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:10,720
It's just being in love without memory or desire, you know,

1497
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:14,720
and that the ego facility sort of drops in out.

1498
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:17,720
And it is a profound sense of being held.

1499
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:20,720
I really do feel held by the universe.

1500
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:25,720
And at one with it in a particular way in that self other just grip of the world.

1501
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:29,720
And that it's a level of feeling that I think that's what I kind of,

1502
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:33,720
I think I'm like reflecting back with you about this.

1503
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:35,720
To the earlier part of our conversation.

1504
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:37,720
Is it.

1505
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:41,720
It's, it sounds like an embodied optimal grip.

1506
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:42,720
Yeah.

1507
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,720
With, with being right.

1508
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:45,720
Like,

1509
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:46,720
That's great.

1510
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:48,720
That's, you know, being John is cognitive science.

1511
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:51,720
This will tend to describe it that way. Yes.

1512
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:52,720
Yeah.

1513
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:53,720
In fact, in fact,

1514
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:55,720
to talk to with John the other day about this about,

1515
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:58,720
because he's been looking a lot more at attachment and he,

1516
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:04,720
the way he described attachment, right, was.

1517
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:08,720
As.

1518
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:12,720
The result and demonstration of, of optimal gripping.

1519
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:13,720
Right.

1520
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:16,720
Of the, this whole thing about that there's, and that's,

1521
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:20,720
it does make sense because it's.

1522
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:23,720
We're not looking at objects, right? There's, it's,

1523
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:26,720
it's dynamical relations all the way down. Right.

1524
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:29,720
We're no something that's, it's, I think, in fact,

1525
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:33,720
I think the mistake is often we start to relate to ourselves as a thing.

1526
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:35,720
Right. That can have something. Right.

1527
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:38,720
But it's really a dynamical affordance of that.

1528
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:41,720
And would you say that, that, that, that you feel.

1529
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:45,720
That resonance that you're talking about that embodied resonance.

1530
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:49,720
It seems like your attachment systems. Right.

1531
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:53,720
Our system. It's what do you feel that through the same?

1532
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:55,720
I don't know if you want to call it circuitry.

1533
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:57,720
That one feels.

1534
01:01:57,720 --> 01:01:59,720
Deeply valued.

1535
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:02,720
And a parent relationship. Is it a similar.

1536
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:03,720
Like.

1537
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:04,720
Circus tree.

1538
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:05,720
Yep. Yeah.

1539
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:06,720
Well, I mean.

1540
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:07,720
Yeah.

1541
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:10,720
So certainly at the relational level. Yes. I mean,

1542
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:13,720
I was sort of expanding beyond in terms of the entire self.

1543
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:16,720
And it was, I will, as a social mammal, I'll feel it in relation.

1544
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:17,720
Okay.

1545
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:20,720
But so in terms of, so in terms of my attachments,

1546
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:22,720
just say, let's say with myself. Okay.

1547
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:23,720
Yeah.

1548
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:26,720
The attachment with yourself is the internalized.

1549
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:27,720
Intraject.

1550
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:29,720
The interject is the ego.

1551
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:31,720
Builds its model of the self.

1552
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:34,720
And then build a second order justification system of.

1553
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:35,720
Yeah.

1554
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:37,720
I me relation.

1555
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:40,720
And then starts to hold the standard of self.

1556
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,720
Relative reflecting on the self.

1557
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:45,720
The intuitive heart level and self esteem.

1558
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:48,720
And self acceptance refers to the way the interject.

1559
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:49,720
Treats the heart.

1560
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:53,720
Okay. And that then often it's not always the parent,

1561
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:54,720
the way you do it,

1562
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:57,720
but to the internalized other and the normal standards are,

1563
01:02:57,720 --> 01:03:00,720
you've internalized the standards of society, the super ego.

1564
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:01,720
So you know,

1565
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:04,720
know what contingent society is going to tell you that's loved

1566
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:05,720
and acceptable.

1567
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:07,720
And then you judge yourself accordingly.

1568
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:10,720
So you jam the shit that's not acceptable into the closet and

1569
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:12,720
other people can't see it. And then you won't,

1570
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:14,720
and you won't lose influence and value.

1571
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:18,720
But then of course you break the structure of coherent integration

1572
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:19,720
across the verticals.

1573
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:22,720
Cause you're now taking a poor aspect of the self that thinks it's

1574
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:24,720
an organismic value in processes like, Hey,

1575
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:26,720
this is how I want to express myself.

1576
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:27,720
You're like, you know,

1577
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:31,720
like my friend who was gay in 1985 is like, you can't be fucking gay.

1578
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:32,720
You know,

1579
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:33,720
you know,

1580
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:36,720
all the homophobia is like jam that shit in the closet.

1581
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:37,720
And you're like, you know,

1582
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:39,720
and then you had to figure out how to come out of the closet.
