0	2000	It's good to see you.
2000	4000	Can you hear me okay?
4000	5000	Yep.
5000	7000	There was a little bit of interference there, but right now it's good.
7000	9000	So it's good to see you guy.
9000	11000	It's been too long to connect.
11000	14000	And I want to officially congratulate you on your new edition.
14000	15000	Thank you.
15000	16000	Oh, that's gotta be a.
16000	17000	Yeah.
17000	18000	Yeah.
18000	19000	Yeah.
19000	20000	Yeah.
20000	21000	Yeah.
21000	22000	Yeah.
22000	23000	That's right.
23000	24000	Yes.
24000	25000	All right.
25000	26000	Good to see you.
26000	27000	Can you hear me? Okay.
27000	28000	Yep.
28000	29000	Thank you.
29000	32000	That's gotta be a pretty exciting thing to bring,
32000	34000	bring another life into the world.
34000	35000	I know.
35000	36000	Three times.
36000	37000	Yeah.
37000	38000	Beautiful.
38000	39000	Beautiful.
39000	40000	Right.
40000	41000	Yeah.
41000	42000	Three times totally.
42000	43000	Yeah.
43000	44000	In fact, in fact, I, I'm not,
44000	47000	I'm not in the place I'm normally at because.
47000	49000	My mother came to visit for the first time.
49000	50000	So she's meeting T.
50000	52000	And it's so.
52000	54000	So, so guy, guy got kicked out.
54000	56000	So he's, he's asking Mark.
56000	59000	Well, that's what happens when new ones come along, you know,
59000	61000	the old ones get shuffled out.
61000	62000	Absolutely.
62000	63000	Right.
63000	65000	We see the priority here.
65000	66000	Amen.
66000	67000	Yeah.
67000	70000	So one of the things I wanted to talk with you about.
70000	71000	Right.
71000	74000	And I think a lot of this has to do with.
74000	76000	With the way that I,
76000	79000	I see you really linking a lot of things together.
79000	80000	Right.
80000	83000	And, and, and I want to, I want to set some,
83000	86000	I want to set some frames up here and then we can just see,
86000	88000	see how it leads all together. But, you know,
88000	89000	it's precisely,
89000	94000	precisely your work and the way you situate.
94000	97000	That sense of the primate, right.
97000	101000	That goes then into justification. Right.
101000	102000	And that this,
102000	106000	my understanding is this primate level is the level of like attachment.
106000	107000	Right.
107000	108000	Right.
108000	112000	It's the level of attunement, attachment, all,
112000	116000	and there's of course stuff with Bowlby and couples therapy.
116000	120000	I mean, there's the evidence for that is just Astramont.
120000	122000	You know, it's so predictive how that goes.
122000	123000	Right.
123000	124000	It's very powerful force.
124000	127000	It's surprising anyone ever missed that.
127000	129000	We somehow missed that.
129000	130000	Right.
130000	132000	I'm glad we'll be picking up and others. Yeah.
132000	133000	Yeah.
133000	136000	Absolutely.
136000	139000	And how that goes into justification. Right.
139000	141000	And in the social arena,
141000	143000	where you become in your,
143000	145000	come the person, you know,
145000	147000	some sense you become initiated in a,
147000	152000	as a person in terms of socially justifying your own existence in
152000	154000	front of others. Right.
154000	156000	Exactly.
156000	157000	And also the way,
157000	159000	there's another way that you talk about it,
159000	162000	just to set this frame too, which I really,
162000	165000	I appreciate is that of course,
165000	169000	then of course it's in that justification where things get
169000	171000	really fucked up. Right.
171000	174000	And we end up totally split.
174000	176000	So in order to justify my existence,
176000	179000	I can't talk about this part of my existence and then I feel guilty.
179000	181000	Then we have the splits.
181000	185000	Then we see the psychologist and the psychologist is all about
185000	190000	helping unite these lower systems and these orders and sharing
190000	192000	the story. Right.
192000	195000	And so I think that's one of the things that I think is really
195000	196000	important.
196000	199000	And I think that's one of the things that I think is really important
199000	200000	is that you can open around these,
200000	201000	these defensiveness,
201000	203000	this defensiveness and adaptations. Right.
203000	204000	Absolutely.
204000	205000	Yeah.
205000	207000	And all of that coming together and how,
207000	208000	and in what way.
208000	211000	That in some sense is.
211000	213000	Is connected ontologically to things. Right.
213000	214000	Right.
214000	215000	Absolutely.
215000	216000	And, and so as we were talking about,
216000	219000	I'm just going to summarize what we talked about before we hit record.
219000	220000	Right.
221000	224000	One of the things for a while that I've been really thinking a lot
224000	226000	about is this notion of.
226000	227000	School lay.
227000	229000	The Greek sense of school lay,
229000	230000	which,
230000	235000	which usually translates into English is leisure.
235000	237000	And of course,
237000	240000	leisure and idleness leisure is, is, is the core.
240000	243000	It's kind of, it's, it's so core to economics.
243000	244000	Right.
244000	246000	And metaphorically to everything that,
246000	250000	that if everything's going well, people work and then they have
250000	251000	leisure. Right.
251000	254000	They work too much and they don't have leisure. That's bad. Right.
254000	255000	Yep.
255000	258000	And however, it's very different.
258000	260000	That sense of leisure is not,
260000	264000	doesn't get at the deeper sense of the way that they talked about
264000	265000	school lay.
265000	268000	Philosophically and religious.
268000	269000	Right.
269000	270000	Yeah.
270000	272000	The Greeks.
272000	275000	The Greeks saw school lay.
276000	278000	He uses this example.
278000	280000	For example,
280000	282000	Aristotle said that all fear,
282000	283000	fear,
283000	287000	in geometry happens in school lay.
287000	291000	And then in, in the apology, I think it was.
291000	295000	Socrates said that I actually think you guys shouldn't kill me.
295000	296000	I think, I think,
296000	301000	I think Athens should pay me to be in school lay and.
301000	304000	And have, and speak philosophy.
304000	306000	Those conversations, right?
306000	307000	Right. Right.
307000	311000	And so you get this sense with school lay that like for the Greeks,
311000	315000	whereas in leisure, there's a sense in which there's time.
315000	317000	And then you fill time.
317000	321000	And then if, if you work, if you work hard enough and right enough,
321000	322000	and the economy works well,
322000	324000	then you can work for a certain amount of time.
324000	328000	And then at the end you have free time or leisure.
328000	331000	And you notice that conception of time is the same throughout.
331000	334000	It's just a matter of if it's filled with stuff or not filled with stuff.
334000	335000	Yes.
335000	338000	But with something like, with something like theory or,
338000	341000	or philosophy or geometry, right?
341000	346000	At these higher levels of essentially contemplating being.
346000	348000	There's a very, very different sense of time, right?
348000	351000	It's really precisely the pinnacle where, where,
351000	355000	where means and ends come together as one thing.
355000	356000	Love it. Right.
357000	363000	And so bringing this back into me having a kid, right?
363000	367000	And, and everything that we're talking about was attachment, right?
367000	368000	Right.
368000	369000	Totally.
369000	374000	Is for the Greeks.
374000	380000	Skolle, the root of Skolle means holding to hold.
380000	381000	Right.
382000	387000	And that really only makes sense in relationship to time.
387000	392000	So Skolle in the Greek sense was that time was something for
392000	394000	which was of our concern.
394000	398000	It was an essential concern in the sense that there was a way that
398000	401000	if there's a way to hold time,
401000	404000	such that time in turn turns back and holds us.
404000	405000	Love that.
405000	406000	Right.
406000	409000	The Skolle was a way of being in time and holding time,
409000	412000	but then of revealing time, right?
412000	415000	In a way that they're mutually disclosive, right?
415000	418000	And so that was the essence of time itself.
418000	421000	So there's this really sense where meaning in time, right?
421000	425000	Being in time would, would receive their pinnacle.
425000	428000	And it wasn't like you were in Skolle and then not in Skolle.
428000	430000	No, it was more, it was more,
430000	433000	this was connected with the revelation of what time was, right?
433000	436000	Which was the direct concern for us.
436000	441000	And so if you look at it now though, without that sense of time,
441000	446000	where time now is more this kind of anatomical force in which it,
446000	449000	of course we're subject to it and it concerns us,
449000	452000	but there's no sense in which time.
452000	454000	It all responds to us, right?
454000	456000	It's like we're subject to it.
456000	458000	And therefore I think what,
458000	462000	what that's done on some level is we no longer see
462000	465000	meaning in time as unified, right?
465000	467000	Or as a couple.
467000	471000	So therefore time is just this force, right?
471000	473000	That can't really hold meaning.
473000	476000	It can just give lawful,
476000	478000	you can get a lot,
478000	482000	lawful like sustaining an entropy to circumstance.
482000	483000	Therefore,
483000	486000	therefore we need to find meaning in the,
486000	489000	the sensations of our circumstances that you will, right?
489000	493000	Thus the drama, but there's nothing about time that it all
493000	495000	responds to us, right?
495000	498000	And that sense that the Greeks had about it.
498000	500000	And so that in that,
500000	502000	and just this idea that in Schole,
502000	507000	that it's, it's this relationship to the ontology of time that,
507000	509000	that, that, that, that,
509000	513000	that the way I am comport is already a comporting or a holding
513000	516000	of time and that time is that which is holding me.
516000	517000	Right.
517000	519000	And now I think about that.
519000	521000	Now I have a baby, right?
521000	522000	No, I'm thinking about all this.
522000	524000	And now I have a baby, right?
524000	526000	And yeah.
526000	528000	And somebody asked me how Teague was.
528000	530000	And before I responded,
530000	533000	I noticed that I had this picture of Teague, right?
533000	534000	And that,
534000	538000	that I hadn't noticed that there is no Teague to simply Teague
538000	541000	being held, right?
541000	546000	At every picture, like either literally by our hands or held by
546000	549000	our attention or being held by the thing we set up for the crib.
549000	553000	In fact, if there's like a second where we don't have our eye on him,
553000	555000	it's like a big deal, right?
555000	556000	Hey, hey.
556000	558000	And so, right?
558000	560000	And so there's no such thing as Teague.
560000	563000	There's Teague continuous with being held.
563000	564000	Right.
564000	566000	And then if we think about that, right?
566000	567000	So there's something real.
567000	569000	I'm like, okay, what is this,
569000	574000	this connection between time, meaning ontology,
574000	576000	our vulnerability as human beings,
576000	579000	the fact that we primordially start like this,
579000	583000	like a deep vulnerability and an openness to the very holding,
583000	584000	right?
584000	586000	Which then that holding in turn,
586000	589000	hopefully they internalize and as they internalize it,
589000	593000	as he grows up, we will then let go and he will take on the whole
593000	594000	holding.
594000	596000	And so in some sense,
596000	599000	I'm wondering about this idea of holding.
599000	603000	What does that reveal about the ontologically the case with us and
603000	604000	human beings, right?
604000	605000	Totally.
605000	606000	Totally.
606000	607000	All right.
607000	609000	So those are all the thought islands.
609000	610000	Let's see if we can,
610000	612000	we see if we can peer underneath the surface,
612000	614000	pull some sort of synergy out of that.
614000	615000	Yeah.
615000	616000	Yeah.
616000	618000	That's a beautiful set of observations.
618000	619000	Let me just say that. Okay.
619000	620000	I love,
620000	623000	I didn't know about the Greek word skole.
623000	624000	Can you say that?
624000	625000	Okay.
625000	627000	So we know about that word.
627000	631000	So let me give you just some thoughts to start to ground us in,
631000	635000	in relation to the holding environment that we can then cultivate.
635000	636000	Yeah.
636000	637000	Okay.
637000	638000	Yeah.
638000	640000	So the first thing, a couple of things that come to mind,
640000	642000	one is our vertical integration.
642000	643000	Okay.
643000	647000	Vertical integration of us as organisms first.
647000	648000	Okay.
648000	649000	Yeah.
649000	651000	Into animals,
651000	655000	which then is the base of our feeling system.
655000	657000	And we can feel that, you know,
657000	660000	in our gut and our loins and in our gut.
660000	661000	Okay.
661000	665000	And that's the way the position of the body and whether we got pain
665000	669000	or emptiness in our stomach or horny and longs in the loins.
669000	671000	It's an appetite of desires.
671000	673000	It's a very platonic play-toe version.
673000	674000	Yeah.
674000	675000	And that's our animal.
675000	676000	You know,
676000	678000	our organism into animal level from a to K view.
678000	680000	So you're a bio physiological entity.
680000	682000	And then the first thing is, Hey,
682000	683000	you got to take care of survival.
683000	684000	Shit.
684000	685000	You know, right?
685000	686000	Yeah.
686000	689000	And then we're social primates.
689000	690000	Okay.
690000	695000	So then we move into the, what I metaphorically refer to the heart.
695000	696000	Okay.
696000	699000	And the heart's the relationship attachment system.
699000	700000	Okay.
700000	705000	And there's nothing more central to an infant than this.
705000	706000	I mean the whole,
706000	712000	because the entire safety food and relational matrix are all
712000	716000	intimately intertwined in virtually every infant's experience.
716000	717000	Yeah.
717000	718000	Yeah.
718000	720000	And we see that in the holding that,
720000	722000	whether they're being prepared and connected,
722000	723000	they're so dependent.
723000	725000	And for the first six months,
725000	729000	they are completely dependent upon the environment in which they're
729000	730000	held.
730000	731000	Yeah. Right. Yeah.
731000	734000	I know they're, they're, they're absorbing stuff.
734000	735000	They have enormous plasticity.
735000	737000	They're upgrading the various models,
737000	739000	but they're just checking shit out basically.
739000	740000	Yeah.
740000	742000	They have a little bit of hand movement and a lot of,
742000	744000	they put shit in their mouth.
744000	745000	Yes.
745000	747000	And they track everything really fast with the head.
747000	748000	Yeah.
748000	750000	And they have a visual auditory learning system,
750000	753000	but the body is doing, you know, it's barely roll over.
753000	755000	Right. Right. Yes.
755000	756000	Right.
756000	759000	So they're, so the system then in what they're doing from it,
759000	762000	that we can, we spoke about John Bulby. Okay.
762000	765000	So what he noticed is we,
765000	768000	the early systems of psychiatry psychology, well,
768000	769000	the key really is food.
769000	771000	So, you know, we had orphanage.
771000	774000	We just fed them as long as they stayed alive and the temperature
774000	776000	was thing and they didn't have any threat and they were getting
776000	777000	out of bed.
777000	778000	They should be all right.
778000	780000	And then all of these kids and orphanages that weren't being,
780000	782000	we're all broken in some ways, you know,
782000	784000	they were underdeveloped.
784000	789000	They felt the whole socio-emotional systems was out of touch.
789000	792000	They got these weird attachment structures that was a fundamental
792000	794000	set of insecurity.
794000	795000	Okay.
795000	796000	That the,
796000	798000	that the environment would drop out of them at a particular level.
798000	799000	Yeah.
799000	802000	They weren't known and valued and they wouldn't be protected.
802000	803000	Yeah.
803000	806000	And then they had to, they were, kids would respond in certain ways.
806000	809000	You'd either get very hyper dependent. Oh my God.
809000	812000	Just try sending out alarms all the time, hyper neurotic,
812000	815000	sending out certain alarms to be so that they try to get what little
815000	816000	attention they could.
816000	817000	Yeah.
817000	819000	Or they would go avoidant, which is hyper independent.
819000	822000	They try to crush this need of the heart and then be,
822000	825000	I don't need anybody. I'll just try to suppress it.
825000	827000	Or they would get really, especially if they were abused,
827000	831000	then they get really erratic and disorganized attachments.
831000	832000	Okay.
832000	833000	Yeah.
833000	837000	And really this is what later attachment is about the circle.
837000	840000	Of security that you're actually wanting to see build,
840000	843000	which is a fundamental participatory dance between the caregiver.
843000	845000	And the infant.
845000	848000	Where you're tracking eye movements and building a shared attention,
848000	850000	intention, space.
850000	851000	Yeah.
851000	853000	So that you can then create the ground,
853000	856000	the socio-emotional ground that you will be cared for.
856000	859000	And if you have particular needs, you can signal them and I'll be able
859000	861000	to empathize with you and I'll meet them.
861000	862000	Okay.
862000	863000	Yeah.
863000	864000	Yeah.
864000	867000	This creates the ground of the secure base.
867000	871000	From which the infant can go at six months into the next couple of
871000	874000	years and start to move away from the base.
874000	875000	Okay.
875000	876000	Yeah.
876000	878000	And then return to the holding environment.
878000	881000	If it falls, if the kid falls and scrapes his knee,
881000	885000	runs back to mom and dad and gets immediately returned to the holding
885000	886000	environment.
886000	887000	Yeah.
887000	888000	Yeah.
888000	889000	Yeah.
889000	890000	Yeah.
890000	893000	Because the entire primate animal organism system is like check.
893000	894000	Okay.
894000	895000	Am I held safe?
895000	897000	Or am I in the dark woods somewhere by myself?
897000	898000	The ultimate panic, right?
898000	899000	Which is.
899000	900000	Right.
900000	901000	Complete.
901000	902000	Yeah.
902000	903000	Yeah.
903000	906000	You're about to get eaten by a dark man and a tiger in the woods.
906000	907000	Absolutely.
907000	910000	So that's an unbelievable, that darkness is unbelievably,
910000	913000	you know, concerning the poor panic abandonment and the felt sense of
913000	916000	worthlessness and this felt sense of insecurity, you know,
916000	920000	and are you, and then you get polyvagal defensiveness throughout the
920000	922000	system when you're getting this structure.
922000	923000	Yeah.
923000	924000	Okay.
924000	927000	So you're being, you're either being held in the matrix of care or
927000	928000	not.
928000	929000	Yeah.
929000	931000	And those are the two basic secure insecure.
931000	932000	And of course there's a lot in between.
932000	933000	Yeah.
933000	936000	Basically the matrix says there's actually these two equilibrium
936000	940000	states at a bimodal kind of distribution of being held.
940000	943000	And then you track the interpersonal world.
943000	946000	And indeed we know kids can be feel pretty safe with mom and not
946000	949000	with dad or vice versa, depending on the dance, the relation.
949000	952000	It's called the circle of security and the more advanced
952000	954000	simulations that then afford.
954000	955000	Right.
955000	958000	When it's there, it's a particular holding environment.
958000	961000	So, so the, the, when you have that,
961000	965000	you're going to create coherent integration in the environment,
965000	969000	into the body, into the animal, into the social primate.
969000	970000	Okay.
970000	974000	And that's really the first couple of years is trying to create that
974000	976000	fundamental secure base.
976000	981000	So the system can then trust basic trust to use, you know,
981000	984000	the world and that you're going to get your needs met or basic
984000	985000	mistrust.
985000	987000	This is the Ericksonian formulation.
987000	988000	Okay.
988000	989000	A basic trust is mistrust.
989000	990000	Yeah.
990000	991000	That says, Hey,
991000	994000	yes, I will get my needs met because the environment will hold me in
994000	995000	a particular way.
995000	1000000	And the environment holds me because it sees me as valuable.
1000000	1001000	Yes.
1001000	1002000	Exactly.
1002000	1005000	That connection between value and holding, right?
1005000	1007000	And what that means seems to be.
1007000	1008000	Super.
1008000	1010000	Deeply, deeply central. Yeah.
1010000	1013000	And I make a very important point about my own development in this
1013000	1015000	theoretical structure called the influence matrix,
1015000	1019000	which first emphasized it from an evolutionary instrumental way,
1019000	1022000	which is totally valid, but it's incomplete originally.
1022000	1025000	And that is what I call that the social influence line.
1025000	1026000	Okay.
1026000	1030000	And social and it was to bind in sort of instrumental terms,
1030000	1033000	to what extent can you influence others in accordance with your
1033000	1034000	interests?
1034000	1035000	Okay.
1035000	1037000	If I cry, will you come help me?
1037000	1038000	Or will you ignore me?
1038000	1040000	So it's an instrumental framing,
1040000	1043000	which at a pragmatic level of survival is key.
1043000	1044000	However,
1044000	1047000	what I saw in the clinic room is that a lot of people could have
1047000	1050000	influence, but feel very empty inside.
1050000	1051000	Okay.
1051000	1053000	And they would go around and they wouldn't,
1053000	1055000	or they would feel that they were not valued.
1055000	1059000	And I realized that actually the ultimate sort of core,
1059000	1061000	even from an evolutionary perspective,
1061000	1064000	the core equilibrium safe space is to be valued,
1064000	1067000	not just to be able to manipulate others instrumentally.
1067000	1069000	Cause if the contingency of manipulation disappears,
1069000	1070000	then the,
1070000	1073000	then there's no intrinsic motive for mom and dad to love you.
1073000	1074000	Then they're out of it.
1074000	1075000	Okay.
1075000	1076000	Yeah.
1076000	1077000	But if they're totally,
1077000	1081000	if their motivational system is attached to you by its own valuing
1081000	1082000	structure,
1082000	1086000	then that at a particular level, that's really key.
1086000	1089000	The other thing that's going to get back into why this is so
1089000	1093000	important is because modern science basically thinks and economics
1093000	1097000	thinks in terms of instrumental means and relationship and trying
1097000	1099000	to maximize productive control.
1099000	1100000	Okay.
1100000	1101000	They then, in fact,
1101000	1103000	the entire social capital laborers basically,
1103000	1107000	influence and investment and return on investment in instrumentality,
1107000	1109000	modes of production and control.
1109000	1110000	Okay.
1110000	1111000	Yeah.
1111000	1112000	So the whole thing basically is like,
1112000	1116000	how do we efficiently maximize our influence and power over the
1116000	1120000	things for the least amount of money in relationship to particular
1120000	1121000	outcomes.
1121000	1124000	So now you create the doing instrumental mindset.
1124000	1128000	That then fundamentally merges as the dominant mode.
1128000	1133000	And this now brings in Eric from the dominant mode of doing that then
1133000	1137000	becomes so salient for the way in which we all think that's a
1137000	1139000	quantifiable and, you know,
1139000	1142000	many scientists see the behavioral and evolutionary sciences.
1142000	1144000	Oh, we're all just selfish anyway.
1144000	1146000	And this is what we really care about and blah, blah, blah.
1146000	1147000	Yeah.
1147000	1149000	And you know, what you can do is you, you know,
1149000	1151000	there is really any God, there's no real purpose,
1151000	1153000	but you can at least get the most toys that you have.
1153000	1155000	And get as much accomplishment.
1155000	1158000	And then that's, that's the doing of what, you know,
1158000	1161000	you get rich and you get status and you get leisure time.
1161000	1162000	And that's what you're trying to get.
1162000	1163000	Yeah.
1163000	1164000	You know, do, do, do.
1164000	1165000	Yes.
1165000	1166000	Okay.
1166000	1167000	Right.
1167000	1169000	So we'll love you, but at least we can hack it.
1169000	1170000	Yeah.
1170000	1171000	At least we can hack it.
1171000	1172000	At least I can get the most.
1172000	1173000	Yeah.
1173000	1174000	At least we can hack it.
1174000	1175000	At least I can get the most toys.
1175000	1177000	But like, at least we can hack that.
1177000	1178000	That's right.
1178000	1181000	I got a big fucking Vita that's going to substitute, you know,
1181000	1182000	for true love,
1182000	1185000	but at least I got a big fucking Vita or have a nice Lamborghini
1185000	1186000	or something or not.
1186000	1188000	And then you're on the low shit.
1188000	1190000	And you can't do, and then you fail and all of that.
1190000	1191000	Yeah.
1191000	1192000	Yeah.
1192000	1194000	And then it's like, well, okay, well, what am I doing here?
1194000	1196000	Well, I'm just trying to, I'm trying to,
1196000	1198000	everything's a means to an end relation.
1198000	1199000	I mean, look at money.
1199000	1201000	I mean, to the extent that then money becomes the symbol.
1201000	1203000	It's the ultimate instrumental symbol.
1203000	1205000	Yeah. For some people, they get it so confused.
1205000	1207000	I was like, I want to make more money.
1207000	1208000	You know, it's like,
1208000	1210000	as if that is some sort of quantifying in it.
1210000	1212000	That's empty calories at the core.
1212000	1213000	Yeah.
1213000	1214000	Yeah.
1214000	1215000	Yeah.
1215000	1216000	Yeah.
1216000	1217000	And I think that we're,
1217000	1222000	we have driven the doing mode to try to control energy and time
1222000	1227000	in an instrumental kind of way to enormous excess.
1227000	1228000	Okay.
1228000	1229000	Yeah.
1229000	1233000	And then that's not good calories for feeling,
1233000	1236000	spending time in an attached relational environment,
1236000	1237000	in nature,
1237000	1241000	feeling the oneness of the self-world modeling structure,
1241000	1242000	feeling held by that,
1242000	1246000	feeling fundamentally present and fulfilled in relationship to it,
1246000	1249000	feeling the integration between the body,
1249000	1251000	into the animal, into the heart,
1251000	1253000	into the justification, into the spirit,
1253000	1255000	mattering value purpose.
1255000	1257000	That's what I call vertical integration.
1257000	1258000	Okay.
1258000	1260000	So if you get vertical integration,
1260000	1261000	I would say then for me,
1261000	1263000	the label is wisdom energy.
1263000	1266000	And what you feel is just a massive presence,
1266000	1270000	a fundamental fit between the self-world environment
1270000	1272000	and a massive presencing of that.
1272000	1273000	Yeah.
1273000	1276000	And then that is a eudaimonic ultimate endpoint.
1276000	1278000	You are then in,
1278000	1279000	in sync,
1279000	1283000	incoherent integrative sync with the system.
1283000	1284000	Yeah.
1284000	1286000	And then finally to bring it back to kind of the leisure,
1286000	1288000	I feel like I got lucky with Socrates.
1288000	1289000	I'm a public intellectual.
1289000	1290000	I get paid.
1290000	1292000	And I tell people at the level of leisure,
1292000	1293000	it's like,
1293000	1295000	people are like, well, how often, how much do you work?
1295000	1296000	I was like, well,
1296000	1298000	I work either five or 75 hours a week,
1298000	1300000	depending on how you calculate it.
1300000	1301000	Okay.
1301000	1302000	Yeah.
1302000	1303000	Yes.
1303000	1304000	Because, you know,
1304000	1306000	I have five hours of shit I need to do that is the kind of labor.
1306000	1307000	And, you know,
1307000	1309000	here's a paperwork thing, sign this prep.
1309000	1310000	This is like,
1310000	1311000	while I'm doing it,
1311000	1312000	the only thing I'm doing is for,
1312000	1314000	for instrumental purpose to get something done.
1314000	1318000	But I'm super lucky that I'm now at a place as full professor,
1318000	1319000	blah, blah, blah.
1319000	1321000	That's like a huge amount of work like this.
1321000	1322000	Is this work?
1322000	1324000	You know, are we are, am I, I don't, I love this.
1324000	1327000	I feel that enormously just present.
1327000	1329000	I feel connected to you.
1329000	1331000	I feel our souls connected in a particular way.
1331000	1333000	And then we engage in D a logos.
1333000	1334000	And then that's a,
1334000	1339000	then my experience of being in the world is just enriched by
1339000	1340000	these things.
1340000	1341000	So yeah.
1341000	1342000	No, it's like, you know,
1342000	1344000	it's productive and in growth promoting,
1344000	1346000	but it doesn't feel like I've had to,
1346000	1349000	I'm trying to control something to get to some place.
1349000	1353000	I'm in the place of being itself.
1353000	1354000	Yeah.
1354000	1355000	And that's,
1355000	1358000	and there's somehow in some sense implicitly there.
1358000	1362000	And it's a couple of things that kind of link all of that together
1362000	1364000	all the way down to that.
1364000	1366000	Like,
1366000	1367000	you know,
1367000	1370000	I started with the first six months because the second six months,
1370000	1371000	right.
1371000	1378000	All the way is like mature professor. Right.
1378000	1380000	One is it sounds like your relationship with time is very,
1380000	1381000	very different, right.
1381000	1386000	In some sense that there is a way that you relate to time that seems
1386000	1387000	like these things,
1387000	1391000	these meetings or something like the pinnacle or express this
1391000	1393000	fundamental relationship where you're.
1393000	1395800	There is a sense in which it holds you and inspires you.
1395800	1398080	There's time disappears.
1398080	1401120	There's the flow state, Deologos, all of that.
1401120	1402400	Totally.
1402400	1404280	Now, it's interesting too that
1407880	1410880	this sense about when you talked about
1412200	1413880	after the first six months and then they start,
1413880	1415760	the child starts to venture away from the holding
1415760	1417080	and then they come back, right?
1417080	1419520	It's such a cool image of that,
1419520	1421600	because you can see that too, because they do.
1421600	1423240	They venture out, they're like,
1423240	1424640	they'll check back and then they'll go,
1424640	1426400	oh, they're gonna see what they gotta do.
1426400	1427760	And then they'll check back really quick,
1427760	1428920	are you still there, right?
1428920	1432000	Like, you're still there, I'll go out and then you look back,
1432000	1432840	right?
1432840	1436560	They're test, they intrinsically are testing something.
1436560	1437400	That's right.
1437400	1439960	And, and God, and there's so many different ways
1439960	1441720	that could get fucked up, right?
1441720	1443960	Like, cause I was thinking about that when,
1443960	1446320	if the, what happens when the child comes back
1446320	1448320	and then the mother's destroyed and angry
1448320	1451000	because the child left her, right?
1451000	1454440	Like, and then, and so there's all kinds of ways
1454440	1458680	that that dynamic relation can get all whacked out, right?
1458680	1461920	And then usually it stresses itself in all these,
1461920	1463960	you know, in broken marriages and-
1463960	1466000	Well, we're right, and then we test it all the time
1466000	1466840	for good reason.
1466840	1469560	You're like, hey, I'm gonna, I'll drop a cry over here
1469560	1470560	or I won't do other things.
1470560	1472520	And it was not with conscious justification,
1472520	1475360	but the design of the system is to know where it is.
1475360	1478200	So, and we do this with our spouses, you test them.
1478840	1479680	Yeah.
1479680	1481800	You drop little, I mean, not like very rarely,
1481800	1483720	I'm gonna adjust my, some people that,
1483720	1485400	but you do it intuitively
1485400	1488040	because you want to see where the value and attention is.
1488040	1488880	Okay?
1488880	1491920	Like, I mean, my kids, I mean, they've got five and three
1491920	1493520	and you know, you cut two pieces of cake,
1493520	1495640	hey, his cake's bigger than mine.
1495640	1498200	And I was like, and I was like, okay,
1498200	1499720	but you know, they're gonna check that
1499720	1502040	and they're gonna be like, hey, you cut it
1502040	1504200	and that reflects something in your heart, doesn't it?
1504200	1505920	You love him more than you love me.
1505920	1507600	Or you better draw attention to that.
1507640	1509160	You know, there's a little, you know,
1509160	1510840	that's a chronic state of,
1510840	1512400	is this environment really holding
1512400	1514480	and then I'll test it and see what happens.
1514480	1515320	You know, really.
1515320	1517040	Right, totally.
1517040	1517880	Like I,
1520240	1522680	well, the other thing about that that I didn't,
1522680	1526040	I think I saw as you're talking about this differently
1526040	1527520	than I saw it before,
1527520	1531440	which is this back and forth, right, relation,
1532560	1536640	that it's really, it's, it, how dynamic it is.
1536640	1539440	It's like, I know we talk about it in terms of like,
1539440	1543680	okay, is that, is the child starts to objectify, right?
1543680	1545320	Will that object hold me, right?
1545320	1546360	Is that all?
1546360	1548120	But really when we look at it this set,
1548120	1551720	they're not actually checking to a thing,
1551720	1554600	but that the stability is precisely a way
1554600	1557440	of a modal of relations happening, right?
1557440	1559880	So it's not like there's something stable
1559880	1561120	in a thing-like way.
1561120	1564200	It's a dynamic, a nexus of relations that are going on.
1564200	1565040	Totally.
1565040	1568480	Which they start to feel a certain kind of safety with.
1568480	1571920	And of course, the world is a chaotic network of relations,
1571920	1574080	right, that they're trying to tolerate
1574080	1576120	and then go back and forth.
1576120	1576960	Right.
1576960	1578400	And that, and that that's actually,
1578400	1580160	and that it's also,
1580160	1583960	it seems to me this relationship in some sense,
1583960	1586560	that seems that back and forth implies
1586560	1589720	a certain temporality, right?
1589720	1590560	Nope.
1590560	1591400	In some way.
1591400	1592240	Sure.
1592240	1593240	All right.
1593240	1594520	Is my past.
1594520	1596080	If I turn around and I look back,
1596080	1597400	will it still be there?
1597400	1598240	Right?
1599520	1601120	This future, right?
1601120	1602680	There's something drawing me in
1602680	1603840	that I don't know about yet.
1603840	1604960	Therefore it's chaotic,
1604960	1606800	but then I'll turn around this past
1606800	1609000	and this back and forth movement seems,
1610040	1613400	I would imagine that's probably one of the,
1613400	1616280	there's something there about temporality.
1616280	1617120	Right.
1617120	1617960	Well, the system starts to be able
1617960	1619600	to extend itself over time.
1619600	1621120	That's one of the first things, okay?
1621120	1623160	So then the way in which you,
1623160	1625600	I mean, at first it's pretty immediate.
1625600	1627880	And then the capacity to then,
1627880	1630120	and indeed it is the argument that John and I
1630120	1632280	and Chris were making in the elusive eye was,
1632280	1635120	it is this capacity to begin to extend the self over time
1635120	1637880	through multiplicity of possible simulations
1637880	1640080	where the environment then changes as you,
1640080	1642960	but then it is the extension of self in that time
1642960	1646320	that really starts to give this self agent environment
1646320	1650000	relation and then the self other relational matrix
1650000	1652440	that then creates the model of the self.
1652520	1654600	Okay, so that means that we start to carry
1654600	1655880	and then we extend.
1655880	1659640	So that issue of who am I across time,
1659640	1662800	basically becomes the modeling structures
1662800	1665640	that afford you the opportunity to get a grip,
1665640	1666720	on the world.
1666720	1670880	So how you build that is through the attachments
1670880	1673400	of first mom and dad need to be present
1673400	1675720	or there needs to be a security system present
1675720	1677160	at first six months.
1677160	1679440	Then all of a sudden that it begins to extend
1679440	1681880	into an autonomy versus shame and doubt.
1681880	1684680	That's the next lace title, which is autonomy is like,
1684680	1686920	hey, I can now actually start to exhibit.
1686920	1689000	I have the motor work and cognitive capacity
1689000	1691000	start to exhibit control over the world
1691000	1693600	and distance myself, okay?
1693600	1695760	But as soon as I get distance in any way out here
1695760	1698680	in the darkness and I'm still just learning shit,
1698680	1700400	it all of a sudden becomes a dark, scary world.
1700400	1703280	Now I have to quickly touch, is mom gonna be there?
1703280	1706880	You know, if I move away, you know, when I look back.
1706880	1710120	And so then you have to expand the temporality
1710120	1712640	of the field of consideration
1712640	1716320	because now the opportunity across time is increasing
1716320	1718320	and you have to start to really protect
1718320	1720120	what's going on in relationship to that.
1720120	1721160	Right.
1721160	1724360	I mean, so interesting just to kind of grok this sense of
1725720	1728960	if I turn around and if I look up and it gets scary
1728960	1730880	and I turn around, are they still there?
1730880	1735880	That there is so linked to value, right?
1736400	1739440	Am I valued enough such that people stay around, right?
1739440	1742720	It's so interesting to think about it like that, right?
1742720	1745680	Being valued is so primary.
1745680	1746520	Totally.
1746520	1747600	That's it.
1747600	1750080	The fund, that is the core of the heart soul
1750080	1752280	is to be known and valued by important others,
1752280	1753720	at least according to the unified theory.
1753720	1756480	It's the fundamental calories, okay?
1756480	1758080	Of that part of your psyche.
1758080	1760760	And it's absolutely as crucial as good calories
1760760	1763400	for the body, you know, it's a fundamental
1763400	1765480	in some ways even, you know, at the level.
1765480	1767400	So am I known and valued?
1767400	1768840	It's not just can I manipulate them
1768840	1773840	but fundamentally they care about me, you know,
1773840	1775720	and my essence, okay?
1775720	1778320	And in non-contingent ways, they care about me.
1778320	1779600	Yeah, yeah.
1779600	1781200	That's what people really track
1781200	1783080	and they desperately need.
1783080	1785320	And unfortunately, because of our humanness though,
1785320	1787240	we get to a stage where we can,
1787240	1790320	there's an access to the interior through justification,
1790320	1792680	which they need to start talking, okay?
1792680	1794680	And little kids don't have to deal with this as much
1794680	1796280	but as you start to get older,
1796280	1799600	you can then the cognitive capacities of justification
1799600	1800920	start to say, well, okay,
1800920	1802880	I know mom wants to hear shit from me
1802880	1804000	or dad wants to hear shit
1804000	1805640	or my friends want to hear shit
1805640	1806920	and they can ask me questions.
1806920	1811760	So then I find myself basically generating a persona,
1811760	1814840	public justification out here, okay?
1814840	1816880	And that creates then the opportunity
1816880	1818560	for imposter syndromes,
1818560	1821640	which then emerge in middle to older childhood,
1821640	1824480	where you actually start to then create a public face,
1824480	1826280	a persona, that's young call,
1826280	1830120	that the mask that you then wear in relation
1830120	1831520	and you realize you do that
1831520	1833240	for social influence purposes,
1833240	1834800	meaning because you wear the mask,
1834800	1837000	you avoid their judgment in a particular way
1837000	1838840	or you obtain their praise.
1838840	1839680	But at the same time,
1839680	1843840	it creates a fundamental social versus core self-split
1843840	1845080	because it's like this,
1845080	1848240	they love me now as a function of the contingencies
1848240	1849480	that I give them.
1849480	1852120	But if they really knew me, I'm terrified they wouldn't.
1852120	1854280	That way I see that all the time in a relationship
1854280	1857800	to once adolescents start to struggle with mental health
1857800	1861240	and it creates this very, very brutal dichotomy
1861240	1862840	and there's no holding environment there
1862840	1864480	that can be really generated,
1864480	1866080	that's fundamentally embodied
1866080	1867400	because you can't really,
1867400	1870600	you can't bring yourself to test if so you fake it,
1870600	1873200	but you then don't trust that you would actually be held.
1873200	1875120	I have many, many clients
1875120	1876480	who had to work through that process
1876480	1879600	to afford coherent integration along those lines.
1880600	1883360	In fact, you were just saying,
1883360	1886960	because I too, because I work with people one-on-one too
1886960	1889840	and in so many cases,
1889840	1891440	like I just started to,
1891440	1893480	it's at the point where I could just kind of almost
1893480	1895440	look for it, right?
1895440	1899040	There's something like life was fine, right?
1899040	1903000	Everything was fluid, I was loved and then we moved.
1903000	1904520	And then there was a new school
1904520	1906400	and then I had to like,
1906400	1908160	and then there's the socialization, right?
1908760	1911320	The break with something, some kind of security
1911320	1913120	and then there in a new social matrix
1913120	1914840	and then there's all these breakdowns
1914840	1916840	and on some level, right?
1916840	1917680	That's,
1919560	1921720	there, so much of their personality
1921720	1925400	has been defined in that adaptation, right?
1925400	1927560	Which has all these dichotomies in it, right?
1927560	1929600	And that's usually what we end up talking about, right?
1929600	1933280	Are issues around that fundamental break, yeah.
1933280	1934880	Totally, exactly.
1934880	1937280	And then that activates the insecurity
1937280	1939400	of not being held in the environment.
1939400	1942160	And then people struggle with various strategies,
1942160	1946360	testing, defenses, coping strategies, et cetera.
1946360	1949280	And if they are constrained and limited
1949280	1950960	and they also lead to additional problems,
1950960	1953280	you get an entrenched maladaptive problem
1953280	1954840	of a social phobia,
1954840	1957600	a fundamental sense of insecurity and inability
1957600	1958960	to articulate what's going on,
1958960	1960840	a hyper-reactivity of the vulnerability
1960840	1962640	because you're always on edge.
1962640	1965520	And then of course that makes you very difficult
1965520	1969760	to then engender the risks that are necessary
1969760	1972120	and they perceive them often as great risks
1972120	1974440	to then go out and try to find
1974440	1977240	a new secure identification matrix.
1977240	1981440	Identification matrix is the self-world identity process.
1981440	1983120	So these are the elements of the world.
1983120	1985160	It's my map of that, not necessarily conscious,
1985160	1987000	but just intuitively the way you map it.
1987000	1988120	My place in that world
1988120	1989280	and this is what's gonna happen to me
1989280	1992280	if I behave in X, Y, and Z ways.
1992280	1994160	Right, right, right.
1996280	2001280	You know, the sense about, right,
2002360	2005360	one of the things that's interesting to me about this
2005360	2009040	is this, you can see through all of this
2009040	2012480	that, you know, I often talk about it like this.
2012480	2015600	It's like, you know, do you,
2015600	2019200	I don't know about all of biology,
2019200	2022760	but like in terms of mammals,
2022760	2024920	I don't think there's anything more helpless
2024920	2027000	than the human infant, is there?
2027000	2028280	Not even close.
2028280	2030120	Not even close.
2030120	2032080	And what's interesting about this,
2032080	2033840	this has always struck me as like,
2035000	2037440	we all start off like that.
2037440	2042440	Like the way we start is completely dependent,
2042800	2046640	completely helpless in every dimension
2046640	2047800	that you can imagine.
2047800	2048640	Totally.
2049560	2054560	And who's going to Mars, right?
2054960	2057640	Who's on top of the food chain?
2057640	2059560	Who's, right?
2059560	2061680	Who's the one, as far as we can tell,
2061680	2063080	I mean, who knows ultimately,
2063080	2064200	but as far as we can tell,
2064200	2068560	who's the one that caught a sight of its own existence
2068560	2072360	and then can relate back with that existence, right?
2072360	2075160	Even that, you can feel a kind of vulnerability
2075160	2079040	or transparency or porousness going on.
2079040	2079920	And I think about this,
2079920	2082560	and this is where it starts to get kind of ontologically
2082560	2083720	where I want to bring this in.
2083720	2086040	And I'm just curious how this weaves together
2087360	2090800	is, so there's a deep vulnerability
2090800	2095800	that seems to afford the highest levels of theoria, right?
2098280	2103280	Of mystical realization, right?
2106840	2108480	Deep conceptualization, right?
2108480	2113240	These unitary things and abstractions
2113960	2115360	and all of that, right?
2117640	2122640	And in one sense, there's this helplessness
2124240	2126920	that also, right?
2126920	2129320	And in this relationship with that vulnerability,
2129320	2130800	in its hold-it, right?
2130800	2131720	Yes.
2131720	2136560	And it's all, so if you think about this statement,
2136560	2141560	I think it's Jesus, I think he says this in the Bible,
2141640	2143360	I'm so not up on that stuff,
2143360	2148160	but where he says, the meek shall inherit the earth.
2148160	2149720	You think about that statement, right?
2149720	2153520	Such a weird thing at face value,
2153520	2156680	the meek shall inherit the earth.
2156680	2159520	When you think about it like that, right?
2159520	2161160	Like in the terms we're talking about,
2161160	2163600	you can start to get where you're talking about.
2163600	2166200	Like that there is a way that,
2166200	2169240	and I think what he's basically saying is,
2170240	2174160	the meek, when loved, right?
2174160	2179160	That can potentuate this vulnerability
2179760	2182840	into something very, very powerful, right?
2184960	2189280	And so there's that part of it that's just,
2189280	2190600	it seems I'm wondering,
2190600	2192560	it's like there's something ontologically
2192560	2195680	about vulnerability and holding, right?
2195680	2197720	That is expressed here.
2198680	2203680	And then also, but it also strikes me that as human,
2204040	2207080	oops, sorry about that.
2207080	2207920	That's fine.
2209000	2211040	I've got to figure out a way so when it calls,
2211040	2212400	it doesn't blank out.
2215200	2216520	You know, it's like, yeah,
2216520	2220400	so that something about the essence of being human, right?
2220400	2223200	Is really, really tied with being vulnerable.
2223200	2225680	But like, I don't know anybody.
2225680	2227160	In fact, I've been teaching courses
2227560	2231400	for years and I've never had anyone sit,
2231400	2233160	not once have I ever had anybody say,
2233160	2235200	respond to me when I've said,
2235200	2237880	well, hey, maybe this is a good time to be vulnerable,
2237880	2240800	where they're like, oh, I'm so,
2240800	2242960	I was, someone had to say it, right?
2242960	2244120	Thank God.
2244120	2247760	No, it's always this sense of like, oh, like, all right,
2247760	2251800	right, that on one level,
2251800	2254720	our humanity seems to be very much
2254760	2257200	about this deep vulnerability, right?
2257200	2259880	But there's a level at which it can be,
2259880	2263200	we can also be exposed, right?
2263200	2265120	Which is I think what we're really afraid of
2265120	2267560	when we talk about being afraid of being vulnerable,
2267560	2269880	but we're really, really afraid of
2269880	2271520	is we collapse that with being,
2271520	2275160	with the involuntary sense of being subject
2275160	2277800	to something in which I'm exposed to,
2277800	2279560	which I think is really, really different.
2279560	2281560	Vulnerability seems to, at least in my mind,
2281560	2286560	has more of a sense of I'm voluntary, right?
2287040	2289680	There's some sense of I'm willing, right,
2289680	2292160	to be vulnerable, both will, positive sense,
2292160	2295760	and willing, right, and the generative sense.
2297320	2302320	And, but when that holding environment, right, breaks down,
2307280	2310160	and we develop defenses,
2310160	2311880	and so I don't wanna be human,
2311880	2314880	so what I do is I put a shell around myself.
2314880	2317480	But here's the paradox, it's like the moment,
2317480	2319320	the moment I put a shell around myself,
2319320	2322880	and this is why our psychological defense
2322880	2325680	is on one level work, but the cost to them are great.
2325680	2326880	I think it has to do with this,
2326880	2328760	is because the moment I put a shell around myself
2328760	2331880	is the moment I become brittle, right?
2331880	2336880	So, and it seems to me that this relationship to,
2337880	2342200	because on some level, you could say the mystic
2342200	2347000	realizing on the top of the mountain, realizing being, right?
2347000	2349560	You could almost see that is in some sense
2349560	2354440	a profound relationship with his own vulnerability,
2354440	2356040	such that he's so vulnerable,
2356040	2359240	that he's vulnerable to the deepest depths of himself,
2359240	2361000	and transparent to it,
2361000	2364120	such that he realizes the ultimate depth of oneness,
2364160	2366080	and then paradoxically,
2366080	2367880	in that full realization of vulnerability,
2367880	2369520	he's invulnerable, right?
2369520	2370840	Because he's everything, right?
2370840	2372800	We think about that as a symbol.
2372800	2373680	Yeah.
2373680	2376480	And this kind of, this ontological sense,
2376480	2378000	this verticality, right,
2378000	2382280	that has to do with holding time vulnerability,
2383280	2384720	bringing those things together.
2387720	2389760	What stands out for you in that?
2389760	2390920	Well, a couple of things.
2391880	2395120	So, yes, I think you're, first off,
2395120	2400120	we should highlight the vulnerability aspect of our nature.
2400920	2403400	That we're born into the world vulnerable.
2405160	2407360	And then that affords us a wonderful set
2407360	2412360	of both opportunities and serious risks at multiple levels.
2413000	2415280	And then our potentialities are structured
2415280	2419160	around trying to mitigate and navigate those risks.
2419280	2420400	Okay.
2420400	2422600	And potentially can be realized
2422600	2424400	through a huge amount of affordance.
2424400	2425720	Okay, so let's just talk this through.
2425720	2427520	So, I think the bottom line,
2427520	2430080	why are we so vulnerable from an evolutionary perspective?
2430080	2431440	I think the fundamental answer
2431440	2434600	is because we're incredibly plastic, okay?
2434600	2436960	I was just listening to Heather hiring on Jim Rutt,
2436960	2439320	and she was like, from hunter-gatherer perspective,
2439320	2441480	we're sort of the niche generalizers,
2441480	2443360	meaning that we can bounce from,
2443360	2444840	one of the things about it is we can bounce
2444840	2447080	from niche to niche, okay?
2447080	2451480	And learn strategies in a wide variety of addition niches.
2451480	2454360	I mean, that's what our cognitive language,
2454360	2456040	collective intelligence capacities,
2456040	2458840	our creative capacities afford us that.
2458840	2459920	How the hell do you, though,
2459920	2462080	get all the cognitive gadgets
2462080	2463600	and the availability to do that?
2463600	2468600	Well, super long time of development, you know?
2468760	2471240	And the other thing that probably the mechanics
2471240	2472280	of the size of the head,
2472280	2473960	then that requires to hold the brain,
2473960	2475720	and then the birthing process is like,
2475720	2477960	well, you can't stay in there forever.
2477960	2480880	We're already have serious problems at birth.
2480880	2483080	It's a hell of a process, right?
2483080	2484120	Yeah.
2484120	2485880	So you got to get the thing out of there
2485880	2489880	really before it's ready, basically.
2489880	2491320	And now all of a sudden you have this really,
2491320	2496040	neotony is the extended period of neonatal development.
2496040	2499400	And Steven J. Gould points out that this is a really,
2499400	2502280	almost certainly a central feature of our development.
2502280	2504800	So nature basically says, all right,
2504840	2506400	we're going to get systems
2506400	2510960	that can have this unbelievable cognitive learning flexibility
2510960	2512320	that they can learn repertoires
2512320	2514560	and then repertoire off a top so that they,
2514560	2516480	most animals just learn repertoires.
2516480	2518520	We earn repertoires on top of our repertoires.
2518520	2520920	They've put them all together in evolutionary new ways
2520920	2522480	through our learning.
2522480	2524600	And then now we justify on top of that.
2524600	2525760	So we are really do,
2525760	2528560	our behavioral flexibility is really in a class by its set,
2528560	2529400	okay?
2529400	2533040	To get there, the system has to have be able to download
2533080	2534880	and manipulate all that.
2534880	2538560	Plus, so then it comes out very, very vulnerable.
2538560	2541520	So now let's think about what that means about our condition.
2541520	2545840	If I am fed and held well, okay,
2545840	2549080	I can then grow and network into a collective intelligence
2549080	2550640	that is enormous amount of power
2550640	2553360	and be a part of something belonging.
2554560	2556560	Actually, my doctoral student is probably going to do
2556560	2560560	a dissertation on suicide called the ontology of belonging
2560560	2563600	and suicidal behavior in adolescence, okay?
2563600	2568080	And basically it's the ecology and ontology of belonging
2568080	2572200	in her estimation that affords coherent integration.
2572200	2574440	And what gets deviated for so many people
2574440	2575720	is the breakdown in that.
2575720	2578400	And then an internalized critical looping
2578400	2580760	that then alienates and leads to psychic
2580760	2584400	and then a crash and burn and have alienation.
2584400	2586120	And you can see then that you have this whole,
2586120	2587480	all of this potential,
2587480	2589520	first off, you might get neglected and abused.
2589520	2591600	That's horrifying, right?
2591600	2595240	Or you might get situated so that you're in a contingency
2595240	2597000	where you have to fake it,
2597000	2598560	but then you feel empty inside.
2598560	2602840	That's another sort of developmental line,
2602840	2604440	an aberrant or atypical
2604440	2606480	or less than fulfilling developmental line.
2606480	2608960	And then there's this enormous potential
2608960	2612960	to grow in connection with each other in nature
2612960	2616080	in a fulfilled way because of the enormous plasticity
2616080	2619440	and learning potential of the structure of the system.
2619760	2623960	So our developmental trajectories are enormously variable.
2625400	2627880	And so the idea that we're sort of like trying to track,
2627880	2629280	oh, guys, is this a bad sign?
2629280	2630480	Is this a good sign?
2630480	2634880	Where are we and have potentials that afford that?
2634880	2636160	The other thing that I was thinking of
2636160	2637000	when you were talking,
2637000	2639120	I hooked up with a theorist a while ago
2640720	2645320	who really centered on this core split of our potential.
2645320	2649240	He actually called his framework called the one divide, okay?
2649240	2652080	And he basically argued that birth and early events
2652080	2655080	inevitably result in trauma, okay?
2655080	2658480	And then you have the activation
2658480	2661560	of the low relational value, low social influence,
2661560	2665560	panic of abandonment, death, desertion, okay?
2665560	2668120	And that core panic is something
2668120	2671680	that you are really programmed to like void.
2671680	2674640	I was like, oh my God, am I gonna be seen
2674640	2678400	and devalued and dejected and removed, okay?
2678400	2681600	So then what happens then is the self system
2681600	2684160	begins to model what makes me vulnerable
2684160	2687880	and then how do I create a defensive self-structure
2687880	2691320	that's trying to compensate and avoid and control
2691320	2692360	in an instrumental way,
2692360	2695120	the avoidance and discovery of that abandonment.
2696160	2697920	And he argues that many, many people,
2697920	2698760	and I think this is true,
2698760	2703440	many people then live their lives essentially on the cusp.
2703440	2705480	This is really a felt sense of insecurity
2706120	2710000	you're building a defended character armor structure,
2710000	2711600	Wright talks about character armor
2711600	2712920	from a psychodynamic perspective,
2712920	2715240	you build this up and the function of that
2715240	2719200	is to avoid the terror with the fear
2719200	2721480	that if you fail to do this, you would be revealed
2721480	2722320	and you'd be rejected
2722320	2725680	and you have a fundamental abandonment, okay?
2725680	2727720	The structure of that,
2727720	2730120	if you think the vertical integration structure of that,
2730120	2733040	it's basically, it's an empty dark core
2733040	2734960	that is speaking to you constantly
2734960	2737280	and the rest of your character structure
2737280	2742280	then is a compensation to try to avoid falling into something.
2742720	2743840	Yeah.
2743840	2744680	Yeah.
2744680	2745520	Think about that.
2745520	2746840	Yeah, it's like, exactly.
2746840	2748480	Like, ah, you know.
2748480	2751080	And that is, and now I need to work really hard
2751080	2756080	to build stuff and then the felt sense of existence is,
2756080	2757560	how far can I stay away from it?
2757560	2759120	But everything then you're doing
2759120	2761120	is actually negatively reinforcing.
2761120	2762760	And what that means is you do shit
2762760	2765880	so that you avoid the potential horror of consequence.
2765880	2769440	And it takes a little bit of the edge off periodically
2769440	2771280	but then you have to keep doing stuff
2771280	2774200	to keep the abyss falling away.
2774200	2776840	I've met a lot of people that live their lives like that
2776840	2778840	and it is, it's pretty tragic
2778840	2781640	because the entire structure of being
2781640	2782760	then is like, it's just,
2782760	2785280	how do I avoid falling into abyss
2785280	2789080	as opposed to how do I live in the divine bliss?
2789080	2789920	Okay.
2789920	2790760	Yeah.
2790760	2792880	The fullness, not the negation.
2792880	2793720	Exactly.
2793720	2795760	It's like, oh my God.
2795760	2798240	You mean to say that I can be valued
2798240	2800400	and value that into my animal body,
2800400	2805120	into my soul and my cells and feel at oneness
2805120	2808720	with the sense of divine, with the ultimate purpose,
2808720	2813080	with the negentropic complex, coordinated,
2813080	2814160	integrated processes.
2814160	2816920	That's my spirit into my system of justification.
2816920	2817920	Then you drop into that
2817920	2819440	and you just feel a perspectival,
2819440	2824240	a heart flood with a sense of appreciation, gratitude, love,
2824240	2826800	awe, all of that, and then down into the body.
2826800	2829640	And that is, then that's the true self,
2829640	2831760	what he calls the true self integration.
2831760	2834760	And it creates the basically the stack
2834760	2837240	of an affirming belief system in spirit
2837240	2838800	that has some sense making,
2838800	2840920	that makes sense of the heart that's known and valued,
2840920	2843560	that's into the body that's felt held and secure
2843560	2845160	in the environment itself.
2845160	2846960	And then I think one of the things
2846960	2849040	that we should be really emphasizing,
2849040	2850800	my friend Rob Scott emphasized this,
2850800	2854440	calls it the fundamental shift is those moments
2854440	2859440	of being itself are the awe-inspiring glory
2860800	2865800	of being itself and to be just in the moment of awareness,
2866280	2867640	of fundamental awareness
2867640	2870560	and to cultivate the taste of that beauty,
2870560	2873120	of awareness itself.
2873120	2874800	I mean, I find that to be,
2874800	2876800	and then you get back to the whole leisure place,
2876800	2880920	is sort of like to have the opportunity to simply be,
2880920	2881760	right?
2881760	2886760	And then to be and to have that beingness
2886800	2891160	be so fill your existence in the world.
2891160	2892320	I mean, that's a beautiful thing.
2892320	2893880	I mean, that's a beautiful thing.
2893880	2896600	And I think there's an opportunity for us to achieve that.
2896600	2897640	He certainly makes this case.
2897640	2899400	I believe this too, that we just,
2899400	2902560	we don't so, we socialize towards instrumental control
2902560	2904160	and doing, you know?
2904160	2906720	And can I do more and do more and do more and get more
2907480	2909840	and the whole, and then you can rest
2909840	2913040	and or watch your damn, you know, whatever is fun for you.
2913040	2916200	And it's like, you're missing the entire point
2916200	2918160	of being in becoming modes of, you know,
2918160	2920800	we should be working when certainly you have to
2920800	2922840	at some level, it's not like you don't do,
2922840	2926800	but the cultivation of that fundamental being in the world
2926800	2930320	and being held by the world in a moment of the infinite now
2930320	2932160	and a particular kind of presence
2932160	2934320	to be able to taste that, to be present with that.
2934400	2936640	I think that's a, I've certainly grown
2936640	2938760	in the last five years in that mode.
2938760	2940840	And, you know, even as a clinical psychologist,
2940840	2943720	we aren't socialized too much to orient to that.
2943720	2945320	I think that's a great,
2945320	2947440	many wisdom traditions do orient that way.
2947440	2950000	And I've really felt fortunate
2950000	2952440	that I've been hanging out with people over the last five years
2952440	2955080	and really shine the light on that in a rich way.
2955080	2955920	Right.
2956960	2959120	Well, one of the things that is you've been describing
2959120	2960640	all of this, it's just been,
2960760	2964880	it's a marvel to realize our pre-reflective
2964880	2969880	organismic sense knows this relationship with folding.
2971840	2974320	It's embodied, embedded, right?
2974320	2978920	There's a deep, seems super intelligent to me.
2980520	2983320	It's network of is intelligibility
2983320	2988240	that seems to somehow be oriented to this, right?
2988240	2990040	So just this idea of that,
2990080	2992000	because I've seen this over and over and over again,
2992000	2994360	where, you know, like it is, it's really true.
2994360	2998600	It's like, I think it's set up in such a way
2998600	3000600	and it says a lot to do with nihilism.
3000600	3002400	It says a lot to do with the meeting crisis,
3002400	3003240	all of this, right?
3003240	3004800	Where we're not really,
3005880	3009080	we don't even consider that we don't have
3009080	3012800	an understanding of being that isn't contingent, right?
3012800	3015000	There's not this sense of contingency,
3015000	3019480	the sense of, that there is, there are principles, right?
3019560	3023200	That in some sense govern,
3023200	3026200	you know, govern the orderliness
3026200	3029640	or make it possible for orderliness.
3029640	3032320	And in some sense, philosophy, right?
3032320	3034480	Philosophy in the deepest sense of the word
3034480	3037560	was really in some sense about getting close to
3037560	3040040	and beholding those principles, right?
3041480	3045160	That in some sense, the principle itself,
3045160	3047120	you can't, what's interesting about is,
3047120	3049160	the principle itself is like, you cannot,
3049200	3052160	it's one of those things where you cannot ultimately,
3053880	3057280	you can't put into language, right?
3057280	3059160	I think, yes, it's the way, you know,
3059160	3061560	you go to Taoism catchers, this is pretty early.
3061560	3063440	I think when they say the Tao is not the Tao,
3063440	3067120	it's a participatory, perspectival presencing
3067120	3070840	that is definitely at this animal heart,
3070840	3073000	you know, felt sense of being it.
3073000	3075720	And then, and also I think it often is,
3075720	3077240	when we have our transcendent states,
3077240	3078640	it's trans-justificatory.
3078640	3080800	So in virtually all mystic states, it's, you know,
3080800	3083440	the ego dies or dissipates that little,
3083440	3086240	the narrating regulator or seeking justification,
3086240	3088560	control and legitimacy, right?
3088560	3090120	That is crucial.
3090120	3093240	But it is a particular kind of mode
3093240	3095320	that I think our modern style is like,
3095320	3098240	way over-activated in a particular way.
3098240	3099480	Oh, totally.
3099480	3101960	And then it kind of controls the shit
3101960	3104120	and is trying to regulate and make sure everything
3104120	3106200	fits in the damn boxes that it's trying to control.
3106760	3108800	Anxious or pissed off if it doesn't, you know,
3108800	3111080	win its justification in a particular way.
3111080	3113440	And that is, that's definitely not
3114680	3117320	the coherent stacked integration.
3117320	3119240	In fact, that's just one piece of it
3119240	3121720	and you need to be underneath it and above it
3123160	3126400	rather than just trying to use it as the primary,
3126400	3128680	you know, propositional reasoning network,
3128680	3130920	which is really modernity, you know,
3130920	3133560	basically started to just said that in many ways.
3133560	3135280	It was like, wow, we're gonna reason our way
3135280	3137400	through justification and science into this.
3137400	3139920	I know Ian McGillchrist makes a number of points
3139920	3141600	in these directions and I agree.
3141600	3143480	Yeah, right.
3143480	3145960	And this sense of witnessing,
3145960	3147240	and I'm sure you've probably experienced
3147240	3151480	this being a therapist too of that.
3151480	3152560	It sounds like I would imagine
3152560	3153800	that therapy is a lot like this,
3153800	3157120	but just when you start to get real about,
3157120	3159560	people start to have these insights that,
3160560	3164080	and it's usually when their defensive strategies
3164960	3169680	don't like actually start the balance,
3169680	3172280	the benefit of that goes down, right?
3172280	3173800	Right.
3173800	3174960	Because usually I've noticed this
3174960	3177640	with like kind of psychological forms of defensiveness,
3177640	3180800	is it creates this immediate sense of safety,
3180800	3183440	but in a way that numbs you
3183440	3186280	or has you not see the long-term consequences.
3186280	3188520	And I think that thing that you were talking about,
3188520	3191240	this nemo, this emptiness inside,
3191240	3195080	in which if you fall into that, it's all over, right?
3195080	3196720	That's the felt sense.
3196720	3201280	Then you live such that you're not that,
3201280	3204400	and then you articulate a whole way of being
3204400	3206480	that's about an avoidance of that, right?
3206480	3210800	But then you're dependent on that in some weird sense.
3210800	3214680	So you go in with people and you start talking about this,
3214680	3218320	and you say, well, what would happen if you just didn't do that?
3218320	3219320	Yeah, totally.
3220200	3221960	Like in this anxiety comes up,
3221960	3224680	and then there's a way where it's like you take something
3224680	3227600	to be with the anxiety and the annihilation
3227600	3231480	because there's a deep mistake going on in there, right?
3231480	3232800	Right, exactly.
3232800	3235600	But when people can tolerate it, right,
3235600	3236840	and the conditions are right,
3236840	3239440	and they can tolerate it and they can open to it,
3239440	3243480	that and go through that initial, it's like feeling,
3243480	3247800	it's like that level of experience is so, it's so intense, right?
3247800	3252280	It's like, imagine, it's like the feeling,
3252280	3255320	it's like the most haunting, nauseating,
3256800	3259840	like everything unattractive that you could imagine
3259840	3262080	in your very pores is the recognition
3262080	3264400	that that's all that there is, that's what it feels like, right?
3264400	3267560	It's like total awfulness, right?
3267560	3269160	In the deep sense of the word,
3269160	3272360	and it takes something to even get any leverage
3272360	3274440	to be able to turn towards it, right?
3274440	3277320	Absolutely, it takes a little bit.
3277320	3280200	But when you do, there is something though,
3280200	3282920	because, and I'm kind of getting this through this conversation
3282920	3285320	in a different way,
3285320	3289600	that I don't know if I quite saw it like so congruently here,
3289600	3294600	is that we have our nervous system
3295960	3300960	is really knows how to open to that deep openness, right?
3303840	3305640	It's like something catches,
3305640	3308440	like if you can feel through that barrier, right?
3308440	3311280	And you can like, at some point, you're like,
3311280	3313880	all right, non-being, ah!
3313880	3316720	Right?
3316720	3317880	Totally, yeah.
3317880	3319160	At some point, you're like,
3320360	3323160	well, there is a lot of room.
3323160	3324360	It is kind of spacious in there.
3324360	3327120	In fact, there's like an affording spaciousness in like,
3327120	3330240	but your nervous system knows how to,
3331240	3335720	how to take in that in the most generative sense, right?
3335720	3336720	Yes.
3336720	3337720	Yeah.
3337720	3338720	If it's, yeah.
3338720	3340720	Right, it has that potential, okay?
3340720	3341720	Yeah.
3341720	3343720	It also, the reason people get all tangled up
3343720	3347240	is precisely because the way that egoic narrator
3347240	3348720	frames it all, okay?
3348720	3349720	Yeah.
3349720	3350720	If you frame it in a particular way,
3350720	3353240	and you do have a core anxiety thing,
3353240	3355240	and then you get a lot of reinforcement,
3355240	3356720	that this in structure,
3356720	3358720	because the system basically is reading this,
3359720	3362720	is that this is annihilation itself, okay?
3362720	3363720	Yeah.
3363720	3365720	And then you build all the justification around that.
3365720	3369720	And then what you, if you do it in the right way,
3369720	3372720	and afford the person to bring to bear
3372720	3374720	what that annihilation actually means,
3374720	3376720	at first it's terrifying, right?
3376720	3377720	Yeah.
3377720	3378720	But you're right.
3378720	3380720	If the opening of what this might mean
3380720	3382720	and what might be on the other side of it
3382720	3384720	is afforded to the individual,
3384720	3387720	and they can hold the egoic defenses off
3387720	3390720	or participate in a flow that don't lead
3390720	3391720	to the reciprocal narrowing
3391720	3393720	and the need to escape in safety,
3393720	3396720	but actually get present and take the step off
3396720	3399720	into sort of like what appears to be the abyss.
3399720	3400720	And then it's like, oh!
3400720	3402720	And then you're like, huh.
3402720	3403720	You know?
3403720	3408720	Here I am not meeting up my dad's standards,
3408720	3410720	and here I am not being this,
3410720	3412720	and here I am being the person that's rejected,
3412720	3415720	and here I am, and here I still am.
3415720	3418720	And here I am like so many other people,
3418720	3421720	and then here I am like living my life,
3421720	3424720	and then it's just like, and then here I am living.
3424720	3426720	And then it's like, well, isn't this fascinating
3426720	3429720	that this is all part of the drama, you know?
3429720	3431720	And then all of a sudden the relationship to this
3431720	3434720	is instead of the doer, controller, manipulator,
3434720	3437720	avoider, defender, it's just the beer, you know?
3437720	3439720	It's just sort of like, huh.
3439720	3442720	And of course that is the, that shift when I see it.
3443720	3446720	And you're like, you start noticing like, what is this am?
3446720	3447720	Yeah.
3447720	3448720	The am doesn't seem to,
3448720	3450720	if you follow me around everywhere,
3450720	3451720	what is this am, right?
3451720	3452720	There you go.
3452720	3454720	Oh, close one day.
3454720	3456720	There's the beginning of all of it.
3456720	3457720	Yeah, of the whole new vibe.
3457720	3460720	Yeah, you start to make that fundamental shift.
3460720	3461720	And then I think that, you know,
3461720	3466720	to coach people into the mode of fulfillment,
3466720	3468720	you know, what is fundamental fulfillment?
3468720	3470720	And certainly from my vantage point, you know,
3470720	3475720	it is in the now of, of, of existence in that felt sense
3475720	3479720	of beingness, being and becoming, the doing is crucial,
3479720	3481720	but it's, that's means to end shit.
3481720	3485720	This fundamentally is the eudaimonic point, you know,
3485720	3489720	that affords the particular capacity,
3489720	3491720	whether it's by some design, design,
3491720	3494720	or at least just a hell of a fortunate system
3494720	3497720	towards neg entropy that affords us what it is like to be
3497720	3500720	cohering and integrating across multiple levels.
3500720	3503720	And then to have the reflective felt sense of appreciation for
3503720	3506720	that, which to me took a little cultivation,
3506720	3508720	but is now super available.
3508720	3509720	Yeah.
3509720	3512720	And that's, that's a nice place.
3512720	3514720	I remember when you talked about, when you,
3514720	3516720	when you talked about that of,
3516720	3520720	I think part of what you mean with that is when you talk about
3520720	3521720	when wisdom energy,
3521720	3524720	would you say wisdom energy and in the way you're talking about it,
3524720	3527720	is in the way you're talking about it, is that, is that.
3527720	3530720	That felt experience.
3530720	3533720	Of all of that intelligibility coming through a, like,
3533720	3537720	you could feel it in your body from the inside out, right?
3537720	3538720	Exactly.
3538720	3540720	In a way that you.
3540720	3541720	Yes.
3541720	3545720	Yep. So it expanded my, you know, I had my framing or whatever,
3545720	3547720	but that I did reach another layer,
3547720	3551720	both above and below my justificatory narrative of expansion
3551720	3556720	and coherence integration and afforded a presencing of that.
3556720	3561720	Being this and then basically it was, I am energy.
3561720	3563720	I'm in this energy information blob.
3563720	3564720	Okay.
3564720	3567720	But it's actually the arrangement of my energy information blog
3567720	3570720	then affords a profound experience of wisdom.
3570720	3572720	And that's what I meant as wisdom energy.
3572720	3575720	It's just sort of like, yeah, you know, this,
3575720	3578720	and it feels the way, you know, it's just walking my dog.
3578720	3580720	You know, it's just, you know,
3580720	3583720	it's just the opportunity here for profound sustainability,
3583720	3585720	meaning it's like, if actually,
3585720	3588720	if I just relate to myself and the world they particular,
3588720	3590720	I don't need to, of course I need to eat a few things,
3590720	3593720	but I mean it's like the consumption and the doing and the,
3593720	3596720	you know, all of a sudden it's just sort of like, God, you know,
3596720	3599720	so I kind of know that we've really unwell balanced in this regard.
3599720	3602720	It's like, what the hell is this? Why don't I just like, you know,
3602720	3604720	I can just be in love, you know,
3604720	3606720	basically it's just being in love with existence.
3606720	3610720	It's just being in love without memory or desire, you know,
3610720	3614720	and that the ego facility sort of drops in out.
3614720	3617720	And it is a profound sense of being held.
3617720	3620720	I really do feel held by the universe.
3620720	3625720	And at one with it in a particular way in that self other just grip of the world.
3625720	3629720	And that it's a level of feeling that I think that's what I kind of,
3629720	3633720	I think I'm like reflecting back with you about this.
3633720	3635720	To the earlier part of our conversation.
3635720	3637720	Is it.
3637720	3641720	It's, it sounds like an embodied optimal grip.
3641720	3642720	Yeah.
3642720	3644720	With, with being right.
3644720	3645720	Like,
3645720	3646720	That's great.
3646720	3648720	That's, you know, being John is cognitive science.
3648720	3651720	This will tend to describe it that way. Yes.
3651720	3652720	Yeah.
3652720	3653720	In fact, in fact,
3653720	3655720	to talk to with John the other day about this about,
3655720	3658720	because he's been looking a lot more at attachment and he,
3658720	3664720	the way he described attachment, right, was.
3665720	3668720	As.
3668720	3672720	The result and demonstration of, of optimal gripping.
3672720	3673720	Right.
3673720	3676720	Of the, this whole thing about that there's, and that's,
3676720	3680720	it does make sense because it's.
3680720	3683720	We're not looking at objects, right? There's, it's,
3683720	3686720	it's dynamical relations all the way down. Right.
3686720	3689720	We're no something that's, it's, I think, in fact,
3689720	3693720	I think the mistake is often we start to relate to ourselves as a thing.
3693720	3695720	Right. That can have something. Right.
3695720	3698720	But it's really a dynamical affordance of that.
3698720	3701720	And would you say that, that, that, that you feel.
3701720	3705720	That resonance that you're talking about that embodied resonance.
3705720	3709720	It seems like your attachment systems. Right.
3709720	3713720	Our system. It's what do you feel that through the same?
3713720	3715720	I don't know if you want to call it circuitry.
3715720	3717720	That one feels.
3717720	3719720	Deeply valued.
3719720	3722720	And a parent relationship. Is it a similar.
3722720	3723720	Like.
3723720	3724720	Circus tree.
3724720	3725720	Yep. Yeah.
3725720	3726720	Well, I mean.
3726720	3727720	Yeah.
3727720	3730720	So certainly at the relational level. Yes. I mean,
3730720	3733720	I was sort of expanding beyond in terms of the entire self.
3733720	3736720	And it was, I will, as a social mammal, I'll feel it in relation.
3736720	3737720	Okay.
3737720	3740720	But so in terms of, so in terms of my attachments,
3740720	3742720	just say, let's say with myself. Okay.
3742720	3743720	Yeah.
3743720	3746720	The attachment with yourself is the internalized.
3746720	3747720	Intraject.
3747720	3749720	The interject is the ego.
3749720	3751720	Builds its model of the self.
3751720	3754720	And then build a second order justification system of.
3754720	3755720	Yeah.
3755720	3757720	I me relation.
3757720	3760720	And then starts to hold the standard of self.
3760720	3762720	Relative reflecting on the self.
3762720	3765720	The intuitive heart level and self esteem.
3765720	3768720	And self acceptance refers to the way the interject.
3768720	3769720	Treats the heart.
3770720	3773720	Okay. And that then often it's not always the parent,
3773720	3774720	the way you do it,
3774720	3777720	but to the internalized other and the normal standards are,
3777720	3780720	you've internalized the standards of society, the super ego.
3780720	3781720	So you know,
3781720	3784720	know what contingent society is going to tell you that's loved
3784720	3785720	and acceptable.
3785720	3787720	And then you judge yourself accordingly.
3787720	3790720	So you jam the shit that's not acceptable into the closet and
3790720	3792720	other people can't see it. And then you won't,
3792720	3794720	and you won't lose influence and value.
3794720	3798720	But then of course you break the structure of coherent integration
3798720	3799720	across the verticals.
3799720	3802720	Cause you're now taking a poor aspect of the self that thinks it's
3802720	3804720	an organismic value in processes like, Hey,
3804720	3806720	this is how I want to express myself.
3806720	3807720	You're like, you know,
3807720	3811720	like my friend who was gay in 1985 is like, you can't be fucking gay.
3811720	3812720	You know,
3812720	3813720	you know,
3813720	3816720	all the homophobia is like jam that shit in the closet.
3816720	3817720	And you're like, you know,
3817720	3819720	and then you had to figure out how to come out of the closet.
