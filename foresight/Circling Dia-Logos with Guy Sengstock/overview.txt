Checking Circling Dia-Logos with Guy Sengstock/＂The meek shall inherit the earth＂ Ontological Vulnerability ⧸ Gregg Henriques & Guy Sengstock.txt
 The discussion revolves around the concept of an "embodied optimal grip" on existence, which is a state where one feels deeply connected and valued, with a profound sense of being held by and in harmony with the universe. This state transcends the ego's grasp and involves a dissolution of the self-other distinction, leading to a feeling of oneness and presence.

In terms of attachment theory, this optimal grip is reflective of healthy attachment styles, where one feels securely attached not only to others but also to oneself. The internalized 'other' or 'self-other' dialogue within an individual can either be supportive and nurturing (secure attachment) or critical and dismissive (anxious or avoidant attachment).

The conversation touches on how societal norms and expectations, often embodied in the 'super ego,' can lead to self-judgment and repression of aspects of oneself that are deemed unacceptable. This repression can result in a lack of coherent integration across different parts of the self, leading to internal conflict and potentially causing individuals to suppress or hide parts of themselves that don't align with societal norms (like an individual who is gay but cannot openly express their sexuality due to social stigma).

Ultimately, the discussion emphasizes the importance of embracing all aspects of the self and achieving a harmonious balance between the internalized standards of self-acceptance and the external expectations of society. This alignment fosters a sense of wholeness and integration that contributes to psychological well-being and resilience.
