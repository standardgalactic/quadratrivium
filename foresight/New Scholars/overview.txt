Processing Overview for New Scholars

Checking New Scholars/From Process Data to Process Theory.txt
1. **Theoretical Lens vs. Paradigm**: A theoretical lens refers to the specific theories or frameworks that guide your interpretation of data, while a paradigm represents a broader worldview and approach to research, such as positivism, interpretivism, or critical theory.

2. **Differences between Theoretical Lens and Paradigm**:
   - A theoretical lens is about the specific concepts and theories you use to analyze your data. It's more focused on the content of the analysis.
   - A paradigm is a set of assumptions, beliefs, and methods that underpin how you approach research as a whole. It's broader and more foundational.

3. **Similarities between Theoretical Lens and Paradigm**:
   - Both influence your research questions, data collection methods, and interpretation of findings.
   - They both shape the way you see the world, the phenomena you're studying, and how you understand your results.

4. **Using Theoretical Lenses and Paradigms**:
   - You can switch between theoretical lenses within a single study to ask different questions and explore various aspects of the data.
   - You can also adopt different paradigms to fundamentally change the nature of your research approach, from seeking objective truth (positivism) to understanding subjective experiences (interpretivism), or critically examining power dynamics and inequities (critical theory).

5. **Combining Theoretical Lenses with Paradigms**:
   - It's possible to combine different theoretical lenses within a single study while maintaining a consistent paradigm.
   - Switching between paradigms within a study can be challenging but can offer rich insights by forcing you to ask fundamentally different research questions and interpret data in diverse ways.

6. **Practical Example**: In the context of hospital mergers, one might use a generative constructionist lens to understand how stakeholders construct reality around the decision-making process. Alternatively, one could employ a conflict paradigm to examine how decisions might lead to conflicts among different parties involved.

In summary, both theoretical lenses and research paradigms are crucial in shaping your approach to qualitative research. They guide your research design, methodology, data collection, and analysis, ultimately influencing the insights and conclusions you draw from your study. It's important to be aware of and reflect on how these choices affect your research process and outcomes.
