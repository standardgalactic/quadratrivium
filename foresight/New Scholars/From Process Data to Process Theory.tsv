0	9280	So, to get us started and to make sure that everyone is reasonably on the same page, what
9280	12560	is the process for that?
12560	21600	So, here are some definitions that come from an article that I did with Clive Smallman,
21600	25400	Harry Tsoukas and Yvonne Devane in 2013.
25480	32920	So, process thinking implies considering phenomena as in motion, as unfolding over time as becoming,
32920	39880	and process researchers seek to understand and explain the world in terms of activity,
40520	42520	temporality, and flow.
42520	44840	So, basically, we're looking at things moving.
46760	53240	And I have two images that would reflect what I've just said here.
53960	60520	They have slightly different foci in terms of what we mean by process.
60520	62520	And I'm just going to show the two images.
63080	68760	And what I'm going to talk about today really kind of applies, I think, to both of them.
68760	74760	So, the first image is this idea of process as evolving over time.
74760	81560	So, you have a phenomenon in one state, and you're interested in looking at how that phenomenon
82280	86600	evolves through events, activities, and choices.
86600	93320	And if you are adopting a process perspective, you're going to be focusing on those events,
93320	101800	activities, and choices as your data and the elements of your theory.
101800	108280	So, not talking about dependent variables and independent variables, we're talking about
108280	111720	things that happen, which are quite different.
113160	114680	So, that's the first image.
115480	124760	The second image, which is now on the screen, is this idea of process as activity and flow.
124760	131400	In other words, this process as all there is, everything is made up of processes.
131400	137560	So, this is a second image of process, and some people call this a strong process approach.
138520	144600	And I really like this quote from Russia, 1996, which kind of reflects this.
144600	148280	So, the river is not an object, but an ever-changing flow.
149320	151880	Things are made up of processes.
152520	155160	The sun is not a thing, but a flaming fire.
155160	158440	Everything in nature is a matter of process.
158440	167880	So, this second image really looks at phenomena as processes,
167880	169480	rather than looking at phenomena.
169480	170520	It's changing over time.
170520	172840	So, these are two different ways of looking at process.
174120	175320	That's just the backdrop.
176840	183640	I'm now going to look at the implications of this for methodology.
184200	191240	So, if you are taking a process perspective, you want to capture that activity and flow.
192040	197560	And so, you're going to collect data, and what are your data going to look like?
197880	206840	Well, typically, process data involves at least three different kinds of things.
206840	212840	So, the first kind of thing that you might collect is observations in vivo.
213480	216280	So, you are looking at things in real time.
216280	221240	You might be going to meetings, capturing conversations, capturing events,
221240	223800	shadowing people in the things that they do.
224360	228760	And so, part of your data is likely to be observations.
229880	238520	A second way of collecting process data is to build on people's memories and interpretations.
239160	244360	And you do this through interviews, diaries, focus groups, questionnaires,
244360	249800	all kinds of ways of getting at how people understand what is happening,
249800	253160	what has happened, and how that evolves over time.
254600	259720	And the third way is to look for artifacts.
259720	266040	So, artifacts that were created at moments in time that we can actually timestamp
266040	268120	so that we know when they happened.
268120	275720	So, things like minutes of meetings, or recently we've been using emails, reports.
277160	282360	So, all of these sources of data, and this presentation is not about data,
282440	284680	so we're not going to spend a lot of time on this.
284680	287640	But all of these sources of data are complementary.
287640	292040	They provide different strengths and weaknesses.
292040	295400	An interview has problems because of memories.
295400	297400	People don't necessarily remember.
297400	302280	But if you see something, you observe it, then that can compensate for that, and so on.
302280	305400	So, these three, I call them the big three,
308600	315880	sources of data for qualitative research more generally, and for process research more particularly,
316440	322920	we're going to be using them if we want to develop process understandings.
324920	329880	And if you think about it, if you've got all of these three sources of data,
330520	335320	got interviews from all sorts of people, you've got observations from all sorts of events,
335320	343080	you've got documents and emails, what is the result of that?
343080	346040	It's a total mess.
347880	350200	So, and it's shapeless.
351320	354280	You've got all these separate bits and pieces.
355400	358600	So, the question then is, what are we going to do with that?
358600	364760	And so, this is what this webinar is really all about, is what we do then.
367640	375480	And what we would like to do is move from that mess, the cloud of miscellaneous stuff
375480	383320	that we had collected, to something which is understandable, abstract, generalizable,
384200	391480	a theory. Some kind of theorizing is what we seek to do. So, the question is, how do we move
391480	396760	from that mess to something which is much more defined, posimonious, clear, and so on.
397800	403960	So, here's a picture of what we're trying to do. This is our challenge. We have to move from
403960	412040	something on the left, that is concrete, very specific, it's rich and it's messy,
414200	423000	to something on the right, which is abstract and novel. And the process for doing that,
423000	429960	okay, for connecting the concrete, rich and messy, and the abstract and novel,
430920	442040	it has to be credible, right? We have to couple the two, so that a reader of our work, our thesis,
442040	449880	or our article, can actually see how we've done this, that we have started from a mess,
451080	458200	we have ended up with a theory, and that the coupling, the way we have joined the two, is credible.
458520	465320	But creative slightly, because if we're not producing anything new, then why would we
465320	473080	be doing this? So, that's the challenge. And starting from that point, there are several
473080	478280	things that can go wrong. So, I'm just going to give you a little portrait of some of the things
478280	484200	that can go wrong with that, and that we're going to try and avoid. So, the first thing that can go
484200	494920	wrong is that we have wonderful concrete, rich, messy data, and beautiful abstract novel theory,
496280	504360	but we haven't properly connected the two. And so, that is a very easy mistake to make.
504920	513640	We can look at our data and be inspired vaguely about some kind of theory,
513640	521480	but we haven't shown tight connections between the two. So, that's loose coupling. That's
521480	537320	blind alley one. I need to be careful with that. So, blind alley two is that we code the data to
537320	547560	death and end up with something which actually doesn't reach beyond the data. It is just descriptive
547640	554920	and dull. And that's very easy, too. If you, in a certain sense, if you stay too close to your
554920	562760	data, this is what happens to you. You don't reach beyond it. So, you just have codes,
562760	569880	lots of codes and descriptions, and you've got tight coupling. Nobody is going to question
570760	577800	whether you have accurately reflected your data, but your data is not saying anything at this point.
578360	586760	It is just not descriptive. So, it doesn't work either. And then the third one, which is a little
586760	595560	bit more difficult to understand, my diagram isn't great. It's when you impose theory on your data.
596520	605800	So, you see some theory that you think might be relevant to your case. You draw a wonderful conceptual
605800	611240	framework beforehand, which is showing all the relationships that you think are going to be
611240	616760	there before you do your study. And then lo and behold, when you do your study, you take the
616760	625320	concepts that are in your conceptual framework, impose them on your data, and you say, oh, look,
625320	633640	I thought I would get this. Look, I got exactly what I thought. And what you've done there is you've
633640	640440	squeezed the richness out of the data. You've squeezed out everything that could give you new.
640440	645560	So, I call this circular coupling. And it's actually quite a common problem.
648040	653000	And I've seen it myself, and I got trapped in it myself. And the reason one gets trapped in it is
653000	661720	because thesis advisors naturally want students to look as if they know what they're doing before
661720	667560	they do their study. So, in their proposal, there will be this complex theoretical framework. And
667560	674120	that becomes the thing that drives the research. And if it drives the research too much, you already
674120	680440	end up with what you started with. And that will not make a strong contribution. So, those are the
680520	690680	different problems that might arise. And we're now going to talk about some of the ways that we might
690680	696680	try and do something that would lead us to the first diagram, which is
698760	708040	concrete, rich, messy data, abstract and novel theory, and credible but creative coupling, which
708040	717960	is kind of what we're trying to achieve. So, in order to talk about this, I'm going to rely a
717960	725080	lot on a paper which some of you may have read, which is my 1999 piece, which is a published
725080	731320	in the Academy of Management Review, which was titled, Strategies for Theorizing from Process
731320	742600	Data. It's now about 24 years later. Some things have changed, but I still think that
742600	748920	those ideas have value. And so, I'm going to start from those ideas and give you some thoughts about
748920	758760	my more recent ideas around that and experience around trying to use those ideas. And these are a
758840	767240	set of ideas. And so, I'm going to put them forward. I'm going to point you towards sources
767240	773240	that might help you with some of these ideas about how to do this. I'm not going to give you
773800	778600	a complete recipe. I'm going to give you these ideas. And these are things you can mix and match
778600	786600	and work with. And we'll look on do this now. And I'm going to... Let's see.
790040	801000	Okay. So, this is a list of the items that I included in the 1999 paper, which I called
801080	809720	Strategies for Theorizing from Process Data. And there were seven of them. And so, you can look at
809720	817560	them and you can sort of group them into three areas. And so, the first two that you see there,
818360	827400	I call them grounding strategies. And they were actually about coding. So, the first one,
827400	833320	grounded theory, is this idea that you're going to start with the data and you're going to build
833320	841480	your theory bottom up from the data. The second one is kind of a different way of looking at it.
841480	849880	Instead of building up your theory bottom up, you're going to take a priori known theoretical
849880	858040	lenses and fit them to the data top down. And if you do it with more than one, that enables
858040	864280	you to see which one fits best. So, I see these two as kind of opposites of one another,
865800	871080	theorizing from the bottom up, theorizing from the top down. And we're going to talk about those
871080	881880	first. The second two, I see as ways of displaying data. So, you can display data either as a story,
882440	887720	as a narrative, you can construct a narrative from your data, or you can try to draw them
889480	894920	using visual mapping. So, I see those two as kind of opposites of one another as well.
895800	907000	And then the last three are all about comparing data. And for me, comparing is really the essence of
907000	912360	this thing that drives, for me, it drives theorizing. When you're comparing two things,
912360	916280	you immediately ask yourself, why are they different? Why are they similar? What is it that
916280	923560	explains that? So, as soon as you start to compare, it really is a great stimulus for theorizing.
923560	928680	And I introduce here three different ways to compare. So, comparing cases, comparing
929560	935480	this notion of temporal decomposition or temporal bracketing, which is comparing phases,
936120	942600	and the last one, quantifying. And so, that's the kind of portrait of these seven
943160	957480	approaches that you can use to data. And of course, they are not, you don't pick one and then use it.
958200	964360	All right? You do all of these things when you are trying to theorize from process
964360	969640	stage. And it's a very iterative process and you move between them. So, I have this,
969640	976120	in my next slide, I have this diagram, which expresses that. So, on the left, you have what
976120	983720	I call the grounding strategies. In the middle, you have the organizing strategies, which are
983720	989160	useful for displaying. And on the right, you have the comparing strategies. And you can do them in
989160	997720	any order. I put the diagram from left to right, because I think there's a sort of a progression
997720	1005960	from coding to displaying to comparing, which I'm going to put coding, displaying, and comparing.
1005960	1010600	I think there's a progression. But that doesn't mean you might start at a different place.
1011560	1021800	Okay. So, let's start with coding. And so, I'm going to talk a little bit about
1022760	1031880	coding process data. And then we'll stop and take some questions and have some conversations.
1032840	1038520	And then I'll talk about the other two after that. So, let's start with coding.
1042280	1049160	So, there are these two strategies that I mentioned, grounded theory and alternate templates.
1049160	1057400	The grounded theory idea is from the bottom up. And alternate templates is taking the top down,
1057400	1064120	where theory is at top, and data at the bottom. Okay. So, let's look at grounded theory first.
1064680	1072600	So, grounded theory means building from the bottom up. So, you have no a priori framework.
1073240	1079960	And there are some classic authors that have talked about that. So, Corbin and Strauss,
1080680	1087000	Charmas, and more recently, Denny Joyer and colleagues,
1089000	1096760	Emma Hamilton, and Kevin Corley have this organizational research methods piece,
1096760	1101400	which explains how to do grounded theory. And it's become really dominant
1102200	1106280	in the field of qualitative research. And I'm an editor at the Academy of Management Journal.
1106280	1114280	And I see that, you know, one, I am an editor for all the qualitative papers. And I would say that
1114280	1122440	one paper out of two has one of Denny Joyer's diagrams. And I just want to say, before I
1122440	1127640	start talking about that, that that is not absolutely required to publish a paper.
1128680	1136360	But it is a very common approach, and it has all kinds of benefits. And grounded theory,
1137320	1146200	the tools like Atlas, TI, NPVO, MaxQDA, etc., are great for managing your coding. They don't do it
1146200	1156360	for you, but they manage it. I haven't yet got into chat GPT. And maybe there are some
1156360	1164440	opportunities there to see what chat GPT can do for you in terms of coding. That's the kind of
1164440	1169720	life on the front there. And I think there are people who have already started looking at that.
1169720	1175640	I'm not looking at that here. So that might be an issue that we might want to get to.
1176600	1184760	So I'm going to talk a little bit about the Joyer method. For those of you who haven't
1188760	1193560	seen it before, so that we can see what this method is about. So
1193880	1207240	a really great example of the Joyer method is the 2004 paper by Corleone Joyer on identity
1207240	1214200	ambiguity in administrative science quarterly. And I use this as an exemplar of the type of
1214200	1222680	bottom-up coding that dominates a lot of process research, as well as any other qualitative research.
1222760	1233560	So this method involves three types of artifacts. And the most famous one is this one.
1235800	1247160	And this is a coding approach, which is so elegant. What you can see here on the left,
1247160	1259400	the first-order concept, is how a researcher takes their original data and looks at the data in Vivo
1259400	1266680	and codes it into the first category. So there may be lots and lots of first-order codes.
1266680	1272920	You're going to have hundreds of them. You start doing that. You start coding bottom-up in Vivo.
1272920	1279560	You end up with far too many codes. But that's okay, because then you group them.
1280360	1285320	And so you come to the second-order things. And so they look at the similarities and differences.
1285320	1290600	You put them together. You group them. And then you do that the third time. And you can do it
1290600	1295640	the fourth time. You can do this any number of times you like. And what you have on the right
1295640	1302280	then is some key concepts that are going to become the essence of your theory. And so the
1302280	1312200	brilliance of this is it shows you exactly how you move, in theory, from your original messy,
1312200	1319880	concrete data to some abstract concepts. And it shows the pathway. So that's the first artifact.
1320760	1327240	And unfortunately, a lot of researchers kind of stop there. They show you the data structure and
1327240	1340600	that's it. A second artifact is actually showing the link between the two. So here this is in the
1340600	1346280	paper. It's just an example. They've got their concepts. And here you've got quotes that reflect
1346280	1352920	those concepts. So that's the second artifact. And the third artifact is taking the second order
1352920	1360360	and themes and the third order, the overarching dimensions and creating a process model with them.
1360360	1368680	So they didn't see the flow between all of the concepts in the paper. And there you can see how
1368920	1375720	Pauli and Joya have brilliantly started with a database of just a mess. They had observations,
1375720	1381320	they had documents, they had interviews, and they generated these concepts. And here is the
1381320	1388680	theoretical model at the end. So this looks wonderful, right? What you don't see in the paper,
1388680	1397720	of course, is all of the back and forth that they must have had to do to get the
1398360	1406040	to the data structure in the first place. This does not suddenly appear, right? You need to
1406040	1415160	know what you're doing. So this is much more complicated than it looks. So looking at this
1415160	1424440	approach, it's really a brilliant approach to show in an in a paper the rigor of your coupling
1424520	1432280	between the data and your theory. One of the things that have been said about it and I share
1432280	1440360	this concern is sometimes if you've got these concepts, you're glossing over, for example,
1440360	1445800	the conversations, the interactions, the interactional details, you have labeled everything
1445800	1453640	in terms of concepts, and you may be missing the temporality and the dynamics through this process.
1453640	1459960	So that can be a concern. And you could code differently, though. You could code
1461800	1470680	recently in a study, instead of coding things that people said, we coded the interaction.
1471320	1475640	And so there would be different types of interactions. So then you've got some of the
1475640	1487560	dynamics included in the in the story. So and the other thing is if this is entirely uninformed
1487560	1494760	by any other approach, my concern is that if you're just doing bottom up coding,
1495480	1504600	just starting from your data, and you think that the theory is going to kind of result from that,
1505240	1513080	you're going to run into Brian the Blind Alley, too. And Cooley and Joya do not do that because
1513080	1521480	they are theoretically informed. They're not, they're not starting their study from from total
1521480	1529720	scratch, even though so the the idea that grounded theory is from entirely bottom up is not quite
1529720	1538680	true. There are always efforts to connect to existing theory, and we should never forget that.
1538680	1547880	So just doing coding is not going to get you to an interesting bottom up coding is not necessarily
1547880	1554520	going to get you to an interesting process theory on its own. And it's very iterative,
1554520	1561320	and you have to keep going back and forth, and so on. So that's that. That's the final comment
1561320	1569160	there. So here we've just so far talked about the bottom up side. Let's now talk about the top down
1569160	1575240	approach, which is a little bit different in terms of coding. So we're going to look at
1575240	1582920	alternate templates, which is my strategy to. So the idea here, when I wrote the paper in 1999,
1582920	1593080	was this idea that you could, you could fit one I a priori theme theory to your data. But what's
1593080	1600840	probably more interesting is trying to apply more than one. Because if you do that, you will get to
1600840	1609320	see your data in different ways, you might even be able to verify which which theoretical framework
1610280	1618040	is more appropriate fits better. And doing this coding based on any priorities frame
1618040	1624200	frame can be very useful for doing that. And the classic inspiration for this is a book which I
1624200	1629560	recommend everybody read, which is by Graham Allison, and just the essence of decision.
1630920	1638360	And he's a political scientist. And he studied the Cuban missile crisis, which is an event which
1638360	1644040	I'm old enough to have lived through, although I was a child in the 1960s.
1646120	1654040	When nuclear missiles were placed in Cuba, and the United States had to decide what to do about it.
1655320	1665640	And what what Allison did is he got access to a huge amount of documentary data on this.
1666600	1671800	And analyzed it according to three different theoretical frames. And the first theoretical
1671800	1680120	frame was the rational actor model. So according to the rational actor model, countries are rational
1680120	1690840	actors. So countries consider the the alternatives they have available and pick the best one.
1691160	1699320	So the whole assumption is that the country is one one actor.
1701640	1706920	The second theory they applied to that this was to say no, no, no, countries are not actors,
1706920	1712200	countries have bureaucratic organizations that are part of them. So for example, the US has the
1712200	1718440	Pentagon, the military that are doing one thing. They have Congress that is doing something else.
1719160	1724760	They have the president who is doing something else. All of these individuals have their own
1725320	1731000	routines. All of these groups have their own routines that they know how to do. So the military
1731000	1736120	knows how to do an invasion. They know how to do a blockade. And if they're given the right stimulus,
1736120	1742200	they will execute the bureaucratic processes that they know how to do. And so the second
1742200	1749080	explanation was really a March and Simon based bureaucratic model. And then the third one was
1749080	1754440	political. So they were looking at individuals, what their individual interests were and how
1754440	1760440	those interacted. And they applied these three models to the same data and ended up with three
1760440	1766680	different stories, which they kind of argued in the first version of their paper, we should
1766680	1772920	keep separate because they enable us to see different things. These things are not wrong.
1773880	1778920	They're just lenses for looking at things. And having different lenses to look at things
1780040	1787160	is insightful. So this is this is a completely different approach because you are starting
1787800	1795080	from the theory and not from the data. This is an approach that probably, in my opinion,
1795080	1801240	we don't use enough. At least, and it's one of the reasons is it's very hard to
1802600	1810440	introduce three different theory of theoretical frames into a 40 page article. It's not possible.
1810440	1818440	But you can do it in a thesis much more easily. And that can be the basis for three different
1818440	1829800	articles. So that so this can be used more. I have an example here of a single paper where they
1830600	1840520	looked at three different frameworks. And this was an organization of science. It was by two
1840520	1846600	colleagues of mine in Montreal, Suzanne Duvara, who said that she said Maria, and yet the point
1846600	1860440	who is at McGill. And they studied the implementation of computer systems in in in hospitals. And they
1860440	1867800	considered three different theoretical models for understanding that. And the first one was that
1867800	1878200	this was a problem of people. And so that model was about how individuals cognitively related to
1878840	1883160	an information system. So if you wanted to understand if it was implemented or not,
1883160	1892360	you had to see how people found it useful or not, essentially. And it was basically a question of
1892360	1901480	whether different individuals could cognitively absorb the implications of the information system.
1901480	1907160	And so in order to code for that model, they coded by individuals, right, they had the list of
1907160	1912520	individuals, they considered the elements that are in the model. So there were four elements in the
1912520	1919560	model, they coded them systematically, and look to see how that worked. The second one is a
1920200	1925480	political model. And the theory behind that is that people will resist information systems that
1925480	1933080	take power away from them. And so, and they looked at different groups, so they looked at doctors,
1933640	1940680	they looked at, they looked at administrators, and how they were reacting to the information
1940680	1949000	systems over time, and considered whether this model might explain things. And the third model
1949000	1958360	is an organizational design model developed by Henry Menzberg. And here they were trying to consider
1958360	1965480	whether the organizational form was having a difference to the implementation process.
1965480	1972600	So they basically tested, and in this case, it was a test. It was not really different lenses to
1973560	1979640	enrich, to accumulate, to have three different explanations, but they tested the value of each
1979640	1989000	of these three models on the same data. And came to the conclusion that in the early phase of
1989000	1994920	implementation, it was one model that dominated in another phase, it was the second model that
1994920	2001480	dominated in the third phase, it was a third one. So that in the end, this enabled them to generate
2001560	2008680	a really interesting theoretical framework, which showed how the importance of different
2008680	2013800	processes evolved over time. So that's an example of how you can and do that.
2015880	2023880	And before I move on from this, I wanted also to draw attention to Andy van der Ven's work.
2023880	2033480	Unfortunately, we lost Andy van der Ven last year. But he has made a fantastic contribution to
2033480	2042760	process research. And one of his papers, which I really find at the same time, extremely stimulating,
2042760	2051000	but at the same time, I've always questioned it a little bit, is a piece of work with Marshall
2051080	2059960	Scott Poole, where he proposed four different theoretical, possible theoretical models of
2059960	2068520	process. And in terms of thinking about alternate templates, these are really, really useful.
2069720	2076920	These are classic process theories. And I'm just going to give you an illustration. And I actually
2076920	2085240	used this recently in a study with a colleague from University of Gothenburg, and we were looking at
2086280	2094120	migrant workplace integration in Sweden in organizations. They've had many, many refugees
2094680	2105080	come to Sweden and organizations and governments are struggling with how to ensure workplace
2105080	2120040	integration. It's clearly an important factor that can explain whether refugees can adapt
2120040	2130600	to a society. So van der Ven and Poole identified these four classic process models. They called a
2130600	2137400	life cycle process, a learning process, an ecological or evolutionary process, and a
2137400	2143400	dialectic process. And I have little diagrams which illustrate each so that we can just sort of see
2143400	2151400	what the kinds of frameworks might be. And these are really useful kind of heuristic ideas about
2151400	2158200	how you might consider your process data. So the first one is, it's a process that evolves over time
2158280	2166120	in a predictable way. So, you know, you're a refugee into a country, you try and get a job,
2166760	2173000	you go through certain processes of development, and at some point you reach a level of maturity
2173000	2179160	as integrating into your workplace. So this is a very linear process model, and it assumes that
2179160	2186760	there are kind of deterministic phases through which you pass. So that's one way of looking at
2187320	2195480	process. It's probably the simplest way, and many process models, the first iteration, that's what
2195480	2203960	they look like. It's maybe not the most inspiring in terms of understanding the complexities.
2203960	2210680	So that's one type of model. A second type of model is this idea of learning.
2211640	2217560	Van de Verden and Poole call it a teleological model. I like to think of it as a learning model,
2217560	2222520	because I think it's easier to understand, which is that you have an objective, and it's all about
2222520	2231800	agency. You have an objective, you form a plan, you try to execute it. If you are able to execute it,
2231800	2238520	so much the better, you continue, and if not, you change your plan. So it's a circular model,
2238520	2246440	really. I think that those of Edward Deming, it's a little bit like that. It's learning.
2246440	2251240	It's you plan, you do, you check, and you act, and then you plan, and you do, and you check and act.
2253080	2259240	So, yeah, migrants who arrive in a new country are doing learning as well,
2261880	2268200	and companies who are trying to develop processes to support workplace integration are
2268280	2274680	also doing learning. And so you could apply it to different levels. And so this is another
2275880	2284840	process model that you can consider. The ecological process model that they propose is this idea
2285720	2294200	of survival of the fittest, Darwinian processes. And so you start with variation.
2294200	2301240	So let's take innovation. You start with many, many, many different ideas for innovation,
2302360	2307880	but some of them fit better with the environment than others. And so the ones that do get selected
2307880	2313800	and the ones that don't get thrown out. Okay, here's the third one. Unfortunately,
2314680	2324200	Darwinian selection applies equally to migrants' integration processes. So there are
2324200	2330600	selection mechanisms, which mean that not all people manage to become integrated. And so the
2330600	2336520	integration is a very selective process, in fact, when you look at it carefully. But that's
2336520	2345960	is another model that can help explain what is going on. And then finally, the dialectic process.
2345960	2353480	So the whole notion of the dialectics is two systems or two sets of objectives that are in
2353480	2361160	conflict that collide. And so the driving force of a dialectic process model is contradiction.
2361720	2368680	And contradiction generates something else. What it will generate, you don't quite know.
2368680	2377080	And so this is the model that actually my colleague at Gothenburg, Bedran Omanovich and I found most
2377080	2385720	useful. And so our model is more of a dialectic model. And the idea here, we look at the socio-political
2385720	2393800	context. We look at tensions between management interests and migrant interests, which generate
2393800	2400680	different factors and patterns of integration. They generate tensions. These tensions give rise to
2401320	2411560	either transformation or perhaps reproduction, depending on the power dynamics. So a dialectic
2411560	2417000	process model is very much oriented around process dynamics. So what you see here is, you know,
2417000	2422520	four kinds of a priori ways that you might think about process. And I think that these are generative.
2424200	2428360	And the only thing I would say is, I think there are not just four.
2430360	2435640	So you could apply. There are many a priori process models out there.
2436040	2446840	Vandevan and Poole would argue that all of these are combinations of these four. But sometimes it's
2447880	2453240	interesting to consider them on their own merits. So I've always found actor network theory to be
2453240	2462600	an interesting theory. It's a process theory that might apply here as well. So the basic idea is
2463400	2470280	taking theories and trying them out is very generative in terms of process theorizing.
2472920	2480520	This is the point I make here. The only problem, and this is if you try to impose
2481080	2488680	one theory onto your data and match it, what you're doing is you're just labeling things.
2489640	2498680	And so that's why more than one or doing top down, but also doing bottom up as well is much more
2499560	2507000	likely to give you something that corresponds to our ideal portrait. The danger of imposing
2507000	2513640	one model is that you end up with the richness squeezed out. Looking at several, you can tell,
2513640	2517720	I mean, if you could look at my diagram, you could see that you would get several different
2517720	2523560	circles on there, and that might on the left, on the bubble on the left, and that might do a better
2523560	2535800	job of understanding your whole process. So again, this is not a mechanical linear exercise, and
2535800	2543000	there's a lot of value of iterating with the ground at the bottom up coding as well. And then
2543000	2550360	that sort of raises the question, how do you do this? Because you're doing bottom up, you might be
2550360	2556200	doing some top down coding as well. And I have another example here, which kind of is really
2556200	2565240	interesting. It's a paper by Kaplan and Olikowski, where I think the reviewers of the paper must have
2565240	2575400	asked them to explain that coding process. And so they've introduced this diagram in an appendix,
2575400	2581560	which explains that coding process. And their final model is the little diagram in the bottom
2581560	2590200	right of that picture. And what you see all of the circles, you know, where the circles going
2590200	2600760	around is showing how they iterated between bottom up coding of their data, going to the literature,
2600760	2607240	finding a theory that might help, and then doing coding based on the theory that they had found,
2607240	2613080	and doing this iteratively multiple times. And they're trying to describe here the exact process
2613080	2619080	that they went through to arrive at the particular theory they ended up with. So this is a really nice
2619080	2626760	illustration of what it really looks like, something of what it really looks like to engage in coding
2626760	2635400	of process data. And increasingly, actually, seeing diagrams like this appear in articles,
2635400	2641960	because people are being asked to explain, well, how did you do this? Actually, how did you take
2641960	2648520	theory that is out there, combine it with the data that you have to produce something new? And so
2648520	2655880	this is the combination, I think that is important. So I'm going to stop here
2658920	2667000	for a moment, and stop share, and see if we have
2669400	2672520	some questions. So I can see a lot.
2673320	2682440	Yes. Thank you so much, Ann, for the presentation and for all the information. It's been super
2682440	2688040	helpful. I have two questions. One is a clarifying question, and then the other one is also for
2688040	2694200	recommendation. So maybe I start with the clarification question. So you spoke about
2694200	2699480	alternate templates, and it's something that I've actually thought about quite a bit.
2699880	2707640	I'm not doing a process study, or I'm not doing a study with process data, but I do find all the
2707640	2713880	strategies you've mentioned very useful. I thought that alternate, or at least from my
2713880	2720200	perception, I feel like almost every qualitative study would at some point in time come across
2720200	2726360	alternate templates, because you do try a lot of different things to see what fits your data.
2727080	2734280	So from the back of my mind, I felt like it's kind of intuitive, but you mentioned that it's
2734280	2740200	not used often. So that made me feel like, okay, maybe I didn't understand what you meant by
2740200	2748600	alternate templates well enough. So is it really just trying different theoretical lenses to see
2748600	2755000	which one fits your data in the analysis process, or like what you displayed, where the authors
2755000	2762200	eventually in their final output also explain each of these theoretical lenses and then argue
2762200	2769880	for each one, which one qualifies as alternate templates? Yeah, so I mean, a study that would
2770840	2779240	really, I would consider to be an alternate template study would show the different templates
2780120	2784520	in their study and say, I looked at my data according to three different theories,
2784520	2789080	here's what happens when you take this one, here's what happens when you take that one,
2789080	2794600	here's what happens when you take the third one, or they could be four or that could be two. So
2794600	2800600	it provides different accounts. So if you were going to use that in a study, it would provide
2800600	2806600	different accounts. But that doesn't mean, and I was perhaps confusing about that, that doesn't mean
2806600	2814360	that a researcher might not be doing this in the background, anyway. But when it comes to
2814360	2819800	actually write the paper, that's kind of as if all of that variety might disappear, because you
2819800	2824920	have picked the one that's going to work, you don't have room to describe all the other alternatives
2824920	2835080	you look at, so you go for one. Yeah, so and the one is usually a combination of both the top
2835080	2843800	down and bottom up in practice, because you take your model, you apply it, and it doesn't quite
2843800	2851080	work. And so you enable you to introduce new things, or if you're going bottom up, you do
2851080	2855720	something, and you think, oh, yes, I found this, and then you have to look in the literature.
2856280	2861720	And you see, well, the literature also found that. So is that new? I mean, what is it I'm adding?
2861720	2867720	So it's this back and forth that's, that's important in the doing, but in the presenting,
2868360	2875160	alternate templates is very rare. Okay, okay, thank you so much for clarifying. The second question
2875720	2882200	is that, like I mentioned, I don't specifically use process data, but I do find all your strategies
2882200	2891000	quite helpful. But I realized that in qualitative, in the qualitative community as well, it's very
2891000	2899400	important who you cite on what studies. And I can imagine that citing process methods papers in a
2900360	2906920	study with variance data could be problematic, but I still haven't quite found, or maybe I haven't
2906920	2915320	recognized other resources, which talk about similar strategies for, for variance data, maybe
2915320	2921080	accept ground of theory and, yeah, accept ground of theory. So I was wondering if you have any
2921080	2929400	recommendations on, first of all, would it be right, or if it would be right, how to couch it in a
2929400	2936840	paper, if you are borrowing from a different area of qualitative methods for your approach. So if I
2936840	2943960	would want to say that I used alternate templates as recommended by Anne Langley, and then I cite
2944040	2949240	your paper, but then it's not a process study that could be problematic. So how could I couch it so
2949240	2955000	that it's, it doesn't come across as problematic? Or if I can't do that, then do you have any
2955000	2962040	recommendations on other resources to consult? I would not worry if you cited me for alternate
2962040	2967640	templates for any study. And in fact, when I, when I teach qualitative methods, I use this paper,
2967640	2975320	and many of the most, many of the strategies make sense for other kinds of qualitative data,
2975320	2981640	even if you're doing a variance study, some of them don't quite so much. So, so things like
2981640	2990200	temporal bracketing, it's all about time. So it doesn't necessarily make so much sense. And, and
2990280	2997480	so it depends. When, when I first wrote this paper, I was struggling with what to do with
2997480	3004280	process data specifically. And so I was looking for solutions to that. But in terms of resources,
3007640	3011880	I mean, I could recommend a few things. So, so there is a very recent
3012600	3022040	issue, special issue of organizational research methods. I think the title is Beyond Templates.
3023160	3034520	So, but the, the, the issue is extremely helpful in offering a range of other ways
3035080	3042280	of analyzing qualitative data. And so it, it, it really tries to get beyond the idea that
3042280	3049880	here's a recipe that you just apply. And, and tries to look for more complex ways. One of the papers
3049880	3059240	that I really find resonates with me, it talks about Brickolash, which is putting things together
3059240	3068040	that seem to be helpful. And I'm really, you know, strategies for theorizing from process data is
3068040	3074920	actually recommending some kind of Brickolash as well. But, but, but the Brickolash paper is
3074920	3080920	particularly helpful, I think, in terms of suggesting different ways. And they give examples
3080920	3086680	from their own research. But every individual is putting different things together. So it's,
3086680	3091400	it's not a recipe. It's not a recipe, but it's a very useful citation and
3093720	3097160	helpful in justifying your approach, I think, whatever you're doing.
3098280	3102120	Thank you so much, Anne. Ravi?
3103480	3108760	Yes. Thank you. Excellent presentation. Very, very, very impressive. My question is,
3108760	3117560	can you elaborate a little bit on process variants? I asked this because I think there is a missing
3117560	3126520	bridge or link between all the material that you suggested you cited to the whole body of
3126520	3133400	knowledge that's happening in operations management, where we look at process variants,
3133400	3138520	you know, we also teach in the operations management courses, tools and techniques,
3138520	3144600	like the fishbone diagram, Ishikawa diagram and so forth, to really understand how we can
3145240	3151880	manage those processes so that we can reduce variability to make the processes better,
3151880	3161160	more flexible, cheaper and faster. I think that practical call for why we try to manage processes
3161240	3167400	is conspicuously missing in what you suggested. And this is not a criticism. I'm just trying
3167400	3173320	to connect two bodies of knowledge here, what you cited and what goes on a lot in operations
3173320	3180120	management. Thank you. Yeah. So what I'm talking about is, you know, every researcher who is
3180120	3188920	interested in understanding process theoretically, I'm not talking about how to analyze a specific
3188920	3196680	process to improve it. But obviously, that is a complementary kind of an approach. And some of
3196680	3206440	the techniques that we might use to theorize might also be particularly useful for improvement as well.
3206440	3213640	So things like, and I'm going to be talking about this later, process diagrams, for example,
3214360	3223080	that look at how things are working over time and which activities are taking place.
3223800	3230600	And process diagrams can be useful to describe what is going on and to theorize from it. But
3230600	3240520	they can also be useful to pinpoint, okay, this process is kind of not efficient. There are
3240600	3251400	ways of cutting steps that might be useless. And there are ways also of improving steps so that
3252760	3256920	there's greater consistency, which is what you're talking about, eliminating variance, right?
3258120	3264280	So but I'm using the terms process and variance in a little bit of a different way and more in
3264280	3271560	terms of processes of theorizing. But I do understand that there is also a practical
3271560	3275720	application as well of these things. Anna?
3280600	3285240	Yes, hello, Professor Langley. My name is Anna Kourija. First of all, thank you for the presentation.
3285240	3291080	I've been doing ethnography research projects since three years and still ongoing until next year.
3291080	3296440	So it's about four years data of ethnographic observation and interview session. It's quite
3296440	3302120	a lot and messy, as you explained. I tried already the first round data analysis using
3302120	3308120	Joya method. But I realized, as you mentioned, I'm missing the the temporality, because I've
3308120	3314360	been studying about project management stages and how culture affects the project and performance on.
3314360	3319240	And so what I could get from Joya is just a kind of constructionist. So it's like
3319240	3324280	almost static in the way that it's just forming a certain theory, but it doesn't show
3324280	3330520	how dynamics in the project team evolve along the along the stages. So now I've been following
3330520	3335800	the one from Professor Niederman, the socio evolution theory. So like more like a process
3335800	3341880	theory looks like really like a process theory. But I believe I cannot share my screen. But the
3341880	3347240	way I did it like this, I don't know if it's correct. So first, I use the theoretical lens from
3347240	3354760	the literature. So I created a code book with my research team. I get the codes around 50 codes
3354760	3360760	or something. And I did the deductive approach of top top, top down. And then I did another round
3360760	3366920	with my team also inductive coding, so that to get some new ideas, or maybe we are not
3366920	3372680	in the right domain and so on. And then at the end, we kind of plan a map the episodes like
3372680	3377000	what happened in conflict, what happened creativity. And then we start from the project,
3377000	3382600	start with the project and and we create like couple of episodes mapping. And then we kind of show
3382600	3388440	it to the front. And I don't know if we're doing the right thing. But at the moment, this is so far
3388440	3394520	the best approach that we could think of to generate such huge amount of data. Otherwise,
3394520	3400200	I'll be also overwhelmed with analyzing this. I would like to get your insight if I'm in the
3400200	3407000	right track or should I try another approach? I mean, this sounds really good to me. I would,
3407000	3412120	you know, if you'd like to send me something that you would, you know, I'd be glad to sort of comment
3412120	3419560	on it. But thank you for doing both bottom up and top down coding. And I think that just focusing
3419560	3425640	on one can be problematic. You know, if you just do the top down, then you don't produce anything
3425640	3432840	new. If you do the bottom up, you just kind of end up being descriptive. So it's, it's,
3433720	3439960	it's the combination of both, which can give you that richness, I think. So yeah, I'd be glad to
3439960	3444920	look at what you're doing. I'm happy to do to get your feedback on the thank you so much,
3444920	3453640	Professor Langley. Okay, you see. Hi, I have a question about your strategy to alternative
3453640	3459880	templates, fit a different theoretical framework to the data. And sometimes people from different
3459880	3465560	disciplines study the same phenomenon. So the alternative templates may come from another
3465560	3471160	discipline. For example, like, in addition to management, there may be economics,
3471160	3477000	maybe astrology, maybe geography, I really like your picture in the beginning, the river is not
3477000	3485160	object, but ever changing flow. Just analogy, like the person is like driving the boat is like
3485160	3491000	an entrepreneur drive a business. And the river is kind of like community institutions, is like
3491800	3499160	economic geography that kind of thing. For example, the river is, is changing flow, like there are
3499160	3504280	a lot of economic geographers study the community institutions, but they are not considered a
3504280	3510440	management. So when I use alternative templates, when I incorporate those, to let different
3510440	3515880	disciplines to kind of have a conversation is answer your call of the river is not object,
3515880	3522360	but every changing flow, that's very juicy part because my background was from economic geography.
3523080	3528360	But I'm supposed to say this is not an internship paper, you should submit to somewhere else.
3528360	3535080	But I am targeting at management mainstream conversation, I want to join that debate. I think
3535080	3540680	some people say that because the entrepreneurship is changing like a very long time ago is like Steve
3540680	3547320	Jobs, a kind of entrepreneur, but later on come to the community's level, for example, and then
3547320	3552600	come to the social level. So what is expanding a touch of the boundaries of different disciplines,
3552600	3557800	for example, economic geography, but right now I want to speak to the mainstream entrepreneurship
3557800	3563640	literature, or join that debate, and I want to use the alternative templates by citing
3564840	3569320	the framework from different disciplines and let that to kind of have a conversation,
3569320	3575000	so that I can answer your call that the river is not just object, but the average changing flow
3575000	3580440	that's bring the community lens into the conversation, but speak to the mainstream
3580440	3585400	entrepreneur. Okay, you give me some suggestions so that people will say it never.
3585800	3592680	I think that that sounds great. I mean, I think that multidisciplinary research is difficult,
3592680	3601080	but if you are not just, if you are bringing in alternative templates that are not based
3601080	3607480	in management and comparing them with those that are, I think that's extremely generative
3607480	3614680	and it's likely to be well received. In the entrepreneurship field, I know of one paper
3614680	3623400	that really does a good job of looking at alternative templates, and that's a paper by Greg Fischer.
3625800	3631000	I think it's Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice is the journal, and it's 2012,
3631000	3637320	and it's a kind of a classic application of alternative templates approach,
3637320	3639800	so that might be something that you would want to look at.
3640760	3645400	So can you type the literature in the chat box, or I follow up and give you an email?
3646280	3655720	Yeah, maybe what I will do is send a bibliography to Ibrat at the end, if that's possible,
3655720	3662600	because there are ways to distribute that too. I think I can do that. Yeah, okay, I will create
3662600	3668440	a bibliography and send it. Wonderful, thank you. If anyone could type that paper in the chat box,
3668440	3677880	I really very appreciate it. Thank you. So we have Ibrat and Melissa. Yes.
3679880	3686040	My question is about, you talked about kind of doing bottom-up and top-down approach to working
3686040	3691400	with the data. Where do you see the role of the thick description in this, and would you say
3691400	3697240	thick description? What is the sit in between those two polarities, so to speak? Well, thick
3697240	3702200	description for me is more of a bottom-up approach, and I'm going to be talking about narrative
3703400	3713480	after, you know, next. So I think that we can get into that, and you know, its narrative is
3714360	3721560	doing a thick description as something you might do first, or something you might do
3721560	3727960	last when you have done coding. It both is possible. So anyway, we'll talk about that
3729160	3736840	in a few minutes, if that's okay. So let's have, but probably best to have one last question from
3736840	3744440	from Melissa. Thanks, Anne. I'm struggling a bit because I'm looking at transformation
3745400	3752840	comparing it with typical organizational change in that it's constant, and so looking at a strong
3752840	3759800	process theory, but at the same time looking for those constants that are in the river,
3759800	3765000	and how to sort of frame it. So I've been trying to use different lenses, like performativity,
3765000	3771960	and the transformation is a journey, but I'm getting a bit stuck between, well, the right,
3771960	3780200	really the right lens to sort of capture the, and make the theoretical contribution
3780200	3784920	to show that this is something different if we're talking, for example, in this case about
3784920	3791160	digital transformation versus sort of status quo organizational change.
3791320	3802760	So I'm not quite sure I have to respond to that, but I do think I've always thought of, you know,
3802760	3813720	transformational change as being, okay, fine, you get you shock a system with some kind of,
3814360	3817560	well, you know, one time supposedly one time
3820760	3827640	initiative, but then it kind of gets itself into woven with what is already going on
3828200	3836200	in the company or the organization, and so it becomes continuous. And so change changes,
3836200	3840760	this is the way I think about it, so that so that you have this one time transformation,
3840760	3846040	but it gets transformed, it gets changed by the continuity of ongoing change.
3848520	3856600	And so I like to have that, I like to have that kind of image where, yeah, you do a merger,
3856600	3861640	and then you don't do a merger, and then everything is, you know, then you have a result,
3861640	3866280	you do a merger, and then all of the things that were going on anyway in the enterprise
3866920	3876600	kind of change what that means. So I think that that can be done, and I think that you can trace,
3876600	3883080	you can trace, you know, the moment of change, and then trace through the ripples that it creates,
3883080	3891160	so that it may create big ripples and small ripples. And I don't know, I would tend to
3891560	3900760	look at some kind of temporal bracketing where I would see waves occurring.
3902120	3908120	We're trying to understand capacity for the transformation, and the issue is that capacity
3908120	3913400	seems to be a boundary, it is or it isn't, and yet are there certain constituent components
3913880	3921720	that enable this transformation to be possible, and is it the right theoretical lens to use
3921720	3928600	performativity if we're trying to sort of talk about, and maybe boundary condition is not even
3928600	3934280	the right term to use anymore, but, you know, the approach was to use necessary condition analysis
3934280	3939640	and the data to try to find, yeah, that doesn't even make sense.
3940600	3946040	I mean, why don't you send me an email? I have a little problem with the notion of capacity,
3946040	3953160	because it's kind of static, right? It's a thing, it conveys the idea of something that's fixed,
3953160	3960520	a capacity, or a capability, because this is something which changes over time, the capacity,
3960520	3966280	you know, you learn, so you have great capacity, and so everything is evolving, and so the notions
3966360	3972600	like capacity, feel a bit uncomfortable with, you could, when you could talk about capacity work,
3972600	3979320	which is working on the capacity, so then you get to doing again, but-
3979320	3981960	That's super helpful, thank you so much.
3983000	3991000	All right, okay, so I think we'll, we'll move on a little bit, because we don't have that much
3991000	3995160	time, so I'm going to try and perhaps accelerate a little bit here,
3997800	4006520	and I have to share my screen again, right? Okay, so we're now moving on to the middle column here,
4007160	4014760	which is displaying process data, and so I'm going to talk about two strategies that I mentioned
4014760	4021720	in my paper, which are narrative and visual mapping, and so there's two different ways of
4021720	4028600	displaying, the first one is displaying your data in terms of words, and the second one is
4029160	4040280	in terms of drawing, in terms of pictures, so if we look at narrative, this is so easy,
4040280	4046520	just tell the story, just write it up, you know, all you have to do is to write the story, and
4046520	4053320	there are classics here, Alfred Chandler, for example, historian tells a narrative,
4053320	4059880	his theorizing is very much narrative-based, and as Ibrat mentioned, thick description
4060520	4071000	from anthropology is a term that Geertz uses to, to talk about his approach as thick description,
4071000	4078360	and if you do these things well, so basically what you're doing is you're taking the mess of
4078360	4085720	data that you have, bringing them together to create a narrative, and a narrative that will
4086280	4094200	hopefully tell you something about the world that reaches beyond the particular case,
4094920	4101000	and so narrative can be very powerful, and if it works, you get a sense of this,
4102200	4108520	I've seen this before, so a really good narrative study,
4108680	4115640	it'll be like a really good novel, because you will see, okay, this makes sense, this is,
4115640	4123720	this is how the world is, and so it can be really appealing to have a strong narrative,
4125800	4135000	and then I really like this quote from John Van Lennon, who argues in favor of narrative,
4135000	4140760	because precisely because narrative allows for complexity and ambiguity,
4141880	4151400	and if your case that you have is fuzzy and messy and ambiguous, then if you want to render it
4153000	4161160	and keep that side of it, then, you know, he says to be determined, we must be indeterminate,
4161160	4165400	because things are confusing, because things are messy, and so on and so forth,
4166360	4172280	so a narrative approach tends to try and keep as much of the richness as possible,
4172280	4180360	but at the same time, give you that sense of deja vu, so that's the positive side,
4181160	4188280	this is the negative side, and so this is Laurel Richardson in the handbook of quality
4188360	4193080	research, and she says, I have a confession to make for 30 years, I have worked my way through
4193080	4201880	numerous supposedly exemplary qualitative studies, and it's boring, basically it can be so boring,
4201880	4207720	and the reason is that it's just descriptive sometimes, and so it's blind alley two again,
4209080	4216120	where you have so closely captured your empirical data that we can't see
4216920	4223240	the deja vu, we can't see the plot within it, and so this is the problem of narrative,
4224280	4230200	but at the same time, there's almost no qualitative study where you don't at some
4230200	4239720	point draw on narrative, so what are some of the other ways to draw on narrative, so one way is
4239720	4249160	to use it as the first step, so you have all this mess, why not just try and write it up
4250600	4256760	as completely as possible, and this Kathleen Eisenhardt, this is the step that she always
4256760	4262120	recommends, and she talks about multiple case studies, and she talks about how for each of her
4262200	4271480	cases, she writes something like a 70-page, single-spaced story, and that story becomes
4271480	4281880	like a secondary database for the rest, it's a way just to get started, and it becomes,
4281880	4288600	as we're writing this narrative, it becomes the stimulus for your coding that you're going to be
4288600	4295800	developing, so that can be one way to use it, the other way to use it is to consider it as your
4295800	4303960	last, you write the narrative to integrate your coding and your data and your theory, to bring
4303960	4308680	the data and theory together so that you're telling a story which has concepts in it,
4309320	4325720	and is kind of bringing codes and specifics and generality together, so a really strong narrative
4325720	4336520	as a last step is going to be able to take specifics and show how they reflect a more theoretical
4336520	4340040	concept, and you might consider multiple narratives which is getting back to the
4340600	4347320	alternate templates approach, or you could look at multiple narratives based on the visions of
4347320	4351960	different people in your case, that's another way to multiple narratives, so these are richer ways
4352600	4360280	and more useful ways I think of thinking of narrative, and there's this paradox about narrative
4360280	4366840	which is you can't write a really good narrative until you know what the plot is,
4368200	4377880	but you can't discover the plot until you've done the narrative, so it's this hermeneutic thing,
4377880	4385080	it's this iteration once again, you start writing, you don't have the plot at first,
4385960	4393160	when you discover the plot you have to rewrite it completely, and so it's a kind of a little
4393160	4400920	bit of a paradox, and now so that we've talked about narrative, I'm not going to talk about
4400920	4411480	another way which I really like of displaying qualitative and processed data, and this is
4411480	4420280	visual mapping, and so draw it, draw your data, or draw something, draw your theory,
4421640	4431400	and so we're talking about graphs, tables, drawings, diagrams, on visual mapping the gurus
4431400	4438200	here are Miles and Huberman and Sal Danyan, the most recent version of their book has a third
4438280	4445480	author, so Miles and Huberman, you should read this, it's a really useful book which
4445480	4451880	offers a variety of ways of drawing data, and I like it a lot.
4457400	4464920	So here's an example, no it isn't an example, okay so what is visual mapping? So visual mapping,
4464920	4470760	you can use any kinds of forms of drawing that you want, but there are a certain number of
4470760	4478440	conventions which you might want to keep to, so boxes and arrows are obviously important
4479400	4488120	aspects of drawing data, but you can use boxes and arrows for different kinds of things, so boxes
4488120	4494200	can be things, they can be objects, they can be concepts, they can be actors, they can be events,
4495160	4501880	depending on the shape of the box, you can code whether your event is for example a decision,
4502600	4512120	or if it's an event that just happened externally, so you can use the forms of boxes to indicate
4512120	4518680	different things, arrows can indicate different things, so particularly for process research
4518680	4526120	we're going to be using arrows not so much for causality probably, but more for temporal relations
4526120	4533320	like precedence, what comes before what in time is something that we're going to be using
4534120	4542920	with arrows, we're showing with arrows, we can use icons, emoticons, etc, and there are a certain
4542920	4551960	number of conventions, so at least in the west time goes from left to right, it does not necessarily
4551960	4562840	go from left to right in other parts of the world, and that can be confusing, so if your writing starts
4562840	4567160	from right to left you may think of time as going from right to left, and that can be confusing,
4567880	4572920	most of the American journals will expect time to go from left to right,
4576440	4583320	hierarchy top to bottom, you can do things with overlapping boxes, you can do things
4584280	4592200	with boxes that interact, lines that interact, and so on, so there are all kinds of ways of doing that,
4593160	4604280	here is some of the thoughts of how you can use visualizations, so here's my diagram with data
4604280	4616120	and theory and coupling, you can use diagramming visualizing all along this chain, so when you
4616120	4625080	look at a published paper what you usually see is a diagram, a process theory, so that is not what
4625080	4630520	the author necessarily started with, that's the distillation of their theoretical ideas, so that's
4631160	4636520	they're using it for conceptualizing or communicating their theory, but you can also use
4636520	4644680	visualization for actually mapping your data, not just simply presenting the findings or
4644760	4651400	presenting the theory, but also for mapping the data and for analyzing the data themselves,
4651400	4660040	so it becomes a coding tool essentially, and this is an example that I put in a paper,
4660680	4670360	very old paper that I wrote with a student, it's a flow chart, and this we were actually
4670360	4677880	mapping the data, it was a technology adoption process, we classified events according to
4678840	4683720	different domains of the company, so the top to bottom, they're different domains of the company,
4684760	4693480	we identified different codes for events outside the company, those are the ovals
4694200	4703880	for activities which were I believe square boxes and decisions which were the round cornered ones,
4703880	4711400	and we showed precedence, we showed interruptions, we showed events that impacted other events,
4712120	4718200	and depending on to what degree they impacted them, we placed different symbols on there,
4718840	4724280	this is an example of how you can take some data and instead of just coding it according to Joya
4724280	4734440	method, you can display it along a timeline with events, and so this is quite a different way
4735160	4742440	of coding, and it's still coding because we have coded the different kinds of events,
4743400	4753160	and this is a tool for describing your data, but then if you wanted to compare different
4753160	4757480	timelines, and this is what we did, we had five processes that we mapped this way,
4758040	4762440	we could compare them so we could see what comes before what, what tends to come before what,
4764680	4770600	can we see some patterns in the types of interactions between different kinds of
4770680	4778600	phenomena over time, so this is a really interesting tool for process research, and most cases you
4778600	4786440	never see, you don't see the mapping itself in a published paper, but you see the final, the final
4786440	4798520	diagram, so that's just looking at the time, I'm going to skip a few things here, because I want
4798680	4805160	to talk a little bit about comparing as well, so we've talked about the two methods for displaying,
4807560	4817480	comparing for me is a really powerful tool for theorizing, because it makes you,
4818280	4823640	it makes you theorize, if you, if you have an example I always give is if you have children
4824520	4832360	and you have a little boy and a little girl, you immediately stop theorize about the differences
4832360	4842840	that come from time, your, your, it's, we are programmed to theorize from empirical differences
4842840	4849640	and similarities that we see, and so it is really powerful to do that, and you can compare in all
4849640	4856680	kinds of ways, and so I talk about comparing time periods, and this is particularly useful for process
4856680	4867400	data, but you can also compare cases, you can compare incidents, and drawing tables that show
4867400	4875640	these comparisons is a great way to kind of focus, get yourself to focus on that, so
4879320	4883320	I'm just going to give, I'm going to skip this, and just give an example of some temporal
4883320	4889640	bracketing, which is decomposing by time period, so this is a paper that I wrote
4890600	4898520	with with Jean-Louis Denis and some other co-authors, and it's about a merger of three hospitals,
4900120	4906920	and they were in a double mind, they had a real tension, because on the one hand
4908520	4913080	they had been told that they would get a lot of money if they agreed to merge,
4914680	4917160	and on the other hand they hated each other,
4920600	4926360	and so they couldn't agree about anything, they had to stay together, they were stuck,
4926360	4929560	so they had this initial condition of constraint, they had to be together,
4930120	4935800	but they couldn't agree, and so how were they going to work out how they were going to do this
4935800	4947160	merger, and we showed that they kept making decisions that embedded ambiguity so that
4947160	4954920	they would need to make the decision all over again, and the processes were that okay,
4956120	4960920	they would put forward a proposal where they would try and integrate everybody into the decision,
4961480	4966760	and in order to do that they would have to make it ambiguous, which meant that they could not
4966760	4971560	implement the decision because it was ambiguous, so they would have to decide all over again,
4972440	4979960	and so this is the overall model, but we followed it through empirically with three
4979960	4986520	different stages, so here are the three different stages, so this is temporal bracketing, what we
4986520	4992760	showed was they went through a process, it produced ambiguity, therefore we had to start
4992760	4997400	all over again, and so this is a kind of a temporal bracketing of a process over time,
4997400	5003720	and this was very helpful in helping us to understand this process, and the title of the
5003720	5010040	paper is escalating indecision, this is what happens when you need to work together, but you
5010040	5020840	hate each other, you find yourself in this escalating indecision cycle, the good news is that about
5021560	5026920	five or so years after we finished our study, they did actually do something,
5028840	5033000	so it didn't, but this was the process that we observed,
5036520	5044280	and then you can also compare cases, so you can do it, compare outcomes,
5045240	5051640	and if you're doing that you're probably more into explaining variants than looking at process,
5051640	5058600	so that's one thing, but you can also use a comparison between cases to show similarity
5059320	5065560	rather than difference across different settings, and if you do that then you're demonstrating
5065560	5072760	that the process that you're looking at is not just in one case but several, and so that can be
5072760	5081400	helpful as well, you can use comparing cases to show variety, you can illustrate richness around
5081400	5091400	a similar structure, and you can combine process and variants also, so there are authors who use
5091400	5099240	multiple cases to show different processes, but then they they compare the processes and show
5099240	5104040	that some tend to lead to positive outcomes and others tend to lead to negative ones, so they're
5104040	5114920	combining process with variants, so I'm looking at the time here and I'm going to just skip things
5114920	5123000	and move on to my last point which I think is important, because I have all these strategies,
5123000	5135000	but at some point that's not enough, and I think it's a really important point that theoretical
5135000	5142440	insight does not just emerge, so when you read a qualitative paper that at some point somebody
5142440	5153640	always says the theory emerged or the concepts emerged from the data, well yes, no, I mean
5153640	5162040	you did this work, and then there's this step which you cannot, you cannot know exactly what
5162040	5170280	happened but you saw something, and it's that step that's missing from any of the strategies
5170280	5176680	that I've mentioned so far, I called this the conceptual leap, and I wrote a paper on this
5176680	5189240	with Malvina Klag, and this is an image in the paper where we point out that making the conceptual
5189240	5199000	leap is yes about analyzing your data carefully, about using all of these a priori theories to
5199000	5205400	look at your data, about talking to your friends, it's all about doing systematic, disciplined
5205400	5212840	things, but it's also about doing unsystematic, undisciplined things like going for a walk in
5212840	5221480	the park, going for a run, sleeping, sleeping is excellent when you wake up or you're turning
5221480	5228200	over in the middle of the night, that's when you get good ideas, so it's a combination.
5229240	5234040	The discipline is really important, and what we've spoken about most today is the discipline,
5234040	5239720	but there's also this kind of creative side, and if you don't have that, you won't get
5241560	5244760	what we're trying to achieve, so you need this.
5246920	5255720	So I'm going to stop there, see we still have 200 people, so I think we might be able to have a
5256280	5258600	couple of questions at this point.
5262600	5263640	Yes, Alba.
5267480	5273000	Thank you so much, Anne, this has been very, very informative, I'm really grateful, and I guess
5273000	5278120	we're all really grateful as well. Just one question on the very last point you mentioned,
5278200	5290120	which is the creative leap, so I remember writing in one paper about having a creative leap as well,
5290120	5295800	but I don't know if it's the way I framed it, but then I got back from the reviewer that even
5295800	5302440	though it's a creative leap, I should be able to explain how I got there, and that was a bit
5302440	5307960	counterintuitive because that's the point, I can't necessarily explain exactly how I got there,
5307960	5313480	which is why it's a creative leap. So do you have any pointers on how to really
5314440	5319320	couch it so that it doesn't sound like it came out of nowhere, but then at the same time,
5319320	5326920	you don't also try to force fit anything, but then you can show that, yes, it came from knowing
5326920	5332280	my data and all of that, but the direct link that you want to see, I can't necessarily show you.
5333240	5338280	No, I think what is important to show in a paper is the coupling.
5340680	5347080	So the way you found that coupling that you can't explain, but you can show the coupling,
5348040	5354520	and that is you must show that the data, if you look at them carefully, you can see the link
5355080	5361400	with the theory. So if you can show that link, that's the important thing. You don't have to
5361480	5368040	tell them how you actually got there, but if, or you can mention that you had a creative leap,
5368040	5372600	but at the same time in the same paper, you have to be able to show that coupling happening,
5372600	5378840	so that it's tied up with a bone, so that the reader can see that the data, yes, is a good
5378840	5384840	explanation, or the theory is, yes, a good explanation for the data, and the data do justify
5385400	5388440	the theory that you're proposing. So it's the coupling that's important.
5389080	5392840	Okay, okay, thank you so much. Yeah, so you get your creative leap, and then you go back,
5392840	5396120	you mustn't stop with your creative leap, you have to go back and check it out.
5397000	5401640	Otherwise, you can go wrong as well. Fardy? Yeah.
5405560	5406120	Fardy?
5406760	5412440	No, thank you very much, Prof. Really, really interesting and useful presentations, and I find
5412440	5420040	them really very, very relevant to my work, because I've been doing quantitative work until
5421320	5427640	the PhD had to do process research. One of the things that I'm really keen to do is to
5428520	5435240	really make the best decision on which particular vehicle I use to write,
5435960	5443720	you know, because I'm using data from several sources over time on how a form of behavior
5443720	5450280	continued to take different shapes, you know, in an industry that is trying to be formalized,
5450280	5458440	but then a lot of the informal activity kept on happening over time. So the dialectic
5459400	5469800	one seemed quite interesting, but my question is, is there like, would you recommend picking a model
5469800	5482440	and then trying to write after that model, or how best? The question I think you're asking is,
5482440	5492920	where do I start, you know, what does I do first? I think that I would, I tend to start with temporal
5492920	5502600	bracketing, because I sort of like to see in the data, what is it, you know, are there turning points?
5505320	5509560	And then once I've seen that, if there are no turning points, well, then that doesn't really
5509560	5519000	work. Maybe that was kind of a smooth continuity. But if there are any turning points, or, you know,
5519000	5525320	whether something happened, like some new people came in, or a new company appeared in your industry,
5525320	5531960	or something that changed significantly, more significantly than other events,
5532920	5541480	had a potential for change, then those turning points are kind of like a starting point for
5543720	5550600	looking at the data. Then you might move towards more detailed coding of what was going on in each
5550600	5555640	period. And so you would collect together bits of data, which are relevant to each period,
5556360	5564760	and start working on what's going on, what different actors were doing during those periods.
5564760	5573080	So, I mean, that's, I think what I would do, but yeah, it depends. I think you have to find
5573080	5582280	something where you kind of have something to grab onto. Another approach is to find another
5582280	5588920	basis for comparison in your data. So do you want to compare certain types of firms with
5588920	5595960	certain other types of firms? You know, if so, can you subdivide your data according to different
5595960	5601480	types of firms? Or can you subdivide it in some other way? I think it's very useful to find something
5601480	5607720	to grab onto, which you can compare with another thing. I tend to go for temporal brackets, because
5608680	5612280	I'm a lot closer. Daniel.
5614280	5620040	Hi, Anne. Thanks for a great session. This is a question that came from one of our participants,
5620040	5629480	Eva Maria Spreitzer. And her question is, what would you say or what kinds of theories are great
5629480	5636520	to inform the coding of the data, such as different levels, depths, etc. And the thinking is
5637320	5643880	because it is easy to go from low or tight with concepts or too high or too broad with
5643880	5653160	theoretical frameworks or meta theories? Yeah, well, I mean, it depends on the nature of your data.
5653160	5662600	But, you know, as I mentioned, you can you can code your data with no a priori theory,
5662600	5670840	you can just read it and see what you see. That that's the theory behind grounded coding.
5670840	5678840	But if you want to, if you want to develop more oriented coding,
5681320	5686840	I mean, think about what it is, what are some of the the concepts that you're interested in. So,
5687240	5696440	so if you want to really focus on processes, maybe your coding should be about activities,
5696440	5701640	right? So what activities are people thinking about? So that would be one
5702680	5710280	angle to look at. So process, process theory is about activities. So can we code activities?
5711240	5715960	But you might be interested in something else, you might be interested in emotions,
5715960	5722040	for example. So then you might code emotions, and then you might ask yourself, well, what
5722040	5728040	emotions are associated with which activities and which events? So, so that then you would code those.
5729640	5734200	So, I mean, this is a this is a decision, depending on the on the research questions
5734200	5740120	you're interested in. But, but if you're interested in process, I think, I think
5740200	5746120	activities, I think events would be things to focus on. I don't know if that's helpful.
5748200	5752200	For me, it is. I hope Eva Maria likes the answer also. Thank you.
5754200	5754760	Rosala.
5756120	5763720	Hi, thank you very much. So my question is about this combining a grounded theory approach with
5763720	5769720	the a priori approach. And I was reflecting on on this from a more
5770840	5776280	based homological point of view. So as far as understood, one would be more interpreted and
5776280	5782600	the other would be kind of more positivist. And I and I, I still struggle to see how can we do that
5782600	5788600	and how we can combine both. And I don't know, maybe I didn't get it right. Or maybe you have
5788600	5794200	some insight for me. Thank you. Yeah, but I mean, some some theories are interpretive. So I don't
5794200	5802600	think it necessarily, you know, means that one is one is more interpretive and the other is
5802600	5808360	more positivist. But, you know, there is this idea of induction and deduction.
5810040	5816440	But I think that what you need to understand is that even if you are doing an interpretive bottom
5816440	5825720	up constructivist approach, you need to connect it to in order to make a contribution, you need
5825720	5834120	to connect it to some a priori theorizing. So if you read carefully, even Denny Joyer's
5835240	5841000	papers, they are not a theoretical from the start, he reviews, he reviews the literature,
5841000	5848920	he comes up with a research question. And his work, his work done with other colleagues
5848920	5854280	is cumulative, actually, he's interested in identity or has been interested very much in
5854280	5858680	identity. And if you look at each of his papers, they kind of build on each other in many, very,
5858680	5869080	very, very many ways. And so they're not, they're not a theoretical. And so I think you always need
5869080	5879640	to refer back to other literature. Yeah. But you need to find your sources that fit with what
5880440	5889560	you're doing. I think a really interesting body of work, which really shows this kind of bottom
5889560	5899000	up top down idea is the body of work on organizational routines, the theory of routine
5899000	5905400	dynamics. And so this is always, the studies are almost always qualitative. The notion of routine
5905400	5914280	dynamics was developed by Feldman and Pentland. They wrote a very famous 2003 article in
5914360	5921800	administrative science quarterly. Other people interested in routine since that time have built
5921800	5928760	on that paper and their theory, but each one is making a very distinctive contribution.
5930440	5939320	And it's qualitative and it's processual. But the research questions are different, except there
5939400	5945800	are some concepts, foundational concepts that everybody is using, that just simply get
5945800	5954440	more richer and further elaborated each time. So that might be a good body of work to sort of
5955080	5964840	situate this kind of top down bottom up idea against. Thank you very much. If could I add
5964920	5973480	a second question? Yes, okay. It's actually more on the practice on the on the coding and analysis
5973480	5980120	side. So as a PhD student, I also find sometimes a bit overwhelming to look at different cases at
5980120	5987880	the same time. And so I was trying to playing around with different approaches. And I was wondering
5987880	5992680	if you have any suggestion to maybe start from one case or actually know it's much better to
5992680	5996600	look directly through all of them. And what's your opinion on that? Thank you.
5999400	6006520	Yeah, I don't know. I think it depends a little bit on whether you want to explain each case
6006520	6013880	individually and maybe think of them as separate contributions or whether the comparison is really
6014520	6020360	critically important to you. And then you want to keep it keep it going. But I mean, another
6021320	6026440	I think Daniel asked this question, you know, no, it was someone else who asked the question,
6026440	6031160	where do you start? And I said temple bracketing and another another way to start is just to
6031160	6037560	write these narratives for each of your cases. That's that's so helpful. If you have different
6037560	6046680	cases, write the narrative, put quotes everywhere. In the narrative, you know, let's let's just tell
6046680	6050840	the story. And, you know, all the quotes that you think are so great that you absolutely need to
6050840	6056520	use them, you put them in the narrative. And then you've got this kind of secondary database where
6056520	6065000	you can compare the narratives. And so that becomes then you can write new tables that compare the
6065000	6072120	narratives. So you can look case one, case two, the first phase, the second phase, and then it
6072120	6076120	becomes organized. But narrative can be a great way to get started as well.
6079560	6085400	Loreto. Hi, thanks, Anne. It's a really brilliant presentation. I'm really going to help with my
6085400	6090520	my projects that I'm doing at the moment. So thank you. And I'm my questions more about the
6090520	6097080	endpoint and about where where to get published and where you think are kind of the journals that
6097080	6106520	are more aligned to process research. Thank you. Well, it depends what your field is. I'm in the
6106520	6118280	field of management. So the the North American management journals, like Academy of Management
6118280	6125800	Journal and Admirative Science Quarterly and Organization Science, have they published all
6125800	6129880	kinds of research, they published quantitative and qualitative research.
6132120	6138440	And they have editors who are dedicated to qualitative research. So I am an editor at
6138440	6144040	Academy of Management Journal, and I am dedicated to qualitative research. And we have five,
6144680	6152520	we're a team of five editors that consider qualitative research. And it would be the
6152520	6158520	same in the other journals I mentioned. And so although they published a lot of quantitative
6158520	6162920	research, they also published much a great deal of qualitative research. So that that's a good
6163480	6171640	place to go. Many of the European type journals are more qualitative oriented than the North
6171640	6179240	American ones. So organization studies is a great journal, journal management studies are
6179240	6185400	great journals for this work. I'm not sure that I think what in order to decide which kind of
6185400	6194200	journal you want to publish in, it's a good idea just to read, you know, those journals and see
6194200	6202760	where you see things that that correspond to your interests, and that you think that you can relate
6202760	6211640	to. So some journals have more of a sociological flavor, and they may relate more to sociological
6211640	6217400	literatures, some are more managerially oriented. And there are delicate differences that you need
6217400	6223720	to kind of get familiar with. And it's very difficult to pick one. But all the journals I
6223720	6233320	mentioned, and others as well, are very open to process research. Yeah, you might if I mentioned
6233320	6239160	some that probably less so, I mean, in general applied psychology might not be so open to it,
6239160	6247160	I don't know. Yeah. Some I interrupted somebody, Patrick.
6247160	6256280	Yeah. Thank you very much for your very, very brilliant presentation. I have a pretty basic
6256280	6265320	question that has been very, very confusing for me, which is, how do you do process to arrive in
6265320	6276760	from a one of interview, where the respondent is talking about how they make decisions within
6276760	6284360	the organization. Clearly, this person is talking about a process, right, and how they
6284360	6292520	finally arrive at a conclusive decision. But this is a one of kind of interview. So how do you
6292760	6299960	do process to arrive in from such a data? Well, I don't think you can. I mean, because you only
6299960	6307800	have one person, but you can you can represent that person's theory of decision making.
6309240	6315400	So so you could. And if you have several different people, you can look at their theories of
6315480	6322760	decision making so that that they are they are suggesting the stages that you go through and
6322760	6328200	things like that. What I think, you know, when you're looking at an interview,
6329560	6341240	is that there are two ways to develop theory from an interview friend, kind of data. One is to
6341880	6348920	take the generalizations that the person is telling you. So let's say the person says, oh,
6349880	6357720	we always make decisions in. We have a committee, and we make the decisions in the committee.
6358600	6364440	Okay, so you could read that and think, okay, they make decisions in the committee. So I'm
6365240	6370680	generalizing from the generalization of the. Responder.
6372760	6379240	Or instead of doing that, and I think that this is much better, is that you have the
6379240	6387480	accounts of that individual of several specific decisions. So this happened, this happened,
6387480	6392280	this happened, this happened, this happened. The second decision, this happened, this happened,
6392280	6396360	this happened, this happened, this happened, this third decision, this get them to talk about
6396360	6404680	lots of different decisions. Then real months, concrete months, then you generalize from their
6404680	6411960	stories, not from their generalization. See what I mean? It makes a huge difference. So if you,
6412600	6422200	if you're talking, if you're using an interview, get the stories. And sometimes you do generalize
6422520	6429080	from other people's generalizations, but it's much better to get, get as close as you possibly can
6429720	6437720	to the actual events and the accounts of the actual events. And you're getting deeper when
6437720	6444440	you're doing that. I don't know if that's, that's helpful. Thank you very much. That was very, very
6444520	6453560	helpful. So how are we doing? Anyone?
6460920	6463880	I'm just looking, is there something in the chat which I should respond to?
6465560	6470600	Underworld questions. Isidora. I'm not sure we'll have time for that. Yeah, Isidora.
6471560	6479080	Hi. Thank you for a great presentation today. I believe this is a very broad question, but if
6479080	6485240	you can just give us sort of just your general opinion, I'm really interested about quantification
6485240	6492360	of qualitative data. I have thought about it in one of my previous research, but I opted against
6492360	6498440	it because of all the division of whether this is a right research strategy. So I just wanted
6498440	6504440	to hear your opinion on it and maybe if you can suggest some kind of resource that would be valuable
6504440	6510840	in sort of providing a starting point for that. Yeah, so thank you for the question because one
6510840	6516200	of my strategies was quantification and I didn't talk about it. And I didn't talk about it because
6516200	6524920	I'm not particularly fond of it. But I do think quantification can be useful. And when is it
6524920	6532360	useful? It is useful. It's not useful in the description. It doesn't, it doesn't make any,
6532360	6537400	you don't need to count anything if you just want to describe phenomena or or
6537400	6543560	types of events that happen. You don't need it. Where you do need it is where you want to say,
6543560	6552440	okay, say is more of a success than case B or some kind of way of judging differences
6553240	6564040	that is along a scale. Then you have to find ways to do it. And so, for example, I recently did a
6564040	6573320	study with a colleague, which was about, it was an 18 year history. So it's kind of a process
6573320	6584040	study of how managers cited their founders in their discourse in their communications.
6584040	6590600	And we wanted to show that the way they cited them changed over time. And in order to do that,
6590600	6597880	we had to count them. We had to code them into categories and count them to be able to demonstrate
6597880	6601960	to the reader that it's actually true that we were saying they were more like this than they
6601960	6610680	used to be. And so, counting gets important them. And when you're counting, you know,
6610680	6617560	enter, rate, or reliability starts to get important because the precision is important.
6618280	6625480	So then you need to go to resources that can talk to you about, you know, very
6626360	6633480	content analysis type coding where you have categories, and you need to be able to show
6633480	6644040	that these categories are reliable, valid, and so on. So I would look, you know, on the, on Google,
6644040	6650760	I would Google content analysis, probably Krippendorf would be a good author for that,
6651480	6658600	talking about how you would take qualitative data and then use it to quantify certain concepts.
6658600	6664280	But I wouldn't do it unless you really need that comparison. A is bigger than B.
6666280	6674040	Otherwise, one of the reasons I don't like it is you take out all the ambiguity. You take,
6674600	6680040	if you put things into categories and count them, all of the richness of your data kind of
6680040	6688200	disappears. It just has to go because the obligation to be able to find exactly the same
6688200	6694760	number as your colleague means that you have to make things so clear that there is no possible
6694760	6700440	doubt that you have categorized correctly, which means that all of the ambiguity and fluffiness
6700440	6709480	and richness goes. And that's not good. Qualitative data is qualitative. It's not quantitative.
6709480	6716840	So it's a good thing if you need to do that comparison. But if you don't, don't do it,
6716840	6724040	just to do it. It's not worth it. Okay. Yeah, thank you so much. Yeah, I think I
6724040	6731000	should have decided against it simply because the essence and the nuance within each of the,
6731000	6736040	you know, qualitative aspects sort of gets lost. But I still think that it might have been an
6736040	6743560	interesting strategy to show intensity of a certain outcome. Exactly. That's what I think.
6744360	6749720	One person who does it very well and still keeps the richness is Stephen Barley. So if you look
6749720	6755080	at many of Stephen Barley's papers, he's real. He's a fantastic qualitative researcher, but he
6755080	6764280	also counts things. And as a great paper recently in Academy of Management Discoveries about buying
6764280	6774200	cars. But he does a lot of qualitative analysis, but also does counts. So that might be a good example.
6775400	6778440	Okay. Thank you so much. Burak.
6781720	6788600	Thank you very much. I have a brief question. It's about the lens. You mentioned about the theoretical
6788600	6795560	lens. How about the paradigm as the lens? And combined with the theoretical lens, would you
6795560	6804920	please elaborate differences and similarities? How do we use them? Thank you. So you're referring
6804920	6812680	to whether you're having a critical paradigm or you're adopting a interpretive paradigm or a
6812680	6823400	positivist paradigm. Yeah. So I'm agnostic as to which one you might want to adopt. And it's also
6823400	6829800	possible to play with them. So you can pretend, you know, you can say, okay, today I'm a positivist.
6829800	6836280	If I were a positivist, how would I consider these data? Now I'm a critical theorist. How would I
6836280	6845480	consider those data? So you can do that. And it certainly would help you see, it would get you
6845480	6852360	to ask different questions about the data. So if you're a positivist, you're going to be asking,
6852360	6863160	what is the truth? Right. And if you're an interpretive, it's how are people seeing things.
6863160	6867800	And if you're a critical theorist, you would ask yourself, well, who is winning and who is losing
6867800	6877400	in this? And so you ask yourself different questions. And I think that's hard to do within a
6877400	6884440	single paper, but it could be something that you could try and, you know, sort of play around
6885800	6892520	with those approaches. I mean, you can do the same thing with an interview. Take an interview.
6892600	6902440	Look at the interview. What if this was true? The person is telling me. And how can I know
6902440	6908040	that it's true? And if you're looking at an interview positivistically, you will say, well,
6908040	6915160	only the things that are about verifiable facts, I know are to be true. And in order to find out
6915160	6921720	whether it's true, I will need to find someone else's view or I will need to get other data.
6922280	6930280	If you look at an interview interpretively, you would think, well, no, I don't really need anybody
6930280	6934280	else's opinion, because I'm only interested in their interpretation. And I'm not trying to do
6934280	6941720	anything wrong. And if you were to look at it critically, yeah, if you were looking at it
6941720	6948280	critically, you would be very skeptical of what that person is telling you. And you would be asked,
6948280	6952120	now, why are they telling me this? What is it they're trying to convince me of?
6954280	6962680	That you would look at it in a much more skeptical manner. So just thinking about those
6962680	6966520	things, even on one interview, it can get you to see things different.
6968520	6974840	See, exactly like the example that you gave about the hospitals merging, like for example,
6974840	6981160	in this case, we can try to understand the phenomena of decision making from, you know,
6981880	6987640	generative constructionist perspective. But also we can look at it from a conflict paradigm,
6987640	6993480	meaning that decisions are going to create conflicts. So in this case, our theoretical lens
6994120	7002520	would be different, depending on the paradigm. Yeah, indeed. Yes. I agree.
7002520	7012200	Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
