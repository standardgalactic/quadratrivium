 Anna manages a middle-sized food chain with several restaurants around town and relies on IT for data gathering and analysis to make informed business decisions. She interacts frequently with Jim, a software developer, to manage and manipulate the smart software systems she uses. This process can be time-consuming and challenging due to potential communication barriers.

Anna's situation significantly improves with the introduction of JetBrains MPS (Meta Programming System), an open-source tool that allows her to create a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) tailored specifically for her needs in restaurant management and business analysis. This DSL is designed to be intuitive and familiar, enabling Anna to directly implement actions such as setting up discounts for certain customers without needing a developer's assistance.

MPS generates real code from the commands entered in Anna's DSL, which then integrates with her existing management system. This approach not only simplifies Anna's workflow but also enhances communication within the system, leading to fewer errors and more precise outcomes.

Similarly, other professionals like Sam, a data scientist, and Bill, a mechanical engineer, can benefit from their own DSLs in their respective domains. These DSLs allow domain experts to focus on their expertise without worrying about the underlying technical complexities.

JetBrains MPS empowers users to work within their areas of expertise by providing specialized tooling that reduces complexity and streamlines the process from problem to solution. For more information, one can visit the JetBrains MPS website at jetbrains.com/mps. The key advantage of using DSLs is that they allow experts to define precisely what they want to accomplish without getting bogged down by the intricacies of programming.
