0	4000	This is Anna. She owns a middle-sized food chain around town.
4000	8000	Like many professionals today, Anna uses IT in her work.
8000	13000	Smart Software gathers data from all the restaurants in her chain to present it as graphs and tables
13000	18000	so Anna can see the whole picture and make decisions on business management and expansion.
18000	23000	To manipulate these programs, Anna usually contacts Jim, the software developer.
23000	29000	It always takes time and effort from both Jim and Anna to communicate and understand each other's needs and limitations.
29000	33000	And if for some reason Jim quits, Anna is in trouble.
33000	40000	All that work invested into essential comprehension would have to be done once again with a new developer.
40000	44000	Life gets much easier when MPS comes around.
44000	51000	JetBrains MPS is an open-source tool to express your domain specifics in the form of a programming language.
51000	53000	Here's how it works.
53000	57000	A language designer creates a unique domain-specific language
57000	63000	containing all the essential knowledge it is designed to perform the exact set of actions that Anna needs for her work.
63000	66000	It also comes in a form familiar to her.
66000	71000	Let's say Anna needs to offer a discount for a certain kind of customers in one of her locations.
71000	77000	She can set everything up herself, using comprehensive commands and getting a clear visual representation.
77000	83000	MPS then generates real code from her DSL and runs it inside her management system.
83000	87000	Each DSL is unique to suit the customer's specific needs.
87000	97000	Now, Sam, a data scientist, utilizes her specific DSL in her scientific research to create charts from her data in a tabular notation the way she is used to.
97000	103000	Now, Bill, a mechanical engineer, can use his own DSL at the factory he works in to communicate with embedded systems.
103000	109000	This approach dramatically increases productivity, simplifies work and improves communication.
109000	115000	It leads to fewer bugs too, since a DSL is constrained to perform the exact set of actions.
115000	118000	In most cases, you don't even need a developer to use it.
118000	125000	DSLs let domain experts reduce complexity and focus on the solution by using appropriate tooling for a specific domain.
125000	129000	Please visit our website at jetbrains.com.mps to learn more about it.
129000	133000	It's time to focus on what you do, not how you do it.
