1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
This is Anna. She owns a middle-sized food chain around town.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Like many professionals today, Anna uses IT in her work.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Smart Software gathers data from all the restaurants in her chain to present it as graphs and tables

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
so Anna can see the whole picture and make decisions on business management and expansion.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
To manipulate these programs, Anna usually contacts Jim, the software developer.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It always takes time and effort from both Jim and Anna to communicate and understand each other's needs and limitations.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And if for some reason Jim quits, Anna is in trouble.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
All that work invested into essential comprehension would have to be done once again with a new developer.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Life gets much easier when MPS comes around.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
JetBrains MPS is an open-source tool to express your domain specifics in the form of a programming language.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Here's how it works.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
A language designer creates a unique domain-specific language

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
containing all the essential knowledge it is designed to perform the exact set of actions that Anna needs for her work.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It also comes in a form familiar to her.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Let's say Anna needs to offer a discount for a certain kind of customers in one of her locations.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
She can set everything up herself, using comprehensive commands and getting a clear visual representation.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
MPS then generates real code from her DSL and runs it inside her management system.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Each DSL is unique to suit the customer's specific needs.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Now, Sam, a data scientist, utilizes her specific DSL in her scientific research to create charts from her data in a tabular notation the way she is used to.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Now, Bill, a mechanical engineer, can use his own DSL at the factory he works in to communicate with embedded systems.

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
This approach dramatically increases productivity, simplifies work and improves communication.

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It leads to fewer bugs too, since a DSL is constrained to perform the exact set of actions.

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
In most cases, you don't even need a developer to use it.

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,000
DSLs let domain experts reduce complexity and focus on the solution by using appropriate tooling for a specific domain.

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Please visit our website at jetbrains.com.mps to learn more about it.

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It's time to focus on what you do, not how you do it.
