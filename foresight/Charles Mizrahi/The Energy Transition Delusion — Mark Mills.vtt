WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.520
And there is no transition going on in the energy markets.

00:04.520 --> 00:06.480
It's just not visible in the data.

00:06.480 --> 00:10.040
So in my world also data, data matters.

00:10.040 --> 00:15.200
And the idea that we're in the middle of an accelerating transition is not showing up

00:15.200 --> 00:16.200
in the data.

00:16.200 --> 00:25.040
In fact, if we then go one step further and talk about aspirations, which is the aspiration,

00:25.040 --> 00:31.200
that's when you get to the delusion.

00:31.200 --> 00:32.960
My guest today is Mark Mills.

00:32.960 --> 00:36.880
Mark is a physicist, senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, and was named energy

00:36.880 --> 00:40.120
writer of the year by the American Energy Society.

00:40.120 --> 00:43.720
He has written several award-winning books, including his latest, The Cloud Revolution,

00:43.720 --> 00:48.920
and The Convergence of New Technologies will unleash the next economic boom and a roaring

00:48.920 --> 00:50.480
2020s.

00:50.480 --> 00:54.800
The Binding Administration plans to eliminate fossil fuels as a form of energy generation

00:54.800 --> 00:57.080
in the U.S. by 2035.

00:57.080 --> 00:58.720
Not so, says Mark.

00:58.720 --> 01:02.560
I recently sat down with him and he shared with me why the administration's transition

01:02.560 --> 01:06.520
to green energy is a delusion, in fact, impossible.

01:06.520 --> 01:16.000
And here we are going to need fossil fuel for at least the next several decades.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.800
Mark, thanks so much for coming on the show.

01:17.800 --> 01:18.800
Greatly appreciated.

01:18.800 --> 01:19.800
This is your second time.

01:19.800 --> 01:22.320
I remember the first time you came, it was about a year ago or so.

01:22.320 --> 01:23.320
It seems like yesterday.

01:23.320 --> 01:24.320
Yeah.

01:24.320 --> 01:25.320
It's our anniversary.

01:25.320 --> 01:26.320
Anniversary.

01:26.320 --> 01:28.560
We're going to have to get a cake.

01:28.560 --> 01:29.560
What's the first anniversary?

01:29.560 --> 01:30.560
What is that?

01:30.560 --> 01:31.560
I think paper or something.

01:31.560 --> 01:32.560
I don't know.

01:32.560 --> 01:33.560
Okay.

01:33.560 --> 01:34.560
I know.

01:34.560 --> 01:35.560
You didn't send me any flowers, any any chocolates.

01:35.560 --> 01:36.560
I got nothing.

01:36.560 --> 01:37.560
I got buckets.

01:37.560 --> 01:38.560
Wait till after.

01:38.560 --> 01:39.560
Wait till after the show.

01:39.560 --> 01:40.560
All right.

01:40.560 --> 01:46.480
So you were on the show about a year ago, and you totally enlightened me as to fossil

01:46.480 --> 01:50.280
fuels, EVs, green energy.

01:50.280 --> 01:54.960
And I remember at the time you just went through, because you just went right through with how

01:54.960 --> 02:00.680
green energy isn't so green or clean, especially when we talk about electric vehicles.

02:00.680 --> 02:05.200
So before we even begin, before we even begin, I want to bring you back to the state of the

02:05.200 --> 02:07.440
union address.

02:07.440 --> 02:11.440
President Biden is giving the state of the union, it was February 7th, so not too long

02:11.440 --> 02:12.440
ago.

02:12.440 --> 02:14.360
And he goes totally off script.

02:14.360 --> 02:15.360
It's not on the transcript.

02:15.360 --> 02:16.360
It's not anywhere.

02:16.360 --> 02:20.320
He says, we are still going to need oil and gas for a while.

02:20.320 --> 02:24.640
And then he tells a little anecdote, an oil executive asked him why his company, why his

02:24.640 --> 02:29.040
company should invest in fossil fuel projects in light of the negative business atmosphere

02:29.040 --> 02:31.000
for oil and gas projects.

02:31.000 --> 02:36.480
And Biden responded, we're going to need oil for at least another decade and beyond.

02:36.480 --> 02:42.760
You coined this a while ago, the energy transition delusion.

02:42.760 --> 02:47.680
Tell me why.

02:47.680 --> 02:54.640
Well, in the world that I live in, and this is not universal, not universal, I like to

02:54.640 --> 02:56.120
believe words have meaning.

02:56.120 --> 03:02.820
So I sort of, let's start with, and I recognize that words are elastic and we change their

03:02.820 --> 03:04.320
meanings over time.

03:04.320 --> 03:06.160
But usually it takes a long time.

03:06.160 --> 03:11.400
So a transition means going from something from one place to another, it's a transition.

03:11.600 --> 03:14.160
There is no transition going on in the energy markets.

03:14.160 --> 03:16.120
It's just not visible in the data.

03:16.120 --> 03:19.680
So in my world also data matters.

03:19.680 --> 03:24.840
And the idea that we're in the middle of an accelerating transition is not showing up

03:24.840 --> 03:25.840
in the data.

03:25.840 --> 03:34.640
In fact, if we then go one step further and talk about aspirations, which is the aspiration,

03:34.640 --> 03:36.400
that's when you get to the delusion.

03:36.400 --> 03:41.840
It's not just that it's delusional to call this a transition because there isn't one.

03:41.840 --> 03:47.200
And to restate what I mean by that is we're 20 years into what we could call the era of

03:47.200 --> 03:49.920
climate awareness, at least 20 years into it.

03:49.920 --> 03:55.160
The Western world was spent directly about $5 trillion, and I believe probably indirectly

03:55.160 --> 03:56.160
another $5 trillion.

03:56.160 --> 04:01.360
Well, let's say rounded up to about $10 trillion to avoid using hydrocarbons over the last

04:01.360 --> 04:02.880
20 years.

04:02.880 --> 04:06.760
And the share of the world's energy coming from hydrocarbons has indeed gone down in

04:06.760 --> 04:07.760
those 20 years.

04:07.760 --> 04:12.520
It's gone down from 86% to 84%.

04:12.520 --> 04:17.120
So that doesn't look like a rapid transition after $20 trillion of spending.

04:17.120 --> 04:18.520
It doesn't look like a transition.

04:18.520 --> 04:24.040
In fact, it's not a transition because over that same time period, the quantity of hydrocarbons

04:24.040 --> 04:29.000
consumed in absolute terms has gone up, and to put it in sort of relative terms has gone

04:29.000 --> 04:35.760
up by a quantity equal to adding 5 or 6 Saudi Arabia's worth of oil production in terms

04:35.760 --> 04:36.880
of energy equivalent.

04:36.880 --> 04:40.720
So that's the world's using more of everything, so that's not a transition.

04:40.720 --> 04:44.960
That's a feel like, you know, the better word to be transformation, we're adding new

04:44.960 --> 04:50.240
form of energy to the broad energy mix, which is a lot of windmills and solar arrays.

04:50.240 --> 04:51.240
This is true.

04:51.240 --> 04:54.720
We're adding new kinds of machines like electric vehicles.

04:54.720 --> 04:58.720
This is also indisputably true, and then we're going to add lots more of them.

04:58.760 --> 05:00.400
But that's not a transition.

05:00.400 --> 05:05.960
In fact, all of history, the development of new ways of producing and delivering energy

05:05.960 --> 05:07.440
to society have been additive.

05:07.440 --> 05:13.160
In fact, there's a sort of last point that I made many times I should make again.

05:13.160 --> 05:15.760
It's not that I like windmills.

05:15.760 --> 05:18.440
I've been in wind farms that stress the horizon in China.

05:18.440 --> 05:19.440
I think they're oppressive.

05:19.440 --> 05:21.360
I like solar arrays.

05:21.360 --> 05:23.160
In a way, my first patent was a solar device.

05:23.160 --> 05:28.120
It actually was a photo detector for guiding missiles, but I was a cold warrior back in

05:28.120 --> 05:30.440
the day, so I like the technology.

05:30.440 --> 05:32.200
I think I understand the technology.

05:32.200 --> 05:33.600
I'm a fan of the technology.

05:33.600 --> 05:37.160
If I were making a prediction today, I would say that the share of the world's energy coming

05:37.160 --> 05:42.840
from wind and solar in the coming decade will at least double, at least setting aside all

05:42.840 --> 05:45.520
the money being thrown at it foolishly.

05:45.520 --> 05:49.760
Even without that, we're going to increase the use of it because it's more cost effective

05:49.760 --> 05:50.760
than it ever was.

05:50.760 --> 05:53.200
So it has an enormous role, really important.

05:53.200 --> 05:58.240
But here we are today, to make the point again, all this excitement about wind and solar.

05:58.240 --> 06:05.320
As of right now, after trillions of spending, wind and solar combined provide the world

06:05.320 --> 06:10.560
one third as much energy as burning wood globally, burning wood.

06:10.560 --> 06:12.440
Wood is the oldest energy source known to man.

06:12.440 --> 06:16.880
We still get triple the energy globally from burning wood than we do from wind and solar

06:16.880 --> 06:17.960
combined.

06:17.960 --> 06:20.040
That's not because wind and solar won't take over wood.

06:20.040 --> 06:21.920
It has an America finally.

06:21.920 --> 06:26.840
So we now get twice to three times more energy from wind and solar than we do from burning

06:26.840 --> 06:27.840
wood.

06:27.840 --> 06:28.840
But it just takes time.

06:28.840 --> 06:29.880
It costs a lot of money.

06:29.880 --> 06:36.720
So the point of the delusion language is not meant to be an invective, although I guess

06:36.720 --> 06:39.160
it's obviously provocative.

06:39.160 --> 06:43.760
It's not there in the data where we are.

06:43.760 --> 06:47.000
And the more difficult thing to answer is, well, why can't we get there?

06:47.000 --> 06:48.400
I mean, so we heard it from the president.

06:48.400 --> 06:54.000
In a, I guess you could call it a form of social Tourette's, maybe.

06:54.000 --> 07:00.240
I mean, I'm not sure why Trump had social Tourette's even more epically than this president.

07:00.240 --> 07:02.480
Any president goes off script.

07:02.480 --> 07:05.480
So he says something that he has to know is true.

07:05.480 --> 07:10.280
And his energy secretary has since he said that off script remark, been running around

07:10.280 --> 07:15.040
the country, repeating that statement, actually went to the biggest energy conference in the

07:15.040 --> 07:21.720
world is zero week that my friends, Dan Jurgen, you know, pioneered and created down in Houston.

07:21.720 --> 07:25.400
And it brings people from all over the world and all forms of energy, not just oil and

07:25.400 --> 07:26.400
gas.

07:26.400 --> 07:30.680
She went there, secretary of energy, said, again, we're going to need oil and gas for

07:30.680 --> 07:32.260
a long time yet.

07:32.260 --> 07:37.960
And she sort of modified that, not just 10 years, when the reason she modified it with

07:37.960 --> 07:42.760
sort of more open ended, how long we'll need it is obvious.

07:42.760 --> 07:46.880
If you thought, if you thought as a business, pretend it's your money, that you have to

07:46.880 --> 07:50.520
make multi-billion dollar investments today and the government is going to ban your product

07:50.520 --> 07:52.720
in 10 years.

07:52.720 --> 07:53.720
Would you make those investments?

07:53.720 --> 07:54.720
Well, of course not.

07:54.720 --> 08:00.480
And of course, the current level of investing oil and gas is at a epic, if cyclical low,

08:00.480 --> 08:05.560
maybe lower than in relative terms than it's ever been in modern modern history.

08:05.560 --> 08:08.920
And why, why, why are the investments down?

08:08.920 --> 08:12.600
Is it because the oil and gas industry is afraid of competition?

08:12.600 --> 08:14.880
I don't think they're afraid of competition.

08:14.880 --> 08:18.160
What they're afraid of is regulation and taxation.

08:18.160 --> 08:22.560
And so you slow down and wait to see when things calm down and being simplistic, there

08:22.560 --> 08:23.560
are lots of factors.

08:23.560 --> 08:28.040
But if you're on a board and you're sort of thinking about these things, you know, you're

08:28.040 --> 08:32.680
making a lot of money now at current prices, even if even the current soften prices.

08:32.680 --> 08:33.680
What's the hurry?

08:33.680 --> 08:38.360
Let's just wait and see how things settle out and see what, if they're serious, I mean,

08:38.560 --> 08:39.760
I guess I would.

08:39.760 --> 08:43.800
This, by the way, this, this is already the same phenomenon as already in playing out

08:43.800 --> 08:50.840
in utility scale wind and solar where investments are down as subsidies get complicated.

08:50.840 --> 08:57.040
Nobody knows what the rules are as in as real costs have risen both for the costs of the

08:57.040 --> 09:05.000
machines and as the financing costs have risen because of interest rates and as uncertainties

09:05.000 --> 09:10.280
have risen with respect to if you're the developer going to put billions to work, you

09:10.280 --> 09:14.600
might, you might begin to worry about the tolerance of markets to high cost energy.

09:14.920 --> 09:21.440
And one of the things that is sort of central to the trope of the energy transition is that

09:21.440 --> 09:22.600
wind and solar are cheaper.

09:22.760 --> 09:24.240
That's just central to the thesis.

09:24.440 --> 09:26.120
It's baked into every forecast.

09:26.680 --> 09:33.560
And yet there is no jurisdiction in the world, in Europe or United States, no state and no

09:33.560 --> 09:39.240
country in which the increased penetration of wind and solar has led to reduced utility

09:39.640 --> 09:42.400
grid costs have all been associated with higher costs.

09:42.840 --> 09:49.800
So if they're cheaper and we're at epic levels of spending, I'm waiting for the cheaper power

09:49.800 --> 09:52.520
if you're a consumer and the inverses happen.

09:52.520 --> 09:58.720
So I think, you know, cooler minds setting aside the hyperbole around all this stuff and

09:58.720 --> 10:03.240
the anxiety about why we have to do this, which is beyond obvious what the motivations are.

10:04.440 --> 10:13.480
You know, the combination of scale imposing real costs, the combination of the exposure of

10:14.200 --> 10:19.400
the fragility of energy systems that the Ukraine invasion illustrated, because what Europe did

10:19.400 --> 10:23.000
was build a more economically and structurally fragile energy system.

10:23.480 --> 10:28.600
And by that I mean both by depending on an unreliable source of cheap energy, but also

10:29.320 --> 10:34.120
failing to build in their own borders, reliable sources of cheap energy.

10:34.600 --> 10:35.320
Right.

10:35.320 --> 10:40.280
So all of this, let me, you packed up, you threw out a lot of great information there.

10:40.280 --> 10:46.920
I just want to go back to one thing, that the Biden administration was talking about being,

10:47.640 --> 10:52.600
going to zero missions, totally green energy out at 2035 or 2050.

10:52.600 --> 10:54.520
All those dates really have been thrown out the window.

10:54.520 --> 10:56.920
They were just dates probably just to get out there, right?

10:57.480 --> 11:00.600
The numbers and the facts and the data didn't support any of that, right?

11:01.560 --> 11:06.520
No, there's no, there's, I think what we have is the Energy Information Administration,

11:06.520 --> 11:11.640
which is the Department of Energy's, I mean, tautological information agency.

11:12.360 --> 11:14.200
It's pretty, it's pretty apolitical.

11:14.200 --> 11:18.360
They've been very good over the, over the decades in providing data based on what's

11:18.360 --> 11:21.480
actually happening as opposed to policy aspirations.

11:21.480 --> 11:26.280
Their goal is not to make the policy, but to make forecasts, report data.

11:27.480 --> 11:30.600
Make forecasts based on stated policy.

11:30.600 --> 11:36.600
And they just issued their latest analysis and they show that pushing out to 2030, 2035, 2040,

11:36.600 --> 11:38.520
we don't get anywhere near zero missions.

11:38.520 --> 11:40.920
If you implement everything in the Inflation Reduction Act,

11:41.560 --> 11:46.200
set aside the Orwellian name for that, but all the spending, which is hundreds of billions,

11:46.200 --> 11:50.600
literally probably direct spending and mandated spending.

11:50.600 --> 11:53.640
Cause a lot of these things have mandates that are off book spending.

11:53.640 --> 11:59.160
So there's probably a trillion dollars of spending in the two pieces of legislation,

11:59.160 --> 12:05.240
Infrastructure Act, Inflation Reduction Act on wind solar transmission and electric cars.

12:05.240 --> 12:10.760
And what you get is, you know, something like 15 to 20% reduction in US CO2 emissions by

12:11.320 --> 12:16.840
2040 or so, which, okay, I mean, that's not zero, but it's not zero missions.

12:16.840 --> 12:21.560
And more importantly, as the EIA points out, and now there's this, that reduction,

12:21.560 --> 12:24.680
which is about a gigatonic carbon dioxide, by the way,

12:25.240 --> 12:29.400
we've already gone down about a gigatonic carbon dioxide in the last 20 years,

12:29.400 --> 12:32.680
mostly because of the cheap shale gas replacing coal, of course.

12:32.680 --> 12:37.960
But that's wiped out by three to four years of increased coal consumption

12:38.600 --> 12:41.880
in China alone, never mind India, Indonesia and other places.

12:41.880 --> 12:43.880
So there's, there's sort of this bizarre,

12:46.440 --> 12:51.160
it's almost surreal ignoring of what's going, really going on in the world.

12:51.720 --> 12:57.640
Which is CO2 emissions are going up as countries expand and chase energy that's cheap.

12:57.640 --> 13:03.720
And the CO2 emissions reductions coming in the United States come at staggering costs

13:03.720 --> 13:06.040
and have no effect on the overall global trends.

13:06.680 --> 13:16.440
And even Bill Gates at the last great gathering that gets vilified in Davos,

13:16.440 --> 13:19.800
gave a, you know, private interview and talked about all this stuff.

13:19.800 --> 13:23.640
And he, and he said, and I don't think I'm gonna get the quote wrong.

13:23.640 --> 13:24.920
So two things that are important.

13:25.560 --> 13:31.000
One is that even if we get to zero emissions by 2050, he doesn't think we can.

13:31.960 --> 13:35.000
Things we have to try, obviously he said that a lot, but we're not going to.

13:35.000 --> 13:40.840
But even if we got there, then that would not mean that the world's warming won't continue.

13:40.840 --> 13:46.680
The models would show the world will continue to warm roughly as much as the models purport

13:46.680 --> 13:47.400
it will do now.

13:48.600 --> 13:50.120
Whether you believe the models or not, it's not the point.

13:50.120 --> 13:54.760
The models don't show any material change going out for the next century after that,

13:55.640 --> 13:57.480
even if we spend that kind of money.

13:57.480 --> 14:01.080
The thing that really bothers me, what animates most of my work is not,

14:01.720 --> 14:07.400
it's not just that it's a delusionary to think that we can get rid of hydrocarbons quickly.

14:08.440 --> 14:08.920
Not never.

14:08.920 --> 14:13.000
Never is different than quickly, but quickly meaning in the foreseeable future in decades

14:13.720 --> 14:17.880
is that the cost of doing this is economically and socially destructive.

14:17.880 --> 14:21.480
It is, in my view, immoral.

14:21.480 --> 14:23.320
And it's immoral for this reason.

14:23.880 --> 14:32.040
The whole world has, really all of history, pursued the goal of increasing wealth

14:32.040 --> 14:34.520
for the maximum number of people, increasing productivity.

14:34.520 --> 14:39.640
Productivity is always defined very simplistically, but 100% accurately,

14:39.640 --> 14:43.880
getting more outputs for fewer inputs of dollars, labor and materials.

14:44.440 --> 14:49.080
The energy transition aspirations get the same outputs, if you're lucky,

14:49.080 --> 14:52.200
with increased inputs of dollars, labor and materials.

14:52.840 --> 14:57.320
This is, it puts more simply, this is wealth destroying.

14:57.880 --> 15:01.320
And at the scales we're talking about, I don't mean having a few percent of electricity

15:01.320 --> 15:05.720
from wind and solar and 100 million electric cars, that's irrelevant.

15:05.720 --> 15:07.160
It's in the noise, frankly.

15:08.040 --> 15:10.840
But the scales imagined, it's profoundly wealth destroying.

15:11.400 --> 15:15.160
And the people who are impacted by that are not the wealthy.

15:15.800 --> 15:17.320
So the wealthy are less wealthy.

15:17.880 --> 15:19.240
Okay, no one cares.

15:19.960 --> 15:24.360
It's the wealth destruction of the middle class and the people who are poor.

15:26.360 --> 15:32.840
It's indescribably offensive to me to have a path that's doing that,

15:32.840 --> 15:37.160
which is not the same as saying, because it always gets, one label is all,

15:37.160 --> 15:39.880
then you don't care about what we have to try to do.

15:41.160 --> 15:42.680
I care about changing energy systems.

15:42.680 --> 15:43.560
I may not agree with you.

15:44.600 --> 15:46.760
It was like, it's like an interrupter.

15:46.760 --> 15:51.240
I haven't met anyone who would say they're pro-pollution.

15:51.240 --> 15:52.840
They want more pollution in the future.

15:52.840 --> 15:54.120
We're all on the same side.

15:54.120 --> 15:57.000
It's just, as you mentioned, how much it's going to cost

15:57.000 --> 15:59.800
and how much benefit are we going to get for each dollar spent?

16:00.120 --> 16:07.080
It's beyond obvious the money matters, or symmetrically follow the money,

16:07.080 --> 16:10.840
as the old ad is about saying who benefits from different policies.

16:10.840 --> 16:12.200
But here's the problem.

16:12.200 --> 16:15.400
It's not only is the rest of the world increasing its carbon dioxide emissions

16:15.400 --> 16:20.600
as the West tries to reduce it at extraordinarily high costs.

16:21.240 --> 16:22.840
It's that it's not doing what people claim.

16:23.480 --> 16:27.240
I mean, it's dishonest, intellectually dishonest,

16:27.240 --> 16:30.760
to pretend, for example, the electric cars are zero emissions.

16:30.760 --> 16:31.240
They're not.

16:31.240 --> 16:32.520
They're elsewhere emissions.

16:32.520 --> 16:36.680
What you'd want to know is how much the emissions are today

16:37.480 --> 16:42.760
and how much they will be in the future as you push harder on getting more EVs in the market

16:44.280 --> 16:48.440
to result in the higher emissions to make the vehicles.

16:49.160 --> 16:52.120
Obviously, it offsets emissions from combusting gasoline.

16:52.120 --> 16:55.480
This is beyond obvious and infantile observation,

16:55.480 --> 16:56.600
but it's not zero emissions.

16:57.160 --> 16:58.680
It's other place emissions.

16:59.720 --> 17:01.800
People know that reflexively when you say it.

17:01.800 --> 17:04.360
I mean, they say, OK, yeah, well, I have to have a power plant

17:04.360 --> 17:06.920
and everybody jokes about how the power plant could be coal fired.

17:06.920 --> 17:08.040
Well, that's no joke.

17:08.040 --> 17:09.160
I mean, it depends.

17:09.160 --> 17:10.680
It depends on where you charge the car.

17:11.320 --> 17:15.160
And when you charge the car, how you're filling that battery up.

17:15.160 --> 17:19.560
I mean, this may be obvious, but it's most of the calculations that purport

17:19.560 --> 17:23.640
an electric vehicle is zero emissions are based on average emissions from a grid.

17:24.360 --> 17:25.720
Well, there's no average.

17:25.720 --> 17:29.400
There's no average emissions in filling the vehicle.

17:29.400 --> 17:33.400
When the vehicle is fueled is when the emissions occur.

17:33.400 --> 17:37.320
So if you fuel the vehicle at night in some parts of the United States,

17:37.320 --> 17:40.120
you're filling it with hydro hydro electricity in other places.

17:40.120 --> 17:41.560
Let me just let me just drill down on this.

17:41.560 --> 17:45.800
And so we're on the same page and our listeners could get this.

17:46.760 --> 17:48.040
True, there is nothing.

17:48.040 --> 17:50.760
No emissions coming out of the vehicle.

17:51.480 --> 17:52.200
But fuel.

17:52.200 --> 17:53.800
There's no tailpipe.

17:53.800 --> 17:55.160
So apparently there's not.

17:55.160 --> 18:01.400
But fueling by plugging in your EV, you are creating emissions by.

18:01.400 --> 18:01.800
Somewhere.

18:02.600 --> 18:03.240
Electricity.

18:03.240 --> 18:03.720
Making power.

18:03.720 --> 18:05.240
Which doesn't come from magic dust.

18:05.960 --> 18:06.520
No.

18:06.520 --> 18:12.280
So you would and the EV focus is important because it's the preoccupation

18:12.280 --> 18:13.480
of governments these days, right?

18:13.480 --> 18:17.400
We've we've moved beyond mandating 100% wind and solar.

18:18.120 --> 18:20.840
That's sort of old news and we can't get there fast enough.

18:20.840 --> 18:22.680
So we have the grids that we have.

18:22.680 --> 18:23.960
Grids take time to build out.

18:24.520 --> 18:27.560
But it gets that there's lots more wind and solar on grids,

18:27.560 --> 18:28.440
depending where you live.

18:29.400 --> 18:30.440
The most is in Texas.

18:30.440 --> 18:32.840
The second most is in the midcontinent of the United States.

18:32.840 --> 18:33.640
Lots of windmills.

18:34.520 --> 18:37.640
How far that can go is an interesting separate discussion.

18:38.280 --> 18:42.120
And they too don't have tailpipe, so to speak.

18:42.120 --> 18:44.040
They don't emit anything when they're operating.

18:44.040 --> 18:46.840
They do cause emissions when they get built.

18:46.920 --> 18:49.880
Because windmills are built from concrete and steel,

18:49.880 --> 18:55.800
which require metallurgical coal and coal and oil and natural gas to make and fabricate.

18:55.800 --> 18:59.720
But you know, measured over the lifetime of the operation,

18:59.720 --> 19:02.840
it emits less CO2 than burning natural gas.

19:02.840 --> 19:03.240
It's true.

19:05.080 --> 19:09.640
How much that costs you is what matters, not whether that's true or not.

19:09.640 --> 19:12.840
But the EV has sort of become the monomaniacal preoccupation.

19:12.840 --> 19:16.440
I think at last count, I think there's now a dozen states.

19:16.840 --> 19:18.520
The number may have gone up in the last month.

19:18.520 --> 19:20.680
I think the state of Maryland, where I live,

19:20.680 --> 19:22.200
as the governor said they're going to pledge,

19:23.160 --> 19:27.240
a dozen states that are proposing by 2035 or 2040,

19:27.240 --> 19:31.480
depending on the state, to utterly ban the sale of internal combustion engines completely.

19:32.040 --> 19:36.120
I think the number of countries that have made such proclamations or planned to make them

19:36.120 --> 19:37.080
is now the dozens.

19:37.720 --> 19:43.400
So this is all predicated entirely on that these are zero emissions vehicles.

19:43.400 --> 19:44.760
That's the entire predication.

19:45.080 --> 19:46.200
I want you to hang on right there.

19:46.200 --> 19:48.600
I want you to hang on right there because when we spoke last time,

19:49.320 --> 19:55.320
you pointed out, I said, Charles, these cars don't show up in the showroom by magic.

19:55.320 --> 19:56.920
It took something to get there.

19:56.920 --> 19:59.320
And you pointed me in the direction of Volkswagen,

19:59.320 --> 20:05.080
and who had it on their site, which showed the crossover between an EV and a,

20:05.080 --> 20:06.680
I think it was a diesel powered car.

20:06.680 --> 20:07.720
I'm not sure what their thing was.

20:07.720 --> 20:08.200
Right.

20:08.200 --> 20:09.240
Yeah, it was diesel.

20:09.240 --> 20:14.440
Close to seven years before the 70,000 miles.

20:14.440 --> 20:15.480
70,000 miles, right?

20:15.480 --> 20:17.240
Which is 10,000 miles a year, let's say.

20:17.240 --> 20:19.720
So you're talking about seven years on average,

20:19.720 --> 20:25.720
seven years before the EV makes sense in terms of emitting CO2.

20:25.720 --> 20:26.680
Is that more or less right?

20:27.800 --> 20:30.120
Yeah, they're studying others.

20:30.120 --> 20:31.000
They're not alone on this.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.680
Volvo published a similar analysis.

20:32.680 --> 20:34.680
So what they're doing is they're doing two things.

20:35.480 --> 20:38.760
They're counting the emissions that's needed to make the EV and its battery.

20:39.400 --> 20:41.480
And the emissions needed to make the internal combustion engine.

20:42.040 --> 20:48.760
And so these are the noble processes to mine minerals at copper and aluminum

20:49.480 --> 20:53.080
and refine them and assemble them into an electric vehicle.

20:53.080 --> 20:55.880
And you do the same with the steel to make an internal combustion engine.

20:55.880 --> 20:56.680
So you count that.

20:57.480 --> 21:00.840
It's called embodied emissions or embodied energy.

21:00.840 --> 21:02.200
It's our body.

21:02.200 --> 21:07.560
So you count what it takes just to get the vehicle to your driveway, the emissions for that.

21:08.200 --> 21:12.760
And everything has emissions associated with manufacturing because hydrocarbons are used

21:12.760 --> 21:13.560
everywhere.

21:13.560 --> 21:17.320
So that's the world we live in, not the world we aspire to be in in the far future.

21:17.960 --> 21:23.560
And then you look, in the case of both these studies, at the average, back to the average,

21:23.560 --> 21:27.480
is the average emissions from the electricity you have available in Europe

21:28.280 --> 21:30.920
over the coming five to 10 years to operate the vehicle.

21:30.920 --> 21:34.040
Because the grid that exists is the grid that you're going to use,

21:34.040 --> 21:35.960
not the grid your imagined will exist in the future.

21:36.760 --> 21:41.800
And yes, so what they determined is that for the first seven years of driving,

21:41.800 --> 21:45.000
if you'd driven the diesel vehicle, you would have admitted less CO2

21:45.640 --> 21:46.760
than if you bought the EV.

21:47.400 --> 21:50.200
Because a combination of the two emissions, the battery beam,

21:51.160 --> 21:54.280
the mining and the battery being fabricated, and the power plants

21:54.840 --> 21:57.960
took you that long to pay off your carbon debt.

21:57.960 --> 21:58.920
Now, this is important.

21:58.920 --> 22:05.800
The Volkswagen study was based on a small EV using a battery less than half the size

22:05.800 --> 22:06.760
of a Tesla battery.

22:06.760 --> 22:07.720
And what was the range of that?

22:07.720 --> 22:09.880
So it was a really small range on that battery, right?

22:09.880 --> 22:11.320
Yeah, it's a 250-mile range.

22:11.320 --> 22:15.480
But for a light vehicle, for round town use, which is a lot of people use them for,

22:15.480 --> 22:18.360
that's fine, perfectly reasonable assumption.

22:18.360 --> 22:20.440
But most people aren't buying those vehicles at the moment.

22:20.440 --> 22:25.880
The biggest sellers are the vehicles with the big batteries in the range of three to 400 miles.

22:25.880 --> 22:28.760
So, or put it differently, that means you have a battery twice as big.

22:28.760 --> 22:29.960
Your carbon debt is double.

22:30.920 --> 22:35.400
So the crossover point shifts out from seven years to 10 or 12 years,

22:35.400 --> 22:37.480
which for most people, that's never.

22:37.480 --> 22:41.320
Now, if you assume that the vehicle has a second life and in its second life,

22:41.320 --> 22:43.960
it's submitting less CO2, okay.

22:43.960 --> 22:48.280
But the point is the illusion that you, as the owner of that vehicle,

22:48.280 --> 22:52.360
have saved CO2 is totally shattered by those assumptions.

22:52.360 --> 22:54.280
Now, here's the rub.

22:54.280 --> 22:59.160
We actually don't know exactly how much CO2 is emitted by a specific EV.

22:59.160 --> 23:01.960
Because we don't know exactly where the materials came from for that EV.

23:02.520 --> 23:06.200
We know exactly how much CO2 is emitted by an internal combustion engine vehicle,

23:06.200 --> 23:10.760
because it's the same every time you fill a tank up, there's no change.

23:10.760 --> 23:11.960
There's no mystery.

23:11.960 --> 23:12.760
It's transparent.

23:12.760 --> 23:13.400
It's obvious.

23:14.040 --> 23:18.440
What we do know about the emissions associated with manufacturing an EV

23:18.440 --> 23:20.200
is those emissions are going up, not down.

23:20.200 --> 23:21.720
And it's not me saying this.

23:21.720 --> 23:25.160
This is the International Energy Agency, International Monetary Fund,

23:25.160 --> 23:26.520
the UN bodies.

23:27.400 --> 23:35.640
This is a geological, if you like, fact that the net new ton of copper or steel or aluminum

23:35.640 --> 23:39.480
or molybdenum or zinc are coming from what are called lower grade ores.

23:39.480 --> 23:43.800
You'd have to dig up more rock to get the same pound or ton of metals.

23:43.800 --> 23:48.680
Digging up more rock means more energy and grinding more rock more energy.

23:48.680 --> 23:49.800
Let me stop you there one second.

23:50.760 --> 23:57.800
You put in one of your papers that you have to move 500,000 pounds of dirt

23:58.440 --> 24:04.520
in order to mine enough metals, minerals to make one, one EV battery.

24:05.080 --> 24:06.360
Could you just break that down for me?

24:07.560 --> 24:11.640
So the way you sort of think about this is as you start with the point,

24:11.640 --> 24:13.880
how big is the fuel tank and electric vehicle?

24:13.880 --> 24:18.760
If it's the one that everybody buys, not everybody, the majority that would be purchased,

24:18.920 --> 24:25.000
they're about a half a ton or 1,000 pounds, the battery, which is a digression tells you why

24:25.000 --> 24:29.160
the electric vehicle uses a lot more aluminum on average than a regular vehicle because you're

24:29.160 --> 24:33.720
trying to offset what used to be an 80 pounds of gasoline with a 1,000 pound fuel tank.

24:34.520 --> 24:40.280
So you offset that by more aluminum, which also causes a lot of emissions.

24:40.280 --> 24:43.160
It's a very energy intensive, emissions intensive metal.

24:43.720 --> 24:46.360
And that often is not included in the calculations, by the way.

24:46.360 --> 24:49.640
It's just left out and ignored by some of the analysts.

24:50.520 --> 24:52.360
So you have a 1,000 pound battery.

24:53.560 --> 24:55.880
Then you look at the various components of the battery.

24:55.880 --> 24:59.160
It's copper, it's steel, and it's aluminum.

24:59.160 --> 25:02.120
Has lithium, of course, because it's a lithium-ion battery.

25:02.120 --> 25:03.160
Has cobalt.

25:03.160 --> 25:07.400
It has far more graphite, by the way, than it does lithium or any other element.

25:07.400 --> 25:10.760
It's the most common element, and it's a very intensive

25:11.400 --> 25:14.600
material to get to make all forms of lithium batteries.

25:14.600 --> 25:20.760
And then what you do is you chase up, this is all findoutable, if you like, in Magic Google

25:20.760 --> 25:21.640
Machine.

25:21.640 --> 25:25.160
You could look up, what's the average ore grade for copper?

25:25.160 --> 25:26.920
What was it 100 years ago or 10 years ago?

25:26.920 --> 25:28.440
What's the average ore grade for aluminum?

25:28.440 --> 25:31.320
The ore grade for nickel and all the different metals.

25:31.320 --> 25:31.960
It's clean ore grade.

25:31.960 --> 25:32.520
That is what?

25:34.040 --> 25:38.680
So ore grade, and when I was in my impetuous youth, I worked briefly for a mining company.

25:38.680 --> 25:41.160
So I have a certain affection for mining and miners.

25:41.160 --> 25:45.080
I like a Canadian uranium, gold, and silver mining company.

25:46.040 --> 25:52.760
Ore grade means the percentage of the rock that you found, or that contains the stuff you want.

25:52.760 --> 25:57.160
So the richest ore grades in the metals world is iron.

25:57.160 --> 26:02.760
Iron can be, you can find iron, which is the rock that you're digging up that contains iron,

26:02.760 --> 26:04.040
can be 20% iron.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.520
So you could do the math here.

26:06.520 --> 26:09.080
That means for a pound of iron, you dig up five pounds of rock.

26:10.040 --> 26:15.240
Copper, however, and a lot of the other metals are much less common in the earth's crust.

26:15.240 --> 26:18.760
So the average copper ore grade now is well below 1%.

26:19.480 --> 26:24.120
So a pound of copper, you have to dig up 100 pounds of rock, and it's declining.

26:24.120 --> 26:25.880
This is true for every metal.

26:26.520 --> 26:31.000
The percentage of the rock that's the metal you want, typically the single digit percentages

26:31.000 --> 26:31.880
are a fraction of percent.

26:31.880 --> 26:36.280
And if it's the rarer metals, that's so-called rare earths, even more, which aren't rare,

26:36.280 --> 26:37.960
by the way, they're actually very common.

26:37.960 --> 26:43.160
They just, I mean, in the geology of the earth they're common, geography of the earth,

26:43.160 --> 26:45.560
they just aren't, they have rare properties.

26:45.560 --> 26:47.880
They're called rare earths because they're properties, not because of their,

26:48.520 --> 26:51.960
we know where they are, we know how to find them, you have to dig up lots of dirt.

26:51.960 --> 26:54.040
So you have to dig up two kinds of dirt.

26:54.040 --> 26:57.080
You have to dig up what's called overburden, you have to get to the ore body.

26:57.080 --> 27:00.040
So if you're lucky, it's an open pit mine on the surface.

27:00.040 --> 27:02.280
You don't have to get a lot of dirt out of the way.

27:02.280 --> 27:07.000
So you have rocks and dirt, you have to get out of the way, dig that up, it's just waste.

27:07.000 --> 27:10.840
Then you dig up the ore and then you're digging up again.

27:10.840 --> 27:14.360
If it's a ton of copper, you're digging up, you know, not a hundred tons, right?

27:14.360 --> 27:17.880
You're digging over over a hundred tons of ore, which you then have to crush

27:17.880 --> 27:20.920
with big energy consuming machines into powder.

27:20.920 --> 27:22.440
Do you have to crush rocks?

27:22.440 --> 27:25.880
Then you have to dissolve the rocks with sulfuric acid.

27:25.880 --> 27:28.840
We're dissolving rocks and the more rock you have to dissolve,

27:28.840 --> 27:31.960
the more acids you have to use, the more acids, the more energy to make the acids,

27:32.520 --> 27:34.440
the more energy to keep everything clean.

27:34.520 --> 27:39.640
It means this is a beyond obvious do loop of very energy-intensive activities.

27:39.640 --> 27:42.600
And then when you get the refined metal, you have to ship it.

27:42.600 --> 27:46.120
This is a refining process like everything else is separate from the mining.

27:46.120 --> 27:50.200
Then you have to go to the chemical industries that convert the refined metals

27:50.200 --> 27:55.320
or minerals into the nature of the specific material you need for the battery,

27:55.320 --> 27:58.440
which is another chemical and energy-intensive process.

27:58.440 --> 27:59.000
That's the most...

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
When you put that all together, that's where you get this,

28:01.800 --> 28:07.480
you know, not only does it take 500,000 pounds of rock extracted for your one battery,

28:08.360 --> 28:13.560
but all in, if you mentioned oil terms, you're going to consume between

28:13.560 --> 28:19.320
one in 300 barrels of oil equivalent in energy to make a battery that can hold

28:19.320 --> 28:21.560
about one barrel of oil equivalent of energy.

28:21.560 --> 28:22.200
Amazing.

28:22.200 --> 28:24.200
I looked at two points I just want to share with you,

28:24.200 --> 28:27.240
but I don't want to hear you keep talking because I just keep learning so much.

28:27.560 --> 28:35.000
These earth-moving machines, huge, huge, huge machines that move all this earth you mentioned,

28:35.000 --> 28:40.040
I looked up and the average one is 237,000 gallons per year,

28:41.240 --> 28:42.760
12 feet high off the ground.

28:42.760 --> 28:43.640
These are huge.

28:43.640 --> 28:47.640
And that's why I guess, you know, in mining, energy costs are such a big factor,

28:47.640 --> 28:49.560
you know, you have to move this stuff.

28:49.560 --> 28:54.520
And it just boggles my mind that people do not take this into account.

28:54.520 --> 28:57.720
They think it's fairy dust that it comes here and I did too.

28:57.720 --> 29:01.320
I got to admit when I got two of my two Teslas and I traded them,

29:01.320 --> 29:03.400
I thought I was doing something great for the environment.

29:03.400 --> 29:10.360
And then now every night that I plug it in, I realized that it didn't come here by magic.

29:10.360 --> 29:13.640
All of the fuel that was needed to do that.

29:13.640 --> 29:19.960
The second thing I just wanted to touch on for us is that most of this refinery

29:19.960 --> 29:24.440
is done in China because who the heck wants a refinery in their backyard?

29:24.440 --> 29:24.920
Is that right?

29:26.280 --> 29:30.760
Yeah. Well, back to your machines, by the way, I love these big mining trucks.

29:30.760 --> 29:34.120
They're literally the size of a house, these trucks, the size of a house.

29:34.120 --> 29:34.920
They're great.

29:34.920 --> 29:39.080
And the idea that we're going to convert those mining trucks to not using diesel in their future is...

29:39.080 --> 29:40.360
What are they going to do on solar?

29:40.360 --> 29:41.960
You know, these things are huge.

29:41.960 --> 29:45.800
You can make them, you can run them on batteries too, if you make enough batteries.

29:45.800 --> 29:51.640
But to say it's impractical to do it is a breathtaking understatement.

29:52.360 --> 29:56.360
We're not going to be running these trucks anything other than big diesel generators

29:56.360 --> 29:58.840
and diesel engines for a very, very long time.

29:58.840 --> 30:00.680
And by that I mean, you know, many, many decades.

30:00.680 --> 30:05.400
The machines themselves have a life, a useful life of 30 to 40 years.

30:05.400 --> 30:08.360
Once you spend millions of dollars, tens of millions of a machine,

30:08.360 --> 30:09.800
you're going to run it for a long time.

30:09.800 --> 30:12.680
But, you know, back to your question of where the refineries are.

30:12.760 --> 30:16.360
I mean, so they're elsewhere.

30:16.360 --> 30:19.080
They're not in America or Europe by and large.

30:19.080 --> 30:22.520
There's some, not many, very, very few.

30:23.240 --> 30:25.400
So what we're doing is we're making an interesting trade.

30:25.400 --> 30:25.640
Right.

30:25.640 --> 30:28.600
The United States in particular is domestically self-efficient.

30:28.600 --> 30:32.120
In fact, in hydrocarbons, we're a net exporter of hydrocarbons if we count all in.

30:32.760 --> 30:37.080
We were almost, we were briefly a net exporter of oil and oil products.

30:37.080 --> 30:40.600
Right, in 2018, wasn't it 2018 or so we were a net exporter?

30:40.920 --> 30:46.840
Well, it was 2019, 2020, into that year, we were still, if you count, you know,

30:46.840 --> 30:49.560
we still import because there's an arbitrage, you know, you import crew,

30:49.560 --> 30:50.680
you export refined products.

30:51.240 --> 30:57.320
But we are functionally independent of the need for imports functionally.

30:57.320 --> 31:02.520
I just remember back in the 70s during the energy crisis and going to school there.

31:02.520 --> 31:07.160
And it was always a dream that one day America would be self-sufficient.

31:07.160 --> 31:09.400
And we had OPEC with a gun to our head.

31:09.400 --> 31:13.960
And after the the Arabs really were of 1973, when they placed it in Bargo,

31:13.960 --> 31:17.080
the oil was there, but they didn't ship it to us to the United States.

31:18.120 --> 31:20.360
We were, we didn't have production.

31:20.360 --> 31:21.720
We were way, way behind.

31:22.280 --> 31:27.400
And now it seems that we traded off OPEC for China.

31:27.400 --> 31:32.120
We're now reliant on China refining our metals and lithium batteries.

31:32.120 --> 31:35.400
And this whole green energy seems like to be playing into the hands of China.

31:35.960 --> 31:37.480
Is it might be a little crazy on that?

31:37.480 --> 31:39.080
Or is that those are the facts?

31:39.080 --> 31:44.600
No, it's that you're just stating, let's, let's put aside the geopolitical implications.

31:44.600 --> 31:46.360
You could just look at the facts first, right?

31:46.360 --> 31:49.480
I mean, the U.S. is a net export of hydrocarbons.

31:49.480 --> 31:51.640
China is a net importer of hydrocarbons.

31:51.640 --> 31:56.520
China has a market share in refining what the IEA, the International Energy Agency,

31:56.520 --> 32:01.720
calls energy minerals, the things like copper and lithium carbonate.

32:01.720 --> 32:08.840
So the refining of energy minerals, that capacity in China, in terms of global market share, is

32:08.840 --> 32:11.800
double OPEC's global market share in oil.

32:12.520 --> 32:19.080
So China by itself is the OPEC on steroids of energy minerals for refining.

32:19.640 --> 32:22.760
Hey, if you're a reasonable person, would say, well, can we do something about that?

32:22.760 --> 32:23.800
Can we do something about that?

32:23.800 --> 32:25.320
Couldn't we resharrow those refineries?

32:25.320 --> 32:25.880
Of course we can.

32:27.240 --> 32:30.760
You first, you have to want to, you have to put in place the kind of regulatory environment

32:30.760 --> 32:33.720
that makes it possible to build them economically.

32:33.720 --> 32:38.680
That hasn't happened in any of the legislation by any president, by the way, in decades.

32:39.240 --> 32:44.360
So we don't have the appetite politically to do that, and we're not doing it, even if

32:44.360 --> 32:45.880
tomorrow we decided to do it.

32:46.520 --> 32:53.480
The velocity of demand for those minerals, the mandating batteries be put in cars instead of gas

32:53.480 --> 32:59.640
tanks, vastly exceeds the velocity with which we could reshor the supply of those minerals.

32:59.640 --> 33:00.920
So the mining is elsewhere.

33:00.920 --> 33:03.320
We can't open mines easily in America.

33:03.320 --> 33:10.600
The administration last year reversed permits that were millions of dollars in years in

33:10.600 --> 33:14.760
development for copper and nickel mines, three of them in the United States, just reversed

33:14.760 --> 33:21.400
the permits after many years of trying to get the permits in place and passing all the tests,

33:21.400 --> 33:22.280
if you like.

33:22.280 --> 33:24.920
They passed in flying colors, they were failed anyway.

33:24.920 --> 33:31.160
So the path that we're on is unequivocally one of increasing dependencies on foreign sources

33:31.160 --> 33:34.280
for the premier materials and the refined materials.

33:34.280 --> 33:39.160
But we're sort of hiding behind the fig leaf of subsidizing what are called EV factories or

33:39.160 --> 33:39.960
battery factories.

33:39.960 --> 33:46.600
These are assembly plants, which are still dependent on importing metals and materials

33:46.600 --> 33:48.760
and minerals refined elsewhere.

33:48.760 --> 33:53.960
So it would be no different than the symmetrical equivalent is what you described going back

33:53.960 --> 33:59.960
to the dawns of the energy embargoes, oil embargoes, is that we were assembling cars

33:59.960 --> 34:04.920
in America and we, in fact, had very few foreign cars sold in America at that time.

34:04.920 --> 34:09.240
But we were very dependent on gasoline and oil imports, the fuel cars.

34:09.240 --> 34:14.600
So what we're doing now is replicating the exact situation we were in 50 years ago.

34:14.600 --> 34:23.000
We just replaced refined minerals and metals and these things with the lithium

34:23.800 --> 34:29.880
cobalt, I think with 17 or so of minerals that we need are none of the friendliest places in

34:29.880 --> 34:30.520
the world for us.

34:32.280 --> 34:36.840
Well, we're, you know, we used to be one of the primary suppliers of many of these metals and

34:36.840 --> 34:37.240
minerals.

34:37.240 --> 34:41.480
US is geophysically rich in all these metals and minerals.

34:41.480 --> 34:43.000
But like, you know, there's nothing wrong.

34:43.960 --> 34:46.360
Count me in the free trade camp, right?

34:46.360 --> 34:48.360
I'm happy to trade with other countries.

34:48.360 --> 34:52.600
When you get trade concentration is when you get geopolitical risks and problems.

34:52.680 --> 34:56.920
And of course, the risk with China is beyond obvious.

34:56.920 --> 35:03.000
You don't have to be anti-China or pro-China to observe the fact that we're in economic

35:03.000 --> 35:04.040
conflict with them for sure.

35:04.040 --> 35:08.440
I hope it stays just an economic, we're certainly in political conflict with them.

35:08.440 --> 35:12.040
And so we've handed them and they've made this decision 20 years ago.

35:12.040 --> 35:13.640
It was public information.

35:13.640 --> 35:16.440
They published the fact of their goals.

35:16.440 --> 35:18.280
So we knew what they were planning to do.

35:18.280 --> 35:24.120
So now we have this sort of odd balance to pick up on what President Biden said and his

35:24.120 --> 35:26.840
Secretary of Energy have said, world's going to use oil for a long time.

35:27.880 --> 35:31.880
Another point to make is China is going to be dependent on oil and gas imports for a long time

35:31.880 --> 35:32.120
too.

35:32.760 --> 35:35.960
They can't, they can't match what we've done in the oil and gas world.

35:35.960 --> 35:37.560
They're not anywhere close to it.

35:37.560 --> 35:39.800
So they, they actually have a bargaining chip now.

35:39.800 --> 35:44.120
I mean, if you think about it in this simple geopolitical terms, they had no bargaining

35:44.120 --> 35:48.760
chips. They were very deeply dependent on vital energy imports to keep their economy running.

35:49.640 --> 35:55.240
We could, we could cause them a lot of pain both directly and indirectly in oil and gas

35:55.240 --> 35:56.440
markets, natural gas markets.

35:57.400 --> 36:01.320
Well, you know, they could cause an awful lot of pain to the world as the world increases

36:01.320 --> 36:06.200
its dependency on energy minerals to build windmills, solar arrays and electric batteries.

36:06.200 --> 36:09.160
So it's, it's not an accidental strategy.

36:09.160 --> 36:13.080
It's actually a brilliant strategy, especially when you consider they,

36:13.080 --> 36:17.240
they now have price control over those energy minerals, because they utterly dominate the

36:17.240 --> 36:19.080
market far more again, far more than OPEC.

36:19.800 --> 36:23.480
And we, we don't have any effective way to offset that price control,

36:24.440 --> 36:30.680
except to do the equivalent of what we did in the gas industry with minerals.

36:30.680 --> 36:31.880
Turns out that's a lot harder.

36:31.880 --> 36:37.720
I mean, the velocity of opening a mine versus the velocity of getting a oil well in place

36:37.720 --> 36:38.680
are profoundly different.

36:38.680 --> 36:39.800
They're just the different.

36:39.880 --> 36:45.240
This is like, I mean, to put it very simplistically, it's like the difference in the

36:45.240 --> 36:50.280
velocity of building a mining truck and building a go-kart.

36:50.280 --> 36:52.440
I mean, mines are huge.

36:52.440 --> 36:55.240
They take decades to, to build typically.

36:55.240 --> 36:59.080
The average in the world is 16 years to go from discovery to to happen.

36:59.080 --> 37:00.840
I recently heard you speak about a copper mine.

37:00.840 --> 37:05.240
How long does it take from start to finish to start to digging was 16?

37:05.240 --> 37:08.280
Yeah, the average IEA says is 16 years, but it could be,

37:08.760 --> 37:13.480
it could be 10 years in some, in some jurisdictions, if, if you're lucky, and it could be

37:13.480 --> 37:16.600
30 and others, infinite in the United States apparently.

37:17.240 --> 37:21.800
But if you wanted to compare that to the oil and gas world, the, the slowest,

37:22.600 --> 37:27.640
the most difficult projects in terms of velocity are offshore, offshore rakes, offshore oil projects.

37:28.200 --> 37:33.960
And one of the most remarkable accelerations that's occurred, sort of untold stories,

37:33.960 --> 37:37.160
is that that's been cut in half from a decade to five years roughly.

37:37.800 --> 37:41.880
But still five years to do a billion dollar offshore oil platform to go into production

37:41.880 --> 37:43.320
from, you know, discovery to production.

37:44.120 --> 37:47.080
A shale well from, you know, you don't have to discover a shale.

37:47.080 --> 37:47.720
We know where it is.

37:47.720 --> 37:49.000
I've always known where it is.

37:49.000 --> 37:54.520
But the decision, let's say decision to production in a shale well depends on where it is,

37:54.520 --> 37:57.160
but six months to a year, it's very, very quick.

37:58.120 --> 38:01.720
So you're looking at velocities in the oil and gas world

38:01.720 --> 38:05.960
that are literally 10 times faster than the velocities in the minerals world.

38:06.840 --> 38:13.720
And, and the minerals world's velocities are all attached to foreign jurisdictions,

38:13.720 --> 38:18.920
which are opaque, often corrupt, subject to bribes.

38:19.720 --> 38:25.480
It's, to, to labor practices that we, we, we would, when we know about them, find offensive.

38:25.480 --> 38:29.080
Child labor is rampant in the mining minerals world in Africa and South America.

38:29.880 --> 38:32.520
It's not, it's not up to say it's not a nice thing.

38:32.520 --> 38:36.920
It's a breathtaking understatement that, but it's generally ignored.

38:37.720 --> 38:41.560
As you know, I reviewed a book for the Wall Street Journal recently called Cobalt

38:41.560 --> 38:46.600
Red, which the author, professor of human trafficking and slavery in England,

38:47.880 --> 38:49.320
was pretty, pretty gutsy.

38:49.320 --> 38:54.440
He, he went down to Congo into East and Congo and went visiting the mine sites,

38:54.440 --> 38:58.360
which you're not supposed to visit to try to document the extent to which the cobalt

38:58.360 --> 39:02.680
mining in particular is done, what's called as euphemism, artisanally,

39:03.720 --> 39:08.200
which means by hand with a shovel and how much of that's with children.

39:08.200 --> 39:12.120
And of course, he reports that he thinks that the percentage that it's artisanal

39:12.680 --> 39:14.360
and child labor is vastly higher.

39:15.000 --> 39:22.760
The official estimates are something like 20% of the mining in, in Congo for cobalt is artisanal

39:22.760 --> 39:24.440
and maybe half that's with children.

39:25.160 --> 39:29.400
He thinks it's far higher, but even if it isn't far higher, it's pretty,

39:29.400 --> 39:31.400
it's pretty grotesque when you think about it.

39:32.280 --> 39:32.920
Does that matter?

39:32.920 --> 39:38.120
Well, yeah, because as he points out correctly, pretty much every lithium battery and every

39:38.120 --> 39:41.640
portable device has cobalt because you need it for the energy density.

39:42.440 --> 39:45.000
The majority of the world's electric car still use cobalt.

39:45.560 --> 39:49.000
And of course, those that don't use cobalt in their batteries, you can,

39:49.000 --> 39:50.360
you can switch up the chemistry.

39:50.360 --> 39:53.160
There's lots of different chemical soups you can use.

39:53.160 --> 39:55.160
You use typically more nickel, for example.

39:55.800 --> 39:58.440
So you're shifting your demand for one metal to another,

39:58.440 --> 40:03.000
which still takes you on the same path of foreign minds, foreign refining,

40:04.200 --> 40:08.840
questionable labor practices, all of which in principle can be fixed and made transparent.

40:08.840 --> 40:12.360
In principle, it's just, it's not there right now.

40:12.360 --> 40:13.080
It's not where we are.

40:14.120 --> 40:18.840
So, yeah, Siddharth Rathkarra, you're referring to a cobalt red.

40:19.880 --> 40:20.920
I'm going to have him on the show.

40:20.920 --> 40:21.960
He's just fascinating.

40:21.960 --> 40:22.600
He read his book.

40:22.600 --> 40:25.800
It was just unbelievable what he did exposing.

40:25.800 --> 40:29.080
And most of those minds in Congo were in partnership with the Chinese.

40:29.080 --> 40:30.520
They were there in 0809.

40:30.520 --> 40:34.200
They saw the opportunity right there that the world's going to need cobalt.

40:34.200 --> 40:38.200
And every lithium battery, I think it is, cobalt is part of.

40:39.320 --> 40:42.600
Well, in every high performance device, lithium battery.

40:42.600 --> 40:48.840
But the big, you can, you know, one can make lithium batteries with no cobalt at all.

40:48.840 --> 40:50.920
There's lithium iron phosphate batteries.

40:50.920 --> 40:52.440
There's nickel manganese batteries.

40:52.440 --> 40:54.440
There's lots of different chemical formulations.

40:54.440 --> 41:00.200
But as you change the chemical mix, you trade off things like temperature tolerance, fire,

41:00.200 --> 41:01.640
safety, range.

41:02.280 --> 41:06.520
The now favored lithium iron phosphate, which the pioneered in China,

41:07.240 --> 41:13.400
is a very clever battery chemistry, very safe chemistry, relatively speaking,

41:13.400 --> 41:15.800
and safer than the cobalt class batteries.

41:16.680 --> 41:18.120
But it has lower energy density.

41:18.120 --> 41:23.240
So you have to either have a bigger battery to get the range, which so instead of a thousand

41:23.240 --> 41:26.600
pound battery, it's 1200 pounds, which means more metals.

41:26.600 --> 41:28.200
Which means more aluminum, more FIFO, everything would be.

41:28.200 --> 41:30.200
Yeah, more copper, more aluminum, or.

41:30.200 --> 41:30.760
Pick your poison.

41:30.760 --> 41:33.560
Or you have less range, and everybody's trying to sell range.

41:33.560 --> 41:37.640
So in China, you don't have to sell range because there's lots of people without cars.

41:37.640 --> 41:43.160
So really small cars with okay range, which is what's going on as a first vehicle

41:44.120 --> 41:49.800
with arguably features and safety standards that most Americans won't buy and tolerate.

41:50.440 --> 41:51.800
It's a big market for them in China.

41:51.800 --> 41:53.320
So that'll be true in India.

41:53.320 --> 41:55.560
So I expect there's going to be lots more of those cars.

41:55.560 --> 41:59.800
In fact, China's export of their electric vehicles, if you track that data,

42:01.800 --> 42:06.520
they have become a powerhouse and not just producing electric vehicles,

42:06.520 --> 42:09.400
but exporting electric cars and vehicles in general.

42:09.400 --> 42:11.160
They're not to us.

42:11.160 --> 42:12.760
We're not buying them yet here.

42:12.760 --> 42:15.400
I think that'll happen, but to emerging markets, of course.

42:15.400 --> 42:21.320
Yeah, I think EYD just put a showroom together somewhere in the United States with their electric

42:21.320 --> 42:22.840
bus, which looks unbelievable.

42:23.640 --> 42:25.160
They're going to get a flip to the toehold here.

42:27.000 --> 42:35.320
I think probably one of the best engineered batteries for a car in the world is still a Tesla.

42:35.320 --> 42:40.440
Dick Elon Musk's focus in this early before everybody else gave him a huge head start,

42:40.440 --> 42:41.160
terrific team.

42:41.880 --> 42:43.480
The engineering is absolutely brilliant.

42:43.480 --> 42:49.560
It really is the level of the energy density and safety and quality on the battery.

42:49.560 --> 42:50.920
I'm not talking about the car overall.

42:50.920 --> 42:54.680
The car is fine, but it's not a standout in terms of quality.

42:54.680 --> 42:55.560
It's just fine.

42:56.840 --> 42:58.040
But the battery is impressive.

42:58.040 --> 43:00.280
And the rest of the world is catching up.

43:00.280 --> 43:04.120
They'll probably get to pair up a suit with him in due course.

43:04.600 --> 43:12.600
I would say BYD's batteries probably pretty much on par with Tesla's engineering, getting there.

43:12.600 --> 43:14.520
Chinese engineering on this stuff is very good.

43:14.520 --> 43:15.800
They've been at it a very long time.

43:17.240 --> 43:19.400
I've traveled to China several times.

43:19.400 --> 43:25.240
I've been in maybe, I think, 12 or 14 Chinese cities, visited battery factories there and

43:25.240 --> 43:27.320
electric car factories and bus factories.

43:27.320 --> 43:30.200
This was pre-epic lockdowns, of course.

43:31.160 --> 43:32.680
This is the last few years.

43:32.680 --> 43:34.280
It's a little more difficult lately.

43:35.480 --> 43:40.040
A friend of mine just went there and told me he was put into quarantine 10 days anyway,

43:40.040 --> 43:43.640
despite negative tests, passports, visas, vaxes.

43:43.640 --> 43:45.560
He still had to be quarantined.

43:45.560 --> 43:47.960
So I hope it was a nice hotel.

43:47.960 --> 43:49.160
Probably was, knowing him.

43:50.600 --> 43:52.280
Here's the thing that's sort of puzzling to me about,

43:53.720 --> 43:56.200
and I think it's in people's heads about electric cars.

43:56.200 --> 43:58.760
I'll come back to the mythology of this.

43:58.920 --> 44:01.240
There are elsewhere omissions and lots of omissions.

44:01.960 --> 44:04.760
It's elsewhere dependencies, elsewhere jobs.

44:04.760 --> 44:05.960
All those things are all true.

44:06.600 --> 44:11.800
But there's this sort of naive belief that it's a simpler vehicle.

44:11.800 --> 44:15.080
I mean, look, it's just a battery and electric motor.

44:15.080 --> 44:16.040
What could be simpler?

44:16.040 --> 44:16.920
Look at that.

44:16.920 --> 44:19.080
It's got to be inherently cheaper to make eventually.

44:21.560 --> 44:24.840
If that were true, if they were inherently simpler,

44:24.840 --> 44:26.120
that might be true.

44:26.120 --> 44:27.640
It would be inherently cheaper to make.

44:27.640 --> 44:28.840
But it's not true.

44:28.840 --> 44:31.400
The battery is not like the little double-A cell

44:31.400 --> 44:33.320
you stick in a child's toy.

44:33.320 --> 44:38.440
This half-ton engine, it's actually an electrochemical engine,

44:39.000 --> 44:40.600
has thousands of parts in it.

44:41.480 --> 44:44.360
If it's a Tesla battery, maybe tens of thousands of parts,

44:44.360 --> 44:48.520
but lots of batteries, thousands of parts, tens of thousands of welds,

44:48.520 --> 44:52.440
cooling systems, electronic control systems, structural systems.

44:52.440 --> 44:57.000
It's a complicated, multi-thousand-part electrochemical engine.

44:57.640 --> 44:58.520
The motor is simple.

44:58.520 --> 45:00.040
Electric motor has two moving parts.

45:00.760 --> 45:04.280
In an internal combustion engine, we just flop the complexities.

45:04.840 --> 45:07.240
The fuel tank has two moving parts.

45:07.240 --> 45:10.920
It's an electric motor that pumps your fuel, two moving parts.

45:10.920 --> 45:11.720
A little tiny one.

45:12.520 --> 45:13.400
The tank has nothing yet.

45:13.400 --> 45:14.840
It's just fluid.

45:15.400 --> 45:17.320
The engine, on the other hand,

45:17.320 --> 45:20.280
instead of being an electrochemical engine with thousands of parts,

45:20.280 --> 45:23.320
it's a thermochemical engine with thousands of parts.

45:24.280 --> 45:27.960
We've just swapped mechanical, thermo-mechanical complexity

45:27.960 --> 45:30.040
for electrochemical complexities.

45:30.040 --> 45:31.320
They're both complex.

45:31.880 --> 45:35.880
They both wear out at the molecular level.

45:35.880 --> 45:38.360
Wear and tear on an engine with reciprocating parts

45:38.360 --> 45:39.880
is literally at the molecular level.

45:41.320 --> 45:46.440
Batteries wear out, electrochemistry wears out at the molecular level.

45:46.440 --> 45:50.680
They both have performance characteristics that vary with temperature,

45:51.400 --> 45:53.400
all kinds of both have safety issues.

45:54.920 --> 45:59.400
The difference between them is that the complicated fuel tank

46:00.520 --> 46:05.880
in an electric car is made of expensive minerals

46:05.880 --> 46:09.320
as opposed to cheap iron ore and steel.

46:10.200 --> 46:15.240
The mineral costs that go into a battery constitute about 70% or 80%

46:15.240 --> 46:16.920
of the cost to make the battery.

46:16.920 --> 46:19.800
Once you know that we now are making batteries so efficiently,

46:20.280 --> 46:22.680
if I took all the labor out and said the labor was free,

46:23.480 --> 46:26.440
the capital and the overhead for the automated machines is free,

46:27.240 --> 46:31.960
that would reduce the cost of a battery by 20%, 25%.

46:31.960 --> 46:32.440
That's it.

46:34.200 --> 46:35.160
It's not game-changing.

46:35.160 --> 46:37.400
What you're left with is, put differently,

46:37.400 --> 46:40.360
is the future cost of batteries for electric cars,

46:40.360 --> 46:42.520
which dominates the cost of the electric car,

46:42.520 --> 46:45.080
is entirely dependent on the future of the mining industry.

46:46.200 --> 46:48.920
What we're making a bet on when we tell people

46:48.920 --> 46:50.760
they won't be able to buy internal combustion engines

46:50.760 --> 46:53.800
is a bet that the mining industry will cooperate

46:53.800 --> 46:56.360
and provide both enough minerals and metals

46:56.360 --> 46:59.080
and cheaply enough to keep consumers happy.

46:59.080 --> 47:03.240
The mining operations in parts of the world

47:03.240 --> 47:05.320
which are not the friendliest in the United States.

47:07.240 --> 47:08.040
Well, they're not here.

47:08.040 --> 47:10.440
And they're also, I mean, the most important point, of course,

47:10.440 --> 47:12.280
is that the cost of these minerals has been rising.

47:12.280 --> 47:18.120
So a lot of the 2022 price spikes and everything

47:18.120 --> 47:21.720
have come off of the highs, including inflation overall.

47:21.720 --> 47:23.800
Inflation is still at a 40-year high.

47:23.800 --> 47:25.640
In fact, it's a 50-year high,

47:25.640 --> 47:27.560
but it's below the peak of last summer.

47:28.280 --> 47:30.440
Mineral prices similarly are still at highs.

47:30.440 --> 47:33.000
They're about, depending on the basket you choose,

47:33.000 --> 47:34.840
but the kind of metals that go into batteries,

47:34.840 --> 47:37.480
electric cars, nickel, copper, aluminum,

47:37.480 --> 47:40.040
they're all about 200% to 300% more expensive

47:40.040 --> 47:40.920
than five years ago.

47:41.640 --> 47:45.480
Aluminum is at multi-decade highs still.

47:45.480 --> 47:49.400
The lithium is still, instead of being 1,800% more expensive,

47:49.400 --> 47:53.960
it's only 900% more expensive than it was five years ago.

47:53.960 --> 47:56.360
So all the minerals and metals are going into

47:56.360 --> 47:58.680
making electric vehicles and solar arrays

47:58.680 --> 48:00.040
have become more expensive,

48:00.040 --> 48:02.520
which is driving up the cost of those machines.

48:02.520 --> 48:05.080
So the last year and this year and next year,

48:05.800 --> 48:07.320
batteries are getting more expensive,

48:07.320 --> 48:09.960
have got more expensive, wind turbines are got more expensive,

48:09.960 --> 48:11.080
are going to get more expensive.

48:11.640 --> 48:15.080
Same with solar and all of them have the same characteristic.

48:15.080 --> 48:20.840
They all depend for their price forecasts

48:20.840 --> 48:24.360
on the availability and price of the input minerals and metals.

48:24.360 --> 48:28.040
So the most important thing that's being missed

48:28.040 --> 48:32.040
in all the ambitious plans to make this energy transition

48:32.600 --> 48:35.480
is acknowledgement that every one of the plans,

48:35.480 --> 48:38.680
there's no exception, all plans in all countries,

48:39.400 --> 48:41.400
all the aspirants to this transition,

48:42.040 --> 48:45.160
a certain belief that the costs of these machines

48:45.160 --> 48:48.200
will get cheaper, not a little bit, by a lot in the future.

48:48.200 --> 48:51.480
All of them are asserting and model all of their forecasts

48:51.480 --> 48:53.640
on every declining costs for electric cars,

48:53.640 --> 48:55.800
their batteries, windmills and solar arrays.

48:57.000 --> 49:04.120
That model, those claims are profoundly and completely dependent

49:04.120 --> 49:05.640
on the cost of the metals and minerals.

49:06.280 --> 49:09.400
And about that, I would take the bet.

49:09.400 --> 49:10.760
Those are not going to go down,

49:10.760 --> 49:13.160
but I just want to know on what basis they're assuming

49:13.160 --> 49:15.960
these things will get cheaper at the rate that they're claiming.

49:15.960 --> 49:21.160
That is, put differently, for the battery to go down by 50% in price,

49:22.200 --> 49:25.160
electric car batteries about $10,000 to make, roughly.

49:26.200 --> 49:27.720
So for it to become,

49:27.720 --> 49:29.880
and that's about what the average price premium is

49:29.880 --> 49:32.200
for electric car over conventional car.

49:32.920 --> 49:36.680
This roughly, setting aside the really expensive high-end cars

49:36.680 --> 49:38.600
which comprise 5% of market.

49:38.600 --> 49:41.000
We're talking about the cars that people drive every day,

49:41.000 --> 49:45.400
the $22,000 Nissan, the $22,000 Toyota.

49:45.400 --> 49:47.400
To make that an electric vehicle,

49:47.400 --> 49:50.280
you basically increase its cost by $8,000 or $10,000.

49:50.280 --> 49:51.000
The input costs.

49:52.040 --> 49:56.040
To cost parity, the battery has to be free, essentially.

49:56.040 --> 49:57.560
Because internal combustion engines don't cost much.

49:57.560 --> 49:58.920
The government has to give a subsidy.

49:59.880 --> 50:01.480
Well, okay.

50:02.040 --> 50:05.240
But what's going on, and we've already seen this,

50:05.240 --> 50:06.920
is when the government gives the subsidies,

50:06.920 --> 50:08.440
the car doesn't get cheaper.

50:08.440 --> 50:11.080
The automaker keeps the price at that,

50:11.080 --> 50:15.000
and they raise the price and extract the benefit for themselves.

50:15.640 --> 50:16.600
But you're right.

50:16.600 --> 50:18.840
In principle, you could subsidize it enough to make it cheaper.

50:18.840 --> 50:19.160
Sure.

50:20.840 --> 50:22.360
I guess the real question is,

50:22.360 --> 50:25.240
what percentage of cars are governments willing to subsidize?

50:25.240 --> 50:26.440
100% of them, apparently,

50:26.440 --> 50:29.880
because if we ban internal combustion engines entirely,

50:30.680 --> 50:33.720
unless the electric car gets cheaper,

50:34.760 --> 50:37.400
then we're going to have to subsidize every car everybody buys.

50:37.400 --> 50:39.720
But Mark, do we have enough minerals in the world

50:41.400 --> 50:42.200
to make these cars?

50:42.200 --> 50:51.560
Or do we have enough copper to replace 1.4 billion light vehicles throughout the world?

50:52.360 --> 50:53.240
Yes, Howard.

50:54.200 --> 50:56.440
The question has to be phrased carefully,

50:56.440 --> 50:59.880
because for this reason, and this is not to criticize you, Charles,

50:59.880 --> 51:02.120
is because the answer to the question,

51:02.120 --> 51:04.520
are there enough minerals in the world, is unequivocally yes.

51:05.160 --> 51:09.080
Because I've been accused recently of something that was the deepest cut

51:09.080 --> 51:11.480
that's ever been leveled against me in my career.

51:11.480 --> 51:13.320
I was called a Malthusian for saying

51:13.320 --> 51:15.320
that we don't have enough minerals in the world,

51:15.320 --> 51:18.040
as if I'm the anti-Malthusian.

51:18.360 --> 51:23.480
Anyway, there are enough metals and minerals in the Earth's crust.

51:23.480 --> 51:27.800
This is not, in fact, that some researchers recently at MIT put out a study

51:27.800 --> 51:28.920
to prove the obvious.

51:28.920 --> 51:33.240
There are enough minerals in the world to finance all cars being electric.

51:33.240 --> 51:34.120
Yes, of course there are.

51:34.120 --> 51:34.840
That's not the point.

51:35.720 --> 51:39.800
The point really implicit in this is, are we now mining enough,

51:40.600 --> 51:45.320
and are the world's mines investing in enough expansion

51:45.320 --> 51:48.360
to provide that quantity of copper and aluminum and nickel?

51:48.360 --> 51:50.200
And for that, we know the answer.

51:50.200 --> 51:52.680
And again, courtesy of the International Energy Agency,

51:52.680 --> 51:57.880
we want to have to increase the mining of things like copper by nearly 300%,

51:57.880 --> 52:04.200
things like lithium by something about 500%, for graphite by about 800% or 1,000%.

52:05.320 --> 52:11.720
The increase in mining required to meet this are numbers that have never been seen,

52:12.360 --> 52:13.960
I mean, literally in modern history.

52:14.680 --> 52:20.040
But more importantly, even if you naively thought you could expand mines that fast enough,

52:20.040 --> 52:23.000
you would want to ask the obvious question.

52:23.000 --> 52:28.200
Are the world's mining industries announcing plans and investments in the coming decade

52:28.200 --> 52:31.160
that are even close to what's required?

52:31.160 --> 52:35.000
And there are businesses that follow this stuff, Reistad does.

52:36.360 --> 52:38.440
There are mining analysts that follow this stuff.

52:38.440 --> 52:40.920
Wood McKenzie has put out very good data on this.

52:41.640 --> 52:47.880
Roughly speaking, the world's mining industry is investing about 10% of what's required

52:47.880 --> 52:51.880
to meet 2330 goals, 10% of what's required.

52:51.880 --> 52:57.320
Or put differently, we're going to miss the availability of the metals to make enough

52:57.320 --> 53:00.120
electric vehicles by 2030 by a factor of 10.

53:00.120 --> 53:01.480
Amazing.

53:01.480 --> 53:02.600
Absolutely amazing.

53:02.600 --> 53:08.040
And by the way, just to close with this, even if we got rid of all of the 1.4

53:08.040 --> 53:11.320
billion light vehicles on the road today that suck up gas,

53:11.960 --> 53:14.200
what are we saving in the world's fuel consumption?

53:14.200 --> 53:17.400
Because like you said, the fuel is going to have to go somewhere.

53:17.400 --> 53:20.760
We're going to need fuel in order to make all these other things.

53:20.760 --> 53:22.360
So what would be the net savings?

53:23.640 --> 53:27.720
If you could wave the wand, which we sort of did with lockdowns.

53:27.720 --> 53:29.960
We stopped people from driving as much.

53:29.960 --> 53:35.240
If you could wave the wand, you could eliminate about a quarter of the world's oil use.

53:35.320 --> 53:40.280
If you did overnight, no more driving of internal combustion engine vehicles,

53:40.280 --> 53:41.720
like duty vehicles, small trucks.

53:43.320 --> 53:47.160
From a viewpoint of overall hydrocarbon use, oil, gas, and coal combined,

53:49.160 --> 53:52.520
your total reduction is about 7% of the world's hydrocarbon use.

53:52.520 --> 53:55.240
But remember, the wand waving is not happening.

53:55.240 --> 53:57.080
We're looking at 20 years.

53:57.080 --> 54:01.240
20 years from now, the increased consumption of oil for the mining machinery,

54:01.240 --> 54:06.040
for aviation, for heavy trucks and delivery, shipping, all the other factors

54:06.040 --> 54:11.880
would mean that even if you could get to 100% electric vehicle penetration 20 years from now,

54:11.880 --> 54:19.080
you would eliminate, by my estimation, about 12 to 15% of the world's oil use at that time.

54:19.080 --> 54:20.120
So that's something.

54:21.240 --> 54:22.280
It's a lot of oil.

54:22.280 --> 54:26.840
But the more important question that you'd have to ask if your strategist or an analyst is,

54:27.720 --> 54:29.720
who's producing the other 80% to 90%?

54:29.720 --> 54:30.520
Where's it coming from?

54:30.920 --> 54:33.240
Who's investing in that?

54:33.240 --> 54:34.760
Well, you know, OPEC is.

54:34.760 --> 54:36.760
Russia will continue to do that.

54:37.320 --> 54:41.640
China is investing in oil and gas expansion in their country and offshore on their shores.

54:41.640 --> 54:43.080
I saw the last eight quarters.

54:43.720 --> 54:50.120
On average, the U.S. oil industry has not been spending in due to the administration

54:50.120 --> 54:54.280
and political risk into capital expenditures and to drilling.

54:54.280 --> 54:55.160
So that's eight quarters.

54:55.160 --> 54:57.000
So our supply is greatly lagged.

54:57.000 --> 54:59.160
And suppose you put a big frame around this.

54:59.160 --> 55:03.400
We're talking about 100 million barrels a day is what we're sucking up, right?

55:03.400 --> 55:06.840
So even if the world consumes 100 million barrels a day,

55:06.840 --> 55:11.240
so even 30 years, let's say 20 years out, so with 10% reduction,

55:11.240 --> 55:14.680
we're still going to be using 90 million barrels or so a day at the best.

55:14.680 --> 55:15.240
But who knows?

55:15.240 --> 55:18.200
Maybe we'll 80%, 80 million.

55:18.200 --> 55:19.480
It's not zero.

55:19.480 --> 55:21.560
Anyone who thinks it's zero is.

55:21.560 --> 55:22.440
Well, that's the problem.

55:22.440 --> 55:28.520
Even if you imagine the scenario is wildly optimistic as you get to all,

55:29.320 --> 55:34.280
in fact, electric cars are at price parity or subsidized to be a price parity.

55:34.280 --> 55:37.000
And you get you get rid of 20 million barrels per day of oil.

55:37.640 --> 55:41.080
You still have to produce at least 80 if nothing else grows.

55:41.720 --> 55:45.160
And since other things will grow, you're still going to have to produce closer to 90

55:45.160 --> 55:46.520
million barrels per day.

55:46.520 --> 55:49.960
So the question that's important because it's only 20 years away that we're going to

55:49.960 --> 55:53.160
force this quote transition, it's back to where we started.

55:53.160 --> 55:55.640
This is not a transition, right?

55:55.640 --> 55:58.120
This is not a transition away from oil use.

55:58.840 --> 56:01.480
It's a reduction in oil use, even if it were to happen.

56:01.480 --> 56:05.560
But it's not a transition away from the need for hydrocarbons.

56:05.560 --> 56:09.480
And to make it apolitical, to your point under this administration's

56:09.480 --> 56:13.800
hostility to oil and gas, which has been moderated by the president's

56:13.800 --> 56:20.840
intemperate off-script remarks, okay, I'll give him credit for doing it because

56:20.840 --> 56:24.040
he had to have been realizing as soon as he started saying it what he was saying.

56:24.040 --> 56:29.320
He's not, whatever other people think, he's pretty aware of what he's saying.

56:29.320 --> 56:34.200
He may have loose lips, but a lot of presidents have had loose lips when they're talking.

56:35.320 --> 56:40.840
Here's the thing is that it's not just under this presidency or the previous presidency

56:40.840 --> 56:42.840
where it was much more enthusiasm, oil and gas.

56:42.840 --> 56:46.680
But if we look at the global oil and gas industry, so we get out of the United States

56:47.240 --> 56:53.000
and we look at the behaviors of capital markets broadly where the investments come from both

56:53.560 --> 56:59.400
both the private markets, private banks, and public banks, if you like, the international

56:59.400 --> 57:04.440
banking system, especially the European banking system, it's been hostile to oil and gas investment

57:04.440 --> 57:11.240
for about 15 years. And so if we charted the total capital expenditures of the oil and gas

57:11.240 --> 57:20.200
industry globally in new production, it started going down like off a cliff 15 years ago.

57:20.200 --> 57:24.360
And then when COVID hit and then this president was elected, the combination

57:24.360 --> 57:32.440
accelerated down. So we're now at epic lows that began, predates US lack of enthusiasm,

57:32.440 --> 57:38.280
let's call it. Let's give the administration credit for giving a permit to Conoco Phillips

57:38.280 --> 57:45.880
for dealing in Alaska, even though the jury is out as whether or not they've also put it into place,

57:46.840 --> 57:51.640
we'll call it the expedite rules or at least arbitration rules so that they can get it built

57:51.640 --> 57:56.360
as quickly as they built the original oil production in Alaska. So they don't, it's just

57:56.360 --> 58:00.360
it'll never get built under litigation. So that should bring in 180,000 barrels

58:00.360 --> 58:06.520
when that's up and running. But it's a huge fine, right? I mean, a really productive

58:07.720 --> 58:13.000
shale well, and that's like putting a couple hundred really productive shale wells in place

58:13.080 --> 58:19.560
all at once. I mean, it's a big deal when they get it going. So we have this general

58:19.560 --> 58:24.600
antipathy in the investment world, private and public, and a lot of social and public pressure,

58:24.600 --> 58:30.120
a lot of overt pressure, not to invest net new money in oil and gas globally. And it's had the

58:30.120 --> 58:35.560
effect that was intended. The investment's gone down. It's had the effect. And the fact that

58:35.560 --> 58:39.560
sort of everybody knows if you're an analyst, but it's, you don't have to understand the

58:39.560 --> 58:46.600
only gas industry to know this important fact. You have to, just like food, you have to plant

58:46.600 --> 58:50.840
crops every year. In the oil and gas business, when you consume energy from oil from a well

58:50.840 --> 58:57.080
or gas, the well eventually is exhausted. It's capacity. So you have to plant new,

58:57.880 --> 59:02.600
the exploration each year and development is the equivalent of planting new food each year.

59:02.600 --> 59:07.560
And we know the decline rate, the global decline rate for all the world's oil wells. If we stopped

59:07.640 --> 59:12.440
investing in new ones tomorrow with the zero, every year we'd have about six or seven million

59:12.440 --> 59:18.200
barrels per day less oil available to the world. So we'll put differently. We have to

59:18.200 --> 59:27.880
find and put into production oil output pretty close to what Texas does every year globally.

59:29.000 --> 59:32.680
Without making a prediction, because I know that's not what you're doing. I hate predictions,

59:33.240 --> 59:39.400
my episodically get into the game of predicting. I get trapped into and

59:39.400 --> 59:44.040
have to make predictions the case that we all do. This is simple economics 101.

59:44.040 --> 59:49.880
Supply is shrinking and being crimped and not being replaced even at the rate of seven million

59:49.880 --> 59:54.600
barrels a year. We're consuming, even if we stay at 100 million, but we know that's not the case.

59:54.600 --> 59:59.800
China was reopening, India, other development countries want the same benefits we all have

59:59.800 --> 01:00:05.880
is electricity 24-7 or the availability of that. No brownouts on that. Even if that stays the same,

01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:11.560
we're in a situation the way I see it, where five years or so from now, how could oil prices not be

01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:18.040
higher? Yeah, I think if you know, the thing about oil prices is if you're really good at

01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:22.520
predicting them, especially in the mid-short-term, you're a very wealthy person, as we all know.

01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:28.440
It's true for all commodities. So commodities are impacted by lots of variables, but with

01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:35.880
oil it's easy. Oil is still utterly deeply tied to our economy, first of all, since to state an

01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:42.520
obvious fact, 98% of all the world's movement of goods and people is moved by burning oil,

01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:51.960
98%. And if you get all the EVs to happen in the next 20 years, maybe you get it down to 90%.

01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:59.320
So the world moves people and goods, things we need and things we want by burning oil.

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:07.400
So if you have a recession, people move less and buy less stuff. So you're reduced to, in

01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:11.800
simplistic terms, moving only the essentials, food and things you have to have and have to

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:16.680
replace. You just put everything off. So a really deep recession can really, really put off the

01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:21.640
day of reckoning. And I think we're on track for a recession. I'm not a great predictor of

01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:27.640
things, but given inflation and interest rates and market psychology and the banking challenges,

01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:32.040
it sort of feels like we're already in a mild recession, at least. The world doesn't like

01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:37.720
recessions. The world always comes out of recessions. Even the Great Depression, we came out of it

01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:45.800
eventually. So the bet you're making to your point is whenever the recession is however long we delay

01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:53.160
the oil-consuming impact of growth again, because all growth, including the enthusiastic world,

01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:58.040
will result in more oil demand, not less. For the near future, let's forget whether we're

01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:02.840
going to have 20 or 30 years. So for the near five years or so. Yeah, five, 10 year future.

01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:07.080
So this is what you would look at. You'd look at the decline curve and the investment numbers.

01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:12.760
And those are two public numbers. The decline curve we know, the investment's down. So we know

01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:20.680
for a fact that a day in the not distant future could be 18 months, could be as soon as 18 months.

01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:25.560
If we dodge a really bad recession, it could happen. If it's a geopolitical event,

01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:30.600
it could be even sooner. So who knows? Can I give you a scenario? Here's an

01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:39.320
optimist scenario, the pessimistic outcome. Peace breaks out in Ukraine and Putin leaves

01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:45.480
office, doesn't have a heart attack, he retires, he's deposed, whatever. So that Russia gets out of

01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:52.200
the penalty box and the world wants to buy its oil and gas again. Here's a factor that's not being

01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:57.800
threaded into the discussion about future oil prices. Russia is one of the world's biggest

01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:03.080
oil exporters. They export 7 million barrels per day. They export much more than we do. They are

01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:09.160
like OPEC, the big dogs in oil export. But their oil is being sold at about a 40% discount to market.

01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:14.120
Because they're in the penalty box. We sanctioned them so everybody else is buying a discount.

01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:19.560
If you're, you don't have to again be an oil trader or an economist to know, if for the first time in

01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:25.240
history, the biggest, one of the biggest exporters of a commodity in the world market

01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:30.440
has having to sell its stuff for a 40% off of prevailing price, that has dragged the world

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:36.280
price down. If you add to that a mild recession, which is where we're sitting, if you get growth,

01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:39.720
so growth will come back if peace breaks out in part because people be enthusiastic,

01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:46.440
they have the spirits, all which would be great. Let's pray Xi negotiates a piece, pray that Putin

01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:51.960
is exits the world stage in some fashion that we're all comfortable with, whatever that is.

01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:57.960
And oil demand goes up and they start trading oil in the market again. Wow.

01:03:57.960 --> 01:03:59.400
But the real price.

01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:05.080
It just do the math here. I mean, take 7 million barrels per day, which gets you to sort of a

01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:10.760
what's that about 3 billion barrels of oil a year going at a discount of 30 to $4 a barrel.

01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:18.360
So there's a $100 billion a year discount in oil going on now because of the current price, right?

01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:23.640
That's reflected on the current price. I mean, you could argue it's a good thing that there's

01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:30.360
less money flowing to potentates who sell oil, including Putin. We're doing fine and miss record

01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:33.960
profits for Exxon and the shale guys are making a lot of money at these prices.

01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:40.040
But the bigger economic and political question and the one out of scare politicians witless

01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:43.240
is growth comes back and peace breaks out.

01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:49.240
What we don't want, and this is what I think Chairman Powell knows, by the way,

01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:56.760
I think he's a very smart guy, when he answered a question that he was put to him last week and

01:04:56.760 --> 01:05:00.840
Senate hearings about inflation and the tool he has, which is interest rates.

01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:05.000
We're talking about what the other things are that might push inflation. Well,

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:11.000
the Federal Reserve has published pretty good academic papers on the other things like systemic

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:16.360
increase in commodity prices, not an episodic increase. If you push oil back to $100 a barrel,

01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:20.760
leave it there for, I don't know, four or five years instead of four or five months.

01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:27.800
I mean, this is inflationary. If it's high enough, it creates recessions by itself.

01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:32.360
This is when we had our high oil prices, it acts like a tax on the American people.

01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:33.800
It is a tax revenue.

01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:37.320
Driving your car, you have to now figure out if I'm traveling 50 miles a day to work,

01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:41.560
it's going to cost you X percent more. And I remember back last year in February time,

01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:47.480
there were calculations that I don't remember ever thinking about and hearing about that I heard

01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:52.520
in the 70s of, well, I only could fill up today and here's what it cost. All of a sudden energy

01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:56.520
became a big factor and I'm in New York and I'm seeing what my gas bills are,

01:05:57.240 --> 01:06:02.680
my natural gas bill each month and my electric bill, they've gone through the roof. And this is at

01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:10.440
a discounted price of crude oil. Amazing. So let's use the language that everybody now understands

01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:15.000
if they read papers, systemic risk, right? That when you have policies that create

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:21.560
quote systemic risk, so what do we do with the policy of zero percent money? We create an

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:26.280
systemic risk inflation. When you inflate the cost of money, you have a systemic risk and you end

01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:34.600
up with bank failures. So we understand the bludgeoning of markets with ham-handed tools that

01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:42.360
have systemic impacts create systemic risks. So let me just use that language. When you create

01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:48.360
an environment in which the world is underinvesting in its primary source of moving goods and

01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:56.840
people, oil, you've created a systemic risk and that systemic risk is calculable. We know

01:06:57.640 --> 01:07:03.240
we have lots of data, just like in the financial markets, what happens if you create an environment

01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:09.160
at which the markets demand for oil exceeds its supply systemically, not because there's a brief

01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:14.360
war in the Middle East. This is a long-term trend and that's what I've been going over my

01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:20.200
numbers and looking at this for the past year and I'm saying myself, how could oil not be higher

01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:26.360
five years from now? I'm glad you just laid out the facts. Mark, we've got to have you on again.

01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:31.000
I can speak to you for hours and hours and hours, folks. Mark Mills, the name of his latest book,

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:35.000
really definitely worth reading, even though it's, let me just say the name of it, the Cloud

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:40.520
Revolution, how the convergence of new technologies will unleash the next economic boom in our roaring

01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:46.280
2020s is a fantastic, I think about six or 70 pages there about energy in that book.

01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:53.080
Yeah, really great stuff. Well worth reading and I think it's really enlightening because you

01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:58.600
go into research and everyone talks about but no one thinks about. I appreciate that. I mean,

01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:04.840
I guess the reason I'm frustrated at us creating systemic risk of high cost energy

01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:08.760
is that we're sitting on the cusp as I try to outline in my book, as you know,

01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:14.520
of one of the greatest economic expansion opportunities in the century and growth brings

01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:19.160
energy demand. If you make energy expensive, you constrain the growth. It's not that it

01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:24.840
will never happen, is that you push it off in time and of course we all know time value amounting

01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:28.360
money matters. I mean, if somebody tells you, I'm going to give you a raise in 10 years,

01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:33.560
you're not as happy as getting a smaller raise tomorrow. Amazing. For obvious reasons.

01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:38.120
All right, Mark, I want to thank you once again, man. Best of luck to you and keep doing the great

01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:44.200
work that you do. I follow you when you're speaking on YouTube. You write tons of papers

01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:47.960
and really amazing stuff. Keep going for the next 20 years.

01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:56.280
Thank you. Thanks. Good to be on and as you know, my podcast is The Last Optimist. I'm still

01:08:56.280 --> 01:09:00.120
a stubborn optimist. Oh yeah, Last Optimist by the way, folks. Definitely worth listening to.

01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:04.920
